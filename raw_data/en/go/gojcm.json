FeachemExecutive Director,The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria \"Deadly diseases like AIDS that devastate developing countries are not only a humanitarian issue, they are a security issue for the United States. To develop vaccines against the world's most dangerous diseases, the international community will have to think more strategically and act more collaboratively than it has in the past. This book is an important contribution to that effort. \" Sen. Richard G.

Making Markets for Vaccines goes to the heart of one of the most tragic market failures of our times. A workable solution has now been proposed. \" Trevor ManuelMinister of Finance,South Africa \"Two steps are essential to improving health in developing countries: research and development into new, potentially life-saving products must be substantially increased, and markets and delivery systems must be strengthened to ensure access to those products. This important book explores promising new mechanisms to address both these imperatives, which could eventually save many of the millions of lives lost every year to the world's deadliest diseases. \" Patty Stonesifer Co-Chair and President,Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation \"The innovative ideas presented in this book are intended to provide incentives to the private sector to conduct research and development to address the major killer diseases of the poor in the developing world. It offers specic and creative proposals for utilizing market mechanisms to address one of the critical challenges facing the world today. These proposals merit the support of all those concerned about these global challenges.

That ideas should freely spread from one to another over the globe, for the moral and mutual instruction of man, and improvement of his condi - tion, seems to have been peculiarly and benevolently designed by nature...\" \u2014Thomas Jefferson, August 13, 1813 In the time it takes you to read this preface, 100 people will die of diseases that can already be prevented with vaccines, and 150 more will die of malaria, HIV or tuberculosis. If American or European children were dying at a rate of an average-sized high school every hour, it would lead the news every day. We would be devoting serious resources to nding a cure urgently. But the people who die are too poor to command that sort of attention. Just 10% of the world's research and development on health is targeted on diseases affecting 90% of the world's people. Of more than a thousand new medicines developed over the last 25 years, just 1% were specically for diseases of tropi - cal countries. There is not enough research and development because tech - nological progress is a global public good. In the case of tropical diseases, no single individual enterprise has an incentive to pay for the full costs of developing new medicines. As a result, we invest far too little as a global community. Nation-states have developed institutions, however imperfect, to invest in public goods, and these mutual commitments form part of the fabric of society. Nations provide security and nan - cial stability, enforce contracts, protect the environment, limit inequality and poverty and invest in knowledge that enriches all their citizens. No doubt most countries could do these things bet - ter, but even so the provision of these common goods underpins the domestic social contract.At the global level, by contrast, we lack institutions capable of providing and protecting global public goods. We have only sketchy arrangements to improve international security and main - tain nancial stability and little or nothing to preserve the envi - ronment, to provide a safety net against poverty or to invest in technological progress that would benet all humanity. We lack adequate mechanisms to deliver a global social contract, in which those who can afford it make a fair contribution to the global society in which they live. It is the poor who suffer most from the lack of public goods. While the rich can to some extent insulate themselves through private affluence, the poor shoulder the burden of public penury. Of course, the rich cannot shield themselves completely: in the long run, global public penury leads to an endless battle against illegal immigration, spread of infectious disease, proliferation of weapons, organized crime and drugs and spillovers of conflict. Our failure to invest in the global commons flows not from our indifference but from our impotence, because we do not have incentives or mechanisms to coordinate our efforts to invest. We at the Center for Global Development have sought ways to attack this problem\u2014to strengthen the mechanisms, the incen - tives and the institutions that could underpin a more compre - hensive global social contract. Nowhere are the potential benets greater than in the pro - duction and distribution of new vaccines to prevent the diseases that needlessly take lives and destroy livelihoods in developing countries. In 2003 we established a Working Group, including econo - mists, public health professionals, lawyers, experts in public policy and pharmaceutical and biotech experts, with the mandate to develop a practical approach to the vaccine challenge: to go from ideas to action. The result is this report. My colleagues propose an elegant solution to enable the high- income countries to work together to accelerate the development of vaccines for diseases of low-income countries\u2014to guarantee to CGD 0414.indd 7 4/14/05 1:31:45 PMMaking Markets for Vaccinesviii pay for such vaccines if and when they are developed. The solu - tion is simple and practical. It unleashes the same combination of market incentives and public investment that creates medicines for diseases that afflict us: arrangements that have been spectacularly effective in improving the health of the rich nations in the last century. It creates incentives for more private investment in these diseases. And it will ensure that, once a vaccine is developed, the funds will be there to get the vaccine to the people who need it. Adequate investment in global public goods should be a cor - nerstone of foreign assistance. By denition, we all benet from global public goods, and we share a responsibility to see that they are properly funded and available to everyone. These are investments with high returns and low risks of corruption and appropriation. Furthermore, this proposal ties funding directly to results: if the commitment does not succeed, there is no cost to the sponsors. Every so often, an idea comes along that makes you ask: now why didn't I think of that? This is such an idea.

The Working Group chairs are deeply grateful to the members of the Advance Market Commit - ment Working Group, who spent two years exploring in detail whether and how an advanced market commitment could lead to faster development of desperately needed health products for the developing world. The Working Group brought diverse exper - tise and a unied commitment: to develop a practical proposal, one that would have the potential to transform the risk-benet calculus for industry, donors and developing countries. Working Group members are proled in appendix C. We would like to thank the many individuals who offered com - ments on this and earlier drafts of the report and the term sheets, coming from the pharmaceutical and biotech industry and academic, global public health, policy and investor communities. Those com - ments helped us think (and rethink) both the rationale and the elements of such a commitment; they challenged and enriched our understanding of the ways in which different types of funding are needed to support the steps on the way to effective\u2014and effectively delivered\u2014vaccines; and they contributed to a more complete con - ception of the benets and risks of purchase and price guarantees. (A list of individuals consulted appears in appendix D.) We are particularly grateful for the opportunity provided by Charles Clift to engage in an e-consultation under the auspices of the Commission on Intellectual Property Rights, Innovation and Public Health in November and December 2004. We appreciate the comments of participants at the October 2004 meeting of the International Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association; several Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immu - nization Financing Task Force meetings; the September 2003 malaria meeting in Mozambique; the 6th International Rotovirus Symposium in Mexico City in July 2004; and the March 2005 Malaria Vaccine Technology Roadmap meeting in Provence, France. None of those who commented are responsible in any way for the ultimate content of this report.We appreciate the time and encouragement of Melinda Moree and the staff of the Malaria Vaccine Initiative and Seth Berk - ley and the staff of the International AIDS Vaccine Initiative. Generous with their knowledge and candid with their critiques, these individuals have strengthened this work greatly, but bear no responsibility for its ultimate content. Several individuals made particularly important contributions to background analyses. We are indebted to Eyal Dvir, Rachel Glennerster, Jean Nahrae Niels Rosenquist, Georg Weizsacker and Heidi Williams. Their contributions are woven throughout this report. Gargee Ghosh, who served as project manager from May 2003 through July 2004, deserves much of the credit for the group's progress through to the October 2004 consultation draft of this report, which was widely circulated. We are grate - ful for her strong analysis, skillful management and helpful impatience. Nancy Birdsall and other colleagues at the Center for Global Development have provided useful comments and advice throughout. We thank the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation for nan - cial support for this work, and Raj Shah, Hannah Kettler, Gina Rabinovich, Rick Klausner and others at the Foundation for their active engagement throughout the project. Finally, we are profoundly indebted to John Hurvitz, a partner of Covington & Burling, where he is co-chair of the rm's Life Sciences Industry Group and chair of the rm's Technology Tran - sitions Group. Together with his colleagues Stuart Irvin and Kevin Fisher, John provided support of incomparable value throughout this project. He worked tirelessly under a pro bono arrangement to develop creative and practical solutions to thorny contractual problems, and effectively translated among the languages (and cultures) of law, business and public health. This generous con - tribution, provided out of a commitment to make the world a better place, is at the very heart of our report. CGD 0414.indd 9 4/14/05 1:31:46 PMMaking Markets for Vaccinesx Policy highlights Making a commitment in advance to buy vaccines if and when they are developed would create incentives for industry to increase investment in research and development (R&D). New commer - cial investment would complement funding of R&D by public and charitable bodies, accelerating the development of vital new vaccines for the developing world. This report takes the proposal from theory to practice by showing how a commitment can be consistent with ordinary legal and budgetary principles. A draft contract term sheet is included, highlighting the key elements of a credible guarantee. This generation can leave an historic legacy. By creating arrangements that spur the same scientic effort to diseases of the poor as we put into diseases of the rich, we can make a lasting contribution to the defeat of poverty. Let our legacy be the conquest of disease: Barely 10% of global R&D is devoted to diseases that affect 90% of the world's population. AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria kill about 5 million people each year, yet we have no effective vaccine for these diseases\u2014nor for others that primarily affect the poorest of the world's citizens. An advance market commitment would complement public and philanthropic funding of R&D and accelerate the develop - ment and availability of vaccines for diseases occurring mainly in the developing world. It would stimulate the allocation of commercial research funds to neglected diseases, and so har - ness the energy, experience and expertise of the private sector. Without a commitment, there will continue to be insufcient funding to bring more than a few, if any, candidate vaccines to market. Structured correctly, an advance market commitment could help to ensure both a reliable future supply of new vaccine prod - ucts and affordable prices over the long term. There are good examples\u2014discussed in chapter 2\u2014of where similar incentives have been effective; and the example of medicines for affluent countries demonstrates that, if the market is sufciently valu - able, there will be commercial investment in R&D. This commitment can be implemented in practice. It is based on sound and familiar legal principles that permit the rules\u2014price, eligibility criteria and dispute resolution procedures\u2014to be transparent and binding from the outset. The report includes draft contract term sheets that show how it can be done. For products at relatively early stages in their development, a commitment of $3 billion for each priority disease\u2014an amount that would be comparable with sales of medicines in rich countries\u2014would be a very good deal for the sponsors: a bargain compared with other development interventions, each life-year saved would cost less than $15. With appropriate contractual arrangements, the commitment would be applicable both to products at a late stage of devel - opment (such as vaccines against rotavirus and pneumococ - cus) and to products at an early stage (vaccines to prevent the transmission or mitigate the impact of malaria, HIV and tuberculosis). Both public and private philanthropic funders could make binding commitments within existing budgetary processes consistent with current regulatory and procurement systems for vaccines that would reach the poorest countries of the developing world. The commitment itself has no cost unless and until a vaccine is developed. It can be made without reducing the resources available to support health education and prevention, to buy existing vaccines and drugs, to strengthen health systems in developing countries or to fund R&D and public-private part - nerships. Funding for these high priority activities can, and should, be increased in the short term. These are important complements to increased commercial investment in R&D. Progress will be accelerated if we do more to buy existing vaccines. It is essential to boost and strengthen vaccination CGD 0414.indd 10 4/14/05 1:31:46 PMMaking Markets for Vaccinesxi delivery systems in developing countries, to improve demand forecasts and to extend long-term procurement for existing vaccines. These measures would save lives today\u2014and comple - ment an advance market commitment by making the market for vaccines larger and more certain. Scientic breakthroughs are by no means the answer to all the problems of poor countries. But they can play, and have played in the past, a major role in improving the health of those who have the least. Building on the achievements of the past, this generation of scientists could nd ways to prevent malaria and tuberculosis, stop the spread of HIV/AIDS and dramatically reduce the toll on children of diarrhoeal and respiratory disease. But such accomplishments are unlikely to happen without incentives that take such work out of the exclusive realm of altruism and charity, and place it squarely in the domain of functioning, sustainable markets, creating incentives for the private sector to bring the full weight of its experience and assets to bear. CGD 1:31:47 PM2 Summary: A legacy of our generationThis generation has a unique opportunity to leave a legacy of which we can be proud. Current and near-future scientic knowl - edge can be used to conquer diseases that kill millions of people each year and disable millions more. In the development of vac - cines, in particular, scientic breakthroughs have the potential to transform the health of the developing world much as they have been instrumental in almost eliminating the burden of life-threatening infectious disease among children in affluent nations. The most signicant challenges are ahead: we have not yet developed effective vaccines against diseases of the poor, such as malaria, HIV and tuberculosis. Governments and private foundations have made enormous strides in recent years toward establishing arrangements that will facilitate investment in R&D needed to develop new vaccines for these diseases. Now the resources and talent of the private sec - tor are needed to translate those investments, and the scientic breakthroughs they are producing, into new vaccines, which once developed would be manufactured in adequate quantity. Unfor - tunately, the absence of an adequate market for those vaccines makes it impossible for the private sector to make investments in these diseases on a commercially viable basis. We could make it worthwhile for the pharmaceutical industry to invest much more in R&D on vaccines for diseases occurring mainly in developing countries\u2014and in the mass production of those vaccines when they have been developed. This can be done simply and cheaply by ensuring that there is a market for the vaccines if and when they become available. Why vaccines: The unrealized potential of immunization Immunization has had a profound impact on global health, in rich countries as well as poor. Immunization is cheap, reliable and effective, and is reaching the majority of children in low-income countries. But we have not capitalized on the full potential that immunization offers. Many more lives in the developing world could be saved and improved with increased access to existing and new vaccines. First, we need to improve the availability of existing vaccines. That 3 million people die every year of diseases that can be pre - vented with existing vaccines is evidence of a profound failure in the current system. This failure can be remedied with more predictable nancial resources, stronger political commitment to public health, greater investment in both immunization-specic and broader elements of health systems and better management at all levels, global to local. Second, we need to accelerate the development of new vaccines targeted to and appropriate for the epidemiological conditions and health systems of developing countries. Part of the solution lies in establishing secure nancing for the medium term so that countries are willing to introduce vaccines that cost more than the \"pennies per dose\" that ministries of health (and donors) have come to expect. Another part of the solution is to ensure sufcient funding and the right incentives for innovation to develop new health technologies, both in the short and long term. Given the range of what is needed\u2014investment in basic science, conduct of clinical trials, development of new manufacturing capabilities for cutting-edge products and scaling up of manufacturing over the long term\u2014these incentives should be designed to attract investment by private rms of many types: biotechnology rms, multinational pharmaceutical companies and emerging suppliers, including in developing countries such as India. Intensive and growing efforts are being directed along many but not all of the necessary fronts: The Global Alliance on Vaccines and Immunization's (GAVI) recent investments in vaccines and strengthening health care systems, along with the long-standing efforts of national governments and international donors. The International Finance Facility for Immunization ini - tiative (IFFIm) and other efforts seeking to establish an adequate and predictable funding base. GAVI's Accelerated Development and Introduction Plans (ADIPs) to generate information for good decisionmaking about introducing new products. Increased funding for research on neglected diseases, for example through product development public-private part - nerships as well as traditional publicly funded research. These efforts are beginning to show results with improvements in immunization coverage and introduction of newer vaccines, as well as the accumulation of scientic knowledge and the development of promising new vaccine candidates. But one dimension of the problem has gone largely unaddressed by policymakers: the lack of market- based incentives for pharmaceutical companies to complement these existing efforts with the R&D necessary to move promising vaccine candidates from the lab through to scaled-up manufacturing. CGD 0414.indd 2 4/14/05 1:31:47 PM3 Summary: A legacy of our generation New medicines are a shared endeavor Developing a new vaccine or drug is expensive because of formi - dable scientic challenges and stringent regulatory requirements.1 Candidate medicines must be tested, rst in small and then in large trials. Regulatory approval must be obtained. Investment is needed in manufacturing and distribution capacity, meeting a high standard for safety and quality. Estimates of the total cost of developing a new medicine vary from hundreds of millions of dollars to well over $1 billion. For most medicines available today, this investment has been nanced by a mixture of public funding by government, philan - thropic and charitable giving and private investment. Firms make those investments in R&D with the expectation of being able to sell the nished product for a prot and so recover their investment. For health conditions that affect affluent countries, basic sci - entic development is the result of a mixture of publicly funded research in tandem with a more limited amount of commercial investment in basic science. The later stages of product develop - ment, including clinical trials, approval and manufacturing\u2014 stages that make up more than two-thirds of the total costs of developing new medicines\u2014are funded primarily by commercial pharmaceutical companies. While nearly all medicines depend to some extent on publicly funded science, the private sector is the single largest funder of medical R&D, and typically takes on the challenge of converting scientic advances into usable products. Those costs are then passed on to the consumers and governments, directly or through insurance. It is difcult to overstate the importance of commercial invest - ment in medicine. Market incentives are particularly effective in ensuring that R&D is targeted at strategies that will bring the best possible products to market as quickly as possible. A piece of the puzzle is missing Commercial biotech and pharmaceutical companies have to target their R&D on products that will produce a commercial return; this usually means medicines for the high-value markets of high-income countries. As things stand today, the markets for vaccines and drugs for diseases occurring mainly in developing countries are not valuable enough to offer sufcient returns to provide commercial justication for the necessary expensive research and product development. So for health conditions that primarily affect poor countries, there is little or no commercial investment to complement publicly nanced R&D. An estimated 10% of the world's R&D investment is in solutions for diseases that affect 90% of the world's people.2 Even where public investment results in promising scientic leads, limited resources mean that many of those leads languish in the laboratory, with insufcient resources and few champions to bring more than a few of them through to the next, more expensive stages of product development and clinical trials. Commercial investment would accelerate new medicines The prospects for R&D for products that would prevent or treat diseases concentrated in developing countries has been signicantly improved in recent years by the establishment of partnerships3 that, largely through funding from philanthropic foundations such as the Rockefeller Foundation and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foun - dation, have greatly increased the resources available to accelerate the development of medicines for developing countries. While these efforts have vastly enhanced the prospects for nding vaccines for these diseases, resources are still too small to fund the development of more than a small number of candidate medicines. Moreover, incentives for the full engagement of the private sector, which will be essential for efcient scale-up and manufacture, are not in place. The result is slow progress through clinical trials and the commercial development of new vaccines, and potentially a premature narrowing of the eld of candidates. Were it available, commercial funding would increase the number of products under development and accelerate clinical trials, and so raise the chances of success for second-generation products and a greater diversity of new vaccines. This is particularly important in the case of malaria and AIDS, where the rst-to-market vac - cine may be only partially efcacious, and there will be a strong need to push the science further. We can create incentives for commercial investment Incentives for commercial investment in R&D and manufacturing can be created through an advance market commitment, in which donors make a legally binding pledge to pay for a new vaccine, if and when one is developed (box 1).4 Such a commitment would create a larger and more certain market. It would imitate the market conditions that stimulate research for diseases common in developed countries. It would create incentives for more rms to CGD 0414.indd 3 4/14/05 1:31:48 PM4 Summary: A legacy of our generationidentify and pursue promising avenues of research and to compete to bring them to market as quickly as possible. It would attract rms to develop new products for these diseases. Such a commitment would enable donors to increase the incen - tives for commercial investment without reducing the resources available for immediate investment in R&D through public- private partnerships and other existing arrangements. Create a market not a prize The Center for Global Development Advance Market Com - mitment Working Group has designed an advance market commitment that would be practical and effective. It would cre - ate a market, not a prize, and so avoid some of the pitfalls of a \"winner-take-all\" mechanism. The main elements of our ndings are that: A legally binding commitment can be made within the conventional framework of existing contract law (we include draft contract term sheets to illustrate the arrangement). Government donors can make this commitment within existing budget processes; it would have no impact on pub - lic spending unless and until a vaccine is developed. Government and philanthropic investments in research and the creation of an advance market commitment are mutually reinforcing, collectively accelerating progress. A market of approximately $3 billion for each priority disease for which substantial R&D is needed would cre - ate revenues comparable in value with revenues that rms obtain for pharmaceutical products in affluent countries. For diseases that impose the largest health burden on devel - oping countries, the cost of vaccines under such a commit - ment would be outstanding value for money for donors, more cost-effective than almost any existing development assistance. Purchases under an advance market commit - ment for a malaria vaccine are roughly estimated to cost less than $15 life-year saved. Consistent with current thinking in development assistance and aid effectiveness, payments are linked to results. If a commitment is put in place and no vaccine is developed, there will be no nancial cost. If such a commitment suc - ceeds, millions of lives will be saved at very low cost. This would create a set of incentives comparable to those that exist for diseases of high-income countries. Firms would be likely to respond to a commitment by increas - ing investment in R&D and scaling up production capacity, thereby accelerating the development of new vaccines, increasing competition and fostering long-term affordability. Benets to developing countries, donors and industry Carefully designed advance market commitments can offer sub - stantial benets to donors, industry and\u2014most importantly\u2014 developing countries. For donors, this is a low-risk, transparent, Box 1 The main features of the proposed commitment An agreed technical specication\u2014in terms of outputs\u2014required of a new vaccine. A price guarantee, consisting of small payments from eligible countries and a co-payment by spon - sors, would apply to a maximum number of treat - ments. (For example, the price might be guaranteed at $15 per treatment, with the eligible low-income country paying $1 and sponsors topping up the pay - ment with an additional $14 for the rst 200 million treatments.) An overall market size of about $3 billion\u2014enough to make it worthwhile for rms to accelerate invest - ment in research and development for new vaccines, but well below the social value of the vaccine. An independent adjudication committee to oversee the arrangements and commitments enforceable under the law. In return for taking up the guaranteed price on the rst treatments sold, the producer would be obliged to commit to produce and sell further treatments in eligible countries at a xed, low sustainable price. Total sales of each qualifying product would depend on demand from developing countries. This in turn would depend on the effectiveness of the vaccine and the available alternatives. CGD 0414.indd 4 4/14/05 1:31:48 PM5 Summary: A legacy of our generation cost-effective investment that guarantees widespread access to vaccines if and when they are developed. In this results-oriented approach, there is a nancial cost to sponsors only if a vaccine is developed. In addition, the structure of these commitments guarantees that this would be a nancially sustainable donor investment. For industry, an advance market commitment cre - ates a risk-reward structure with which rms are already familiar: they will be rewarded if they bring to market a product for which there is real demand. Unlike many alternative proposals, access issues are addressed without weakening incentives or dismantling the system of intellectual property rights. Most important, for developing countries an advance market commitment is likely to signicantly accelerate the development and distribution of essential vaccines, of great value to sustainably improving the health of people in poor countries. The commitment ensures that, if a new vaccine is developed, it will be rapidly available in developing countries at an affordable price. Next steps We recommend that donors, industry and the public health com - munity work together to develop an advance market commitment for critical diseases occurring mainly in developing countries, including (but not necessarily limited to) HIV, tuberculosis and malaria. In doing this, we recommend further and more targeted analytic work by governments, industry and public health experts on several key topics. Priorities for further work include: Strengthening nancing for the purchase of existing vac - cines, and strengthening health systems in developing coun - tries to increase vaccine coverage. Developing long-term advance market commitments with producers of vaccines that will be available in the near future, using the commitment to negotiate on price, timing of supply and characteristics of the vaccines and their pre - sentation. For vaccines that are at an early stage: Considering the specic issues with respect to individual diseases (such as the likely demand from high-income and middle-income markets). Validating our estimates of the market size needed to induce private sector investment in R&D, using alternative datasets for market revenues. Working closely with industry and the public health com - munity to develop the contractual framework, including addressing the various design choices highlighted here. Developing technical specications for each product, in collaboration with developing country health specialists and the scientic community. Considering what adaptations, if any, should be made to mechanisms for funding R&D in the context of an advance market commitment. Considering how this approach might be extended to other diseases that affect the developing world, such as schis - tosomiasis or leishmaniasis, and for drugs and medical diagnostics. This report lays out the rationale for this approach. More important, it sets out a blueprint for implementation. We have been heartened and impressed by the speed of policy - makers in responding to the Consultation Draft of our report. Policy processes are now in place to establish a commitment for such diseases as malaria and HIV. We fully acknowledge that there is more work to be done, and that the Working Group's ideas will likely require modication as they are put into practice. We hope that this report will encourage the continuing discussion between donors, industry and the public health community in agreeing on the details of advance market commitments. CGD 0414.indd 5 4/14/05 1:31:49 PM1 We need vaccines CGD 0414.indd 6 4/14/05 1:31:49 PMChapter at a glance Vaccines represent the best hope for large, rapid and affordable improvements in health in the developing world. Vaccines developed for affluent countries have already contributed greatly to improving the health of people in poor countries. A remarkable 75% of children receive a basic set of childhood immunizations. But because of shortcomings in nancing and delivery, including delays in introduction of life-saving vaccines, more than 3 million people die each year of vaccine-preventable diseases. Increasingly, the main diseases in poor countries are not a high priority in affluent countries. As a result, developing countries can no longer depend on rich markets to meet the costs of the development of new vaccines that would benet poor countries. The total market size for vaccines in developing countries is tiny\u2014about $500 million a year. This is insufcient to provide an incentive for pharmaceutical companies to invest in developing new vaccines for these diseases. In addition to being small, the vaccine market is characterized by collective procurement. Success in stretching health budgets by keeping prices as low as possible has important short-term benets. But the aim of minimizing short-term costs to ensure access must be balanced with the goal of providing returns sufcient to stimulate development of new products. Largely as a result of the low value and high risks of the developing country market, less than 10% of global spending on health research and development is devoted to the major health problems of 90% of the population. Without a valuable market to stimulate the development of new vaccines for diseases that occur mainly in developing countries, alternative arrangements are needed to ensure that vaccines are developed, produced on a large scale and made available affordably and reliably to developing countries. CGD 0414.indd 7 4/14/05 1:31:49 PM8 We need to invest more in vaccines1Vaccines are important for global health The importance of the development of new vaccines for the most signicant health problems in the developing world can hardly be overstated. Well known as being among the most cost-effective health interventions, immunization can be cost-saving, by pre - venting diseases that would otherwise require expensive treatment. In general, vaccines are well suited to the needs of developing countries. They are a cheap way to save lives, requiring no costly screening, diagnosis or follow-up. Extraordinary scientic progress, coupled with effective deliv - ery strategies, has transformed health conditions in the past 50 years, in both rich and poor countries. In the industrial world, for example, basic childhood immunization has almost eliminated many diseases that once crippled, severely sickened or killed thousands of young children each year (gure 1.1).1 Those same vaccines\u2014originally developed for the United States and Europe\u2014have been used in the developing world, typically sold at low prices after manufacturing capacity had expanded. These low prices are possible because the developers of the vaccines have been able to earn a return on their investment from sales in affluent countries. As patent protection has come to an end, and the markets have become contestable, production volumes have increased and the prices charged to developing countries have fallen close to the marginal cost of production, a few cents. For example, the combined diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis (DTP) vaccine costs about $0.09 a dose, and the measles vaccine costs about $0.14 a dose. Even with lower levels of coverage than in developed countries, these products have had an enormous health impact in the devel - oping world. More than three-quarters of the world's children receive the basic childhood immunizations. Vaccines have transformed global health. Smallpox used to kill 5 million people a year; thanks to the world's rst vaccine, it was eradicated in 1979 (box 1.1). Fifty years ago, polio was the leading cause of paralysis, crippling thousands of children and adults. The eradication of polio through vaccination is tantaliz - ingly close, though it will require continuing focus and commit - ment from policymakers. Two-thirds of developing countries have eliminated neonatal tetanus. In one year alone (from June 2001) mass measles campaigns in eight African countries vaccinated more than 20 million children and prevented more than 140,000 deaths; measles vaccinations are now preventing 250,000 deaths Figure 1.1 Basic childhood immunizations reduce reported cases of disease in developed and developing countries\u2014selected examples Source: WHO Immunization Proles for Developed and Developing country groups. CGD 0414.indd 8 4/14/05 1:31:50 PM9 We need to invest more in vaccines1a year.2 As a result of both routine immunization programs and campaigns, millions of lives are saved every year; and millions more are protected from disease and disability. Millions die of vaccine-preventable diseases In many ways, it is extraordinary how effectively vaccines reach children all over the world. More than three-quarters of the world's children are vaccinated, and vaccines reach children in remote areas, overcoming formidable obstacles of geography, conflict and poverty. Even so, about 3 million people a year die of diseases that can be prevented with existing vaccines, such as measles, hepatitis B and tetanus. People die of vaccine-preventable diseases partly because approximately 25% of children, almost all of them in developing countries, do not receive a full set of immunizations (gure 1.2). And those who are immunized do not always get newer vaccines against some high-risk diseases because, though suitable vaccines exist, cost and other barriers have delayed their widespread introduction. Low-income countries have beneted from R&D investments made in response to the market in high- and middle-income countries; but vaccines developed for high-income markets have been introduced in developing countries only after a considerable delay\u2014typically 10-15 years or more (gure 1.3). For example, during the 1990s the use of a vaccine for Hib3 (a strain that causes some forms of pneumonia and meningitis) almost eliminated Hib-related diseases in high-income countries. But the vaccine remains too expensive for use in most low-income countries.4 As a result, an estimated 4.5 million unvaccinated children died from Hib-related diseases\u2014mainly pneumonia\u2014over the last decade (see gure 1.2).5 (Note that hepatitis B vaccination does Box 1.1 The eradication of smallpox An estimated 300 million people died from smallpox in the 20th century. As a result of a global effort, nanced in part by foreign aid, the disease has been eradicated. In the middle of the 20th century there were approximately 10-15 million cases of smallpox in more than 50 countries, and 1.5-2 million people died of the disease each year. Smallpox killed about a third of the people it infected. In 1965 international efforts to eradicate smallpox were revitalized by a new Smallpox Eradication Unit at the World Health Organization and a pledge for more technical and nancial support from the campaign's largest donor, the United States. Endemic countries were supplied with vaccines and kits for collecting and sending specimens, and vaccination was made easier by the provision of bifurcated needles. An intensied effort was led in the ve remaining countries in 1973, with the surveillance and containment of outbreaks. By 1977 the last endemic case of smallpox was recorded in Somalia. In May 1980, after two years of surveillance and searching, the World Health Assembly declared that smallpox was the rst disease in history to have been eradicated. The cost of the smallpox campaign between 1967 and 1979 was $23 million a year. International donors provided $98 million, while $200 million came from the affected countries.

More investment needed in vaccines for diseases concentrated in developing countries Over and above the experience of delayed introduction of new products, desperately needed new vaccines simply may not be developed at all. Today, the health needs of children in the poor - est countries are now quite different than those of children in Europe, Japan and the United States. Fifteen years ago, a child born almost anywhere in the world received more or less the same basic vaccines\u2014DTwP (diphtheria, tetanus and whole-cell pertussis [whooping cough]), OPV (oral polio vaccine) and BCG (tuberculosis). 6 Over time, however, as major childhood killers like measles were conquered in wealthy countries, new vaccines that are quite specic to rich-world con - ditions were developed. In some cases, vaccines were enhanced to decrease the (already very low) risks of adverse reactions. In general, these vaccines are costlier to produce. As a result of these changes, a child born in the rich world today receives different vaccines than a child in the developing world (gure 1.4). 7 The priority diseases for poor countries are not the main pri - orities for rich countries. AIDS is a leading cause of death in the low-income countries, but it is not even one of the top 10 kill - ers in high-income countries. Diarrhoeal diseases, malaria and other childhood diseases also appear on the developing world's top 10 causes of death, but are nowhere on the equivalent list for rich countries. Communicable diseases are the cause of 56% of the disease burden in low-income countries, and just 6% of the disease burden in high-income countries (table 1.1). The target product characteristics are also different: heat stability, safety and affordability continue to be major concerns for the developing world, while the developed world is driving toward very low risk vaccines even if this substantially adds to the cost. As the pharmaceutical industry has responded to the health needs of the world's better-off, diseases that are concentrated in the poorest populations have largely been neglected (see table 1.1). The spectrum of available vaccines, even if used comprehensively, would not solve the major health problems facing the developing world.

CGD 0414.indd 10 4/14/05 1:31:52 PM11 We need to invest more in vaccines1AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria account for about 5 million deaths a year; there is no effective vaccine for any of these three diseases, and the science for each is at an early stage. Pneumococcus is esti - mated to kill 1.1 million people a year, and rotavirus 0.8 million. For pneumococcus, vaccines are being developed, but they will need to be adapted to protect against the serotypes that account for the burden of disease in developing countries (box 1.3). Even once vaccines have been licensed for use, previous experience suggests that it will be many years before they are widely available at prices affordable to most developing countries. The form of the disease they protect against may not be the form that is most common in developing countries. Other diseases primarily affecting the devel - oping world for which no vaccines are available include shigella, schistosomiasis, leishmaniasis, chagas disease and dengue. 8 This means that the developing world's previous source of affordable vaccines\u2014residual supply from the developed world, at tiered prices\u2014is no longer a reliable model. When new prod - ucts are developed with the rich world\u2014not the poor\u2014in mind, diseases concentrated in the developing world are left behind. Not only would vaccines suitable for the developing world reduce the burden of disease, but it is generally believed that these health improvements would have substantial positive impacts on eco - nomic growth and poverty reduction (WHO 2003c) (box 1.2). Pharmaceutical development is a risky investment decision R&D-based pharmaceutical companies and biotechnology rms are in a risky business. Their business model is to place smart Table 1.1 Global burden of disease in 2002, disaggregated by cause CausePercent of total world disease burdenPercent of total disease burden in high- income countriesPercent of total disease burden in low- income countries Communicable, maternal and perinatal diseases41.0 6.2 56.4 Infectious and parasitic diseases23.9 2.5 34.1 HIV/AIDS 5.8 0.6 7.6 Tuberculosis 2.4 0.1 3.0 Malaria 3.0 0.0 4.9 Respiratory infections 6.1 1.2 8.4 Other 11.1 2.5 13.9 Noncommunicable conditions46.7 84.7 32.6 Malignant neoplasms (cancers)5.1 14.7 2.4 Cardiovascular diseases 9.9 15.3 7.3 Other 31.7 54.7 22.8 Injuries 12.2 9.1 11.0 Note: Figures are disability-adjusted life years (see chapter 5 for denition).

Source: WHO (2003c).Box 1.2 Public health and economic growth Public health matters because health measures offer the opportunity to save millions of lives and improve the quality of life for millions more. Many argue that improving health could also have a major impact on eco - nomic development, in part through a direct impact of increased life expectancy. Estimates are controversial, but one estimate by Jeffrey Sachs is that countries with intensive malaria grew 1.3% less per person a year; and that a 10% reduction in malaria was associ - ated with 0.3% a year higher growth.a A study of the United States found that more than half the growth of real income in the rst half of the 20th century was attributable to declining mortality.b In other words, reducing the burden of disease can make a direct con - tribution not only to achieving the health-related Mil - lennium Development Goals, but more generally to the lives and prosperity of the developing world. a.

Firms get their competitive edge from doing this well. Vaccine development can take 7-20 years for basic research, clinical test - ing, regulatory approval, production and distribution\u2014and at each of the stages, even the most promising candidates can fail to perform as hoped. The investment costs are high. Estimates of the total cost vary, depending in part on what is measured. The range is from several hundred million dollars to more than $1.5 billion. One often-cited study nds a cost of $802 million for a new medicine, up to the point of regulatory approval.9 One reason that these estimated costs are so high is that these investments are uncertain: of all the candidate products that enter development, only a small proportion will be successful, and far fewer will become \"blockbusters\" that earn a signicant return for the company. For vaccine companies to stay in business, each successful product has to recover not only the costs of its own design and development, but also the costs of the unsuccessful candidates. The development of new products is, in effect, the outcome of a series of bets placed on emerging scientic pathways, based on a hard-nosed analysis of the competitive landscape and some reasonable estimates of the eventual market size and willingness to pay. The companies that do this best undertake their own research and work in partnership with biotech companies, research scientists, academics and others. The nal product combines the Box 1.3 Pneumococcus Source: GAVI (2005a).The bacterium Streptococcus pneumoniae is the most common cause of severe pneumonia worldwide. It also causes meningitis, septicaemia and ear infections. Although estimates of its death toll are made dif - cult by various factors, the pneumococcus bacterium (Streptococcus pneumoniae) is thought to kill 1. 1 mil - lion people worldwide each year, most of them young children and infants. In developing countries as many as 1 in 10 deaths in young children is attributed to this infection. Al - though vaccines for adults and children ages two and older have been available for years, they have not been suitable for the babies and toddlers who are most vulnerable to the disease because the current vaccines do not stimulate an appropriate immune response. However, a new conjugate vaccine that is highly effective in infants has recently been approved for marketing by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the United States, and several more vaccines are in late stages of development. But it is unclear whether these will be as effective in developing country settings as they are in developed countries.Pneumococcal vaccines protect by stimulating an - tibodies against the specic polysaccharide (complex sugar) capsules that cover the bacteria. There are more than 80 specic pneumococcal capsular polysac - charides. The pneumococcal conjugate vaccine licensed by the FDA stimulates the production of protective antibodies against the seven serotypes that most fre - quently cause invasive disease in the United States. However, this \"7-valent\" vaccine does not stimulate antibodies against two serotypes, 1 and 5, which to - gether are thought to be responsible for 12%-25% of invasive pneumococcal disease in many developing countries. With such countries in mind, researchers and the vaccine industry have developed 9-valent and 11-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccines that stimulate an - tibodies against serotypes 1 and 5. These vaccines are the subject of large-scale eld trials in several countries in Africa, Asia and Latin America. Recom - mendations about the use of the new pneumococcal vaccines among infants in developing countries will depend on the results of these trials, the initial results of which have been spectacularly positive. CGD 0414.indd 12 4/14/05 1:31:53 PM13 We need to invest more in vaccines1scientic knowledge, innovation and intellectual property of a large number of partners. Despite these uncertainties, the market for medicines in the developed world succeeds in generating important new products. Effective and innovative drugs and vaccines are invented, tested, licensed and produced. The functioning of the market for affluent countries depends on patents and regulatory protection, which grant the manufacturer a temporary period of market exclusivity. This means that manufacturers are able to charge consumers a price high enough not only to cover the cost of production but also the costs of research and development. Market considerations play an important part in each stage of the process as possible medicines move from investment in basic research, through to clinical trials, licensing, production and supply (gure 1.5). By offering the opportunity to charge temporarily higher prices for the medicines, market exclusivity acts as a \"pull\" mechanism, providing pharmaceutical companies with sufcient incentive to make risky investments, some of which will eventually result in life-saving medicines of enormous social value. The small market for vaccines for developing countries The total market for vaccines for developing countries is about $500 million a year10 (gure 1.6), though it is growing as a result of increased spending through GAVI, which has spent some $530 million since it was launched in 2000.11 Total spending on health in the least developed countries averages $17 a person a year, of which about $6 a person is from the country's government budget. For slightly better- off low-income countries, the average is about $36 a person a year.12 (The equivalent gure for high-income countries is $2,263 a year.) Figure 1.5 Vaccine development pipeline CGD 0414.indd 13 4/14/05 1:31:54 PM14 We need to invest more in vaccines1The differentials in health spending are reflected in the vac - cine market. The global market for vaccines is about $6 billion a year\u2014accounting for only 1.5% of global pharmaceutical sales.13 Global sales of all vaccines combined are roughly equivalent to annual sales of a single blockbuster drug such as Lipitor or Prilosec.14 Developing-country markets account for about half the total vaccine sales by volume, but provide only about 5%\u2014or less\u2014of total revenues from vaccine sales. So developing-country vaccines currently make up a negligible proportion\u2014less than 0.1%\u2014of the value of pharmaceutical sales. Public procurement policies must balance long- and short-term interests From a commercial perspective, the arrangements that developing countries and development agencies use to buy medicines may compound the problem of an anemic market size. Most vac - cines are bought by public health authorities or on their behalf by the procurement divisions at agencies such as the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF). Once rms have sunk R&D resources on a vaccine, governments\u2014in the interests of protecting scarce health budgets\u2014have an incentive to use their role as dominant purchasers, regulators and arbiters of intellectual property rights to negotiate the lowest possible price. Given the very limited funds available for health, even with international donor support for immunization programs, achieving a low price is an essential way for these authorities to buy valuable health products for as many people as possible. But the short-term need to get vaccines to many people com - petes with the long-term need to ensure that rms can meet the costs of R&D and also provide returns to shareholders. This is particularly problematic when both developing-country governments and donor agencies have become accustomed to buying vaccines at \"pennies per dose.\" Buying vaccines at very low prices means that rms receive little more than the cost of production, not enough to recover the costs of the original R&D. Knowing in advance that buyers will want to push prices down in this way, it is difcult for rms to plan to invest in these products at all. Uncertainties in demand, in addition to the monopsony, increase the risks. International agencies' procurement arrange - ments typically do not bind the purchaser to buy the full number of doses for which tenders are issued. The quantity purchased may be much less than expected because of unforeseen calamities, volatility in the availability of donor or domestic funding, weak information systems and many other shortcomings in the ability to forecast demand. Given nonbinding contractual arrangements, the quantity risk lies entirely with the supplier. The need to reduce the lag time Pooled procurement and uncertain demand are not the only factors that create an unfavorable risk-reward prole. Increas - ingly, activists and public-policy makers are unwilling to accept long lag times between the availability of life-saving drugs in the rich countries and access to those products at prices afford - able to developing countries. The pressure on donors and rms to make antiretroviral drugs available to those with HIV/AIDS has brought this issue into sharp relief, but it is also the topic of active debate in the immunization eld. Pharmaceutical rms know when they are planning future research that, once a medicine is available, governments will wish to negotiate the price down and the company will come under pressure from public opinion to make important medicines avail - able as cheaply as possible. In extreme cases, the developer of an essential new medicine may face compulsory licensing. If the rm does not expect to be able to recover its development costs at the price it will able to charge, it will hesitate to invest in developing the medicine in the rst place. 15 As one senior industry executive Figure 1.6 Markets for vaccines are much smaller than those for pharmaceuticals Source: Batson (2001). CGD 0414.indd 14 4/14/05 to invest more in vaccines1said, \"Our worst nightmare would be to discover a vaccine for AIDS. We would be forced to give it away.\" With no valuable market, the prospects for the development of new vaccines to prevent or mitigate the severity of disease concentrated in low-income countries through innovation in the private sector are not promising. As we shall see in chapter 2, only 13 (1%) of the new chemical entities brought to market from 1975 to 1997 were specically for diseases of developing countries; and of these, only 4 were the direct results of R&D activities of the pharmaceutical industry targeted at new human products. 16 While there is some modest commercial investment, we are some way away from providing incentives that would engage the full resources and energy of the pharmaceutical and biotech rms in nding these solutions, which are essential to improving human health. CGD 0414.indd 15 4/14/05 1:31:55 PM2 Promoting CGD 0414.indd 16 4/14/05 1:31:56 PMChapter at a glance The development of a new medicine depends on the work of scientists based in academic, government and private research institutions, focusing on challenges that range from understanding a particular type of immune response to determining what type of packaging will maintain the viability of heat-sensitive products. Commercial investment is complemented in essential ways by public and philanthropic funding, which is especially important for the basic science and early-stage research on which pharmaceutical development depends. But the most expensive, later stages of vaccine development\u2014such as clinical testing, regulatory approval, production and distribution\u2014are mainly the result of private sector investment. For drugs and vaccines that are produced for populations in affluent countries, the single largest source of funding for R&D is commercial investment. 1 R&D on products that address health problems in developing countries receives neither the level nor the type of funding that health problems in developed countries receive. Of more than $100 billion spent on health R&D across the world, only about $6 billion is spent each year on diseases of developing countries, almost all of which is from public and philanthropic sources. There is little commercial investment because the market is not large enough to provide nancial returns to cover the costs. A number of different approaches can be used to make investments in neglected diseases more attractive\u2014and some have already been tried in a limited context and have demonstrated a positive effect. An advance market commitment would have important benets: First, it would mobilize additional resources, particularly for the clinical testing phases of development. Second, strong market incentives would mobilize the ingenuity, energy, intellectual assets and managerial capacity of the pharmaceutical sector\u2014from biotechs to multinational rms. Third, it would allow public sector and philanthropic funders to stand at arm's length from complex scientic choices and tradeoffs, allowing rms to make their own judgments about the scientic feasibility and risks of alternative strategies. Fourth, it would pay only for results, providing sponsors with the assurance that large-scale funding would be provided if and only if an effective and safe product that is appropriate for the developing world is manufactured in large enough quantity to meet demand. Finally, such an arrangement would speed up access to vaccines when they are developed, and would ensure long-term sustainable and affordable supply. CGD 0414.indd 17 4/14/05 1:31:56 PM18 Promoting private investment in vaccine development2Drug development depends on both public and private investment Bringing new drugs and vaccines to market is costly. For one drug to be approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), a rm typically screens 5,000-10,000 compounds. Of these, an average of 250 compounds survive preclinical testing, only 5 are approved for clinical testing, and only 1 succeeds in obtaining FDA approval. 2 Most of the R&D costs are concentrated in the clinical testing phases, and during the start-up of the manufacturing process. About 70% of R&D costs for a typical new medicine are incurred after clinical testing begins.3 Clinical trials for vaccines tend to be larger, and thus more expensive, than those for drugs, so the pro - portion of costs for clinical testing is likely to be even higher. For R&D on health conditions that affect affluent countries, a large share of the basic scientic research is funded by the public sector, while the greater part of clinical testing and drug development is nanced by private sector investments. Of the total investments in health R&D across the world (about $106 billion in 2001), governments provided about 44% of the total, the pharmaceutical industry about 48% and private, nonprot and university funds provided the remaining 8%. 4, 5 Public and philanthropic programs in industrialized countries are focused mainly on basic research About half of total global government funding for health research is nanced by the U.S. government. U.S. funding is channeled mainly through the National Institutes of Health (NIH), part of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. NIH invests more than $28 billion a year, with about 80% awarded to more than 200,000 researchers in universities, medical schools and other research institutions in the United States and around the world. About 10% of the NIH budget supports projects con - ducted by nearly 6,000 scientists in its own laboratories. A study of 21 drugs introduced between 1965 and 1992 and considered to have the highest therapeutic value found that public funding was instrumental in the development of 15 of them.6 NIH notes that the work that it funds is basic research, requiring exten - sive further development, and that development and production of an FDA-approved therapeutic drug occurs, on average, 8-12 years after the basic research has been completed. 7The private nonprot sector, including foundations, charities and universities, provided approximately $8 billion in 2002, about 8% of total global health R&D. Public investments are complemented by commercial private investments, when the promise of a market exists. Global invest - ment in health R&D by the for-prot sector was estimated at more than $50 billion in 2002, of which the U.S. pharmaceutical industry comprised about half. The trade association, PhRMA, estimates that the U.S. industry spent $34.4 billion on R&D in 2003. 8 However, denitions of R&D vary so this gure should simply be regarded as conrming the orders of magnitude, but not necessarily comparable to the overall gures. Private investment in health R&D is spent primarily on devel - oping products and turning promising candidates into drugs. A study by the National Science Foundation found that 18% of the U.S. pharmaceutical industry's spending on R&D is devoted to basic research; the other 82% toward applied research and product development.9 Other observers estimate that about 10% of industry investment is in basic research.10 The trade association puts the gure higher, which may again reflect differences in denition. It is difcult to overstate the importance of private sector investment in medicines. As well as providing the majority of the investment, the incentives are particularly effective at ensuring that research is targeted at the strategies that will bring the best possible products to market as quickly as possible. Decisions about where to allocate resources are made by those with the most at stake and the most direct knowledge of the prospects of scientic success, and investment decisions are based on a hard-headed analysis without political or bureaucratic influence. R&D funding for products for the developing world This picture of complementary private and public investment is quite different for R&D on products for primary use in the developing world. Overall, only a tiny proportion of total R&D addresses poor country health problems\u2014about $6 billion of a total of more than $100 billion annually; of that, less than $1 billion is devoted to vaccine research. The funding mechanisms also are markedly different: under current arrangements, progress toward drugs and vaccines for these diseases depends on public and philanthropic funding, largely through grants\u2014with about $1 billion from philanthropic sources and the CGD 0414.indd 18 4/14/05 1:31:56 PM19Promoting private investment in vaccine development2public sector. Very little is invested by commercial rms them - selves in products specic to health problems of developing coun - tries\u2014which is unsurprising given the small potential returns and the high risks associated with developing country markets. The total resources committed to developing vaccines against the three biggest global infectious diseases (HIV/AIDS, tuber - culosis and malaria) is less than $1 billion a year, compared with about $100 billion spent on diseases of rich countries. This dis - parity is reflected in the number and type of drugs that make it to market: among 1,223 new chemical entities brought to market from 1975 to 1997, only 13 (1%) were specically for tropical diseases; of these, only 4 were the direct results of research and development activities of the pharmaceutical industry targeted at new human products. 11 Both empirical evidence and theory tell us that commercial investment in R&D is strongly influenced by the size of the expected market. In one study an increase of 1% in the potential market size for a drug category led to a 4-6% increase in the number of new drugs in that category.12 Despite the lack of commercial incentives, some pharmaceu - tical companies are investing in the development of vaccines to prevent rotavirus, malaria, HIV and the forms of pneumococ - cus prevalent in many poor countries. But these efforts, while very welcome, are modest relative to the size of problem and the amount of investment needed. To accelerate progress toward these vaccines, it is necessary to move beyond investments motivated primarily by corporate social responsibility, toward a model in which these investments can become part of the mainstream com - mercial business, driven by the same incentives and commercial imperatives as products for affluent markets. Product development partnerships A large share of R&D philanthropic spending since the mid- 1990s has been channeled through about 20 product development public-private partnerships (PDPPPs), which were established to provide direct support for basic research and clinical trials in particular disease areas. Both the Rockefeller Foundation and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation have been instrumental in the development of the PDPPP concept and its implementation. While ad hoc collaboration between pharmaceutical companies and public sector bodies had previously existed around individual candidate projects, there were no systematic attempts to promote the parallel development of a portfolio of candidate products\u2014as the PDPPPs now attempt to do. Some PDPPPs are relatively new, with small portfolios; the older ones, with seven or more years' experience, manage sizeable portfolios, in some cases more than 25 products (box 2.1). For vaccines, the main PDPPPs include the Malaria Vac - cine Initiative (MVI), the International AIDS Vaccine Ini - tiative (IAVI) and the Aeras Global TB Fund (Aeras). The majority of the funding for PDPPPs comes from philanthropic foundations\u2014again, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation is the biggest contributor. MVI, founded in 1999, has spent more than $43 million on malaria vaccine R&D and now supports 20 vaccine candi - dates in various stages of preclinical or clinical development. This is about 15% of total noncommercial malaria vaccine R&D expenditures from 1999 to 2003. NIH (specically, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, or NIAID) accounts Box 2.1 Examples of product development public-private partnerships HIV/AIDS International AIDS Vaccine Initiative (IAVI) South African AIDS Vaccine Initiative (SAAVI) Global Microbicide Project (GMP) International Partnership for Microbicides (IPM) Microbicide Development Project (MDP) Malaria Medicines for Malaria Venture (MMV) Malaria Vaccine Initiative (MVI) European Malaria Vaccine Initiative (EMVI) Tuberculosis Global Alliance for Tuberculosis Drug Development Aeras Global TB Vaccine Foundation Foundation for Innovative New Diagnostics Other Drugs for Neglected Diseases Initiative (DNDi) Institute for OneWorld Health (IOWH) Pediatric Dengue PM20 Promoting private investment in vaccine development2for more than 50% of total funding; other funders include the European Community, the World Health Organization's (WHO) Special Programme for Research and Training in Tropical Dis - eases (TDR), the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) and the U.S. Department of Defense.13 MVI works through targeted partnerships with scientists, vaccinologists and development projects, and seeks to link government, industry and academic partners with eld trial sites in malaria-endemic countries as early as feasible in the development process. Increas - ingly, MVI is recognizing the importance of working during the R&D phase to support the development of nancing and introduction strategies. A slightly different model has been used by IAVI, which was founded in 1996. IAVI is focused mainly on providing nancial and technical support for product development\u2014according to IAVI's strategic plan, it will use 75% of its budget ($340 million donated to date) to support promising vaccine candidates. IAVI currently has 20 preclinical vaccines, 5 Phase I vaccines and 1 Phase II vaccine in its portfolio. 14 The Aeras Global TB Foundation received a grant of $82.9 million from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation in February 2004 to support research of promising tuberculosis vaccines in three main areas: clinical trials of two promising vaccine candi - dates, improving the effectiveness of animal models to indicate efcacy in humans and basic research on early-stage \"next gen - eration\" candidates.15 These and other PDPPPs are not resourced to take a portfolio of vaccine candidates through late stage clinical trials and com - mercial development. Even to meet their existing mandate\u2014that is, not including commercial product development\u2014they are estimated to need an additional $1-2 billion over the coming two to three years.16 The roles of public and private investment: the malaria example Despite the best efforts by PDPPPs, the small volume of resources for R&D and the absence of dynamic commercial investment have serious negative consequences for progress toward good\u2014and then better\u2014products for the world's most serious health conditions. Consider R&D for a malaria vaccine. Total global funding of R&D for a malaria vaccine in recent years has been about $65 million annually; in addition to this, MVI recently received a $100 million grant from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. This funding has enabled several candidate vaccines to move from the lab to clinical trials. So far, the scientic results are promising. This level of funding\u2014remarkably generous in comparison with what was previously available\u2014represents only a fraction of the likely costs of getting a product to market. The lowest estimates of the costs of pharmaceutical development predict a total of at least $300 million per new medicine; the most widely used estimate is $802 million (in 2000 dollars).17 Even at the lower estimates, pursuing a single candidate vaccine through the remaining phases of clinical trials, regulatory approval and pro - duction would exceed the total public and philanthropic funds presently available for the development of a malaria vaccine. Using any plausible scenario for public and philanthropic nancing alone, the available funds might allow at most one can - didate to be pursued through large trials to licensure. If MVI has to bet all its available funding on a single candidate, this would eliminate its ability to fund other prospects. So there would be no fallback if the lead candidate does not succeed\u2014or has unfore - seen adverse effects. There would be no competitive pressure to improve the efcacy or reduce costs, and no prospect of second-generation products following behind. 18 Even if funding were increased to allow a limited set of clini - cal trials, and if these trials demonstrate high levels of safety and efcacy, there are no guarantees that the product would be commercialized or produced in sufcient volume to support rapid uptake. The lead time for development of signicant manufactur - ing capacity, which is beyond the scope of any public or philan - thropic program, can be up to six years, and this investment is very costly and risky. \"Right now, the markets don't justify the risk, from a pharmaceutical company's perspective,\" according to Melinda Moree, Director of Malaria Vaccine Initiative, PATH. \"We have to nd ways to make this work for both the private and public sector. If the market is not there, the products won't be there. Getting the incentives right could make the difference.\" With the right market incentives, pharmaceutical companies have the experience, cost advantage and structure that would enable them to test and develop scientic leads and progress them as rapidly as possible through the development pipeline. An effective vaccine against malaria would be of enormous social value. Malaria is one of the world's biggest killers of CGD 0414.indd 20 4/14/05 1:31:57 PM21Promoting private investment in vaccine development2children, and through the Expanded Programme on Immuniza - tion (EPI) we have a proven and effective mechanism to deliver vaccines to children. But as things stand, the likely revenues to industry from developing a vaccine remain small. Governments in Sub-Saharan Africa cannot afford large increases in health spending. While donors might be willing to pay for life-saving products, at least for a time, a rational rm would discount that market heavily because of the downward pressure that donors collectively place on pharmaceutical prices. Possible incentives for commercial investment To understand better the potential for altering the behavior of pharmaceutical rms through the use of targeted incentives, we looked at several examples of how policies have affected private sector R&D activities: the U.S. Orphan Drug Act, procure - ment of meningitis C vaccine in the United Kingdom, incentives generated by government procurement guidelines, the Bioshield legislation in the United States and increasing the nancing for existing products, with enhanced forecasting of demand. U.S. Orphan Drug Act The U.S. Orphan Drug Act of 1983 uses market exclusivity and other mechanisms to enhance the market and thereby stimulate R&D on products for diseases that are rare in the United States (dened as those that afflict fewer than 200,000 Americans). 19 The Orphan Drug Act provides the following incentives: Seven years' marketing exclusivity on FDA approval (the FDA cannot approve the \"same\" drug for the same orphan indication without the sponsor's consent for seven years). If a drug demonstrates clinical superiority, the new drug can then be authorized for the same orphan disease. Tax credit for related clinical research, up to 50% of clini - cal testing expenses. Grant support for investigation of rare disease treatment. The act has increased R&D. According to the FDA, more than 200 drugs and biological products for rare diseases have been brought to market since 1983, up from fewer than 10 in the previous decade. 20 Of these, only 8 preventive vaccines have been designated. The main feature that makes the act attractive to pharmaceutical companies is believed to be the promise of a period of market exclusivity. 21Advance contracts for meningitis C vaccine in the United Kingdom The establishment of a more certain and commercially attractive market in the United Kingdom stimulated the development of a meningitis C vaccine. In 1994 ofcials in the U.K. Department of Health noticed an increase in the notications and laboratory-conrmed cases of meningococcal disease. While some of the increase was the result of improvements in reporting, there had also been a dispropor - tionate increase in group C cases, particularly for older teenagers. The department conducted talks with all major pharmaceutical manufacturers to understand the status of research on a vaccine for meningitis C. These talks revealed that a product was in the early stages of development. In 1996 the United Kingdom announced that a tender would be issued for a meningitis conjugate vaccine, and a tender for 18 million doses of vaccine was duly issued in 1999. Three companies responded to the tender and negotiations were conducted with each company separately. Clinical trial support and help by way of expedited regulatory reviews shortened the time to market for the companies in the United Kingdom and through the mutual recognition process in other European countries. The guaran - teed purchase was negotiated with each company participating in the tender; the rst to market would receive the lion's share of the purchase. The rst vaccine was licensed in October 1999 by Wyeth Lederle, which received a contract for approximately 10 million doses. This was followed by contracts for Chiron (5 million doses) and Baxter (3 million doses) in March and July 2000. The price was about $21 a dose. In subsequent tenders, in which only the annual birth cohort was vaccinated (approxi - mately 240,000 births at three doses per infant), prices fell substantially and fluctuated at around $12-18 a dose. The combination of accelerated approval and guaranteed purchase brought forward the development of a conjugate meningococ - cal vaccine.22 Incentives generated by government procurement guidelines Vaccines for Children (VFC), a U.S. government program estab - lished in 1994, provides vaccines to needy children free of charge. The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), CGD 0414.indd 21 4/14/05 1:31:57 PM22 Promoting private investment in vaccine development2experts selected by the Department of Health and Human Ser - vices, makes recommendations on vaccines to be administered in the United States. In practice, the recommendations typically set policy for immunization requirements and determine which vaccines will be available under VFC. Hence, if a vaccine is recom - mended by ACIP, producers of that vaccine are assured a reason - ably large market. Vaccine prices are typically negotiated after the ACIP recommendation, so once it has issued a recommendation, a vaccine producer is in a strong position to set the price close to the vaccine's social value. In this way the ACIP system shares some of the characteristics of an advance market commitment. Similarly, the private response to the 1993 Medicare policy to cover influenza vaccinations without co-payments or deductibles, which substantially enlarged the expected market for flu vaccines, offers evidence that policies can induce R&D in the private sec - tor.23 The best flu vaccines in existence at the time the policy was put in place had an efcacy rate of 58%, and the 1993 flu policy helped stimulate the research responsible for the approval (in 2003) of the rst new flu vaccines since 1978, as well as the rst intranasal flu vaccine, FluMist, which has an 85% efcacy rate in healthy adults. The annual potential benets from the 1993 flu policy (in particular, the combination of greater efcacy and wider use of the new vaccine) were estimated to range from $4.3-9.5 billion. 24 Project Bioshield I and II Project Bioshield legislation uses market enhancement mecha - nisms to stimulate development of bioterror countermeasures for 57 diagnostics, vaccines and therapeutic products prioritized by the Defense Science Board in the United States. Enacted in 2003, Bioshield provided for: Spending authority of nearly $6 billion for the procurement of qualifying countermeasures available in ve years.25 Greater authority of NIH and NIAID to award R&D grants and contracts and to hire technical experts. FDA emergency-use authorization\u2014for example, to waive licensing requirements if a product is needed in an emer - gency where alternatives are not available. A feature of the original design of Project Bioshield is that it established spending authority generally without committing to a particular price for the product. This reduces the certainty of returns to the producer: once a product has been developed, the U.S. government would still have an incentive to bargain for a low price. Moreover, the budgetary authority expires after ve years, even though it is likely to take longer to develop new products. Accordingly, the reaction of industry has been mixed. In interviews with pharmaceutical and biotech companies the Working Group found support for the need for explicit market creation, but also a widespread feeling that the proposals in the legislation had not gone far enough to achieve this Congress is now considering a further piece of legislation, Project Bioshield II, to create incentives to encourage research including in infectious diseases, which could include tax credits, intellectual property incentives, \"wild card\" patents (allowing companies to recover their R&D costs by extending the patent on a different product) and liability protection Enhancing incentives by demonstrating demand One way to increase rms' assessment of the likely returns on investment in future products is to buy larger quantities of prod - ucts that are available today. The existence of GAVI and the Vac - cine Fund, which have pledges in excess of $1.3 billion for the purchase and delivery of existing vaccines, may encourage some manufacturers to look again at developing-country markets. The International Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers and Associations (IFPMA) has said, \"This global initiative...has led to signicant improvements in nancing higher levels of immuni - zation in developing countries, making the development of new vaccines for developing countries feasible.\" 26 Options for nancing R&D for neglected diseases of developing countries The question of how to provide incentives for R&D on developing-country drugs and vaccines has intrigued econo - mists, public-policy specialists, public health experts and others for a long time, and has taken on an increasing intensity in the debates about the best way to use donor resources in the ght against AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria. Table 2.1 provides a thumbnail sketch of various approaches that have been suggested, along with their advantages and risks. Of the \"pull\" proposals, an advance market commitment has the advantage that it simultaneously meets the goals of creating effective incentives for commercial investment in R&D, ensuring CGD 0414.indd 22 4/14/05 1:31:58 PM23Promoting private investment in vaccine development2Approach Description Advantages Risks and challenges Advance market commitmentSponsor promises to fully or partially fund purchases of vaccines meeting specied conditions. Creates link between product quality and the revenues that accrue to a developer. Creates market for improved vaccines and progress. Ensures access to new vaccines in both the short and long run. Requires sponsors to pay only if a desired product is developed. Promises must be credible. Must be designed to cover appropriate products. Requires explicit nancial commitment. Patent buyouts Sponsor offers to buy patent rights to a vaccine meeting specied conditions, then puts the patent in the public domain and encourages competition in manufacturing the vaccine. Allows competition among manufacturers. May reduce prices and thus increase access. Promises must be credible. Must be designed to cover appropriate products. Manufacturer may have effective monopoly. Uncertain link between payments and product quality. Likely to be winner-takes-all. Strengthened intellectual property right (IPR) protectionPublic sector makes stronger commitment to enforce or extend IPRs (similar to Orphan Drug Act's guaranteed market exclusivity). Provides some additional incentive for industry. Difcult to implement. Higher prices for longer will impede access. May be politically unpopular. Provides very little incentive for R&D on products specic to poor countries. Sales tax credits Government offers a tax credit on vaccine sales. Provides some additional incentive for industry to invest. Only of benet to those with a tax liability (unless credits are transferable). Must be credible; no recourse to legal challenge for changes in tax law. Difcult to coordinate internationally. Prizes Offers cash or other reward to whoever achieves a certain, pre-specied goal. Provides immediate upfront payment\u2014no need for long-term contract. Industry may not be enthusiastic about competing for prizes. Does not address access. Winner takes all. Does not foster competition for subsequent improvements.Table 2.1 Possible incentives for commercial investment (continued on next page) CGD 0414.indd 23 4/14/05 1:31:58 PM24 Promoting private investment in vaccine development2Approach Description Advantages Risks and challenges Prizes based on incremental benets aInnovators are rewarded based on the incremental therapeutic benets; plus compulsory licensing. Solves access problem. Reduces wasteful duplication. Applies to wide range of diseases. Difculty of fairly determining social value after products have been developed. May be insufcient to foster competition for subsequent innovation. Uncertainty of value may deter investment. Best entry tournamentsOffers cash or other reward to whoever progresses farthest toward a specic research goal by a given date. Provides assurance that reward will be paid. May have to pay without getting result. Does not address access. Patent extensions on existing pharmaceuticals (\"wildcard patents\")Gives a manufacturer the right to extend the patent on any product in an industrial market, or allows a manufacturer to extend the customary time period that a patent is protected. Is attractive to larger pharmaceutical companies. Favors big companies and those with existing patents (unless patent extensions are transferable). Places cost of developing new vaccines on users of drugs whose patent is extended. Winner takes all\u2014does not foster competition for subsequent improvements. R&D treaty bAn international R&D treaty under which each signatory promises to devote a minimum fraction of its GDP to drug research through diverse mechanisms. Spreads R&D costs internationally. Is consistent with different intellectual property regimes. Free-rider problem: individual countries may channel subsidies to within-country rms and universities rather than to fund R&D on usable products suitable for poor countries. Does not directly address access. Virtual pharma A drug development strategy in which a small management team acquires and monitors most of its R&D services from outside vendors. Coordinates research. Prevents unnecessary duplication. Encourages information sharing. Lack of competition for innovation. Funders may not be best-placed to choose which research strategies to pursue. Absence of strong managerial incentives may lead to bureaucracy. Does not take advantage of R&D cost advantage of pharmaceutical industry.

It is this approach that the Center for Global Develop - ment's Advance Market Commitment Working Group examined in detail. The potential benets of an advance market commitment An advance market commitment, in which suppliers of vaccines that meet established technical specications are guaranteed a price that provides the potential for a viable return on invest - ment, closely mimics for the developing world the type of market incentives that exist in the developed world. In principle, such an arrangement could have important benets: It would mobilize additional resources, particularly for the clinical testing phases of development. Despite generous funding by foundations, within current budget envelopes most of the product development public-private partner - ships and other \"push\" programs that are engaged in drug and vaccine development for the developing world do not have sufcient resources to bring products through the full R&D process. As noted earlier in the case of malaria, with - out signicant commercial investment it is not clear how multiple candidate vaccines will be moved through clinical testing and, potentially, into large-scale manufacture. It would engage the dynamism and energy of the commer - cial pharmaceutical sector\u2014from biotechs to multinational rms. It would mean that decisions about which avenues to pursue, and which to abandon, would be put in the hands of those with the biggest stake and with the most knowledge about the prospects for success. It would harness the incentives and managerial capacity of the industry to develop new vaccines rapidly. It would thereby reproduce for developing-country diseases the market-based incen - tives that, together with public and philanthropic funding of R&D, have contributed to tremendous innovation in medicines for affluent countries, rewarding rms that move fastest toward the objective of developing and producing good products.Approach Description Advantages Risks and challenges Limiting patent protection in poor countries cAllowing patent protection in rich markets coupled with unrestricted competition by generics manufacturers in poor countries. Ensures increased access with little loss to pharmaceutical industry. Is cheap to implement. Is not intended to address problem of neglected diseases, but rather on medicines for which markets exist in high-income countries. Fast-track regulatory approvalRewarding pharmaceutical companies for developing vaccines for low-income countries by fast-tracking regulatory approval for them or for other, more protable medicines. Benets to pharmaceutical companies at little cost. Complements other approaches. Reward insufciently large and insufciently certain. If regulatory approval is being unnecessarily delayed, it should be accelerated anyway. Note: This table draws on Glass, Batson and Levine (2001) and Kremer and Glennerster (2004), with additions. a.

By clearly dening the objectives they wish to achieve with public funds, the sponsors can create conditions in which a variety of different approaches can be tried, not all of which may command a scientic consensus at the outset, promote competition and allow different rms to make their own judgments about the scientic feasibility and risks of alternative strategies. It would pay for results, providing sponsors with the assur - ance that large-scale funding would be provided if and only if an effective and safe product that is appropriate for the developing world is manufactured in large enough quan - tity to meet demand. This is consistent with innovations in development assistance, in which donors seek to pay for results rather than inputs. It would make the most of the untapped asset of infor - mation. By informing potential developers and suppliers about how much they would be willing to pay, and then locking it in, donors provide the type of signal that can, quite literally, be turned into capital. Properly designed, it would ensure access by helping to purchase vaccines in the short run and by ensuring a sus - tainable supply at an affordable price in the long run There is widespread agreement that more must be done to accelerate progress toward new vaccines and other products for the developing world. Similarly, there is broad appreciation of the value of engaging the talent, resources and hard-nosed business sense of the private sector in developing and pursuing promis - ing scientic pathways, and creating efcient manufacturing processes. From a conceptual perspective, providing an advance market commitment is appealing: it builds on the best aspects of markets, deploying public resources responsibly to stimulate private innovation. But could it work? Would it work? What would be the potential costs and benets? The ndings of the Working Group on these questions are presented in the chapters that follow. CGD 0414.indd 28 4/14/05 1:32:00 PMChapter at a glance The idea of making an advance purchase commitment has been discussed for several years, but the details of how it could be implemented have not been worked out. Our Working Group was established to determine whether a commitment could be designed that could be implemented and that would be effective and good value for money. We propose a framework for an advance market commitment that would bring new impetus to R&D in vaccines for diseases occurring mainly in developing countries. The arrangements are intended to create a market analogous to the market for medicines in affluent countries. Our proposal is for a market not a prize. There is no winner-take-all. By underwriting the purchase of vaccines, donors create incentives for rms to compete to bring products to market quickly. Better products can compete for market share, as they can in affluent markets. Advance market commitments would accelerate the production and availability of late stage products (rotavirus and pneumococcus vaccines) as well as the R&D and availability of early stage products (vaccines for malaria, HIV, tuberculosis). We have set out a quantied example for a malaria vaccine. A market worth $3 billion would create incentives for commercial investment to accelerate R&D, and the purchase of the vaccines at $15 per dose for the rst 200 million people would provide remarkable value for money for donors\u2014less than $15 per life-year saved. The commitment has been designed to meet the needs of all stakeholders. It would be of signicant benet to donors, industry and most of all the people in developing countries. An advance market commitment would ll an important gap in our arrangements for R&D for global health challenges. But our enthusiasm for it does not diminish the importance we attach to a range of other measures that we can and should take in the near term to save lives immediately and to enhance the prospect of developing new medicines that are essential for developing countries. CGD 0414.indd 29 4/14/05 1:32:00 PM30 A market not a prize3A practical advance market commitment We have developed a new proposal for an advance market com - mitment that responds to the needs of donors, industry and the public health community. Unlike some alternative \"pull\" propos - als, as summarized in chapter 2, this commitment does not cre - ate a prize to reward R&D.1 Instead it creates a market, broadly reproducing the market incentives to develop medicines for afflu - ent countries (box 3.1). We worked with experts in public policy, law, economics, health and scientic research, and we consulted potential sponsors and rms in the pharmaceutical and biotech sectors, in developed countries and in India. Our aim has been to determine whether it would be possible, in practice, for sponsors to make a commitment that would be effective in accelerating the development of new vaccines. The advance market commitment proposed here aims to mimic the size and certainty of a market for medicines in afflu - ent countries, and so create similar incentives for commercial investment in R&D. As well as accelerating the development of new vaccines, this approach would create incentives for rapid, large-scale production and provide the funds needed to buy the vaccines when they are available. We conclude that an advance market commitment is indeed practical and that it would be effective. This chapter outlines the main features of how a commitment could work, summarizing the implications for the main stakeholders. The rest of the report considers the design of the commitment and its likely impact in more detail. Commitments for late-stage and early- stage products The idea of an advance market commitment is this: because the potential market is made more valuable and more certain, rms will make investment decisions that accelerate the development of products for developing countries and invest in manufacturing capacity to produce larger volumes. This analysis applies both to late-stage products (those in the nal stages of regulatory approval and for which manufacturing capacity is being established, such as rotavirus vaccine) and to early-stage products (those requiring scientic progress and extensive testing of candidate medicines, such as malaria or HIV vaccines). The impact of an advance market commitment for late-stage products The rationale for using an advance market commitment for late- stage products is that, even after a product has proven successful in clinical trials, the low and uncertain value of demand from developing countries continues to affect the rm's investment decisions, which will determine the speed, volume and price of making the vaccine available. The rm's decisions that will be affected by market prospects include: Whether and how quickly to conduct clinical trials in developing countries.2Box 3.1 The main features of the commitment A technical specication\u2014in terms of outputs\u2014 required of a new vaccine. A minimum price guarantee, available up to a xed number of treatments. Guaranteed co-payments on products meeting the specication, paid by sponsors, permitting eligible countries to buy vaccines at affordable prices, for a maximum number of treatments. (For example, the price might be xed at $15 per treatment, with the developing country perhaps paying $1 and the spon - sors paying $14, for up to 200 million treatments). An overall market size of about $3 billion\u2014enough to make it worthwhile for rms with scientic op - portunities to undertake research and development, but well below the social value of the vaccine. An independent adjudication committee to oversee the arrangements and commitments enforceable under the law. An obligation on the producer to produce and sell further treatments in eligible countries at a xed, affordable price, in return for having had the advan - tage of sales at the initial higher price. Total sales of each qualifying product would depend on demand from developing countries. This in turn would depend on the effectiveness of the vaccine and the alternatives available. CGD 0414.indd 30 4/14/05 1:32:00 PM31 A market not a prize3 Whether to make a version of the product with the speci - cation and presentation suitable for developing countries. The speed of obtaining regulatory approval for developing countries. Whether enough production capacity is put in place for large-volume, low-unit-cost production. The price of the product in developing countries. Each of these decisions is critically affected by the prospects for future demand from developing countries, by the predict - ability of that demand and by the price the rm expects for sales to those markets. Experience has shown that, in the absence of reliable demand for developing-country markets, rms prefer to focus rst on producing new vaccines in low volumes and selling them mainly into high-value, developed-country markets. When high-value market needs have been met, and as the competition from lower cost generics producers becomes more likely, produc - ers move toward the high-volume, low-cost production needed for the developing world. Using an advance market commitment for late-stage prod - ucts would: Accelerate the availability of new vaccines in large quantities and at low prices, adapted as necessary for use in develop - ing countries, creating a virtuous circle (gure 3.1). Accelerate uptake of new vaccines by guaranteeing an afford - able long-term price once the commitment is exhausted. Ensure affordable access for people who need vaccines. Add to the credibility of the commitment for early- stage products and so accelerate the development of new vaccines. The impact of an advance market commitment for early-stage products Firms cannot make substantial investments in R&D if the mar - ket for the nal product is expected to be small and risky. The pharmaceutical industry has to decide where to invest its resources based on its expectation of success and its estimate of the value of the market. As long as the market for vaccines for developing countries remains small, there is little incentive for commercial investment in vaccines for diseases concentrated in developing countries. The case for an advance market commitment for early- stage products is that it would create an expected return from developing-country markets large enough for some pharma - ceutical rms to increase their investment in R&D in these products. In practice, pharmaceutical companies invest in R&D through a combination of work in their own laboratories, contract research, licensing intellectual property from others and acquiring or enter - ing joint ventures with other pharmaceutical and biotech com - panies. These investments are made by the company on the basis of the long-term expected returns from market sales of a new product. Both empirical evidence and theory tell us that com - mercial investment in R&D is strongly influenced by the size of the expected market. In one study an increase of 1% in the potential market size for a drug category led to a 4-6% increase in the number of new drugs in that category. 3 If an advance market commitment creates incentives for phar - maceutical companies to invest in R&D, those companies will in turn create a range of more immediate incentives within the R&D community. The market value of discoveries relating to global health issues will rise. More research contracts will be signed. Venture capitalists will increase investment in biotechs. In this way, the incentive created by the establishment of a nal market will \"reach back\" to create more immediate incentives for the intermediate research outputs required. Biotech companies Figure 3.1 A virtuous circle of demand, capacity and price CGD 0414.indd 31 4/14/05 1:32:01 PM32 A market not a prize3and their investors will not have to invest on the basis of returns that are likely to take 10 or more years to materialize. If they are successful, they can expect to license their products to phar - maceutical companies much faster than that. The basis for our expectation that this will work in practice is that this is precisely how collaboration on R&D on products for affluent markets works. There may be room for improvement in the way these contracts are created. But the functioning of these markets gives us good reason to believe that a healthy market for intermediate outputs would follow from a suitable advance market commit - ment for the end product. In addition to creating incentives for R&D, an early-stage advance market commitment would have the same benets as a late-stage advance market commitment in that it would create incentives for high-volume, low-unit-cost production and ensure nancing for access to these vaccines. Design differences between early-stage and late-stage commitments The main difference between the design of an early-stage com - mitment and a late-stage commitment is that the contract for late-stage products would likely be with specic named suppliers while the contract for early-stage products would initially be an open framework agreement, with rms competing for the right to benet from the guaranteed price in the second contract. We set out below examples of how an advance market com - mitment could work for malaria (an early-stage product) and pneumococcus or rotavirus (late-stage products). These exam - ples were developed to focus and discipline the thinking of the Working Group. They do not necessarily imply that these should be the diseases for which a commitment would be most appropriate. A sample advance market commitment for malaria We looked at malaria as an example of a specic case where advance contracting is needed to complement ongoing public and philanthropic funding efforts to accelerate development of an essential early-stage vaccine. We are particularly grateful to the staff of the Malaria Vaccine Initiative for contributions to this analysis, though they are not responsible for the analyses or the conclusions.The need for advance contracting for malaria The World Health Organization estimates that at least 2.3 bil - lion people are at risk from malaria and at least 1 million people, possibly as many as 2 million, die of the disease each year.4 It is possible that estimates of the burden of diseases will be increased during 2005 as a result of new analysis. More than half of all malaria deaths are among children in Sub- Saharan Africa. Though estimates of economic impact are necessar - ily based on imperfect information and multiple assumptions, some studies have estimated that malaria may reduce average economic growth in Africa by half a percentage point a year or more. 5 Malaria transmission occurs through the bite of an infected anopheles mosquito. Parasites multiply in the liver and red blood cells of affected people. Symptoms include fever, headache, mus - cular aches and weakness, vomiting and diarrhea. The disease may result in long-term debilitation or be fatal if untreated or treated with ineffective drugs. Malaria was almost completely eradicated from North Ameri - can and Europe using insecticides and environmental management. But the same can not be achieved elsewhere, for a combination of climatic and biological reasons. Africa's temperatures, mosquito species and humidity give the continent the highest malaria bur - den. Africa's malaria mosquitoes almost exclusively bite humans, which enhances the chain of human-to-human transmission. The combination of high temperatures, sufcient rainfall for mosquito breeding and human-biting anopheles mosquitoes make it much more difcult to control the disease than elsewhere. In addition, there is increasingly widespread resistance to malaria drugs and insecticides. Given that childhood vaccinations already reach more than 75% of the world's children, and the immense challenge of controlling the mosquito vector, an effective malaria vaccine suit - able for young children, which could be delivered through the EPI schedule, and for women of childbearing age would be a major and much needed addition to the prevention strategies such as insecticide-treated bednets and vector control. In addition to public funding through organizations such as NIH, two initiatives provide \"push\" support for malaria vaccines: The European Malaria Vaccine Initiative, founded in 1998 by the European Union, provides a mechanism to facilitate the development of candidate molecules through CGD 0414.indd 32 4/14/05 1:32:02 PM33 A market not a prize3the post-validation phase of nationally and internation - ally funded malaria vaccine R&D\u2014and to see candidate molecules through to limited clinical trials in close col - laboration with the African Malaria Network Trust. This is intended to ensure that appropriate vaccines are developed as quickly as possible. The Malaria Vaccine Initiative (MVI) was founded at the Program for Appropriate Technology in Health in 1999 with funding from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. It has received total funding to date of $150 million. Of the 20 vaccine candidates MVI is supporting, 8 have entered clinical development (Phase I or Phase II clinical trials). Malaria vaccine research has made painstaking gains over many years. With its multistage life cycle, malaria presents a unique and complex vaccine challenge. There are no vaccines on the market, but three types of vaccines are in development, targeting points in the malaria life cycle: pre-erythrocytic, blood stage and transmission stage. In October 2004 researchers reported preliminary results from the largest vaccine efcacy trial ever conducted in Africa.6 This Phase II trial in Mozambique of a vaccine7 was supported by MVI and GSK Biologicals. The trial found vaccine efcacy of 30% against clinical malaria attacks, 45% against primary infection with Plasmodium falciparum and 58% against severe disease. Fur - ther progress on this candidate vaccine will depend, however, on there being sufcient investment. There may be other candidate vaccines that would be as effective or more so but for which there are not sufcient resources to conduct trials. While collaboration between philanthropic foundations and the private sector has had a signicant impact on malaria vaccine development, a complementary mechanism to enhance the market is also needed for at least two reasons, as noted in chapter 2. First, more research is needed in a wider range of candidate vaccines to identify the best opportunities and accelerate progress on those ideas. Experts are in broad agreement that the rst malaria vaccine will be only partially efcacious, and efforts will be required to develop superior products as new knowledge about the immune response is obtained. The most successful vaccines are likely to be second or third generation. Second, today's funds are not sufcient to pursue enough of the possible avenues of research. After Phase II trials, the cost of developing and testing a candidate vaccine in humans escalate, and progress toward commercialization will require the prospect of a sufcient market to make it economically viable. Even if MVI put all its funding into a single candidate, and if that proved a success, there would not be enough money to bring that one candidate to licensure, nor into full-scale production. Proposed contract structure for malaria The proposed structure for an advance market contract for malaria is set out in draft contract terms sheets in appendix F (the Frame - work Agreement) and appendix G (the Guarantee Agreement). These drafts are annotated with rationales and explanations. The main characteristics of the commitment are as follows: The sponsors will make a legally binding promise to pay $14 of the cost of up to 200 million treatments purchased, at a guaranteed price of $15 per treatment (adjusted for inflation). Recipient countries will pay $1 per treatment. This can be subsidized by donor funding at the time. In return, rms will guarantee to provide further treat - ments (after the 200 million) at a sustainable base price, reflecting the cost of production, about $1 per treatment. An Independent Adjudication Committee will be estab - lished to determine whether the technical specication of the vaccine had been met. If a rm develops a subsequent, superior product (as agreed by the Independent Adjudication Committee), that prod - uct will also be eligible for the price guarantee (the price guarantee would apply to the rst 200 million treatments bought, shared among the eligible products according to demand). This offer will create an expected market of some $3 billion, approximately the average revenues for which new pharmaceu - ticals have been developed for affluent countries (see chapter 5). A commitment of this magnitude should attract some pharma - ceutical companies to invest in R&D. It is important to remember that the gures indicated above were developed as a working example, and we are not making specic recommendations. Further work and expert consultation would be required to set such parameters, in the event that a spon - sor wished to create an advance market commitment. Under very conservative assumptions\u2014for example, ignoring the benets of herd immunity, and the savings from health care CGD 0414.indd 33 4/14/05 1:32:02 PM34 A market not a prize3costs averted\u2014we estimate that the cost will be about $15 per disability-adjusted life year (DALY) saved (discounted in 2004 dollars), making vaccine purchases under the program one of the world's most cost-effective development interventions (box 3.2 and table 3.1). Once the commitment of 200 million doses has expired, the cost of the vaccine will fall to the sustainable long-run price. Advance market commitments for rotavirus and pneumococcus Recent developments in a vaccine for rotavirus Rotavirus is the most common cause of severe dehydrating diarrhea among children worldwide. Each year it causes more than 100 mil - lion cases of disease, 25 million clinic visits and between 350,000 and 590,000 deaths in children ages ve or younger. Nearly every child in the world is exposed to rotavirus before reaching age ve, but, because of lack of access to health care, the children who die of rotavirus are in the very poorest countries. At present, the only treatment for rotavirus involves preventing dehydration by providing fluids and salts until the disease runs its course; neither antibiotics nor other drugs can cure rotavirus. A vaccine has recently been licensed in Mexico: a human- derived, monovalent, live, attenuated two-to-three-dose oral vac by Avant Immunotherapeutics and licensed to GSK Biologicals. This product has undergone Phase III trials in Latin America and is in Phase II trials in Bangladesh, Singapore and South Africa. A second vaccine is close to licensure: a bovine- human reassortant, pentavalent, live-attenuated three-dose oral vaccine developed by Merck is now in Phase III trials in Central and South America. In addition, Biovirx has recently indicated that it will pursue licensing for a rotavirus vaccine that had previ - ously been sold in the U.S. market but was withdrawn for fears of adverse effects. 9 Box 3.2 What is a DALY? A disability-adjusted life year, or DALY, is a unit used for measuring both the global burden of disease and the effectiveness of health intervention. DALYs were introduced as a unit of measurement in the World Development Report 1993: Investing in Health (World Bank 1993), and in 1996 a joint effort by WHO, the World Bank and the Harvard School of Public Health produced The Global Burden of Disease (Murray and Lopez 1996) in which the DALY methodology and nd - ings were presented in more detail. DALYs are intended to combine losses from pre - mature death, dened as the differences between actual age at death and life expectancy at that age in a low-mortality population, and losses of healthy life resulting from disability. Because the benets of all health interventions can be measured this way, DALYs allow comparisons between different interventions and overcome some of the problems associated with using analysis relevant only for specic conditions or that relies on placing a monetary value on saving lives.Table 3.1 Some estimates of the cost per DALY of development interventions Intervention Cost per DALY ($)a Malaria vaccine under advance market commitment of $15 per treatment (conservative estimate)15 Condom distribution 12-99 Integrated management of childhood illness30-100 Tuberculosis prevention 169-288 Antiretroviral therapy for HIV 1,100-1,800 b Family planning 20-30c Prenatal and delivery care 30-50 Water supply (village pump) 94 Malaria bednets 19-85 Malaria residual spraying 16-19 a.

The Rotavirus ADIP was established by GAVI to lay the foun - dation for rapid introduction and sustainable supply of rst- generation rotavirus vaccines. One of the most important elements of this project is to secure the supply of affordable vaccines in predictable quantities. Recent developments in a vaccine for pneumococcus More children die each year from pneumonia than from any other disease\u2014even more than malaria or AIDS\u2014and nearly all these deaths occur in the world's poorest countries.10 Unlike malaria and AIDS, vaccines are available to prevent these deaths. But without a coordinated effort and forward planning, it will prob - ably take 20 years or more for these vaccines to reach even half the children in the world's poorest countries\u2014in part because of the high cost but also because of the lack of reliable and pre - dictable demand. A vaccine against the second-leading cause of bacterial pneu - monia deaths\u2014a bacterium called Hib ( Haemophilus influenzae type B)\u2014has been available since the late 1980s. It has been widely used in all wealthy countries, and as a result Hib disease has nearly disappeared altogether in those countries. But in 2002\u201415 years after the vaccine was rst used in wealthy countries\u2014fewer than 15% of the world's poorest children were receiving the vaccine. The leading cause of bacterial pneumonia deaths\u2014a bacte - rium called Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus)\u2014is now preventable by immunization with a vaccine very similar to the Hib vaccine. In 2000 the United States licensed a pneumococ - cal conjugate vaccine for prevention of severe pneumococcal infections in infants and young children. Like the Hib conjugate vaccines, this vaccine has proven to be safe and very effective in randomized clinical trials. In studies in Finland and the United States, the vaccine was shown to signicantly reduce the incidence of severe pneumococcal infections, such as meningitis, pneumo - nia and septicemia, and to prevent ear infections. Since 2000 it has been routinely used in the United States and other wealthy countries but not in the developed world. GAVI's Pneumococcal ADIP aims to increase access to new life-saving pneumococcal vaccines and ultimately prevent millions of deaths by getting vaccines where they are needed most, faster than ever. The ADIP has articulated a three-part mission: to establish, communicate and deliver the value of existing (and next-generation) pneumococcal vaccines. The ADIP is currently funding disease surveillance networks, clini - cal trials in target populations and cost-effectiveness studies. An important part of its mission will depend on delivering products to GAVI's target countries at a price and volume that they can afford. Goals of an advance market commitment for pneumococcus and rotavirus Against this background, an advance market commitment will: Ensure that rst-generation products are tested in the popu - lations that need them most. Provide an incentive for suppliers to produce the vaccine in quantities that will meet the needs of the developing world over time. Influence decisions about the presentation and characteris - tics of the product so that it better meets the needs of the developing world. Influence the long-term pricing of the product. There is a clear need for advance market commitments to secure the right prole, price and supply of these vaccines. Com - bined with more concerted demand-side interventions, this will be instrumental in shortening the gap of 10-15 years seen in the introduction of recent vaccines, such as hepatitis B and Hib vaccine. The ADIPs for pneumococcus and rotavirus are important steps in this direction and, while they do not yet have the mandate to negotiate such contracts, they consider long-term advance contracting as potentially critical to achiev - ing their mission. Proposed contract structure for a late- stage product We considered an advance contract for late-stage products, which could be applied to vaccines for rotavirus and pneumococcus. Unlike the early-stage contract, the late-stage contract in these cases will be with one or more specic suppliers. (The Framework Agreement stage included in the early stage contracts would be unnecessary.) The contract with the supplier will be very similar to the Guarantee Agreement of an early-stage product. CGD 0414.indd 35 4/14/05 1:32:03 PM36 A market not a prize3The main characteristics of the agreement will be as follows: The sponsor commits to pay a relatively high price for a course of immunization, up to a certain number (say, the rst 100 million courses). In return for receiving the higher price at rst, the supplier guarantees to provide vaccine indenitely to qualifying countries, at a much lower price. The lower, long-run price would be set at a reasonable mark-up over the estimated production cost. If the supplier does not fulll demand at this lower price, given adequate notice, the contract would provide for dam - ages, or require that a restricted license be given to the sponsor or to the public domain (to supply only Vaccine Fund-eligible countries). The contract might commit the sponsor to guarantee some minimum order, but after the initial volume is reached, the vaccine may have to compete against other products, so there would still be an incentive for other rms to enter if they could produce superior products or manufacture more cheaply. The contract could be signed prior to regulatory approval, but it is conditional on regulatory approval and the expected performance of the vaccine. There are a number of advantages to this approach for devel - oping countries, for suppliers and for sponsors. The supplier obtains a more predictable revenue stream. The supplier has incentives to install capacity quickly, since the net present value of its revenue will be greater the faster the rst 100 million people are immunized. There is no long-term commitment to buy the product if a superior product is developed later. Both suppliers and consumers are better off than they would be with a system of short-run contracts with a single supplier. Uncertainty will be reduced for both. If prices are chosen appropriately, overall revenue and prots will increase, mak - ing the supplier better off. But the number of immunizations will also increase signicantly, lowering the average price per person immunized and improving cost-effectiveness. The contract ensures sustainability for countries and donors in the long run. Because countries know that they will have access to the vaccine at affordable prices over the long run, they can be more condent in adding it to their immunization schedules without fear that they will not be able to afford the vaccine later and will have to reverse their strategy. The contract sets a good precedent for advance market commitments aimed at stimulating investment in early- stage products\u2014and builds condence in that commitment mechanism. Risks and benets of an advance market commitment We have based our design of the advance market commitment on economic principles, practical realities and extensive consul - tation with donors, industry and the public health community. We set out here how the mechanism we have designed meets the principal objectives of the main stakeholders and the risks and challenges that the commitment must address. Benets for donors The commitment would likely accelerate the development of new vaccines, which are one of the most cost-effective ways to tackle poverty, improve the health of vulnerable popula - tions and meet the Millennium Development Goals. There will be a cost to sponsors only if the program succeeds and a new vaccine is developed. If no vaccine is developed, there is no signicant cost to the sponsors. If a vaccine is developed, it will save millions of lives at very low cost. The commitment is payment-for-results.11 If a vaccine is developed, it will be available rapidly to people who need it, in contrast to recent experience with new vaccines. Vaccine purchases under the commitment will be a highly cost-effective use of aid in comparison with other interventions. Existing and future donor support for R&D investment will be more productive as a result of complementary private investment. Donors will increase the productivity of their likely future expenditure by making it predictable. The commitment is sustainable; once the advance market at a guaranteed price has been exhausted, the suppliers will provide further vaccines at a guaranteed low price, unlike open-ended commitments to subsidize purchases indenitely. CGD 0414.indd 36 4/14/05 1:32:04 PM37 A market not a prize3 Aid spending on R&D for, and delivery of, vaccines is low risk, with few opportunities for corruption and rent- seeking. Points for donors to watch It is important not to be locked into a contract to spend $3 billion on a vaccine that is not needed, for reasons unfore - seen at the time the commitment is made. The commitment to create a market, rather than a prize, protects donors by ensuring that their commitment is to underwrite the cost of vaccines for which there is actually demand. The commitment should be structured in a way that does not require donors to move money from current priorities, including health R&D, so that it is available for uncertain future obligations to purchase a vaccine. A commitment to purchase a vaccine if and when it is available does not score in public spending until the vaccine is supplied. In the mean - time, existing expenditure priorities can continue to be funded (chapter 7 explains in more detail). Donors should avoid unnecessarily driving up the price of vaccines. The structure of the contract ensures that the higher prices paid for the initial doses leads more quickly to long-term sustainable prices, keeping long run costs down; by contrast, under current arrangements, increased funding of vaccine purchases is likely to push up prices. Furthermore, compared with a cost-plus arrangement, an advance market commitment creates stronger incentives to keep the costs of production as low as possible to recoup the highest prot. Donors should not overpay for R&D costs of vaccine devel - opment. We don't know for certain what it will cost to develop a new vaccine. Creating commercial incentives for competition in the most expensive phases of the process will allow rms to make judgments about the best use of available resources. A larger donor commitment will encourage more competition and faster development of a new vaccine\u2014which would be money well spent. Benets for industry The commitment would extend the overall size of the mar - ket in which rms operate, creating opportunities to expand the scope of their business and providing a new path for growth. The commitment signicantly reduces the risk that, if a life-saving health product is invented, it will be subject to compulsory licensing, or that the rm will be forced to sell it at a loss, either because of pressure of public opinion or because of the purchasing power of public procurement. The advance market commitment creates a risk-reward structure that rms are already familiar with and that puts these decisions in the same framework as other investments: they will be rewarded if they bring a product to market that governments want to buy. Unlike many of the alternative proposals for increasing R&D in diseases concentrated in developing countries, the advance market commitment addresses the access issue without weakening incentives or dismantling the system of intellectual property rights. The opportunity for commercially driven investment in vaccines reduces the risk of growing activism and anger directed at pharmaceutical companies because of the perceived lack of investment in neglected diseases\u2014and because of the need to charge prices that make essential medicines unaffordable to the very poor. The commitment does not reduce donor resources available for the purchase of existing vaccines and drugs or for the investment in health systems, which increase demand for existing products. Points for industry to watch The donors must not be able to renege on their commit - ment when a vaccine is developed that meets the technical specication. The advance market commitment would be legally binding and enforceable in the courts. The Independent Adjudication Committee, which decides if a vaccine qualies for the co-payment guarantee, is an important safeguard for industry, and industry should pay close attention to its com - position, funding and organizational arrangements. The commitment must not allow copy products to take the guaranteed market. The Independent Adjudication Com - mittee is responsible for ensuring that second and subsequent products that meet the technical specication are superior, and not merely generic copies. A substantial portion of demand risk remains with the rm. The market guarantee removes the risk relating to the CGD 0414.indd 37 4/14/05 1:32:04 PM38 A market not a prize3poverty of the nal consumer and the incentives of the public purchaser to secure the best possible price once the R&D costs are sunk. The demand risks that (rightly) remain with rms relate to the quality of the product, the quality of competitors and the speed of making the product available. These are risks that rms are best placed to manage\u2014and risks that rms are used to bearing in affluent markets. The two-stage pricing structure\u2014with bigger returns early on\u2014greatly reduces the risk to rms and encourages early innovation. As shown in chapter 4, even if uptake is somewhat slow, the risk to rms is still much lower than it would be with a constant price. The creation of a market for the nal product may not be enough to create incentives for intermediate R&D. A market of this size, combined with the response from the pharmaceutical industry, has been enough to spur the biotech sector and venture capitalist investment in R&D for phar - maceuticals for affluent markets. Benets for developing countries An advance market commitment is likely signicantly to accelerate the development of essential vaccines, the best hope for sustainably improving the health of people in poor countries. The commitment ensures that, if a new vaccine is devel - oped, it will be rapidly available in developing countries at an affordable price, unlike previous vaccines, which have been available only after a long delay. There are many very poor people in countries that are not currently eligible for Vaccine Fund support, for whom it is a priority to increase affordable access to vaccines. For countries that are not eligible for vaccines purchased under the advance market commitment there would still be con - siderable benets arising from the advance market com - mitment, because signicantly more new vaccines would be likely to be produced. Experts and decisionmakers from developing countries could participate in the initial establishment of the tech - nical specications, ensuring that products developed are appropriate to in-country conditions. The commitment offers open competition for developing- country biotechs and larger rms to compete to provide new vaccines, perhaps through joint ventures with multinational pharmaceutical companies. There are no adverse macroeconomic or exchange rate effects for developing countries as a result of increased devel - opment assistance provided in the form of co-payments for imported pharmaceuticals. Points for developing countries to watch The contract must allow superior products to be bought if they are developed. Because this is a market not a prize, developing countries can switch demand to superior products that qualify for the guarantee as soon as they are available. Developing countries will have to make some payments for the vaccines. The payments will be small, because donors bear most of the guaranteed price. The developing countries' contribution ensures that they are the ultimate customers for the vaccines and can decide their priorities. As is the case today, recipient countries can seek donor assistance for their contributions when the vaccines are available. The long-term price must be affordable. The commitment ensures that vaccines will be available to all eligible countries at affordable prices in the long term (and that the higher price will be subsidized by donors in the meantime). This ensures that vaccine programs are sustainable in the long run, and so enables governments to expand their vaccination programs with condence. An advance market commitment is only a partial solution Theory and evidence predict that an advance market commitment would substantially increase commercial investment in R&D on vaccines for developing countries and that it would accelerate the development and availability of new vaccines. But much else can and should be done to accelerate R&D and improve access to vaccines. Steps that could make a substantial contribution include: Greater donor funding of the purchase of existing vaccines and drugs for diseases in developing countries, which will save many lives immediately and increase the perceived value of the market in the future. CGD 0414.indd 38 4/14/05 1:32:04 PM39 A market not a prize3 Increased upfront donor funding of R&D into health con - ditions concentrated in developing countries, including investment in R&D for new vaccines. Improved demand forecasting to enable producers to invest in manufacturing capacity of an appropriate size. Advance market commitments are an additional tool, focused on an important deciency in the current arrangements for the development of new vaccines: the lack of adequate incentives for commercial investment. We consider that commercial engage - ment in the development of new vaccines is critical for the rapid development and production of new vaccines. We believe that advance market commitments can and will make a substantial contribution to accelerating new vaccines and that they should be a high priority for donors and the industry. But in advocating their rapid introduction we are mindful of the need not to lose sight of the importance of other steps that would also improve the effectiveness of the market for vaccines. CGD 0414.indd 39 1:32:05 PMChapter at a glance The legal framework for an advance market commitment is founded on ordinary contract law. (See the draft contract term sheets in appendixes F and G.) Our multidisciplinary team comprising lawyers, public health specialists, economists and public policy specialists has considered the detailed design of the commitment with the aim of creating an appropriate set of incentives. We explain our recommendations for the arrangements for the structure of the contract, the technical specication of the vaccine and the organization of the Independent Adjudication Committee. Creating a market rather than a prize solves many of the challenges in designing incentives for R&D. The commitment is designed not only to reward the rst producer to bring a product to market but also to create incentives for continuing R&D to create second- generation products that improve on the original. Within this broad framework are a number of detailed design choices and variants that should be considered. This will require further discussion among the stakeholders as the details of the commitment are decided. CGD 0414.indd 41 4/14/05 1:32:05 PM42 Design choices 4Legal issues: the contract structure The advance market commitment would derive its credibility\u2014 and thus its ability to influence investment behavior\u2014from the legal enforceability of the contracts. This is essential to provide enough assurances to developers to induce them to undertake the large investment for developing a new product. The challenge is to design contracts sufciently xed to ensure that the donors cannot renege on their commitment when a vaccine is developed, but still flexible enough to accommodate contingencies not foreseen when the rules were established. Working with experienced contract lawyers specializing in the pharmaceutical industry we have drawn up draft term sheets to illustrate the proposed contract (appendixes F and G). These are based on standard contract law, and the component parts of the proposed legal structure are common in law and business. Some elements of the contract design and incentive structure will depend on the particular product for which the advance market commitment is implemented. But some core elements should be common to advance market commitments, whether for late-stage or early-stage products. Sponsors, developers and suppliers Four parties are fundamental to the design\u2014and eventual success\u2014of the advance market commitment. The rst is the sponsor\u2014the entity that accepts the contractual obligations associated with funding the market demand. This may be one or more nongovernmental or government grant-making organiza - tions, and must be a legal entity. The second is a developer\u2014one or more pharmaceutical or biotech companies interested in pursuing the contract offered by the sponsor. The third is a des - ignated supplier\u2014that is, one or more developers who actually end up signing the agreement to supply the targeted product. For some products, particularly late-stage products, a single developer may also be the designated supplier. The fourth are the governments of developing countries that would benet from the vaccines. Legally binding bilateral contracts A bilateral contract is one signed by two parties: it becomes bind - ing on the parties as soon as they exchange adequate consideration, which may be in the form of mutual promises, and it allows either party to pursue standard contract remedies, such as money dam -ages and specic performance, if the other party fails to satisfy its contractual commitments. The bilateral structure, as distinct from a unilateral offer or a prize, creates enforceable obligations, making the funding commitment of the sponsor more credible. The advance market commitment involves two types of legally binding agreements: First, an open agreement\u2014the Framework Agreement\u2014 indicating the availability of a reward for any rms pro - ducing a product meeting pre-specied conditions. In this case, the reward is the right to sign the second contract (appendix F), which will be attached to, and incorporated into, the Framework Agreement. Firms interested in pursu - ing the R&D of a qualifying product, regardless of whether they are presently doing so, may sign on to this agreement, creating a binding obligation on the part of the sponsor to enter into the Guarantee Agreement with any rm that delivers a qualifying product. Second, a bilateral procurement agreement or Guarantee Agreement (appendix G). The contractual commitments of the sponsor are clear from the outset to provide the promised reward: making co-payments at the guaranteed price, upon satisfaction of the eligibility criteria. Requirements on the developers under the Framework Agreement are minimal. If they succeed in developing a qualifying product, they are entitled to sign the Guarantee Agreement. Under this agreement, in return for being able to sell a number of doses of vaccine at the guaranteed price, the developer guarantees to supply the vaccine to eligible countries at a sustainable low price. For early-stage products, it is important to have an open agree - ment at the outset\u2014the Framework Agreement\u2014so that many rms can compete to develop a product. But for late-stage products, where the market landscape (such as rst-generation suppliers and the time lag to second-generation candidates) and product prole are already known with some certainty, it is possible to proceed directly to the Guarantee Agree - ment, in which the sponsors underwrite a price guarantee. The Framework Agreement The Framework Agreement establishes the rules for the competi - tion among potential vaccine developers. Issued by the sponsors, it must be signed by the companies to become binding. At this stage there are only minimal obligations on the part of the signing CGD 0414.indd 42 4/14/05 1:32:06 PM43 Design choices 4companies. The Framework Agreement creates the mechanism for the company to enforce the sponsors' commitment to move to a Guarantee Agreement for qualifying products. The Framework Agreement also sets forth eligibility require - ments for the vaccine (\u00a78), creating an Independent Adjudication Committee (IAC) to adjudicate whether the requirements have been met by any candidate vaccine (\u00a713-18) and establishing the rules for legal recourse (\u00a727-29). Finally, the Framework Agreement species the incentive mechanism: that a developer of a vaccine meeting the technical specications and usability requirements is entitled to enter the Guarantee Agreement with the sponsor (\u00a75) (appendix F). The Guarantee Agreement The Guarantee Agreement is a bilateral contract between the sponsor and any winners from the open stage (or designated sup - pliers). The sponsor must irrevocably guarantee that the desig - nated supplier receives the pre-specied reward (price guarantee) for any qualied sales, subject to some also pre-specied cap on the sponsor's total commitment (\u00a73). Qualied sales would be restricted to those that meet criteria established in the original commitment (for example, that the vaccine will be used in a Vac - cine Fund-eligible country) (\u00a76). Guarantee Agreements could be signed with one designated supplier or with multiple suppliers, depending on the rules set out in the Framework Agreement, which would in turn depend on the objectives of the sponsors (\u00a71). The Guarantee Agreement must also specify contract terms related to intellectual property rights, where relevant (\u00a79) (appendix G). The Independent Adjudication Committee The IAC is an impartial oversight body at the heart of the cred - ibility of the advance market commitment. The IAC will: Decide if a product has met the eligibility criteria. It will have the authority to waive or modify technical specica - tions and usability requirements as appropriate, but only to make modications that can lower the bar to accept vac - cines that do not meet the specications in full. The IAC will not have discretion to raise the bar once the framework offer has been made, except in the limited case of a force majeure event, and then only with a super-majority vote, which is subject to judicial review (\u00a722). Designate approved regulatory bodies (or more likely, designate an approval mechanism\u2014such as the WHO prequalication process) (\u00a75). Be the main point of contact with developers throughout the competition. Once a qualifying vaccine has been identied, the IAC will monitor sales, use and performance of approved vaccines and designate new vaccines as approved under the terms of the Frame - work Agreement (\u00a78). Importantly, the IAC's operational budget\u2014to be provided by the sponsors\u2014must be independent so that the sponsors are unable to influence the decisions of the committee after establish - ing the rules of the game (\u00a718). Similarly, there will be straight - forward rules allowing the IAC to recruit new members in the case of retirement or death (\u00a713). The composition of the IAC is critical to the success of advance market commitment. It should consist of a combina - tion of ex-industry, global health experts, vaccine scientists and legal specialists. In our consultations with industry, rms emphasized the need for a credible adjudication body and expressed concern about the potential for abuse. The rules must be clearly determined in advance, including dispute resolution. There was strong opinion in favor of having current or recent industry experience repre - sented on the committee. Dispute resolution It is impossible to foresee everything that may occur during the life of the advance market commitment. A number of scenarios can be imagined in advance and addressed in the contracts, but the most useful approach to the many unknown scenarios is to establish a clear and credible process for making decisions as events unfold. While most decisions will be made by the IAC, a decision to invoke the force majeure clause should be subject to legal recourse through the courts if necessary (\u00a716). Exit provisions It may be sensible to include sunset provisions in the contract to allow sponsors to exit after a certain length of time. For example, if 30 years pass and no substantial progress has been made on the product of interest, a vaccine commitment may not be the most CGD 0414.indd 43 4/14/05 1:32:06 PM44 Design choices 4useful approach, and the policy would be worth re-evaluating. So, a sunset clause might be included to specify that, at any time after 20 years had passed, sponsors could give notice that they would let the commitment lapse after 10 years, if no vaccine had been developed by then (\u00a725). Another type of exit provision\u2014a force majeure clause\u2014could allow the obligations to end if the disease environment changed enough to obviate or radically reduce the need for the vaccine. Such changes could occur, for example, if other technologies were developed to control the disease, such as vastly better insecticides against the mosquitoes that transmit malaria. To deal with such contingencies, a vaccine commitment might specify that the sponsor's obligation would end if the independent adjudication committee determined that the burden of disease had fallen by more than 50% or 75% (\u00a722). To avoid the danger that a force majeure clause might be used by a sponsor to renege on the commitment, it would be impor - tant to: Establish clear standards in the Framework Agreement for invoking the force majeure provision. Vest the authority to invoke this clause with the IAC, which would be chosen for its credibility, rather than the sponsor, which might have a nancial interest in the decision. Require a super-majority of the IAC\u2014perhaps a three- quarters vote\u2014to invoke such a clause. Make any decision to invoke the clause subject to legal challenge. Eligibility requirements Eligibility requirements would dene the desired product and other elements required of the developer of the desired product to qualify as a designated supplier. Dening appropriate eligibility requirements is critical to the success of the commitment. The eligibility requirements would be set by the sponsors in advance, after discussion with key stakeholders (see appendix F). The requirements might include: Technical requirements on the product: indication, target population, minimum efcacy requirements, duration of protection, interference. Usability requirements on the product: dosage, route of immunization, presentation, storage, safety requirements. Specications of regulatory approval and quality control.Because these would become the targets of research and prod - uct development once established, the framework agreement must not allow sponsors to make the requirements more demanding after it is established. Since products may be useful without per - fectly matching all eligibility criteria, the adjudication commit - tee might be given authority to relax the requirements to accept products that nearly meet the pre-established requirement (\u00a75). In addition, sponsors may establish eligibility requirements on \"qualied sales\" of a product\u2014for example, that products be sold to a UN agency, developing country or other approved buyer, or that products must be used in a Vaccine Fund or other eligible country. These too must be clearly established from the outset\u2014and must not be subsequently changed to become more onerous. In our consultations with industry, we found that rms were in favor of setting the bar on product specications high enough that the sponsor could have reasonable assurance that the product would serve public health needs and be accepted by the relevant developing-country governments. There was also a consensus that there should be a procedure to make the specications less onerous in case a useful product were developed that did not completely meet all specications. Industry representatives indicated that they should have the opportunity to review and provide input on product specications before those specications were set. Some rms wanted the opportunity to engage in a dialogue with the adjudication committee during the development process to determine whether the committee would be likely to grant waiv - ers from the stated eligibility guidelines and to learn more about how those guidelines would be interpreted. (This is similar to procedures under which rms have the opportunity to consult the U.S. Food and Drug Administration so that they may structure their pivotal clinical trials and prepare drug approval applications so as to meet better the expectations of the regulatory authority that will be responsible for approving their products.) Some public health experts were concerned that it would be dif - cult to establish in advance technical requirements that a vaccine would need to meet. Clearly, it is difcult to say in advance exactly what the characteristics of a successful vaccine will be. But there was a consensus that, if the requirements were framed as outputs rather than a specication of inputs, it would be possible\u2014though complicated\u2014to agree to product requirements in advance. For example, while it would not be desirable to specify in advance whether a malaria vaccine should be a \"blood stage\" vaccine, it CGD 0414.indd 44 4/14/05 choices 4would make sense for the specication to include some minimum duration of protection against severe malaria. Co-payment and the case against quantity guarantee We concluded that the advance market commitment should guar - antee a minimum price for the vaccine but should not guaran - tee a minimum quantity that would be bought from each sup - plier at this price. In this way, the commitment is a market not a prize. There are several reasons why we concluded this was preferable. The case against a quantity guarantee and for co-payment First, a quantity guarantee would greatly complicate the drafting of the technical specications\u2014and perhaps make it impossible. It is possible that a product might meet all the pre-announced eligibility requirements and still be unsuitable for use in poor countries. For example, if a vaccine generated side effects that were medically harmless but culturally unacceptable, there might be an unwillingness to use the vaccine. Attempts to impose its use might even be counterproductive, reducing the acceptability of vaccination in general. It is impossible to anticipate all the pos - sible contingencies in which the purchase of a seemingly effective vaccine would not be warranted, and consequently it is not pos - sible to attempt to write them into the technical specications. We concluded that the commitment should be to pay for vaccine only if there is demand for the vaccine and if a recipient country is willing to take the steps necessary to ensure that the product is delivered to those who need it. This ensures that sponsors do not nd themselves legally obliged to spend $3 billion on a vac - cine that nobody wants. A modest co-payment, either from the country or from a donor, will provide a market test of interest in the vaccine and reduce the risk of waste. As is now the case, a donor could provide the payment through development assistance. A second benet of not guaranteeing to buy a particular quan - tity is that it avoids the problem of deciding what to do if several competing products are successfully introduced. If a superior product becomes available and so qualies for the price guar - anteed under the advance market commitment, the developing countries can choose to use the product most appropriate for their circumstances because donors are not locked in to paying for a particular quantity from a particular producer. Our proposed approach of creating a market rather than a prize therefore greatly simplies the problems that would other - wise occur in trying to draw up a specication that anticipates all eventualities, and in trying to create room for superior products to be developed to enter the market. Keeping the co-payment low A disadvantage of the co-payment is that it may add a small amount of uncertainty about whether a product will eventually be purchased, and so may increase the rms' perception of demand risk. This suggests that co-payments should be modest. Furthermore, requiring a large co-payment might limit access to the product, and by reducing the prospects of adoption it would also reduce incentives for developers. In principle, the developing country co-payment should be broadly the same amount per course of treatment as the long-term price of the vaccine under the contract. This ensures that develop - ing countries will be asked to pay an affordable and sustainable low price from the outset, which they can be sure will continue when the commitment is exhausted. The allocation of demand risk The absence of a quantity guarantee, and the need for co-payments from developing countries, leave some demand risk in the hands of the developers. Given that our objective is to make investment in medicines for neglected diseases more attractive and less risky, we asked ourselves whether the program would be more success - ful if sponsors took over all the demand risk. When we discussed this with industry, there was a good under - standing of the case for a price guarantee but no quantity guar - antee for early-stage products. This allocation of risk resembles the market for medicines in developed countries, in which ability to pay is relatively favorable but quantities are not guaranteed. In this environment rms must bear the risk that customers will not want their product or that they will lose market share to a better product. The proposed pricing structure\u2014with a high price paid for the rst treatments purchased and a low price thereafter\u2014actually transfers a substantial portion of the demand risk from the rms to the sponsors, since the net present value of the revenues to the CGD 0414.indd 45 4/14/05 1:32:07 PM46 Design choices 4company is much more stable that it would be under a single price charged over a longer time period. The spreadsheet model dem - onstrates that, under a more pessimistic scenario in which it takes 15 years for adoption to reach steady-state levels, and adoption reached levels only 10 percentage points below the DPT3 rates, the program would still generate $2.7 billion in revenue in net present value terms for the vaccine developer (in 2004 dollars), and would cost less than $20 per DALY saved. It is most efcient for risks to be borne by the party that can manage them best. It is desirable for industry to bear some of the demand risk, so that there is an incentive to focus work on pro - ducing the most effective and usable product. Under the advance market commitment we have designed, the sponsors would bear the risks associated with unpredictable donor funding and pres - sure for low pricing, while leaving industry to manage the risks associated with the usefulness of the product. The guaranteed price Chapter 5 looks in more detail at the calculation of the appro - priate guaranteed price. The goal is to set a price high enough to accelerate R&D in a vaccine for the disease, but at a level at which the purchase of the vaccine, if and when one is developed, is a cost-effective use of aid resources. To get the full advantage of the commitment, sponsors would need to commit to an overall price well above the pennies-per-dose now paid for existing vaccines in developing countries. The benet of low prices is that they ensure access to existing vaccines, but they are not sufcient to generate investment in new vaccines or to ensure that new vaccines are rapidly made available in developing countries. Donors increasingly understand that, for vaccines that have only a small market in affluent countries, it will be neces - sary for rms to recover their R&D costs through higher prices in developing countries than they charge for existing vaccines. Two-stage pricing We recommend a two-stage pricing system. In the rst stage, a relatively high price (the \"guaranteed price\") would be guaran - teed up to a xed maximum of treatments purchased. In return for the right to sell at that higher price for the initial treatments sold, the supplier would be contractually committed to supplying further treatments at a lower price set at a level close to the cost of production (the \"base price\").Why have two-stage pricing? Two-stage pricing is attractive to developing countries and spon - sors because it would ensure long-term sustainability of the vaccine program. This ensures that sponsors are not undertaking a long-term commitment to purchase vaccines indenitely, but rather are making a nite commitment that pays for the risk-adjusted costs of R&D and gearing up production, albeit in a different form. Thereafter, pricing is close to marginal cost, which ensures an efcient level of use. This price structure would also create a strong incentive for rms to accelerate development, because there would be a more substantial reward for the rst developer (who could capture the bulk of the high-price market), while the prospect of capturing part of the high-price market would preserve an incentive for the development of improved vaccines later. A two-stage pricing structure is also attractive to the vac - cine developers, because the front-loading of payments would enable them to recover their investment more quickly and with greater certainty than if they charged a single lower price for more doses over a longer time. We found in our discussions with industry that the proposed two-stage price was both understood and welcome. How would two-stage pricing be implemented in practice? In return for receiving the guaranteed price for the initial doses, and so recovering their investment, the designated suppliers will be contractually required to supply subsequent doses to eligible countries at the base price, until generics manufacturers take up production, if reasonable notice of demand is given. If a com - pany is not able or chooses not to fulll that obligation, it faces nancial penalties under the contract. Alternatively, it would be required to license the technology for use for developing-country markets or to have the technology placed in the public domain to allow generics producers to meet demand instead. Once the guaranteed price commitment is satised, the donors are under no obligation to buy any doses at the base price, but the supplier is under an obligation to meet demand at that price. The guaranteed (higher) price will be set in advance in the Framework Agreement, at the outset of the commitment. The Framework Agreement will specify how it is to be adjusted for inflation. The price will vary according to the disease. CGD 0414.indd 46 4/14/05 1:32:07 PM47 Design choices 4The base (lower) price can either be set in advance as a dollar amount per treatment or determined by an agreed formula related to the cost of production. There are advantages and disadvantages to each approach. It would be possible to devise more complex hybrid options\u2014for example, in which the sponsors and the producers share the benets of reducing the cost of production through a formula. Setting the long-term base price is a critical component of the advance market commitment. Although this is not uncompli - cated, we believe that it will be possible to agree an appropriate price, or formula, that is affordable for developing countries while covering the cost of production. Allowing second entrants but avoiding \"me too\" copies The advance market commitment is intended to create a market, not simply to reward the rst supplier. We recommend that second and subsequent vaccine suppliers be allowed to compete for the market as designated suppliers, if their products are deemed (by the Independent Adjudication Committee) to be superior, at least in some relevant respect, to existing qualifying products. Allowing second qualiers The ease with which second and subsequent products can qualify needs to balance, on the one hand, the need to avoid creating incentives that lead to wasteful duplication of research that does not lead to improvements, and, on the other hand, the need to ensure that there is scope for incremental improvements as the technology improves. Our proposal\u2014that qualifying vaccines be allowed to enter the market if they can demonstrate that they are superior\u2014is intended to balance these considerations. It is possible that several different products will be licensed at about the same time. In this case it would be sensible to allow them to share the market at the outset. To achieve this, the con - tract could allow a window\u2014say one year\u2014within which second qualifying products would be eligible for the guarantee without having to demonstrate superiority. Sharing the guaranteed market among more than one supplier The guaranteed price is limited to a xed number of treatments, even if there is more than one qualifying product. In other words, if there were more than one designated supplier and countries split their demand across the suppliers, no single rm would sell the full designated number of treatments at the guaranteed price. Once the designated number of treatments has been bought, under the contract suppliers would be required to provide vaccines at a lower price. But at that stage, no supplier would have received the full revenue of the advance market commitment. We therefore propose that, if a designated supplier has not yet received a pre-determined minimum revenue (which would be less than the total advance market commitment), it be allowed to charge a xed mark-up over the agreed base price, until its total revenues reach that minimum revenue. Should we improve the terms over time? Some industry representatives suggested that sponsors could estab - lish an initial contract but then improve the offer depending on market response. One suggestion was that sponsors could be encouraged to add to the market reward as a successful candi - date emerges. Firms with a promising candidate would then be motivated to invest in more expensive trials to reach the growing market. Others suggested that prices or other contract terms be made more attractive to industry over time if the initial terms do not generate the expected response. This approach has many of the attributes of an auction, which could identify low-cost producers. If the price did not rise too quickly, this would not lead to strategic delay. The Working Group felt that this approach did not have to be included in the initial con - tract and that it would be open to the sponsors to add it later. CGD 0414.indd 47 4/14/05 1:32:08 PMChapter at a glance Our aim is to set a market size large enough to attract serious commercial investment from several pharmaceutical companies that see technological opportunites, while ensuring that the cost of the vaccines purchased is less than the social value and better value for money than alternative uses for the funds. A market of $3. 1 billion is comparable to the value of lifetime sales of an average pharmaceutical product. Given that expected sales for existing products were sufcient to attract commercial investment from pharmaceutical rms, we recommend commitments worth about $3 billion per disease for early stage products such as malaria. Our recommendation is not based on any estimated cost of vaccine R&D. It is based on the realized sales revenues of existing commercial products. As an example, taking account of (modest) expected revenues from other markets, a price of $15 per malaria treatment, for 200 million treatments, would provide this revenue and would be exceptionally good value for money in terms of health cost-effectiveness. Larger commitments would likely further accelerate development of vaccines; even with higher costs, vaccines would still be a bargain in development spending. CGD 0414.indd 49 4/14/05 1:32:08 PM50 $3 billion per disease 5Determining the size of the market needed Goals In setting the parameters of the advance market commitment, the sponsors should aim to: Set the guaranteed market revenue high enough to acceler - ate R&D in the selected vaccine. Set the size of the commitment below the social value of the vaccine, so that the sponsors do not commit themselves to paying more for the vaccine than it is worth to society. Specically, the commitment should be low enough that spending on the vaccine is cost-effective compared with alternative development interventions. It turns out that there is a large window between these lower and upper bounds for setting a commitment. In other words, a wide range of guaranteed prices and maximum quantities would give rms a good return on investment in R&D and still repre - sent an excellent bargain for sponsors seeking to maximize the effectiveness of their spending. We do not believe that the optimal market commitment is the minimum level needed to lead to a vaccine eventually being developed, even if we thought there were some way to estimate this. If a larger market commitment is likely to lead to a vaccine being developed more quickly, with greater certainty or with more competition, accelerating the development of a vaccine by paying more for it would likely be a very good investment. The optimal market size, therefore, is likely to be somewhat above the minimum R&D cost needed to develop the vaccine. What market size is needed to accelerate vaccine development? The larger the expected value of the potential market, the more rms will enter the eld, the more research leads each rm will pursue and the faster a product is likely to be developed. In light of the enormous health burden imposed by diseases such as malaria, it is important to provide sufcient incentives for multiple researchers to enter the eld and to induce major pharmaceutical rms to pursue many avenues of research simultaneously so that vaccines can be developed quickly. In other words, the more sponsors are willing to commit to pay, the greater will be the likely number of rms, the larger those rms' investments and the faster the development of a vac - cine. Even though we cannot reliably predict how much faster a vaccine would be developed as a result of increased investments, both evidence and theory tell us that total commercial invest - ments would be expected to rise with the increase in expected market size. 1 We decided to calibrate the appropriate value for each advance market commitment by looking at the net present value of sales revenues of existing commercial products, the expected sales of which clearly motivated biotech and pharmaceutical companies to invest in the past. The most recent comprehensive data on sales revenues for pharmaceutical products look at 118 new medicines introduced in the United States between 1990 and 1994.2 Our analysis uses this sales revenue data and nds that the average net present value of lifetime sales revenue for products in that sample is $3.1 billion (in 2004 dollars).3 Vaccine suppliers would earn some revenues from sources other than sales under the purchase commitment. For a malaria vac - cine effective against the form of malaria endemic to Africa there would be sales to travelers and the military, and to the private sector in poor countries. We estimate that the net present value of purchases in these markets would be about $850 million, so an advance market commitment would need to create a market of approximately $2.3 billion in expected revenue to create total expected revenues of $3.1 billion. 4 Note that this is not an estimate of the cost of R&D for a new vaccine. It is simply an approximate measure of the realized sales revenues of the average of a sample of products whose expected sales were sufcient to spur R&D investments from pharmaceuti - cal companies in the past. We therefore conclude that an advance market commitment offering total market revenues of about $3.1 billion (as a net present value) could be expected to stimulate pharmaceutical companies to invest in R&D on a commercial basis. What price would guarantee a return of $3 billion? For a malaria vaccine, under fairly pessimistic assumptions on uptake rates, this might correspond to a commitment to pay $15 (in today's prices) for each of the rst 200 million people immu - nized under the program. CGD PM51 $3 billion per disease 5Other combinations of price and quantity are possible. A lower price, with a correspondingly higher maximum quantity to which the guarantee applies, would create a smaller degree of front-loading of the return. This might be preferable to the extent that the rst product to market is likely to be imperfect, and it is important to create incentives for improved products. Some rms that we spoke to suggested a flexible pricing mecha - nism (such as cost plus some mark-up) instead of trying to set a price in advance. The rationale for this is that it is difcult to predict which technologies will succeed and thus to anticipate the cost of production. Firms could be sheltered from some of this risk through cost-plus pricing, albeit with a corresponding increase in the risk to sponsors. But this approach would reduce incentives to develop products that could be produced cheaply or to develop inexpensive manufacturing processes\u2014and it might add uncertainty to the commitment. Moreover, if a product were too expensive, it would not be a cost-effective use of a sponsor's funds to purchase it. For simplicity, the term sheets include a simple cost-plus formula, subject to a cap. What price is worth paying for vaccines? Developing countries\u2014and donors on their behalf\u2014currently pay less than $0.50 a dose for most vaccines. This has the advan - tage of reducing the cost to highly stretched health budgets. But as set out in chapter 1, it means that the introduction of new vaccines to poor countries is signicantly delayed and that there is insufcient incentive to develop new vaccines for diseases in developing countries. Some of the most signicant benets of an advance mar - ket commitment would come from enhancing the size and pre - dictability of the market, by committing to pay a price for new medicines that meets the cost of innovation. In fact, a guaranteed price considerably higher than pennies-per-dose would still be highly cost-effective relative to other health, and other develop - ment, policies. We used malaria as an example to illustrate the orders of mag - nitude involved. Consider a commitment to purchase a malaria vaccine at a price of $15 (in today's prices) per person immunized for the rst 200 million people immunized. This commitment, together with estimated revenues from other markets, provides an expected return to developers of approximately $3.1 billion, com - parable to average revenue for commercial products as discussed above. In return for this revenue, the developers guarantee to sell subsequent treatments at $1 each. The cost-effectiveness of such a commitment would depend on a number of assumptions. These assumptions were employed for the example developed by the Working Group, and should be rened with additional analyses and consultations. To get an idea of the magnitudes, assume that: The contract covers all countries with a GNP of less than $1,000 a year with sufcient disease prevalence to make vaccination worthwhile (in terms of being cost effective at less than $100 per DALY saved; see box 3.1). Countries adopt the vaccine over seven years and eventu - ally attain a steady-state immunization level ve percentage points above that of the basic childhood immunization program. The vaccine requires three doses but could be delivered with the childhood immunization package at an incremental delivery cost of $0.75. The vaccine is 60% effective, protects against infection for ve years and does not lead to a rebound effect by weaken - ing limited natural immunity. Given these assumptions and data on population, fertility and disease prevalence, the cost\u2014including incremental delivery costs\u2014per DALY saved would be about $15 (discounted in 2004 dollars), making vaccine purchases under the program one of the world's most cost-effective health interventions.5 The value-for-money from such a program is robust to changes in assumptions about efcacy, uptake rates or the price offered. Furthermore, this is a highly conservative estimate of the pro - gram's cost-effectiveness. The calculation does not include epi - demiological benets\u2014vaccinating a signicant fraction of the population may slow the spread of a disease, and thus benets may spill over to the unvaccinated. It does not include savings to developing-country health systems from lower rates of illness and morbidity. It does not include health benets to people in middle- and high-income countries or benets to adults in low-income countries who purchase a vaccine privately. It assumes that the vaccine would be given randomly throughout a country and thus does not include the efciency benets of targeting vaccine delivery within countries to areas that have the most severe disease problems. Finally, it does not include any benets of increasing vaccination rates for other diseases that might arise CGD 0414.indd 51 4/14/05 1:32:09 PM52 $3 billion per disease 5if parents know they can vaccinate their children against malaria by bringing them to a clinic. These estimates demonstrate that, once a vaccine is developed, purchasing it at a price well above current prices paid for vaccines in developing countries would still be one of the most cost-effec - tive health interventions, more cost-effective than a wide range of other development expenditures. Is the commitment the right size? If an increase in the size of the commitment would accelerate development of a vaccine, is it worth making a commitment to a higher price or paying for a larger number of doses? For example, paying $17 per person for the rst 200 million people immunized rather than $15 per person would increase the over - all market size to $3.6 billion, comparable with the revenues for the average drug in the 70th to 80th percentile, at a cost of $16 per DALY saved. Or paying $25 per person immunized for the rst 250 million people immunized would increase the overall market size to $5.7 billion, comparable with the average drug in the 80th to 90th percentile of drug revenues, at a cost of about $23 per DALY saved. Either of these commitment sizes would create attractive markets for developers and still be cost-effective from a public health perspective. These calculations demonstrate that once a vaccine is devel - oped, purchasing a vaccine at the pre-specied price would be very cost-effective. A more complex issue is the value of a com - mitment in accelerating the development and distribution of a vaccine, which requires assumptions about what would happen in the absence of a commitment. We estimate that if a vaccine purchase commitment advanced vaccine development by 10 years and accelerated access in poor countries by 10 years, it would cost only about $23 per additional DALY saved. Even in the extreme case in which a price commitment accelerated vaccine develop - ment by only one year and adoption in poor countries by only two years, the program would cost about $80-90 per additional DALY saved\u2014still less than the $100 per DALY cost-effectiveness threshold for the poorest countries. Hence under a large range of assumptions and contract structures, a vaccine commitment could be priced at a level likely sufcient to stimulate substantial private R&D, yet still be cost-effective from a public health and donor perspective. A commitment of $15-25 for each of the rst 200-250 mil - lion people immunized would be a bargain in terms of public health cost-effectiveness. Within this range larger commitments would be expected to lead to more rms to enter the search for a vaccine and shorten the expected time to development and distribution. Cost-effectiveness of an advance market commitment for HIV and tuberculosis vaccines A spreadsheet model (available for download from the Center for Global Development website at www.cgdev.org/vaccine) allows users to analyze a large number of different scenarios and estimate the costs and benets of commitments for malaria, tuberculosis and HIV vaccines under a variety of assumptions, such as about delivery costs, uptake, disease burden and eligibility.6 Appendix E gives a short overview of the spreadsheet. We present here estimates produced by this spreadsheet model under a set of conservative benchmark assumptions. Although we have used the example of malaria throughout this report, the spreadsheet estimates similar degrees of cost-effectiveness for commitments to purchase vaccines for tuberculosis or HIV (table 5.1). Note that additional analytic work would be required to rene the estimates. Malaria has a particularly low cost per DALY because the burden of disease is highly geographically concentrated in Africa and hence it would be possible to economize on delivery costs by targeting the vaccine. However, given that the burden of disease from tuberculosis and HIV is estimated to exceed that of malaria, Table 5.1 Cost-effectiveness of an advance market commitment of $3.1 billion DiseaseEstimated cost per DALY would be less than . . Malaria $15 HIV PM53 $3 billion per disease 5the cost per DALY alone should not be the sole determinant of policy priorities. The International AIDS Vaccine Initiative and the Malaria Vaccine Initiative are both conducting more detailed investiga - tions of the appropriate parameters for an advance market com - mitment for a vaccine for each of those diseases, with the aim of making recommendations for how the commitment should be tailored to the circumstances of those diseases. CGD 0414.indd 53 4/14/05 4/14/05 1:32:10 PMChapter at a glance We have sought to design a mechanism to which industry will respond by increasing R&D on vaccines for diseases occurring mainly in developing countries. Industry is attracted to the concept of payment for results; the market mechanism ts their business model well and preserves the role of intellectual property rights and market sales nancing commercial investment in pharmaceutical R&D. Our consultations revealed a range of priorities for the commitment from different parts of industry. An advance market commitment would be of value to developing-country suppliers, which often do not benet from other incentive arrangements. Complementary measures are needed to improve the procurement of existing vaccines, improve demand forecasts and increase funding for existing drugs and vaccines. CGD 0414.indd 55 4/14/05 1:32:10 PM56 Meeting industry requirements 6A range of industry requirements The success of the advance market commitment depends on creating effective incentives for potential vaccine developers and suppliers who see a scientic potential to invest. The program is intended to create incentives to accelerate the development of new vaccines, but the details of the design may make a sig - nicant difference to the incentives that the contract creates. Critical determinants of success include the size of the reward, the contractual requirements placed on the rm (for example, the eligibility requirements) and the public relations impact of participation. We have borne in mind that our goal is not to encourage all rms to work on these products. It is to accelerate the develop - ment of a vaccine by providing sufcient incentive for some rms to begin R&D on these problems, and for others to devote extra resources and priority to their existing work. Initial research often is done by biotech companies. Typically, their work is then either licensed to, or bought by, larger pharma - ceutical companies for the later stages of development, marketing and manufacturing. An important ingredient in the proposal is that it should generate a response from biotechs and other early-stage researchers\u2014for example, by creating a sufcient market for the vaccine to give them condence that pharmaceutical companies will invest in intermediate research outputs. Biotech companies and venture capitalists would be more willing to invest because they would be more condent that they would attract interest from pharmaceutical companies for the products they develop. There is considerable evidence that rms do, in fact, respond to market signals by adjusting their R&D to reflect the size of the potential market. 1 The only way to know for sure how rms would react is to implement a commitment and observe what happens. In the meantime, it is possible to obtain information through structured consultations with informed individuals, particularly those who are currently facing difcult choices about where to invest in R&D to yield the best outcome for shareholders. We consulted representatives of three industry groups\u2014biotechnology rms of various sizes and orientations, multinational vaccine manufactur - ers and emerging market suppliers (box 6.1). We sought feedback on the overall concept and tried to identify specic ways in which the advance contract concept could be structured to most likely generate a change in investment behavior. The results of these discussions, summarized here, were invaluable for developing our recommendations. Our aim has been to design a commitment that creates the right commercial incentives to encourage industry to invest, while ensuring value for money for sponsors. The industry is diverse Firms had various reactions to the idea of an advance commit - ment, depending on their risk tolerance, product pipeline, scien - tic background and business model. There was a greater degree of consistency within industry categories, but even within these categories each rm indicated a unique character and strategic agenda. For example, pharmaceutical companies with vaccines coming to market soon were more interested in commitments for late-stage products than were biotechs engaged in research on early-stage products. Many rms expressed a view that an advance market com - mitment, if structured in the right way, would be exactly what they needed to make the case for keeping global health products in the development pathway. Others felt there was little com - mercial motivation that could stimulate a dramatic change in their research pipelines. Although some have interpreted advance market commitments to be targeted at multinational rms, emerging suppliers from developing countries would also have the potential to benet. Unlike some incentives that would benet primarily large and protable pharmaceutical companies (U.S. tax credits, transfer - able patents), all rms would be in a position to compete for the market offered by this commitment.

In addition, the Working Group spoke with several for - mer senior industry executives. CGD 0414.indd 56 4/14/05 1:32:10 PM57 Meeting industry requirements 6India, Indonesia and elsewhere that have demonstrated the capac - ity to achieve tremendous scale efciencies of production could participate through joint ventures or other types of partnerships with rms that have a strong tradition of innovation. Key industry requirements Some themes emerged from the consultations. A commitment is likely to have more impact on some rms than others. For products at an early stage, for example, an advance market commitment may initially motivate biotech companies and the venture capitalists that provide their funding, while some larger multinational pharmaceutical rms may get involved only after further advances in the science, perhaps led by biotech rms. For many rms the establishment of a signicant nancial reward for the successful developer would be important in within-rm analysis and in negotiations about which products to move ahead with and at what pace. These rms cited in particular the moments in the development pathway when relatively costly decisions are taken to test products in humans. Some respondents indicated that an advance market com - mitment would address industry concerns about the appro - priation of intellectual property and the downward pres - sure on prices that occurs when an essential medicine is developed but is seen as unaffordable to the developing world. Commercial decisions to develop a particular candidate are based on market prospects but also\u2014critically\u2014on science. Access to a promising scientic pathway will be the primary determinant of some rms' investment deci - sions in early research. There was a wide range of opinions about the challenges of developing a malaria vaccine, for example, and some rms reported that they are unwilling to invest given the current state of science. The public sec - tor will need to keep investing in basic research and lead development to advance the science. Firms do not evaluate incentives independently but look at the comprehensive picture of risks and rewards they will face through the development process. An advance market commitment, or indeed any similar mechanism focused on creating incentives for commercial investment, would need to be implemented in coordination with other interventions\u2014push funding, demand creation and capacity-building for distribution and delivery. Weaknesses in the current system of procurement and deliv - ery of vaccines for the developing world are a major deterrent to investment. Most rms supplying developing-country markets through public procurement are frustrated with inefciencies in the current system\u2014short-term purchase agreements, the lack of enforceable contracts, unreliable demand forecasts and underuse of existing vaccines. The public sector can improve its credibility by increasing use of existing products and by improving demand forecasts. The credibility of the commitment is closely related to the credibility of the sponsor. Citing real-world examples, rms were not convinced of the public sector's ability to live up to its funding promises that are not legally binding. Firms indicated that the inclusion of a private foundation as sponsors would add enormously to the credibility of the proposal. It was therefore clear from the consultations that it would be essential for an advance market commitment to be legally binding on the sponsors, and that nonbinding statements of intent would not elicit the same response. Given the novelty of the advance market commitment for the public sector, industry will be most persuaded by suc - cessful execution. Firms expressed uniform enthusiasm for implementing long-term contracts for late-stage (and existing) products. In addition to being directly benecial by increasing affordable access to those vaccines, this would build up the credibility of similar commitments for early-stage products. We have looked carefully at each of these industry consider - ations and sought to ensure that our advance market proposal takes these concerns into account. Firms also gave specic feed - back on the proposed structure of advance contracts, particularly the Framework Agreement and Guarantee Agreement. These points have been taken into account in the advance market pro - posal set out in chapters 3 and 4 and are reflected in the discus - sion in those chapters. CGD 0414.indd 57 4/14/05 1:32:11 0414.indd 58 4/14/05 1:32:11 PMChapter at a glance Government sponsors can make legally binding commitments\u2014and do so all the time. Private sponsors can too, and their involvement would add to the credibility of the commitment. The commitment can be handled within existing government budget processes. Under normal accounting rules for the sponsors included in the analysis, there is no cost to sponsors until and unless a vaccine is developed. There is no short-term budgetary tradeoff with existing funding of R&D. Existing procurement and regulatory arrangements can be used. An advance market commitment will require the sponsors to enter into an agreement, enforceable by law, to make multiyear payments of uncertain size and duration (though with a known upper limit) to an unknown recipient at some unknown time in the future. Can sponsors, as matter of practical fact, make a commitment of this sort? We looked at whether there are any institutional or legal obstacles to making commitments and how such commitments would be treated in the budget process. We found that there are no obstacles to sponsors making this commitment. CGD 0414.indd 59 4/14/05 1:32:12 PM60 How sponsors can do it 7Possible government sponsors The United States We start with the United States because its budgetary process is more complicated than that of other possible sponsors. The starting point is that the U.S. government enters long- term contracts as a matter of course. An administration is able to enter legal agreements that bind its successors. The govern - ment has budgeting mechanisms to authorize and deliver multi-year funding streams in the future. These obligations are legally binding and credible in markets even in the face of a degree of uncertainty about the appropriations process. Indeed, U.S. law specically waives U.S. sovereign immunity for contracts executed by the United States in its proprietary capacity. An example of a legally binding government commitment is the sale of government bonds, contracts that oblige the government to pay money to bondholders in the future. The U.S. government faces no legal difculty making such commitments, even though they bind successor administrations. To enter a contractual commitment to buy vaccines in the future, the administration needs specic authority from Con - gress. Once that legal authority exists, the mechanics of signing a legally binding commitment are uncomplicated. A U.S. government commitment to purchase vaccines, even one that is legally binding, would not score as government expen - diture, or contribute to the government decit, until the vaccine is produced and purchased. Until then, the commitment remains a long-term liability and (depending on the perceived probability of the vaccine being developed) would be included in long-term projections of outlays. But for the administration to sign the contract, it would need approval from Congress, and the measure granting this approval would score against the congressional appropriations ceiling within which budgets are set. If other budget lines had to be reduced to accommodate a commitment within a xed appropriations ceiling, the commit - ment would require changes elsewhere in the budget: current programs, delivering certain and immediate benets, would have to be reduced to make way for the uncertain future benets of the advance markets commitment. Such an approach would be unlikely to command political support.But with sufcient political will, this can be overcome within the U.S. budget framework. One practical approach is for the authorizing legislation to be made outside the appropriations process, for example, by the Energy and Commerce Committee. In the best case, the congressional budget plan would explic - itly accommodate the budget authority needed for the program. This might be reasonably straightforward to agree, because the budget authority needed for that committee would not compete with the authority needed for the Appropriations Committee, and the expenditure authorized would have no impact on outlay projections (over the time horizon of the projections) or on the decit. Even if Congress did not include the advance market com - mitment in the budget, the Energy and Commerce Committee could seek approval for the legislation later in the year. By bringing the legislation outside the Appropriations Committee, the focus of attention would be on the impact on the outlay projections (none), not on the budget authority needed. And congressional leadership might well agree to waive the budget ceilings in this instance. There are other possible approaches to securing budget authority for the necessary legislation without competing with other more immediate spending priorities. If the Appropria - tions Committee felt that, for reasons of precedent, it would be preferable for the authority to be provided by an appropriations bill, Congress could budget for a one-off, ring-fenced bulge in the appropriations ceiling to accommodate the commitment. Given that the commitment would have no impact on outlay or decit projections, a one-off change to the appropriations ceiling to accommodate the commitment would be relatively easy to defend. We conclude that the treatment in the U.S. budget system is not straightforward, and approval will depend on there being sufcient political support for the proposal. But we also believe that this is a policy with broad bipartisan appeal, and that with some political leadership, it could secure the commitment neces - sary to navigate the budget process. We are clear, however, that if there is political support for the idea, there is no technical obstacle that would prevent the U.S. government from making a long-term advance market commitment. CGD 0414.indd 60 4/14/05 1:32:12 PM61 How sponsors can do it 7The United Kingdom The U.K. government, through the Department for International Development (DFID), could commit to an advance market within its existing budget mechanisms. While there is no precedent in DFID for making legally bind - ing commitments to procure products that do not yet exist, it has implemented innovative nancing approaches that have similar characteristics. Examples include trust funds, endowments and provisions for guarantees, as well as statements of intent to pro - vide long-term funding support for country programs. DFID has issued guarantees to a company operating on a capital aid project to meet the costs of certain disputed claims (\u00a330 million). Other contingent liabilities on the books include the United Kingdom's share of callable capital at the International Bank for Reconstruc - tion and Development ( \u20ac5.5 billion) and government guarantees to international nancial institutions for U.K. loans to dependent territories (\u00a32.4 billion). The International Development Act of 2002 empowered the Secretary of State to use \"non-grant nancial instruments includ - ing guarantees\" in pursuit of the department's objectives. No further specic legislative authority is required for DFID to enter a commitment of the kind envisaged for an advance market. An advance market commitment in the U.K. budget The scoring of expenditure in the U.K. budget is intended to closely follow private sector accounting rules. Under U.K. accounting rules, as set out in FRS 12,1 the advance market com - mitment would be deemed to be an executory contract (that is, a contract in which both parties have not yet fully performed their obligations). Under FRS 12, obligations under contracts to make or take future supplies of goods and services do not normally need to be included on the balance sheet, and so do not give rise to contingent liabilities or require the body to take a provision. The main exception is an \"onerous contract,\" in which the unavoidable costs of meeting the obligations under it exceed the economic benets expected to be received from it. As seen in chap - ter 5, the economic benets of the advance market commitment exceed the cost, so the commitment is not onerous and would not require DFID to include a contingent liability or provision in the balance sheet.Because an advance market commitment would not have to be included on the department's balance sheet, there would be no need to make budgetary provision at the time the commitment was made, and there would be no short-term cost for DFID. If and when a vaccine was available and spending actually occurred, DFID would be required to meet the costs from within its budget granted by parliament. For a given expenditure limit, this would require lower spending elsewhere. (This is discussed in the box on budgetary tradeoffs later in this chapter.) The U.K. government has chosen to base its overall scal framework, including targets for spending and the decit, on national accounts measures. The expenditure would not be recorded in the U.K. national accounts until the government was actually buying vaccines. Other governments We have not looked in detail at the arrangements for other gov - ernments, but we believe that the main donor countries could, if they chose, make an advance market commitment consistent with their normal legal and budgetary processes. The World Bank The International Development Association (IDA) of the World Bank, which provides subsidized loans and grants, could in prin - ciple also be a sponsor of an advance market commitment.2 But the normal operation of World Bank lending would need to be modied. Forward commitment Sponsors would need to make a legally binding commitment, perhaps 10 or more years in advance of the likely spending. But the priorities for IDA loans and grants are usually set only over a ve-year time horizon, and the World Bank has been reluctant to earmark specic sums for specic programs. There does not appear to be any legal impediment to the World Bank's legally binding itself to provide IDA loans or grants to any member state that wants to purchase the vaccine under the advance market commitment. This would, however, be a departure from current practice\u2014and may be thought to set unwelcome precedents for earmarking. However, in principle this would be a commitment different in character from other CGD 0414.indd 61 4/14/05 1:32:12 PM62 How sponsors can do it 7earmarking proposals, because it is a contract to buy specic goods in the future, and so it may be possible to prevent it from setting a more general precedent. Loans or grants? IDA loans, which are at below-market rates, carry an implicit subsidy of roughly 60%.3 Since the bulk of the expense of purchas - ing the vaccine represents the cost of research and development, which is a global public good, it is appropriate for these costs to be met from grants rather than the 40% co-payment by devel - oping countries implicit in IDA terms. This could be achieved through IDA if the World Bank were to increase the subsidy on the loans (reduce recipient countries' co-payment) by offsetting part of the vaccine purchase price through grants. Alternatively, other donors\u2014either private foundations or gov - ernments\u2014could make a commitment to \"buy down\" IDA loans used to purchase vaccine. In other words, they could give the mem - ber money to repay the loan\u2014as for Nigeria's polio eradication campaign. One particularly attractive element of this buy-down approach is that governments or private foundations could deposit promissory notes with a World Bank trust fund now but would not need to make payments until appropriate vaccines were devel - oped and IDA loans were extended for purchases. Where national budgeting rules are amenable, the commitment would not count toward government outlays until the funds were drawn. Additionality For the commitment to be effective, the World Bank would need to agree in advance that IDA loans and grants for purchasing vac - cines under the advance market commitment would be additional to the IDA allocation for the country using them. Otherwise, since countries are restricted in the value of IDA credits they can use in a single year, it is possible that developing countries would be reluctant to purchase vaccines, since this would use up a portion of their IDA allocation, which they might need for other purposes. At present, all IDA is allocated to country programs. There is no procedure to set aside funds for global public goods. To ensure that IDA funding of purchases under an advance market com - mitment was genuinely additional, it would be necessary if and when a vaccine is developed to set aside some funds that were not taken from country allocations. Again, while there is no precedent for this, there are no legal obstacles to doing so.Foundations Given that the advance market commitment is a straightforward contract, there are no legal or budgetary obstacles that would prevent private foundations from making an advance market commitment. The budgetary implications for an endowment-based foundation are a bit different from the considerations for a government with indenite tax revenues. An advance market commitment represents a claim on a portion of the endowment, which means that the money cannot also be spent in another way. But foundations invest the majority of their principal in any case. This principal, invested to earn a return for the foundation, would also serve as the asset underpinning the commitment\u2014in effect, the foundation can put the same funds to work twice in the interests of the poor. In the short run, before a vaccine is available, and provided that the foundation's total commitment is less than the principal that the foundation plans to invest in any case, this commitment would have no effect on the foundation's revenue or expenditures. If and when the vaccine is produced, the foundation will, as a result of the commitment, be required to make co-payments toward the vaccine purchase. At this stage, the foundation may choose to divert spending from other priorities (especially where it expects to make savings as a result of the availability of the vaccine\u2014as for the purchase of drugs or investment in R&D), to cut lower priority programs or to increase its total spending. Some foundations have a policy against using resources to pay for current goods and services and to avoid undertaking open- ended commitments to meet current costs that should be the obligation of governments. The combination of the dual-price structure and co-payments by developing countries in the advance market commitment means that the donors' contributions cor - respond to the incentives for commercial investment in R&D and the cost of scaling up large-scale production. The marginal cost of production of the vaccine, which foundations may as a matter of policy not wish to fund, is accounted for by the devel - oping countries' co-payments. So although the contract takes the form of the purchase of vaccines, because that is the best way to create the right incentives for effective and well targeted R&D, the contribution of donors is conceptually meeting the cost of the R&D and subsidizing scaling up production. It is therefore quite unlike making an open-ended and unsustainable commitment to meet future vaccine costs. CGD 0414.indd 62 4/14/05 1:32:13 PM63 How sponsors can do it 7It would be particularly benecial to the credibility of the advance market program for private foundations to be sponsors or co-sponsors of the commitment because: They have greater continuity of leadership and strategic focus, so they are perceived as less likely to change direction. They may be perceived to be less vulnerable to lobbying from special interest groups. They have a substantial asset base and no ability to legislate away their obligations, so their commitment is regarded as highly reliable. The Global Alliance on Vaccines and Immunization and the Vaccine Fund The mandate of the Global Alliance on Vaccines and Immunization The Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization (GAVI) is an alliance between the private and public sector, with the mission of saving children's lives and protecting people's health through the widespread use of vaccines. GAVI brings together governments in developing and industrialized countries, established and emerging vaccine manufacturers, nongovernmental organizations, research institutes, the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), the World Health Organization, the Bill & Melinda Gates Founda - tion and the World Bank. GAVI has a unique role in increasing resources allocated to the purchase and use of vaccines and in improving the way those resources are used. It focuses on areas in which no one partner can work alone effectively and to add value to what partners are already doing. GAVI's added value has been dened in four areas: Coordination and consensus-building. Funding support to countries, through the Vaccine Fund. Resources are provided to countries to purchase vaccines and other supplies and to support the operational costs of immunization. Innovation\u2014examples include the country proposal and review process, performance-based grants for immunization services support, nancial sustainability planning, the Data Quality Audit, Vaccine Provision Project and Accelerated Development and Introduction Plans. Advocacy and communications\u2014particularly to inform decisionmaking among policymakers and donors on the value of vaccination for reducing poverty and infant mor - tality in the developing world. There is a strong t between these four areas and the goals of an advance market commitment. Given their mandates, GAVI and the Vaccine Fund are natural partners in an advance market commit - ment. In particular, GAVI, or an alliance of members under its aus - pices, might be an appropriate forum for donors to reach a consensus about the approach, and agree on the details of the commitment. Commitments might then be made by donors directly or through guarantees to the Vaccine Fund, which is a member of GAVI. The Vaccine Fund could become a sponsor of an advance market commitment, if it were underwritten by its donors to do so. Given the role of the Vaccine Fund in buying vaccines, there would be advantages in structuring nancial arrangements to enable it to enter into advance market commitments. Depending on budgetary constraints on the part of the donors, this might take the form of direct nancing or suitable (legally binding) guarantees from donors\u2014for example, through the International Finance Facility for Immunization (IFFIm) initiative. The International Finance Facility The U.K. Treasury has proposed an International Finance Facility (IFF) to accelerate progress toward the Millennium Development Goals by issuing bonds on international markets. If established, the IFF would: Create a nancing mechanism that would provide up to an additional $50 billion a year in development assistance until 2015. Lever additional money from the international capital mar - kets by issuing bonds based on legally binding long-term donor commitments. Repay bondholders using future donor payment streams. Disburse resources through existing multilateral and bilat - eral mechanisms. The IFF proposal has generated interest and support from emerg - ing markets, developing countries, international institutions, faith communities, nongovernmental organizations and businesses. The International Finance Facility for Immunization initiative There are discussions among DFID, the U.K. Treasury and GAVI to consider options for piloting the IFF approach through the CGD 0414.indd 63 4/14/05 1:32:13 PM64 How sponsors can do it 7Vaccine Fund. A Working Group, including the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, GAVI and the Vaccine Fund, is looking at the technical case for this approach. IFFIm is intended to create a framework in which: Donor funding for vaccines over the next 15 years is planned. On the strength of these plans, the initiative is able to program spending over a 10-year horizon. Funding for vaccines is therefore better planned, more predictable and delivered sooner. There are several arguments for front-loading spending on vaccines in the way implied by using IFFIm: Having a quicker impact on immunization, thus reducing child mortality, reducing the burden of disease and accel - erating economic growth. Providing incentives for vaccine producers to invest in production facilities and to develop new vaccines through greater market certainty or a short-term price top-up to allow producers to cover development costs earlier. Accelerating of new products through R&D and trials for new vaccines. Developing health systems with long-term capacity benets. In principle, these characteristics would enable the initiative to secure greater value with the same amount of donor funds, compared with the existing situation of allocating funds from one year to the next. Using IFFIm to implement an advance market commitment Like the advance market proposal, IFFIm is based on the idea that by increasing certainty about their future behavior, donors can increase the productivity of their spending. The market for vaccines would be more efcient, providing vaccines to more people at a lower cost, if there were greater certainty of demand, which is presently hampered by unpredictable funding. A more reliable market would enable rms to invest more at every stage of the process, from scientic research, through clinical trials, to investment in production capacity. This would result in new vaccines becoming available more quickly and larger volumes being available more cheaply. Because it will generate committed funding over 10 years, funds from IFFIm could implement an advance market commitment for new vaccines, such as for rotavirus and pneumococcus.It might not be appropriate, however, for IFFIm to make a long-term legally binding commitment to vaccines not likely to be available over the next 10 years, as this will be outside its lifespan. There is thus a strong case for a group of donors to make a sepa - rate legally binding advance market commitment for vaccines for such diseases as malaria, tuberculosis and HIV, in addition to the proposed commitment to purchasing vaccines through IFFIm. An advance market commitment as a complementary nancing mechanism for IFFIm The IFFIm nancial mechanism requires donors to provide pledges to a nancial vehicle, which on the strength of those pledges can borrow in nancial markets to rephase and commit that spending. But because of constraints on budget processes, nancial accounting or limitations on legal powers, some donors may not be able to make a pledge of this kind. The advance market commitment is a different kind of arrange - ment, taking the form of a long-term procurement contract. Most governments have ways to make long-term commitments of this kind, and there are budgetary procedures for this. It is there - fore possible that some donors that could not contribute directly through the IFFIm nancial mechanism would be able to make an advance market commitment for the purchase of vaccines such as rotavirus and pneumococcus. These commitments could then be taken into account in the overall planning of IFFIm. This provides an alternative way for donors to contribute to the overall IFFIm initiative, even if they are not yet able to contribute through the nancial mechanism (gure 7.1 and box 7.1). Would sponsors pay twice? Some sponsors with signicant portfolios of direct funding of R&D may be concerned that they would end up \"paying twice\" for R&D on new vaccines: rst, when they support R&D and basic science and again when they pay for vaccines under the advance market commitment. This concern can usefully be put in context. First, the United States and other countries routinely support R&D through pub - lic sector and philanthropic programs, and accept that products that benet from that investment will later be purchased at above marginal cost through Medicare and other public insurance programs. Second, the vast majority of the spending under the CGD 0414.indd 64 4/14/05 1:32:14 PM65 How sponsors can do it 7advance market commitment\u2014such as late-stage clinical trials, commercial development, regulatory approval through licensure and investments in large-scale productive capacity\u2014currently receives very little support through push-funding mechanisms. So while the advance market commitment would stimulate some R&D in basic science and identication of candidates, the bulk of the revenues from an advance market commitment will cover costs that were incurred on activities that are, for the most part, outside the current scope of push funding. Moreover, the size of the advance market commitment can be set to reflect the extent of the contribution that is being made by push-funded R&D. However, to the extent that there is duplication, in princi - ple it would be possible to structure either push funding or the advance market commitment to prevent double payment. In practice, it would be very difcult to change the advance mar - ket payout according to the origins of the original investment, as this would: Require the Independent Adjudication Committee to col - lect information about the costs, funding and institutional and intellectual heritage of qualifying products that they would not otherwise have or need. Introduce a considerable element of discretion into the oper - ation of the advance market commitment\u2014which would lead to a level of uncertainty that could greatly diminish rms' interest in investing. Distort the market for products once they are developed: in particular, sponsors might be inclined to encourage pur - chase of an inferior product just because it would incur a lower payout as a result of having had more push funding in the past; this would create a bias that might undermine the incentive to buy the best available vaccines when they are available. By contrast, it might be quite straightforward to adapt push funding arrangements for the existence of an advance market commitment. For example, funders of research could explicitly take the existence of an advance market commitment into consid - eration when negotiating upfront support or milestone payments. This is done now for development of some products, when there Figure 7.1 Possible relationship between the International Finance Facility for Immunization initiative and advance market commitment CGD 0414.indd 65 4/14/05 1:32:15 PM66 How sponsors can do it 7If sponsors make an advance market commitment, will they need to make corresponding reductions else - where, for example in their direct support for R&D? An advance market commitment would increase commercial investment in R&D, which in turn would increase the productivity of existing and future do - nor and philanthropic investments in R&D, for at least two reasons. First, there would be a larger and better-resourced scientic community working on the issues, which would benet everyone engaged in that research. Second, there would be a much higher chance that scientic breakthroughs resulting from these investments will be followed through into the actual development and production of vaccines that deliver health benets, increasing the value of the origi - nal investment. Given these complementarities, which increase the cost-effectiveness of push funding, an advance market commitment might make donors and foundations more likely to want to increase resources flowing in to push funding. Resources are nite. However, in the short term, there is no need for a sponsor making an advance mar - ket commitment to reduce other spending because: Making an advance market commitment has no im - pact on government spending measures (because payments will be measured only when the goods and services are delivered, even if the commitment is legally binding); in the United States, where the commitment would fall within the appropriations ceiling, we have proposed ways in which the com - mitment could be made without reducing the funds that are appropriated for other foreign assistance priorities. For private foundations, the commitment repre - sents a claim on the foundation's assets, but does not directly reduce resources available for spending today. (Indeed, most private foundations would not be able to reduce current spending, because of the rule that they must spend 5% of their principal each year.)a In the long term, however, when a vaccine is devel - oped, the commitment will clearly require the spon - sors to make payments, using funds that could oth - erwise have been used elsewhere. To the extent that the commitment represents additional net spending, other lower priority spending will have to be reduced to accommodate this. However, the effect of the com - mitment on future budget allocations is likely to be considerably less than the headline $3 billion commit - ment, for three reasons: Sponsors would almost certainly spend signicant sums buying a vaccine when it is developed anyway, even in the absence of making a commitment; this means the net cost of making a commitment is only the additional price paid under the guarantee compared with what would be charged without it. To the extent that the price paid initially under an advance market commitment is higher than donors normally pay for vaccines, the corollary is perma - nently lower, sustainable vaccine prices more quickly, as guaranteed by the producers under the advance market contract; thus the total fu - ture expected costs of buying vaccines may not be much higher than without a commitment; and their obligation will be strictly limited, unlike the present situation. The rapid development, production and distribution of vaccines would be likely to save considerable costs elsewhere in development budgets (such as purchasing of drugs, health care costs, R&D on these diseases), further reducing the net costs to donors. This means that, while there is a long-term cost to the commitment that will have to be accommodated Box 7.1 Is there a budgetary tradeoff? CGD 0414.indd 66 4/14/05 1:32:15 PM67 How sponsors can do it 7is a recognition that there might be a middle-income market. Moreover, funders could, if they choose, make it a condition of their grants that they receive a portion of intellectual property royalties received by institutions they fund. This is an area that merits further analysis than was possible within the context of the Working Group. Regulatory and procurement systems Existing procurement systems Current procurement and regulatory systems for developing world vaccines depend heavily, though not exclusively, on the WHO and UNICEF. While some large countries\u2014such as China, India and Indonesia\u2014produce and buy their own vaccines, UNICEF and the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) Revolving Fund are the primary agents of vaccine procurement for develop - ing countries. And for Vaccine Fund-eligible countries, UNICEF is the largest global procurement system. UNICEF and the Revolving Fund purchase only vaccines that are \"pre-qualied\" by the WHO, the ofcial body advising UN agencies on the suitability of specic vaccine products for purchase. 4 Not only do UN agencies purchase only products on the WHO pre-qualied list, but many countries in the develop - ing world also use it as a basis for their own product licensing and selection.UNICEF supplies vaccines to 40% of the world's children. It works with governments to estimate needs for specic vaccines and immunization supplies, based on existing immunization program coverage, birth rates, expected availability of funds and other factors. It then aggregates those estimates over countries for each type of product and issues tenders through an international competitive bidding process. In negotiating with suppliers, factors taken into account include prices and a rm's track record for quality and reliability; when possible, UNICEF also considers different suppliers of the same product, to maintain a competi - tive supply environment. On the nancing side, UNICEF maintains accounts that are funded by individual donors, such as bilateral aid agencies, as well as national governments. It then matches the available funding for a given country to the products procured. UNICEF facilitates delivery of products in-country, with UNICEF staff often helping to ensure that the products make it safely through customs and to appropriate storage depots. In 2002 UNICEF purchased $220 million worth of vaccines for use in 100 countries, representing 2 billion doses of vaccines.5 The UNICEF procurement process has six steps: the decision to purchase a vaccine, development of specications, identication of products meeting specications (through WHO prequalication), publication of the tender, the adjudication and award process and receipt and release of the vaccine products.Box 7.1 (continued) Is there a budgetary tradeoff? within future spending plans, the size of the additional spending that has to be accommodated as a result of the commitment is much less than it rst appears. Depending on the nature of the donor's other spending plans and commitments, the net effect on the donor's budget in the future may be quite small. Furthermore, as shown in chapter 5, the expenditure to which the sponsor is committed is highly cost-effective, saving millions of lives at very low cost. In conclusion, one of the attractive features of an advance market commitment for potential sponsors is that there is no cash outlay until a vaccine is developed and used. This means that, in the short term, there is no direct budgetary pressure to reduce other spend - ing when a commitment is made. On the contrary, a commitment would enhance the cost-effectiveness of current government and philanthropic funding by facilitating the more active engagement of the private sector, and by helping to turn research ndings into useful products. a. This is not true of public charities\u2014which have a diverse funding base\u2014such as the Vaccine Fund. CGD 0414.indd 67 4/14/05 1:32:15 PM68 How sponsors can do it 7Most of the countries of Latin America and the Caribbean procure their vaccines through the PAHO Revolving Fund, which began operation in 1979, to ensure a reliable supply of vaccines for the region's immunization programs. PAHO in-country Expanded Programme of Immunization (EPI) advisors work with staff of the national immunization pro - gram to prepare orders on a periodic basis for specic vaccines and immunization supplies. Those requests are then aggregated at PAHO headquarters, which prepares tenders, negotiates prices, delivery dates and other contractual obligations and executes con - tracts. Payment is made to suppliers from the Revolving Fund. Then, when the products are delivered in-country, countries repay the Revolving Fund so that it is replenished for the next procurement round. The Revolving Fund has been effective in coordinating procure - ment, increasing certainty for manufacturers and reducing prices. The number of countries participating has grown from 19 in 1979 to 34 in 2003; and the capitalization of the fund has grown from the original $1 million in 1979 to $20 million in 2003. The need for long-term contracting During our discussions, it became clear that industry attaches a great deal of importance to the further development and wide - spread use of binding, enforceable, long-term contracts for vac - cines for developing countries. UNICEF's usual procurement award for most commodities is a \"long-term arrangement.\" Under a long-term arrangement, UNICEF and manufacturers agree to the commercial terms for products, such as prices, delivery schedules and packing require - ments, so that when an order is placed, it can be delivered rapidly. Past long-term arrangements have typically had a duration of one to two years, but they can last as long as ve years. UNICEF also provides the vaccine industry with forecasts for vaccine require - ments (in three- or four-year increments), but these are indicative only (that is, they do not form an enforceable contract). The challenge UNICEF faces is compounded by the fact that it is buying vaccines for 100 countries each year and that it is constrained by public sector purchasing regulations. The procure - ment decision for such a large number of countries, and making up such a large part of the market, creates a different relationship between buyer and sellers than would a procurement contract for a single country.During our industry consultations, the point was made repeatedly and forcefully that the lack of binding contracts, and particularly binding long-term contracts, makes it difcult for potential suppliers to invest in long-term productive capacity, which would increase supply, permit greater reliability of supply and reduce the price. The result is higher prices for developing countries, lower use and occasionally supply constraints. Aware of this concern, UNICEF has moved toward longer contracts where possible. But it appears that UNICEF is con - strained in its ability to sign multiyear purchase agreements because its funding streams are typically guaranteed annually. In a recent procurement, the Vaccine Fund was able to give UNICEF multiyear funding \"in trust\" to support a multiyear contract. This arrangement involved setting aside money for future payments. Donors and UNICEF need to work together to establish whether there is some way to enable UNICEF to enter long-term contracts, either by amending the rules governing UNICEF's nancial position or by nding other possible nancing mecha - nisms, such as underwriting agreements or promissory notes. This situation also highlights the urgent need for reliable demand forecasts. Initiatives like the Accelerated Development and Introduction Plans for pneumococcus and rotavirus vac - cines are attempting to recognize the pivotal importance of hav - ing an accurate forecast of demand. Improving accuracy in this area would be an important contribution to reducing risk for all parties. Regulatory and procurement implications of advance market commitments The existing system of regulation and procurement should be able to accommodate the existence of an advance market com - mitment with little or no adaptation. The draft contract requires the supplier to obtain and main - tain authorizations and approvals necessary to market and sell approved vaccines in the eligible countries, and to maintain appro - priate qualication. It will be the responsibility of the Independent Adjudication Committee to determine whether a supplier of a qualifying product meets these conditions and is eligible for the price guarantee. In practice, the Independent Adjudication Com - mittee would be expected to draw on the respected expertise of the WHO both to designate approved regulatory bodies for the CGD 0414.indd 68 4/14/05 1:32:16 PM69 How sponsors can do it 7purposes of the contract (or more likely to designate the WHO to approve regulatory bodies) and to require WHO prequalica - tion as a condition of eligibility to supply the vaccine under the contract. However, though the Independent Adjudication Com - mittee would in practice want to rely on the existing capacity and expertise of the WHO, it would retain the nal decision about whether a supplier met the conditions for the guarantee. The price guarantee contract would provide top-up payments; these could be used in support of procurements made through UNICEF, the PAHO Revolving Fund or other qualied buy - ers supplying the public sector in eligible countries. Although, as discussed above, there might be advantages in these bodies being able to make more use of long-term contracting, it is not strictly necessary for the implementation of an advance market commitment that these purchasers be able to do so. The reason for this is that the predictability of the advance market commitment is created by the Guarantee Agreement between the sponsors and the supplier, which guarantees sponsor co-payments, not by the terms of the actual procurement of vaccine. While it is possible that some technical adjustment of existing procurement arrangements might be necessary to enable the main public sector buyers to buy the vaccines that are eligible for the advance market commitment, in principle the introduction of guaranteed co-payment envisaged by the advance market com - mitment should not cause any substantive difculties for existing procurement processes.

It has existed for 80 years and is widely used. However, it does not prevent primary infection and, more importantly, does not prevent reac - tiviation of latent primary infection, the main source of bacillary spread in the community. The impact of BCG vaccination on transmission of Myobacterium tuberculosis is therefore limited. The World Health Organization (2004a) says, \"the development of efcient, safe and affordable vaccines against TB [tuberculosis] must remain a global priority.\" 7. DTwP coverage in OECD countries has fallen from 90% to 34% as they now use DtaP (diphtheria, tetanus and acellular per - tussis)\u2014a more costly product that is thought to have a marginally better safety record and a more reliable production prole. 8.

Predicting a future change in policy, economic actors adjust their behavior today. It is typi - cally solved by some form of institutional pre-commitment that prevents the authorities from \"re-optimizing\" in the later phase. An advance market commitment would provide such a commit - ment in this case. 16. Pecoul and others (1999), p. 364.

The vaccine was originally developed in 1983 by the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research. 8. See the Rotavirus Vaccine Program website www. rotavirusvaccine.org. 9. Rotashield, the world's rst rotavirus vaccine, was licensed for use in the United States in 1998. Prior to licensing, clinical trials in the United States, Finland and Venezuela had found it to be 80-100% effective at preventing severe rotavirus diarrhea, and researchers had detected no statistically signicant serious adverse effects. But Wyeth, the manufacturer of Rotashield, withdrew the vaccine from the market in 1999, after it was discovered that it might have contributed to an increased risk of intussusception, or bowel obstruction, in 1 of every 12,000 vaccinated infants (CNN 2004). 10.

Chapter 5 1. Acemoglu and Linn (2004).2. Grabowski, Vernon and DiMasi (2002) note that this is a comprehensive sample of the new chemical entities originating from and developed by the pharmaceutical industry that were introduced into the United States in 1990-94. Due to data limita - tions, we are unable to address whether the sales revenues of this CGD 0414.indd 72 4/14/05 1:32:17 PMMaking Markets for Vaccines73 sample of self-originated new chemical entities is a representative sample of the sales revenues of all commercial pharmaceutical products. Sales revenue data from a larger sample of products are available from (for example) IMS Health or Scott Levin Associ - ates. Further work could examine this and other potential sources of larger samples of sales revenue data. 3. Berndt and others (2005). Note that Grabowski, Vernon and DiMasi (2002) use this sales revenue data in combination with estimates of the cost of pharmaceutical development in order to estimate total returns; we did not use these cost of development estimates (nor any other cost of development estimates) in our analysis. The $3.1 billion gure reflects an assumed industry-wide cost of capital (that is, earnings foregone on other investment opportunities) of 8% (close to the annual average return on the stock market) and a downward adjustment of 10% for lower mar - keting expenditures. Rosenthal and others (2002) estimate that marketing expenditures relative to sales have remained relatively constant at 15%; however, promotion/sales ratios are lower globally, and this 15% gure is also partly the result of an accounting nuance where the values of free samples given to physicians are assessed at average retail price rather than manufacturing price. Hence a 10% reduction for marketing expenditures seems appropriate. 4. Berndt and others (2005). We project a total market of $750 million in net present value of revenues (2004) dollars in high- and middle-income countries. This estimate is based on annual purchases of malaria prophylaxis drugs, as presumably people would be willing to pay comparable amounts for a malaria vaccine as for malaria prophylaxis drugs. An estimate from the popular press (Reuters 2003) and correspondence with Pzer suggest the annual market for malaria prophylaxis drugs from sales to travelers and tourists from developed countries and the military could be as much as $200 million, but others cite much lower gures. If a vaccine captured $100 million in peak sales and the prole of sales over time followed that of the average product in the Grabowski, Vernon and DiMasi (2002) sample, the total net present value of those sales would be about $750.7 million (assuming an 8% cost of capital). Adding in $100 million of additional revenues from private sales in low- and middle-income countries yields a default of $850 million in net present value of revenues outside the commitment program. 5. It is a coincidence that the $15 cost per DALY is the same as the $15 price per course of treatment. 6. Berndt and others (2005). Chapter 6 1. Acemoglu and Linn (2004). Chapter 7 1.

Funding for Working Group meetings, analytic work and consultations was provided under a grant from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. Because the power and limitations of push mechanisms are reasonably well understood, the Working Group has focused exclusively on whether and how to put into operation advance guarantees as an additional new tool for global health products. The results of this work are intended primarily to inform the donor community, which may wish to move toward implemen - tation of such an arrangement as one of several instruments to improve access to affordable vaccines for the developing world. The Working Group was convened solely for the purpose of exploring the practicality and value of advance contracting; it does not have and will not seek the legal status, the budget or the mandate to implement such an agreement. Members of the Work - ing Group were selected for their knowledge and expertise, and participate on a voluntary basis in their individual capacities. We focused exclusively on vaccines in this Working Group for a number of reasons. First, vaccines are among the most cost- effective of health interventions, and immunization programs have been shown to be enormously successful. Second, a key constraint to even greater effectiveness of immunization programs is availability of and access to new products related to the specic needs of children in the developing world. And nally, vaccines are purchased mainly by the public sector and development of new vaccines is a global public good so it is appropriate for donors to be thinking about the most effective ways to channel their immunization funds. We did not choose vaccines because it is the only area where advance contracting would work\u2014many of the principles outlined in this report may be transferable to drugs or diagnostics with some modications. Although the Working Group is not expected to continue after the publication of this report, resources related to the group's work will be available at the Center for Global Development's website (www.cgdev.org/vaccine).

Ernst Berndt and others have developed a spreadsheet model (available for download from the Center for Global Development website at www.cgdev.org/ vaccine) that allows users to manipulate all relevant variables in a flexible and user-friendly way, thereby permitting the analysis of a large number of different scenarios. The spreadsheet allows for the analysis of costs and benets of commitments for malaria, HIV and tuberculosis vaccines under various assumptions of vaccine characteristics as well as various contract parameters on the price and quantity of vaccines that would be purchased at the initial, high price. The spreadsheet combines these user-entered assumptions with a collection of demographic and disease burden data to estimate the cost per DALY saved as well as to calculate the net present value of the revenues that would accrue to a vaccine developer. For example, the user may vary general parameters (such as the discount rate and the cost effectiveness threshold for a DALY), and parameters that dene vaccine efcacy and the number of required doses. The user may change the set of countries covered by the program manually, by disease burden and/or using a GNP per capita cutoff. The user can also vary the conditions of adop - tion, including steady-state adoption rates and the length of time to reach the steady state. A technical guide posted online with the spreadsheet explains the calculations in detail in the order that the worksheets appear in the Microsoft Excel le. Since param - eters can be modied and results displayed in the graphical user interface, the user will rarely, if ever, need to refer to these detailed sheets. Berndt and others (2005) discuss both the general results of the spreadsheet analysis and sensitivity checks. CGD 0414.indd 89 4/14/05 1:32:23 PM90 1.Parties: One or more nongovernmental, grant-making organizations (such as a foundation) or governmental grant-making organizations (such as the U.S. Agency for International Development or the U.K. Department for International Development) (each, a \"Funder\" )1 and one or more pharmaceutical or biotech companies2 that will work within the Framework (as dened below) to develop eligible vaccine(s) (each, a \"Developer \"). 2.Purpose: Create a legally binding series of agreements3 that guarantees the developer(s) of a [____] vaccine4 that meets the requirements set forth in the agreements a specic price for each qualied sale of the vaccine in certain designated developing countries (the \"Framework\" ). The Framework Agreement will clearly state the goals and objectives of the Framework with regard to the target disease, the eligible countries and the affected populations. 5 3.Benets to Funder: Fullls the Funder's philanthropic mission (or a statutory or regulatory mandate, in the event Funder is a governmental organization) by giving Developers an economic incentive to (a) select and implement R&D projects that are likely to lead to vaccines developed specically for diseases concentrated in developing countries, and (b) establish manufacturing capacity for production of such vaccines. 4.Benets to Developers: Establishes a specic price for all eligible sales of the vaccine in developing countries that allows the Designated Supplier (as dened below) to cover, over the term of the agreements, R&D costs as well as manufacturing costs and to make an acceptable return on its investment. The guaranteed price will be based on a per-patient dosing regimen to provide the required prophylactic benet and will be paid on all eligible sales up to the maximum number specied in the Guarantee and Supply Agreement (the \"Maximum Guaranteed Amount\" ). For example, if a course of 3 immunizations are required to provide the necessary immunity, the guaranteed price is $15 and the Maximum Guaranteed Amount is 200 million, then the Developer would receive the guaranteed price of $15 only upon an eligible sale of all three doses comprising the course of treatment. If the Developer's total eligible sales equal the Maximum Guaranteed Amount, 600 million doses, or 200 million courses of treatment, then the Developer would receive a total payment of $3 billion. 6Appendix F Model term sheet for Framework Agreement CGD 0414.indd 90 4/14/05 1:32:24 PM91Appendix F Model term sheet for Framework Agreement Notes 1. The Framework Agreement and Guarantee Agreement term sheets were designed to accommodate a variety of Funders, despite the fact that there are substantial differences between governmental and nongovernmental organizations in areas such as funding capacity and ability to contractually commit to the Guarantee Agreement. We concluded that traditional commercial mechanisms for ensuring compliance, such as letters of credit or escrow arrangements, would be unattract - ive to potential Funders as they would result in increased transaction costs and unnecessarily tie up funds that could be made available for more immediate opportunities. Instead, we designed a bilateral contract structure, which would permit the Developer to pursue standard contract remedies, such as money damages and specic performance, if the Funders fail to satisfy their nancial commitments. 2. The Framework and Guarantee term sheets were designed to allow participation by both pharmaceutical companies and biotechnology companies. We considered, but did not incorporate, an alternative funding system recommended by a few of the biotechnology companies interviewed that would provide for interim payments, upon the achievement of certain predetermined milestones, to create incentives for research and early-stage development activities and encourage venture capital investment in emerging companies commit - ted to the Framework. We intend that intermediate incentives of this kind will be created by the commercial activities of Developers in the expectation of being remunerated through sales of vaccines under the Guarantee Agreement. 3. Initially, the Working Group considered establishing the Framework Agreement as a form of unilateral agreement. A unilateral agreement is an offer by one party, in this case the Funder, which only becomes a contract when it is accepted by the other party, the offeree or in this case the Developer. A unilateral agreement permits the offeror is withdraw its offer prior to acceptance, and what constitutes acceptance is not always clear, particularly in this context. We thought this risk might create too much uncertainty for the Developer and thereby dilute the effect of the commitment. The Framework Agreement as reflected in this term sheet would be bilateral agreement, which would be binding on the Funders as soon as one or more Developers sign on. 4. The Working Group initially intended that the Framework Agreement and Guarantee Agreement term sheets would be used for both late-stage and early-stage vaccine candidates. However, on further consideration, we decided that a form approach did not make sense for late-stage vaccine candi - dates, given the fact that specic Developers and Approved Vaccines had been identied for Rotavirus, and the recog - nition that each Developer had specic needs and objec - tives. Instead, the Working Group recommended that the Developers and the Funders directly negotiate long-term supply or other appropriate arrangements to ensure reliable, affordable supply to meet the long-term needs of Eligible Countries, while providing appropriate rewards for the vac - cine developer. 5. Each Framework Agreement will establish a specic price for qualied sales of an Approved Vaccine, by supplementing the \"base price\" paid by a vaccine purchaser (such as UNICEF on behalf of the developing country) up to a certain xed amount. 6. We concluded that the price guarantee should be for \"per course of treatment\" rather than \"per dose.\" This approach provides incentives to ensure that all doses of multiple dose vaccines are administered, and encourages the development of vaccines requiring fewer doses where scientically possible. CGD 0414.indd 91 4/14/05 1:32:24 PM92Appendix F Model sheet for Framework Agreement5.Principal Responsibilities of the Funder:The Funder shall (a) upon satisfaction of the conditions precedent set forth in Section 7, enter into a Guarantee and Supply Agreement (in the form attached to the Framework Agreement) with one or more Designated Supplier(s) (as dened below), 7 (b) fund the operation of the Independent Adjudication Committee (as dened below) in accordance with budgeted amounts, (c) indemnify the members of the Committee for claims and losses arising out of the performance of their duties under the Framework Agreement and the Guarantee and Supply Agreement, 8 (d) retain the Contract Administrators (as dened below) to administer the Framework in accordance with budgeted amounts, (e) maintain in strict condence any condential business information submitted to it by the Developers, and (f) agree to be bound by decisions of the Committee acting within the scope of its authority. 6.Principal Responsibilities of Developers:Each Developer shall (a) provide condential reports to the Independent Adjudication Committee on the progress of its development efforts at the times specied by the Committee (it is contemplated that these reports would be high-level annual status reports at the outset and would increase in frequency and detail as the development efforts advance), 9 (b) provide such technical information as may be reasonably requested by the Committee in order to conrm that the conditions precedent set forth in Section 7 have been satised, and (c) agree to be bound by decisions of the Committee acting within the scope of its authority. 7.Conditions Precedent to Obligations of Funder:It shall be a condition precedent to Funder's obligation to enter into and perform its obligations under the Guarantee and Supply Agreement that the vaccine meet (a) the technical specications outlined in Section 8 below, and (b) the usability requirements outlined in Section 9 below. 10 8.Technical Specications: For a vaccine to meet the technical specications it must, subject to Section 10, satisfy the approval, safety and efcacy requirements set forth in Schedule A. 9.Usability Requirements: For a vaccine to meet the usability requirements it must, subject to Section 10, satisfy the dosage, means of delivery, storage, shelf life and other requirements set forth in Schedule A. 10.Waiver of Conditions Precedent:After the effective date of the Framework Agreement the Independent Adjudication Committee may (by a 2/3 vote of its members or at the direction of the Funder) waive or modify the technical specications or usability requirements in a way that does not materially increase the cost of performance for a Developer. For purposes of illustrating the foregoing, if a specication called for 60% effectiveness, the Committee could, by a 2/3 vote of its members, reduce the requirement to 50% effectiveness, but could not increase it to 70% effectiveness under this provision. 11 CGD 0414.indd 92 4/14/05 1:32:25 PM93Appendix F Model term sheet for Framework Agreement 7. Until a vaccine is approved under the conditions set forth in Section 7 of the Framework Agreement term sheet, the Funder is only required to commit to the Framework Agree - ment, and fund the functions of the Independent Adjudica - tion Committee. Once an Approved Vaccine is identied, the Developer has the right, and the Funder the obligation, to enter into the Guarantee Agreement with respect to that product. 8. Indemnication was deemed to be particularly important to attract qualied members to serve on the Independent Adju - dication Committee. It is contemplated that this indemnica - tion would be similar to that which is provided to ofcers and directors of corporations. Accordingly, the indemnication of the members of the Independent Adjudication Commit - tee may exclude intentional misconduct or actions that are conducted in bad faith or for personal gain. 9. Developers may provide condential information to the Independent Adjudication Committee in two circumstances. First, Developers would submit progress reports to the Inde - pendent Adjudication Committee during the term of the Framework Agreement. These reports will provide a way to evaluate the effectiveness of the mechanism during the research and early development periods. These reports, if not promising, may permit the Funder to withdraw from the Framework Agreement under Section 25 of the term sheet. Second, for those Developers seeking to participate at a later date, the Framework Agreement requires some evidence that the Developer has a technology or expertise with scientic promise for the development of an Approved Vaccine. 10. Although the Framework Agreement is designed to create an enforceable bilateral contract between the Developers and the Funders, the Funders would not be obligated to enter into the Guarantee Agreement until a product is tendered that meets certain minimum technical specications, such as approval of both the product and its manufacturing process by a qualied regulatory body and certain safety, efcacy and use requirements. 11. Because there was concern that the Developer should be assured that the Funder could not change the rules of the game after the Framework Agreement was entered into, tech - nical requirements cannot be changed to increase the burden of those requirements, unless there is a signicant change in circumstances with respect to the disease that would sig - nicantly reduce the need for a vaccine or undermine the specications, such as a dramatic decrease in disease preva - lence, a signicant change in disease transmission or progres - sion or a major advancement in treatment. As noted below, these types of changes would be subject to judicial review. Technical requirements may be decreased, however, at the discretion of the Independent Adjudication Committee. CGD 0414.indd 93 4/14/05 1:32:25 PM94Appendix F Model term sheet for Framework Agreement11.Testing and Acceptance: The Developer shall submit the vaccine to the Independent Adjudication Committee for testing and acceptance. The Committee shall be responsible for making determinations with respect to whether a vaccine tendered by a Developer satises the conditions precedent set forth in Section 7, provided that the Independent Adjudication Committee shall have the right to delegate this responsibility to one or more third parties that it determines are qualied to make such determinations and are independent and unbiased, such as, for example, the World Health Organization's prequalication process. 12 Further, the Committee shall have the right to retain one or more consultants or rely on the actions of governmental or other third parties, such as the United States Food and Drug Administration, in making its determinations. In addition, the Committee shall have authority to grant waivers of, or make modications to, the application of specic technical specications or usability requirements as provided in Sections 10 and 22. 12.Designated Supplier: If the Independent Adjudication Committee determines that the conditions precedent have been satised (or if the conditions that have not been satised are waived or modied), then (a) the vaccine submitted by the Developer to the Committee shall be deemed an \"Approved Vaccine,\" (b) the Developer of the Approved Vaccine shall be deemed a \"Designated Supplier,\" and (c) if requested by the Designated Supplier, the Funder shall enter into the Guarantee and Supply Agreement with the Designated Supplier within thirty (30) days of the date of the nal, written determination of the Committee. 13 13.Composition of Independent Adjudication Committee:The Funder shall establish \"Independent Adjudication Committee\" or the \"Committee\" ), which shall comprise not less than [5] members. Members of the Committee will have expertise in the following elds: (a) immunization practices, (b) public health, (c) vaccinology and vaccine development, manufacturing and commercialization, (d) pediatric and internal medicine, (e) social and community attitudes on immunization, (f) economics, (g) contract law and (h) the vaccine industry, in each case, as applicable, with developing country perspectives. Members of the Committee shall serve a term of [_] years. Vacancies on the Committee will be lled by the remaining members of the Committee. 14.Actions of the Committee: Each member of the Independent Adjudication Committee shall have one vote. Fifty percent of the members of the Committee, rounded up, shall constitute a quorum. Except as provided in Sections 10, 20 and 22, all decisions of the Committee shall be made by majority vote of the members at a meeting at which a quorum exists. CGD 0414.indd 94 4/14/05 1:32:25 PM95Appendix F Model term sheet for Framework Agreement 12. The Working Group recognized that it would be extremely costly to create an Independent Adjudication Committee that was fully capable of independently evaluating, approving and monitoring the Approved Vaccines and their ongoing production. Accordingly, the Framework Agreement per - mits the Independent Adjudication Committee to rely on third parties and their procedures, such as the WHO and its prequalication process. 13. As noted above, the Framework Agreement is designed to be self-executing with respect to the Funders, providing the Developers with the right to enter into the Guarantee Agree - ment on the terms specied in the Framework Agreement. The Framework Agreement is also designed to permit more than one Developer to receive funds under the Guaran - tee Agreement. For the reasons discussed in the Guarantee Agreement, and more fully in the report, the Working Group determined not to pursue a winner-takes-all approach. CGD 0414.indd 95 4/14/05 1:32:25 PM96Appendix F Model term sheet for Framework Agreement15.Duties of the Committee: The Committee will (a) seek to identify independent, unbiased and expert-qualied institutions and procedures to assist with determining whether a product meets the technical specications and usability requirements and that can provide ongoing review of product safety and efcacy and manufacturing, (b) if necessary, designate Approved Regulatory Countries and Approved Manufacturing Countries from time to time, (c) evaluate products presented by Developers to determine if they satisfy the conditions precedent, (d) at its discretion or at the direction of Funder, waive or modify the application of specic technical specications or usability requirements pursuant to Section 10, (e) if requested or as necessary, conduct multiple bilateral or multilateral meetings with Developer(s) in order to provide information about testing and acceptance procedures, waivers and modications to the conditions precedent, market demand and supply forecasting, disease epidemiology and other relevant information, 14 (f) using the standards specied in Schedule B, determine whether subsequent vaccines are superior to the original Approved Vaccine, whether for certain target populations, epidemiological conditions or otherwise, and designate new Approved Vaccine(s) and new Designated Supplier(s), (g) after an Approved Vaccine has been designated, monitor the sales and use of such Approved Vaccine for ongoing compliance with the technical specications and usability requirements set forth in Sections 8 and 9 and decertify any vaccine that is not in material compliance with such specications and requirements, and (h) determine whether the technical specications and usability requirements set forth in Sections 8 and 9 or the Maximum Guaranteed Amount or Funder's other payment obligations under the Guarantee and Supply Agreement should be modied in whole or in part based on force majeure criteria pursuant to Section 22. 16.Duties of Committee Members:Each member of the Independent Adjudication Committee shall, in the exercise of its authority under the Framework Agreement, have the same duciary duties (including duty of care and duty of loyalty) as the director of a Delaware corporation. 15 17.Contract Administrator: The Funder shall retain one or more individuals (each, a \"Contract Administrator\" ) to implement the decisions of the Independent Adjudication Committee and to perform such other administrative, support and other tasks as may be assigned by the Committee, subject to the approved budget for administrative expenses. 18.Budget: The parties shall agree on a budgeting process to ensure that the reasonable expenses of the Independent Adjudication Committee and the Contract Administrators will be reimbursed by Funder. 16 CGD 0414.indd 96 4/14/05 1:32:26 PM97Appendix F Model term sheet for Framework Agreement 14. It is contemplated that the Developers would have the right to consult with the Independent Adjudication Committee, much the same way that companies consult with the FDA in the United States, to discuss the design of clinical trials, the structure of drug approval applications, the country or countries in which such approval will be sought, the pos - sibility of granting waivers and other issues relating to the approval of an Approved Vaccine. 15. The duties of a corporate director under Delaware Law are the duty of loyalty, the duty of care and the duty of good faith. The duty of loyalty requires the director to place the corporation's interests above his or her own. The duty of care requires the director to act with certain minimum level of skill and deliberation. The duty of good faith requires that a director not act with bad faith, or engage in intentional misconduct. 16. A Funder's obligation to reimburse the Independent Adju - dication Committee is subject to the requirement that its expenses be reasonable. A Funder may want to give further consideration to mechanisms that would permit it to regulate the cost of the Independent Adjudication Committee without compromising the Independent Adjudication Committee's independence. CGD 0414.indd 97 4/14/05 1:32:26 PM98Appendix F Model term sheet for Framework Agreement19.Addition of New Developers to the Framework:During the period beginning on the effective date of the Framework Agreement and ending [36] months thereafter, one or more entities may become parties to the Framework Agreement (i.e., Developers) upon written acceptance of the terms of the Framework Agreement by such entity. Thereafter, additional entities may become parties to the Framework Agreement upon (a) written approval by the Committee if the new entity has technology or expertise that shows promise for the development of an Approved Vaccine, and (b) written acceptance of the terms of the Framework Agreement by the new entity; provided that no entity may become a party to the Framework Agreement with respect to a product after it commenced clinical trials for such product without the consent of the Funder. 17 20.Addition of New Designated Suppliers:The Independent Adjudication Committee may (by a 2/3 vote of its members and using the standards specied in Schedule B) determine that a newly developed vaccine satises the conditions precedent in Section 7, subject to its waiver and modication authority, and is superior to the previously selected Approved Vaccine, whether for certain target populations or epidemiological conditions or otherwise. Upon such a determination by the Committee, the Developer of the newly developed vaccine shall have the right to become a party to the Guarantee and Supply Agreement, whereupon the Developer of the new vaccine shall be deemed a \"Designated Supplier\" and the new vaccine shall be deemed an \"Approved Vaccine.\" The addition of new Designated Suppliers and Approved Vaccines shall, in each case, be subject to the original Maximum Guaranteed Amount set forth in the Guarantee and Supply Agreement. 18 21.Reserved Rights of Developer:Developer reserves all rights, and the Framework shall not apply, to sales of any Approved Vaccine (a) outside the eligible countries identied in the Guarantee and Supply Agreement, and (b) in the military or travelers markets. 22.Force Majeure In the event that there is a substantial change in circumstances with respect to [disease] in the countries identied in the Guarantee and Supply Agreement, including, without limitation, its incidence, its characteristics or methods for its treatment or prevention, such that the technical specications outlined in Section 8, or the usability requirements outlined in Section 9 no longer achieve the original objectives, the Committee shall have the right (by a 3/4 vote of its members), using the criteria set forth in Schedule C, to (a) modify the technical specications or the usability requirements, as applicable, (b) reduce the Maximum Guaranteed Amount or the Funder's other nancial obligations to reflect changes in the number of eligible countries or the incidence of untreated [disease] in those countries, or (c) terminate the Framework Agreement. Unlike other decisions of the Committee, these decisions shall be subject to judicial review by an appropriate forum to determine whether the Committee abused its discretion. 19 23.Representation and Warranties:[TBD] CGD 0414.indd 98 4/14/05 1:32:26 PM99Appendix F Model term sheet for Framework Agreement 17. These procedures were intended to strike a balance between, on the one hand, permitting companies with promising tech - nology or relevant expertise to participate in the Framework and, on the other hand, discouraging free riders who would operate outside the Framework and sign on only at the last minute. If companies do not sign on to the Framework, the agreement would lose its binding effect. Moreover, it would be difcult for the Funders to monitor the success of the Framework, particularly with respect to research and early development, without the periodic reporting by the Devel - oper required under the Framework Agreement. Funders may wish to strike a different balance, such as allowing compa - nies to join the Framework up until they commence pivotal trials. 18. The Working Group devoted considerable discussion to the question of whether more than one Developer would be permitted to receive payments under the Guarantee Agree - ment. On the one hand, the Working Group felt that it was important to preserve incentives for product improvements and that it would be important to use superior products should they be developed. On the other hand, the Work - ing Group was concerned companies might be less willing to risk large investments in early research if they faced the prospect of entry of \"me too\" products offering no signicant advance over the original vaccine. However, many of the industry participants interviewed by the Working Group indicated that they would prefer to have multiple suppliers over a winner-takes-all approach. Recognizing that indepen - dent research may lead to the development of substantially similar products, another option would be to permit any qualifying vaccines, whether or not superior, that are ten - dered within a window ( e.g., one year) after the approval of the initial Approved Vaccine to be accepted without showing superiority, provided that the second vaccine resulted from independent research and is not simply a generic copy. 19. The Framework Agreement for an early stage vaccine could be in force for a decade or more before a vaccine candidate is presented for nal review to the Independent Adjudica - tion Committee. Accordingly, a force majeure provision permitting the Funder to alter the Framework Agreement based upon extraordinary events has been included. The force majeure clause would void or alter the Framework Agreement in the event of major changes to technology, disease epidemiology or the like that make a vaccine either inappropriate or unnecessary or that would require a change in the specications that would be more burdensome to the Developers. These determinations are subject to judicial review. CGD 0414.indd 99 4/14/05 1:32:27 PM100 Appendix Framework Agreement24.Indemnication and Insurance:[TBD] 25.Term and Termination: The term will begin on the date that [__] Developers have executed the Framework Agreement (the \"Effective Date\") and, unless earlier terminated pursuant to Section 22 or this Section 25, continue until the [_____] anniversary of that date, unless a Guarantee and Supply Agreement has been entered into prior to such anniversary in which case the term shall continue until the later of such anniversary and the expiration or earlier termination of the Guarantee and Supply Agreement. Funder shall have the right to terminate the Framework Agreement (a) after the [______] anniversary of the Effective Date if no Developer has commenced GLP toxicology studies for a product that shows reasonable promise to become an Approved Vaccine, (b) after the [______] anniversary of the Effective Date if no Developer has commenced clinical trials for a product that shows reasonable promise to become an Approved Vaccine, (c) after the [______] anniversary of the Effective Date if no Developer has commenced a pivotal clini - cal trial designed to demonstrate that a product meets the technical specications and the usability requirements for an Approved Vaccine, (d) after the [______] anniversary of the Effective Date if no Developer has led an NDA or other comparable ling for a product that meets the technical specications and the usability requirements for an Approved Vaccine, and (e) after the [______] anniversary of the Effective Date if no Developer has entered into a Guarantee and Supply Agreement with respect to an Approved Vaccine.20 26.Remedies in the Event of Breach:[TBD] 27.Dispute law]. 29.Waiver of Immunity: If the Funder is a sovereign, it will (a) acknowledge that the transactions are subject to private commercial law, and (b) if it has not already done so, waive sovereign immunity. 30.Other Provisions: Other covenants, terms and provisions as requested by legal counsel to Funder or the Developers. 31.Exhibits: Guarantee and Supply Agreement.

The Funders have the right to terminate the Framework Agreement if certain interim milestones have not been achieved in a timely manner. This provision is included to provide the Funders with an option to end the agreement if the Framework does not appear to be stimulating produc - tive research and development activities. This would permit Funders to pursue other, more promising opportunities.

The \"Base Price\" is the amount actually paid, directly or indirectly, by the purchaser of the Approved Vaccine. 6 4.Principal Responsibilities of Designated Supplier:The Designated Supplier will (a) use commercially reasonable efforts to create awareness of the availability of the Approved Vaccine in the Eligible Countries in order to meet the public health requirements in the Eligible Countries, 7 (b) [use commercially reasonable efforts to] establish manufacturing capacity for the production of the Approved Vaccine that is sufcient to meet the public health requirements for the Approved Vaccine in the Eligible Countries, 8 (c) obtain and maintain World Health Organization (WHO) prequalication (or any substitute qualication determined by the Committee) for the Approved Vaccine, 9 and those facilities used in its production, as well as any local authorizations and approvals necessary to market and sell the Approved Vaccine in the Eligible Countries, including by complying with all adverse event reporting requirements and providing ongoing evidence of product and production safety and regulatory compliance, (d) provide the Committee with copies of all written communications to or from, including all lings or submissions to, and summaries of all oral communications with, the WHO or any other relevant regulatory agency with respect to the Approved Vaccine, (e) in connection with the marketing, distribution and sale of the Approved Vaccine, comply with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and all other applicable law, 10 (f) provide information as reasonably requested by the Committee from time to time in order to conrm ongoing compliance with the technical specications and usability requirements set forth in Sections 8 and 9 of the Framework Agreement, (g) agree to be bound by decisions of the Committee acting within the scope of its authority, 11 and (h) continue to supply product to Eligible Countries to meet their requirements as provided in Section 8.Model term sheet for Guarantee and Supply Agreement CGD 0414.indd 104 4/14/05 1:32:28 PM105Appendix G Model term sheet for Guarantee and Supply Agreement Notes 1. The Framework and Guarantee Agreement term sheets were designed to accommodate a variety of sponsors, despite the fact that there are substantial differences between governmental and nongovernmental organizations in areas such as funding capacity and ability to contractually commit to the Guarantee Agreement. There were discussions regarding mechanisms for ensuring that sponsors are and remain bound by their nancial commitments under the Framework and Guarantee Agreements. In the end, the Working Group concluded that traditional com - mercial mechanisms for ensuring compliance, such as letters of credit or escrow arrangements, would be unattractive to potential Funders as they would result in increased transaction costs and unnecessarily tie up funds that could be made available for more immediate opportunities. Instead, the Working Group elected to implement a bilateral contract structure, which would permit the Developer to pursue standard contract remedies, such as money damages and specic performance, if the Funders fail to satisfy their nancial commitments. The Guarantee Agree - ment term sheet would permit a single Funder, multiple Funders or a system where a lead Funder parcels out participations to sub-Funders. Some of the potential Funders considered by the Working Group include private foundations, developed country governments and international organizations. 2. The Guarantee Agreement is designed so that price for each Qualied Sale could vary. For example, a higher payment could be made in the early years to permit the Developer to recapture R&D costs and capital investments in manufactur - ing capacity more rapidly, with lower payments in the later years. 3. The Working Group determined that a price Guarantee, rather than a minimum quantity Guarantee, would be the basis for the incentive. See chapter 4 for an explanation. The pricing structure can be designed to provide substantial insurance against demand risk for prospective vaccine developers so as to yield a net present value of revenue comparable with com - mercial products even under pessimistic uptake scenarios. 4. Sufcient vaccine must be made available to satisfy the require - ments of all Eligible Countries. A Developer could not select a few Eligible Countries where it wishes to offer the vaccine or cease to supply vaccine once the price supplements cease to apply. 5. The Approved Maximum and the Guaranteed Price can be set to yield desired revenue. Price guaranties are on a per treatment basis\u2014such as course of immunization\u2014rather than a per dose basis. 6. A Base Price concept, similar to a co-payment, was introduced to create an incentive to help ensure that qualifying vaccines are not wasted and that payments are not made for unusable vaccines. If countries, or other donors, are required to make a minimum investment in an Approved Vaccine, then there is greater likelihood that appropriate quantities of the vaccine will be procured and that those quantities will be administered. This also provides an additional safeguard that donor funds will not be wasted on a vaccine for which there is no market. Especially for diseases for which the vaccine research is still at an early stage, the technical specications in the Framework Agreement may be established many years in advance of iden - tifying promising vaccine technology, or, for that matter, the delivery of an Approved Vaccine. Intervening events, such as improvements in sanitation or pesticide use, may render a technically adequate vaccine unnecessary. Similarly, unforeseen characteristics of an Approved Vaccine, such as medically harm - less but culturally unacceptable side-effects, which would not have been addressed in the technical specications, may render an otherwise safe vaccine unsuitable in certain countries. The co-payment requirement helps ensure that the advance market CGD 0414.indd 105 4/14/05 1:32:28 PM106 Appendix G Model term sheet for Guarantee and Supply Agreement5.Qualied Sale: The sale of the Approved Vaccine for use in an Eligible Country shall be deemed a \"Qualied Sale\" if it meets the criteria set forth in Schedule B, as modied from time to time by the Independent Adjudication Committee. In the event of a conflict between Funder and the Designated Supplier over whether a particular sale of the Approved Vaccine satises the criteria for a Qualied Sale, the matter shall be referred to the Independent Adjudication Committee, whose decision shall be nal and binding on the parties. 6.Eligible Countries: Each of the countries listed in Schedule C shall be deemed \"Eligible Countries\" ). Schedule C may be revised from time to time by the Independent Adjudication Committee in order to (a) add countries whose per capita GDP (as determined by [_____]) is less than [$____], or (b) remove countries whose per capita GDP (as determined by [_____]) is greater than [$____]. 7.Cap on Total Commitment [and Termination of Commitment]:The total payment obligation of Funder pursuant to the Guarantee and Supply Agreement, including all payments and distributions to the initial Designated Supplier and any additional or replacement Designated Suppliers, shall (a) not exceed, in the aggregate, [$_________] (the \"Maximum Guaranteed Amount\" ), and (b) be subject to termination or modication by the Independent Advisory Committee pursuant to Section 22 of the Framework Agreement. [Schedule C of the Framework Agreement sets forth the assumptions underlying the calculation of the Maximum Guaranteed Amount and the criteria for adjusting it if the number of Eligible Countries is materially reduced or a force majeure event occurs.] 8.Supply The Designated Supplier shall supply all requirements of the Approved Vaccines in Eligible Countries during the Funding Term as provided herein and, thereafter, for a period of [10] years, or such longer period as the Designated Supplier may determine (the \"Supply Term\" ), at a price not to exceed (a) if the Designated Supplier has received payments for the sale of the Approved Vaccine in Eligible Countries (the \"Gross Sales\" ) in amounts, in the aggregate, greater than [$_______] (the \"Minimum Gross Sales Amount\" ), then the lesser of [__]% of its fully burdened (without recapture of research and development) costs and expenses to manufacture the Approved Vaccine and [$___] per Dose (as dened in Schedule B), and (b) if the Designated Supplier has not received such payments in such amounts, then the per-Dose amount in clause (a) shall be increased by [__]% only until the aggregate Gross Sales for the Approved Vaccine equals the Minimum Gross Sales Amount, whereupon the increase in this clause (b) shall cease to apply. 12 CGD 0414.indd 106 4/14/05 1:32:29 PM107Appendix G Model term sheet for Guarantee and Supply Agreement commitment will be used for Approved Vaccines that actually meet the requirements of the Eligible Countries. 7. Although the Designated Supplier has responsibility for gen - erating awareness of the availability of Approved Vaccines in Eligible Countries, the Working Group, as noted above, recog - nized that the Funders must also share in this responsibility. 8. It is critical that the Designated Supplier have adequate manu - facturing capacity to meet all of the requirements of the Eli - gible Countries, not just the Approved Maximum amount of product. The Guarantee Agreement requires that the Des - ignated Supplier use commercially reasonable efforts in this regard, but a higher standard, such as best efforts or an abso - lute obligation, may be preferable in certain circumstances. In addition, as noted below, consideration needs to be given to the contract remedy if the Designated Supplier fails to establish adequate manufacturing capacity, or otherwise to meet its supply requirements, under the Guarantee Agree - ment, particularly once the Guaranteed Price commitment has been exhausted. 9. The Working Group recognized that it would be extremely costly to create an Independent Adjudication Committee that was fully capable of evaluating, approving and monitoring the Eligible Vaccines and their ongoing production. Accordingly, the Guarantee Agreement permits the Independent Adjudica - tion Committee to rely on third parties and their procedures, such as the WHO and its prequalication process. 10. Compliance with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act was imposed to alleviate concern that illegal payments might be used to generate demand. Obviously, the purpose of the advance market commitment is to generate orders for vaccines that will be used, not to simply to generate orders for vaccines.11. The Working Group recognized the tension between the need for certainty in the determinations of the Independent Adjudication Committee and the need for some review. Court review was deemed impractical in most circum - stances. Instead, the goal is to create an IAC that would be viewed as independent by all participants in the Frame - work, but that is subject to review if it exceeds or abuses its authority, and with respect to certain critical decisions such as a decision to alter or terminate the Funder's payment obligation in the face of a force majeure event, as discussed in note 15 below. 12. The Guarantee Agreement requires that the Designated Supplier continue to make Approved Vaccines available even after the Funding Period expires on a cost-plus basis subject to a cap. If there are multiple Designated Suppli - ers, the cap will be increased for a limited time for any Designated Supplier that does not receive a certain mini - mum percentage of the Maximum Guaranteed Amount during the Funding Term, which amount is dened as the Minimum Gross Sales Amount. The increase will cease to be effective, and the cap will return to the predetermined amount, once the Designated Supplier's aggregate sales equal the Minimum Gross Sales Amount. The Minimum Gross Sales Amount is intended to be a rough proxy for a return on the Developer's investment in the Eligible Product, but cannot exceed 100% of the Maximum Guaranteed Amount. For simplicity, the term sheet includes a cost-plus formula, subject to a cap, for determining the ongoing supply price, but it is possible to include more complex hybrid options. For example, a formula could be employed that would allow the Designated Supplier to share in the benets of reducing the cost of production. In any event, setting the ongoing supply price is a critical component of the advance market commitment. CGD 0414.indd 107 4/14/05 1:32:29 PM108 Appendix G Model term sheet for Guarantee and Supply Agreement9.Intellectual Property: The Designated Supplier shall own all right, title and interest in and to the Approved Vaccine; provided, however, if the Designated Supplier fails to supply Approved Vaccine in the Eligible Countries as required in Section 8 during the Funding Term or the Supply Term and, in any event, within 2 years prior to the expiration of the Supply Term, the Designated Supplier shall grant Funder, or its designee, a non-exclusive, irrevocable, perpetual, license (with the right to sublicense) solely to make, have made, use, sell, offer for sale and import the Approved Vaccine in any Eligible Country, but Funder shall not have rights to any other products and shall have no rights outside the Eligible Countries, except the right to make and have made Approved Vaccine for use in Eligible Countries. The license grant shall be royalty-free, unless the Designated Supplier has not been paid the Minimum Gross Sales Amount, in which case such grant shall be subject to a royalty of [__]% of net sales until such time as the aggregate royalty payments to the Designated Supplier equal the product of (a) [__]%, multiplied by (b) the amount, if any, by which the Minimum Gross Sales Amount exceeds the aggregate Gross Sales of the Approved Vaccine, whereupon such vaccine will be fully paid and no further royalties shall be due. 13 10.Representation and Warranties:[TBD] 11.Indemnication: The Designated Supplier will defend and indemnify the Funder and the members of the Independent Adjudication Committee from all claims and losses arising out of or related to (a) the use of the Approved Vaccine, including claims and losses for physical or mental injury (including death) and (b) infringement or misappropriation of intellectual property. 14 12.Term: The Guarantee and Supply Agreement shall begin on the date that the Committee designated the rst Approved Vaccine and continue through such time as the Maximum Guaranteed Amount has been paid (the \"Funding Term\" ), and, thereafter, until the end of the Supply Term, unless earlier terminated pursuant to Section 13. 13.Termination: The Guarantee and Supply Agreement may be terminated by either party in the event of a material breach that is not cured within 30 days of notice thereof from the non-breaching party. In addition, Funder shall have the right to terminate the Guarantee and Supply Agreement (a) with respect to a particular Designated Supplier in the event the Independent Adjudication Committee determines that the Approved Vaccine of that Designated Supplier no longer satises the technical specications and usability requirements set forth in Sections 8 and 9 of the Framework Agreement, or (b) in the event of a force majeure event as determined by the Independent Advisory Committee as set forth in Section 22 of the Framework Agreement. 15 CGD 0414.indd 108 4/14/05 1:32:29 PM109Appendix G Model term sheet for Guarantee and Supply Agreement 13. If the Designated Supplier of an Approved Vaccine fails to meet its supply requirements under the Guarantee Agree - ment, it would be required to grant the Funder, or its des - ignee, a non-exclusive, royalty-free (except as necessary to provide the Designated Supplier with the Minimum Gross Sales Amount, as described above) license to exploit the Approved Vaccine only in Eligible Countries. Although less than ideal, this is intended to make the relevant technology available to the Funder if the Designated Supplier breaches its obligations under the Guarantee Agreement. However, because this provision may not provide much of an incentive not to breach, especially if a Designated Supplier has already received the Maximum Guaranteed Amount and because, even with this license, there could be a disruption of supply, potential Funders may wish to consider other penalties that would disincentivize a Designated Supplier from breaching, such as liquidated damages provisions. 14. Indemnication was deemed to be particularly important to attract qualied members to serve on the Independent Adju - dication Committee. It is contemplated that this indemnica - tion would be similar to that which is provided for directors and ofcers of corporations. 15. A force majeure provision permitting the Funder to alter the Guarantee Agreement based upon extraordinary events has been included. The force majeure clause would permit the Independent Adjudication Committee to void or alter the Guarantee Agreement in the event of major changes to technology or disease epidemiology that render a vaccine either inappropriate or unnecessary. For example, if advances in pesticides substantially reduced the incidence of malaria in Eligible Countries, then the Funder's nancial obliga - tion would be reduced accordingly. As noted in Section 7 of the Guarantee Agreement term sheet, Schedule C would include criteria, such as assumptions underlying the Frame - work Agreement, to guide the Independent Adjudication Committee in taking any such extraordinary action, which, as noted in the Framework Agreement term sheet, would be subject to review. CGD 0414.indd 109 4/14/05 1:32:30 PM110 Appendix G Model term sheet for Guarantee and Supply Agreement14.Addition of New Designated Suppliers:If the Independent Adjudication Committee determines (by a 2/3 vote of its members and using the standards specied in Schedule B of the Framework Agreement) that a newly developed vaccine is superior to the previously selected Approved Vaccine, whether for certain target populations or epidemiological conditions or otherwise, and the Developer of the newly developed vaccine elects to become a party to the Guarantee Agreement, the Developer of the new vaccine shall be deemed a \"Designated Supplier\", the new vaccine shall be deemed an \"Approved Vaccine\" and the new Designated Supplier shall have the right to compete with the original Designated Supplier to make Qualied Sales of the new Approved Vaccine in the Eligible Countries under the Guarantee Agreement. 16 The addition of new Designated Suppliers and Approved Vaccines shall, in each case, be subject to the cap on Sponsor's total commitment set forth in Section 7. 15.Remedies in the Event of Breach:[TBD] 16.Dispute Resolution: law]. 18.Waiver of Immunity: If the Funder is a sovereign, it will (a) acknowledge that the transactions are subject to private commercial law, and (b) waive sovereign immunity. 19.Other Provisions: Other covenants, terms and provisions as requested by legal counsel to Funder or the Designated Supplier. CGD 0414.indd 110 4/14/05 1:32:30 PM111Appendix G Model term sheet for Guarantee and Supply Agreement 16. The Working Group devoted considerable discussion to the question of whether more than one Developer would be permitted to receive payments under the Guarantee Agree - ment. On the one hand, the Working Group felt that it was important to preserve incentives for product improvements and that it would be important to use superior products should they be developed. On the other hand, the Working Group was concerned companies might be less willing to risk large investments in early research if they faced the prospect of entry of \"me too\" products offering no signicant advance over the original vaccine. However, many of the industry par - ticipants interviewed by the Working Group indicated that they would prefer to have multiple suppliers over a winner-takes-all approach. Recognizing that independent research may lead to the development of substantially similar products, another option would be to permit any qualifying vaccines, whether or not superior, that are tendered within a window (e.g., one year) after the approval of the initial Approved Vac - cine to be accepted without showing superiority, provided that the second vaccine resulted from independent research and is not simply a generic copy.

Qualied Buyer include (a) UNICEF, (b) WHO, (c) Pan American Health Organization, (d) any individual Eligible Country that is purchasing for the benet of the public sector or local nonprots, and (e) and any other buyer approved by the Independent Adjudication Committee. 2. Buyers Excluded. A pharmaceutical company, acting directly or indirectly thorough one or more intermediaries, shall not qualify as a Qualied Buyer. B. Sales Criteria. 1. Course of Treatment. A single course of treatment, regard - less of the number of individual immunizations, required to provide the desired efcacy and duration of protection shall be deemed a single \"Dose\" and shall constitute a single sale. For example, if 3 immunizations over a period of 2 years are required to achieve the desired efcacy and duration of protec - tion, then the sale of all 3 immunizations, one Dose, shall be required to constitute a Qualied Sale. 2. Bundled Sales. In the event that the Designated Supplier bundles the sale of the Approved Vaccine to a purchaser with the sale or licensing of another product or service of the Des - ignated Supplier or its afliates, the Designated Supplier shall reasonably assign prices to (allocate revenue amounts between) the Approved Vaccine and such other products or services sold or licensed by the Designated Supplier or its afliates to the purchaser, in accordance with the terms set forth in Exhibit B1 in order to ensure that the Designated Supplier has attributed a reasonable and equitable portion of that sale to the Approved Vaccine. 3. No Top Up. The Designated Supplier shall not seek or receive any additional compensation or value for the sale of the Approved Vaccine in an Eligible Country other than compen - sation from the purchaser in the form of the Base Price and the compensation from the Funder under the terms of the CGD 0414.indd 112 4/14/05 1:32:31 PM113Appendix G Model term sheet for Guarantee and Supply Agreement Guarantee and Supply Agreement; provided, however, that the Designated Supplier may seek and receive additional compen - sation or value if (a) additional Funders are added to the Guar - antee and Supply Agreement by amendment, or (b) approved by the Independent Adjudication Committee in writing. 4. Use in an Eligible Country. If the Approved Vaccine is pur - chased for use in a particular Eligible Country, the Designated Supplier must have a reasonable expectation that the Approved Vaccine will actually be used in such Eligible Country. For purposes of illustrating the foregoing, if UNICEF, as it pres - ently operates, certies that a country has certain requirements for the Approved Vaccine, then the Designated Supplier will have a reasonable expectation that such requirements of the Approved Vaccine will actually be used in such country.
