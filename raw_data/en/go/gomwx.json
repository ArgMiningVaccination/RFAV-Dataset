The key elements require:Leadership establishes antimicrobial as an organizational priority.The hospital has an antimicrobial stewardship team including at least an infectious diseasesphysician, infection preventionist, pharmacist, and a practitioner.The hospital educates staff and all licensed independent practitioners about antimicrobialresistance and antimicrobial stewardship practices, upon hiring or the granting of privilegesthen occurring periodically as needed.Systemic evaluation of the indication for antimicrobial usage, and of the ongoing treatmentneed after a set period of time, such as 48 hours. Providers will get real time feedback, advice,and education from Drs. Wainscoat, Nailor, and Goodlet by text and phone calls initially.The program uses evidence based protocols, policies and procedures for best practice.Examples include antibiotic restrictions, evidence based guidelines for common infections-community acquired pneumonia, urinary infections, Clostridium difficile, and cellulitis as2 of 26examples. Also, guidelines are implemented for antibiotic prophylaxis, use of antimicrobials inadults, and transition from IV to PO therapy. Thanks to the local antimicrobial stewardship committee and HHC Antimicrobial Council, much of thiswork was done for EPIC, and you will hear more about this in the coming weeks in Seymour Streetand at a Department of Medicine Grand Rounds March 23. Look for antimicrobial stewardshipvignettes in this journal over the coming weeks.CMEOffice Broadens Offerings For ProvidersOur Continuing Medical Education (CME) office serves all of Hartford HealthCare, including thehospitals.As part of Leadership and Organization Development, we are striving to broaden the depth andbreadth of our CME offerings, and aim to provide multi-channel, multi-disciplinary and multi-modaleducational opportunities for all providers across the system.This system-wide strategy will be supported by a talented team of individuals.

Many of you are involved in daily huddles that help your teams respond rapidly to improveprocesses and overall patient care.I thank you for your hard work in implementing and adjusting to this new way of working. Our progressin implementing LEAN has been admirable: Over the past year, we have stood up 48 new groups and laid the foundation for more rapidexpansion going forward. Ten of our groups have achieved Bronze status, which is a LEAN certification, and they are workingtoward Silver status for high performance. We plan to stand up dozens of additional daily management sites and achieve Bronze certification in24 more. More than 630 Hartford HealthCare leaders have completed Advanced Lean Training, with morethan 40 percent from Hartford Hospital. Many of you have participated in the disciplined five-day, rapid improvement Kaizan process. Hereare a few examples of what groups have achieved:Reduced handoffs for psychiatric patients transitioning from HH to the Institute of Living from32 to six, reducing processing time significantly.Improved the number of stroke patients discharged by 11 a.m., to 88 percent up from 73percent, and improved outpatient appointment compliance to 90 percent from 60 percent.Reduced the number of phone calls made to heart-failure patients transitioning to home from11 to three; initiated home care visits within 24 hours of transition, compared to a one- tothree-day wait before; and improved the quality and accuracy of transition paperwork by morethan 90 percent.LEAN now is the way Hartford Hospital works, and we expect our efficiencies and effectiveness tocontinue to improve. Thank you for your participation in this journey.4 of 26From Dr. Rocco Orlando, Senior Vice President and ChiefMedical OfficerDr. Rocco Orlando: Hospitals And Clinics Fear Cuts In Medicaid Under TrumpHartford Courant, December 20, 2016As the future of Obamacare hangs in the balance, the chief medical officer for Hartford HealthCaresays that scaling back the Medicaid part of the law would mean a loss of \"tens of millions of dollars\" inrevenue and would result in staff reductions and scaling back of services.Dr. Rocco Orlando, chief medical officer for the Hartford HealthCare system, said the hospital'sleaders are very concerned about the prospect of the federal government no longer paying the vastmajority of the cost of expanding eligibility for Medicaid.\"It would have profound impact; it's very much front of mind,\" he said.He's assuming Connecticut could not cover the cost of about 200,000 people who were able to getcovered under Medicaid after the law broadened eligibility for the public health insurance.This year, Connecticut will need to come up with about $61 million for a Medicaid expansion that waspart of Obamacare, which is also known as the Affordable Care Act.But the bill that could come due in 2019 or 2020 if Obamacare is repealed is far more significant.Currently, the federal government pays 98 percent of the $1.2 billion annual cost to insure 201,000poor adults in Connecticut who used to make too much to qualify for Medicaid. Under Obamacare, thefederal share was going to gradually shrink until it was a 90 percent match - far more generous thanthe 50 percent match Connecticut receives for another 555,000 residents covered by Medicaid.\"The [Affordable Care Act] expanded coverage to a significant number of individuals; this expansionwas funded in part through cuts to Medicare payments to hospitals,\" the Connecticut HospitalAssociation said in a statement. \"If the law is repealed and the cuts remain in place, Connecticuthospitals' fiscal stability and sustainability, as well as patient access to care, will be compromised.\"Vice President-elect Mike Pence recently promised to repeal Obamacare \"lock, stock, and barrel\"early next year, but congressional leaders are saying there will be a two- or three-year transitionperiod before the health bill's replacement takes effect.\"My sense is there'll be a little breathing room. I think there will be a public repeal in January, but Ibelieve they're going to be prudent enough to delay implementation for anything for two years or threeyears,\" Orlando said.Orlando said Hartford HealthCare's five acute care hospitals, two mental hospitals and myriadoutpatient programs would not be affected much by disruption in the individual private insurancemarket. But they are very concerned about the prospect of tens of thousands of people losingMedicaid coverage.Hospitals have seen a reduction in uncompensated care since Obamacare rolled out. At Meriden'sMidState Medical Center, Hartford HealthCare's location with the most significant number of uninsuredpatients, the proportion of uninsured patients fell from nearly 2.5 percent to barely more than 1percent.At the Hospital of Central Connecticut, the cost of uncompensated care fell from $10.7 million in Fiscal2013 to $6.1 million in Fiscal 2015.Dr. Tom Price, president-elect Donald Trump's selection to lead the Department of Health and HumanServices, which oversees Medicare, Medicaid and Obamacare, would like to move from a guaranteeof health care to the poor to a set amount of spending per person. Instead of sharing the cost ofnursing home or hospital bills with states, the government would send a block grant and let the states5 of 26sort it out.Orlando said his colleagues are concerned about this approach, \"particularly if the move to blockgrant has an agenda to reduce Medicaid.\"They're not remaining silent about their concerns, either. He said they're \"very actively engaged inproviding input\" to Congress about what they want an Obamacare replacement to preserve.\"Regardless of your party affiliation, there are elements of the ACA that warrant ongoing support,\" hesaid.He acknowledged that Medicaid does not have the same kind of bipartisan support as some morepopular parts of the law. Price wrote a letter last year that said that Medicare, Medicaid and SocialSecurity \"are binding seniors and low-income families to a costly, centralized health care strategy thatintrudes on the personal decisions of patients and their doctors; promising retirement income thegovernment cannot provide; trapping the disadvantaged in a web of welfare programs that drawbeneficiaries into long-term government dependency.\"Bills for about half of all patients in nursing homes are covered by Medicaid. Some were not poor untilthe cost of long-term care wiped out their savings. And, Price's letter said the open-endedcommitment approach of these programs is unsustainable, and will require \"enormously higher taxes\"in the future.If a block grant approach freezes or reduces federal Medicaid spending, the 17 clinics that serve350,000 low-income Connecticut residents would be hit especially hard.These clinics, such as Community Health Services on Albany Avenue, get more than half of theirrevenue from Medicaid. Only 8 percent of their bills are paid through private insurance - generally forpeople who cycle on and off of Obamacare and Medicaid as their hours fluctuate during the year.Until last year, the centers received about $4 million a year in state funding, but with the budget crisis,that's no longer available.Deb Polun, director of government affairs and media relations for the Community Health CenterAssociation of Connecticut, said even though the arrival of Obamacare didn't increase the number ofcustomers, she and her colleagues are worried that if insurance is pulled from thousands of clients,they'll stop coming in for care.Top NewsAdditional Measures In Place for Duration of Flu SeasonDr. Rocco Orlando III, Hartford HealthCare Senior Vice President, Chief Medical OfficerWe began treating our first flu cases at Hartford HealthCare facilities in mid-December 2016.Because of our Universal Influenza Prevention Program, HHC staff members are better prepared toface the flu while keeping our patients, coworkers and ourselves as safe as possible. Here are someadditional measures we will take throughout the influenza season:Staff members with flu-vaccine exemptions must wear a mask whenever within six feet of anarea where patients/clients may be encountered, regardless of the location of the patient, theextent of interaction with the patient or whether or not the patient is currently present. Suchareas include clinical units, hallways, lobbies and public dining areas. (The mask may beremoved when eating.)Because influenza is not the only respiratory infection making the rounds this time of year, staffmembers should remember to follow standard cough and respiratory hygiene, including:covering the mouth and nose with a tissue when coughing or sneezing; disposing of the tissuein the nearest waste receptacle; and washing or disinfecting hands after contact with6 of 26respiratory secretions or contaminated material.Employees with fever, vomiting or diarrhea should stay home. Those with cold symptoms,such as a cough, sneezing or a sore throat, should stay home and return to work when theyare feeling better.Hartford HealthCare institutions will follow their protocols related to the masking of patientsand family members who have symptoms of respiratory illness. Standard and dropletprecautions will be followed as usual.With our Universal Flu Prevention Program, we have taken an extraordinary step together tosafeguard our patients and fellow employees. Let's continue to do everything we can to live our valueson behalf of the people we serve.2016: The Year in ReviewWatch the HHC Year in Review video: https://intranet.hartfordhealthcare.org/news-events/hhc-top-news/hhc-a-year-in-reviewWe bet you'll see some familiar faces!Priority Paging System IntroducedAs part of our ongoing work to improve communications between providers, Hartford Hospital willintroduce a priority paging system this month. The priority paging language benefits senders andreceivers and is available on the Intelliweb home page. The goal is to clarify expectations aroundreturning pages or inquiries and we expect it to be used by all providers. Messages are categorized as: STAT, urgent, and routine requests. STAT requests are to be returnedimmediately, urgent requests within 30 minutes, and routine page messages within two hours.Stat: Immediate return phone call required. This should be utilized infrequently; significantclinical implications if not addressed immediately.Urgent: High priority item requiring a response within 30 minutes. For example, clinical testresults, pain medication adjustmentRoutine: Non-urgent, does not require immediate response. Typical return call within 2 hours.Always include your full mobile phone number (10 digits) in text pageAlways TEXT page, don't page via \"5-PAGE\"Right Page Example: \"Urgent: N11/Katie/860-696-9171/Critical K\" Nursing Units Realigned as Ortho Patients Move to Bone & Joint InstituteThe recent opening of the HHC Bone & Joint Institute will enable Hartford Hospital to increasecapacity in the main hospital as orthopedic cases move to the new facility.Nursing units are being realigned and the number of private inpatient rooms is being increased, withmore than 85 percent of them in surgery and neurosciences.We plan to expand surgical and neuroscience capacity, update critical care alignment, improvecohorting of heart and vascular patients, and improve greater flexibility for staff.The project will be completed in July.Bone & Joint Institute and Hartford Hospital Debut New and Improved HospitalGownsThe new Hartford HealthCare Bone & Joint Institute has introduced a great advance for patients'comfort and modesty: The Model G hospital gown. This new model of hospital attire features full7 of 26coverage of the patient's backside. The gowns are being called the first major-release hospital gownredesign in almost a century.Introduced at the Bone & Joint Institute, the gowns were funded by a $35,000 donation from theHartford Hospital Auxiliary. Next, the gowns will be offered to maternity patients at Hartford Hospital,followed by other hospitals.Developed at the Henry Ford Innovation Institute in Detroit, the gown features full wrap-aroundcoverage, plastic snaps instead of cloth ties and a thicker cotton-poplin blend. The closed-back designincludes a fold-over access panel, with snaps that can turn a size medium into an extra large. Thedouble-breasted front has three snaps, instead of cloth ties, to close the gown. Despite the robe-likefit, medical professionals say the gowns allow full access for IVs and other medical lines. The gowns,like a new drug, were tested in a series of clinical trials at Henry Ford Hospitals.HHC CEO Elliot Joseph Blogs About His Recent Hip Replacement SurgeryIn the latest edition of his blog, Our Moment, HHC CEO Elliot Joseph reflects on his recent hipreplacement surgery as the new Bone and Joint Institute at Hartford Hospital opens its doors.

Four prosthetic and physical therapy students from the University ofHartford will join the mission.Dreaming and Working Together was started in 2003 by Garcia, a native of Peru, who collected morethan $5,000 recycling soda cans and donated it to a children's hospital in Lima, Peru. In 2006, a teamof physicians led by Wakefield accompanied Garcia to Peru, and volunteered at a governmenthospital which serves the uninsured and underserved population of Lima.In 2007, the team was joined by a physiatrist and a physical therapist, and the following year theyestablished an amputee program there.The rehabilitation team has made annual trips to Peru since, and has expanded from 5 to 21volunteers in 2016. Rehab services have expanded to include post-op spine rehab, outpatientmusculoskeletal and prosthetic management, and pediatric rehabilitation. They have also beenproviding education and training to our Peruvian counterparts to improve the continuity of care, anddonated funds to an organization in Lima to establish a wellness clinic in Ventanilla county for youngwomen and children. A dentist has also joined the team.With only three months to go, we are $6,000 below our operating budget. This will translate to anunreasonable increase in expense per team member, and at this time it appears that some core teamprosthetists and rehab therapists may not be able to afford to join us on this trip. We are appealing toyour generosity and charitable giving to close the gap.Please consider logging on to our website (dreamingandworkingtogether.net) and clicking on thedonate button.8 of 26ExcellenceDr. Paul Thompson Serves as Co-director of First Statin Associated MuscleSymptoms ForumDr. Paul Thompson. chief of Cardiology at Hartford Hospital, is the co-director of the First StatinAssociated Muscle Symptoms Forum in Bethesda, MD held January 13-14.Dr. Thompson will also provide several lectures at the symposium on research done at HartfordHospital.

Who will you becompeting with and how will the new facility advance orthopedic care in Connecticut?A: It's not who we're competing with, it's who we're competing for. We're competing for patients whowant and need the full depth of orthopedic and joint-health specialties, from sports medicine to injuryprevention to activity-specific rehabilitation and, of course, many forms of surgery. This facility is thenewest, most innovative and most comprehensive stand-alone center in the entire U.S. It's got aworld-class medical team, a unique, multidisciplinary musculoskeletal approach and a world-classfacility. It takes its place among the country's best freestanding specialty hospitals.Q: What does the new facility mean for the cost of these types of healthcare services in ourarea?A: At Hartford HealthCare, we have been adopting Lean organizational principles and techniquesthroughout our organization. We have trained - and continue to train - our managers in the use ofLean as part of our performance quality and innovation platform, which we call 'How HartfordHealthCare Works.' It's really the culture of our entire organization and it means working every day tomake health care better and more efficient for everyone, our patients and families.The Bone & Joint Institute at Hartford Hospital is the first facility that we have designed with Leanprinciples in mind. It is probably one of the few healthcare facilities in the nation created in this way.While this doesn't immediately translate into affordability, as healthcare costs are affected by manyfactors, we believe that it will. We know that our focus on prevention, with the state-of-the-art motionlab and other services, will help avoid both serious injuries and also the higher costs of treating thoseinjuries.And we expect the new facility, over time, to pioneer new efficiencies in orthopedic care that willultimately result in greater affordability for patients.Q: What partnerships has the Institute formed with companies or other providers and what dothey entail?A: The partnerships involved in creating and sustaining this one-of-a-kind facility are too numerousand complex to describe briefly. But I can say what it all adds up to: economic development. This is aperfect example of how investment can grow the state's economy. Designing, constructing andoutfitting the building involved more than 80 companies, including many small and mid-sized firms thatsupply everything from furniture and telephones to medical technology.Our main partner in the Bone & Joint Institute is Orthopedic Associates of Hartford, with nearly ahalf-century of experience in the full range of orthopedic care. Beyond that, we are tapping into theexpertise of our own member organizations, such as the Hartford Hospital Rehabilitation Network andother specialists.We also will partner for research with our Center for Education, Simulation and Innovation (CESI),which we are expanding. CESI has a range of partnerships with biomedical and biotech firms fortesting, training and evaluation. These partners include such companies as Intuitive Surgical andStanley Black & Decker. Making wise investments and working with the right partners produceadvances in patient care. This approach also helps the state's healthcare industry grow as aneconomic engine and laboratory of innovation.Q: How will Hartford HealthCare measure success in 2017, the Institute's first full year inbusiness?A: We will measure success at our Bone & Joint Institute at Hartford Hospital the way we measuresuccess across Hartford HealthCare: one patient at a time. Of course we have targets for numbers of12 of 26patients served and we also want to ensure that everything we do in the new facility touches the workof providers and the lives of patients across our system and across Connecticut.But it comes down to each encounter with every patient - whom we see, truly, as customers. We wantto do everything we can to keep them mobile and healthy and happy with the care they receive.Save the Date for the 2017 Black & Red Benefiting NeuroscienceSave Saturday, January 28, 2017, for Hartford Hospital's annual gala, the Black & Red.

Patients respond negatively to physicians who interruptthem, ignore them or seem uncomfortable with patients' emotional expressions.Examples of essential behaviors that physicians can use to demonstrate that they are carefullylistening to patients include:Communicate at the patient's level by sitting on a chair or stool.Use body language that demonstrates careful listening, such as nodding and eye contact.Confirm that you understand what a patient is saying by using verbal cues as they speak, suchas \"I see\" or \"Okay,\" and by summarizing what the patient has said once he or she hasfinished.Avoid interrupting. Out of concern, care providers often jump in with a solution before a patienthas finished expressing him or herself. When a patient is interrupted regularly, or when thesolutions offered do not meet a patient's needs, anxiety may increase. Give each patient timeto finish talking before responding. Acknowledge what the patient said, empathize with his orher feelings, and respond accordingly.Be inquisitive about the patient and the person. Ask patients questions about their health, whatcaused the hospitalization and how they feel about being in the hospital. Moreover,demonstrate caring that goes beyond the diagnosis by engaging patients in conversationsabout their lives. Refer back to these responses in future conversations with patients. Createrapport with a patient by asking questions beyond diagnosis:Inquiring about appropriate aspects of the patients' personal lives (e.g., if the patientcaught last night's game, will be taking any vacations this season, etc.).Stating your observations about the way a patient may be feeling (e.g., \"That musthave made you very anxious.\").By establishing rapport, a patient will be more likely to open up with questions and concerns duringthe visit. Therefore, physicians will have a greater opportunity to listen to the concerns and questionsat the heart of the patient's medical issues.The above essential behaviors are based upon Press Ganey best practices and can help to improveeach patient's experience. Look for next month's tips on the essential behaviors of how to explainthings to patients in a way they understand. Kudos to Drs.

I amconcerned that if there is a monopoly and the cost goes up that obtaining approval will be even moredifficult.\"We have about 150 patients on these drugs so this is quite an investment in time. I am notenthusiastic about the effort that will be required to switch half of these patients from the Praluent toRepatha.\"The crisis, if it turns out to be one, was precipitated by Amgen's successful lawsuit arguing thatPraluent infringed on its patents. A jury had ruled in Amgen's favor in March 2016, but the presidingjudge didn't immediately order Praluent off the market. She only did so last week after reviewingarguments from both sides.While an injunction typically is immediate, the judge acknowledged the public interest in havingalirocumab -- which was first to market and has some differences in dosing -- remain available whilethe case is under appeal. She allowed 30 days before the injunction would take effect, noted DanielMonaco, JD, an intellectual property lawyer at Drinker Biddle in Philadelphia, giving Sanofi andRegeneron time to file their expected appeal.The lawsuit wasn't over whether patent infringement occurred -- Sanofi and Regeneron did notdispute that their drug did so -- but, rather, centered on validity of Amgen's patent claims for itsmonoclonal antibody.\"There is no obligation for these parties to sit down and work out a deal,\" Monaco told MedPageToday in an interview. \"Amgen is entitled now to be the sole source of a product that falls within theirpatent claims.\"And that might be Amgen's preference. \"Amgen has the ability to supply all potential Repatha patientsand will work to ensure a smooth transition for patients who wish to switch to Repatha,\" a statementfrom the company said.Amgen pointed to protection of intellectual property as essential to the pharmaceutical industry, \"as itreinforces the incentives for the large and risky investments we make in innovation to bring forwardnew medicines to treat serious diseases.\"\"However, I think it would be a mistake for alirocumab to be removed from the market. This couldcompromise competitive pricing as well as interactions with both doctors and services to patients,\"argued Howard Weintraub, MD, who said he has many patients on both drugs as clinical director ofthe NYU Center for the Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease.But, \"since neither the Amgen product nor the Sanofi-Regeneron product offered a price advantage,there will be probably little change in the market place,\" said Peter A. McCullough, MD, MPH, ofBaylor Heart and Vascular Institute in Dallas. \"This event would have been more meaningful if theruling meant a shift to a more expensive product, which it does not.\"The companies could still decide to reach a settlement that would leave alirocumab on the marketwhile giving Amgen royalties on its sales.\"The prevailing party has an awful lot of leverage to extract terms for licensing to allow the accuseddrug to stay on the market,\" Monaco noted.But that quick solution might be unlikely, as Sanofi and Regeneron have said they plan to continuefighting.\"It is our longstanding position that Amgen's asserted patent claims are invalid, and we will request astay (suspension) of the injunction pending appeal,\" the two companies said in a joint statement sentto MedPage Today. \"We will also appeal the injunction ruling as well as the jury's earlier verdictupholding the validity of Amgen's asserted patent claims.\"If an appeal is filed, the process of filing briefs, appendices of evidence, and scheduling would likelyextend beyond 2017, Monaco said.\"I think there will be an appeal,\" he told MedPage Today. \"I would be surprised if there wasn't.\"20 of 26That delay would take the process past the point when cardiovascular outcomes trial results are due.\"I believe that we should have access to both drugs until the results of the outcome studies areknown,\" Weintraub said. \"I fully anticipate that both trials will be positive. However, it would be veryunfortunate (and unexpected) if alirocumab had positive results in the ODYSSEY study while the datafrom evolocumab was negative.\"Meanwhile, Carl \"Chip\" Lavie MD, said he might hedge his bets for patients at the Ochsner Heart andVascular Institute in New Orleans.\"I would probably try to prescribe Repatha until I hear resolution, but some insurances only allowPraluent now so this is not always possible,\" he said in an email. \"It will be a problem for the manypatients on Praluent and the practices using this if this issue is not resolved, although hopefully mostpatients would be quickly converted to Repatha, either monthly or every 2 week dosing regimens.\"In the HHC SystemState regulators OK closure of orthopedic practice in WaterfordThe DayThe state Office of Health Care Access has determined that Hartford HealthCare's decision toclose an orthopedic practice in the Crossroads Professional Building did not require the agency'spermission.In a decision released Tuesday, OHCA said that based on information provided by HartfordHealthCare and Backus Physician Services, the physicians group managed by a subsidiary ofHartford HealthCare, the Dec. 31 closure of Backus Physician Services Orthopedic Surgery \"does notconstitute a termination of inpatient or outpatient services by a hospital over which the Office of HealthCare Access has regulatory authority.\" Backus Physician Services is an independent legal entity,separate from The William W. Backus Hospital, which is affiliated with Hartford HealthCare, OHCAsaid. If it was a hospital-based practice, a certificate of need from OHCA would have been required.Shawn Mawhiney, spokesman for Hartford HealthCare, said the decision validates the hospitalnetwork's actions.\"We are pleased that the state Office of Health Care Access ruled that a certificate of need was notrequired in this matter, and we look forward to continuing to provide high quality healthcare services insoutheastern Connecticut - at our Crossroads location and beyond,\" he said.Backus and Hartford HealthCare recently received approval from OHCA to purchase a 51 percentownership share in the Constitution Surgery Center East, a 21-physician ophthalmic and orthopedicsurgery center at 174 Cross Road. Shortly after the approval, plans for a new, 19,000-square-footbuilding at a nearby location were announced. The current building is 7,000 square feet.\\OHCA'sinquiry into Hartford HealthCare's closure of the smaller orthopedic practice, where four orthopedicphysicians provided care, was prompted by a complaint last month from a Griswold resident who wasa patient of one of the doctors, Dr. Frank Maletz.Another of the four orthopedists, Dr. Jeffrey Salkin, said that even though state regulators did not findthe Hartford HealthCare violated regulations, the hospital network's actions should not be condoned.\"Just because it was within their legal boundaries, doesn't mean what they did was right,\" he said.Asked about his current status, he said that because of the way he and the other doctors weretreated, he is \"in no rush to sign up with another big institution.\"I think the story serves as a warning to those physicians who are willing to become employees andforfeit their independence,\" he said. \"Our story shows this kind of thing can and does happen.\"21 of 26Health Care News In the RegionState Physicians Panel Urges Four More Conditions Be Qualified For MedicalMarijuanaHartford CourantPatients suffering from painful ailments that include fibromyalgia, muscular dystrophy, shingles andrheumatoid arthritis should be able to get medical marijuana in Connecticut, a state panel of doctorsurged Wednesday.The proposed expansion of Connecticut's medical marijuana program to cover more types of diseasesand conditions is part of a national surge toward making pot more available to help ease severemedical problems.South Carolina lawmakers are now looking at legalizing medical marijuana. In Arkansas, a statecommission has just proposed authorizing 32 dispensaries for medical marijuana. A New Yorklicensed marijuana grower announced Wednesday its plans to provide home deliveries in New YorkCity, Westchester County and on Long Island.Connecticut Consumer Protection Commissioner Jonathan Harris said Wednesday that the state'smedical marijuana program \"is growing, maturing every single day.\" Connecticut's program now hasmore than 593 doctors certified to prescribe medical pot to more than 15,100 registered patients,Harris said, and the state's six marijuana dispensaries will soon grow to a total of nine.Flu cases seen as 'widespread' in ConnecticutNew Britain HeraldState health officials continue to keep an eye on the rising number of reported influenza cases, afigure now seen as widespread in Connecticut and other regions of the U.S.According to the state Department of Health, flu activity is rapidly increasing in Connecticut, withemergency department visits attributed to flu-like symptoms up from 5 percent to 6.7 percent.Meanwhile, the percentage of outpatient visits with an flu-like illness has recently increased above 2percent, well above the 1 percent that is generally considered the baseline when there are increasedinfluenza-associated visits to outpatient facilities.According to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention, reported flu cases spiked as 2016 cameto a close. As of last week, all but one of 10 U.S. regions designated by the agency are witnessingelevated influenza reports. Since October, more than 3,000 confirmed cases of the flu have beentallied by the CDC.Closer to home, physicians and medical facilities are working to prevent the spread of the virus thebest way they know how - by encouraging patients to get a flu shot. Several pharmacies, physicians'offices and urgent care and walk-in clinics in the region, including those operated by the HartfordHealthCare Medical Group, have the flu vaccine on hand.\"The mainstay of flu prevention remains vaccination,\" said Dr. Jack Ross, chief of infectiousdisease at Hartford Hospital, a facility in the Hartford HealthCare system.Ross said children in particular are susceptible to the flu and should be considered priority vaccinecandidates.It may be a bit more unnerving for youngsters this year, the doctor pointed out, since for the first timein more than a decade the vaccine in nasal spray form is no long available.The CDC has prohibited the spray because in recent years it proved increasingly ineffective inprotecting against a potentially dangerous influenza virus. Actually, it was worse than ineffective last22 of 26year, Ross said, as federal health officials said it was useless.The spray, best known by the brand name FluMist, was no match for last year's predominant strain,H1N1 - which affects children most adversely - effectively ending its run as the go-to, needle-free fluvaccination, Ross said.In addition to the flu shot, the leading ways to avoid getting infected lie in daily activities, according toDr. Virginia Mary Bieluch, chief of infectious diseases at the Hospital of Central Connecticut. In arecent radio interview, Bieluch recommended practicing good hand hygiene, coughing or sneezinginto your elbow and staying home if you're sick.Hot Topics in Health CareYear in Review: Top 10 Health Stories of 2016Wall Street JournalThe frightening spread of the Zika virus through the Americas. Outrage over soaring EpiPen prices.And more deaths in the U.S. from addictive opioid painkillers. Those are among the past year's bighealth stories. Here are my choices for the top 10:1. Zika virusThe mosquito-borne Zika virus exploded in Brazil, where it was found to cause birth defects in thefetuses of infected women, especially microcephaly. That causes babies to be born with a smallerthan normal head and often leads to intellectual disability. As the virus spread across the Americas,public-health officials issued travel advisories for pregnant women. Mosquito-control efforts werestepped up as the virus made inroads in Florida and Texas, prompting fear in many communities. TheWorld Health Organization in November said Zika is no longer a global health emergency, but still along-term priority. And scientists continue efforts to formulate a vaccine.2. EpiPen pricesPerhaps nothing drew the public's attention to the dramatic rise of prescription drug prices more thana huge jump in the cost of the allergy treatment, which topped $600 this year. That's up 550%since Mylan NV began selling the product in 2007. Anger, including from families of children who mustalways carry the EpiPen lifesaving drug, spurred congressional hearings. Mylan agreed in Octoberto pay $465 million to settle allegations it overcharged the government and recently launched a $300generic version of EpiPen.3. Life expectancyA seeming setback in public health came with the surprising news that the nation's mortality rate rosefor the first time in four decades, mainly due to higher deaths from heart disease and stroke.Americans can now expect to live 78.8 years, down from 78.9 the previous year, the Centers forDisease Control and Prevention said earlier this month. It was the first decline since 1999, andexperts pointed to the obesity epidemic and a rise in diabetes rates as factors behind more heart-disease-related deaths.4. Painkiller addictionThe opioid crisis continued this year with overdose deaths from the highly addictive prescriptionpainkillers reaching all-time highs. Fentanyl, a synthetic, cheap opioid 50 times as powerful as heroin,helped fuel the crisis this year. The epidemic has left an increasing number of children in foster care,23 of 26strained law-enforcement departments and destroyed families. Federal prosecutors are going afterdrug companies and doctors that have contributed to the crisis.5. Gene editingCRISPR-Cas9, a genetic-engineering tool to edit DNA in living organisms, shows promise fordeveloping treatments for diseases, a research effort that is getting funding from the NationalAcademy of Sciences. The technology is also being explored for public-health uses such as killingoff disease-carrying mosquito populations and breeding animals whose organs can be used in humantransplants. As with many lucrative discoveries, investors are pouring money into the technology andcontroversy over who owns the intellectual-property rights has led to a patent dispute.6. Tainted waterTap water with dangerously high lead levels created a public-health crisis in Flint, Mich., and sparkedfears around the country. Blood tests showed elevated lead levels in many children in Flint, which hadchanged its water source in 2014. The Michigan attorney general has lodged criminal charges relatedto the crisis against 13 former and current local and state officials The city has since switched watersources and the percentage of children with high lead levels has declined sharply.7. Transgender healthMedical services and support for transgender people expanded last year. Groups like the AmericanAcademy of Pediatrics expressed support for transgender youth. A study in the journal Pediatrics inMarch found that transgender pre-adolescents have good mental-health outcomes after they transitionsocially to the gender they identify with. And major hospitals and academic centers have begunoffering surgery and other services to transgender people that are increasingly covered by insuranceplans.8. Obamacare woesIt was tough going for the Affordable Care Act, the president's signature health program known asObamacare. Insurers continued to pull out of the program, leaving one-third of U.S. counties with justone insurance company to be listed next year on exchanges where people go to purchase their plans.With president-elect Donald Trump threatening to overturn the ACA, there is widespread uncertaintyover how millions of people enrolled in plans will get health care.9. Screen-time benefitsScreen time may have some benefits after all. The popular Pok\u00e9mon Go game that captured thecountry's attention this summer led to users taking 1,500 more steps a day than usual, according to astudy in the Journal of Medical Internet Research. The average player saw significant boosts inphysical activity for 30 days. Other research shows that making social connections through activity-tracking apps, such as Argus by Azumio, also gets people to move more.10. SleepSleep has increasingly become a public-health issue. Sleep deprivation causes us to gain weight andbecome less emotionally stable, and makes it harder to read other people's facial expressions,research shows. We got even less sleep than usual at times this year due to the stressfulcampaign for U.S. president. For people with insomnia-one third of the population-newrecommendations this year called for managing it with cognitive behavioral therapy rather thanmedications.Hospital industry warns of 'crisis' if health law is repealedHartford CourantThe nation's hospital industry warned President-elect Donald Trump and congressional leaders onTuesday that repealing the Affordable Care Act could cost hospitals $165 billion by the middle of the24 of 26next decade and trigger \"an unprecedented public health crisis.\"The two main trade groups for U.S. hospitals dispatched a letter to the incoming president and CapitolHill's top four leaders, saying that the government should help hospitals avoid massive financiallosses if the law is rescinded in a way that causes a surge of uninsured patients.The letter, along with a consultant's study estimating the financial impact of undoing the AffordableCare Act, makes hospitals the first sector of the health care industry to speak out publicly to try toprotect itself from a sharp reversal in health policy that Trump is promising andcongressional Republicans have long favored.When it was enacted in 2010, the health care law was a product of a delicate balancing act amongvarious parts of the health care industry. Each essentially agreed to sacrifices in exchange for theprospect of millions of Americans gaining insurance to help cover their medical expenses.Since Trump's election last month, most health-industry sectors have quietly been trying to glean- and influence - the thinking within Congress' GOP majority and the president-elect's transition team.America's Health Insurance Plans (AHIP), the insurers' main lobby, has been holding private meetingswith members of Congress. According to an AHIP spokeswoman, the group is urging that a repeal ofthe Affordable Care Act avoid disrupting newly gained coverage, eliminate certain taxes the lawplaced on insurers and replace the requirement that most Americans carry insurance with strongfinancial incentives for coverage.In contrast, the American Hospital Association and the Federation of American Hospitals (FAH)convened a news conference Tuesday to release the study's findings and draw attention to theirconcerns.Charles \"Chip\" Kahn III, president of FAH, a for-profit group, said the amount of money that hospitalscould lose under a repeal of the Affordable Care Act was \"unsettling.\"Joann Anderson, president of Southeastern Health, a financially fragile rural hospital in Lumberton,N.C., one of that state's most economically depressed areas, said the prospect of repealing the healthlaw without a replacement to keep people insured is \"gut-wrenching. ... We cannot take additionalcuts.\"The study, by the health economics consulting firm Dobson DaVanzo, used as its starting point a billthat is the only Affordable Care Act-repeal legislation that Congress has produced. It was vetoed earlythis year by President Barack Obama. That legislation would have eliminated crucial parts of thehealth law - among them, federal subsidies for health plans people buy through insurancemarketplaces created by the law, penalties for violating its insurance requirements, and the expansionof Medicaid that 31 states have adopted.Borrowing from Congressional Budget Office estimates, the study says a similar repeal would causean additional 22 million people to be uninsured by 2026. By then, it predicts, hospitals would lose$165 billion as a result - and $102 billion more unless the government reverses certain payment cutsthe law made to hospitals that treat many uninsured patients.The hospital groups say that if Trump and Congress repeal the Affordable Care Act without replacingit right away, they should also restore government payments for hospital care of Medicare andMedicaid patients to what they were before the 2010 law. When it was enacted, the premise was thathospitals could absorb lower payments if more people were insured.A spokeswoman for House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., noted that Ryan has said he favors atransition period to phase out the law but has not specified how long he prefers. A spokesman forSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said the senator has held over 100 meetings withhospital leaders, employees and patients \"to hear firsthand about the damage the law is doing.\"Spokesmen for the Trump transition team did not answer repeated requests for a reply, except for anote that said: \"We have received your request. Due to the volume of requests coming in, responsetime may be slower than usual.\"25 of 26Coming Events2017 Black & Red Benefiting NeuroscienceSaturday, January 28Save Saturday, January 28, for Hartford Hospital's annual gala, the Black & Red.The Hartford HealthCare Neuroscience Institute at Hartford Hospital will be honored at the event,which will feature entertainment by Fitz & The Tantrums.Business After Hours at the Bloomfield HHC Family Health Center and Medical GroupOfficeWednesday, February 15-7 p.m.2 Northwestern Drive, BloomfieldThe Seymour Street Journal (SSJ) has been developed to communicate key messages pertinent to our hospital'sphysicians.
