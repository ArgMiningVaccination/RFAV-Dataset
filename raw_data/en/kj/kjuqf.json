Origin - Key Ingredients - Formula - Origin This complex, synergistic blend of 20 key ingredients includes botanicals renowned in Ayurveda for supporting men's health. Hemidesmus indicus cools and purifies the genitourinary tract. Orchid tree is famous in Ayurveda for supporting overall prostate health. Guggul supports prostate health and boosts the liver's ability to detox. Both guggl and orchid tree clear ama (toxins) from the blood, muscle, and fat tissue, and help to support the healthy size of the prostate gland by promoting balanced cell production. Boerhavia helps maintain balanced flow of testosterone, and helps maintain healthy urine flow. Prostate Protection is designed to help address imbalances in the prostate, and to support your body's natural intelligence in maintaining prostate health and male reproductive health. The two key ingredients in this formula are kachnar (orchid tree or bauhinia variegata) and guggul (Indian bdellium). Both are famous in Ayurveda for supporting prostate health and function, and in helping to maintain the normal size of the prostate gland. Heart-leaved moonseed (Indian tinospora), turmeric, and zinc help support immunity. The combination of guggul and zinc is a traditional Ayurvedic remedy for balancing the size and health of the prostate. Other herbs in this synergistic formula have been added to enhance the flow of urine; promote prostate comfort; have been traditionally used to support a healthy inflammatory response; promote immunity in the genitourinary tract; and support testosterone levels and sexual desire. This formula was crafted with care in Noida, India. The herbs used in Prostate Protection were harvested at the point of maximum freshness and vitality. With great care and without threatening the natural ecological balance, our herbs are gathered in the wild, because wild-crafted herbs are so much more potent and pure than their cultivated counterparts. After the herbs are harvested, they are inspected by experts in dravyaguna, the Ayurvedic science of identification and use of healing plants. We use traditional methods of extraction and processing. No chemical solvents are used in the extraction process, nor are the herbs exposed to high temperatures that can damage their natural intelligence. Different ingredients or components are added to a formulation at the specific times and temperatures detailed in the texts to maintain the integrity and authenticity of the final formulation. Reviews Russell W. In combination with exercise, this is a good addition. John G. I don't have solid statistical data, but I've kept tract of my psa for about 12 years and it remains under 4. I've also been taking prostate protection from Maharishi Ayurveda for about as long. I also take saw palmetto and pygeum. Safety first. I'll keep taking it. SAH I was taking Saw Palmetto and it kind of worked. I then started to take this supplement and it seems to be working for me. I have been using it for a year. My PSA is still going up but my urgency seems to be reduced and when I have to go it is not as hard. My night trips have gone down from 2-3 to 1-2.
