How to tell if it is a myth or fact: Misinformation vs. Disinformation We hear these words a lot, but what is the difference? Misinformation is information that is false, inaccurate, or misleading according to the best available evidence at the time. Disinformation is a type of misinformation that deliberately tries to trick people into believing something for financial gain or political advantage. Types of Misinformation - Memes with false information - Websites designed to look professional but are not official - Quotations that were changed - Images of out-dated or disproven facts - Misleading graphs - Cherry-picked statistics - Altered Videos Be sure before you share. With so much misinformation, it's important to take the time to make sure what you're sharing is true. Four Steps You Can Take to Combat the Spread of Misinformation - Before sharing, check if the original source is trustworthy and that it's updated on a regular basis. If you're not sure, it's probably not safe to share. - Shocking headline or picture catch your eye? That may be your first clue that something's off. Misinformation often uses sensational or shocking text and images to grab your attention \u2014 accurate information is usually less sensational. - Misinformation often \"cherry picks\" or elevates a small piece of a story to mislead or alarm you. Try to get the full story and context behind a piece of content by checking sources you trust to see if they're also covering the information that you're unsure about. - Have a trustworthy source? Share it. Misinformation spreads faster in the community when there is a shortage of good, fact-based information. What are trusted sources of information? The best place to start is with the CDC. Why? Because the CDC's web content on vaccines and immunization is researched, written, and approved by subject-matter experts, including physicians, researchers, epidemiologists, and analysts. Content is based on peer-reviewed science. Science and public health data are frequently updated, and most pages are reviewed yearly.
