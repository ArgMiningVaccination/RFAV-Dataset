We hope you had a safe and fun Halloween! Read on to learn about our Election Special, acupuncture for stress-relief, self-care tips and herbal tea recipies, LBCA's sick policy, our annual non-perishable food drive, and Thanksgiving week scheduling! Election TLC: The Day-After Special! This election season has been extra stressful for all of us, and we at [LBCA](http://www.littlebirddc.com/) have decided to offer a special day of healing after the election ends. We are offering $15 treatments all day Wednesday, November 9. Come take advantage of this opportunity to heal in community and rest your weary heads and hearts! [Schedule Now!](http://www.littlebirddc.com/make-an-appointment/) Take Care of Yo-Self! Acupuncture, Stress Relief, & Health-Boosting Teas Our #1 recommendation for stress-relief is acupuncture, of course! And why does it work so well? [ Acupuncture slows the body's production of stress hormones](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/03/16/acupuncture-could-help-prevent-stress_n_2883996.html), down-regulates the \"fight or flight\" sympathetic nervous system response, and up-regulates the \"rest and digest\" parasympathetic nervous system response. By soothing the nervous system, acupuncture can be a life-changer when used regularly, because it will help your body reset to a \"new normal\" of calm and relaxation. Think you could use a nervous system reset? Weekly treatments are a good place to start.

Ritual #1? Start each morning by writing down 3 things you are grateful for. This ritual is a method of training your brain to scan for positives instead of negatives, and can have a huge impact on your outlook.

Whether you take 30 seconds to breathe mindfully or take advantage of a 15-minute break to go for a walk, the key is to tune in with your body, notice sights and sounds, & be present with your surroundings.

[Get the Recipe](https://theherbalacademy.com/a-recipe-for-family-friendly-herbal-chai/)! Sick Policy: Can I come in for treatment when I'm sick? While we love to help those suffering from the flu and colds boost their immunity and get better quickly, it is important that we keep the community room contagion-free to protect all of our Little Birds! That means if you are in the contagious stage of your illness, you will need to stay home. We ask that you wait 24 hours after your fever breaks before coming in for a treatment. Also, if you are coughing uncontrollably, vomiting, or having diarrhea, please stay home and rest up. If you come in for treatment and are contagious, we unfortunately will not be able to treat you. We will be happy to help you recover when you are no longer contagious with those wintertime germmies and bugs! Community Giving: LBCA Food Drive As a means of giving back to our larger community, we will once again be hosting a food drive to benefit [Bread for the City](http://www.breadforthecity.org/)! For the entire month of November, Little Bird will be collecting healthful, non-perishable food items for the Bread for the City food program. Please make sure to follow [Bread for the City's guidelines](http://donate.breadforthecity.org/giftsinkind) when selecting food to bring in. With every item donated you will not only be helping someone in need, but you can also enter a raffle to win one of five prizes from Little Bird! One item equals one entry. Prizes are the following: - 1 Acu Pass good for 5 FREE returning patient treatments - 1 Acu Pass good for 1 FREE returning patient treatment - 3 Acu Passes each good for 1 FREE New Patient treatment (a great gift for a friend or loved one) We will contact the raffle winners on Thursday, December 1st! Holiday Hours We will be closed Thursday, November 24 and Friday, November 25 for the holiday, but we will be open Saturday and Sunday so you can get in a nice post-Thanksgiving acunap! Shortened weeks fill up quickly, so make sure to reserve your spot in advance.
