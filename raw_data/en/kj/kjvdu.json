Introduction In 2019, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) broke out,1,2 with a 2% case fatality rate,3causing serious damage to the health and economy of the people in the world.4-6Then, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 as a PublicHealth Emergency of International Concern.7In the absence of a speci c drug to treat cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection,8,9practi- tioners of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) have relied on experiences and prescriptions for preventing and treatingdisease outbreaks garnered from the rich history of TCM. 10,11Keywords COVID-19 TCM clinical trial public health emergencyAbstract Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has played an important role in the prevention and control of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and has received considerable atten-tion from all sectors of society. In the current situation of the global outbreak, it iscrucial to promote the global application of TCM. However, the pandemic has alsoexposed various problems affecting the widespread acceptance of TCM. In this review,we summarize efforts to prevent and control COVID-19 by TCM and provide strategicguidance on how to promote its practice in the context of public health emergencies by (1) completing the system for evaluating the clinical ef cacy of TCM; (2) transforming decoctions into encouraging low-threshold traditionalrehabilitation therapy; (4) strengtheni ng communication and cooperation with the media. The aim of these approaches is to improve the rigor of TCM research and itsdissemination, sharing the antiepidemic experience of TCM to the world, as well as increase the engagement of and acceptance by the masses. In this manner, TCM will notonly aid in preventing and controlling COVID-19 but can also provide tools for copingwith future public health emergencies. received July 14, 2022 The is an open access article published by Thieme under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License, permitting unrestricted use,distribution, and reproduction so long as the original work is properly cited.

Increasing the dissemination of TCM can potential-ly contribute to the prevention and control of COVID-19. In this review, we discuss the work of TCM in this regard and summarize measures to promote the spread of TCM, whichcannot only aid in the management of this epidemic but can also serve as a reference for future public health emergencies. Evaluation of Clinical Ef cacy to Improve the Rigor of Traditional Chinese Medicine Research An important barrier to the acceptance of TCM by medical professionals and the masses is the lack of standardized evidence of its clinical ef cacy.15,16Reports on this topic have mostly been limited to case reports and experiencesharing. Systematically evaluating the therapeutic value of TCM based on empirical evidence is critical for expanding the influence of TCM. 17Overall Status of Registered Trials on Traditional Chinese Medicine for Coronavirus Disease 2019 Since the outbreak of the COVID-19 epidemic, the number of clinical registrations has soared, accompanied by a variety of problems in clinical trial registration. We counted the rst 100 TCM related studies registered since the outbreak. Among them, there are 80 intervention studies on ef cacy evaluation, 72 for treatment, 2 for prevention, and 6 forrehabilitation. Among them, 58 were randomized parallel control studies, and 68 were approved by the clinical ethics committee. The clinical trials and speci c interventions that were evaluated are listed in Table 1 . Problems Exposed by Registered Traditional Chinese Medicine Trial Information Several issues have undermined the rigor of registered TCM trials. First, the basic concepts of placebo and randomizationare unclear in some studies. 18One trial even used boiled water as a placebo. Some of the conducted trials were not registered or did not strictly adhere to ethical standards. Forexample, in one study, the control group did not receive any treatment. Second, there are signi cant variations in the primary and secondary outcome measures. For example,some studies used C-reactive protein as an in flammation- related indicator, whereas others used procalcitonin, cyto- kines, and other markers ( Fig. 1 ), making it dif cult to compare the results of different trials. Third, with the excep- tion of Chinese patent medicines and Qingfei Paidu decoc- tion, the details of most TCM interventions are unclear, andspeci c syndrome differentiation, prescriptions, and dosage are not reported, which hinders the sharing of clinical data. 19 Fourth, outcome evaluation of most clinical studies includes only biological indicators, while TCM-associated syndromes have been omitted,20with the result that certain TCM resources have been squandered. Last, most studies have Table 1 Registered clinical study of novel coronavirus pneumonia treated by TCM Study type Experimental designTotal numberEthical approvalIntervention measures Maxing Shigan Decoction TiaoxinNon-RCT 9 Continuous entry Single trial 6 Rehabilitation RCT 6 6/6 Taijiquan, Health Qigon g and lung nourishing intervention, TCM nursing Prevention RCT 2 TCM, traditional Chinese medicine; RCT: randomized controlled trial.

The Author(s).Application of Chinese Medicine During the Epidemic of COVID-19 Geng et al. e194 not monitored adverse reactions and toxic effects of TCM treatment. Thus, the safety of TCM remains undetermined. Suggestions on Improving the State of Traditional Chinese Medicine Clinical Research The emergence of the new coronavirus epidemic has posed a major public health challenge. For the clinical value of TCM to be widely accepted, trials must be designed so that theyadhere to the principles of evidence-based medicine and are guided by professional methodological teams to avoid wast- ing resources. Low-quality research not only exacerbates theproblem of resource shortage but also undermines the quality of TCM clinical research. We propose that govern- ment administrative departments organize clinical trialevaluations, tighten the checks of clinical trial registration and ethics committees, and focus research efforts. Research groups should increase cooperation and the sharing of clini- cal data and follow standardized trial protocols to facilitate data integration and follow-up. 18At the same time, TCM- associated syndromes and the advantages and outcome measures of TCM must be more clearly de ned to modernize this practice and enhance its value.19 Transforming Decoctions into Chinese Patent Medicines Chinese patent medicines have played an important role in the management of COVID-19 according to the Diagnosis and Treatment Plan for Pneumonia Infected by New Coronavi- rus.21-26Chinese patent medicines were crazily purchased in previous epidemics include \"Banlangen Event \"for SARS and \"Shuanghuanglian Oral Solution Event \"for New Coronal Pneumonia.27The willingness of the masses to purchase these Chinese patent medicines during public health crisesdemonstrates that they can be readily disseminated. Chinese Patent Medicines Can Increase the Age Range of Traditional Chinese Medicine Users We used the Baidu Index to evaluate the level of interest of Baidu users in Chinese patent medicines and traditionaldecoctions recommended for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19 during the epidemic by using the Target groupindex (TGI). We term \"Chinese patent medicine \"was directly searched to determine the degree of active interest in TCM. The audience of four epidemic-related traditional decoctions was mainly persons >40 years of age (TGI >100), with relatively little attention paid by adults between the ages of 20 and 40 years (TGI <100; Fig. 2 ). The age range of Baidu users who searched for information on the ve epi- demic-related Chinese patent medicines was broader ( >20 years), whereas searches of the term \"Chinese patent med- icines \"were more common in persons under the age of 30 years. We suggest that interest in Chinese patent medi- cines can compensate for the lack of attention to traditionaldecoctions in persons <40 years old and can encourage acceptance of TCM across all age groups. Conversion of Decoctions into Chinese Patent Medicines and Strengthening the Rationale for Using Chinese Patent Medicines Classic formulations are processed and concentrated for transformation into Chinese patent medicines, which not only retain the active ingredients of the original decoctionbut also eliminate the preparation time and facilitate their transport and intake, 28thus making them more appealing to the public. Compared with oral forms, injectable Chinesemedicinals have a more rapid onset of therapeutic effects and are amenable to mass production, 29and their administration is more convenient. Thus, promoting the transformation ofeffective formulations and dosage forms and expanding the coverage of Chinese patent medicines can increase the widespread adoption of TCM practices. However, misuse of Fig. 1 Interaction of in flammation-related indicators between registered TCM studies of new coronary pneumonia. ( A) Collaborative relationship of four indicators among studies. ( B) Quantitative relationship of four 2 No. 4/2022 \u00a9 2022. The Author(s).Application of Chinese Medicine During the Epidemic of COVID-19 Geng et al. e195 these agents because of their ease of distribution must be avoided. For example, for COVID-19, there was a blind rush by the public to purchase Shuanghuanglian oral liquid to protect against coronavirus infection without informed guidance,27leading to cases of gastrointestinal adverse reactions. This underscores the importance of educatingthe masses on the safe and appropriate use of Chinese patent medicines. Pharmaceutical supervision departments should also increase their scrutiny of the directions for the use ofChinese patent medicines (especially dosing for special groups such as pregnant women and children) and more closely monitor and record adverse reactions and drug -drug interactions 30,31; this can strengthen the rationale for pre- scribing these medicines and enhance their safety, while providing a reference to the masses for making informedchoices regarding treatment options. Engaging the Masses with Low-Threshold Traditional Rehabilitation Therapy The Guiding Recommendations for TCM Rehabilitation in the Recovery Period of New Coronavirus Pneumonia (Trial) for- mulated by the State Administration of TCM describe six suitable types of TCM for controlling COVID-19, namely,moxibustion therapy, acupoint massage, ear point pressing beans, scraping, cupping, and acupuncture therapy, along with two traditional exercises, namely, Baduanjin and Taiji-quan ( Table 2 ).32Traditional rehabilitation therapy, which is based on TCM theory, is a means of improving patients ' physical and mental health and quality of life not only by relieving their physical pain and mental distress but also by increasing their con dence in overcoming the disease. Promoting the Spread of Traditional Chinese Medicine Through Traditional Rehabilitation Therapy Appropriate techniques of TCM and traditional exercises have played an important role in promoting TCM. The merits of the former which includes acupuncture are recognized worldwide33-35; and the latter are readily accepted by the masses because of their low threshold, time commitment, and energy consumption, and alignment with national healthcare consciousness.36COVID-19 is a test for the TCM system and a good opportunity for its promulgation. Baduan- jin, a TCM health exercise, was shown to exert a synergistic effect on the recovery of vital energy in patients with COVID-19 by mobilizing the whole body through coordinated move- ments to enhance physical strength, blood oxygenation, and immune function. In Jiangxia Dahuashan Square Cabin Hos-pital, traditional Kung Fu Baduanjin and breathing and turning exercises were widely adopted by patients and healthcare workers. 37Traditional rehabilitation therapy is simple, effective, convenient, and inexpensive and can improve malaise symptoms such as fatigue and shortness of breath in patients with COVID-19.38 Fig. 2 The popularity of Chinese patent medicine and traditional decoction for prevention and treatment of COVID-19 among people of all ages. The target group index (TGI) information comes from Baidu Index, which is collected from February 7 to March 7, 2020. Bule lines: traditional decoction; Red lines: Chinese patent medicines. When the target group index equals 100, it represents the average level. If the TGI is higher than 100, it means that the user 's attention to certain drugs is higher than the overall leve l. Gray areas indicate that people are less concerned about the drug than average (TGI <100). Chinese Medicine and Natural Products V ol. 2 No. 4/2022 \u00a9 2022. The Author(s).Application of Chinese Medicine During the Epidemic of COVID-19 Geng et al. e196 Encouraging Mass Participation in Traditional Rehabilitation Therapy Promoting traditional rehabilitation therapy by increasing the participation of the masses requires the joint efforts ofthe government, community, media, primary medical units, health care workers, and other parties. 39Government departments should strengthen guidance, improve relevantrules and regulations, and ensure the orderly and coordinat- ed development of traditional rehabilitation therapy at all levels of operation from medical units to communities. 40The community can adopt certain measures to advertise tradi- tional rehabilitation therapy such as Baduanjin that has a low threshold and can thus be readily propagated among com-munities and individuals. Also, the media and journalists can actively report the advantages of traditional rehabilitation therapy such as simplicity, convenience, effectiveness, andlow cost and thereby gradually increase the awareness of traditional rehabilitation therapy among the masses through various media channels such as radio, news, microblog, andthe WeChat social media platform. Moreover, grassroots medical units should be equipped with doctors trained in traditional rehabilitation therapy who can carry out therelevant work, are knowledgeable, and contribute to the advancement of TCM. 41Health care workers should be mindful of and open to traditional rehabilitation therapy.On the one hand, they should use it to relieve physical pain in patients; at the same time, they should be aware of its equal importance for mental health. Strengthening Communication and Cooperation with Media to Improve Public Opinion of Traditional Chinese Medicine As an intermediary between the medical profession and general public, the media play an important role in publiciz-ing the effects of TCM treatments and can in fluence the perceptions, emotions, and decisions of the general public. 42 Accurate reporting of TCM can thus aid in epidemic preven- tion and control, while misinformation can cause panic and exacerbate epidemics. Influence of False Media Reports on the Public 's Opinion of TCM There have been inaccurate news reports related to TCM in the context of COVID-19, two of which are highlighted here. Therst report that Shuanghuanglian can inhibit the new coronavirus was published in the People 's Daily (Sina Weibo topic with 2.22 billion views).27The reporter did not mention the limitations of the study, such as the effect was observed only in vitro, resulting in a blind rush by the public toTable 2 Traditional rehabilitation therapy and guidance recommendations in \"guideline recommendations for TCM rehabilitation in COVID-19 (Trial) \" Categories Therapy sortsDetails etc.Add Shaoshang (LU 11), Chize (LU 5) if coughing, dry coughing or throat itching Meridian massage: lung meridian of hand-Taiyin, large intestine meridian of hand- Yangming, stomach meridian of foot-Yangming, spleen meridian of foot-Taiyin, conception meridian and governor meridian etc. Auricular point press- beansCommon point, Shenmen point, occiput point, spleen point, stomach point, la rge intestine point and sympathy point etc. Scraping Lung meridian of hand-Taiyin,large intestine meridian of hand-Yangming,urinary 13), Zusanli(ST and Guanyuan(CV etc. Syndrome matching Add Geshu(BL 17), Shenshu (BL 23) and Dachangshu (BL 25) if feeling weakness, cold-fearing and having pale tongue.

Note: This guidance applies to the people in the recovery phase who meet the criteria for decoupling and discharge from the COVID-19 diagnosis andtreatment program. Clinicians can refer to this guidance and give relevant treatment or rehabilitation guidance according to the individual situat ion of the patient. After discharge, patients can also adopt appropriate self-intervention methods according to this recommendation. Chinese Medicine and Natural Products Vol. 2 No. 4/2022 \u00a9 2022. The Author(s).Application of Chinese Medicine During the Epidemic of COVID-19 Geng et al. e197 purchase and use Shuanghuanglian in a misguided attempt to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection. Moreover, this led to amass public gathering during the COVID-19 outbreak, de- spite the fact that self-isolation is a better strategy to decrease the risk of infection. The second report that thetension of patients with COVID-19 was alleviated after taking TCM was published by the China News Network (Sina Weibo topic with 350 million views). 43Huang Luqi, a researcher at the Chinese Academy of Engineering and president of the Chinese Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences, originally stated that \"the people are in urgent need of TCM, and they are at ease under the protection of TCM. \"Unfortunately, an incorrect interpretation of this statement by the media resulted in the public believing that TCM is no better than aplacebo. Suggestions on Strengthening Communication and Cooperation Between Proponents of Traditional Chinese Medicine and the Media During an outbreak, the public is highly sensitive to relevant information and any misinformation can lead to collective irrational actions. Many people blindly listen to rumors that could require considerable effort to address and refute.44 This is detrimental not only to the management of the epidemic but also to public con dence in the medical community. Acceptance by and engagement of the masses is essential for expanding the in fluence of TCM.45Experts in TCM should strengthen communication and cooperation with the media,validate information on TCM from the medical and public opinion perspectives, use easy-to-understand language in communications about TCM, and be mindful of the subjectcharacteristics of TCM. At the same time, the government must improve systems for monitoring and transmitting accurate information and countering false information and provide guidance to the public for identifying the relevant aspects of TCM. 46Finally, the use of professional and precise language and responsible actions by the media can help expand the reach of TCM. Outlook Since the outbreak of COVID-19, TCM has played an impor- tant role in the prevention and control of the outbreak. However, due to the particularity of the theoretical system of TCM and the insuf cient understanding of the theoretical knowledge of TCM by the masses, the dissemination quality and ef ciency of TCM are hindered to a certain extent, and the acceptance and recognition among the masses are re-duced. It is urgent to improve the rigor of TCM research and promote the dissemination effect, which cannot only make TCM fully exert its ef cacy and value in this global antiepi- demic work, but also promote the inheritance and innova- tion of TCM. We should gradually improve the evaluation system of clinical ef cacy of TCM, promote the conversion of TCM Decoction to Chinese patent medicine, and promote low-threshold traditional rehabilitation therapy, at the same time, strengthen communication and cooperation betweenthe media, so as to expand the dissemination degree and influence of TCM. By further promoting and sharing with the world 's medical workers the experience and programs of TCM in ghting the epidemic, we can really push the inheritance, innovation, and development of TCM to a newstage so that TCM not only plays an important role in the prevention and control of the new coronary pneumonia epidemic but also contributes to human health.
