Please remember the journey to good health is a process. What happens? During your first appointment I take a detailed health history. I spend time understanding your health needs to identify the most appropriate detox remedies. Your prescription will detail the specific remedies to take including dosage and frequency. It will also include information on why you have been prescribed specific remedies. Working with me is a partnership and I believe it is important for you to understand why you are taking particular remedies and the curative action of them. At following appointments we discuss how you are feeling and note changes in your health and well-being. Your prescription will be adjusted to match your current health needs.
