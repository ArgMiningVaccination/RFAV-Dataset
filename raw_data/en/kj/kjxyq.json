If a non-mainstream practice is used together with conventional medicine, it's considered \"complementary.\" If a non-mainstream practice is used in place of conventional medicine, it's considered \"alternative.\" There are many definitions of \"integrative\" health care, but all involve bringing conventional and complementary approaches together in a coordinated way. The use of integrative approaches to health and wellness has grown within care settings across the United States. Researchers are currently exploring the potential benefits of integrative health in a variety of situations, including pain management for military personnel and veterans, relief of symptoms in cancer patients and survivors, and programs to promote healthy behaviors. In Asia, integrative medicine has been the most common practice for many years. [TOP OF PAGE](#top) SELECTED BOOKS Chinese herbal drug research trends. Edited by Felix M. Ching.
