Disagreements discussion. To prevent conflict ofinterest, studies written by review authors were assessed byothermembersoftheauthorteam. Mixed-effects meta-analyses were performed using the R Metafor package 22for pain and opioid dose outcomes. After sending email requests for missing data to authorsof studies included in the review who did not providesufficient data in the original publication, 29 studies 19,23-50 were included in the pain meta-analysis and 8 stu-dies 29,30,35,37-39,42,43in the opioid dose meta-analysis. In studies with more than 1 MBT arm, data from both MBTswere included. Studies that reported Pvalues but did not report numerical means and SDs for baseline or postinter-vention pain or opioid use could not be included in themeta-analysis. Pain values were standardized using a 0- to10-point numeric rating scale, and opioid dose was stan-dardized into morphine equivalents using standard equian-algesic conversion tables. 7Change scores were created by subtracting the baseline value from the most proximalpostintervention end point; this end point was selectedbecauseitwasconsistentlycollecteddespitegreatvariabilityin time points across studies. The SDs of the change scoreswere imputed via Cochrane best practices. 51Effect size estimates were calculated as standardized mean dif-ferences. 22Study heterogeneity was investigated using Bau- jat plots in conjunction with the Qand I2statistics.52,53Pub- lication bias was examined with funnel plots and the Eggertest. 53,54Althoughweperformedquantitativemeta-analyses on all studies for which we could extract data, the entirebody of studies was systematically reviewed in a qualitativemanner (summary study data 19,23-50,55-86are presented in Table 1 and detailed study data in the eMethods in the Supplement ).Results Overview of Studies Wescreened4212citationsand603full-textarticles.Sixtystud- ieswithatotalof6404participantswereultimatelyincludedinthereview(Figure1).The60studiesfocusedonvariousclini-calpaintargets:proceduralpain(n = 39),burnpain(n = 7),can-cerpain(n = 5),chronicpain(n = 8),orheterogeneousacutepain conditions (n = 1).

Overall Meta-analysis Characteristics of the Overall Meta-analysis Two meta-analyses were performed on all studies for which datacouldbeextractedtodeterminetheassociationofMBTswithreducedpainandopioiduse.InspectionofBaujatplots(eFigure6inthe Supplement )revealedthat2studies, 23,24both ofwhichdemonstratedsignificantclinicalefficacyinfavorofMBTs,wereappropriateforremovalasoutliers:1inthepainmeta-analysisand1intheopioidusemeta-analysis.Wechoseto remove those studies to obtain stable and 87 Pain-Related Outcome Results Overall, MBTs had a significant, small association with opi- oid use (Cohen d= 0.26; .82) and I2 (0.0%) showed homogeneity of effect sizes. These datawerederivedfrom8distinctstudies(n = 435),with250patients receiving an MBT. A funnel plot (eFigure P= .76)didnot indicatepublicationbias. Discussion To our knowledge, this study represents the first systematicevaluation of the therapeutic benefits of MBTs for opioid-treatedclinicalpaininstudiesincludingmorethan6000pa-tients. Overall meta-analytic results revealed that MBTs hadastatisticallysignificant,moderateassociationwithreduced painintensityandastatisticallysignificant,smallassociationwithreducedopioiddosingcomparedwitharangeofcontrolarms.ThestrengthoftheevidenceforthetherapeuticeffectsofMBTsonpainandopioiddosereductionwasmoderate,al-thoughthisevidencevariedbyspecificMBT.Takentogetherwith descriptive results from this systematic review, MBTsoverall may be associated with improved pain and opioid-related outcomes for a variety of painful health conditions.Moststudiesusedactiveorplacebocontrolsandhadlowriskof bias ( Figure 3 and eFigures 9-14 in the Supplement ), in- creasing confidence that the reported benefits are not solelytheresultofnonspecifictherapeuticfactors. Fromamoregranularperspective,differencesemergedre- gardingtheefficacyofthespecifictypesofMBTsstudied.Moststudies of meditation, hypnosis, and CBT reported signifi-cant therapeutic associations with opioid-related outcomes,includingopioiddosing,craving,andopioidmisuse,whereascomparatively fewer studies of suggestion, imagery, and re-laxation reported significant associations with opioid-related outcomes. Of note, 2 studies 37,74reported signifi- cantly worsened opioid dosing outcomes after relaxation,suggesting the possibility of adverse effects. However, few studies reported adverse effects or harms of MBTs. Becauseofinsufficientstatisticalpowerfromthepaucityofstudiesre-portingopioiddosedata,wecouldnotconductseparatemeta-analysesforeachtypeofMBTonopioiddosing.

Most of the meditation-based interventionstudies focused on treating chronic noncancer pain (eg, lowbackpain).Incontrast,mosthypnosis,relaxation,imagery,andsuggestion studies focused on treating acute, procedural, orcancer-related pain.

Recommendations for future research are detailed in Table 2. Future studies should collect data needed to obtain quantitativeestimatesofopioiddosing,includingopioidtype,dose per unit, dosage form, dosage frequency, and durationof use.

We could not draw quantitative conclusions about outcome modifiers, such as dose or deliv-ery format, or about durability of treatment effects becauseof high levels of study heterogeneity. Outcomes rangedfrom immediate postintervention acute pain outcomes tooutcomes that lasted 3 months or longer. Approximatelyone-third of studies had small samples and therefore mayhave been underpowered. Although most studies had lowrisk of bias, a number of trials had biases, such as lack ofblinding of participants, personnel, and/or outcomes asses-sors, and lack of intention-to-treat analysis. Given thatnearly approximately half of the trials reviewed were con-ducted before publication of the revised CONSORT state-ment in 2001, 95some studies were missing clinical trial reporting information. Funnel plots and the Egger statisticindicated some publication bias for meditation and sugges-tion studies.Another limitation was the insufficient reporting of opi- oiddosingintheMBTliterature.Anumberofstudies,includ-inghigh-impacttrials, 96couldnotbeincludedbecausethetype of analgesic was unspecified and/or outcomes for us-erswerenotanalyzedseparately.Ofthetrialsreviewed,lessthan one-fifth yielded opioid dosing data of sufficient detailtobemeta-analyzed.
