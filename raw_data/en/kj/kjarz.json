I wanted to getback to the things I did prior to goingon dialysis in 1998. Although I hadthe desire, I just couldn't seem to getthe actual plan going. My son started taking tae kwon do in October 2000. While I sat on the side-lines, I became fascinated watchingthe students develop their skills. Istarted wondering if I could do it. InFebruary 2002, I finally got up thecourage to start taking classes. I'll admit I was intimidated because I feltthat I had to be the oldest and mostout-of-shape student to ever start amartial arts training program. I finallyrationalized that the worst thing thatcould happen was that I would findout really quickly that I didn't havethe stamina to keep up with the rest ofthe students. I guess, at the time, deepdown I really didn't believe I couldphysically do it. What a surprise! With the guidance and encouragement from my instruc-tors and fellow students, I becamestronger and could go further witheach class. I also discovered achesand pains in places I didn't knowexisted. My sore muscles even hadsore muscles. I usually felt like awalking toothache the morning aftereach class, but I also looked forwardto going back for more. I startedworking out two or three times aweek. I had a treadmill at home, butuntil now had always found a reasonnot to exercise. As the weeks went by, my weight started dropping and I started to feelbetter, both physically andmentally. Ifound it easierto get my (likemowing thelawn and otherhousehold chores). The big surprise came when I went for my six-month checkup. Not onlyhad I lost weight, but my labs lookedbetter than ever. My cholesterol leveland blood pressure were down, andthe rest of my lab values were exactlyon target. Before I started sparring, Italked to my transplant nurse abouttechniques to protect my kidney. Mostimportantly, the other students werecourteous and cooperative. My stand-ing joke was \"If you take out my kidney then I get one of yours.\" Ithelped get their attention.

Shroeder, MS, RN, CNS Warmth is one method to help con- nect a couple. So what is warmth?Warmth is the glue that bonds ustogether in a relationship. It's themagnetism that draws us in to closerintimacy with each other. Warmth makes us feel welcomed by each other, relaxed and joyful. It isthat sense that your partner is gladyou are there. Warmth is one way wetell someone we love them and careabout them. Warmth and caring in arelationship provide support for bothpartners. So how do you communicate in a car- ing way to your partner? Respect for your partner communicates accept-ance of their ideas, feelings and expe-riences. Showing respect communi-cates that we value you as a person.It says: \"You are important to me.\" How do you show respect in your relationship? It's the little things you do like: jLooking at your partner when you talk to them. jOffering them your undivided attention. jMaintaining eye contact. jSmiling at them when appropriate. jConnecting with them by touch, such as a hug or pat on the back.Another way to show caring in a relationship is to give your partnerreassurance. Take the time to rein-force your partner's good qualities: jCompliment them on their abilities and talents. jTake the time to reinforce all of the good qualities that attracted you to each other. jTell your partner what you appreci- ate about them. jRemind them that you do care about them. jConcentrate on the positives when you talk to each other. jFocus on the unique gifts your partner brings to your relationship. Improving Daily Communication as a Couple Create an open-minded , loving atti- tude toward your partner. Believe thatyour partner has your best interests inmind. So give each other the benefitof the doubt. Because life is very busy, it is impor- tant to keep in touch. You can nurtureyour relationship by keeping yourpartner informed about what is goingon with you on a daily basis. You cancreate a message center or calendar tokeep each other informed. Watch out for generalizations in your conversations with each other. Avoidstatements like, \"He or she never lis-tens.\" This automatically puts up awall between the two of you. Many minor disagreements and com- munication breakdowns happenbecause one person is feelingunloved. The more you can start aconversation with \"I appreciate youand love you,\" the less often you will end up misunderstanding each other. T rustis an expectation, often unspoken, that someone will be there for you.Trust can be broken, physically, emo-tionally and spiritually. What can youdo to foster trust in your relationship?Talking with each other in a caring waycan facilitate trust. Telling the truthwith each other is the place to start.Then look at these five ingredients for developing trust in a relationship: 1.Say what you are going to do. Communicating to your partnereliminates the guesswork. 2.Do what you say. Have your actions match yourwords. 3.Live in the present. Keep in the present and don't keeptrack of your partner's previousfaults. 4.Look at yourself first. Before pointing a finger at yourpartner, consider your own behav-ior. What is your behavior sayingto your partner? 5.Time, time and more time. Time plays a major role in thedevelopment and strengthening of trust. So how do you create a caring rela- tionship with your partner? Communication is the key. Other qualities that will help make yourrelationship successful are:ONE IMPORTANT THING that can either enhance or hinder a roman-tic or sexual relationship iscommunication. Communi-cation is the key to a caringrelationship.

Congestion (stuffy nose or sinus) Decongestants are the most commonOTC treatment for congestion. Thesemedicines are taken orally or appliedtopically in the nose in the form ofsprays or drops. The main active ingre-dients in OTC decongestants includepseudoephedrine, phenylephrine,oxymetazoline and naphazoline. Thesemedications work decrease conges-tion by shrinking the blood vessels ofthe sinuses. An unwanted effect ofthese medicines is higher blood pres-sure, as they can also shrink or reducethe size of blood vessels outside of thesinuses. Because of the risk of higherblood pressure, these medicines shouldnot be used by people who are beingtreated for high blood pressure, espe-cially if the blood pressure is not wellcontrolled. An alternative to decongestants is diphenhydramine (Benadryl), an anti-histamine. While antihistamines mayhelp with congestion, they are morefamiliar as medications used to treat arunny nose or sneezing caused by aller-gies and as a sleep aid. Becausedrowsiness can occur with antihista-mines, caution should be taken whendriving or using machinery. A second alternative is the use of a saline nasal spray to help loosen nasalsecretions and soothe irritated nasalpassages.A doctor's advice should be sought if congestion does not go away afterseven to 10 days, or if a fever is also present. Cough Two types of products are used to helpwith cough; expectorants and antitus-sives. by lotsof mucous in the lungs. Antitussivesare best for nonproductive coughs,where there is little or no mucous (adry cough). Guaifenesin is the only OTC expecto- rant available. Taking an expectorantfor a productive cough may help thinmucous in the lungs, making it easierto clear. While guaifenesin is well tol-erated and can be taken without regardto prescription medicines, it may bethat simply drinking more water duringa productive cough will help loosen themucous and relieve the cough. OTC antitussives include dextrome- thorphan, diphenhydramine, and, insome states, codeine. These drugs areused to relieve dry, nonproductivecoughs. They should not be taken whenthe cough is productive. Antitussives may be safely taken with most prescription and OTC medica-tions, except for MAO inhibitor med-ications. MAO inhibitors are used for anumber of reasons. If you have beenplaced on this type of medication, bothyour doctor and pharmacist shouldhave already counseled you on medica-tions and foods to avoid. All types ofcough products do have the potential tocause drowsiness. Other options to relieve cough include the use of cough drops, humidifiers andvapor rubs to help soothe irritatedthroats and airways. When treating cough with OTC prod-ucts, it is important to remember that ifthe cough persists for longer than fiveto seven days, worsens within this timeperiod, or is accompanied by a fever,evaluation by a doctor is necessary . Pain and Fever Several products are available to treat pain and fever associated with coldsand flu. Most transplant centers willrecommend acetaminophen as the onlyacceptable medicine for aches, painsand fevers patients. medicines, ketoprofen (allknown as NSAIDs) and aspirin canalso relieve such symptoms, but theyare more likely to interact withimmunosuppressive medicines pre-scribed to transplant patients. Specifi-cally, the combination of the abovementioned pain relievers with cyclos-porine or tacrolimus can worsen kidneyfunction. For this reason, they shouldbe avoided. Aspirin may be recom-mended by your doctor for reasonsother than pain, for instance to protectthe heart. In these cases, the daily dosesare lower than those used for pain andthe benefits to the heart outweigh therisks to the kidney. When using acetaminophen (Tylenol) to treat pain or fever, it is important toremember that too much can causeliver dysfunction. The maximum doseper day for an average-size adult is4000 mg while the maximum dose perday for children and smaller individualsis based upon body weight and can bedetermined by asking your pharmacistor doctor. This dose of acetaminophenshould not be taken on a regular basisbut only as needed for short periods of time. Pain and fever should be reported to your physician or transplant team immediately. The physicians will be able to help you determine the cause ofyour pain and the appropriate and safesolution.An Over-the-Counter Medication Review I By Jennifer Nieman, Doctor of Pharmacy Candidate, and Dean Collier, PharmD IT IS COMMONLY THOUGHT that because a medication doesn't require a prescription, it must be safe. Continued on page 13Transplant Chronicles, Vol. 12, No. 2 5People are living longer! In the United States, the average life expectancy rose dramatically from 54years of age in 1920 to 77 years in2000. Now, in 2005, the fastest grow-ing group of elderly people is over theage of 85 years and they are beingcalled the \"oldest old.\" The goodnews is that solid organ transplantrecipients are living longer also!Transplant programs are now witness-ing 10-year, 15-year and 20-year sur-vivors. As a result, the age of many ofthese patients may be 70 years ormore. This presents a new challengeto transplant patients and their med-ical teams. Besides the usual trans-plant problems of infection, rejectionand the many medications and their side effects, the effects of age-relatedchanges may complicate the plan ofcare, making the assessment of whatis \"normal\" vs. \"abnormal\" harder. We all know about the obvious physi- cal changes that happen to everyone,such as wrinkling and sagging of theskin and the graying, thinning, andloss of hair. You may also realize thatyour senses, such as eyesight, hearing,touch and taste will change and thatyour muscle strength will decreaseand bones will weaken. This mayhave already happened with long-termuse of your immunosuppressant med-ications so your chances of havingproblems as you age increase. Your ability to balance and walk may alsobe altered and, as a result, the possi-bility for you to fall may increase (ie.,in the USA, falls are the seventh lead-ing cause of death in people over 65years of age). In fact, every system inthe body is affected by aging, and thiscan affect the ability to care for one'sself. Because of this, it is importantfor transplant patients and their transplant teams to be aware of theexpected changes that occur withaging and begin to prepare in order to hopefully prevent problems beforethey occur. And remember, anyone,transplant recipient or not, might needto consider these issues ! The Graying of the Transplant Population: No One is Immune to Old Age I By Debi H. Dumas-Hicks, RN, BS, CCTC Continued on page 6eating righteating right Nutrition Counseling\u2014It's Your Right I By Kay Atkins, MS, RD The law for Medical Nutrition Therapy (MNT) being paid for byMedicare became effective in January2002. Only two illnesses areaffected: 1.) Chronic kidneydisease and kidney transplanta-tion and 2.) diabetes. As of2005, high-risk screening fordiabetes and heart disease isalso covered. MNT, which may include diet counseling, is designed to helpyou learn to eat right, so youcan better manage your illness.With a doctor's referral andwritten prescription, Medicarewill cover 80 percent of the cost of MNT for people with diabetes, withchronic kidney disease, or who arepost-kidney transplant, after they pay their annual Part B deductibles. Medicare will generally cover three hours of medical nutrition therapy forthe first year and two hours everyyear thereafter. It may cover morehours if your doctor says you need them. In order to have Medicare cover MNT, a registered dieti-tian must provide these services.Talk to your doctor if you thinkyou qualify for this benefit. Adapted from the Medicare Rights Center Web site: www.medicareinteractive.org ICAN'T TELL YOU how many times the doctors and nurses have called me to the transplant clinic to counsel a recipi- ent about nutrition. As a registered dietitian I can help by: Assisting you in changing your diet Helping you to better control your blood sugars Helping to treat and manage disease conditions with proper nutrition Reducing or cutting out your need for prescription drugs Assisting you in reducing unpleasant side effects from your disease Overall, helping to improve your health and life through proper nutrition.6 Transplant Chronicles, Vol. 12, No. 2The purpose of receiving an organ transplant was to continue to participate in life with your family and friends. It is imperative to follow your transplant team's advice and to communicate to them problems that you are experiencing.After all of your efforts to protect your transplanted organ, don't let aging catch you unprepared! Action Plan For Aging Transplant Recipients Update Your Support Systems When you were being evaluated for your transplant, youwere asked to identify people who would help you afteryour transplant. These people may have changed throughthe years, so the first area you want to address in plan- ning for \"old age\" are your support systems. Your socialnetwork may need to be widened to accommodate futureneeds. The support persons you identified at the time ofyour transplant may have changed and/or probably willchange in the future. Potential Problems: 1.) Spouse not available\u2014divorce; illness; death2.) Children not available\u2014may have moved away; may have their own families and jobs; illnesses 3.) Your parents, if alive, may need YOUR care. 4.) Church /Community\u2014don't feel comfortable asking anyone to help Action Plan: Don't assume someone will be there for you! Be pro-active in your future! 1.)Meet with your family and friends. Ask \"what if\" questions: \u0014What if your spouse becomes ill? Is a friend avail- able to help? \u0014What if you become the \"caregiver\" for your fam- ily? What can you do or not do with the normalhousehold routines? \u0014What if you and your spouse cannot drive any- more? Is transportation available? \u0014Can you make a \"pact\" with neighbors and other members of your community to help each other? And the list goes on and on, depending on your circum-stances .... 2.)Create a list of community resources. \u0014Check with your transplant social worker for guidance. \u0014Call your local government for numbers for serv- ices offered for the elderly. \u0014Check the Web for ideas and services. (Note: A good inclusive site: www.aarp.org/internet resources/ )Your Living Space: \"Elder-Proof\" Your Home The second large area that you need to address is your living space. Your goal should be to reduce hazards inyour home to prevent injuries, especially fractures, whichare a major cause of mortality in the elderly. It isimportant to simplify your lifestyle in order to aid youand others assisting you in the event that your vision andother senses deteriorate. Potential Problems: 1.) Major hazards for falls/fracture s \u0014 Stairs \u0014Slippery floors and throw rugs \u0014Poor lighting \u0014Too high or too low shelves, chairs, beds, etc. Action Plan: Start now to fix your home! Get help! 1.)Assess your home for major hazards and ask \"what if\" questions: \u0014What if you became immobile? Could you use a wheelchair in your home? \u0014What if your vision becomes impaired? Could you easily find what you need to care for yourself? \u0014What if your hearing becomes impaired? How will you know if the phone and/or doorbell isringing, smoke alarm is buzzing? \u0014What if your sense of smell is impaired...how will you know if there is a gas leak? 2.) Start slowly to give away and/or store items you don't need every day. 3.) Fix or get rid of the obvious problems such as slip- pery throw rugs, unstable chairs and tables and furniture that obstructs your path in your home. And the list goes on and on.... Debi H. Dumas-Hicks RN, BS, CCTC, is a Senior Heart Transplant Coordinator at Ochsner Multi-Organ TransplantCenter, New Orleans, LA. TCContinued from page 5 Transplant Chronicles, Vol. 12, No. 2 7New Secretary of the Department of Health andHuman Services Mike Leavitt, the former adminis- trator of the EnvironmentalProtection Agency, has replacedTommy Thompson as Secretary ofthe Department of Health andHuman Services. In his testimonybefore the Finance CommitteeConfirmation Hearing, Leavitt listed welfare reform, Medicare,Medicaid and health care afford-ability as high on his agenda.Leavitt's views on organ donationwere not discussed during his hear-ing. However, as Governor of Utah,Leavitt and his wife Jackie weresaid to be among the first to sign upfor the state's organ donor registry. \"Breakthrough Collaborative\" The Breakthrough Collaborative isa partnership committed to spread-ing known best practices to theNation's largest hospitals to achieveorgan donation rates of 75 percentor higher in these hospitals. In the12 months since the launch of theBreakthrough Collaborative, therecord for most donors in a monthwas broken five times and the aver-age number of donors throughoutthe country increased substantiallyfor the first time in a decade. When asked why this unprecedent- ed increase in donation took placewhen so many other initiatives andprojects have not in the past, JimBurdick, MD, the Director of theHealth Resources and ServicesAdministration (HRSA) Division of Transplantation (DoT), said that abig reason was that the current pro-gram includes all corners of thetransplant community. Examples of the process working include: The nation's 240 largest hospi- tals reported that, following theimplementation of the collabo-rative process, 90 percent ofpotential donors were referredto their OPO (Organ Procure-ment Organizations) by the hospital in a timely manner.The average prior to the Collab-orative was 50 percent, withsome hospitals not reportingany potential donors at all. Donation rates in hospitals that are participating in the Collab-orative are up 14 percent in thepast year (2004) compared to a7 percent increase in non-Collaborative hospitals. Since the initiative's inception, the average monthly number of standard criteria donorsthroughout the U.S. increasedfrom 370 to 430 (a standard cri-teria donor is defined as oneunder 70 years of age). The rateof 370 had remained virtuallyunchanged for the past 10 years. The longest donor-before-a- non-donor streak (a newCollaborative-driven measure-ment) currently stands at 21 arow by the Theda ClarkRegional Medical Center inNeenah, WI.As to the future, Burdick says the next challenge is to increase the\"yield and spread,\" which can beinterpreted as increasing thenumber of organs recovered fromeach deceased donor, while at thesame time increasing the numberof hospitals with the largestpotential to be involved in theexisting collaborative. TheCollaborative has set a goal ofincreasing the organsper donor procured to 3.75.Ultimately, Burdick organdonation into the larger questionof what end-of-life policies hos-pitals have in place. He says,\"The family (having an) honestchance to make an informeddecision, having all the informa-tion needed regarding the end oflife of a loved one who isextremely ill and likely to die, iswhat they deserve. (This) willautomatically give the family the information they need tomake a decision on organ donation as well.\" Pediatric Organ Allocation Revisions to OPTN/UNOS alloca-tion policies will give kids andadults an equal chance of gettingan organ transplant. In an attempt to assure that chil- dren have the same chance asadults of receiving a lifesavingkidney and liver transplants, theOPTN/UNOS Board of Directorsadopted a series of revisions to the Transplant News DigestTransplant News Digest Jim Warrenfrom the editors of Transplant News I By Jim Warren, editor and publisher Transplant News, edited and published by Jim Warren, is a twice-monthly newsletter for the transplant commu- nity focusing on developments in organ, tissue, eye and bone marrow procurement and transplantation. Transplant News Digest is written exclusively for quarterly publication in Transplant Chronicles .

The new policies restructure theway pediatric candidates are consid-ered for kidney and liver organoffers. Pediatric Liver Allocation Policy:Livers from donors younger than 18 will continue to be offered to themost urgent (Status 1) children andadult patients, first locally and thenwithin one of the 11 regions nation-wide. However, under the new poli-cies, pediatric donor livers will thenbe offered in the following order: candidates age 11 or younger within the donor's region local adolescent patients with a PELD (Model for Pediatric End-Stage Liver Disease) score of 15or higher on a 40-point scale local adult candidates with a MELD (Model for End-StageLiver Disease) score of 15 orhigher regional adolescent patients with a score of 15 or higher regional adult candidates with a score of 15 or higher remaining candidates locally and regionally, with adolescentsreceiving priority over adults. In addition, the Board also separated the criteria for the most urgent cate-gory of pediatric liver candidates(Status 1) into two subgroups toensure that the candidates who arein the utmost medical urgencyreceive first consideration for donat-ed livers. Both children and adultscan qualify as Status 1 if they are atimminent risk of death without atransplant.Revised Pediatric Kidney Alloca- tion Policy: The board also adopted a revised kidney allocation policy thatreplaces an earlier system of allow-ing children extra allocation pointsbased on their age. Kidneys fromdonors younger than age 35 will beoffered to pediatric candidatesbefore any adult patients, with thefollowing exceptions: a perfect or nearly perfectimmune system match betweendonor and candidate candidates whose immune sensi- tivity limits the number of med-ically suitable offers candidates awaiting other organs in addition to a kidney candidates who have previously been a living organ donor 2004 is the year the rules for get- ting a life-saving organ transplantchanged forever I By Jim Warren \"I need a liver. Please help savemy life. \" Those simple sentences posted on a billboard in Houston, TX, alongwith a series of newspaper ads andmedia appearances, got ToddKrampitz, a 32-year-old newlywedwith liver cancer, a liverdonated by an out-of-state donor.Despite widespread criticism of hisend run around the waiting list,Krampitz's success clearly resonatedwith many on the waiting list, andmedia campaigns began popping upall over. Just two months later, an obscure Internet company calledMatchingDonors.com successfully brokered its first kidney transplantfor a registrant who was paying $295 a month to list his name in anattempt to get a donor. Bob Hickey,58, ultimately got a kidney donatedby 32-year-old Bob Smitty, a totalstranger who said he only wanted to\"do something big.\" In the monthsthat followed, reports of patientsadvertising for donors on billboards,in newspapers and on the Internethave surfaced all over the country. Mark 2004 as the point in time when the rules of organ donationchanged forever. It began in Januarywhen Wisconsin became the firststate in the US to allow live organdonors to deduct up to $10,000from their state income tax to coverexpenses incurred by the donation,including travel, lost wages, foodand lodging. A month later, police inSouth Africa announced they hadbroken up an international organtrafficking scheme (paid for by theIsraeli government) which featureddonors from a poor community inBrazil being recruited by brokers from South Africa to provide organsfor mostly Israeli citizens. In April, a study in the journal Health Affairs reported that increased competition for scarcedonor hearts may have encouraged\"gaming\" of the waiting list by anumber of cardiologists from someof the most prestigious transplantcenters in the U.S. In response tothe ethically questionable, but per-fectly legal, sidesteps around thewaiting list, the Organ Procurementand Transplantation Network(OPTN)/United Network for OrganSharing (UNOS) Board of Directorsand the American ofTransplant Surgeons (ASTS)Council issued strongly-wordedcondemnations of the vigilanteactions. \"Organ a transaction,\" said RobertMetzger, MD, UNOS president.\"We strongly oppose public or private appeals that effectively put COMMENTARYTransplant Chronicles, Vol. 12, No. 1 9the needs of one candidate above all others and pose concerns of fairness.Transplant candidates rely on thepublic's trust in the fairness of theallocation system and support thatsystem through donation. Publicappeals may jeopardize that trust.\"The ASTS statement reads in part:\"The ASTS is strongly opposed tothe solicitation of organs (deceased)or organ donors (live) by recipientsor their agents, whether this isthrough personal or commercialWeb sites, billboards, media outletsor other forms of advertising whenthe intent of such solicitation is toredirect the donation to a specificindividual rather than according tothe fair policies of allocation(UNOS policy on organ donation)which all members on the waitinglist abide by. We believe that suchsolicitation and directed donationwill undermine the trust and fairnesson which the system of organ trans-plantation depends. Society, in par-ticular potential recipients and theirfamilies, must believe that the cur-rent organ allocation system is pro-tected from discriminatory practicesthat will disadvantage certain classesof individuals.\" It is hard to argue with UNOS' and the ASTS' ethically and morally cor-rect positions and yet I can't help butcompare it to former First LadyNancy Reagan's \"Just Say No\" cam-paign slogan in her highly effort to fight drug abuse. Allthe finger wagging pronouncementsabout preserving the fairness of theallocation system are likewisefalling on deaf ears as patients andfamilies decide playing by the rulesis stupid if it is an automatic deathsentence. The worldwide transplantcommunity is clearly at a crossroadsand must stretch the boundaries of what is acceptable to procure asmany organs as possible to meet theincreasing demand. But transplantation is a victim of its own success. Transplant surgeonshave never been better trained. Immunosuppressive drug regimens have never been more effective incontrolling rejection. Patients andfamilies with the financial means todo so are not going to accept certaindeath on a waiting list if they canafford to advertise for, or eventuallypurchase, a lifesaving organ. The options for a quick fix are few and often controversial.They include, in no particularorder of preference: Increase Donation After Cardiac Death (DCD). This has thegreatest potential to provide ahuge boost in organs. Expertsestimate the potential to besomewhere between 1,500 and2,500 new donors per year. Thesuccesses enjoyed by the Gift ofLife Program in Philadelphia,PA, and the University ofWisconsin Medical Center, and, more recently, the Midwest TransplantProgram in KansasCity, MO, clearly indi-cate establishing pro-grams in do-able and pro-ductive. Begin a national cam- paign 50states to adopt a lawlike Wisconsin's, pro-viding compensationto live donors for trav-el, lost wages, begin lobby-ing the new Secretaryof and HumanServices toestablish nationalregistry to new patient, i.e.,the live donor,receives lifelong medical follow-up. Continue to push for a trial to determine ifoffering meaningfulfinancial incentiveswill increase the number of peo- ple willing to donate. Implement presumed consent, mandated choice, first-personconsent, state registries, and anyother program that has a prayerof increasing donation. There islittle to lose and much to gain,given the fact that so many peo-ple in need of a transplant aretaking matters into their ownhands anyway. Transplantation is clearly at a cross- roads. With more than 87,000Americans, and thousands moreworldwide, on a waiting list for anorgan, and with the list growing, therules for getting a life-saving trans-plant have changed forever. ... TC Consult your tax advisor10 Transplant Chronicles, Vol. 12, No. 2THE PRIMARY PURPOSE for using a wheelchair is to increase your abili-ty to be independent within the com-munity. As society makes the envi-ronment more accessible to peoplewith handicaps, wheelchairs are mak-ing people free to work, shop andeven participate in recreationalsports. HA VING STATED THE PURPOSE, you do not want to surrender yourability to walk. There are many arti-cles that report the link betweenwalking, quality of life and mortality.Immobility is associated with manyadverse effects, such as the decreasein bone density, muscle weakness,joint contractures, constipation, skinsores, and the decrease in heart andlung function. If you use a wheel-chair frequently, you need to partici-pate in an exercise program thatincludes stretching, strengthening andweight bearing exercises, and aerobic training to avoid the adverse effectsof immobility. AS A PHYSICAL THERAPIST, I recommend the use of a wheelchairfor individuals waiting for transplan-tation and for those recovering fromsurgery in order to prevent isolationand concentrate their energy towardsrehabilitation. For people with chron-ic impairments like complicationsrelated to diabetes, a wheelchairmight allow the individual to remainan active member of their family andcommunity. Using a wheelchair can help remove the loss of self-controland social isolation, and allow anindividual to complete some of theirgoals. THE FIRST DECISION SHOULD ADDRESS whether you should havea manual or an electrically poweredchair. Benefits of a manual chairinclude the fact that you need to pro-pel the chair, therefore getting someexercise to maintain your health. Ifyou are going to use the chair on adaily basis, you should have a physi-cal therapist measure you for a prop-er fit to assure comfort and avoidproblems. If you are only going touse the chair for occasional commu-nity outings and someone will escortyou, a manual chair is a good choice.You should select a chair that is lightin weight, and can fold to be easilypushed and transported in your vehi-cle. The manual wheelchair is lessexpensive and is easier to maintainand repair. MOTORIZED WHEELCHAIRS have certainly opened up opportuni-ties for patients with long-termimpairments. These chairs are veryexpensive and typically require med-ical documentation from a physicianand physical therapist for insurancecoverage. The chair is typically cus-tomized to meet your needs. The dis-advantages of an electric wheelchairinclude the fact that they are heavy,have limited battery use, and require a vehicle that has the space andcapacity to have a mechanical liftinstalled to load and unload the chair. ELECTRIC SCOOTERS are avail- able if you do not need the special-ized features of a customized powerwheelchair. The four-wheeled scoot-ers have increased stability, whichwould be important for clients whohave problems with balance, obesity,or who will be driving their scooteron uneven ground. A three-wheeledscooter has less stability, but it has atighter turning radius, which maymake a difference when operating insmaller spaces. You must considerhow you get on and off the scooter.With some scooters you need to havethe strength, flexibility and balanceto step over the controls to sit down,while other scooters have a swivelseat or have the driving controls onthe arm rest. Many of the disadvan-tages that were discussed with pow-ered wheelchairs are the same withscooters. THERE ARE MANY ACCESSORIES that can be added to the wheelchair or scooter to make activities easier.Features can be added to carry objectsand make desktop activities easier tocomplete. Holders for oxygen tanksand mechanical ventilators can besecured to the chairs. Different joy-sticks and wheels can be selected tomake the chair easier to drive. AS YOU CAN SEE, deciding to use a wheelchair is a complex issue. Youshould spend time examining yourneeds and goals; discuss yourthoughts and feelings with your family. Work with the case managerfrom your insurance company andwith your health care team to helpyou in your decision and the selec-tion of the right equipment and tomaximize Medicare, Medicaid or pri-vate insurance coverage. TCWhen a Wheelchair is the Way to Go I By Chris L. Wells, PhD, CCS, ATC THERE ARE MANY ISSUES to examine when you are considering using a wheelchair or scooter. Financial resources, the ability to maintain and repair thechair, access to the community, family support, and theability to operate the chair safely are just a few key issues that need tobe addressed with your family and health care team. Transplant Chronicles, Vol. 12, No. 2 11Allison was born with a heart valve that was too small. You would neverknow that Allison had a heart condi-tion just by looking at her. She wasfull of life. Allison was the strongestperson we have ever met. No matterwhere she was, she showed optimisticenergy. Whenever she had to have asurgery she was very brave and shebarely ever shed a tear. Even thoughshe had so many unfair things happento her, she never once complained andwas always appreciative. On August 9, 2002, Allison went into her eighth surgery. When Allison toldus she would be having valve surgery we assumed that it would be ok, justlike every other time. We were wrong.This time it didn't go ok. After weeksof problems and complications thedoctors decided that Allison wouldneed a new heart. Allison waited for aheart for three and a half weeks, butunfortunately one never came. Allisonwould have wanted to be a donor butunfortunately her organs weren'thealthy enough. After Allison passed away, we real- ized how important life is. We startedto hang out more and we called each other often to support each other through this.Sometimes we talkedabout memories we hadwith Allison and, othertimes, we out like weusually did. We didn't haveto say, \"I'm here for you.\"We understood that wewere there for each other.If we wanted to talk tosomeone about how wefelt, we knew that one ofour friends would be therefor us. From Allison's expe- learnedthat their organs. Wewant to tell peopleour story and encour-age them to becomedonors. We enjoy providing people with information about the importanceof organ donation.

She was everything you could want in a friend. In this world today, there are so many people who judge others just because of howthey look or may seem to be, but Allison wasn't like that. She taught usthat there is more to a person than what is shown on the outside.

I reallydidn't think that much about beingpromoted to black belt. I was morefocused on getting the long overdueexercise, growing stronger and get-ting back in shape. My biggest thrillwas stepping on the scales and watch-ing my weight slowly drop from 215lbs down to 165 lbs. and going froma waist size of 40 to 36. What couldbe better than that? It didn't reallysink in that I could actually achievethe black belt level until I was aboutthree belt levels away.

The major side effectof high dose vitamin C is diarrhea andstomach upset. Finally, Echinacea is a natural product that is thought to ward off coldsthrough stimulating the immune sys-tem. Because of the potential immune-stimulant affect of Echinacea, it is not recommended for use by transplantrecipients. One final reminder...

Topics include: understand-ing Medicare coverage and other financial issues; getting thefacts about depression\u2014how to recognize and treat it; and,finally, empowering ourselves to be better advocates for ourcare. As transplant recipients, we face issues related to dailyliving plus additional challenges that come with transplanta-tion. But we are not alone\u2014we can help one another by shar-ing information and providing support. Why these topics? To prepare for this series of calls, the National KidneyFoundation asked transplant recipients what they wanted tolearn more about. We got a huge response, and these three topicsemerged as some of the most important, unique challengesrecipients are now facing. We then reached out to transplantrecipients and health care professionals who were willing toshare information and talk about their individual experiences. How will these calls work? Each topic will be scheduled on three different days and times to allow many of us to participate. Pre-registration is strongly encouraged.

CALL SCHEDULE: \"Getting the Most Out of Medicare\" May 11, Wednesday, at 8:00 pm Eastern Time May 12, Thursday, at 8:00 pm Eastern Time May 28, Saturday, at 5:00 pm Eastern Time One constant about Medicare is that it is always changing. Though Medicare is a Federal program, each recipient's bene-fits under Medicare are dependent on a recipient's unique cir-cumstances (e.g., the type, date and place of your transplant;other coordinated insurance benefits; and\u2014for the first timebecause of recent changes in Medicare\u2014income.) Understanding your rights and benefits under Medicare and how Parts A, B, C and D fit your needs may feel like alphabetsoup. We will discuss the \"nuts and bolts\" of Medicare andthen move on to talk about changes we anticipate in the nextfew years, due to the recently enacted Medicare PrescriptionDrug and Modernization Act of 2003. \"Understanding Depression\" June 12, Sunday, at 4:00 pm Eastern Time June 16, Thursday, at 9:00 pm Eastern Time June 25, Saturday, at 3:00 pm Eastern Time Before transplant, we focus on just staying alive. It is not unusual for us to be depressed as we hope to live and, at thesame time, know that we may not. After transplant, there maybe tremendous pressure on us to just be happy that we arealive, and usually we are! But the phenomenal experience oftransplantation brings a wide range of emotion, and learningto cope with a new set of challenges that come with livingwith the chronic condition of transplant is challenging. Wehave the same life problems as the general non-transplantedpopulation, along with other challenges. Join us as we talkabout depression and the complex issues that cause it. \"Helping Others While Empowering Ourselves\" July 10, Sunday, at 5:00pm Eastern Time July 21, Tuesday, at 8:00 pm Eastern Time July 30, Saturday, at 1:00 pm Eastern Time After transplantation, we are grateful and proud to be able to go on with our lives. However, many of us are so thankful toour donors, living and deceased, and to our family and friendswho were there for us.

When selecting a toothbrush you should consider... The ADA Seal of Acceptance \u2014 The ADA (American DentalAssociation) Seal of Acceptanceidentifies products that have beenproven to prevent plaque andtooth decay. Furthermore, theseproducts have been tested toensure they will not harm the consumer. Harder bristles aren't better. \u2014 For years, dentistry has endorsedusing soft bristle toothbrushesbecause hard bristle toothbrushesare too abrasive. Long term use ofhard bristles will result in irre-versible recession and tooth abra-sion. Remarkably, hard bristletoothbrushes remain on storeshelves. Bigger isn't better, either. \u2014It is important to select a toothbrushhead that fits comfortably in yourmouth. Toothbrushes with largerheads often miss plaque in hard-to-reach areas such as the molars.A smaller head toothbrush allowsthe user to maneuver it with easeand will allow the bristles to con-tact those \"hard-to-reach areas\"better. Do different shaped toothbrushes really make a difference?\u2014Diamond, tapered or bristles inevery direction are just a few examples of the latest in tooth-brush design. An example of abeneficial design is a toothbrushwhere the bristles at the tip areelongated. These bristles give thetoothbr ush an \"extended reach\" and aid in brushing hard-to-reachmolars. To determine which designis best for you, ask your dental pro-fessional. They will be able toselect a design that will help reachthe areas you tend to miss. Electric vs. Manual \u2014Though electric toothbrushes can be awonderful motivational tool andmany are now equipped with tim-ing devices, plaque can beremoved just as well with a manu-al toothbrush. Electric toothbrush-es are helpful in assisting thosewho have inadequate dexterity,i.e., the elderly, children, andthose afflicted with illnessesor medications that effect hand coordination. Preventing the Flu and Colds Immunosuppressed patients are par-ticularly susceptible to the flu andcolds, especially with the shortage offlu vaccine this year. Here are somesimple tips regarding your toothbrushstorage: Never share toothbrushes. Wash your hands before and after brushing your teeth. Replace your toothbrush every three months, when the bristlesfray or after any oral or upper respiratory infection. Frayed bris- tles are poor at removing plaqueand damage the gums. Bacteriaand viruses live and grow on yourtoothbrush. You are at risk forinfection if you do not changeyour toothbrush. (Disinfectingyour toothbrush, in bleach, hydro-gen peroxide, antiseptic mouthrinses, dishwashers, or boilingwater, is not advised for it dam-ages the bristles.) Allow toothbrushes to air dry. (Covering a wet toothbrush cre-ates a humid environment that willaccelerate the growth of bacteria.) When using a toothbrush holder for multiple toothbrushes, be surethat the toothbrush heads are sepa-rated and never touch. Toothbrushes should be stored two to five feet away from the toilet.It is also recommended to closethe lid of the toilet when flushing.Research has found that tooth-brushes are vulnerable to airbornebacteria such as E. coli, which canbe transferred from the toilet to atoothbrush nearby. Shopping for the right toothbrush can be overwhelming. Choosing a tooth-brush with the ADA seal of approval,soft bristles, the right size and theright shape are important. Your health care professional is the bestsource in finding the toothbrush thatbest fits your mouth. Electric tooth-brushes can be very beneficial andfun. Furthermore, where you storeyour toothbrush and how often youreplace it can protect you from bacter-ial and viral infections.

But I alsocouldn't run as fast or long withoutgetting tired and weak. I needed akidney transplant, so my mom bravelydonated her kidney to me. My dadhad several responsibilities, such astaking care of my mom, my brotherand myself, so my mom wasn't theonly brave one. I felt awesome after the surgery. I had a lot more energy, but taking medica-tions made me feel different from myfriends. When I was about eight, my mom, dad, brother and I went to a camp forfamilies that had experiences withtransplants. Before attending camp, I was completely convinced that I wasthe only person in the world who hada transplant. Well, I sure was wrong. I found friends that had to take med- ication too. I could talk and relate tothem about things like taking medi-cine every day; doctors; monthlyblood draws and other things I neverimagined I would have to deal with. I continue to attend the camp. I have fun, but I also meet new people whoknow what I'm going through\u2014and Iactually feel normal for once. My par-ents especially like it because theycan go and exchange stories withother parents. Through talking to peo-ple with similar stories, my familyand I have learned that going throughall of this was more of a gift than apain. My parents learn about newmedications and advancements intransplantation during educational andsupport sessions. I participate in bik-ing and rock climbing or sometimeswe just sit in a room and talk. Theonly bad thing about it is that it's onlyfor a weekend once a year. I am no longer embarrassed about my transplant. I'm actually proud of it, and I encourage people to \"give the Gift of Life\" and become organ donors. I went to camp looking to make friends. I left with not only newfriends, but with more respect for life.
