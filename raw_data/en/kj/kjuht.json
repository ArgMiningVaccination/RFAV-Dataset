MANUSCRIPT ACCEPTED ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT 3 Background & Aims: There are few data available on the real-life pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamics features of vedolizumab, a mon oclonal antibody against integrin 47. We performed a prospective study of patients wit h inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) treated with vedolizumab to determin e serum drug concentrations, formation of anti-vedolizumab antibodies (AVAs), an d integrin 47 saturation. Methods: We performed a prospective study of 106 pa tients with IBD (67 with Crohn's disease and 39 with ulcerative colitis) tre ated with vedolizumab from September 2014 through March 2017 at 2 tertiary med ical centers in Israel. Clinical data and serum samples were collected before and du ring induction and maintenance therapy. Clinical remission was defined as Harvey-B radshaw index scores below 5 or as Simple Clinical Colitis Activity Index scores of 3 or less. We measured serum levels of vedolizumab, AVAs, and markers of inflamm ation. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were obtained from some patients at designated trough timepoints and CD3+ CD45RO+ T cells were isolated from 36 samp les. Cells were incubated with fluorescent-conjugated vedolizumab and flow cy tometry was used to quantify 47 integrin saturation. We without IBD (non-IBD controls, IBD not treated with vedolizumab (untreated IBD controls, n=8) and patients with IBD treated with vedolizumab (n=15). Results: Clinical remission was achieved by 48/106 patients (45%) by week 6 and 50/106 patients (48%) by week 14 of treatment. The median level of vedolizumab at week 6 was higher in patients in clinical remission (40.2 \u00b5g/mL) than in patients with active disease (29.7 \u00b5g/mL; P=.05). The median serum level of vedolizumab was significantly higher in patients with normal level of c-reactive protein (21.8 \u00b5g/mL vedolizumab) vs the level in those with a high leve l of c-reactive protein (11.9 \u00b5g/mL vedolizumab) during maintenance treatment (P=.0006) . The other clinical outcomes measured were not associated with median serum leve l of vedolizumab at any time point examined. AVAs were detected in 17% of patien ts during induction therapy and 3% of patients during maintenance therapy, but did not correlate with clinical outcomes. Flow-cytometry analysis of peripheral blo od memory T cells (n=36) showed near-complete occupancy of 47 integrin at weeks 2 and 14 and during MANUSCRIPT ACCEPTED ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT 4 maintenance phase, regardless of response status or drug levels. Most intestinal CD3+CD45RO+ memory T cells of healthy and IBD contr ols expressed 47 (72%; inter-quartile range, 56%-81%). In contrast, free 47 was detectable on only 5.6% of intestinal memory cells (inter-quartile range, 4.4% -11.2%) (P<.0001) from vedolizumab-treated patients, regardless of respons e. Conclusion: In a prospective study of real-life pat ients with IBD, we associated vedolizumab drug levels with remission and level of a marker of inflammation. Integrin 47 was blocked in almost all T cells from patients t reated with vedolizumab, regardless of serum level of the drug or response to treatment. These findings indicate a need to explore alternative mec hanisms that prevent response to leukocyte homing to the gut via binding of MADCAM1 on intestinal endothelium 1-3. Vedolizumab is a monoclonal antibody (mAb) against 47 which is efficacious for patients with moderate to severe CD and UC 4, 5. Whereas higher levels of anti-TNFs, both inflixim ab and adalimumab, were associated with clinical remission and mucosal heal ing in UC and CD 6-9, data regarding pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of vedolizumab are still scarce. The GEMINI trials have demonstrated that vedolizuma b drug levels were positively associated with clinical response at week 6. Howeve r, drug levels have not been reported for later time-points 1011 , and it is still unknown whether therapeutic drug- monitoring (TDM) of vedolizumab could improve patie nt management. The regulatory submission of vedolizumab asserts its me chanism of action is mediated by blockade of 47 on target cells, predominantly memory T-cells, th ereby inhibiting these cells from binding to MADCAM1 and migrating i nto inflamed intestinal tissues 12 . In the GEMINI program, integrin receptor saturati on on target effector cells MANUSCRIPT ACCEPTED ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT 5 was demonstrated with high (6mg/kg) and low (2mg/kg ) dosing regimens of vedolizumab, but correlation of target occupancy wi th individual patients' response status was not shown 13 . Moreover, there are hitherto no data on 47 receptor occupancy in the gut. The present study therefore a imed to assess, in a large prospective real-life cohort, the relationship betw een vedolizumab levels, clinico- biologic end-points and 47 target occupancy in the blood and the intestine. MANUSCRIPT ACCEPTED ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT 6 Methods Patient population This was a prospective observational study of IBD p atients receiving scheduled vedolizumab therapy between September 2014 and Marc h 2017 at two tertiary medical centers in Israel: Sheba medical center and Rambam Health Care Campus. All patients who started scheduled vedolizumab ther apy during the study period were enrolled after providing an informed consent. Patie nts' clinical characteristics were recorded before drug initiation. Drug and AVA serum levels, as well as inflammatory markers, were measured in pre-infusion sera collect ed prospectively throughout induction and maintenance therapy, and clinical sco res were determined before each infusion. Baseline colonoscopy was performed by phy sician discretion and was not universally employed before vedolizumab initiation. In a subset of patients, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), obtained at des ignated trough lamina propria lymphocytes (LPLs), obtained during lower endoscopy, were also collected. The study was approved by the medical ce nters' ethics committees and all patients gave a written informed consent. Clinical Scores Clinical status was determined before each infusion prospectively by HBI (Harvey- Bradshaw index) for CD and by SCCAI (Simple Clinica l Colitis Activity Index) for UC patients 15,16 . Clinical remission was defined as HBI <5 or as SC CAI 3, respectively. Clinical response was defined as drop of 3 points of the HBI and SCCAI scores17 . Primary non-response was defined as cessation of ve dolizumab therapy by week 14, due to lack of clinical respons e as defined above 18 . Secondary loss of response was defined as clinical worsening necessitating drug-discontinuation or additional intervention during maintenance perio d 31 . Development of assay for measurement of vedolizumab concentration Integrin alfa4-beta7 (2\u00b5g/ml, to pre-plated anti-His-tag (4\u00b5g/ml, R&D, MN, USA) wells of ELISA plates (Nunc, Roskilde, Denmark). After drying, 100 \u00b5l of 1:1000 diluted serum was added and incubated f or 60 min at room temperature. Plates were then washed and goat anti- human chain HRP-labeled antibody (Serotec, Oxford, UK) was added at a conce ntration of 66 ng/ml for 40 min. MANUSCRIPT ACCEPTED ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT 7 The results were read by an ELISA reader EL-800 (Bi otek Instruments, Winooski, USA) and expressed as \u00b5g/ml. The Level of detection (LoD) of the assay was 3ng/ml and level of was 3 g/ml. For were added to vedolizuma b-negative sera, demonstrating significant correlation of signal optical density ( OD) with the concentrations added (rho=1, p<0.0001, Supplementary figure 1). Determination of anti-vedolizumab antibodies (AVA) concentration A drug-tolerant ELISA assay using an anti-human chain-conjugated detector antibody was developed. Briefly, 100 \u00b5l of 1:500 diluted serum was added to pre- plated 5\u00b5g/ml vedolizumab (Takeda Pharma, Denmark) and incubated peroxidase (HRP) lab elled goat anti-human -chain antibody (MP Biomedical, Solon, Ohio, USA) at a con centration of 33 ng/ml was added for 40 min and reacted with tetramethylbenzid ine (TMB) substrate. The results were read by an ELISA reader EL-800 (Biotek Instrum ents, Winooski, USA) and expressed as \u00b5g/ml-eq) after normalization versus graded concentrations of 9-1200ng/ml of goat anti-human F( ab )2 fragment antibody (MP Biomedicals, USA). AVA levels above 30 g/ml-eq cut-off were considered positive, as determined by three standard deviations above th e mean of 30 unexposed controls. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis of 47 occupancy on T-cells Freshly obtained PBMC and lamina propria (LP) lymph ocytes were isolated and prepared as previously described 19 . Vedolizumab was biotinylated (EZ-LinkTM NHS-PEO solid Phase biotinylation kit, tific, Cells were co- stained with CD3 T-cell marker, CD45RO as a marker of previously-activated cells (surrogate for memory cells) and with 30mcg/ml of b iotinylated-vedolizumab- strepavidine-PE or a biotinylated-IgG control antib ody. The expression of 47 (vedolizumab-positive cells) on gated PB or LP CD3+ CD45RO+ memory T-cells was determined by FACS analysis (Navios Flow cytometer, Beckman Coulter, USA) and results analyzed by Kaluza software (Beckman Coulte r, USA). To examine the drug concentration that completely block all free membra nal 47, graded concentrations of vedolizumab were added to PBMC, cultured 5 days in media alone or after polyclonal stimulation with 5mcg/ml Muromonab-CD3 ( OKT3). MANUSCRIPT ACCEPTED ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT 8 Statistical analysis Continuous variables were compared by Mann-Whitney test and Fischer's exact test was used for categorical data. Wilcoxon test was us ed to compare paired samples. A receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) analysis wa s performed for analysis of vedolizumab levels discriminatory accuracy for cate gorical variables. Correlations were analyzed by the Spearman One-way an alysis of variance (ANOVA) and Cochran's Q test were used to test the differen ces between quartiles. Multivariable analysis was performed using backward logistic regr ession. All P-values were 2- sided, and a P-value <0.05 was considered statistic ally significant. All statistics were performed with MedCalc software (version 12.2.1.0, Mariakerke, Belgium). Results Demography and clinical outcomes 124 patients started vedolizumab treatment during t he study period; 18 patients were excluded due to missing sera, non-consent, pregnanc y, or cessation of vedolizumab before the third infusion due to reasons unrelated to clinical non-response. Thus, the study cohort consisted of 106 IBD (67 CD, 39 UC) pa tients. The median follow-up for the study cohort was 30 weeks (IQR 14-54 weeks) . The patients' clinical and demographic characteristics are depicted in table 1 . Clinical remission by weeks 6 and 14 were achieved by 48/106 patients (45%) and 50/10 6 (48%), respectively. Nine patients (8.4%) experienced primary non-response to induction and 17 (18%) lost response and discontinued vedolizumab therapy durin g maintenance; 12 patients (11.3%) underwent interval shortening during induct ion (week 10) and 11 patients (11.5%) during maintenance. Fifty-four patients com pleted one year of therapy, 17 of whom (32%) were in clinical remission. Baseline factors association with pharmacokinetics Baseline albumin and CRP values significantly corre lated with weeks 2, 6 and 14 vedolizumab trough levels (supplementary table 1) a nd albumin level quartiles were associated with increased week 14 vedolizumab troug h levels (p<0.001, Figure 1). In addition, female gender, lower baseline weight and younger age were associated with higher levels at week 2. Female gender was signific antly associated with week 6 MANUSCRIPT ACCEPTED ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT 9 levels as well. On multivariate analysis, only base line albumin remained significantly correlated with both week 6 and 14 levels (suppleme ntary table 1). Association of induction period drug levels and cli nical and biomarker response Median week 6 vedolizumab levels were higher in wee k 6 clinical remission versus non-remitters patients quartile analy sis, a statistically significant difference in remission rate was noted between week 6 drug-level-quartiles 2, 3 and 2, 4 (p=0.02, 0.006, figure 2b). However, drug levels were not associated with remission status at other time-points (supplementary table 2) . Week 6 drug levels in partially- responding patients requiring interval-shortening a t week 10 (45.4\u00b5g/mL, IQR 19.6- 84.2, n=12) were similar to levels in e intervals were not shortened (33.9\u00b5g/mL, IQR 18.3-48, p=0.28). A sub-analysis in cluding only did not receive steroids during induction (n=71) simila rly showed significant association of vedolizumab levels with clinical remission only for week 6 (median 41.3\u00b5g/mL, IQR 19.8-40.5, versus 29.8\u00b5g/mL, IQR 24.6-53.4, p=0 of biomarker response, week 2 vedoli zumab levels demonstrated a significant, albeit weak, negative correlation with week 14 CRP values (rho=-0.25, p=0.02) and week 6 drug levels were weakly associat ed with week 6 CRP values (rho=-0.24, p=0.04, figure 2c). No association was detected between drug levels and CRP normalization for other time-points (supplement ary table 3), and clinical remission was not predicted by any of the other cli nical/demographic factors (supplementary table 5). A separate sub-group analy sis for PK-response correlation for CD (n=67) and UC patients (n=39) showed similar findings to those of the entire cohort (supplementary document 1). Maintenance period drug levels association with cli nical-biomarker response Analysis of 140 serial sera obtained from 60 consec utive patients during vedolizumab maintenance therapy (week 22 onward) exhibited sign ificantly higher median vedolizumab levels at time-points with respective ly, p=0.0006, figure 3). In contrast, median levels in clinical responders did not differ from levels in non- responders (15.9\u00b5g/mL, IQR 7.7-25 versus 14\u00b5g/mL, I QR 5.3-31.9, respectively, MANUSCRIPT ACCEPTED ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT 10 p=0.57). Drug levels in patients before interval-sh ortening were similar to levels in patients not requiring this intervention, matched f or the same variations in vedolizumab levels appeared similar i n responders versus those with loss-of-response (supplementary figures 3a, 3b). Fu rthermore, week 6 levels among patients who went on to have sustained response dur ing maintenance were not different than levels in those with subsequent loss -of-response (35.7\u00b5g/mL, IQR Anti-vedolizumab-antibodies (AVA) were measured in 180 sera. Of these, 120 were consecutive (week 2-6-14) samples of 41 patients du ring induction (21 with week 14 clinical remission , 20 clinically active). Additio nal 60 sera obtained from 60 consecutive patients during maintenance therapy wer e also analyzed (30 of whom were clinically active at the time of sampling). Po sitive antibodies at weeks 2 or 6 were detected in 7/41 patients (17%): 3/21 95% CI 0.3-7.7). AV A were detected with zero drug levels in one patient and with measurable drug levels (i.e. drug-positive/AVA- positive) in the other six, with the use of the des cribed drug-tolerant assay. Only 2/60 (3%) patients during maintenance therapy were found AVA positive (One AVA- positive/drug-positive in a patient in remission, o ne AVA-positive/drug-negative in a patient with loss of response). Intestinal and peripheral blood 47 integrin target occupancy in relation to drug levels and clinical outcome Peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) were prospective ly collected at weeks 0, 2 and14 in 13 patients starting vedolizumab therapy (six re sponders, seven non-responders to induction). The percentage of free (unbound) 47 on CD3+CD45RO+ memory T- cells was determined by FACS analysis. Median free 47 (positive 47 CD45RO+ cells) at week 0 was 27% (IQR 18%-31%), and sharply declined to near-complete target occupancy at week 2 (0.09%, 14 ). Near-complete target occupancy at weeks 2 and 14 was universal and unrel ated to response/non-response to MANUSCRIPT ACCEPTED ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT 11 induction or to drug levels at week 14 (Figure 4b). The percentage of positive 47 T- cells before vedolizumab initiation (day 0), did no t predict response to induction in the present cohort (n=13), nor in an additional exp loratory cohort (n=26, data not shown). Similar to the findings during induction, near-complete 47 occupancy was also found on T-cells obtained during maintenance p hase (n=23), regardless of whether patients were in clinical response (n=12) o r loss-of-response (n=11, figure 4b). Similar near-complete blockade of 47 was also found for na\u00efve T-cells (CD3+CD45RO-, data not shown). Given these results, the minimal concentration of vedolizumab able to block PB T-cells 47, in vitro, was explored (see Methods section). A near-complete blockade of 47 (<2% free 47) was apparent already with concentrations of 3 g/ml of vedolizumab in unstimulated resting cells, whereas stimulated cells had higher baseline expression of 47 and required somewhat higher vedolizumab concentrations to achieve compar able target occupancy (figure 4c). Finally, mucosal samples were obtained during colon oscopies in control healthy individuals, IBD controls (not treated with vedolizumab) and IBD patients treated with vedolizumab (n=29), and LP T-cells were isolat ed and stained as above. CD3+CD45RO+ LP-T cells in both healthy and IBD cont rol individuals were predominantly 47positive, regardless of controls' disease activity state (median 71%, IQR 55.6-81%, n=14). In contrast, in vedolizum ab-treated patients, free 47 on intestinal memory cells was (me occupancy in vedolizumab-treated patients was inflame d supplementary table 6). There was also no differenc e in the rate of free 47+ on T- cells among responders and non-responders to therap y (data not shown). MANUSCRIPT ACCEPTED ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT 12 Discussion Vedolizumab is efficacious for moderate-to-severe C D and UC 4, 20-22 . Nevertheless, scarce data exist pertaining to its pharmacokinetic s/pharmacodynamics and data on its target occupancy in the gut are completely absent. This study showed a modest association of vedolizumab drug levels with some ou tcomes of clinical and biomarker response to therapy. It further showed a nearly-ful l target 47 receptor occupancy on both peripheral blood and intestinal memory T-cells , within a wide range of drug concentrations and regardless of response to therap y or not. Similar to the GEMINI trials 23 , we also found body weight and albumin to correlat e with induction drug concentration and identified fe male gender as additional predictor - possibly due to the lower average weight of femal es. However, the only predictor retained on multi-variable analysis was albumin, wh ose correlation with drug levels was not only found for extreme albumin values, unli ke the GEMINI analysis. This may be related to differences in FcRn salvage 24 and/or in fecal loss of albumin/IgG, which may be different for the present population c ompared to the GEMINI trial population. In the GEMINI 1 & 2 studies, vedolizumab drug level quartiles at week 6 were positively associated with week 6 clinical response10 11 . In the present cohort, week 6 levels were similarly higher in week 6 responders c ompared to non-responders, regardless of concomitant steroid therapy. However, clinical outcomes at other time- points were not predicted by week 2 or 6 levels. Th is is echoed in a recently published analysis of GEMINI trial, in which no definite vedo lizumab threshold level could be determined for discriminating remitters from non-re mitters after consideration of co- variates 25 . This could suggest some detected drug-response ass ociations may arise from multiple-testing, implying further corroborati ng studies are imperative. Interestingly, a recent real-life study similarly d id not find different vedolizumab levels between responders and non-responders, altho ugh week 6 levels<19 \u00b5g/mL modestly associated with subsequent need for interv al-shortening 26 . We could not reproduce such a correlation, possibly because of d ifferent cohort characteristics or size (106 patients in the present cohort versus 47 in the previously reported one), or due to variations in assay techniques or outcome de finitions. Vedolizumab levels were associated with biomarker r esponse (CRP normalization), especially during maintenance treatment. Data on ma intenance-phase drug levels and MANUSCRIPT ACCEPTED ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT 13 outcomes are still scant, but the present observati ons are in line with recent data from another real-world cohort, presented in an abstract form 27 . Immunogenicity rates of vedolizumab were 17% during induction and 3% during maintenance, and were in agreement with reported low incidence of AVA and wi th their limited clinical impact 27, 28 . As concluded by FDA and EMA, the mechanism of actio n of vedolizumab is blockade of 47, predominantly on memory T-cells, to inhibit thei r MADCAM1- binding mediated migration into intestinal tissue 12 . Earlier work showed that even 2mg/kg vedolizumab dose provided near-complete satu ration of the integrin- receptor 29 , thereby suggesting the need to elucidate the phar macodynamics impact of fluctuations of vedolizumab exposure within the cur rent dosing scheme. Recently, higher baseline mRNA expression of integrin 7, and its decline after therapy, were correlated with response to etrolizumab, an an ti-7 integrin antibody 30 . However, the rate of 47 occupancy with this agent was not reported. The p resent findings show target membranal 47-integrin on peripheral blood memory T-cells to be nearly-fully occupied during both induction and maintenance with vedolizumab and regardless of clinical response status. Whether these results indicate blocking of 47 by vedolizumab or post-binding internalization of 47-vedolizumab complex is still unclear, but even the later implies a near-co mplete binding of 47 by vedolizumab before putative internalization. Simila r to findings in blood, near-full receptor saturation was demonstrated - for the firs t time - also on activated T-cells in the intestinal mucosa, indicating in-situ blockade of T-cells by vedolizumab and/or the effective prevention of these cells from migrat ion to the gut. Full receptor occupancy was evident throughout a wide-range of dr ug concentrations and was unrelated to response status, thereby arguing again st sub-dosed vedolizumab (being unable to block its target in full) as the cause fo r suboptimal response in non- responders. Conversely, however, these data may hin t towards other mechanisms underlying the biologic effect of vedolizumab or it s lack-of, such as receptor occupancy on other T-cell subsets 32 , which may hypothetically require higher drug concentration for optimized effect. There are several limitations to our study. Vedoliz umab levels were measured using an in-house novel validated ELISA-based assay; Thus , corroborating studies using MANUSCRIPT ACCEPTED ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT 14 other assays are pertinent. Nonetheless, the vedoli zumab concentrations herein are in agreement with those reported in the GEMINI trials, and a high accuracy for detecting exogenous vedolizumab was shown (supplementary figu re 1), thus supporting the validity of the observations. Secondly, various cli nical-biomarker end-points in relation to drug levels were assessed, but endoscop ic outcomes were not evaluated. In conclusion, in this real-life prospective pharma cokinetic cohort of vedolizumab- treated IBD patients, drug levels were associated w ith some - albeit not all - clinical outcomes of induction and with CRP normalization du ring maintenance. Peripheral blood and intestinal target 47-integrin is nearly-fully occupied by vedolizumab throughout wide-range of drug concentrations and re gardless of therapy. These pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic data suggest that w ithin current dosing schemes, drug levels in most non-responders are still suffic ient to block the 47 target molecule, indicating the need to explore additional modes-of-action of vedolizumab and to elucidate other mechanisms underlying non-re sponse to the drug.

H owever, ROC analysis demonstrated only modest discriminatory accuracy (AUC=0.66, 73% sensitivity, 70.3% specificity for drug level>37.8 \u00b5g/mL, p=0.055. 5.5 for remission with levels over 37.8 \u00b5g/mL, p<0.01, supplementary figure 2a). All o ther associations were insignificant among CD patients (supplementary tabl e 7). A separate analysis of week 2, 6 levels in relation to HBI values yielded no si gnificant association either (data not shown). Among UC patients (n=39), week 2 median vedolizumab levels were significantly higher - 55.8 \u00b5g/mL (IQR 35.4-80.8) in patients who went on to have clinical remission at week 6, compared to 29.9 \u00b5g/mL (IQR 24 -47.7) in patients without clinical remission at week 6 (p=0.02). ROC analysis demonstrated that vedolizumab week 2 levels above 32.7 \u00b5g/mL had a 90% sensitivit y and a 61.1% specificity for clinical remission at week 6 among UC patients (AUC =0.73, p=0.01, odds-ratio=8 for remission with pplementary figure 2b). Nevertheless, sub-analyses of vedolizumab levels am ong UC patients at week 6 vis-a- vis clinical remission and clinical score (SCCAI) a t weeks 6 or 14 did not yield statistically significant correlations (supplementa ry table 8).
