Adolescents wereless likely to have preventive care visitsthan were younger children. One-quarter (25%) of young children were not up to date on all recommendeddoses of five key vaccines nationally.Among the states, this gap ranged fromone of seven children (14%) inMassachusetts to more than one-third(37%) in Colorado. Many parents (38% to 77%) had not discussed one of six recommendedchildrearing topics with a healthprofessional at appropriate child ages;more than one-third (37%) had notdiscussed any of the six topics. Up to one-third (21% to 32%) of parents reported that their child's healthprofessional had not discussed how thechild communicates; more than one-third(36% to 39%) said that the healthprofessional had not discussed theimportance of reading to their child. Less than one-half of adolescents reported that they had ever discussedmost recommended health risk topics(e.g., eating, exercise, smoking, alcohol,STD, and pregnancy prevention) withtheir health professional.Lack of regular preventive care represents missed opportunity forprevention, early detection, andtreatment of health and developmentalproblems, and is associated with more ERvisits and hospitalizations. Unvaccinated children are vulnerable to infectious disease outbreaks, resulting inmissed school and work days for parentsand additional doctor visits, hospitaliza-tions, and potential deaths. Many parents (9% to 42%) had not discussed a topic and wanted more information about the topic. Unmetneeds for information represent missedopportunities to promote child andfamily well-being and to build positivepatient relationships. Lack of discussion represents missed opportunities to address parent concernsabout development, screen children fordevelopmental delays, and promote earlychildhood literacy development, which islinked to success in school. The health system misses many opportunities to promote healthybehaviors and help prevent or reducerisky behaviors in teens. Many teens saythey would like to discuss suchinformation with their health professional.32 34 363840 Summary of Charts and FindingsChildChartbook-Front-D3g.qxd 2/26/04 8:32 AM Page 5Leatherman and McCarthy, Quality of Health Care for Children and Adolescents: A Chartbook, 2004 .

Clinicians reduced antibiotic prescribing at pediatric visits for the common cold by50 percent from 1991 to 1999. Yet, theystill prescribed antibiotics at one of fivesuch visits (21%) in 1999 and more oftenprescribed broad-spectrum drugs. Among children and adolescents with persistent asthma enrolled in managedcare plans, one of three (30% to 35%)with private insurance and two of five(38% to 40%) in Medicaid did not receivea prescription for an appropriate medica-tion to control their asthma in 2002. Low-income young children with sickle cell disease were dispensed an average ofonly 148 days (41%) of an expected 365-day supply of prophylactic antibiotics.One of ten (10%) received no antibioticsduring the year. One of three children and adolescents (33%) with cystic fibrosis, a life-shorteninggenetic disease, did not receive allrecommended monitoring visits, and up toone of five (4% to 19%) did not receiveother recommended tests to help directtreatment and reduce complications.Chlamydia infection often goes undetected. Left untreated, it can lead topelvic inflammatory disease andcomplications such as chronic pain,infertility, and problems in pregnancy. Prescribing antibiotics when they are not necessary accelerates the spread ofantibiotic resistant bacteria, potentiallyendangering all patients. Using broad-spectrum antibiotics inappropriately makesthe resistance problem even worse. Underuse of recommended long-acting medication results in worse asthmacontrol, which can lead to more asthmaattacks, activity limitations, missed schooland parent work days, ER visits,hospitalizations, and potential deaths. Young children with sickle cell disease are highly susceptible to severe andpotentially life-threatening pneumococcalinfections. A randomized controlled trialdemonstrated an 84 percent reduction insuch infections when young children tookdaily penicillin. In a comparison of process and outcomes of care across cystic fibrosis specialtycenters, children who received care inaccordance with guidelines function, an important outcomeassociated with survival.42 4446 4850 EFFECTIVENESS: GETTING BETTER LIVING WITH ILLNESSChildChartbook-Front-D3g.qxd 2/26/04 8:32 AM Page 6Leatherman and McCarthy, Quality of Health Care for Children and Adolescents: A Chartbook, 2004 .

Medication mistakes were detected in six of every 100 medication orders. One ofevery five medication mistakes eithercaused patient harm or had the potentialto do so. The most frequent mistake wasan incorrect medication dose. The risk-adjusted rate of certain infections acquired by patients inpediatric intensive care units declined byup to 36 percent among hospitalsparticipating in a national surveillancesystem during 1995-2003 compared to1986-1990. Parents reported that up to one in five children and adolescents (12% to 22%)had problems getting needed care and upto one-half (36% to 48%) did not alwaysget care or appointments as quickly asthe parent wanted. Among uninsured children and adolescents, more than one of four (27%) did not have aregular source of health care, one of six(16%) delayed care because of cost, one ofeight (13%) did not get needed health carebecause of cost, and one of five (19%) didnot get needed dental care because of cost.Children and adolescents who experience potential medical mistakes detected byPatient Safety Indicators have 2 to 18times higher hospital death rates andhospital stays that are 2 to 6 times longerand 2 to 12 times more costly. The rate of potential adverse drug events was three times higher than for adults ina similar study, suggesting that childrenare at greater risk than adults frompotentially harmful medication mistakes. Hospital-acquired infections can be reduced through ongoing monitoring andappropriate infection-control measures,which can improve patient survival, avoidunnecessary treatment, and reducehealth care costs. Parents' perceptions of accessibility of care may affect care-seeking behavior,such as whether to use routine primarycare or visit the ER, and decisions relatedto selecting or changing physicians andhealth plans. Accessibility is linked tohealth outcomes. An estimated 7.3 million U.S. children and adolescents have unmet health and dentalcare needs\u2014as perceived by parents\u2014ordelayed care because of cost. Unmetneeds may have long-term effects onhealth and developmental outcomes,leading to more costly care later.52 5456 2/26/04 8:32 AM Page 7Leatherman and McCarthy, Quality of Health Care for Children and Adolescents: A Chartbook, 2004 .

Minority, low-income, publiclyinsured, and uninsured children are lesslikely to receive regular dental care. One of six mothers of live-born babies (17%) did not start prenatal care in thefirst trimester of pregnancy. Among thestates, this gap ranged from one ofeleven mothers (9%) in Rhode Island tothree of ten (31%) in New Mexico. One-quarter to one-half (26% to 47%) of CSHCN lacked adequate access to orfailed to receive well-organized, continu-ous, coordinated, comprehensive, andfamily-centered care. Most teens (94%)did not receive all recommended servicesto support their transition to adulthood. Among the states, the proportion of CSHCN who did not receivecoordinated, ongoing, comprehensive,family-centered care in a medical homeranged from two of five (39%) inMassachusetts to three of five (59%) inthe District of Columbia.An estimated 7.5 million children and adolescents have unmet need for mentalhealth care. Consequences includepreventable suicide, poor academicperformance, substance abuse, and futureunemployment. Dental caries (tooth decay)\u2014the most common childhood chronic disease\u2014islargely preventable. Left untreated, toothdecay can lead to abscesses and infections,pain, dysfunction, and low weight. Onethird of children do not have any privateor public dental insurance. Late or no prenatal care may lead to untreated maternal health problems andlack of timely advice and referrals forservices such as smoking cessation thatcan help improve birth outcomes. Improvement is needed in serving CSHCN to catch health problems early,keep health problems from worsening,limit their adverse impact, maintain andrestore normal functioning to the degreepossible, and support successfultransition to adulthood. CSHCN have more unmet health care needs and are less satisfied with theirusual source of health care than otherchildren, even though they are morelikely to have insurance and a regularcare provider.62 64 66 68 72 ACCESS AND TIMELINESS: STAYING HEALTHY ACCESS AND TIMELINESS / PATIENT AND FAMILY CENTEREDNESS: LIVING WITH ILLNESS *Data represent children who have a chronic physical, developmental, behavioral, or emotional condition and who require health and relatedservices beyond what is usual for children generally.ChildChartbook-Front-D3g.qxd 2/26/04 8:32 AM Page 8Leatherman and McCarthy, Quality of Health Care for Children and Adolescents: A Chartbook, 2004 .

More than four of ten parents(44%) reported that the healthprofessional did not always spend enoughtime with the parent and child. Parents reported problems on 18 percent to 33 percent (average 27 percent) of thequestions that they were asked withineach of seven dimensions of patient-centered quality of care. The majority (56% to 94%) of parents of young children agreed that their child'shealth professional should ask about sixtopics related to family well-being. Morethan three-quarters (77%) were askedwhether household member smokedtobacco. than half (10% to 44%)reported that health professionals haddiscussed the other five topics. Publicly insured, minority, and poor children and adolescents were morelikely to receive recommendedpreventive health care visits than thosewith private or no insurance, whitechildren, or those with family incomeabove the poverty level (respectively).The quality of parents' communication with their child's health professional mayaffect parents' receptivity to receivingadvice, how they oversee their child'scompliance with treatment regimens,perception of time spent with theclinician, and satisfaction with andoutcomes of care. Parents' overall rating of quality correlated most strongly with beingprovided information and partnership incare. Parents reported relatively moreproblems for children than adultsreported about their own hospital care ina similar survey. Parents potentially agree with a family- oriented approach to pediatric care,but it is not yet universally accepted inpractice. Parent emotional support andeconomic concerns were the topicsexhibiting the greatest divergencebetween parent endorsement andactual discussion. More comprehensive coverage for preventive care by Medicaid and StateChildren's Health Insurance Programs(SCHIP) probably accounts for higherrates of preventive care visits amongpublicly insured, minority, and poorchildren and adolescents.74 76 78 80 PATIENT AND FAMILY CENTEREDNESS: MULTI-PERSPECTIVE PATIENT AND FAMILY CENTEREDNESS: STAYING HEALTHY DISPARITIES: STAYING HEALTHYChildChartbook-Front-D3g.qxd 2/26/04 8:32 AM Page 9Leatherman and McCarthy, Quality of Health Care for Children and Adolescents: A Chartbook, 2004 .

Compared to white children, black and Latino children had similar access tocare. Yet, black and Latino children wereless likely to be regularly using an inhaledanti-inflammatory medication whenindicated for persistent asthma, eventhough they had worse asthma thanwhite children. Most children with symptoms of ADHD were recognized by their parent as havingbehavior problems. Boys were more likelythan girls and white children were morelikely than African American children tohave been professionally evaluated,diagnosed, and treated for ADHD. CSHCN with family income below the poverty level were three-and-one-halftimes more likely than those with higherfamily income to have an unmet needfor health care (32% vs. 9%) and twiceas likely to lack family centeredness(50% vs. 25%) in the care that they didreceive, according to parent report.Poverty and related factors are the \"most powerful and persistent barriers totimely immunization\" of children. Failureto ensure that vulnerable children wereimmunized was a major factorcontributing to the severe measlesoutbreak of 1989-1991. Disparity in asthma medication use persists even when children are equallyinsured. Disparity may reflectdeficiencies in prescribing and patientadherence as well as the effects ofcultural differences in communication.Rates of medication use wereunacceptably low among all children. Seeking professional evaluation is a key factor determining treatment for ADHD.Girls may be less likely than boys tomanifest behaviors that prompt parentsto seek evaluation. African Americanparents are more likely than whiteparents to face barriers to seeking helpfor their children. Economically disadvantaged CSHCN experience the greatest difficulties withcare. Inadequate insurance and otheraccess barriers such as lack oftransportation may be especiallyproblematic for low-income families 2/26/04 8:32 AM Page 10Leatherman and McCarthy, Quality of Health Care for Children and Adolescents: A Chartbook, 2004 .

Compared to those with usual care, those in Healthy Steps were more likelyto receive recommended preventive anddevelopmental services, reported morepatient-centered care, had greatercontinuity of care, and were less likely toengage in severe child discipline. Four of five Medicaid-insured Rhode Island children (80%) had ever received ablood lead test by age 19-35 months,compared to only one of five children(21%) ages 1 and 2 years enrolled intraditional Medicaid in 15 other states.Language barriers and communication problems figure prominently in disparitiesfor racial and ethnic minorities.

The change wassignificantly different from the trend atcomparison NICUs and yielded $9 insavings for every $1 invested.Nurses led teens in social problem solving and cognitive behaviormodification training to promoteadherence to intensive therapy withoutcompromising peer relationships. Eachteen attended six small group sessionswith monthly follow-up. Multidisciplinary teams from the six NICUs engaged in a collaborative processthat included training on qualityimprovement, agreeing on common goalsand metrics, reviewing performance data,developing a list of \"potentially betterpractices\" for improvement, and sitevisits to benchmark performance andstimulate learning.106 108 CAPACITY 13ChildChartbook-Front-D3g.qxd 2/26/04 8:32 AM Page 14Leatherman and McCarthy, Quality of Health Care for Children and Adolescents: A Chartbook, 2004 . The Commonwealth Fund 15Advances in public health and health care have resulted in remarkable improvement in the health of America's children overthe past century. To cite two telling examples: infant and childdeath rates have dropped dramatically (Brown et al. 2003) andadvances in treatment mean that most children diagnosed withcancer now survive (Ries et al. 2003). Yet, serious challengesremain to improve health care for America's children.* THE QUALITY OF CHILDREN'S HEALTH CARE TODAY A mixed picture emerges in comparisons to other industrial nations. U.S. children fare comparatively worse on measures of process and outcomes of care that depend on goodprimary care, such as timely immunizations (OECD 2003) andpost-neonatal mortality (Starfield and Shi 2002). Children in theU.S. benefit from earlier introduction of some high-technologycare, such as advanced cancer treatment (La Vecchia et al. 1998).Although the U.S. has more neonatal intensive care services percapita than three other highly developed English-speaking nations(Australia, Canada, and the United Kingdom), the U.S. does notachieve better comparative (birthweight-specific) neonatalmortality outcomes. Infant mortality is higher in the U.S. evenamong normal birthweight infants. Reducing the U.S. mortalityrate among these infants to that of Canada would prevent 3,000deaths annually (Thompson et al. 2002).One-quarter to three-quarters of children do not receive the health care that is scientifically proven and/or thatexperts recommend to prevent disease, reduce diseasecomplications, and achieve optimal health anddevelopment. For example: one-quarter of young children are not fully up to date on their immunizations ( Chart 1:2) , up to one- third of parents of young children are not asked about their child'sspeech and language development (Chart 1:4) , less than half of adolescents discuss health behaviors with their clinician (Chart 1:5), up to three-quarters of sexually active adolescent girls do not receive chlamydia screening (Chart 1:6) , one-third of children with persistent asthma do not get a prescription for long-actingmedications to control their asthma (Chart 1:8) , and low-income young children with sickle cell disease do not regularly receiveantibiotics to help prevent serious infections (Chart 1:9) . Up to one of five pediatric patients receives inappropriate care. For example, 21 percent of pediatric patients visiting the doctor for the common cold are prescribed antibiotics (Chart 1:7) . Several studies have found that 2 percent to 1 1 percent of pediatrichospital admissions and 4 percent to 22 percent of the days thatchildren spent in the hospital were unnecessary (Kemper 1988;Kreger and Restuccia 1989; Payne et al. 1995; Waldrop et al. 1998). Some pediatric patients experience medical mistakes and acquire infections in the hospital that can result inharm (Charts 2:1 to 2:3) . These children have longer and more costly hospital stays and higher hospital death rates. Fortunately,Introduction and Overview *For narrative simplicity, we use the term children generically in this introduction to mean both children and adolescents, unless the context indicates otherwise.This convention should not be interpreted to minimize the unique health careneeds of adolescents, which are examined in several charts.ChildChartbook-p1to30.qxd 3/22/04 10:05 AM Page 15Leatherman and McCarthy, Quality of Health Care for Children and Adolescents: A Chartbook, 2004 . The Commonwealth Fund 16 some hospitals have demonstrated improvement in patient safety over the past decade (Chart 2:3) . Health care for many children is not always accessible, timely, or patient-centered. For example, up to one of five children has problems getting needed care, one of four does notget annual dental care (Chart 3:4) , four of five in need of a mental health evaluation do not receive any mental health care (Chart 3:3), and up to one-half of children with special health care needs do not receive well-organized, continuous, coordinated,comprehensive, family-centered care (Charts 3:6 to 3:8) . Poor, minority, and/or uninsured children experience disparities in health care. For example, poor, minority, and/or uninsured children are more likely than their counterpartsto have incomplete immunizations (Klevens and Luman2001) (Chart 5:2) , inadequate dental care 3:4) , needs for care (Charts 3:2, 3:3, and 5:5) , long waits at the doctor's office or clinic (Newacheck et al. 1996), and hospitalizations thatmight be preventable through better outpatient management(Parker and Schoendorf 2000). Minority children are less likelythan white children to receive proven treatments, such asmedications to control asthma and ADHD (Charts 5:3 and 5:4) , anti-depressants and specialty care for depression (Richardson etal. 2003), and placement on the waiting list for a kidneytransplant (Furth et al. 2000). Geographic variations have been documented in the provision, quality, and availability of several health careservices for children , including: immunizations (Chart 1:2) ,neonatal intensive care resources (Goodman et al. 2002), tonsillectomy (Wennberg and Gittelsohn 1982), mental healthservices (Sturm et al. 2003), preventable hospitalizations (Parkerand Schoendorf 2000), prenatal care for pregnant women (Chart 3:5), and a \"medical home\" for children with special health care needs (Chart 3:8) . These variations appear to reflect factors unrelated to the need for services, such as differences in localpractice style and the social, market, and policy environment. Systematic efforts must be directed toward improving the quality, availability, and equity of health care servicesfor children to ensure continuing progress inimproving their health. Less attention has been devoted to measuring and reporting on quality of care for children than foradults. The quality of health care for adults is not necessarily agood proxy for the quality of health care for children, however(for examples, see narratives for Charts 2:1 to 2:3) . Since measurement is a prerequisite to improvement, this discrepancyin quality measurement puts children at a relative disadvantage toadults in improving health care quality. Children have unique health and developmental needs that can make them vulnerable to adverse effects of poor quality health care,which in turn has implications for their life course. Many healthconditions that manifest in adulthood have their origins inchildhood; likewise, health behaviors begun in childhood oftenpersist into adulthood. Hence, it makes little sense to subordinatethe quality of children's health care to that of adults, when the healthof adults depends in part on the quality of health care that theyreceived as children (Forrest et al. 1997). ChildChartbook-Front-D3g.qxd 2/26/04 8:32 AM Page 16Leatherman and McCarthy, Quality of Health Care for Children and Adolescents: A Chartbook, 2004 . The Commonwealth Fund 17Through this chartbook, we join with others in seeking to raise greater public awareness of the state of health care quality forchildren and adolescents. As a compendium of data andinterpretation, it illustrates both successes achieved to date andgaps warranting improvement. We provide practical guidance,based on scientific evidence and expert recommendations, to helppolicymakers, health care professionals, and patient advocatesconsider what actions might be taken to better meet the uniqueneeds of children and adolescents in the future. DEFINING QUALITY OF HEALTH CARE FOR CHILDREN Differences between children and adults. When conceptualizing quality of health care for children, one must notthink of children as simply \"little adults.\" Health and health careare different for children than for adults in numerous ways, withimplications for quality measurement (Jameson and Wehr 1993;Forrest et al. 1997; Gidwani et al. 2003). 1. Children have different demographics than adults, which may accentuate socioeconomic, racial, and ethnic disparities in health care. Proportionally more children than adults arepoor and of minority race and ethnicity, which puts them at adisadvantage in obtaining health care and achieving goodhealth (Starfield 1997). Minority children\u2014who represent one-quarter of all children today and are projected to comprisenearly half of all children by the year 2025\u2014may face culturaland language barriers to care (Federal Interagency Forum2003) (Chart 5:6) . 2. Children undergo rapid and continuous developmental change \u2014cognitive, emotional, social, and physical\u2014such thathealth issues and appropriate services change with age and general developmental stage. Although all children have inherentdevelopmental vulnerabilities, some children face greatervulnerability from adverse social conditions (Halfon andHochstein 1997). Many health promotion and preventive servicesare recommended for children to foster healthy development andto identify developmental vulnerabilities and risks warrantingearly intervention (Chart 1:4) . 3. Children have different disease patterns and manifestations than adults. Children typically experience many short or recurrentillnesses, but most are generally healthy. Death is a relatively rareevent, caused chiefly by injury and accidents. Whereas manyadults are affected by a relatively small number of chronicconditions, a minority of children are affected by a relatively largenumber of rare diseases that are \"usually related to birth orcongenitally acquired conditions, rather than the degenerativeconditions that affect adults\" (Halfon and Hochstein 1997). Evenwhen children experience the same diseases as adults, they do soin different ways requiring special approaches to diagnosis andtreatment (Palmer and Miller 2001). Changes in families and society are putting children\u2014and especially adolescents\u2014at risk of \"new morbidities\" such asalcohol and drug abuse, unsafe sexual practices, exposure toviolence, and growing childhood obesity, with consequences fortheir long-term health and success in life (Carnegie 1995;Haggerty 1995). Addressing these issues requires coordinated andongoing preventive effort among multiple sectors including buttranscending health care. 4. Children are dependent on their parents or other caregivers to foster a safe and healthy home environment and to obtain healthChildChartbook-Front-D3g.qxd 2/26/04 8:32 AM Page 17Leatherman and McCarthy, Quality of Health Care for Children and Adolescents: A Chartbook, 2004 . The Commonwealth Fund 18 care and adhere to treatment regimens. In many ways, the child's family can be considered the \"patient\" in child health careencounters (Szilagyi and Schor 1998). This dynamic createschallenges for including children appropriately in communicationwith health professionals and addressing parents' health problemsthat may affect children (Gidwani et al. 2003) (Chart 4:3) . Dependency decreases with age: adolescents need confidentialtime with a health professional to discuss risky health behaviorsand their prevention (Klein and Auerbach 2002) (Chart 1:5) . 5. Children often rely on different sources of coverage and systems of care than adults. Proportionally more children than working-age adults are insured by public programs such asMedicaid and State Children's Health Insurance Programs (Millsand Bhandari 2003). Nearly two-thirds of physician office visits bychildren and adolescents are with general pediatricians (Freed etal. 2004). Many also receive services through school-based andcommunity clinics, public health agencies, children's hospitals,and an array of special federal and state programs that are oftennot well coordinated (Halfon et al. 2001). Children also mayreceive care in facilities or be treated with equipment that is notideally suited or appropriate for children, potentiallycompromising the quality of their care (Palmer and Miller 2001). Typology of quality and quality measures. Different stakeholders have varying interests and needs with regard to thedefinition of quality and application of quality measurement forpurposes of accountability, improvement, and decision-making.At a fundamental level, quality can be conceived of and measuredin terms of structure, process, and outcomes (Donabedian 1980).Structural quality refers to the effect of health system attributes on the availability and provision of services. Attributessuch as organizational leadership, culture, and informationsystems are important in determining the success of efforts atquality improvement (Ferlie and Shortell 2001). Other attributes,such as the availability and types of health care providers andinsurance coverage, are the result of market forces and publicpolicy. One important example in this chartbook shows thatchildren (ages 3 and older) covered by public insurance such asMedicaid are more likely than privately insured children to receiveannual preventive health care visits, probably because of morecomprehensive coverage under Medicaid (Chart 5:1) . Process quality refers to the technical proficiency and the interpersonal facets of interactions with patients. To improvequality, physicians need to know what processes of care\u2014diagnosing, treating, and educating patients\u2014achieve betteroutcomes under given circumstances (Hammermeister et al.1995). Establishing a firm cause-and-effect link between processand outcome of care is often difficult for children's health care,however. Ethical concerns and the small number of childrenaffected by many conditions mean that randomized controlledtrials are infeasible in many cases. Hence, many services orinterventions for children must be evaluated in actual practiceusing nonexperimental study designs that are often challenging toconduct well (Kaplan et al. 2001). Outcomes refer to the results of health care on children's development, well-being, and family satisfaction. Outcomes oftenare difficult to measure for children because of the natural rangeof developmental variability, the length of time before someChildChartbook-Front-D3g.qxd 2/26/04 8:32 AM Page 18Leatherman and McCarthy, Quality of Health Care for Children and Adolescents: A Chartbook, 2004 . The Commonwealth Fund 19outcomes manifest, and, in some cases, their rare occurrence. Measuring proxy or intermediate outcomes\u2014such as lost schooldays, activity limitation, changed behaviors, and preventableadverse events\u2014is often necessary (Christakis et al. 2001b). The Institute of Medicine has formulated a widely accepted definition of health care quality that integrates these concepts: \"Quality of health care is the degree to which health services for individuals and populations increase thelikelihood of desired health outcomes and are consistentwith current professional knowledge\" (IOM 1990) . \"Consistent with current professional knowledge \" means following \"the best available scientific evidence concerning theprocesses of care that are likely to improve outcomes\" (Palmer andMiller 2001). For children, lack of strong scientific evidence for theeffectiveness of many health care services means that clinical qualitymeasures must often rely on expert opinion (Schuster et al. 1997).\"Desired health outcomes \" means that both societal values and individual preferences must be considered in the context ofchildren's dependency. The former implies a duty of protectingchildren from harm and providing life-saving treatment whenneeded. The latter implies the need for good communication,shared decision-making, and cultural sensitivity in interpersonalinteractions between the health professional and the parent andchild, as appropriate to the child's age and developmentalmaturity (Schuster and McGlynn 1999).CHALLENGES AND CONSIDERATIONS IN MEASURING QUALITY OF HEALTH CARE FOR CHILDREN The issues described above have several consequences for conducting quality measurement for children. Lack of evidence raises questions about boundaries for quality measurement. What level of evidence to require for a quality measure is a thorny issue for children's health care. Qualitymeasurement should be comprehensive to fairly reflect the currentstate of knowledge and practice. Quality measures must be basedon scientifically sound evidence and professional consensus, berelevant to intended users, and feasible to implement withavailable data. These criteria cannot always be met for measures ofchild health care quality. For example, the National Committeefor Quality Assurance recently abandoned its effort to develop ameasure of appropriate treatment for childhood ear infectionbecause the evidence was not sufficient to support it (Mangione-Smith et al. 2003). The RAND Quality Assessment Tools used expert panels to rate the validity and feasibility of outpatient quality indicators(McGlynn et al. 2000). Less than one-fifth (18%) of the finalindicators selected for children could be based on strong evidence.By comparison, two-fifths (40%) of indicators for women andnearly three-fifths (59%) for cancer and HIV care were based onrigorous evidence. The authors note that this approach \"does noteliminate the goal of basing indicators on the strongest possibleevidence, but it does suggest that it may be necessary to set moremodest expectations for the level of evidence that will beavailable\" (Schuster et al. 1997).ChildChartbook-Front-D3g.qxd 2/26/04 8:32 AM Page 19Leatherman and McCarthy, Quality of Health Care for Children and Adolescents: A Chartbook, 2004 . The Commonwealth Fund 20 Expert recommendations often leave questions of interpretation for quality measurement. Expert recommendations for health supervision (well-child visits) specifymany topics for behavioral counseling but not their relativeimportance or precise timing for discussion over a series of visits.Some topics may warrant repeated discussion with patients at eachvisit (e.g., current sexual activity for teens), whereas other topicsmight be tailored for discussion based on the needs and healthrisks of individual patients and families at particular visits (Epneret al. 1998; Downs and Uner 2002). This variability can make itdifficult to interpret rates of discussion. Additional research isneeded on the best way to measure quality of preventive servicesfor children, such as whether to adjust rates to reflect patients'reported health risks and needs. Many adolescents and parents say that they want more information from their health professional on recommendedhealth behavior and childrearing topics, and many parents saythey would be willing to pay more for it (Schuster et al. 2000;Klein and Wilson 2002) (Chart 1:3) . This kind of feedback appears to validate expert recommendations from a patient- and family-centered perspective, but it must be interpreted with caution.Schuster and colleagues note that some individuals may have an\"insatiable\" demand for information. Hence, data that may reflecta desire for more information may not reflect inadequatediscussions with a clinician. Quality measurement is influenced by policy and market issues. For this chartbook, we take a broad approach to show where quality is falling short of an ideal, whether because ofpublic policy or market constraints, insurance coverage andbenefit limits, organizational management, or clinical practice.The services available in a community and the time available for clinical encounters are to some degree a function of policy andmarket factors. Health systems and health care providers mayreasonably argue that they should be held accountable only forthe care that purchasers, consumers, and the community arewilling and able to fund. Quality of personal health care services is too narrow a focus for children. Addressing the needs of vulnerable children and those at risk of social and behavioral challengesrequires a multi-sectoral approach involving health care providersas well as community organizations including schools, socialservices and public health agencies, and voluntary organizations.Hence, quality measurement for children needs to account forexpected collaboration and coordination among various sectors.Several communities have produced community health reportcards to promote a more comprehensive view of children's healthneeds (Halfon et al. 1998). An accepted set of standardized,systems-level community quality indicators is needed toencourage broader community accountability for children's healthoutcomes (DuPlessis et al. 1998). A paucity of representative data for children makes it difficult to report comprehensively on quality. National and state-specific sources of data often do not provide dataneeded for quality measurement for the child population. Forexample, there are no nationally representative data to monitordiabetes trends and treatment among youth. Many qualitymeasures and instruments have been developed for children'shealth care, but they are not evenly available across all qualitydomains nor are they regularly used (Beal et al. 2004). ChildChartbook-Front-D3g.qxd 2/26/04 8:32 AM Page 20Leatherman and McCarthy, Quality of Health Care for Children and Adolescents: A Chartbook, 2004 . The Commonwealth Fund 21Several promising efforts are under way to improve the data, tools, and methods of quality measurement for children, such asthe Child and Adolescent Health Measurement Initiative(CAHMI), the National Initiative for Children's HealthcareQuality (NICHQ), the Pediatric Research in Office Settings(PROS), the Pediatric Prevention Network (PRN), and newnational surveys on children's health and health care being fieldedby the federal government. Better data should be possible goingforward assuming adequate funding to repeat surveys on a regularbasis and to analyze and report on the results. A condition-specific approach to quality measurement for children leaves many gaps. Quality of care often cannot be validly measured or compared between different health caresystems or providers for specific rare health conditions because ofsmall numbers. One approach is to aggregate quality scores intocomposite measures of specific aspects of care across differentclinical conditions (McGlynn et al. 2001). Another approach is touse noncategorical or generic measures of quality, such as unmethealth care needs (Charts 3:2 and 3:3) and the degree to which children receive care within a \"medical home\" (Chart 3:8) . There is growing interest in measuring child and family functioning andquality of life (see Chart 6:8 for one example) . Two recent reviews identified a number of generic quality-of-life instruments forchildren and adolescents, though only a few have been testedadequately (Eiser and Morse 2001; Schmidt et al. 2002). The useof such outcomes measures in quality evaluation for childrendeserves further research. The child's perspective is often ignored, but is important to quality measurement. Children often have a differentperspective on their health and health care than either parents or physicians, yet the child's perspective is often ignored, both inpractice and in research, which may lead to biased information(Gidwani et al. 2003). Asking parents to rate the experience of carefor adolescents is especially problematic, because adolescents mayreceive confidential care and care in school- or community-basedsettings about which parents may have limited knowledge. Healthstatus measures have been developed that include the child oradolescent's perspective (Starfield et al. 1995; Landgraf et al. 1999;Varni et al. 2001). Additional research is needed on appropriatesurvey instruments that can be used to obtain the multifacetedperspective of parents, children, and health professionalsregarding the quality of children's health care (Mangione-Smithand McGlynn 1998). A SYSTEMS APPROACH TO IMPROVING QUALITY OF HEALTH CARE FOR CHILDREN Improving performance requires systematic approaches to evaluate and incorporate evidence into practice, more effectiveeducation for patients and practitioners, and more rigorousmethods of assessment and accountability. As the Institute ofMedicine reported, \"no one clinician can retain all theinformation necessary for sound, evidence-based practice\" (IOM2001a). Effective quality improvement initiatives provide bothfeedback on performance and the tools needed by health careproviders and systems of care to \"close the gap\" between currentand desired level of performance. There is a rapidly growing literature that identifies causes of poor quality and/or barriers to improvement and thatrecommends actions that may be effective in overcoming them.ChildChartbook-Front-D3g.qxd 2/26/04 8:32 AM Page 21Leatherman and McCarthy, Quality of Health Care for Children and Adolescents: A Chartbook, 2004 . The Commonwealth Fund 22 Lack of priority for children's health care quality. A relative shortage of credible quality data or children's health may beexplained by the common method of prioritizing quality issuesbased on cost and prevalence. Given that children suffer frommany rare conditions and their expenditures per capita are lessthan for adults, issues related to child and adolescent health caremay be undervalued. An alternative approach would be toprioritize based on \"services that modify health states andbehaviors that predispose individuals to future morbidity andmortality\" (Forrest et al. 1997). Fragmentation of health care delivery and financing. The current array of health care services and programs for children hasbeen characterized as a \"non-system\" of care that is often difficultfor families to navigate (Grason and Morreale 1997; Krauss 1997; Halfon et al. 2001) include: decategorizing separate federal and state funding programs to promote greater integration of services; consolidating state programs to create a package of enhanced services that \"wrap around\" basic private and public insurancecoverage for vulnerable children; and developing new integrated care models, such as a child- specific version of the social health maintenance organization. Lack of awareness or agreement. Physicians may not follow guidelines for children's health care because few have beenrigorously evaluated to establish their validity in improvingoutcomes (Cabana and Flores 2002). Even when a guideline iswell supported by evidence (such as for asthma medications),health professionals may not practice in accordance with the guideline because they lack knowledge of or are not in agreementwith it (Cabana et al. 1999). Strategies to promote evidence-basedguidelines include: developing more salient formats and using multiple modes for communicating guidelines (Flores et al. 2000); instituting one-on-one education and performance feedback delivered by peer leaders (Davis and Taylor-Vaisey 1997); and involving physicians in the change process, e.g., teaching quality improvement skills, educating about the problem tobe solved, enlisting participation on teams (Greco andEisenberg 1993) (Charts 6:4, 6:5, and 6:9) . Insufficient time and reimbursement. Adequate time and reimbursement are necessary but not sufficient to ensure thatcomprehensive, patient-centered care will be delivered. Increasingvisit length was associated with increased preventive servicedelivery in the context of one quality improvement intervention(Klein et al. 2001) (Chart 6:4) . Given current fiscal constraints, other strategies that experts (Berry et al. 2003) have proposed toaddress these issues include: redesigning care processes, appointment scheduling, and patient flow to use time more productively; making greater use of innovations to extend professional resources such as group well-child care and telephone andelectronic communications to supplement face-to-faceencounters; and expanding roles for mid-level practitioners as members of the care team (Charts 6:2, 6:7, and 6:8) .ChildChartbook-Front-D3g.qxd 2/26/04 8:32 AM Page 22Leatherman and McCarthy, Quality of Health Care for Children and Adolescents: A Chartbook, 2004 . The Commonwealth Fund 23Insufficient professional skill or confidence. Physicians may recognize their responsibility for improved performance but lackthe necessary skill or confidence that they can apply a skill (Chenget al. 1999). Passive continuing medical education is rarelyeffective in changing outcomes (Davis et al. 1995). Strategies forimprovement may include: enhanced medical education incorporating quality improvement skills as a core competency (IOM 2003b); interactive skills training that permits \"skills rehearsal\" (Clark et al. 1998; Thomson O'Brien et al. 2001); decision support tools and computerized prompts to help clinicians apply evidence (Balas et al. 2000; Bates et al. 2003); and quality improvement-focused peer review (Ramsey et al. 1993) and other opportunities for professionals to receivecoaching and feedback. Insufficient systems and supports for improvement. Small health plans, community hospitals, clinical practices, and solopractitioners may not have the operational capacity to implementchanges in systems or practices (Dickey and Kamerow 1996; Ferriset al. 2001). Enablement strategies may include: providing technical assistance on quality improvement and information technology solutions (Chart 6:1) ; collaborating with other organizations to develop and test solutions (Kilo 1999) (Chart 6:9) ; and disseminating toolkits and templates that can be adapted for local use to improve the care process and supportorganizational assessment and change (Charts 6:2 and 6:4) . For example, the National Initiative for Children's Healthcare Quality partnered with the Pediatric Research in Office Settingsnetwork to pilot test tools for improving the evaluation andmanagement of children with asthma and ADHD. The AmericanAcademy of Pediatrics has incorporated these tools into an onlinelearning program called Education in Quality Improvement for Pediatric Practice (McInerny et al. 2003). Through lessons learned from national implementation efforts, the American MedicalAssociation's G uidelines for Adolescent Preventive Services (GAPS) have expanded into a broader, adaptable model that includes a\"train the trainers\" program and tools to help local entities planand implement improvement (Fleming et al. 2001) (Chart 6:4) . Insufficient motivation for change. Health plans and practitioners may lack incentives to adopt innovations and toimprove their performance\u2014or worse, may face perverseincentives that discourage them from doing so (Casalino et al.2003; Leatherman et al. 2003). Potential solutions include: using innovative financial and contractual mechanisms to create incentives that reward improvements in quality(Shortell et al. 2001; Dyer et al. 2002); reporting publicly on quality to create market demand and accountability for improvement (Hibbard et al. 2003); and promoting organizational cultures that encourage and reward innovation (Berwick 2003). For example, some Medicaid programs are combining public performance reporting with increased reimbursement forimproved quality of care for children (Silow-Carroll 2003). Someinsurers are paying pediatricians who complete the Education inChildChartbook-Front-D3g.qxd 2/26/04 8:32 AM Page 23Leatherman and McCarthy, Quality of Health Care for Children and Adolescents: A Chartbook, 2004 . The Commonwealth Fund 24 Quality Improvement for Pediatric Practice course described above (McInerny et al. 2003). The American Board of Pediatricshas adopted an emphasis on assessment and improvement ofquality of care as a requirement for ongoing board certification(Stockman et al. 2003). Incentives for patients may includereducing out-of-pocket costs for preventive services such asimmunizations (Briss et al. 2000). Evaluating and sustaining the gains. Quality improvement interventions must be evaluated to determine whether and whenthey are cost effective in achieving their aims for improving outcomes and patient experience. Many interventions areevaluated on a relatively short-term basis; a critical challenge is toensure that these gains are sustained over time through ongoingmonitoring and reinforcement. Some examples in the Capacity to Improve section illustrate that gains may be variable in different settings, so interventions should be evaluated across multipleinstitutions or practices whenever possible (for example, see Charts 6:1 and 6:9) . Such an approach also can help ensure that the intervention design is replicable by other organizations. Finally, several of the issues described above may be relevant to a particular quality issue. For example, gaps in clinical quality for medications to control asthma (Chart 1:8) and antibiotic prophylaxis for children with sickle cell disease (Chart 1:9)appear related to both lack of professional compliance with evidence-based guidelines and lack of parent adherence toobtaining prescription refills or administering medications to theirchildren. These gaps may reflect both potential access barriers andinsufficient partnership to educate parents and children.CONCLUSION Given society's collective aspiration to improve the well-being ofchildren, optimizing health care for children must be a nationalpriority. Efforts at quality measurement to date suggest that thehealth care system is missing many opportunities to do so.Although in some cases knowledge and tools remain limited andin need of advancement, in many other cases the nation is simplyfailing to apply what is known and to use the tools and strategiesalready available to improve care. The examples in the Capacity to Improve section demonstrate that improvement and innovation in health care delivery arepossible when health professionals, health plans, and others havethe motivation and resources to apply the tools of qualityimprovement. The challenge is to provide the means andincentives for such improvement to occur as a matter of course. Because good data often are lacking on quality of health care for children, this undertaking was a challenging exercise thatundoubtedly leaves many unanswered questions. It is our hopethat it will spur progress toward more robust research andreporting in the future. Research is urgently needed to establishthe effectiveness of many recommended services for children,identify the processes and systems that promote improvedoutcomes, and expand the data, methods, and tools for measuringquality of care for children more comprehensively. ------- We'd like to know what you think about this chartbook.

We first reviewed the general literature on children's quality of care and synthesized available frameworks for organizing andpresenting such information. We solicited feedback on ourapproach from a number of recognized experts and organizationsinvolved in pediatric health care quality. 2. We conducted a literature review using PubMed and searches of bibliographies to identify potential studies of interest, focusing onrelatively recent data published since 1998 (the ending date of aprior review conducted for the IOM Crossing the Quality Chasm report). Topics were drawn from several existing qualitymeasurement frameworks including: The RAND Q uality Assessment Tools for children and adolescents, which were rated for validity and feasibility by apediatric expert panel (McGlynn et al. 2000). The Child and Adolescent Health Measurement Initiative framework and tools, developed by the Foundation forAccountability in collaboration with other organizations. The Pediatric Excellence in Health Delivery System Framework , developed by the National Association of Children's Hospitalsand Related Institutions. The Quality Framework for State Child Health Insurance Programs , developed by the Foundation for Accountability, and the State Children's Health Insurance Program Evaluation Tool, developed by the American Academy of Pediatrics. The State of Managed Care Quality , which presents HEDIS measures developed by the National Committee for QualityAssurance (NCQA 2003a). The Institute of Medicine's report on Priority Areas for National Action (IOM 2003c). 3. From 500 studies identified, we selected a subset of 100 that we judged most relevant and feasible for presentation. Threepediatric expert reviewers prioritized this list based on the criteriadescribed above and we made other adjustments based onconsiderations of balance. 4. The final form of charts and narrative was determined in consultation with quality experts (members of the ChartbookAdvisory Board, project consultants, and other independentreviewers listed on the credits and acknowledgment pages).Methods and Organization of the ChartbookChildChartbook-Front-D3g.qxd 2/26/04 8:32 AM Page 25Leatherman and McCarthy, Quality of Health Care for Children and Adolescents: A Chartbook, 2004 . The Commonwealth Fund 26 THE CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK FOR REPORTING ON QUALITY OF HEALTH CARE In a recent, widely noted report, Crossing the Quality Chasm , the Institute of Medicine outlined six aims for improvement of thehealth care system: effectiveness, safety, timeliness, patient-centeredness, equity, and efficiency (IOM 2001a). A subsequentreport, Envisioning the National Health Care Quality Report (IOM 2001b), adapted these aims as related components or domainsconstituting one dimension of a framework for publicly reportingon health care quality. To be consistent with this framework, weadapted these aims or domains for organizing this chartbook. Wedid not find representative national data to report on all aspectsof this framework for children and adolescents. Effectiveness: \"providing services based on scientific knowledge to all who could benefit and refraining fromproviding services to those not likely to benefit(avoiding underuse and overuse).\" Given the focus on preventive and developmental services for children, most measures of effectiveness included in thischartbook report on underuse of services, which we define (inthe context of children's health care quality) as the failure toprovide a service that would have been likely to produce adesired outcome. There is relatively less data showing thatchildren overuse services, which means providing a health servicewhen its risk of harm exceeds its potential benefit. Prescribingantibiotics for the common cold is one of the best examples ofoveruse in children (Chart 1:7) .Safety: \"avoiding injuries to patients from the care that is intended to help them.\" Safety issues include wrong diagnoses, medication mistakes, surgery performed on the wrong body part, and infectionsacquired in the hospital. Ensuring safety may require redesigningand improving faulty systems and processes of care, which mayinvolve better staff training, communication, and coordination aswell as standardization of equipment and procedures. Relatively little national data are currently available to portray this domain for children. Different approaches to measuringmedical mistakes offer strengths and weaknesses. Chart 1:1depicts potential medical mistakes in hospitals based on billingrecords (administrative data), while Chart 2:2 uses a combinationof medical records and reports by clinicians to depict medicationerrors. Another approach involves reporting to state and nationaldatabases (USP 2002). The \"ideal reporting system may involvetriangulation between administrative data, chart review, andvoluntary self reports of critical incidents to maximize the abilityto identify events\" (Miller et al. 2003). Timeliness: \"reducing waits and sometimes harmful delays for both those who receive and those who give care.\" The IOM Envisioning report expands the definition of timeliness to \"obtaining needed care and minimizing unnecessary delays ingetting that care\" and distinguishes three aspects of timeliness: (1) access to routine primary and specialty care when needed;(2) timeliness in getting care for a specific problem once havingaccessed the system, including waiting time for an appointmentand time from diagnosis to treatment; and (3) timeliness for anepisode of care, including waiting time in the doctor's office andcoordination of care among multiple providers (IOM 2001b). ChildChartbook-Front-D3g.qxd 2/26/04 8:32 AM Page 26Leatherman and McCarthy, Quality of Health Care for Children and Adolescents: A Chartbook, 2004 . The Commonwealth Fund 27We refer to this domain as \"Access and Timeliness\" to emphasize the important link between these concepts. There isgrowing interest in the \"medical home\" as a concept fordescribing key aspects of quality of care for children spanning theaccess and timeliness and family-centeredness domains. We showdata to illustrate this concept for children with special health careneeds (Charts 3:6 to 3:8) , although it is important for all children. Patient-centeredness: \"providing care that is respectful of and responsive to individual patient preferences, needs,and values and ensuring that patient values guide allclinical decisions.\" The IOM Envisioning report distinguishes two aspects of patient- centeredness: 1) partnership in decision-making and 2) patientexperience with care. This domain of quality is especiallyimportant because \"what patients experience...as much as thetechnical quality of care, will determine how people use thehealth care system and how they benefit from it\" (Gerteis et al.1993). Partnership is perhaps even more important for children'shealth care given the involvement of parents in the physician-patient relationship and the need to rely on family values to guidedecision-making. Given the intermediary role that parents andother family caregivers play in health care for children, we refer tothis dimension as \"Patient and Family Centeredness\" and includeassessment of family well-being. Equity: \"providing care that does not vary in quality because of personal characteristics such as gender, ethnicity,geographic location, and socioeconomic status.\" The IOM distinguishes equity at two different levels: 1) population level: \"differences in access to health care services byvarious subpopulations,\" focusing especially on disparities between those with and without insurance; and 2) individuallevel: \"differences in treatment received based on unrelatedpersonal characteristics\" (IOM 2001b). We highlight this conceptin a section titled \"Disparities,\" but we also include data ondisparities in other sections as appropriate. Understanding the causes of disparities is important for determining changes that need to be made by the health caresystem or in wider social policies that influence health and healthcare. For example: socioeconomic factors such as income andeducation generally are stronger determinants of primary healthcare use than race or ethnicity alone (Fiscella et al. 2000), butracial and ethnic disparities remain in some studies even aftercontrolling for socioeconomic factors (Flores et al. 1999; Elster etal. 2003). Moreover, disparities in access or treatment oftenremain among those who are equally insured, indicating thatinsurance coverage and ability to pay are necessary but notsufficient conditions for equal care (Rosenbach et al. 1999). Efficiency: \"avoiding waste, in particular waste of equipment, supplies, ideas, and energy.\" The IOM Envisioning report did not include this aim in its recommended framework for the National Healthcare QualityReport, on the grounds that it is a related but separate conceptthat demands additional research. For example, some research hasfound that improving the patient-centeredness of care has reducedcosts (Tidikis and Strasen 1994). In other research, hospitals thatscored higher on patient-centeredness tended to have betteroutcomes (rates of unexpected deaths and complications) but alsohad higher costs (Bechel et al. 2000). Research is needed todetermine whether improved outcomes and patient-centered careChildChartbook-Front-D3g.qxd 2/26/04 8:32 AM Page 27Leatherman and McCarthy, Quality of Health Care for Children and Adolescents: A Chartbook, 2004 . The Commonwealth Fund 28 can be achieved at equal or lower cost for children. We acknowledge the importance of this domain but do not include itgiven limited space. We do cite information on costs, whenavailable and relevant, in our narrative discussion. Capacity to improve: achieving the aims We have adapted the IOM framework by including an additionalsection of charts intended to demonstrate the health care system'scapacity to improve in achieving the aims described above. TheIOM states that \"[w]ithout substantial changes in the ways healthcare is delivered, the problems resulting from the growingcomplexity of health care science and technology are unlikely toabate; in fact, they will increase\" (IOM 2001a). Thus, it is vital tofind examples of change that can be replicated and adapted inlocal settings. The charts in this section are intended to provide afew such examples to stimulate interest; they are by no means acomprehensive treatment of this subject. Consumer perspective on quality The IOM framework for the National Healthcare Quality Reportincorporates a second dimension, adapted from the Foundationfor Accountability's Consumer Information Framework. Thisdimension includes four perspectives representing different typesof health care needs or reasons that people seek health care,reflecting the \"life cycle of their involvement with the health caresystem\" (IOM 2001b). 1.Staying healthy refers to \"getting help to avoid illness and remain well.\" For children, this perspective must be broadened to includehelping children achieve their developmental potential. Mostnationally representative data on clinical quality for children fallinto this perspective.2.Getting better refers to \"getting help to recover from an illness or injury.\" We denote this perspective as \"Getting Better When Sickor Injured\" for clarity. The only nationally representative datawithin this perspective are for antibiotic treatment of respiratoryinfections (Chart 1:7) . 3.Living with illness or disability refers to \"getting help with managing an ongoing, chronic condition or dealing with adisability that affects function.\" There was only limited nationallyrepresentative data to depict this perspective. 4.Coping with the end of life refers to \"getting help to deal with a terminal illness.\" Although nationally representative data arelacking to illustrate this perspective, a recent Institute of Medicinereport describes many deficiencies in supportive care for childrenwith terminal illnesses (IOM 2002). Quality measures and data (theoretically) can be subclassified along these four perspectives within each of the domains ofquality described above. Some quality measures and data\u2014particularly within the \"Patient Safety\" and \"Patient and FamilyCenteredness\" domains\u2014cross multiple consumer perspectivesand therefore cannot be classified within a particular consumerperspective (these are denoted \"Multi-Perspective\" in the titles). Developmental stage Because children's needs for health care change as they develop,quality of health care for children must be measured and reportedin developmentally appropriate ways. We have distinguished andreported on developmental stages as follows: Prenatal development (for charts depicting prenatal care); Early childhood (ages birth to 5 years) including infancy and the preschool years;ChildChartbook-Front-D3g.qxd 2/26/04 8:32 AM Page 28Leatherman and McCarthy, Quality of Health Care for Children and Adolescents: A Chartbook, 2004 . The Commonwealth Fund 29 Middle childhood (ages 6- 10 years), corresponding to the elementary school years; and Adolescence (ages 1 1 - 17 years), corresponding to the middle and high school years. The American Medical Association's Guidelines for Adolescent Preventive Services (GAPS) subclassifies adolescence into early(1 1 - 14 years), middle (15- 17 years), and late (18-21 years) stages.We defined the age range for this chartbook to include childrenand adolescents younger than 18 years, so we generally do notreport on late adolescence except when it has been included in thesame data on those younger than 18 years. SCIENTIFIC ISSUES AND TERMINOLOGY Generalizability. We preferred studies using nationally representa- tive data. When no national data were available on an importantissue, we used studies of lesser scope to depict an important topic(such as medication errors) where the results are likely to begeneralizable to broad segments of the population or othersimilar practice settings, health care providers, or plans. Strength of evidence. The evidence base for children's health care is variable. We included data in the Effectiveness domain forclinical services recommended by recognized nationalorganizations, such as the American Academy of Pediatrics, whenthere was some evidence of efficacy to support the recommenda-tion (described in the chart narrative). Evidence is strongest forimmunizations (Chart 1:2) , chlamydia screening (Chart 1:6) , medications (Charts 1:7, 1:8, and 1:9) . Compliance with the recommended schedule of preventive healthcare visits (Chart 1:1) is associated with reduced hospitalizations and ER visits, suggesting improved outcomes. For anticipatoryguidance on childrearing topics (Chart 1:3) , we included all topics reported by the source so as to portray relative performance on thescope of recommended topics measured, although the evidencefor different topics is variable. For anticipatory guidance foradolescents (Chart 1:5) , we limited topics to reflect the consensus of recommendations of national organizations. Terminology. We use the personal terms \"health professional,\" \"clinician,\" and \"practitioner\" when referring to individualsincluding physicians, nurses or nurse practitioners, andphysician's assistants. We generally reserve the use of the term\"health care provider\" to encompass a broader category includingboth individual professionals and institutions such as hospitals.We report on race and ethnicity generally following the terms(e.g., black or African American) reported in the original surveyor publication. Statistical reporting. We generally discuss differences only when they are statistically significant (i.e., 95 percent confidence orgreater that differences are not due to chance), wheresignificance has been reported or can be inferred based on largesample size. We use the term \"significant\" only in this context.In other cases, we describe what we considered to bemeaningful differences. Percentages generally are rounded tothe nearest whole number, except where rounding would masksignificant or meaningful differences.

The Commonwealth F und 321: EFFECTIVENESS Why is this important? The American A cadem y of P ediatrics and the national Bright Futur esinitiativ e (sponsored b y the federal Maternal and Child Health Bureau and supported b y the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and 3 1 professional and voluntary organizations) recommend a series of regular health supervision or w ell-child visits from birth to age 2 1 (AAP 1997; Green and P alfrey 2 002). The schedule calls for nine visits from age 1 month through 2 y ears and annual visits from ages 3 to 2 1 years, skipping ages 7 and 9 y ears. The purpose of these visits is to: \"screen for disease , provide counseling about ho w to foster health y dev elopment of the child and prev ent disease and injury (anticipatory guidance), identify problems at a sufficiently early stage to interv ene to prev ent further problems , provide immunizations , answ er questions , and allow a ph ysician to become familiar with a child and his/her family\" (Schuster 2 000a). Regular prev entiv e care for children is associated with few er adverse health care ev ents, suggesting impro ved health outcomes (additional research is needed to establish these benefits moreconclusiv ely): Nationally , young children who receiv ed all recommended well-child visits had few er emergency room visits (Hakim and Ronsa ville 2 002). Medicaid-insured y oung children in three states who receiv ed all recommended w ell-child visits had few er avoidable hospitalizations (Hakim and By e 2001). Medicaid-insured children of all ages in one state who receiv ed more prev entiv e visits had few er avoidable hospitalizations (Gadomski et al. 1998).Findings: Nearly one-quarter (23%) of U.S. children and adolescents (ages 3 to 17 y ears) did not ha ve an annual w ell-child visit at recommended ages , according to parent report in 1999 (data not available for children ages birth to 2 y ears). A dolescents w ere less likely to ha ve a prev entiv e health care visit than y ounger children. Urban Institute/Child T rends ey of America' s Families , as reported b y Yu et al. (2 002). Implications: Many children and adolescents are not receiving the preventiv e care recommended b y experts to promote optimal health and w ell-being. In other studies of children y ounger than 3 years (not included in this chart), a range of 19 percent to 84 percent did not receiv e the recommended number of w ell-child visits (Freed et al. 1999; R onsa ville and Hakim 2 000). The potential for impro ved outcomes and the link betw een well-child visits and recommended preventive services such asimmunizations argue for interventions to improve preventivecare-seeking, such as parent reminders in combination withefforts to make primary care more accessible (Briss et al. 2000).For example, the San Mateo County, Calif., \"Pre-to-Three\"program has increased preventive care for low-income youngchildren through assessment, case management, home visitation,and partnerships between community agencies to promote a\"seamless network of services\" (Cuellar et al. 2003). See the narrative for Charts 1:2 and 3:1 for examples of other improvement interventions.

Vaccination is a very cost-effective disease prevention strategy. High vaccination levels protect childrenagainst periodic outbreaks of infectious disease. For example, ameasles epidemic in 1989-1991 resulted in 120 deaths, 1 1,000people hospitalized, and $100 million in medical costs (DHHS2000a). More recently, nearly 8,000 cases of pertussis (whoopingcough) were reported in 2000, resulting in 62 deaths (CDC2002a). Vaccination also protects against mild illnesses that leadto absence from school and lost workdays for parents. Findings: One-quarter (25%) of young children (ages 19 to 35 months) in the United States were not fully up to date on allrecommended doses of five key vaccines in 2002. Thiscombined coverage rate has changed little since 1999, when itwas first reported. The combined immunization rate for these five vaccines varied substantially among the states, from 63 percent in Colorado to 86percent in Massachusetts. Only 1 1 states met the national Healthy People 2010 goal of 80 percent coverage for the combined measure. However, two-thirds or more of the states and the nation as awhole met the goal of 90 percent coverage for four of the fivespecific vaccines included in this measure: 4 doses of diphtheria, tetanus toxoids, and pertussis vaccine, or diphtheria and tetanus toxoids only (82% national; staterange 66% to 94%; poliovirus vaccine (90% national; state range 84% to 97%; 33 met goal); 1 dose of measles-mumps-rubella vaccine (92% national; state range 85% to 96%; 41 states met goal); 3 doses of Haemophilus influenzae type b vaccine (93% national; state range 86% to 98%; 48 states met goal); and 3 doses of hepatitis B vaccine (90% national; state range 82% to 97%; 35 states met goal). Source: National Center for Health Statistics, National Immunization Survey, as reported by the CDC (2003b). Implications: More progress is needed to reach and sustain national immunization goals in every area of the country. The U.S. lagsmany other nations in timely vaccination of children: 63 countriesexceeded the U.S. in reported rate of coverage for three doses ofdiphtheria-tetanus-pertussis vaccine in 2002 (WHO 2003). Stepsto improvement include: public policies to ensure adequate vaccine supply and financing (several vaccines were in short supply during 2002)(IOM 2003a), improved tracking systems and participation in state and local immunization registries (Wood et al. 1999), multi-component community interventions that include education and outreach (Briss et al. 2000), and wider adoption of effective practices by health care providers, such as reminders for parents when immunizations are due,assessing the immunization status of all children, andprompts about needed vaccines during visits by children(Briss et al. 2000).

Parents often look to their child's doctor as a trusted source of information on child behavior anddevelopment. Both the American Academy of Pediatrics and thenational Bright Futures initiative recommend a variety of age- appropriate topics that physicians should address to promotechild development, effective parenting, and healthy familypractices (Schuster et al. 2000; AHRQ 2002a). Some evidence suggests that certain anticipatory guidance can have a positive impact on childrearing, such as increasing somechild safety practices and use of nonviolent discipline, promotingpositive mother-child interactions and parental understanding ofchild temperament, reducing infant crying, and improving infantsleep patterns (DiGuiseppi and Roberts 2000; Regalado andHalfon 2001). Parents in three managed care plans reported moreconfidence in parenting skills and less concern about their child'sbehavior when they had talked to their child's health professionalabout such topics (Bethell et al. 2001). Findings: Many parents (38% to 77%) of young children (ages birth to 36 months) in the U.S. reported in 1995-1996 that a healthprofessional (such as a doctor or nurse) had not discussed one ofsix age-appropriate childrearing topics with them; more than one-third (37%) had not discussed any of the topics. Many parents (9% to 42%) had not discussed one of these topics with a healthprofessional and wanted more information about the topic. Parents who had discussed more topics were more likely to reportthat they received excellent care. Source: Commonwealth Fund Survey of Parents with Young Children, as reported by Schuster et al. (2000).Implications: Health professionals do not always counsel parents on recommended childrearing topics, resulting in unmet needsfor information, missed opportunities to help improve parentingskills and child and family well-being, and potentially lowersatisfaction with care. Parents with concerns about their child's learning, development, or behavior are more likely to get neededinformation when their child's health professional asks whetherthey have any concerns (Bethell et al. 2002). Parents of youngchildren who visit the same practitioner for well-child care alsoreport more discussion of these topics (Halfon et al. 2003),suggesting that continuity of care is beneficial. More structured approaches\u2014such as the use of a questionnaire or checklist\u2014may facilitate discussion of thesetopics, although additional research is needed about the best wayto incorporate such approaches into clinical practice (Regaladoand Halfon 2002). Providing printed materials to parents, orshowing instructional videotapes in the waiting room, canreinforce discussions and facilitate parent recall and use ofinformation (Glascoe et al. 1998). System-level issues that may increase guidance for parents include assuring adequate time and reimbursement for theseservices and providing additional education and training forhealth professionals (Halfon et al. 2003).

(2000).ChildChartbook-Sec1-D3c.qxd 2/23/04 9:44 AM Page 37Why is this important? Speech and language development is typically the most useful early indicator of a child's overalldevelopment and cognitive ability (Schuster 2000b). Earlyidentification of children at risk for developmental delay orrelated problems can help the family prepare and seekintervention services to support the child from a young age whenchances are best to effect change (Schuster 2000b). A systematicreview of research found that speech and language therapy forchildren can be effective in improving expressive disorders (Law etal. 2003). Research suggests that eliciting parent concerns andreports about a child's skills is an effective way for physicians toscreen for developmental problems (Regalado and Halfon 2001). Reading aloud to young children helps children develop oral language skills and learn to read, which is important to success inschool and life (Wells 1985; Bus et al. 1995; Mendelsohn 2002).Nationally, 6 percent to 16 percent of parents of young childrenreport that they never read to their child and another 15 percentto 23 percent read only infrequently; half of low-income familieswith young children do not regularly read aloud (Young et al.1998; Halfon et al. 2002). The American Academy of Pediatricsencourages physicians to promote early literacy development(AAP 1999), which can be especially beneficial among youngchildren from disadvantaged backgrounds (High et al. 2000). Findings: Up to one-third (21% to 32%) of parents of young children (ages 4 to 35 months) reported in 2000 that their child'sdoctor or other health professional had not discussed how thechild communicates or about words and phrases that the childuses and understands. More than one-third (36% to 39%) said that the doctor or health professional had not discussed theimportance of reading to their child. Source: National Center for Health Statistics, National Survey of Early Childhood Health, as reported by Halfon et al. (2002). Implications: Although discussion of speech and language appears to be common, there is opportunity for improvement, especiallyconcerning the importance of reading to children. The HealthySteps demonstration program is one approach that has increasedprovision of developmental services to young children throughenhanced well-child care services and the addition of a childdevelopment specialist to the care team (Minkovitz et al.2001) (see Chart 6:2) . The \"Reach Out and Read\" initiative has engaged more than 1,400 physician practices nationwide in an intervention (duringwell-child visits) that encourages early literacy developmentthrough physician counseling and giving parents developmentallyand culturally appropriate picture books (Reach Out and Read2003). Evaluations in urban clinics serving low-income andmulticultural families have found this intervention effective atencouraging reading and improving child language development(High et al. 2000; Mendelsohn et al. 2001; Sharif et al. 2002;Silverstein et al. 2002).Leatherman and McCarthy, Quality of Health Care for Children and Adolescents: A Chartbook, 2004 .

Adolescence is a time of rapid change when youth experiment with and establish behaviors that canhave both immediate and life-long consequences for their health.The Carnegie Council on Adolescent Development estimated that\"nearly half of American adolescents are at high or moderate riskof seriously harming their life chances\" (Carnegie 1995). Several national organizations\u2014including the American Medical Association, American Academy of Pediatrics, AmericanAcademy of Family Physicians, U.S. Preventive Services Task Force,and the Maternal and Child Health Bureau's Bright Futuresinitiative\u2014have recommended that primary care physicians screenand/or counsel as appropriate to help adolescents prevent injuries(such as through seat belt use), reduce the risk for future heartdisease (such as through tobacco cessation, good nutrition, andadequate exercise), and prevent or reduce certain risky behaviors(such as alcohol use and unsafe sexual behaviors) (Elster 1998). Some evidence suggests that clinical counseling can help adolescents make behavioral changes, such as decreasing alcoholconsumption, increasing condom and contraceptive use, andincreasing seat belt use (Klein and Auerbach 2002; Manlove et al.2002). In other cases, recommendations may be extrapolated fromstudies showing the efficacy of counseling adults. Adolescenthealth care experts advise that counseling by health professionalsshould be part of a coordinated preventive effort involving family,schools, and the community (Santelli et al. 1999). Findings: In 1997, one-half or less of surveyed adolescents (in the fifth through the twelfth grades in the U.S.) reported everdiscussing most recommended health risk topics with their doctoror other health professional. Source: Commonwealth Fund Survey of the Health of Adolescents, as reported by Ackard and Neumark-Sztainer (2001). Implications: Although many adolescents say that they want to discuss health behaviors with a doctor or other healthprofessional (Klein and Wilson 2002), health professionals missmany opportunities to do so. Reasons for this gap may includelimited time during visits, lack of professional confidence, or skilldeficiency to address teen issues (Park et al. 2001). Adolescentswho have confidential time with their clinician and who visit teenhealth clinics are more likely to receive counseling (Blum et al.1996; Klein and Wilson 2002). Interventions that increase clinical counseling of adolescents (see Chart 6:4) include: skills-based training for health professionals (Lustig et al. 2001), use of structured risk assessments and supportive office systems (Boekeloo et al. 1999; Klein et al. 2001), and a combination of educational \"priming\" for patients and reminders for health professionals (Boekeloo et al. 2003).Leatherman and McCarthy, Quality of Health Care for Children and Adolescents: A Chartbook, 2004 .

Genital chlamydia is the most common bacterial sexually transmitted disease (STD) in the U.S., costing $3billion or more for treatment of complications. Nearly half (46%)of the infections newly reported each year occur in sexually active15- to 19-year-old girls, among whom prevalence rates may reach10 percent (CDC 2001). Although chlamydia can be cured with antibiotics, most infected people do not have symptoms and remain unaware thatthey need treatment. When untreated, up to 40 percent of womenwith chlamydia develop pelvic inflammatory disease, which canresult in chronic pelvic pain, infertility, or life-threatening tubalpregnancy (CDC 2001). Screening females at risk for chlamydia reduces the incidence of pelvic inflammatory disease and is likely to be cost-saving(USPSTF 2003). The U.S. Preventive Services Task Forcerecommends that clinicians routinely screen all sexually activefemales age 25 and younger (evidence was insufficient todetermine the effectiveness of screening men). The Centers forDisease Control and Prevention recommend annual screening forsexually active females younger than age 20\u2014who are at greatestrisk of infection (CDC 1993). Findings: Among sexually active adolescent females (ages 16 to 20 years) enrolled in managed care plans, more than seven of 10(73%) with private insurance and nearly six of 10 (59%) withMedicaid coverage did not receive a test for chlamydia infectionin the past year. There was a small increase in rates from 2000 to2002. Source: National Committee for Quality Assurance, HEDIS, as reported by the NCQA (2003a). See technical appendix for adescription of how sexually active women were defined. Although this data source is not representative of all adolescents, it is the bestavailable data on this topic. Implications: The rate of chlamydia screening remains very low in private health plans, although the higher rate in Medicaid plans isencouraging (the best-performing Medicaid plans achievedscreening rates of 60 percent). Only one-third to one-half of primary care physicians report regularly testing for chlamydia when they determine that anadolescent girl is sexually active. Factors associated with physicianadherence to screening guidelines include: a sense ofresponsibility for STD prevention, confidence in addressing teensexuality, and an understanding of the risk of infection andeffectiveness of screening (IOM 1997; Torkko et al. 2000; Cook etal. 2001). Teens say that privacy and confidentiality are importantto receiving STD screening (Blake et al. 2003). A multifaceted intervention aimed at improving clinical practice substantially increased chlamydia screening rates inpediatric clinics of one HMO (Shafer et al. 2002) (see Chart 6:5) . School-based STD screening programs also hold promise forreaching more youth (Nsuami and Cohen 2000).Leatherman and McCarthy, Quality of Health Care for Children and Adolescents: A Chartbook, 2004 .

Children use antibiotics at a higher rate than other age groups (McCaig and Hughes 1995). Widespreadoverprescribing of antibiotics contributes to the emergence ofantibiotic-resistant strains of bacteria, which are increasing inprevalence (Whitney et al. 2000), potentially endangering allpatients. Therefore, experts recommend limiting antibiotics topatients who are most likely to benefit (Dowell et al. 1998). The common cold is caused by a virus, for which antibiotics are not effective and never indicated (Rosenstein et al. 1998).When an infection is caused by bacteria, then antibiotics may beappropriate, but experts recommend the use of narrow-spectrumantibiotics whenever possible to target specific bacteria. Usingbroad-spectrum antibiotics when they are not indicated makes theresistance problem even worse by unnecessarily exposing morediverse bacteria to antibiotics (Lewis 1995; CDC 2003a). Findings: The inappropriate practice of prescribing antibiotics for children and adolescents (younger than age 15) suffering from thecommon cold (and other unspecified upper respiratory infectionslikely to be caused by a virus) decreased by 50 percent during thepast decade, from two of five such visits (41%) in 1991-1992 toone of five such visits (21%) in 1998-1999. By the end of thedecade, however, clinicians were more often prescribing broad-spectrum antibiotics at such visits (8% in 1998-1999 vs. 6% in1991-1992). Source: National Center for Health Statistics, National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey, as reported by Steinman et al. (2003).Implications: Clinicians treating children have achieved the national objective of reducing antibiotic prescribing for thecommon cold by 50 percent. Further progress is needed to ensurethat antibiotics are used appropriately so that they remaineffective when truly needed. Parents often hold misconceptions about the proper use of antibiotics (Lee et al. 2003). Physicians may prescribe antibioticsfor viral infections to meet perceived parental expectations ordemands for antibiotics (Bauchner et al. 1999; Mangione-Smith etal. 1999; Stivers 2002), or based on a belief that antibiotics willprevent bacterial complications from developing (Pichichero2002). These are not valid or effective reasons for usingantibiotics, however (Rosenstein et al. 1998). Research has found that parent satisfaction with the physician visit depends on meeting their expectations for goodcommunication rather than on whether antibiotics wereprescribed; this suggests that parent satisfaction can be main-tained if physicians take time to explain the decision not toprescribe an antibiotic (Hamm et al. 1996; Mangione-Smith et al.1999). Interventions that combine education for parents andphysicians can decrease unnecessary antibiotic use amongchildren (Finkelstein et al. 2001; Perz et al. 2002) (see Chart 6:6).Leatherman and McCarthy, Quality of Health Care for Children and Adolescents: A Chartbook, 2004 .

Asthma\u2014the most common childhood chronic health problem (after dental caries)\u2014has increased inprevalence since 1980. Four million children suffered an asthmaattack in 2000, resulting in 728,000 emergency room visits,214,000 hospitalizations, and 223 deaths (CDC 2003c). One-quarter of children with asthma have symptoms severe enough tolimit their activities (CDC 2002b) and 14 million school days aremissed each year because of asthma (ALA 2003). Medical andsocietal costs of childhood asthma were estimated at $3.2 billionin 1994 dollars (Weiss et al. 2000). The National Asthma Education and Prevention Program has issued evidence-based guidelines for effective asthmamanagement including patient education and monitoring, controlof environmental factors, and appropriate drug therapy (NAEPP1997; 2002). Children with asthma often overuse short-actingbronchodilators to relieve their symptoms, which can lead to pooroutcomes (Lozano et al. 2003). Children with persistent asthmawho use recommended long-acting medication (such as aninhaled corticosteroid) to control the inflammation that causesasthma achieve better outcomes, including fewer symptoms,emergency room visits, and hospitalizations (Calpin et al. 1997;Adams et al. 2001). Findings: Among children and adolescents (ages 5 to 17 years) with persistent asthma enrolled in managed care plans, about one ofthree (30% to 35%) covered by private insurance and two of five(38% to 40%) covered by Medicaid did not receive a prescriptionfor an appropriate medication to control their asthma in 2002.Performance improved from 2000 to 2002 for both private andMedicaid plans. Source: National Committee for Quality Assurance, HEDIS, as reported by the NCQA (2003a). Implications: National data show a substantial increase in the prescribing of medications to control asthma over the past decade(Stafford et al. 2003). Still, parents reported in 2000 that only twoof five children (42%) who had an asthma attack in the past yearused the recommended first-line medication (inhaledcorticosteroid) to control their asthma (Krauss 2003). Furtherimprovement is needed. Although most pediatricians are aware of the medication guideline, some do not agree with it and therefore do not alwaysprescribe medication as guidelines recommend (Cabana et al.2001). Likewise, some parents and children report concerns ormisunderstanding about these medications, resulting in failure tofollow prescriptions about half the time (Bender et al. 1997;Leickly et al. 1998; Farber et al. 2003). Improvement in asthma management will require a \"planned asthma care approach\" (IOM 2003c) that creates strongerprofessional partnerships with families to address concerns andsupport medication adherence (Bender 2002) (see Chart 6:7) . An interactive professional training program improved physician communication with parents, prescribing ofmedications, and parent knowledge and satisfaction whilelowering resource use (Clark et al. 1998). Asthma self-management education programs improve outcomes for children including fewer absences fromschool, activity restrictions, and emergency room visits(Wolf et al. 2003).Leatherman and McCarthy, Quality of Health Care for Children and Adolescents: A Chartbook, 2004 .

Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a genetic disorder that affects 2,000 infants born in the U.S. each year,predominantly African Americans (CORN 2002). Children withsickle cell disease require expert, comprehensive care in a medicalhome (a multidisciplinary team or a knowledgeable primary carephysician who coordinates care with specialists) to prevent andtreat complications (AAP 2002b). Chief among these is a highsusceptibility to severe bacterial infection that can lead tomeningitis, pneumonia, septicemia (the spread of pathogens andtheir toxins in the blood), and death. Based on strong evidence from a randomized controlled trial (Gaston et al. 1986), experts recommend that children with twotypes of sickle cell disease (sickle cell anemia and S-\u00df\u00bathalessemia) receive prophylactic antibiotics (twice-dailypenicillin or the equivalent) to prevent pneumococcal infectioncontinuously from age 2 months until age 5 years, withpneumococcal vaccinations as a first line of defense and prompttreatment of suspected infections when they do occur (AAP 2000;NHLBI 2002). Findings: During 1995-1999, children younger than 4 years with sickle cell disease who were continuously enrolled in Medicaidfor one year in two states were dispensed an average of only 148days (41%) of an expected 365-day supply of antibiotics of atype that could have prevented pneumococcal infection.(Antibiotics may have been prescribed for therapeutic reasonsas well as prophylaxis.) The amount of antibiotics dispensedvaried greatly among children: 10 percent received no antibiotics and 22 percent received more than 270 days ofmedication. Children had an average of 13 outpatient visitsduring the year, suggesting that there were many missedopportunities to provide antibiotic prescriptions. Source: Medicaid administrative claims and encounter data, as reported by Sox et al. (2003). Implications: Even under generous assumptions, low-income young children with sickle cell disease went without antibiotics toprevent potentially life-threatening infections on three of five daysduring the year. Other research suggests that parents of childrenwith sickle cell disease often fail to obtain antibiotic prescriptionrefills on a timely basis (often due to transportation barriers) andfrequently forget to administer these medications when they dohave them (Elliott et al. 2001). Interventions are needed to increase the prescribing of prophylactic antibiotics and encourage better adherence toprescriptions among these children. Some researchersrecommend that clinicians monitor prescription adherence andreview parental beliefs and barriers to achieving strict compliance(Elliott et al. 2001). Others have reported success with anintensive parent education program (Day et al. 1992). Survivalhas greatly improved for children with sickle cell disease in recentyears (Davis et al. 1997) but could likely improve further withbetter care and medication compliance.Leatherman and McCarthy, Quality of Health Care for Children and Adolescents: A Chartbook, 2004 .

Cystic fibrosis is diagnosedin about 1,000 Americans each year, most frequently among whitechildren. Through aggressive treatment, the average life-expectancyfor people with cystic fibrosis has increased to more than 30 yearstoday from less than five years in the 1950s (CFF 2003a). The Cystic Fibrosis Foundation (CFF 1997) recommends that people with cystic fibrosis should receive: regular health care visits (at least four per year) to anticipate and treat physical and psychosocial problems, lung function measurements (spirometry) every three to six months to anticipate and treat complications and establishpatterns of response to treatment, at least one respiratory tract culture annually to detect and treat respiratory pathogens, an annual chest X-ray to detect deterioration in lung structure (especially important for young children in whom lungfunction cannot yet be measured), an annual nutritional assessment to anticipate and treat nutritional deficits, and other annual routine laboratory tests for disease complications, such as cystic fibrosis-related diabetes. In a comparison of process and outcomes of care across cystic fibrosis specialty centers, children who received care in accordancewith CFF guidelines had better lung function, an importantoutcome associated with survival (Johnson et al. 2003).Findings: Among children and adolescents (ages birth to 17 years) with cystic fibrosis, one of three (33%) did not receive therecommended four monitoring visits and one of 20 (4%) did notreceive at least one respiratory tract culture during 2002. One of sixof those ages 6 to 17 years (16%) did not receive at least two lungfunction measurements. One of five of those ages 14 to 17 years(19%) did not receive a blood glucose test for glucose intolerance orcystic fibrosis-related diabetes. Source: Cystic Fibrosis Foundation Patient Registry Annual Data Report (CFF 2003b). (Data were not available on chest X-rayor nutritional assessment.) Implications: Improvement is needed to ensure that all children and adolescents with cystic fibrosis receive recommendedmonitoring and evaluation that is associated with betteroutcomes. The Cystic Fibrosis Foundation is working with itsnetwork of care centers to identify and share best practices forimproving processes and outcomes of care, such as earlieridentification and management of cystic fibrosis-related diabetes(Marshall 2003). As part of this effort, the National Initiative forChildren Healthcare Quality is working with several cystic fibrosiscenters on a learning collaborative to improve the quality of carefor children with cystic fibrosis.

Medical mistakes\u2014which represent \"the failure of a planned action to be completed as intended or the useof a wrong plan to achieve an aim\" (Reason 1990)\u2014are bydefinition preventable. They account for thousands of adverseevents and deaths among hospital patients, including children,each year (IOM 1999). A national public opinion poll found thatnearly one-half the public is very concerned about a medicalmistake that could injure them or a family member during ahospital stay (KFF 2003). The Institute of Medicine's landmark 1999 report on medical errors has prompted national efforts to measure and diminishthese threats to patient safety. As one response, the federalgovernment created Patient Safety Indicators (PSIs), which usehospital billing records to \"screen for problems that patientsexperience as a result of exposure to the healthcare system, andthat are likely amenable to prevention by changes at the system orprovider level\" (AHRQ 2003a). Findings: Patient Safety Indicators identified potentially preventable adverse events (potential medical mistakes) among newborns,children, and adolescents (ages birth to 17 years) during hospitalstays nationally in 2000. They include a wide array of problemsrelated to medical, surgical, and nursing interventions. PSI ratesranged from a low of 0.003 per 1,000 patients at risk fortransfusion reactions to a high of 7.67 per 1,000 patients at riskfor decubitus ulcers (bed sores). Compared to adults (data not shown), children experienced lower or similar rates of complications for about half theindicators. Children had higher rates of complications of anesthesia and postoperative physiologic and metabolicderangement compared to nonelderly adults (ages 18-64).Children had higher rates of accidental puncture or lacerationduring procedures, postoperative respiratory failure, anddecubitus ulcers compared to younger adults (ages 18-44) only.Children's rates exceeded those of elderly adults (ages 65 andover) only for infections due to intravenous lines and catheters. Source: Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project, Nationwide InpatientSample, as reported by AHRQ (2003b). Implications: Children and adolescents who experience potential medical mistakes identified by PSIs have 2- to 6-fold longerhospital stays, 2- to 18-fold higher rates of death, and 2- to 20-foldhigher hospital costs compared to those who do not have suchcomplications (Miller et al. 2003). Data limitations mean that PSIs cannot offer definitive results, but they are relatively inexpensive to implement. Thus, they offera good starting point to identify potential failures in processes andsystems of care that hospitals should evaluate for qualityimprovement (Miller et al. 2003). Tools such as Pathways to Medication Safety (HRET 2003) can help hospitals plan appropriate changes\u2014such as better organization, workenvironment, training, procedures, teamwork, andcommunication\u2014to improve patient safety in the hospital.Leatherman and McCarthy, Quality of Health Care for Children and Adolescents: A Chartbook, 2004 .

Mistakes often occur in prescribing, preparing, and administering medication for hospitalized patientsand these mistakes sometimes cause patient injury (IOM 1999).Special procedures required for children, such as calculatingmedication doses based on the child's weight, may createadditional chance for error (Fortescue et al. 2003). This chart presents data on medication mistakes among pediatric patients at two Boston teaching hospitals, detectedduring six weeks in 1999 (Kaushal et al. 2001). These data represent one of the most in-depth analyses among the few studies on this topic todate, although it may not be representative of all hospitals. Findings: Medication mistakes were detected in six of every 100 medication orders for pediatric patients, occurring at a rate of 55per 100 pediatric admissions or 157 per 1,000 patient-days. Aboutone of every five medication mistakes either caused patient harmor had the potential to do so. Preventable Adverse Drug Events: One of every 100 medication mistakes resulted in patient injury. The rate of these events (0.05per 100 medication orders) was the same as for adults in a similarstudy. Potential Adverse Drug Events: Another 19 of every 100 medication mistakes had the potential to cause patient harm. Twoof five (41%) of these mistakes were not caught before reachingthe patient. Moreover, they occurred at the highest rate among\"the youngest, most vulnerable\" children in the neonatal intensivecare unit. The rate of potential adverse drug events (1.1 per 100medication orders) was three times higher than reported foradults in a similar study.Stage of medication process: Nearly three-quarters (74%) of the pediatric medication mistakes occurred when physiciansprescribed medication (data not shown). Types of mistakes: Common mistakes were using an incorrect medication dose, giving medication via the wrong route ofadministration, failing to have full or accurate documentation,missing a date or using a wrong date, and giving medication at thewrong frequency. Source: medical records, medication orders, medication administration records, and clinician self-reports (Kaushal et al. 2001). Implications: The potential for harm from pediatric medication mistakes indicates an urgent need for efforts to examine and\"error-proof\" the medication process for hospitalized children.Attention also must be given to measuring and preventingmistakes that occur in primary care and other outpatient settings. Researchers judged that most of the preventable and potential adverse drug events in these hospitals could have been averted byone of three interventions: (1) using a computerized physicianorder entry system with clinical decision support (such systemsmust be tailored to include weight-based dosing for children), (2)assigning full-time clinical pharmacists to support the medicationprocess on patient wards, or (3) improving communicationamong physicians, nurses, and pharmacists (Fortescue et al.2003). Simple tools also may be useful in reducing errors, such aschecklists and precalculated dosing guidelines (Goldman andKaushal 2002; USP 2002).Leatherman and McCarthy, Quality of Health Care for Children and Adolescents: A Chartbook, 2004 .

Hospital-acquired affect an estimated two million Americans\u2014including 500,000 intensivecare patients\u2014each year (DHHS 2000b). Such infections resultin longer hospital stays (10 days per patient on average),increased costs ($39,000 per case on average), and higher in-hospital death rates (4 percentage points higher on average)(Zhan and Miller 2003). Patients in intensive care units (ICUs) are at increased risk of acquiring infections because of frequent use of invasive medicaltechnologies and procedures, which save lives but also carry aninherent risk for infection. A recent survey of 31 children'shospitals found that an average of 12 percent of patients beingcared for in pediatric ICUs had hospital-acquired infections on agiven day (Grohskopf et al. 2002). Findings: Risk-adjusted rates of infection acquired by patients in pediatric intensive care units declined for two types of device-associated infection monitored by hospitals participating in avoluntary national surveillance system during 1995-2003compared to 1986-1990. The rate of bloodstream infections associated with use of central intravenous lines decreased by 36 percent (from 1 1.4infections per 1,000 device-days of use during 1986-1990 to7.3 during 1995-2003). The rate of urinary tract infections associated with use of urinary catheters decreased by 19 percent (from 5.8 infectionsper 1,000 device-days of use during 1986-1990 to 4.7 during1995-2003). There was little change in the rate of hospital-acquired pneumonia associated with use of ventilators (4.7 infectionsper 1,000 device-days of use during 1986-1990 vs. 4.9 during1995-2001). Compared to general medical and surgical ICUs,pediatric ICUs had a higher rate of bloodstream infections andlower rates of urinary tract infections and pneumonias (datanot shown). Source: National Center for Infectious Diseases, National Nosocomial Infections Surveillance System, as reported by NCHS(2001) and NCID (2001; 2003). Data may not be representative ofall U.S. hospitals. Implications: Hospital-acquired infections can be substantially reduced through ongoing monitoring and appropriate infectioncontrol measures (Rowin et al. 2003). Proper hand hygiene isperhaps the most important measure but is often not observed(Elward and McGann 2002). Differences between children andadults in factors such as immune system maturity, site and typesof infections, process of care, and patient interactions mean that achild-specific approach often is necessary (Harris 1997). Collaborative quality improvement initiatives such as the Pediatric Prevention Network, sponsored by the NationalAssociation of Children's Hospitals and Related Institutions(NACHRI) with support from the CDC, are studying pediatrichospital-acquired infections so as to identify and validateinterventions to reduce their occurrence (Levine 2001).

Parents and other caregivers\u2014especially mothers\u2014typically act as intermediaries in health care forchildren, at least until the adolescent years. Parents' perceptions ofthe accessibility and interpersonal quality of care may affect theircare-seeking behavior, such as whether to use routine primary careor visit the emergency room (Forrest and Starfield 1998;Doobinin et al. 2003), and decisions related to selecting orchanging physicians and health plans (Kasteler et al. 1976;Hickson et al. 1988; Guadagnoli et al. 2000). Greater accessibilityof primary care is associated with better health outcomes(Starfield 1985; Shi et al. 2002). Findings: According to parents of U.S. children and adolescents (ages birth to 17 years) surveyed in 2000: One of eight (12%) children who had a doctor or clinic visit in the past year had problems receiving care that the doctor or parent thought was necessary. One of five (22%) children had problems getting a referral to a specialist in the past year when the doctor or parent thoughtthe child needed to see a specialist. One of three (36%) children who needed care right away for an illness or injury in the past year did not always get that care as soon as the parent wanted. One of two (48%) children who had an appointment for routine care in the past year did not always receive an appointment as soon as the parent wanted. Children and adolescents without insurance or covered only by public insurance (such as Medicaid or State Children's HealthInsurance Programs) were more likely than those with any privateinsurance to have a parent report gaps in access to and timeliness of care (data not shown). Source: Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (AHRQ 2002b). Implications: Improvements are needed to better meet parent expectations for timely and convenient access to care for childrenand adolescents. Poorer ratings by parents of children withoutinsurance or with public coverage may reflect numerous barrierssuch as concern about out-of-pocket costs, lack of geographicallyaccessible providers, and language differences (see Chart 5:6) . Extending health insurance to the uninsured is the most important step to improving equitable access to health care(Hargraves and Hadley 2003). The President's AdvisoryCommission on Consumer Protection and Quality in Health Care(1997) recommended that children with chronic conditions whoneed frequent specialty care should be allowed direct access tospecialists. Other interventions that experts (Berry et al. 2003)have proposed to improve accessibility and timeliness of careinclude: making appointment scheduling systems more flexible, increasing the use of mid-level practitioners such as physician assistants and nurse practitioners, offering group appointments with team care, scheduling telephone consultations or using electronic communications (with appropriate reimbursement) tosupplement face-to-face care, and extending after-hours (evening and weekend) care.Leatherman and McCarthy, Quality of Health Care for Children and Adolescents: A Chartbook, 2004 .

Twelve percent of U.S. children and adolescents\u20148.5 million\u2014did not have any public or privatehealth insurance during the year in 2002 (Mills and Bhandari2003). Twenty-two percent of U.S. children and adolescents livein poverty or near poverty (up to 125 percent of poverty)(Proctor and Dalaker 2003). Although Medicaid expansions andthe State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP) havecovered millions more children and adolescents in recent years,one of five who live in poverty or near poverty remainuninsured. Three-quarters of uninsured children are eligible forMedicaid or SCHIP but remain unenrolled because of lack ofparental knowledge or interest or burdensome enrollmentprocedures (Holahan et al. 2003). The most important benefit of insurance is to facilitate having a regular source of care (Starfield 2000). Children without a usualsource of care are more likely to have unmet needs for care(Newacheck et al. 2000a), more hospitalizations, and higher costsof care, and they are less likely to keep doctor appointments andreceive preventive care (Starfield 1998). The extent to whichchildren's regular source of care is oriented toward primary caregreatly determines the benefit that children derive from that care(Starfield 2000). Findings: In 2000, U.S. children and adolescents (ages birth to 17 years) without insurance were much more likely than those withinsurance to lack a regular source for care and to have unmetneeds for health and dental care, as perceived by parents. Amongthe uninsured, more than one of four (27%) did not have aregular source of health care, one of six (16%) delayed care because of cost, one of eight (13%) did not get needed health carebecause of cost, and one of five (19%) did not get needed dentalcare because of cost. Source: National Center for Health Statistics, National Health Interview Survey, as reported by Blackwell et al. (2003). Implications: An estimated 7.3 million U.S. children and adoles- cents have unmet health and dental care needs, as perceived byparents, or delayed care because of cost (Simpson et al. 1997).Unmet needs may have long-term effects on health anddevelopmental outcomes (IOM 1998; Hadley 2003). More effort and funding is needed to expand health insurance coverage for children and adolescents (Lewit et al. 2003), enrollthose who are already eligible for Medicaid and SCHIP (such asthrough outreach and simplified enrollment and renewalprocedures)(Ross and Hill 2003), and strengthen safety netproviders such as community and migrant health centers that canhelp reduce disparities in access for those in underserved areas(Politzer et al. 2001). Formerly uninsured children who gain coverage are more likely to have a usual source of care, fewer unmet needs for care,increased use of preventive care, and improved health status (Laveet al. 1998; Holl et al. 2000; Slifkin et al. 2002).Leatherman and McCarthy, Quality of Health Care for Children and Adolescents: A Chartbook, 2004 .

One of five children and adolescents experience mental health problems severe enough to need mentalhealth evaluation in a given year (Kataoka et al. 2002) and one in10 suffer a mental illness that causes some level of impairment(DHHS 1999). Medication and psychosocial therapies areefficacious for treating many mental health disorders in childrenand adolescents such as attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder,depression, and disruptive disorders. Identifying children at risk ofdeveloping psychosocial problems arising from factors such asparental depression, maltreatment, or other family dysfunction isimportant, because early intervention may prevent lifelongproblems (DHHS 1999). Findings: Among children and adolescents (ages 6 to 17 years) with mental health problems severe enough to indicate a clinicalneed for mental health evaluation, four of five (79%) did notreceive a mental health evaluation or treatment in the past year,according to parent report in 1997. Children and adolescents ofHispanic ethnicity were more likely than white children andadolescents to have an unmet need for mental health care;children and adolescents covered by public insurance (such asMedicaid) were less likely to have an unmet need than thosewithout health insurance. Source: Urban Institute/Child Trends, 1997 National Survey of America's Families, as reported by Kataoka et al. (2002). Implications: This data suggests that about 7.5 million U.S. children and adolescents have an unmet need for mental health services(Kataoka et al. 2002). Other research has found that the rate ofmental health care services provided to children varies amongstates but not in proportion to need (Sturm et al. 2003). Social consequences of this unmet need include lost opportunities toprevent suicide, poor academic performance, substance abuse, andfuture unemployment (DHHS 1999). In a survey of pediatricians regarding depression in children, most agreed that it is their responsibility to recognize depression,but nearly half reported a lack of confidence in their ability to doso (Olson et al. 2001). Assessment tools are recommended to helpprimary care clinicians screen for mental health disorders inadults, but their effectiveness has not yet been established forchildren (USPSTF 2002) and they remain infrequently used atpediatric visits (Gardner et al. 2003). Potential solutions recommended by experts (DHHS 1999; Wells et al. 2001; Farmer et al. 2003; Gilbody et al. 2003) include: improving coverage for mental health care services; coordinating resources among different sectors, programs, and systems of care; implementing systematic quality improvement interventions that include physician education, nurse case management, andenhanced linkages between primary care clinicians, schools,and mental health specialists; and increasing the availability of culturally competent care for ethnic minorities. In a study at one school-based health center, screening adolescents for psychosocial problems resulted in decreased ratesof school absence and tardiness among those who were referredfor free mental health services (Gall et al. 2000).

Dental caries (tooth decay) is the most common childhood chronic disease\u2014five times more prevalentthan asthma. Yet, tooth decay is largely preventable with good oralhygiene, diet, and fluoride for parent and child. Once tooth decayoccurs it does not improve without treatment. Left untreated, itcan lead to abscesses and infections, pain, dysfunction, and lowweight (NIDCR 2000). The American Academy of Pediatrics and the American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry recommend that children have anearly assessment to identify those at high risk for tooth decay andthat all children establish a relationship with a regular dentalprovider by age one year (AAPD 2002; AAP 2003). The AmericanAcademy of Pediatric Dentistry and the federal Maternal andChild Health Bureau's Bright Futures initiative recommend two dental visits annually starting at age one year to provide educationand services to prevent tooth decay, although a single annualdental visit may be a more customary practice (Yu et al. 2002). Findings: Among U.S. children and adolescents (ages 2 to 17 years), more than one of four (26%) did not receive dental care in thepast year and one in seven (15%) did not receive any dental carein the past five years, according to parent report in 2000. Minoritychildren, children in families with lower income, and those withpublic or no insurance are less likely to receive regular dental carethan white, nonpoor, and privately insured children (respectively).For example, only one-half of uninsured children and three of fiveHispanic children had a dental visit in the past year and aboutone-quarter did not have a dental visit in the past five years.Although about four of five white, nonpoor, and privately insuredchildren had a dental visit in the past year, one of eight did not have a dental visit in the past five years. Source: National Center for Health Statistics, 2000 National Health Interview Survey, as reported by Blackwell et al. (2003).(Visits may have included both preventive visits and visits to treata dental problem.) Implications: A substantial proportion of U.S. children do not receive regular dental care or any dental care, putting them at riskof serious tooth decay. One-third of children lacked any dentalcoverage in 1996 (Edelstein 2002). Those in low-income familiesare more likely to have dental coverage through enrollment inMedicaid and State Children's Health Insurance Programs(SCHIP). Yet, Medicaid-insured children are less likely to makepreventive dental visits and more likely to have tooth decay(Colmers et al. 1999). Medicaid spends just one-tenth of the national per capita average on dental services for children (Colmers et al. 1999).Few dentists participate in Medicaid because of low reimburse-ment and perceived administrative hassles (GAO 2000). SomeMedicaid and SCHIP programs are increasing the participationof dentists through higher reimbursement and simplifiedadministration, and improving availability and use of servicesthrough greater use of dental hygienists and outreach tobeneficiaries (Almeida et al. 2001; Gehshan et al. 2001; Mofidiet al. 2002). Other barriers to care that need to be addressed forlow-income families include lack of transportation andinability to get time off from work to take a child to the dentist(GAO 2000).Leatherman and McCarthy, Quality of Health Care for Children and Adolescents: A Chartbook, 2004 .

The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends that women initiate prenatal care inthe first three months of their pregnancy. Early initiation ofprenatal care can be beneficial through early identification of riskfactors and provision of preventive advice to encourage healthylifestyle, treatment of conditions such as diabetes and high bloodpressure, and referrals to services such as nutrition and smokingcessation programs (Alexander and Korenbrot 1995; McCormickand Siegel 2001). Prenatal care helps improve maternal health andsurvival and may contribute to improved infant survival by linkingwomen with high-risk pregnancies to better obstetrical andneonatal care (Bronstein et al. 1995; McCormick and Siegel 2001;Vintzileos et al. 2002). Mothers who obtain adequate prenatalcare appear to establish positive care-seeking behavior that makesthem more likely to obtain preventive care for their infants(Kogan et al. 1998). Findings: Among mothers of babies born live in the United States in 2001, one of six (17%) did not start prenatal care in the firsttrimester of her pregnancy\u2014an improvement compared to 1990,when one of four (24%) mothers did not begin prenatal care early. In 2001, state-specific rates of early entry into prenatal care ranged from 69 percent in New Mexico to 91 percent in RhodeIsland. Only three states achieved the national Healthy People2010 goal of 90 percent. Source: National Center for Health Statistics, U.S. birth certificate data, as reported by Martin et al. (2002).Implications: Access to prenatal care improved during the past decade as a result of expansions in Medicaid coverage for low-income pregnant women (Howell 2001). Yet, the women mostlikely to benefit from early and adequate prenatal care because oftheir higher risk of poor birth outcomes\u2014teens, blacks, and thosewho are unmarried and have less education\u2014remain less likely toreceive it (Alexander et al. 2002). Moreover, some women do notreceive all the content of prenatal care recommended by experts(Petersen et al. 2001) and these women are more likely to haveworse birth outcomes (Kogan et al. 1994). Half of women who started prenatal care late said they would have liked to start care earlier, but many didn't know that theywere pregnant (CDC 2000). Commonly cited barriers to prenatalcare include not being able to afford it, lack of transportation andchild care, not being able to get an appointment, and negativeattitudes toward health professionals or health care in general(Alexander and Korenbrot 1995; Sanders-Phillips and Davis 1998;CDC 2000). Despite increased access to prenatal care, rates of premature and low birthweight births have worsened during the past decade(Martin et al. 2002). This trend may be caused by multiple factorsthat adversely affect the health and well-being of disadvantagedwomen throughout their life-course (Lu and Halfon 2003).Further increases in prenatal care may have limited impact onbirth outcomes unless effective medical and psychosocialinterventions can be established and provided to those at need,both before and during pregnancy (Shiono and Behrman 1995;Alexander and Kotelchuck 2001).

(2002).ChildChartbook-Sec3-D3c.qxd 2/23/04 9:57 AM Page 67Why is this important? Children with special health care needs (CSHCN) are defined as those \"who have or are at increased riskfor a chronic physical, developmental, behavioral, or emotionalcondition and who also require health and related services of atype or amount beyond that required by children generally\"(McPherson et al. 1998). About 13 percent of U.S. children and adolescents have existing conditions that meet this definition (Blumberg 2003).* Thesechildren are more likely than other children to be hospitalized,restricted to bed, and absent from school (Newacheck et al. 1998).Access to high-quality health care is important for thesevulnerable children to catch health problems early, keep healthproblems from worsening, limit their adverse impact, andmaintain and restore normal functioning to the degree possible. The federal Maternal and Child Health Bureau has identified six outcome goals for community-based systems of services forCSHCN nationally and at the state level. These goals have beenendorsed by over 70 professional and voluntary organizations(MCHB 2003). Findings: During 2001, parents reported that about one-quarter to one-half (26% to 47%) of CSHCN (ages birth to 17 years) lackedadequate access to or failed to receive the kind of well-organized,continuous, coordinated, comprehensive, and family-centeredcare that experts believe is essential to promote their well-being.Most teens (ages 13-17 years) with special health care needs didnot receive all the services recommended to support theirtransition to adulthood. (See Chart 3:7 for performance on the specific components by which these goals were measured.) Source: National Center for Health Statistics, National Survey of Children with Special Health Care Needs, as reported by theCDC (2003d). Implications: There is substantial room for improvement in serving CSHCN, and especially for teens as they transition to adulthood.Other research has found that CSHCN have more unmet healthcare needs and are less satisfied with their usual source of healthcare than other children, even though they are more likely to haveinsurance coverage and a regular care provider (Newacheck et al.1998; Silver and Stein 2001). Improving community systems of care for these children requires collaborative effort among health professionals, families,health plans, and government and nongovernmentalorganizations (McPherson et al. 1998). Although the childrenrepresented in this data have greatest current needs for care, allchildren can benefit from the kind of community-based caredescribed in the goals shown on these charts. * The National Survey of Children with Special Health Care Needs included nearly all children and adolescents with existing complex health conditions such as autism,cerebral palsy, cystic fibrosis, developmental delay, diabetes, Down syndrome,mental retardation, muscular dystrophy, rare metabolic and genetic disorders,sickle cell disease, and other rare disorders, as well as some children with morecommon conditions such as allergies, asthma, and ADHD who have a high need forservices (Blumberg 2003). The survey did not include children at risk fordeveloping special needs.Leatherman and McCarthy, Quality of Health Care for Children and Adolescents: A Chartbook, 2004 .

The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that all children and adolescents have a primary careprofessional (or a multidisciplinary team for children with severechronic illnesses) whose practice serves as a \"medical home,\" tohelp ensure that health care and other needed services areaccessible, continuous, comprehensive, family-centered,coordinated, culturally competent, and compassionate (AAP2002a; 2002b). A medical home is especially important tochildren with special health care needs and their families, whooften need help to access and integrate needed services from acomplex web of providers and programs (Ziring et al. 1999;Krauss et al. 2001). Research suggests that children who have good primary care have better outcomes (Starfield 1998). Children who havecontinuity with a regular practitioner are more likely to adhere toprescribed medication, receive preventive care and care that iswell-coordinated, resource efficient, and family-centered, lesslikely to have ER visits and hospitalizations, and their physician ismore likely to recognize problems and track information aboutthe child (Starfield 1998; Christakis et al. 2000; 2001c; 2002;2003). Some children seeing specialists as their regular source ofcare report unmet general and preventive care needs, indicating aneed for coordination with primary care (Palfrey et al. 1980;Carroll et al. 1983). Findings: Among the states during 2001, the proportion of children with special health care needs (ages birth to 17 years) whoreceived coordinated, ongoing comprehensive care in a medical home ranged from 41 percent in the District of Columbia to 61percent in Massachusetts. (The components of the medical home measure are shown on Chart 3:7A.) Source: National Center for Health Statistics, National Survey of Children with Special Health Care Needs, as reported by theCDC (CDC 2003d). Implications: Many CSHCN do not receive care that meets the elements of a medical home. Barriers that must be overcome toachieve the medical home for all children include lack ofadequate reimbursement for coordination services, lack ofavailable community services, and fragmentation among differentprograms, health plans, and providers serving these children(Regalado and Halfon 2002). Some states are partnering with and providing resources to support health care providers and other community-basedorganizations to create integrated systems of care (Gillespie andMollica 2003). Tools and resources are available to train andsupport physician practices in developing and improving theirmedical home for pediatric patients (Silva et al. 2000; CMHI2003; NCMHI 2003). Improved coordination and coverage ofservices needed by children with chronic illnesses reducedhospitalizations and health care costs in one community (Liptaket al. 1998). Electronic records may help improve coordinationand information tracking among different health care providers(Starfield et al. 1977).Leatherman and McCarthy, Quality of Health Care for Children and Adolescents: A Chartbook, 2004 .

Componentsof this measure include: child had a usual source of care, child had a personal doctoror nurse, effective care coordination was received when needed, child had no problems obtaining referrals when specialty care was needed, and child receivedfamily-centered care.ChildChartbook-Sec3-D3c.qxd 2/23/04 9:57 AM Page 73Why is this important? Parents have a substantial role in seeking and overseeing their child's health care. Parents' perceptions ofinterpersonal communication and time spent with healthprofessionals are important indicators of patient and familycenteredness and are closely tied to overall assessments of thequality of care (Gross et al. 1998; Homer et al. 1999; Darby 2002). The quality of parents' communication with their child's health professional may affect parents' receptivity to receivingadvice, how they oversee their child's compliance with treatmentregimens, and satisfaction with and outcomes of care (Korsch etal. 1968; Francis et al. 1969; Stewart 1995). The amount of timethat parents and pediatric patients have with clinicians may affecttheir ability to raise questions or address issues that fall outsidethe stated reason for a visit. Findings: In 2000, among children and adolescents (ages birth to 17 years) who received health care in the past year: About one of three parents (32% to 35%) reported that the child's doctor or other health professional did not alwayscommunicate well (in terms of listening carefully, showingrespect, and explaining things well). More than four of 10 parents (44%) reported that the doctor or other health professional did not always spend enoughtime with the parent and child. Children and adolescents without insurance or covered only by public insurance (such as Medicaid) were more likely thanthose with any private insurance to have a parent report gaps intimely access to and quality of care.Source: Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (AHRQ 2002b). Implications: Improvements are needed to better meet parent expectations. Interpersonal deficits in care may account for someof the perception of inadequate time spent with the patient andparent (Gross et al. 1998). Greater attention also needs to be paidto the child's role in communications with health professionals(Tates and Meeuwesen 2001). Interventions that might addressthese gaps include: education and incentives for health professionals and their staff to help improve patient-centered communication skills(Lewin et al. 2001); formal or informal patient feedback to help professionals assess needs for improvement (O'Keefe 2001); culturally relevant questionnaires, written and audiovisual materials, and coaching in the waiting room to help prepareparents and children for effective health care encounters (Postet al. 2002; Ashton et al. 2003); interpreter services and teams of professionals that include at least one bilingual professional to overcome language barriers(Brach and Fraser 2000); use of mid-level practitioners (physician assistants and nurse practitioners) to increase time spent with patients duringintake and follow-up care (Berry et al. 2003); and follow-up services such as telephone calls to determine how the child is doing post-care (Car and Sheikh 2003).Leatherman and McCarthy, Quality of Health Care for Children and Adolescents: A Chartbook, 2004 .

Many hospitals are interested in learning about patients' experiences in an effort to promote patient-centered caregiving and to identify processes of care that they cantake steps to improve. Hundreds of hospitals internationally usePicker Institute surveys to assess patients' impressions of specificaspects of hospital care, which are conceptually grouped intoseven dimensions of quality (Cleary et al. 1991; Co et al. 2003).Example questions asked for the pediatric survey (severalquestions are asked in each of these dimensions) include: Information to the child : Was information discussed in a way that your child could understand? C oordination of care : Did one doctor or nurse say one thing and then another say something quite different? Partnership in care : How much did you participate in your child's care? Information to parents : When you had important questions to ask the doctors, did you get answers you could understand? Confidence and trust : Did you have confidence and trust in the doctors caring for your child? Continuity and transition : Did someone on the hospital staff tell you what you needed to know to care for your child at home? Physical comfort : Was the pain your child experienced more than you were told it would be?Findings: Summing across 38 hospitals that used the Picker Institute Pediatric Inpatient Survey during 1997-1999 (primarily academicor teaching institutions), parents reported problems on 18 percentto 33 percent of the questions that they were asked within each ofseven dimensions of patient-centered quality of care (multiplequestions were asked within each dimension). Averaging across allseven dimensions, parents reported problems on more than one-quarter (27%) of the measures of hospital care for children whowere treated for medical conditions (not surgical or intensive care)at these hospitals. Source: Picker Institute Pediatric Inpatient Survey, as reported by Co et al. (2003). Results may not be representativeof all hospitals. Implications: These data demonstrate the importance of asking specific questions to identify hospital care processes that warrantattention and improvement. Parents' overall rating of quality(not shown) correlated most strongly with being providedinformation and partnership in care, \"indicating that parentsview being kept informed and involved in the care of their childas the highest priority dimensions of patient-centered quality ofcare\" (Co et al. 2003). Compared to similar surveys measuring adults' perceptions of their own care in the hospital, parents reported relatively moreproblems for children in most dimensions, includingcoordination of care, information sharing, partnership in care(respect for patient preferences), and physical comfort. Adultsreported more problems for continuity and transition (Coulterand Cleary 2001).Leatherman and McCarthy, Quality of Health Care for Children and Adolescents: A Chartbook, 2004 .

(2003). Results may not be representative of all U.S. hospitals.Adapted and reproduced by permission of Pediatrics , Volume 111, Page 311, Figure 1, Copyright 2003.ChildChartbook-Sec4-D3a.qxd 2/19/04 11:30 AM Page 77Why is this important? Children's health and development depends heavily on family well-being (Schor 2003). Family stressor dysfunction from factors such as poverty, parental depression,and substance abuse in the home can disrupt parenting and putchildren at risk of developmental, behavioral, and emotionalproblems. On the other hand, parents who quit smoking notonly avoid exposing their child to second-hand smoke but alsoreduce the likelihood that their child will take up smoking(Farkas et al. 1999). To help children achieve better outcomes, the American Academy of Pediatrics' Task Force on the Family recommendedthat pediatricians \"strengthen parental partnerships in differentfamily types, screen for family circumstances that put children atrisk, and help create family-friendly practice environments\"(Schor 2003). Family-oriented care also is a core attribute offamily practice as articulated by the American Academy ofFamily Physicians. While most physicians say that they involve families in decision-making around children, family-oriented pediatric caregoes further by addressing family issues that may affect the healthand well-being of children\u2014such as by providing briefcounseling or referring a parent for treatment or services whenappropriate (Schor 2003). Findings: In a national survey in 2000, the majority (56% to 94%) of parents of young children (ages 4 to 35 months) agreed thattheir child's doctor or health professional should ask about sixtopics related to family well-being, including parents' health andemotional support, violence in the community, difficulty providing for the child's needs, and substance abuse and tobaccouse in the household. More than three-quarters (77%) of parentsreported being asked whether a household member smokedtobacco. Less than half (10% to 44%) of parents reported thathealth professionals had discussed the other five topics with them.Parent emotional support and economic concerns were the topicsexhibiting the greatest divergence between parent endorsementand actual discussion. Source: National Center for Health Statistics, National Survey of Early Childhood Health, as reported by Halfon et al. (2002). Implications: These data suggest that parents potentially agree with a family-oriented approach to pediatric care, but it may not yet beuniversally accepted in practice. In another study of primary carepractices, two of three mothers of young children reported healthbehaviors or conditions (such as smoking or depression) that mayaffect children; most said that they \"would welcome\" or \"wouldnot mind\" screening and referral for services at their child's visit(Kahn et al. 1999). Yet, a survey of pediatricians found that onlyone-third conduct family risk assessments (Minkovitz et al. 1998). One study found that it is feasible to provide brief smoking cessation counseling and Nicotine Replacement Therapy forparents at pediatric visits along with referrals to primary care andfollow-up telephone counseling (Winickoff et al. 2003). Greaterknowledge is needed about other interventions to realize the goalsof family-oriented care.Leatherman and McCarthy, Quality of Health Care for Children and Adolescents: A Chartbook, 2004 .

Without regular preventive health care visits for children and adolescents, immunizations may bedelayed, health and developmental problems may go undetected,parents will not receive advice on child safety and childrearing,and adolescents will miss the opportunity for counseling toencourage healthy lifestyles and help prevent risky behaviors. Lackof preventive care is associated with more ER visits and avoidablehospitalizations among young children (Hakim and Bye 2001;Hakim and Ronsaville 2002). Findings: Among children and adolescents (ages 3 to 17 years) in 1999, those with public insurance, minorities, and those withfamily income below poverty were more likely than those withprivate or no insurance, whites, and those with family incomeabove poverty (respectively) to receive preventive health care(well-child) visits at recommended ages in the past year.* One of three (32%) without insurance missed well-child visits, compared to one of four (24%) with private insurance andone of seven (15%) with public insurance. One of eight black children (12%) and one of five of Hispanic ethnicity (21%) or other race (22%) missed well-child visits,versus one of four white children (26%). One of six (17%) in families with income below the poverty level, versus one of four (24% to 26%) in families withincome above poverty, missed preventive visits. Source: Urban Institute/Child Trends, 1999 National Survey of America's Families, as reported by Yu et al. (2002).Implications: The higher rate of preventive health care visits among minority and poor children probably reflects more comprehensivecoverage of preventive care for low-income children enrolled inMedicaid and State Children's Health Insurance Programs(SCHIP). Federal standards for Medicaid Early and PeriodicScreening Diagnosis and Treatment (EPSDT) require coverage ofpreventive health care visits in accordance with expertrecommendations. Two-thirds of the states operate their SCHIPprograms in whole or in part as a Medicaid expansion subject tothe EPSDT requirements. Medicaid prohibits cost-sharing forcategorically needy children and both Medicaid and SCHIP limitcopayments for other children (Pernice et al. 2001). Improving rates of preventive care for children requires expanding coverage for the uninsured and outreach to parents toencourage greater preventive care-seeking. Reducing patient out-of-pocket costs has been shown to increase immunization rates(Briss et al. 2000). Private sector purchasers and health plansshould consider whether it would be cost-effective and feasible toreduce out-of-pocket costs to encourage greater use of preventivecare among privately insured children. Primary care also needs tobe made more accessible, especially for low-income families(Slifkin et al. 2002) (see Chart 3:1) . * Other research has found that minority and Medicaid-insured young children are less likely to receive recommended well-child visits than are white and privatelyinsured young children (Ronsaville and Hakim et al. 2000; Thompson et al. 2003).Leatherman and McCarthy, Quality of Health Care for Children and Adolescents: A Chartbook, 2004 .

High rates of vaccination are needed to protect against periodic outbreaks of infectious disease. Themeasles epidemic of 1989-1991, which caused 120 deaths and1 1,000 hospitalizations (DHHS 2000a), was associated with inner-city and minority preschoolchildren (NVAC 1991; Gindler et al. 1992). A review of research bythe National Vaccine Advisory Committee concluded that the\"most powerful and persistent barriers to timely immunizationare poverty and factors associated with poverty\" (NVAC 1999). Findings: Poor, minority, and urban children are less likely than nonpoor, white, and suburban children (respectively) to be up todate on recommended childhood immunizations. From 1994 to2002, the disparity in combined coverage rate for four keyimmunizations among children ages 19 to 35 months: narrowed between poor and nonpoor children (from an 1 1 percentage point difference in 1994 to a 7 percentage pointdifference in 2002); narrowed between Hispanic and white children (from 10 percentage points in 1994 to 4 percentage points in 2002); widened between black and white children (from 5 percentage points in 1994 to 9 percentage points in 2002); widened between urban and suburban children (from 2 percentage points in 1994 to 5 percentage points in 2002). Source: National Center for Health Statistics, National Immunization Survey, as reported by Eberhardt et al. (2001) andthe CDC (2003e).Implications: Actions to increase childhood immunizations must include ways to eliminate disparities for vulnerable children.Parents may face obstacles to obtaining timely immunization fortheir children, including inadequate clinic hours and convenientlocations (Orenstein et al. 1990). Many parents cannot rememberthe immunization schedule (NVAC 1999) and many health careproviders do not send parents reminders when immunizations aredue (Tierney et al. 2003). Moreover, some eligible children are notimmunized when they do have contact with the health caresystem (Szilagyi and Rodewald 1996). Initiatives to link immunization to the federal Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, andChildren (WIC) have increased immunization rates up to 34percentage points among low-income children. Interventions haveincluded education, assessment, referral, and incentives (varyingthe frequency of required voucher pick-up based onimmunization status) (Briss et al. 2000). Several studies have that found home visiting programs can be effective in increasing immunization rates among hard-to-reach subpopulations (such as children living in public housingcommunities), although they can be resource intensive (Briss etal. 2000). One innovative program reduced disparities byassigning lay outreach workers to help inner-city physicianpractices track immunization status, contact families by mail,telephone, or home visits (for those with complex needs), andprovide assistance with scheduling or transportation as needed(Szilagyi et al. 2002).Leatherman and McCarthy, Quality of Health Care for Children and Adolescents: A Chartbook, 2004 .

Although the burden of asthma has been increasing among all children in the U.S, minority and poorchildren suffer disproportionately from asthma (Akinbami et al.2002). For example, compared to white children, black childrenare 44 percent more likely to have an asthma attack, three timesmore likely to visit an emergency room and to be hospitalized,and four times more likely to die from asthma. Good asthmamanagement in accordance with national guidelines\u2014such ashaving a written plan to manage asthma at home and using anti-inflammatory medication when indicated to control underlyingsymptoms\u2014can prevent asthma attacks and reduce adverseoutcomes such as emergency room visits and hospitalizations(NAEPP 1997). Findings: In 1999, rates of using recommended medication and having a written management plan were low among all Medicaid-insured children (ages 2 to 16 years) with asthma enrolled in fivemanaged health care plans. Compared to white children, black and Latino children were equally or more likely to have made a primary care visit forasthma care, to have seen a specialist for asthma care, and to havean asthma management plan, suggesting similar access to care.Yet, black and Latino children were less likely to be regularly usingan inhaled anti-inflammatory medication when indicated forpersistent asthma, despite having worse asthma than whitechildren. Source: parent telephone interviews and computerized medical records and claims data (Lieu et al. 2002).Implications: Racial and ethnic differences in asthma anti- inflammatory medication use persist among low-income childreneven when they are equally insured with full prescription drugcoverage. This disparity may reflect deficiencies in both physicianprescribing and patient adherence. Other research suggests that minority families are more likely than white families to view asthma as being uncontrollable and tohave negative attitudes about anti-inflammatory medications(Yoos et al. 2003). Cultural and ethnic differences incommunication between physicians and parents and olderchildren may prevent the physician from making an accuratediagnosis and treatment plan as well as lead to poorunderstanding of the physician's recommendations and, thus, lessadherence to treatment regimens (Flores et al. 2002). Several interventions have improved asthma care and outcomes for low-income and minority children living in theinner city, including use of: evidence-based professional education and supports for practitioners in inner-city public health clinics serving children(Evans et al. 1997), intensive patient and family education and outreach at an inner-city hospital specialty clinic (Kelly et al. 2000) (see Chart 6:7) , and social workers to improve communication between inner-city children and their physicians (Evans et al. 1999).Leatherman and McCarthy, Quality of Health Care for Children and Adolescents: A Chartbook, 2004 .

Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is the most commonly diagnosed childhood behavioralproblem in the U.S. (NIMH 1999). Seven percent of children andadolescents have been diagnosed with ADHD, according to parentreport in 2000 (Blackwell et al. 2003). Treatment for ADHD\u2014which may include medication and/or behavioral therapy\u2014canimprove symptoms and academic performance (Dulcan 1997;AHRQ 1999; AAP 2001). Several studies have reported that girls and minorities are less likely to receive ADHD treatment; such disparities may arise frommultiple factors including recognition by parents and teachers,care-seeking behaviors, barriers to accessing care, and actions ofhealth professionals (Bussing et al. 2003). Findings: In a 1998 study in one school district, most elementary school-age children identified by researchers as havingsymptoms of ADHD were recognized by their parent as havingbehavior problems. Among these children, boys were morelikely than girls and white children were more likely thanAfrican American children to have been professionallyevaluated, diagnosed, and treated for ADHD. Those with aregular source of health care were more likely to be evaluated(data not shown). Source: parent and teacher surveys (Bussing et al. 2003).Implications: This study suggests that seeking professional evaluation is a key factor determining treatment for ADHD. Girlswith ADHD may be less likely than boys with ADHD to manifestbehaviors that prompt parents to seek evaluation (Gaub andCarlson 1997). African American parents are less likely than whiteparents to know about ADHD, less likely to receive informationabout ADHD from their child's health professional, and morelikely to report low expectations for health care\u2014all potentialbarriers to seeking help for their children (Bussing et al. 2003). Providing education for parents of children with symptoms of ADHD, ensuring support from school personnel, and providingimproved access to family-centered, routine pediatric care mayhelp to reduce disparity in care-seeking (Bussing et al. 2003). TheNational Initiative for Children's Healthcare Quality has developeda toolkit\u2014including educational resources for ADHD (NICHQ 2003a), basedon evidence-based guidelines developed by the American Academyof Pediatrics (AAP 2001). The AAP has incorporated these toolsinto an online learning program called Education in Quality Improvement for Pediatric Practice (McInerny et al. 2003).Leatherman and McCarthy, Quality of Health Care for Children and Adolescents: A Chartbook, 2004 .

Children living in poverty have worse health and greater disability than children in higher incomefamilies, even when they suffer from the same diseases (Starfield1997). Families with low income are less likely to have healthinsurance and their children are less likely to get needed healthcare. Moreover, poverty is associated with other risk factors such aspoor living conditions and inadequate nutrition (Starfield 1997). Children with special health care needs (CSHCN*) are more likely than other children to have unmet needs for health careacross all income levels (Silver and Stein 2001). These childrenmay be especially vulnerable to the effects of income disparities inaccess to care and in the degree to which services are tailored tomeet the family's unique needs (Newacheck et al. 1998). See Chart 3:6 for additional background on this population. Findings: In 2001, parents of children with special health care needs (ages birth to 17 years) with family income below thefederal poverty level were three-and-one-half times more likelythan those with higher family income (400 percent of poverty orhigher) to report that their child had one or more unmet needsfor health care (32% vs. 9%) and twice as likely to report a lackof family centeredness (50% vs. 25%) in the health care that theirchild did receive.** Source: National Center for Health Statistics, National Survey of Children with Special Health Care Needs, as reported by vanDyck (2003) and Blumberg (2003).Implications: Children with special health care needs who \"experienc[e] the greatest difficulties are concentrated among themost disadvantaged segments of [this] population\" (Newachecket al. 2003). Lack of or inadequate insurance coverage and otheraccess barriers such as lack of transportation may be especiallyproblematic for low-income families whose children have specialhealth care needs. Children with special health care needs insured by public programs such as Medicaid are more likely than those withoutinsurance, but less likely than those with private insurance, to seea regular health professional and to have access to after-hourscare (Newacheck et al. 2000b). These families may especiallybenefit from more comprehensive coverage, greater integrationamong health and social programs, improved communityservices, and culturally sensitive, family-centered assistance tonavigate the health care system (Halfon and Hochstein 1997;Garwick et al. 1998). * Children with special health care needs are defined as those \"who have or are at increased risk for a chronic physical, developmental, behavioral, or emotionalcondition and who also require health and related services of a type or amount beyondthat required by children generally \" (McPherson et al. 1998). The survey identified only those with existing conditions, not those at risk of developing special needs. ** Family-centered care means that the doctor usually or always spends enough time, listens carefully, provides needed information, is sensitive to the family 's culture and values, and makes the family feel like a partner.Leatherman and McCarthy, Quality of Health Care for Children and Adolescents: A Chartbook, 2004 .

Racial and ethnic minorities may have unique cultural beliefs and practices as well as languagedifferences that affect their access to and experience with healthcare (Flores and Vega 1998; Flores et al. 2002). \"Ethnic andcultural norms influence a patient's propensity to ask questions,express concerns, and be assertive during a medical interaction,\"which may influence a physician's propensity to shareinformation and express empathy (Ashton et al. 2003). Adverseconsequences of cultural and language differences in health carefor children may include misdiagnosis, misunderstanding oftreatment instructions, and inappropriate medication, testing, andhospitalization (Flores et al. 1998; 2002). One of every 12 U.S. residents (8%) speaks a language other than English at home and does not speak English very well or at all (U.S. Census Bureau 2003). Courses in English as a secondlanguage typically do not teach the terminology needed tocommunicate well about medical care (Downing and Roat 2002).A national survey found that only half of Spanish-speakingHispanics who needed an interpreter to speak with their doctoralways or usually had access to one (Doty 2003). Another studyfound a high rate of errors in interpreting, especially by ad hoc interpreters, during pediatric visits at one hospital outpatientclinic (Flores et al. 2003). Only five states currently use federal-state matching funds to pay for language services as part ofMedicaid and SCHIP programs (Andrulis et al. 2002).Findings: Minority parents of children (ages birth to 17 years) enrolled in Medicaid managed care plans in six states, surveyedduring 1997-1998, generally rated accessibility and interpersonalquality of care lower than did white parents. Most ratings weresignificantly lower for parents who identified themselves asblack/African American or American Indian/Alaskan Natives(nearly all of whom were English-speaking). Those who identifiedthemselves as Asian/Pacific Islander or of Hispanic ethnicity and who did not speak English as their primary language gavesignificantly lower ratings than both white parents and theirEnglish-speaking Asian and Hispanic counterparts. Source: Consumer Assessment of Health Plans (CAHPS) Benchmarking Database, as reported by Weech-Maldonado et al.(2001), and personal communication with Robert Weech-Maldonado (2003). Implications: Language barriers and communication problems may figure prominently in disparities for racial and ethnic minorities(Ashton et al. 2003). Policy options for overcoming these barriersinclude increasing the availability of competent interpreter services(including appropriately trained and supervised volunteers) and ofbilingual and minority health professionals and staff, andencouraging the use of culturally and language- and literacy-appropriate materials (Betancourt et al. 2002; Downing and Roat2002). Experts recommend that doctors evaluate theircommunication competence and seek training when needed toimprove culturally competent health care, such as by helpingpatients to ask questions and express concerns (Ashton et al. 2003).Leatherman and McCarthy, Quality of Health Care for Children and Adolescents: A Chartbook, 2004 .

Research indicates that primary care practitioners improve their ability to deliver preventive care whenthey adopt a systematic, organized approach\u2014such as usinginformation tools, improving office processes, and increasingteamwork among office staff (Dietrich et al. 1997; Dickey et al.1999; Goodwin et al. 2001). Yet, less than half of primary carephysicians report using such office systems (Dickey and Kamerow1996). For example, only two of five pediatricians (38%) reportassessing immunization performance and one of six (16%)report using systems to remind parents about upcoming oroverdue immunizations (Tierney et al. 2003) \u2014techniques that are effective and recommended for improving immunizationrates (CDC 1999a). Intervention: This study evaluated the impact of a year-long, community-wide collaborative effort to increase preventive carefor young children (Bordley et al. 2001). All the major primarycare group practices and clinics serving young children inDurham, North Carolina, established multidisciplinary teams andreceived technical assistance to set objectives, monitorperformance, and adopt or enhance quality-improvement systemsdirected at one or more levels: 1.patients \u2014educational materials and activation cards to prompt discussions with the doctor or nurse; 2.practitioners \u2014post-it reminders on patient charts and risk assessments to prompt screening when appropriate; and 3.the practice \u2014chart prescreening to identify needed services, flowsheets indicating recommended age-specific services, andtracking systems to identify patients in need of care.Findings: After the intervention, the combined rates of preventive care provided to patients of these practices increased significantlyfor three of four project goals compared to preintervention rates: being up to date on immunizations (by 7 percentage points at age 12 months and by 12 percentage points at age 24 months), screening for anemia (by 30 percentage points), and screening (risk assessment or blood testing) for lead poisoning (by 36 percentage points). Rates of screening for tuberculosis, the fourth goal, increased at practices that focused on this objective but not in aggregate(data not shown). Source: random samples of medical records (Bordley et al. 2001). Implications: With assistance, primary care practitioners can establish and improve office systems to increase preventive carefor children. The degree of improvement achieved varied amongpractices depending on whether they targeted a particular servicefor improvement and based on their ability to successfullyimplement changes in office systems (Bordley et al. 2001).Controlled studies may be useful to verify the effectiveness of thisapproach and compare the relative effectiveness of different tools.Other research suggests that having an organizational\"champion\" is important to lead efforts at adopting such tools(Tierney et al. 2003).Leatherman and McCarthy, Quality of Health Care for Children and Adolescents: A Chartbook, 2004 .

Recent research has led to new appreciation for the importance of early life experience in shapingchildren's intellectual, emotional, and social development (NRC2000). Yet, changes in family and society are challenging parentsand creating stresses that can harm children's life chances(Carnegie 1994). Reflecting this dynamic, many parents say theywant more information about child development from theirhealth professional (see Chart 1:3) . Primary health care appears to offer an excellent opportunity to support parents in creating theenvironment for favorable developmental outcomes, since mostyoung children already have regular contact with a primary carepractitioner for immunizations and other well-child care (AHRQ2002a; VanLandeghem et al. 2002). Intervention: The Healthy Steps for Young Children program promotes a new multidisciplinary model of pediatric careemphasizing \"a close relationship between health careprofessionals and mothers and fathers in addressing the physical,emotional, and intellectual growth and development of childrenfrom birth to age three\" (Healthy Steps 2003). The programintegrates a trained child development specialist (nurse, earlychildhood educator, or social worker with experience in childdevelopment) into primary care practices to enhancedevelopmental information and other services, including:enhanced well-child care, child development and family healthcheckups, home visits at critical developmental stages, telephonehotline for parents to discuss developmental concerns, parentsupport groups, written information materials, and linkage tocommunity resources.Findings: Parents of young children (ages 30 to 33 months) taking part in the Healthy Steps program at 15 primary health care siteswere more likely than parents with usual care at the same ormatched sites to report: receiving developmental information and services promoted by the program, being satisfied with support from the practice and communication with health professionals, engaging in nonphysical child discipline behaviors promoted by the program, discussing their own sadness with someone at the practice (among mothers at risk for depression), and maintaining continuity of care at the same practice after their child reached age 20 months. Children enrolled in Healthy Steps were more likely to receive well-child visits at recommended ages and to be up to date onselected immunizations at age 24 months. Source: Parent interviews and medical records (Minkovitz et al. 2003). Implications: Enhancing early child development services in primary care will require structural changes in practice. Given current healthcare market constraints, the authors conclude, \"it is unlikely thatphysicians will be able to extend the length of visits or providemore direct services to families without relying on otherprofessional staff\" (Minkovitz et al. 2001). The Healthy Stepsprogram represents one model for accomplishing this goal, with anincremental cost ranging from $402 to $933 per child per year.Leatherman and McCarthy, Quality of Health Care for Children and Adolescents: A Chartbook, 2004 .

Young children are susceptible to lead poisoning when exposed to lead in their environment, especiallydeteriorating lead-based paint and paint dust in older housing(NRC 1993). Low-level lead poisoning typically does notmanifest in medical symptoms and therefore cannot be detectedwithout blood testing. Lead poisoning is associated withdevelopmental delays, learning disabilities, and behavioralproblems (AAP 1998a). Lead poisoning has been declining in the U.S. since lead was banned in paint and gasoline. Yet, 8 percent of low-incomeyoung children (ages birth to 5 years) and 1 1 percent of youngblack children had elevated blood lead levels (greater than 10micrograms per deciliter) in 1991-1994, compared to 4 percentof children generally (CDC 1997a). Three of five youngchildren (62%) with elevated blood levels are enrolled inMedicaid (GAO 1999). The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend lead screening for young children at risk of lead poisoning\u2014including all low-income children receiving public assistance\u2014toidentify those in need of interventions to lower blood lead levels(CDC 1991; 1997b). Interventions depend on severity of leadtoxicity and may include follow-up testing, family education,abatement of the source of lead exposure, and medicalmanagement. The federal government has required since 1992that all Medicaid-insured children receive a blood lead test at ages1 and 2 years, and that children age 36 to 72 months be tested ifthey have not previously been screened. Only half the states hadfully complied with this policy as of 1999 (GAO 1999). Intervention: The State of Rhode Island requires universal lead screening of all young children and promotes screening through amultifaceted educational and outreach strategy (Rhode IslandDOH 2003). A statewide public health tracking system is used tonotify managed care plans, health professionals, and clinics ofchildren who are in need of screening (AECLP 2001). Head Startproviders and Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) nutritionclinics also check children's status and notify physicians whenscreening is needed (personal communication with MagalyAngeloni 2003). Medicaid managed care plans are eligible forstate performance incentives for meeting goals including leadscreening rates. The state offers bilingual case managementservices and an abatement program that funds replacement oflead-painted windows (Silow-Carroll 2003). Findings: During 1996-1997, 80 percent of Rhode Island children (ages 19 to 35 months) who were enrolled in the state's Medicaidmanaged care program for at least one year had ever received ablood lead test. In contrast, only 21 percent of young childrenwho were enrolled in traditional Medicaid in 15 other states for atleast one year during 1995-1996 had received a blood lead testwithin six months of their first or second birthday (state ratesranged from 1 percent to 46 percent). Sources: medical records (Vivier et al. 2001); Medicaid administrative claims data (GAO 1999). Implications: A multifaceted statewide education and outreach intervention can increase lead screening rates to high levels amonglow-income young children.Leatherman and McCarthy, Quality of Health Care for Children and Adolescents: A Chartbook, 2004 .

Adolescents face many behavioral and lifestyle choices\u2014such as whether to use tobacco, alcohol, ordrugs, eat healthy foods, get regular exercise, engage in risky sexualbehaviors, and take precautions to prevent injury\u2014that can haveboth immediate and lasting consequences for their health andsuccess in life (Klein and Auerbach 2002). The American Medical Association's Guidelines for Adolescent Preventive Services (GAPS) recommend that physicians provide guidance to adolescents to help encourage healthy lifestyles andscreen for medical, behavioral, and emotional problems for whichtreatment, counseling, or referral to other services is indicated(Elster and Kuznets 1994). Many adolescents reporting health orbehavioral risks say they would like to discuss these issues with aphysician, yet most have not done so (Klein and Wilson 2002). Intervention: This study evaluated the experience of five urban and rural community and migrant health centers (CMHCs) thatreceived training and technical assistance to implement theAmerican Medical Association's Guidelines for Adolescent Preventive Services (GAPS) among poor and uninsured adolescents ages 14 to 19 years (Klein et al. 2001). All five CMHCs made improvementsin preventive care delivery including: scheduling 30-minute well-child visits, encouraging confidential counseling time, using apatient questionnaire to screen for health risks, and enhancingpatient education materials and referral networks when possible.Findings: Adolescents visiting for well-child care nine to 15 months after GAPS implementation were significantly more likely thanthose who had visited before the intervention to report receivingeducational materials and discussing preventive topics with theirhealth professional in 19 of 31 content areas. Rates of counselingwere 10 to 29 percentage points higher for these 19 topics after theintervention. Rates of counseling did not increase significantly fortopics that had relatively higher rates before the intervention. Source: patient surveys (Klein et al. 2001). (The chart displays the 10 topics with the greatest absolute increase inreported discussion.) Implications: Health centers and similar clinical practice settings can improve preventive care for adolescents when they adoptguidelines along with a program of supportive practiceimprovements. Given limited time and the need to tailorscreening and counseling to meet individual patient needs, ratesof 100 percent would not be expected across all topics for everyvisit, but there is room for additional improvement. Effectivelycoordinating preventive care for adolescents requires commitmentto recognize adolescents' unique developmental needs as well asthe importance of providing adequate time and privacy forconfidential screening and counseling (Klein et al. 2001).Leatherman and McCarthy, Quality of Health Care for Children and Adolescents: A Chartbook, 2004 .

Expert recommendations to screen sexually active adolescent girls for chlamydia infection are not widelyfollowed in routine clinical practice (see Chart 1:6) . This gap in quality results in many missed opportunities to treat patients whohave contracted this sexually transmitted disease without knowingit and who remain at risk of developing potentially severecomplications. Intervention: This study tested the effectiveness of an intervention to increase compliance with screening guidelines for an ethnicallydiverse population of adolescent girls (ages 14 to 18 years) duringcheckup visits (Shafer et al. 2002). Ten pediatric clinics of a largehealth maintenance organization were randomly assigned toprovide usual care or to implement the intervention. To reducescreening barriers, all clinics used a urine test (rather than cultureobtained through pelvic exam). The intervention consisted of: 1. engaging clinic leadership and raising awareness of the gap in quality; 2. building teams at each clinic to implement the intervention, including identifying and addressing barriers to improvement; 3. developing clinical practice improvements such as customizing clinic flowcharts to summarize patient information from multiplesources, instituting universal urine specimen collection at patientregistration (but only specimens from sexually active girls, asdetermined confidentially by the practitioner, were sent forlaboratory analysis), and raising awareness about screeningthrough an educational campaign; and 4. sustaining gains through continuous performance monitoring. Findings: Before the intervention, the 10 clinics did not differ significantly in the proportion of sexually active adolescent girlsscreened for chlamydia infection at preventive health visits; bothgroups had very low rates of such screening. During visits 16 to 18months after the intervention, the proportion of girls screened forchlamydia infection had increased significantly in the interventionclinics (from 5% before to 65% after the intervention) and wassignificantly higher than in the usual care clinics (21%). Source: Patient encounter and laboratory data (Shafer et al. 2002). Implications: A multifaceted, systems-level intervention can increase rates of screening for chlamydia infection in organized grouppractice and may be replicable to other similar practice settings.Leatherman and McCarthy, Quality of Health Care for Children and Adolescents: A Chartbook, 2004 .

Thisgoal may be especially important among young children, whohave a higher rate of infection with antibiotic-resistant pathogensthan other age groups (Whitney et al. 2000). Although physicianshave reduced antibiotic prescribing over the past decade (McCaiget al. 2002), further progress is needed (see Chart 1:7) . Many physicians say that parents pressure them to prescribe antibioticsfor a sick child when antibiotics are not clinically indicated(Bauchner et al. 1999). A multifaceted intervention to educatepatients and physicians was successful in reducing unnecessaryantibiotic use among adults (Gonzales et al. 2001). Intervention: This study evaluated a one-year targeted educational intervention to reduce unnecessary antibiotic prescriptions forchildren (Finkelstein et al. 2001). Twelve urban and suburbangroup practices and multispecialty clinics affiliated with twogeographically unique managed health care plans wererandomized by matched pairs to intervention and control groups. Parents of enrolled children receiving care at intervention practices were mailed a pamphlet on appropriate antibiotic usethat was developed by the Centers for Disease Control andPrevention (CDC), with a cover letter signed by their physician.Additional CDC pamphlets and posters were displayed inintervention clinic waiting rooms. A CDC-trained pediatric peerleader conducted small-group educational sessions with physicians in the intervention practices at the start of theintervention and again four months later, with the follow-uppresentation including feedback on group and individualphysician antibiotic prescribing performance. Findings: Antibiotic dispensing decreased by 10 percent to 12 percent from the baseline to the intervention year among youngchildren visiting control group practices, probably because ofnational public health initiatives. Antibiotic dispensing decreasedsignificantly more, by 15 percent to 19 percent, in the interventionclinics. Among children who visited in both the baseline andintervention years (data not shown), there was a \"relativeintervention effect\" of 12 percent to 16 percent fewer antibioticsdispensed in the intervention practices, beyond the change inantibiotic use in the control practices after adjusting for baselineuse of antibiotics. Source: computerized claims data (Finkelstein et al. 2001). Implications: A multifaceted educational intervention directed at both physicians and parents was successful in boosting thereduction in antibiotic prescribing beyond the preexisting trendtoward lower antibiotic use.Leatherman and McCarthy, Quality of Health Care for Children and Adolescents: A Chartbook, 2004 .

Many children with asthma and their families are not practicing effective asthma management,including the regular use of anti-inflammatory medication whenindicated to control asthma symptoms (see Chart 1:8) . Poor and minority children suffer disproportionately from asthma and itsconsequences (Akinbami et al. 2002); hence, they may have evengreater need for improvement in care and outcomes. Passiveeducation alone is not enough to bring about change, but moreintensive programs can be effective (Guevara et al. 2003). Intervention: This study examined the effect of an intensive asthma education and outreach program at an inner-city hospitalspecialty clinic (Kelly et al. 2000). Medicaid-insured children andadolescents (ages 2 to 16 years) who had visited the emergencyroom twice or been hospitalized once in the past year, and whoconsented to participate, were alternately assigned to anintervention or control group. There were no baseline differencesbetween the groups. The intervention group children and their caregiver received individual asthma self-management education and a written actionplan for exacerbations. An outreach nurse contacted these childrenonce per month to monitor their status, review medications, refillprescription, schedule follow-up care, and assist withtransportation needs. The nurse worked with school personnel onbehalf of school-age children. Intervention group children coulduse the specialty clinic for care, but control group children werereferred to their primary care physician for treatment.Findings: During the intervention year, children in the intervention group received better quality of care, as measured by 95 percentwho received an influenza immunization compared to 23 percentof children in the control group. Use of anti-inflammatorymedication increased nearly three-fold (from 34% to 95%)among intervention children but did not change greatly in thecontrol group (60% to 65%). Adverse outcomes declined significantly in the intervention group (half as many emergency room visits and two-thirds fewerdays in the hospital on average compared to the baseline year) butnot in the control group. Intervention group children had aclinically meaningful improvement in their quality-of-life scores(data not shown). Annual average health care charges declined $543 more per child in the intervention group than in the control group in theintervention year. Source: parent interviews and medical records (Kelly et al. 2000).

Each year, about 13,000 children and adolescents are diagnosed with type 1 diabetes, in which the bodydoes not produce insulin necessary to digest sugar and other food(LaPorte et al. 1995). An individual's ability to cope with achronic disease like diabetes influences the success of treatment(Lazarus and Fokman 1984). The physical, emotional, and socialdemands of intensive diabetes self-management\u2014which requiresmonitoring blood sugar, regulating diet and exercise, and makingmultiple insulin injections daily\u2014are especially challenging foradolescents given developmental changes and stresses (Grey et al.1999). As a result, adolescents with diabetes are at risk for poordisease control leading to hospitalizations and long-termcomplications, such as eye, kidney, and nerve damage. Intervention: In this study, all 77 participating adolescents (ages 12 to 20 years) received intensive diabetes team management,including monthly visits at a specialty clinic and telephonefollow-up. About half the teens were randomly selected toreceive coping skills training during four to eight weekly smallgroup sessions, followed by monthly booster sessions, toincrease their \"sense of competence and mastery by retraininginappropriate or non-constructive coping styles and formingmore positive styles and patterns of behavior\" (Grey et al. 2000).A nurse practitioner with experience in pediatric psychiatry anddiabetes led teens in role-playing to model and give feedback onappropriate behavior in various social situations identified asproblematic by youth, such as managing food choices withfriends, decision-making about drugs and alcohol, and handlingconflicts (Grey et al. 1999).Findings: Glycosylated hemoglobin A1c test results (which give a three-month average reading of blood sugar control) were nearlyidentical at the start of the study among youth selected to receivecoping skills training (intervention group) and those who did not(control group). One year after the start of the intervention: Average glycemic (blood sugar) control improved more in the intervention group than the control group (1.6 vs. 0.7percentage point reduction in hemoglobin A1c level). A onepercentage point reduction in this test is associated with a 15to 30 percent reduction in risk of developing long-termdiabetes complications (ADA 2002). Average quality of life impact score improved in the intervention group (13 percent lower perceived impact ofdiabetes) but worsened in the control group (9 percent higherimpact), such that the average score was 14 percent better forteens who received coping skills training than the controlgroup after one year. Source: ABCs of Diabetes Study (clinical data and youth self- reports), as reported by Grey et al. (1999; 2000); and personalcommunication with Margaret Grey (2003). Implications: Adding a behavioral intervention to intensive diabetes management improves disease control and quality oflife for adolescents. The Diabetes Complications and ControlTrial demonstrated a 50 percent lower risk of developing eyedisease after seven years among adolescents who reduced theiraverage hemoglobin A1c level to about 8 percent (DCCTResearch Group 1994).Leatherman and McCarthy, Quality of Health Care for Children and Adolescents: A Chartbook, 2004 .

Very low birthweight infants being cared for in neonatal intensive care units (NICU) are especiallyvulnerable to hospital-acquired (nosocomial) infections becauseof their immature immune systems and prolonged hospital stays(Harris 1997). Sepsis affects up to one of five very low birthweightinfants in the NICU and is associated with substantially higherdeath rates and longer hospital stays (Stoll et al. 2002). Thecoagulase-negative staphylococcus (CONS) bacterium is the mostfrequent cause of such infections. Intervention: Multidisciplinary teams from six NICUs engaged in a three-year collaborative process that included training on qualityimprovement, agreeing on common improvement goals andmetrics, reviewing performance data, and developing a list of\"potentially better practices\" for improvement (Horbar et al.2001). These practices were identified by sharing detailed analysesof care processes conducted by each site, reviewing the medicalliterature for evidence on prevention practices, and benchmarkingthe practices of participating sites and other superior performingNICUs through a series of site visits. Each NICU selected specificpractices for improvement that its team considered most relevant,in the following areas: handwashing, nutrition, skin care,diagnosis, respiratory care, vascular access (intravenous linemanagement), and organizational culture. Findings: Among six NICUs participating in the improvement collaborative, the average rate of hospital-acquired CONS infectionsin very low birthweight infants decreased by 5.4 percentage pointsin absolute terms from 1994 (before the intervention) to 1996(after the intervention). This change was significantly greater than a0.9 percentage point decrease in the average infection rate among66 comparison NICUs during this time. One year later (1997), theinfection rate at the six collaborative sites continued to decline, to alevel 9.7 percentage points lower than before the intervention,representing a 44 percent relative decrease since 1994. This changewas significantly different from the trend at comparison NICUs.Infection rates improved at four of the six intervention sites, whileworsening at the other two sites. During the project, treatment costs were reduced by $10,932 per infant among the six collaborating NICUs, representingaverage savings of $2.3 million in annual patient care costs perNICU. Treatment costs rose at comparison NICUs. With anaverage resource commitment of $68,206 per NICU, plus grant-funded support, the quality improvement produced $9 in savingsfor every $1 invested.

Chart 1:1 \u2014The National Survey of America's Families is a random-digit-dialing survey of households with telephones and an area probability sample ofhouseholds without telephones that provide national estimates for the civilian,noninstitutionalized population younger than age 65. Interviews for the 1999survey were conducted in English or Spanish between February and October1999 on behalf of the Urban Institute and Child Trends. Low-income families(under 200 percent of the federal poverty level) were oversampled. The 1999Child Public Use File included 35,938 children younger than 18 years sampledfrom 44,499 households. Up to two children were sampled per household: onechild age 5 or younger and one child ages 6 to 17 years. Information wasobtained from the adult (typically a parent) who was most knowledgeable aboutthe child. The 1999 response rate for child interviews was 81 percent. Child's agewas significantly associated with receipt of recommended well-child care inbivariate analysis (Yu et al. 2002; Safir et al. 2000). Chart 1:2 \u2014The National Immunization Survey (NIS) has been conducted annually since 1994 by the National Immunization Program and the NationalCenter for Health Statistics. The NIS provides national, state, and selected urbanarea estimates of vaccination coverage rates for U.S. children between the agesof 19 and 35 months at the time of the survey. The NIS combines two stages: 1)a random-digit-dialing telephone survey of nearly 1 million householdsconducted in English and Spanish (with interpreter services for other languages)to identify approximately 34,000 households with age-eligible children andobtain parent-reported vaccination histories based on written records wheneverpossible, and 2) a mail survey of all parent-identified child vaccinationproviders to validate the immunization record (the Provider Record CheckSurvey). Household and provider data are combined to produce provider-adjusted vaccination estimates. Provider vaccination record data was obtainedfor 21,317 children in 2002; the overall response rate for eligible householdswas 62 percent. Final estimates are weighted to represent all children ages 19 to35 months and adjusted to account for nonresponse and households without telephones (Zell et al. 2000; CDC 2003b).

A nationally representative sample of 2,017 parents (response rate68 percent) was interviewed from July 1995 to January 1996, including anoversample of African American and Hispanic households. One parent wasrandomly selected when two were present and one child was randomly selectedwhen the household had more than one child ages birth to 36 months. Analysisfor each topic was limited to parents of children between the ages for whichthat topic is recommended for discussion (N=170 parents of children youngerthan 3 months for newborn care, 1,645 parents of children ages 6 to 36 monthsfor discipline, 1,01 1 parents of children ages 18 to 36 months for toilet training,and 2,017 parents of children ages birth to 36 months for all other topics).Analyses were weighted to reflect the overall distribution of parents in the U.S.with children younger than 3 years (Schuster et al. 2000). Chart 1:4 \u2014The National Survey of Early Childhood Health is a telephone survey of a national random sample of 2,068 young children (ages 4 to 35 months), includingan oversample of Hispanic and black children. The parent or guardian who isprimarily responsible for the child's medical care was selected for the interview. Thesurvey was conducted in English and Spanish by the National Center for HealthStatistics between February and July 2000, as a module of the State and Local AreaIntegrated Telephone Survey, which uses the National Immunization Surveysampling frame (see description of Chart 1:2 above). Results are adjusted toaccount for nonresponse and households without telephones so as to reflect theentire U.S. population of children ages 4 to 35 months. Only parents of childrenages 4 to 9 months (N=432) were asked whether the child's doctors or other healthcare providers had talked with them since the child's birth about how the childcommunicates his/her needs. Only parents of children ages 10 to 18 months(N=674) and 19 to 35 months (N=962) were asked whether the child's doctors orother health care providers had talked with them in the last 12 months (or sincethe child's birth if the child was less than age 1 year) about words and phrases thatthe child uses and understands (Halfon et al. 2002; Blumberg et al. 2002).

Chart 2:2 \u2014This chart presents data describing medication mistakes among hospitalized children at two Boston teaching hospitals, detected by queryingand receiving voluntary reports from clinicians and by reviewing medicationorders, medication administration records, and medical records during sixweeks in 1999. At the first hospital, a freestanding children's hospital, the studyincluded randomly selected general medical, general surgical, and short-staywards and pediatric medical/surgical ICU. At the second hospital, which treatsboth adults and children, the study included all pediatric wards, includinggeneral medical/surgical wards, pediatric medical/surgical ICU, and neonatalICU. Data collectors were nurses, pharmacists, and physicians trained in anidentical manner. Two physicians reviewers independently classified suspectedand potential adverse drug events and rated the severity of any injury to thepatient. Medication errors were defined as errors in ordering, transcribing,dispensing, administering, or monitoring a drug, excepting rule violations withlittle potential for harm that are usually interpreted correctly by pharmacy andnursing staff. Adverse drug events were defined as injuries that result from useof a drug (Kaushal et al. 2001). Chart 2:3 \u2014The National Nosocomial Infections Surveillance (NNIS) System includes more than 300 participating hospitals that report data on certain Leatherman and McCarthy, Quality of Health Care for Children and Adolescents: A Chartbook, 2004 .

Accuracy of reporting is generally high (Emori et al.1998). Participating NNIS hospitals must have at least 100 beds and meetminimum requirements for infection control staffing; they are larger on averagebut have similar geographic distribution compared to U.S. hospitals generally(Richards et al. 2001). The number of participating hospitals has increased sincethe mid-1980s (Sartor et al. 1995). Data includes only those pediatric intensivecare units (PICUs) that reported at least 50 device- or patient-days (N=79 PICUswith 428,104 central line days 1995-2003;75 PICUs with 201,096 urinary catheter-days for urinary tract 285,607 ventilator-days for pneumonias during1995-2001). Ventilator-associated pneumonia was reported for January 1995 toJune 2001 (rather than for January 1995 to June 2003 as for other infections)because the NNIS began using new criteria to define nosocomial pneumonia inJanuary 2002 that would not be comparable to the 1986-1990 reference periodshown in the chart (NCID 2001; 2003). Chart 3:1 \u2014The Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS), sponsored by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), collects nationallyrepresentative data on health care use, expenditures, coverage, and quality forthe U.S. civilian, noninstitutionalized population. The household component isa subsample of participants in the prior year's National Health Interview Survey(see Chart 3:2). Data shown were collected using questions derived fromAHRQ's Consumer Assessment of Health Plans (CAHPS\u00ae) survey asked on theMEPS Parent Administered Questionnaire (PAQ), a mail-back survey of parentsof children ages 17 and younger. In 2000, the PAQ was completed by 6,577respondents representing 90 percent of those eligible for the PAQ and an overallresponse rate of 63 percent (AHRQ 2002b; www.meps.ahrq.gov). Chart 3:2 \u2014The National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) is an annual, nationally representative, multi-stage probability sample survey of the civilian,noninstitutionalized population of the U.S., conducted by the U.S. CensusBureau for the National Center for Health Statistics. Data on children arecollected through face-to-face interviews with adults familiar with the health ofone randomly selected child per family. In 2000, interviews were completed for13,376 children, representing 91 percent of the children eligible for the childsample and an overall response of 79 percent (Blackwell et al. 2003). Chart 3:3 \u2014The 1997 National Survey of America's Families sampled 28,867 children in more than 44,000 households, with a response rate 65 percent (seeChart 1:1 above for general information on this survey). \"Children were categorized as having unmet need if they had exceeded a cutoff point on amental health screening measure [the Mental Health Indicator] but had notreceived any mental health services in the past 12 months.\" The Mental HealthIndicator is a validated tool comprised of selected items from the ChildBehavior Checklist that \"best discriminated between demographically similarchildren who were or were not referred for mental health services, [and] is thusa measure of need for clinical mental health evaluation.\" A stringent cutoffpoint was set to \"avoid concerns about overinclusion of minor or transientsymptoms,\" resulting in specificity of 88 percent to 90 percent for each age-gender category. In both bivariate and multivariate analyses, Hispanic childrenhad significantly greater odds of unmet need compared to white children, andpublicly insured children had significantly lower odds of unmet need comparedto uninsured children. There were no significant differences in unmet need byage category (middle childhood vs. adolescence), by gender, by income (poorvs. not poor), between children of white race and those of black or other race,or between uninsured and privately insured children. Multivariate analysiscontrolled for predisposing sociodemographic factors, enabling resources, andchild's mental health status (Kataoka et al. 2002).

Chart 3:6 to 3:8 \u2014The National Survey of Children with Special Health Care Needs is sponsored by the federal Maternal and Child Health Bureau and conducted incooperation with the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS). Using theState and Local Area Integrated Telephone Survey (SLAITS) mechanism, arandom-digit-dialing sample of 196,888 households with children younger thanage 18 years in each of the 50 states and the District of Columbia was screenedfrom October 2000 to March 2002. Among these households, 38,866 interviewsLeatherman and McCarthy, Quality of Health Care for Children and Adolescents: A Chartbook, 2004 . The Commonwealth Fund 114ChildChartbook-Back-D3f.qxd 2/23/04 2:17 PM Page 114were completed (approximately 750 in each state) with a parent who was most knowledgeable about a child identified as having special health care needs. Onechild was randomly selected when there was more than one child with specialneeds in the same household. Children with special health care needs (CSHCN)were identified using the CSHCN Screening Tool, which asks whether the child:1) needs or uses more medical, mental health, or educational services than usualfor most children of the same age, 2) needs or uses prescribed medicine otherthan vitamins, 3) is limited in the ability to do things that most children of thesame age can do, 4) needs or gets special therapy, or 5) has any kind ofemotional, developmental, or behavioral problem needing treatment orcounseling. Two follow-up probes ask whether the need for services is because ofa medical, behavioral, or other health condition and whether the condition haslasted more than a year. The population at risk for developing special needs wasnot included because there is no currently accepted method for identifying suchchildren using a survey questionnaire (van Dyck et al. 2002). The weighted overallresponse rate for special needs interviews was 61 percent (Blumberg et al. 2003).Results shown in the charts were compiled by staff of the NCHS SpecialPopulation Surveys Branch (CDC 2003d), based on specifications that areforthcoming (McPherson et al. 2004). Chart 4:1 \u2014The 2000 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey and Parent Administered Questionnaire are described above for Chart 3:1. Chart 4:2 \u2014The Picker Institute's Pediatric Inpatient Survey was adapted from the Picker Adult Inpatient Survey and a quality of care survey developed byChildren's Hospital of Boston. Psychometric analysis indicates that theinstrument is reliable and has high correlation with overall satisfaction anddimension problem scores. Survey item responses were dichotomized as\"problems\" or \"not problems.\" Each survey question was mapped to one ofseven quality dimensions and a percentage of problem responses was calculatedfor each patient for each dimension. A problem score of 0 would mean noproblems were reported and 100 would mean problems were reported on 100percent of processes asked about in the survey. The overall problem score is anaverage of all the dimensions. Surveys were mailed to parents about two weeksafter their child was discharged from one of 38 participating hospitals(primarily academic and teaching institutions) for a nonsurgical condition thatdid not require intensive care, followed by reminders to nonrespondents.Completed surveys were received from 12,600 parents, representing 48 percentof the surveys mailed (Co et al. 2003).

In bivariate analysis, all independent variables shown in the chart weresignificantly associated with receipt of recommended well-child care. Inmultivariate analysis (after controlling for the child's health insurance, familyincome, race and ethnicity, health status, and parent's age and education),children who were uninsured or had poor health status or a parent with loweducational attainment had significantly greater odds of not receivingrecommended well-child visits. Children of Hispanic ethnicity or black race,covered by public insurance, or with a parent younger than 30 years, hadsignificantly lower odds of not receiving recommended well-child visits.Differences in well-child visits by family income were no longer significant inmultivariate analysis (Yu et al. 2002). Chart 5:2 \u2014The National Immunization Survey (NIS) is described above for Chart 1:2 (which describes 2002 data). For the 1994 NIS, 25,247 householdinterviews were completed from April to December and 7,594 provider surveyswere returned (41 percent of children eligible for provider follow-up) (CDC1995). For the 1998 NIS, 31,664 household interviews were completed and21,827 provider surveys were returned (67 percent of eligible children) (CDC1999b). The 95 percent confidence intervals of the rates did not overlap for anyof the comparisons shown on the chart for 1998 and 2002 (confidence intervalsnot available for 2004). Rates for rural areas (non-MSA) are not shown becausetheir confidence intervals overlapped with those of urban and/or suburbanareas. Data were not available in all years for other racial groups, which are notshown. The category \"unknown poverty\" was omitted for clarity. (Seewww.cdc.gov/nis for NIS data tables.) Chart 5:3 \u2014The Asthma Care Quality Assessment Project involved five large health plans: three group model HMOs serving employer- and Medicaid-insured populations and two mixed-model Medicaid managed careorganizations. Medicaid-insured children (ages 2 to 16 years) were included ifcomputerized data indicated a physician diagnosis for asthma or aprescription for an asthma medication and a parent confirmed that the childhad physician-diagnosed asthma (all eligible children were identified in fourplans and a random sample was drawn in one large plan). A total of 1,658interviews with parents were completed in English or Spanish during 1999and included in the analysis (63 percent of those eligible).

The Commonwealth Fund 115ChildChartbook-Back-D3f.qxd 2/23/04 2:17 PM Page 115questions were based on previously validated instruments. Persistent asthma was defined as having five or more symptom days in past two weeks, usingbeta-agonist medications three or more times per week in the past two weeks,or using anti-inflammatory medications daily in the past two weeks.Compared to white children (31 percent of the sample), black children (38percent of the sample) had worse asthma status, and Latino children (19percent of the sample) missed more school days. In multivariate analyses thatcontrolled for sociodemographic variables and asthma status, minoritychildren had significantly lower odds of using inhaled anti-inflammatorymedication in comparison to white children, while process of care measureswere equal or better for minority children (Lieu et al. 2002). Chart 5:4 \u2014The help-seeking analysis shown in this chart is derived from the first stage of a two-stage study. A gender-stratified random sample of 3,158 children(limited to one child per household) was drawn from children in kindergartenthrough fifth grade in one north central Florida school district who lived in ahousehold with a telephone, were not receiving special education services formental retardation or autism, and were white (reported as \"Caucasian\") orAfrican American (other minorities made up less than five percent of thestudent population). Parents of 1,615 children were contacted and agreed toparticipate in a telephone interview between October and December 1998.Mailed teacher questionnaires were completed with parent permission for1,197 children. A total of 389 children were included in the help-seekinganalysis if they had been diagnosed or treated for ADHD or scored two standarddeviations above the norm by parent or teacher rating on a standardizedscreening measure, the SNAP IV. Estimates were adjusted for sampling andnonparticipation effects. All gender and racial differences in parent recognitionand help-seeking were significant in bivariate analysis. Gender and racialdifferences in help-seeking remained significant in multivariate analyses aftercontrolling for predisposing sociodemographic factors, enabling factors, andneed for services. However, there were no significant differences by gender orrace for parents' recognition of behavioral problems after controlling for thesefactors (Bussing et al. 2003). Chart 5:5 \u2014The National Survey of Children with Special Health Care Needs is described above for Charts 3:6 to 3:8. Chart 5:6 \u2014The Consumer Assessment of Health Plans Benchmarking Database 1.0 included 9,540 children (younger than age 18 years) enrolled in Medicaidmanaged care plans in Arkansas, Kansas, Minnesota, Oklahoma, Vermont, andWashington State in 1997 and 1998. Surveys were administered in English and Spanish by phone and mail with a 42 percent average response rate. Languagefor Hispanic and Asian parents was based on what she/he reported primarilyspeaking at home. Data for missing race and language and other race wereomitted from the chart for clarity. The chart presents composite scores for threeof five performance domains measured by the survey (see Charts 3:1 and 4:1 forexamples of items included in these domains). After controlling for parent age,gender, and education and child's health status, ratings given by AfricanAmericans, American Indians, and non-English-speaking Hispanic and Asianparents were significantly different from ratings given by white parents for mostdomains shown on the chart, except for \"Provider Communication\" amongAfrican Americans and \"Getting Needed Care\" among Hispanic Spanish-speaking parents. Ratings given by English-speaking Hispanic and Asian parentswere not significantly different from ratings given by white parents (Weech-Maldonado et al. 2001). Chart 6:1 \u2014This before-and-after study included all physician practices in Durham, N.C., that enrolled at least five patients per month: two familypractice group practices, three pediatric group practices, an HMO pediatricclinic, a university medical center, and a federally qualified community healthcenter. A random sample of 40 medical records was abstracted at each practiceat baseline (N=339) and separate follow-up samples were abstracted 12months after each practice's office systems were operational. The follow-upsamples consisted of 35 charts from each of three age groups at each practice:12 to 18 months (N=289), 19 to 24 months (N=285), and 25 to 30 months(N=300). All rates of preventive services shown in the chart were significantlydifferent at follow-up from rates at baseline. Longer time of exposure to theintervention was associated with a significant trend toward increased rates ofpreventive care. Logistic models accounted for clustering of patients withinpractices (Bordley et al. 2001). Chart 6:2 \u2014This prospective controlled trial was conducted at 15 pediatric practice sites located in 14 states with enrollment staggered between Sept.1996 through Nov. 1998. Newborns up to 4 weeks old were consecutivelyenrolled at birth or at their first office visit if they were not to be adopted orplaced in foster care, were not too ill to make an office visit by age 4 weeks,their mother spoke English or Spanish, and the family intended to continue atthe practice for at least 6 months. At each of six sites, 400 newborns wererandomized to intervention or control groups (the same clinicians cared forchildren in both groups). At each of nine sites, about 200 newborns wereLeatherman and McCarthy, Quality of Health Care for Children and Adolescents: A Chartbook, 2004 .

Data was obtained from telephone interviews in English and Spanish when thechild was 30 to 33 months (N=3,737 primarily mothers, representing 67percent of 5,565 enrolled families), enrollment forms, and a random sampleof medical records at each practice. In bivariate analyses of results from all sitescombined, 21 of 24 quality of care outcomes measured in the study (only fiveof which are shown in the chart) were significantly improved for theintervention versus control group and comparison sites. These results wereconfirmed in multivariate analysis that controlled for site of enrollment andcharacteristics of the child, parent, and family, for the fact that families withinsites tend to respond more similarly than those at different sites, and fornonrandom assignment at quasi-experimental sites or selective reporting ofoutcome data (Minkovitz et al. 2003). Chart 6:3 \u2014This chart compares two separate retrospective data analyses. Rhode Island data were derived from a random sample of 2,000 children ages 19 to 35months as of June 30, 1997, who were continuously enrolled (with no morethan a 30-day gap) in the Rhode Island Medicaid managed care program fromJuly 1996 through June 1997. Data on lead screening performed from birth toJune 30, 1997, were available from the medical records of the primary careprovider(s) for 1,988 of such children (Vivier et al. 2001). Comparison datawere derived from Medicaid claims for 15 states that submitted complete 1994and 1995 data to the federal government's State Medicaid Research Files. Theanalysis was limited to young children who had an opportunity to receive ablood lead test paid for directly by Medicaid (N=288,963), specifically thosethat: 1) were enrolled in Medicaid for six months before and after their first orsecond birthday; 2) had their first or second birthday between July 1994 andJune 1995; 3) had made at least one visit to a Medicaid provider; 4) had noevidence of ever being enrolled in Medicaid managed care; and 5) had noevidence of coverage by private health insurance before 19 months for one-yearolds and 31 months for two-year-olds (GAO 1999). Chart 6:4 \u2014In this before-and-after study, five community and migrant health centers (CMHCs) were selected for study participation based on diversity ofgeography, patient population, and clinician types; adequacy of informationinfrastructure; and stability and commitment of leadership. Data shown in thechart were derived from telephone interviews conducted by research staff withtwo independent samples of adolescent patients (ages 14 to 19 years) at pre-intervention (N=260) and nine to 15 months post-intervention (N=274).Adolescents and their parents seen at clinic visits were consented and enrolledby clinic staff. Interviews, conducted two to four weeks after clinic visits, assessed whether adolescents recalled receiving each of 31 recommendedcounseling, screening, examination, or laboratory services. Differences in ratesof screening (before versus after the intervention) were significant for all topicsshown in the chart (Klein et al. 2001). Chart 6:5 \u2014In this cluster-randomized controlled trial, the 10 largest pediatric clinics affiliated with a large HMO were selected for participation from thosethat were willing, had no adolescent-specific clinic, had a minimum of 500sexually active adolescent girls (ages 14 to 18 years) visiting for routinecheckups each year, and served an ethnically diverse population. Sites wererandomly assigned to intervention or usual care; site staff were blinded to studyconditions and assignment. Screening rates were determined using a patientencounter and laboratory database. Site-specific sexual activity rates weredetermined using an anonymous survey administered after routine checkupvisits. Among adolescent girls ages 14 to 18 years who had 7,920 routinecheckup visits during the April 2000 through March 2002 study period, 1,017and 1,194 were estimated to be eligible for screening in the intervention andcontrol sites, respectively. Estimated screening rates were calculated (number ofchlamydia tests done divided by the product of the number of girls seen forcheckups and the sexual activity rate) at baseline and six consecutive three-month periods during the intervention (only baseline and final rates are shownin the chart). The screening rate was significantly higher in the interventionclinics than in control clinics by the four- to six-month period after the start ofthe intervention and remained so throughout most of the post-interventionperiod. A statistical test (repeated measures analysis of variance) of time periodby study group interaction effect found that the change in screening ratesdiffered significantly for the intervention and control sites (Shafer et al. 2002). Chart 6:6 \u2014In this cluster-randomized controlled trial, 12 clinical practices affiliated with two managed care organizations were stratified by size andrandomly assigned (by pairs based on similar ranked baseline antibioticprescribing rates) to intervention or control groups. Computerized claims datawere analyzed for enrolled children ages 3 months up to 72 months if they hadpharmacy benefits for at least three months during the study period and had arecord of ambulatory visits and antimicrobial prescribing during the studyperiod. There were 14,468 and 13,460 patients in the baseline and interventionyears, respectively. Observation time in person-years was determined for eachchild as the period of membership in the age subgroup (based on age at thestart of the intervention year) during the baseline and intervention years.

The Commonwealth Fund 117ChildChartbook-Back-D3f.qxd 2/23/04 2:17 PM Page 117Baseline antibiotic use was significantly lower in the intervention sites. The change in unadjusted dispensing rates (shown in the chart) was significantlygreater for intervention versus control sites. In a comparison of rates for 8,815children enrolled during both years of observation (not shown), a significantintervention effect was confirmed after adjusting for each patient's antibiotic usein the baseline year, their age, and correlation between prescription rates forchildren in each practice site. This effect was confirmed in separate practice-levelanalyses, which found that the improvement was not attributable to extremeresults at any one practice site (Finkelstein et al. 2001). Chart 6:7 \u2014Participants in this controlled before-and-after study included Medicaid-insured children and adolescents, ages 2 to 16 years, who had visitedan inner-city hospital emergency room two or more times or been hospitalizedone or more times for asthma in the past year, had received primary care in thehospital's outpatient clinic, had not been evaluated by an asthma specialist inthe past two years, and whose family consented to participate. Participants werealternately assigned to intervention or control groups (the family andinterviewer were not aware of group assignment at recruitment), which weredemographically similar at baseline. Most children continued to receive themajority of their care from the hospital's outpatient clinic during theintervention. Utilization data were collected through monthly telephoneinterviews with parents of children and verified by comparison to medicalrecords. Data were obtained from hospital financial records on charges foroutpatient medical care of study patients; charges for hospitalizations and ERvisits that occurred in other institutions were imputed based on the studyhospital's average charges. The cost of the outreach nurse (12 hours per week or$15,000/year) was included in the cost of the intervention. In logistic regressionanalysis controlling for individual history of asthma outcomes in the prior year,children in the control group were significantly more likely than those in theintervention group to have an ED visit and to be hospitalized for asthma in thestudy year (Kelly et al. 2000). Chart 6:8 \u2014Adolescent patients (ages 12 to 20 years) attending a university- affiliated diabetes clinic were invited to participate in this randomizedcontrolled trial if they had no other health problems except for treatedhypothyroidism, had been taking insulin for at least one year, had recenthemoglobin A1c between 7 percent and 14 percent, had no severehypoglycemic events in the past six months, and were in school gradeappropriate to their age within one year. Between November 1, 1995, andDecember 1, 1997, 77 of 105 invited patients agreed to participate and were randomly assigned to control or intervention groups; there were no significantdifferences between participants and non-participants or between control andintervention groups on measured variables at baseline. Diabetes care providersand data collectors were blinded to study group assignment. Analysis ofvariance for repeated measures and simple post hoc contrast tests found thataverage hemoglobin A1c levels and quality-of-life scores (measured using theDiabetes Quality of Life: Youth instrument) improved significantly more overtime and were significantly different at six months and 12 months for theintervention group compared to the control group (Grey et al. 2000). Chart 6:9 \u2014This comparative before-and-after study involved six self-selected members of the Vermont Oxford Network, a voluntary group of professionalscommitted to research, education, and quality improvement. Data on projectoutcomes were derived from the Network's database of standardizedinformation on infants weighing 401 to 1,500 grams at birth who were born ator transferred to participating NICUs within 28 days of birth. Nosocomialinfection was defined as the occurrence, after the third day of life, of aninfection from a predefined list of bacterial pathogens. \"Coagulase-negativestaphylococcal infection [CONS] required the recovery of the organism fromblood or spinal fluid, signs of systemic illness, and treatment for 5 or more daysantibiotics.\" The comparison group included 66 North American NICUs thatcontributed 25 or more cases to the Network database from 1994 to 1996 andwere not participating in the intervention. Primary analyses compared changein average CONS infection rates from baseline (1994) to a predefined end-point(1996) with additional comparisons to 1997. The study included infantsweighing 501 to 1,500 grams who were hospitalized more than three days atintervention sites (N=745 born in 1994, 772 born in 1996, and 789 born in1997) and at comparison sites (5,108 born in 1994, 5,528 born in 1996, and5,572 born in 1997). Significant differences in magnitude of change in averageCONS infection rates at intervention and comparison sites (group-by-yearinteraction) were found using a logistic regression model that controlled forbirth weight, location of birth, multiple birth, assisted ventilation, and year ofbirth. Secondary analysis (based on variable, year of birth) found a significantchange in outcome over time among intervention NICUs from 1994 to 1997.There was also a significant decline in the average rate of all measurednosocomial infections at the intervention sites during this time, attributable tothe decline in CONS infections (Horbar et al. 2001).Leatherman and McCarthy, Quality of Health Care for Children and Adolescents: A Chartbook, 2004 .
