The Year of Sport promotes Can-ada's position as a leading sport nation. \"The Year of Sport in Canada is a proactive pan-Canadian initiative to celebrate the role that sport plays in our country and encourage Can-adians to participate in and seek the benefits of sport. During the year, sport events and other cele - bratory activities will highlight how sport benefits Canadians.\" More than 60 international sporting events were hosted in Canada including: l 2015 World Junior Hockey Championships l Canada Winter Games l Ford Men' s World Curling Championships l FIF A Women's World Cup l T oronto 2015 Pan and Parapan American Games The field of chiropractic sports sciences has undergone tremendous growth both in Canada and internationally and the Royal College of Chiropractic Sports Sciences (Canada) (RCCSS(C)) and its Fellows have been a ma-jor source of this growth. The ability of the RCCSS(C) to foster an academic environment where Fellows and residents are encouraged to conduct research and publish their findings has helped lead to increased acceptance of chiropractic at all levels of sport including major sporting events and Games along with greater understanding of sports injuries, their diagnosis, and management. Simi-larly the international sports chiropractic community has seen unprecedented growth in terms of both scholarship and participation at major international sports events. To help continue this growth, the Journal of the Canadian Chiropractic Association (JCCA) is publishing its 7 th an- nual Sports Chiropractic Issue in December 2015. As I mentioned in my previous editorials, there has been a paucity of research in Sports Chiropractic, which drove us to start the JCCA Sports Issue 7 years ago to provide a global stage for Sports Chiropractic research publications. Many Sports Chiropractors and researchers in this field agree with me that it is time for us to step up in our research activities and take the lead in this area. To do so we need to to identify the priorities for our fu-ture research and establish a Sports Chiropractic research agenda.

La plupart Schneider Introduction Evidence-based practice (EBP) refers to 'the conscien - tious, explicit, and judicious use of current best evidence in making decisions about the care of individual pa-tients' 1. Essentially, EBP involves the integration of three key components: 1) the use of the best available research evidence, 2) knowledge arising from one's clinical exper - tise/clinical reasoning, and 3) patients' preferences and values. 1 Evidence-based practice is associated with improved clinical decision-making and patient care.2,3 Since the establishment of evidence-based medicine at McMaster University in the 1980s, EBP principles have been em-braced in other health disciplines, including nursing 4,5, oc- cupational therapy and physical therapy.6 Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) professionals, including Doctors of Chiropractic (DC), are increasingly expected to use EBP principles to guide clinical decision making. 7 A number of indicators suggest a possible shift toward the adoption of EBP in chiropractic, including the rela - tively recent creation of evidence-based clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) in chiropractic 8-12, EBP educational programs13-16, and the adoption of an 'Evidence-Informed Practice statement' by nine out of ten Canadian provincial associations and eight of ten provincial regulatory boards (status pending in three organizations). (www.chiroguide - lines.org). The statement reads as follows: \"Canadian chiropractors adopt evidence-informed practice principles to guide clinical decision mak-ing by integrating their clinical expertise, patient's preferences and values, and the best available sci-entific evidence.\"attitudes toward EBP . Over half indicated a high level of self-reported skills in EBP , and over 90% expressed an interest in improving these skills. A majority of respondents (65%) reported over half of their practice was based on evidence from clinical research, and only half (52%) agreed that chiropractic CPGs significantly impacted on their practice. Conclusions: While most Canadian chiropractors held positive attitudes towards EBP , believed EBP was useful, and were interested in improving their skills in EBP , many did not use research evidence or CPGs to guide clinical decision making. Our findings should be interpreted cautiously due to the low response rate. (JCCA. 2015; 59(4): et plus de 90 % d'entre eux ont fait part de leur int\u00e9r\u00eat \u00e0 am\u00e9liorer ces comp\u00e9tences.

Despite the growing awareness of EBP in the chiroprac-tic profession, there still remains a large gap between the appreciation of EBP and the actual application of EBP. 17 The challenges in reducing the research-practice gap have not been restricted to certain health conditions, health professions, context (primary vs. specialized care) or settings (developed vs. underdeveloped countries). 18-20 A landmark report, 'Bridging the quality chasm', pub-lished by the Institute of Medicine in the early 1990's drew attention to the gap between 'what we know' and 'what we do'. 21 The nature of the problem is described as one of overuse, misuse and underuse of health care servi-ces. In essence, the health care delivery system has fallen far short in its ability to translate research into practice and policy, and to apply new technology safely and ap-propriately. 21 A major implication from this observation is that patients do not always receive safe and effective healthcare. Understanding how EBP is perceived and implemented across health disciplines can identify educational needs and outcomes, and predict where new research evidence is more likely to be implemented. 22 This is accomplished by examining healthcare providers' knowledge, attitudes, and application of EBP, as well as practitioners' EBP be-haviours in the clinical setting. 23 Significant predictors of self-reported use of research evidence among physical and occupational therapists, mental health care providers and dietitians include fac-tors such as educational degree or academic qualifica-tion, involvement in research or EBP-related activities, and practitioners' perceptions, attitudes and beliefs about research and EBP. 17 Previous surveys and interviews of chiropractors in Australia, USA, Germany and the UK generally report favorable attitudes toward EBP 24-27, with respondents indicating that research is important in es-tablishing chiropractic as a legitimate profession 26,27. However, in spite of their favorable inclination towards EBP, many respondents did not use CPGs or research evidence to guide clinical decision making. 24,25,28 Lack of time, lack of clinical evidence in CAM, and lack of incentive to participate in EBP were the most commonly reported barriers to practicing EBP. Learning needs ap-peared to vary according to the type of profession, years in practice, and prior research experience. 29 Further, accessibility to research, insufficient skills for locating, interpreting, critically appraising, and applying research findings to clinical practice were poor amongst chiro-practors and other CAM providers. 25,29-31 However, given the small and specialized samples in these studies, the generalizability of these findings is somewhat limited. Consequently, the factors associated with the uptake of EBP by the chiropractic profession in Canada still remain poorly understood. The primary objective of this study was to investigate Canadian chiropractors' attitudes, skills and use of re-search evidence in clinical practice, and to identify the barriers to and facilitators of EBP uptake. A secondary objective was to explore the level of awareness and agree-ment with three chiropractic clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) published in the last decade on the management of adult neck pain 32, whiplash-associated disorders10 and headaches33. Methods Study Design & Setting This descriptive cross-sectional survey was conducted online between December 13, 2013 and June 5, 2014. The survey was administered electronically through the University of Pittsburgh (U Pitt), Pennsylvania, using the U Pitt web platform. Context This study replicates the first phase of a federally-fund - ed study of DCs in the United-States (R21 AT007547-01: Distance Education Online Intervention for Evi-dence-Based Practice Literacy [DELIVER]), which was designed to evaluate the effectiveness of an online EBP educational program on chiropractor attitudes, skills, and use of EBP. 34 The first phase of the DELIVER study was an online EBP survey of US chiropractors, which provid-ed an opportunity to contrast the attitudes, skills, and use of research evidence between chiropractors. Participants & Recruitment The survey was open to all practicing Doctors of Chiro-practic in Canada who had internet access and a valid email address and were members of the Canadian Chiro-practic Association (CCA). A convenience sample of DCs Assoc Stuber, R Evans, MJ Schneider was recruited from a potential pool of 7,200 DCs, with the support of the CCA and all ten provincial chiropractic associations. The above mentioned organizations provided email-forwarding services through their respective mem-bership lists. The forwarded email and follow-up emails described a unique opportunity to participate in an online survey. Preliminary notification of the study and pub-lished advertisements in a national chiropractic publica - tion (The Journal of the Canadian Chiropractic Associ-ation) and quarterly newsletters of the CCA and provin-cial associations (December 2013) provided an overview of the study and invited readers to participate in the online survey. Questionnaire and Outcomes The Evidence-Based practice Attitude and utilization Sur - vEy (EBASE) is a self-administered multi-dimensional instrument designed to measure CAM providers' attitudes, skills and use of EBP. 35 The instrument has demonstrat- ed good internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha = 0.84), content validity (CVI = 0.899), and acceptable test-retest reliability (ICC = 0.578-0.986). 35,36 Minor modification of the EBASE was required to ensure the language was appropriate for use with American 34 and Canadian chiro- practors. These changes were made in consultation with the survey developer (ML) and recent administrator of the survey (MS) to ensure the structure and intent of the modi-fied questions did not alter the validity of the original sur - vey. Some additional questions were added to the online survey in order to explore DCs' awareness of Canadian chiropractic clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) released in the past decade. The demographics section of the sur - vey was revised to ensure it was relevant to the Canadian chiropractor population. Modifications to the demograph-ics section did not affect the internal validity of the other parts of the EBASE, which were not modified. The modi-fied-EBASE was then translated into French using a for - ward-backward translation approach. The modified version of the EBASE contained 76 items and was divided into seven parts (Parts A-G); Parts A-F each address a different EBP construct (i.e. Attitudes, skill, use, training & education, barriers, and facilitators), and Part G contains demographic items only. Three parts of the EBASE generate sub-scores: Parts A (Attitudes), B (Skill), and D (Use). The survey was accompanied by an additional 12 items that examined participant awareness of prior chiropractic guidelines. The completion time of the online EBASE was approximately 20 minutes (see additional file 1 for a copy of the modified-EBASE and the scoring rubric for calculating the three sub-scores). Survey Administration & Data Collection DCs interested in participating in the survey were in-vited to follow a link to the UPitt website (http://www.chirostudy.pitt.edu), where they could obtain detailed in-formation about the study procedures and register for the study by submitting an email address. Participants were subsequently emailed a password in order to enter the sur - vey site; an effort aimed at preventing multiple responses from the same individual. To encourage honest and trans-parent responses, anonymity was insured by assigning a unique identification number to each registered DC, which was used to identify the individual's survey data. As participants completed the survey in the language of their choice, responses were captured through a secure data capturing feature/system, Web Data Xpress, an inter - face used by UPitt that allows for direct entry and storage of data within a designated SQL Server database (http://www.wpic.pitt.edu/research/wdx/). This method of data capture is resource-efficient and minimizes human error by avoiding the need for manual data entry. Data Analysis Data were analyzed using SPSS version 22 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). Descriptive statistics were calculat - ed for each item in Parts A, B, D, E, F and G (response frequencies and means), Part C and the additional items on the awareness of CPGs (response frequencies). The at-titudes, skills, and use sub-scores were calculated using the scoring rubric (see additional file 1) developed for the original EBASE. This involves summing the first eight items of Part A (response range 1-5; total score range of 8-40), all 13 items of Part B (response range 1-5; total score range of 13-65), and the first 6 items of Part D (re-sponse range 0-4; total score range of 0-24). Frequency distributions for the group sub-score means for Parts A, B and D were also calculated. Higher sub-scores indicate higher self-reported attitude (Part A), skill level (Part B) and use (Part D) of EBP. We also explored possible asso-ciations between certain demographic variables and the attitudes, skills and use sub-scores.336 J Can Chiropr Assoc 2015; 59(4)Self-reported attitudes, skills and use of evidence-based practice among Canadian doctors of chiropractic: a national survey Table 1.

Informed consent was obtained from all subjects via the homepage of the study website, prior to participation in the survey. ResultsParticipant Characteristics DemographicsA total of 554 Canadian chiropractors responded to the survey, providing a response rate of approximately 8%. The sample was predominantly male (65.5%) with a mean age of 42 (SD 11.4) years (Table 1). The majority of respondents practiced in urban (60.8%) or suburban settings (24.7%), saw on average fewer than 30 patients daily (74%), and indicated that the main focus of their practice was musculoskeletal care (66.5%). The mean number of years in practice was 15.8 years (range: 1 to 49 years). Self-reported use of radiography Less than a quarter of the participants (23.8%) indicated they had access to onsite radiography, and a large major - ity (77.3%) reported that 25% or fewer of their patients undergo spine radiographs each week (either in their clinic or at imaging centers). Nonetheless, over 20% of respondents agreed or strongly agreed that x-rays of the lumbar spine are useful in the diagnostic work up of pa-tients with acute (< 1 month) low back pain, and a further 22.7% indicated that they neither agreed nor disagreed (i.e., felt neutral) with this statement (Table 1). Attitudes toward EBP Participants generally held favorable attitudes (Part A) toward EBP, with a mean attitudes sub-score of 32 (5.5), (range 10-40); while the median (IQR) sub-score 33.0 (7.0) was close to the mean (Fig 1). The majority (>75%) of participants \"agreed\" or \"strongly agreed\" with the at-titudinal statements on EBP (Table 2). A smaller propor - tion of the respondents agreed with statements: 1) \"EBP takes into account a patient's preference for (47.4% agree/strongly agree); and 2) \"EBP takes into ac-count experience when making clinical deci - sions\" (70.7% agree/strongly agree).

Skills in EBP For self-reported skills in EBP (Part B), the mean and median (IQR) sub-score were respectively 42.9 (8.9), (range 19-65) and 43.0 (12.0) (Fig 2). For the majority of the skill items, more than half of respondents indicated a high level ('4' or '5') of self-reported skill in EBP (Table 3); Nonetheless, nearly a third of respondents rated their skills in the mid-range ('3' on a 1-5 scale) for 11 of the 13 skill items. Two items were rated as having poor self-re-ported skills: 1) \"conducting clinical research\" (73.7% of respondents), and systematic reviews\" (59.2% of respondents). Level of EBP training/education One third or less of respondents indicated that the follow-ing topics were major parts of their chiropractic educa - tion: coursework about EBP (34.7%), applying research evidence to clinical practice (28.1%), and critical think-ing/analysis (27.8%) (Table 4). Ten percent of the sample indicated they never had any training in critical thinking/analysis included in their chiropractic education.

Nearly two thirds of the sample (64.7%) indicated that over half of their practice was based on evidence from clinical re-search. Nonetheless, 34% did not use an online database to search for practice-based literature or research findings, and 24.8% reported not using professional literature or re-search findings to change their clinical practice (Table 5). Barriers and Facilitators to EBP Uptake Participants perceived the following factors to be mod-erate or major barriers to EBP uptake in clinical practice (Part E): 1) lack of clinical evidence about CAM (44.1%); 2) lack of time (40.8%); and 3) lack of industry support (e.g., professional organizations) (31.2%) (Table 6). Approximately one quarter of respondents cited lack of incentive (23.2%) and insufficient skills to critically ap-praise (24.1%) and to interpret research (24.1%) as being moderate or major barriers to EBP uptake. Conversely , over 70% of respondents indicated all 10 facilitator items were either \"moderately useful\" or \"very useful\" in facilitating the uptake of EBP (Part F) (Table 7). Items most frequently reported as \"very use-ful\" were: access to online education materials related to evidence-based practice (92.5%), access to the internet (92.2%), access to free online databases (87.3%), and ac-Table 5.

In contrast, items most frequent - ly reported as \"not useful\" or \"slightly useful\" related to the access to tools to assist clinicians in conducting their own critical appraisal of the research evidence (26%), and for evaluating single (28%) or multiple research papers (32.1%). Awareness of past clinical practice guidelines Table 8 presents respondents' levels of awareness and agreement with three chiropractic clinical practice guide-lines (CPGs) developed by the Canadian Chiropractic Association and the Federation. All respondents were aware of the three CPGs published between 2005 and 2011, and a large majority (over 80%) indicated that they were familiar or very familiar with most of the recom-mendations issued in these CPGs. Although over 70% of participants felt that the guidelines were representative of the best available evidence, only half of the respondents (51.7%) agreed or strongly agreed that these guidelines had significantly impacted on how they managed their patients. Associations between demographic variables and Attitude, Skills and Use Sub-scores.DCs with a musculoskeletal focus had a more favorable attitude toward EBP (r =.406, p < .001) and a higher level of skill in EBP (r =.153, p < .001) relative to those with a non-musculoskeletal focus. Similarly, as education level increased (i.e. from associate degree, to MSc and PhD), attitudes (r =.191, p < .001), skills (r =.296, p < .001), and use (r =.146, p = .001) sub-scores increased. In contrast, DC's who reported a busier practice had a less favorable attitude toward EBP (r = -.297, p < .001) and lower level of skill in EBP (r = -.150, p < .001) than those who saw fewer than 20 patients per day. DCs who reported having onsite imaging equipment had less favorable attitudes (r = -.235, p < .001) and lower EBP skills (r = -.118, p = .005) than their counterparts. Furthermore, DC's who reported ordering more radiog-raphy had lower attitude sub-scores (r = -.292, p < .001). Table 8.

DiscussionSummary of findings Understanding chiropractors' attitudes, skills and use of EBP and the potential barriers and facilitators of EBP use is a critical step in advancing EBP and increasing the uptake of research into chiropractic clinical practice. Our results suggest that Canadian chiropractors generally have moderate to strong positive attitudes about EBP and report moderate to high level skills in acquiring research evidence, but that much improvement can be made in the application of research evidence in clinical practice. These results are in line with those reported by Suter 30 among DCs and massage therapists in Canada; although, that sample was restricted to one province (Alberta) and did not use a standardized questionnaire. While attitudes toward EBP were generally favorable in our sample, misconceptions regarding the importance of integrating the three pillars of EBP to guide clinical decision making (i.e. use of the best evidence, clinic-al expertise, and patient's preferences and values) 1 ap- pear to persist. A large proportion of survey respondents (between 30% and 50%) were unsure or disagreed that EBP takes into account clinical experience and patient preference. These results are not surprising given that approximately half (44%) of our sample received their chiropractic training greater than 15 years ago, with many of our participants reporting no, minimal, or minor chiro-practic foundational training in EBP (Table 2). Also, con-trasting beliefs and approaches in chiropractic (experien - tial vs. EBP) are well documented and remain a source of ongoing debate in the profession. 37-40 While chiropractors seem to recognize the 'push' towards EBP, and a growing segment of the profession appear to embrace its principles with nearly 90% of participants interested in learning or improving their EBP skills, uptake of scientific evidence is slow. 41 Gaining a better understanding of chiropractors' clinical experiences, beliefs and apparent dissonance with research evidence may help to improve the translation of research into practice as well as patient care. 42 Between 50% and 70% of the sample reported a high level of skill in EBP, particularly in relation to identify - ing answerable clinical questions, identifying knowledge gaps in practice, and literature searching. However, near - ly one third of respondents rated themselves only in the mid-range on nearly all of the EBP skill items. Important - ly, 40% reported poor to moderate skills in using the find-ings from systematic reviews, which is a common finding among many health professions. 43 This is worthy of atten - tion given the value of systematic reviews to provide effi-cient access to potentially large volumes of research data through the synthesis of primary research studies using systematic, explicit and reproducible methods. 44 As such, well-conducted systematic reviews have replaced ran-domized controlled trials as the gold standard of evidence and further, are presented in a format that can facilitate the use of the best available evidence by both students and practitioners. Over one-third of respondents estimated that only a small or very small percentage of their practice was based on clinical research evidence. Furthermore, over half re-ported never or rarely using an online database to search for practice-based literature or research, professional lit-erature and research findings to change their clinical prac-tice, or consulting a colleague or industry expert to assist their clinical decision making. Such findings are trouble - some and likely result in important knowledge-practice discrepancies in chiropractic. Important gaps have also been identified in other health disciplines, with nearly 30-40% of medical patients not receiving optimal care, and a further 20-25% receiving care that is unnecessary or potentially harmful. 45,46 While robust estimates of know- ledge-practice gaps in chiropractic are lacking, we pos-tulate that it is unlikely to be any better considering our findings. Further, cultural shifts are often slow and require concerted efforts from professional leaders to move re-search agendas forward and to accelerate the uptake and application of EBP to improve patient health outcomes. 39 Exploratory analyses suggest that DCs with a main focus on non-musculoskeletal care, reporting busier practices and with lower levels of education demonstrat - ed poorer attitudes and lower skill levels with respect to EBP. These findings are consistent with a recent US study that found provider and practice characteristics influence chiropractic practice behaviour. 34 Further, poorer attitudes toward, skill levels in, and utilisation of EBP were asso-ciated with beliefs that lumbar spine x-ray is useful for 344 J Can Chiropr Assoc 2015; 59(4)Self-reported attitudes, skills and use of evidence-based practice among Canadian doctors of chiropractic: a national survey diagnosing patients with acute LBP, a practice inconsis- tent with the best available evidence.47 While educational interventions may be effective in improving professional practice 48 and possibly reducing the perceived need for plain radiography in acute LBP among chiropractors49, more active strategies will likely be required to change professional behaviours 20,50. In the current study, a majority of respondents (77%) reported that 25% or fewer of their patients undergo spine radiographs each week. This is in line with figures from a national survey of Canadian DCs suggesting that the percentage of chiropractic patients who are x-rayed at least once per episode has gradually declined from 48% in 1997 to 35% in 2011. 51 Furthermore, our data indicate that about 20% of respondents agreed or strongly agreed that x-rays of the lumbar spine are useful in the diagnostic work up of patients with acute (< 1 month) low back pain. This represents an important reduction from about half of respondents in an Ontario study a decade ago who agreed or strongly agreed with this same statement. 49 Such a downward trend has been observed over the past two dec-ades among chiropractors in North America 52-56, UK57 and Switzerland58. Barriers to applying research findings in practice are numerous.19,59,60 For Canadian DCs, the key barriers to EBP uptake were a lack of clinical evidence about CAM, a lack of time and incentive, and a lack of support from professional chiropractic organizations. Similar factors were identified by Lawrence (2008) among profession-al chiropractic leaders in the US. 61 In contrast, a number of facilitators were identified, including access to online education materials related to EBP, access to free online databases and access to critical reviews of relevant re-search evidence. This emphasizes the need for high qual-ity continuing education programs on EBP to better meet the needs of the chiropractic profession. A wareness of Canadian chiropractic CPGs published between 2005 and 2011 was very high, with over 80% of respondents indicating that they were familiar or very familiar with most of the recommendations. However, only half of the respondents agreed or strongly agreed that these guidelines had significantly impacted on how they managed their patients. Different reasons can ex-plain these findings, including: compliance with recom - mended practice was already high among respondents; the proposed guidelines were not deemed to be of suf-ficient quality to be implemented, or individual barriers to guideline uptake prevailed. Two recent qualitative studies focusing on chiropractors' views about barriers to using CPGs and best practice identified common theor - etical domains likely to influence compliance with rec-ommended care among DCs in North America. 62,63 These barriers included: conflicting beliefs about the potential consequences of applying recommended care in practice (beliefs about consequences), concerns over perceived threats to professional autonomy, professional credibility, lack of standardization, and agreement with guidelines (social/professional role & identity), the influence of for - mal training, colleagues and patients (social influences), and guideline awareness and agreement (knowledge). Level of awareness of best practice was thought to be influenced by geographical isolation and negative views toward guidelines among US chiropractic leaders. 61 These factors were thought to be relevant for Canadian DCs as well. 64 Ongoing efforts to identify these modifiable de- terminants of clinicians' guideline adherence are needed to design tailored knowledge translation strategies to en-courage evidence-based practice. Geographical variations When comparing our results with those from a similar study of American chiropractors 34 striking similarities were observed in terms of the average scores on the at-titudes, skills, and use subscales. The American study found average attitudes subscale scores of 31.4 compared with our average of 32.0. American average skills sub-scale scores were 44.3, compared to 43.0 for Canadian respondents. Finally, the average American and Canadian use subscale scores were equal at 10.3. Our findings are also similar to studies conducted in Australia, USA, Ger - many and the UK where chiropractors report favourable attitudes toward EBP 24-27, but many fail to routinely use EBP to inform clinical decision making24,25. Failure to translate clinical and health services research into practice and policy is not limited to chiropractic, however; it is an issue spanning the wider health care system. 18 Implications for education and guideline implementationThe passive dissemination of CPGs results only in small practice changes. 65 Our results suggest that educational emphasis should be focused on improving the skills of DCs J Can Chiropr Assoc Stuber, R Evans, MJ Schneider with respect to the appraisal and application of research evidence to clinical practice. This may be facilitated by providing access to EBP tools (e.g., a central repository of CPGs and best practices relevant to the scope of practice), and by offering online and face-to-face training. 66 Under - standing barriers to professional behaviour change is an important component of successful dissemination and im-plementation efforts. 67 We are currently in the process of evaluating the feasibility of implementing a theory-based knowledge translation strategy designed to overcome previously identified barriers in the chiropractic setting. 63 This multifaceted strategy includes a webinar series, clin - ical vignettes, and online learning modules. Study limitations Strengths of this study include the use of a validated and reliable measure of EBP attitudes, skills and use. Nonethe-less, this project has several important limitations. First, while attempts were made to maximize the response rate by using the principles of the Dillman method 68 (includ- ing pre-announcement in this journal, and sending out in-vitations and multiple reminders to participate by national and provincial associations), we are unable to determine the generalizability of our findings to the total population of Canadian chiropractors; this is partly because our sam-ple was a convenience sample of members of the CCA limited to those with email addresses who did not previ-ously opt-out from receiving these. Notwithstanding, al-though the response rate was low, study participants were generally representative of the target population in terms of gender, years in practice and geographical location. 50,67 Survey respondents also had similar ages, number of pa-tients seen daily, levels of education, and focus of prac-tice; indicating that our sample was likely to be repre-sentative of Canadian DCs. 51,69 Still, we cannot exclude the possibility of response bias and should be cautious about generalizing results. For example, it is possible that the 'attitudes' sub-scores were skewed toward higher val-ues because participants were already positively biased in favour of an evidence-based practice paradigm prior to taking part in the survey. Second, as with most sur - vey designs, there was a reliance on self-reported infor - mation, which has its own limitations. For example, the 'skills' sub-score was based on the participants' self-per - ceived level of skill; we did not formally test participant knowledge or skills with respect to EBP. Future evalua -tion of DC skills, knowledge and actual behaviours re-lated to EBP would provide an improved understanding of the chiropractic profession's needs and better inform the design of targeted EBP interventions. Also, while our exploratory analyses yielded interesting and potentially important findings regarding the relationships between practitioner characteristics and EBP attitudes, skills and behaviours, the significant findings were based upon only weak to moderate correlations. Thus, these results should be interpreted with caution and explored further in future research. Conclusions The results of this survey have provided additional in-sights into the attitudes, skills and use of EBP among Canadian chiropractors. Chiropractors generally had moderate to strong positive attitudes about EBP and mod-erate to high level skills in acquiring research evidence. However, the application of research evidence in clinic - al practice remains challenging. Results from this survey provide a baseline measure and can inform the design of future theory-based knowledge translation interventions to help improve chiropractors' level of EBP literacy and use of evidence in clinical practice.

Methods: We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials from January 1, 1990 to March 14, 2015. Paired reviewers independently screened titles and abstracts for eligibility. The internal validity of studies was assessed using the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN) criteria. Results from studies with a low risk of bias were synthesized using the best-evidence synthesis methodology. Results: We identified two randomized trials with a low risk of bias. Our review suggests that: 1) multimodal care and corticosteroid injections lead to faster pain relief and improvement than reassurance and advice in the short-term and similar outcomes in the long-term for patients with persistent lateral epicondylitis; and 2) providing health education material alone may be less effective than multimodal care for the management of persistent patellofemoral pain syndrome. Conclusion: Our systematic search of the literature demonstrates that little is known about the effectiveness of structured patient education for the management of musculoskeletal disorders and injuries of the extremities. Two studies suggest that when used alone, structured patient education may be less effective than other interventions used to manage persistent lateral epicondylitis and persistent patellofemoral syndrome.

Introduction Musculoskeletal disorders and injuries are a common source of pain in the upper and lower extremities. In the Netherlands, the point prevalence of musculoskeletal pain ranges from 5% for ankle pain to 21% for shoulder pain. 1 In the United States, 16% and 36% of all injuries presenting to emergency departments are sprains and/or strains of the upper and lower extremities respectively. 2,3 In Saskatchewan, 35.1% and 27.5% of individuals in-volved in motor vehicle collisions report upper and lower extremity pain respectively. 2 Musculoskeletal disorders and injuries of the extrem - ities are associated with a significant burden of disabil - ity for individuals, workplaces and health care systems. In Australia, individuals who report shoulder pain and/or stiffness have lower health-related quality of life and are more likely to report depressive symptoms than those without shoulder complaints. 4 In the United States, the median time away from work because of occupational injuries to the upper and lower extremities in 2013 were 10 and 12 days respectively. 5 In Ontario, Canada, leg and ankle injuries accounted for 18% of lost time claims in 2013, while shoulder injuries accounted for 6% of lost time claims among workers. 6 Furthermore, two thirds of Canadians with sprains or strains experience some level of disability and seek medical care. 7 Clinicians commonly educate patients in a structured or unstructured way during a course of care to manage musculoskeletal disorders and injuries. Structured patient education involves standardized interventions delivered through pamphlets, books, videos, discussion with health-care providers, or the internet. 8 Very little is known about the effectiveness of structured patient education for the management of musculoskeletal disorders and injuries of the extremities. A recent review on the effectiveness of structured patient education for the management of neck pain concluded that structured education alone cannot be expected to yield large benefits to patients with neck pain. 9 The purpose of this systematic review was to determine the effectiveness of structured patient education com-pared to other interventions, placebo/sham interventions or no intervention in improving self-rated recovery, func-tional recovery (e.g., return to activities, work or school), or clinical outcomes (e.g., pain, health-related quality of life, depression) of patients with musculoskeletal disor - ders and injuries of the upper and lower extremities.Methods Registration This review protocol was registered with the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROS-PERO) on April 9th, 2014 (CRD42014009287). Eligibility Criteria Population: Our review targeted studies of adults or chil- dren with musculoskeletal disorders and injuries of the upper and lower extremities. We excluded studies involv-ing pathology (e.g., fractures, dislocations, infection, neo-plasm, or systemic disease). We defined musculoskeletal disorders and injuries, based on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) definition, as grade I-II sprains or strains, nonspecific shoulder, elbow, wrist, hip, knee, ankle and/or foot pain, tendonitis, tendinopathy, tendinosis and other musculoskeletal disorders and in-juries (including neuropathies) as informed by available evidence. 10 Studies of grade I-III ankle sprains and strains were considered if a grade specific analysis was con-ducted or if a trial included the same distribution of grade III injuries across intervention groups. Intervention: W e restricted our review to studies that tested the effectiveness of structured patient education. We defined structured patient education as a process of enabling individuals to make informed decisions about their personal health-related behaviour. 11 For the purpose of our review, we considered patient education interven-tions to be structured, standardized, and condition-specif - ic. Therefore, we investigated structured patient education strategies that were delivered through pamphlets, books, videos, formal/structured discussion with healthcare pro-viders, or the internet, where the education interventions focused on reassurance or advice on activation, exercise, expected pain and its mechanism, prognosis, stress-cop-ing skills, workplace ergonomics, self-care strategies or general health. Because of its nature, structured patient education can be differentiated from the usual education that is routinely provided by clinicians during the course of clinical care. Our goal was to determine the effective-ness that can be specifically attributed to structured patient education; therefore, we excluded education interventions that were provided in multimodal programs of care that did not permit an assessment of the effect of structured patient education alone.352 J Can Chiropr Assoc 2015; 59(4)The effectiveness of structured patient education for the management of musculoskeletal disorders and injuries of the extremities Comparison groups: We included studies that used other education interventions, placebo/sham intervention, wait list, no intervention or other conservative or invasive interventions. Outcomes: T o be eligible, studies had to include one of the following outcomes: 1) self-rated recovery; 2) func-tional recovery (e.g. disability, return to activities, work, or school); 3) clinical outcomes (e.g. pain, health-related quality of life, depression); 4) administrative data (e.g. time on benefits); or 5) adverse events. Study characteristics: Study inclusion and exclusion criteria are listed in Table 1. Information sources We developed our search strategy with a health sciences librarian (Appendix 1). A second librarian reviewed the search strategy for completeness and accuracy using the Peer Review of Electronic Search Strategies (PRESS) Checklist. 12,13 We searched the PsycINFO, and the Cochrane Central of Controlled Trials (Ovid). We searched all bibliographic databases from January 1 st, 1990 to March 14th, 2015. W e first developed the search strategy in MEDLINE and subsequently adapted it to other bibliographic data - bases. The search terms included subject headings (e.g. MeSH for MEDLINE) specific to each database and free text words relevant to our research question and inclusion criteria. Study Selection We used a two-phase screening process to select eligible studies. In phase one, random pairs of independent re-viewers screened titles and abstracts of citations to de-termine the eligibility of studies. Phase one screening resulted in studies being classified as relevant, possibly relevant, or irrelevant. In phase two, the same pairs of reviewers independently screened possibly relevant studies to determine eligibility. Reviewers met to resolve disagreements and reach consensus on the eligibility of studies. We involved a third reviewer if consensus could not be reached. Assessment of Risk of Bias Random pairs of independent reviewers critically ap-praised the internal validity of eligible studies using the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN) criteria. 14 The SIGN criteria were used to qualitatively evaluate the presence and impact of selection bias, infor - mation bias, and confounding on the results of a study. We did not use a quantitative score or a cut-off to determine the internal validity of studies. 15 Rather, the SIGN criteria Table 1. Study inclusion and exclusion criteria Inclusion criteria Exclusion criteria English language Studies published between January 1st, 1990 and March 14th, 2015 Study designs including: randomized controlled trials (RCT s), cohort studies, case-control studies Inception cohort of at least 30 subjects per treatment arm for RCT s or 100 subjects per exposed group for cohort studies with musculoskeletal disorders or injuries of the upper and/or lower extremities Guidelines, letters, editorials, commentaries, unpublished manuscripts, dissertations, government reports, books and book chapters, conference proceedings, meeting abstracts, lectures and addresses, consensus development statements, or guideline statements Cross-sectional studies, case reports, case series, qualitative studies, narrative reviews, systematic reviews, clinical practice guidelines, biomechanical studies, or laboratory studies Cadaveric or animal studies Studies on patients with severe injuries (e.g. grade III sprains/strains, fractures, dislocations, full ruptures, infections, malignancy , Gross, et al. were used to assist reviewers to make an informed overall judgment on the internal validity of studies. This method-ology has been previously described. 16-21 Specifically , we critically appraised the following methodological aspects of an RCT: 1) clarity of the re-search question; 2) randomization method; 3) conceal - ment of treatment allocation; 4) blinding of treatment and outcomes; 5) similarity of baseline characteristics be-tween/among treatment arms; 6) co-intervention contam - ination; 7) validity and reliability of outcome measures; 8) follow-up rates; 9) analysis according to intention to treat principles; and 10) comparability of results across study sites (where applicable). Reviewers reached con-sensus through discussion. An independent third reviewer was used to resolve disagreements if consensus could not be reached. Following critical appraisal, studies with a low risk of bias were included in our synthesis. Data Extraction and Synthesis of Results The lead author extracted data from studies with a low risk of bias and built evidence tables (Table 3). A second reviewer independently checked the extracted data. W e performed a qualitative synthesis of findings from studies with a low risk of bias to develop evidence state - ments according to principles of best evidence synthe-sis. 22 An intervention was deemed to be effective if it was associated with statistically significant and clinically im-portant improvements in outcomes. Statistical Analysis We computed agreements between reviewers for the screening of articles and reported the kappa statistic (k) and 95% confidence interval (CI). 23 We computed differ - ences in mean changes between groups (with 95% CI) where data were available. The computation of CIs as-sumed an r=0.80 between baseline and follow-up out-come values. 24,25 W e stratified our results according to the type of dis-order, duration [i.e. recent ( 3 months) versus persistent (>3 months)]. W e used standardized cut-off values to determine if clinically important changes were reached in each trial for common outcome measures. These include a be-tween-group difference of 10/100 mm or 10% difference Citations identified through database searching: 13,209Identified through other sources: 1 Duplicates removed: 2,003 Full-text articles excluded: 23 Primary reasons for exclusion: - Sample size too small = 3 - Ineligible study design = 4 - Intervention is not eligible = 12 - Ineligible condition = 3 - Ineligible outcome measures = 1Citations screened using titles and abstracts: 11,207 Citations screened using eligibility using full-text: 25Ineligible citations: 11,182 Eligible for critical appraisal in full text: 2 Articles deemed low risk of bias: 2Articles deemed high risk of bias: 0 Figure 1: Flow diagram of the number (n) of selected studies for effectiveness.354 J Can Chiropr Assoc 2015; 59(4)The effectiveness of structured patient education for the management of musculoskeletal disorders and injuries of the extremities Table 2.

Of those, we found two rel-evant studies and both had a low risk of bias. 30,31 The pri- mary reasons for exclusion in full text screening were: small sample size (RCTs n<30, cohort studies n<100), in-eligible study design, inability to determine the effective - ness of patient education alone, ineligible condition, and ineligible outcome measures. We were unable to com-pute the inter-rater agreement for the screening of arti-cles because only one relevant study was found through screening of the citations retrieved from the electronic search. The percentage agreement for the critical apprais-al of articles was 100% (2/2 RCTs) based on admissible/inadmissible results. Study Characteristics We identified two RCTs with a low risk of bias; one study addressed the management of persistent lateral epicondy-litis 31 and the other focused on persistent patellofemoral pain syndrome.30 We did not identify studies that investi - gated the effectiveness of structured patient education for the management of nerve entrapment syndromes. Risk of Bias within Studies Both RCTs with a low risk of bias had: 1) adequate treat-ment randomization and concealment methods; 2) sim-ilar groups at baseline; 3) valid and reliable outcome measures; and 4) intention to treat analyses (Table 2). The study follow-up rates were greater than 80% al. Table 3.

Bisset et al. randomized participants to: 1) reassurance and advice on self-manage - ment (activity modification, analgesic drugs, heat, cold or braces as needed); 2) multimodal care (elbow manipula - tion, clinic and home based exercise) provided in eight sessions over six weeks; or 3) one corticosteroid injection of the painful elbow joint and advice to return to normal activities (a second injection was offered after two weeks if necessary). All participants received an information booklet covering the disease process, self-management, and ergonomics. Participants randomized to the reassur - ance and advice group were less likely to report self-per - ceived improvement than those in the multimodal care group [Relative Risk (RR) = 0.38 (99% CI 0.24; 0.61)] at six weeks (Table 3). There were statistically signifi-cant and clinically important differences in pain severity [mean change difference on V AS: 15.6/100mm (99% CI 4.7; 26.4)] favouring advice at the six-week follow-up. Similarly, the au-thors reported statistically significant differences in pain-free grip at six weeks and elbow disability at six weeks and 12 weeks favouring multimodal care over reassurance and advice. The minimal clinically important differences (MCIDs) for pain-free grip strength and elbow disabil - ity are unknown. When compared to the corticosteroid group, participants randomized to reassurance and advice were less likely to report self-perceived improvement [RR 0.30 (95% CI 0.19; 0.48)] at the six week follow-up (Table 3). There were statistically significant and clinical - ly important improvements in pain severity [mean change difference on V AS: 31.3/100mm (99% CI 20.5; 42.2)] favouring advice at the six-week follow-up. Similarly, the cortico - steroid group reported statistically significant improve - ments in pain-free grip force and elbow disability at the six-week follow-up. However, those in the reassurance and advice group reported greater improvements com-pared to the corticosteroid group in pain-free grip strength and elbow disability at 26 weeks (Table 3). At 52 weeks, improvements in pain severity favoured the reassurance and advice group; however, these improvements were clinically Persistent Patellofemoral Pain Syndrome Evidence from one RCT suggests that an exercise-based multimodal care program by a physical therapist may provide superior outcomes to health education for the management of persistent patellofemoral pain syndrome. 30 In their study, Song et al. randomized participants to: 1) multimodal care that included hot pack application to the quadriceps femoris, followed by leg press exercis-es, stretching and cold pack; 2) multimodal care plus hip adduction strengthening; or 3) health education material regarding patellofemoral pain (format not specified). Re-sults from the multimodal care plus hip adduction arm are not presented due to the small sample size (n<30). Leg press exercises were carried out using an EN-Dynamic Track Machine (5 sets of 10 repetitions; 3 times/week; over 8 weeks) with 15 minutes of hot pack applied to the quadriceps femoris prior to exercise. The control group re-ceived health education material regarding patellofemoral pain (specific content not reported). Immediately follow-ing the eight week intervention, participants who received the multimodal intervention of leg press exercises com-bined with hot pack experienced statistically significant but not clinically important improvements in pain [mean change difference on V AS: 2.41/100mm (95% CI 1.62; 3.20)] compared to the patient education group (Table 3). Additionally, participants who received the multimodal care program had statistically significant improvement in function, vastus medialis oblique (VMO) cross-sectional area and VMO volume. The clinical importance of these differences is unclear. Although there were statistically significant differences in all outcome measures, there is marked uncertainty for the reported pain value. Specif-ically, the pain measurement scale (V AS 0-100 mm) de-scribed in the methodology and tables is incongruent, e.g. the value is very small, given that the primary complaint in patellofemoral pain syndrome would be anticipated to be pain. Extensive efforts were undertaken to contact the authors for clarification, but no response was received. Therefore, the results of this study should be interpreted with caution. Adverse events One of the two studies reported on adverse events. 31 Bis- set et al. reported that 20% of participants experienced adverse events associated with the corticosteroid injec - tion. In the same study, 10.6% of participants reported ad-verse events associated with multimodal care. The most common adverse event was pain after treatment (19/20 events). No adverse events were reported by those ran-domized to reassurance and advice. 31 DiscussionAlthough structured patient education is commonly rec-ommended for the management of musculoskeletal dis-orders and injuries, our review demonstrates that very little is known about its effectiveness. We found two RCTs with a low risk of bias that provide evidence on the effectiveness of structured patient education for the management of musculoskeletal injuries in the upper and lower extremities. We found that, in the short-term, struc-tured patient education is less effective, than multimodal care or corticosteroid injection for the management of persistent lateral epicondylitis. We also found evidence that an exercise-based multimodal program of care may be superior to structured patient education for persistent patellofemoral syndrome immediately post-intervention. However, the clinical importance of this result is un-known. We found no admissible studies to inform the use of patient education for the management of musculoskel - etal disorders and injuries of other extremities. Our review reached similar conclusions on structured patient education as the previous review on the effective - ness of structured patient education for the management of neck pain. Yu et al. recently reported that structured patient education alone may be less effective than other non-invasive interventions (i.e. physiotherapy, supervised exercises and massage) in improving pain, functional re-covery and clinical outcomes. 9 However, their review also found no evidence to suggest that one method of deliv - ering an education intervention (i.e. oral versus written) is more effective than the other. 9 We did not find any studies with a low risk of bias comparing one form of structured patient education to another. Our review has important clinical implications. Al- though it suggests that structured patient education may not be effective on its own for the management of ex-tremity injuries, it does not suggest that clinicians should abandon educating patients. Educating patients about their condition, prognosis and appropriate treatment is always indicated and necessary when providing clinical care. Furthermore, in the study by Bisset et al., multi-modal care that included an education booklet (disease 358 J Can Chiropr Assoc 2015; 59(4)The effectiveness of structured patient education for the management of musculoskeletal disorders and injuries of the extremities process, self-management, ergonomics) along with elbow manipulation, exercise (supervised and home-based), and self-manipulation was found to be statistically and clin - ically more important than education alone for persistent lateral epicondylitis. 31 Another systematic review by Sut- ton et al., suggested that multimodal care that includes manual therapy, education and exercise may benefit pa-tients with grades I and II whiplash associated disorders and neck pain and associated disorders. 32 Therefore, our review suggests that education should not be used as a standalone intervention, but may be provided in combina - tion with other effective interventions for musculoskeletal disorders and injuries of the extremities. Our review has several strengths. First, we imple - mented a comprehensive and rigorous search strategy that was reviewed by a second librarian to help minimize errors. Second, we defined clear inclusion and exclu - sion criteria for the selection of relevant studies. Third, we used trained pairs of independent reviewers to screen and critically appraise the literature to minimize error and bias. Fourth, the SIGN criteria were used to standardize the critical appraisal process and to inform our scien-tific judgment. Lastly, our conclusions were based on a best-evidence synthesis, which involves excluding stud-ies of low quality to minimize the risk of bias. Our review also has limitations. First, we limited our search to studies published in the English language, which may have excluded some relevant studies. How-ever, this is an unlikely source of bias as the majority of trials are published in English. The sole inclusion of trials published in English has not previously led to biased re-sults. 33-36 Secondly, the critical appraisal process entails scientific judgment that may differ between reviewers. This potential bias was minimized by training review-ers to utilize a standardized critical appraisal tool and by using a consensus process. Lastly, we chose to exclude grey literature and unpublished trials because there are no systematic methods to search for this literature and these articles are often not peer reviewed. Conclusion Our systematic review demonstrates that very little is known about the effectiveness of structured patient edu-cation for the management of musculoskeletal disorders and injuries in the upper or lower extremities. For per - sistent lateral epicondylitis, the evidence suggests that reassurance and advice is associated with worse short-term outcomes than multimodal care or corticosteroid injections; however, the long-term outcomes are similar between interventions. Moreover, the evidence suggests that health education is less effective than strengthening exercises and hot packs in the short-term management of persistent patellofemoral syndrome. The effectiveness of structured patient education for musculoskeletal disorders and injuries in other extremities needs to be explored. Fu-ture research must have a low risk of bias and focus on specific forms of structured patient education for upper and lower extremities. Until further evidence indicates otherwise, it seems clinically reasonable that patient edu-cation should not be used as a standalone intervention, but rather in combination with other effective interventions for musculoskeletal disorders and injuries of the extrem - ities.

Universal healthcare coverage reduces the financial barrier to healthcare utilization, thereby increasing the opportunity for the financially disadvantaged to have access to care. In 2011 the Canadian Province of Manitoba initiated a pilot program providing access to chiropractic care within the Mount Carmel Clinic (MCC), a non-secular, non-profit, inner city community health centre. Objective: To describe the initial integration of chiropractic services into a publically funded healthcare Contexte d'avoir acc\u00e8s aux soins.

Method: A retrospective database review of chiropractic consultations in 2011 (N=177) was performed. Results: The typical patient referred for chiropractic care was a non-working (86%), 47.3(SD=16.8) year old, who self-identified as Caucasian (52.2%), or Aboriginal (35.8%) and female (68.3%) with a body mass index considered obese at 30.4(SD=7.0). New patient consultations were primarily referrals from other health providers internal to the MCC (71.2%), frequently primary care physicians (76%). Baseline to discharge comparisons of numeric rating scale scores for the cervical, thoracic, lumbar, sacroiliac and extremity regions all exceeded the minimally clinically important difference for reduction in musculoskeletal pain. Improvements occurred over an average of 12.7 (SD=14.3) treatments, and pain reductions were also statistically significant at p<0.05. Conclusion: Chiropractic services are being utilized by patients, and referring providers. Clinical outcomes indicate that services rendered decrease musculoskeletal pain in an inner city population.

Conclusion : Les patients et les intervenants en mati\u00e8re de sant\u00e9 aiguillant les pharmacological or surgical treatment options when such approaches are clinically necessary.5 Chiropractic inter - vention targets the muscles and joints, using manual and physical procedures, most commonly including manipu - lation, massage, exercise and nutrition. 6 Typically chiro- practic patients report high levels of satisfaction with care. 7 Chiropractic services are considered relatively cost effective.8,9 Chiropractic intervention is considered safe, as there are a low number of adverse events that occur directly as a result of treatment. 10 Low-income populations utilize chiropractic care less than the general population.11 The financially disadvan- taged must carefully manage their limited economic re-sources. Engaging in a course of chiropractic care typ-ically involves financial consideration as it is excluded from many public and private health insurance plans. 12 Out of pocket expense for healthcare forces low income individuals to weigh the costs and benefits of healthcare against their other basic necessities of life. 12 The poor are more likely to utilize healthcare services when they can be provided by a universal healthcare system. The reason is that universal healthcare coverage reduces the financial barrier to healthcare utilization. 13,14 A lower income results in a greater propensity toward having unmet healthcare needs in both Canada and the United States. 15 A possible reason, at least in Canada, is that healthcare services such as dentistry, optometry, physical therapy and chiropractic are largely not reim - bursed by provincial healthcare plans. Delisted services, that were previously partially covered, have specifically been less accessed by the lowest income groups of the population. 14 User fees are the barrier to utilization of ser - vices for chiropractic and optometry, according to a study on the provision of free supplemental health care bene-fits for low-income families. 16 The result is that in order to be provided with reimbursement for services such as chiropractic, patients require coverage from a worker's compensation board, motor vehicle accident insurance provider, or other supplemental health insurance benefits provided by an employer. Without healthcare coverage, the burden of fee for services rendered falls on the patient and must be provided out-of-pocket regardless of their socioeconomic status and clinical need. In 201 1, the Mount Carmel Clinic (MCC), a provin- cially funded health centre in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Can-ada implemented fully government subsidized chiroprac -tic services, alongside its existing medical and dental services. The public funding of the chiropractic clinic addresses an issue raised by Soklaridis, Kelner, Love and Cassidy (2009) regarding the typical lack of funding al-located by the Canadian healthcare system toward com-plementary and alternative medicine. 17 Manitoba Health Family Services is demonstrating an interest in exploring universal and equitable access to health care that includes chiropractic services for underprivileged Manitobans. The MCC serves a demographic of the poor and under - served within Winnipeg, specifically an area with the high- est unemployment rate, and lowest average family income in the city. Since the chiropractic clinic was implemented a prospective quality assurance (QA) database has been maintained by the on-site chiropractors in collaboration with the administration at the MCC. The purpose of main-taining a prospective QA database is that the data can be used to evaluate service utilization, and relevant impacts of clinic implementation. 18 The purpose of this manuscript is to evaluate what the outcome of the initial integration has been in the first year of a publically funded inner city chiropractic clinic integrated within a multidisciplinary health centre targeting the poor and underserved. Methods The study utilized a cross-sectional, retrospective exam - ination of prospectively collected QA data attained from the MCC chiropractic clinic database. All data were col-lected during calendar year 2011. The database is main - tained at the MCC by the chiropractic clinicians on site. A university-based researcher, with a clinical background, summarized all data. Patient data was completely de-iden - tified upon entry into an anonymous database prior to an-alysis and interpretation. Permission to conduct the study of the database was attained from the officer of records at the MCC as well as the University of Manitoba Health Research Ethics Board. The MCC is a provincially funded, non-secular , non-profit, inner city multidisciplinary community health centre located centrally in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Can-ada. The MCC chiropractors receive an hourly wage, on par with physician pay grade as approved by Manitoba Health. There is no financial incentive to see patients for a longer course of care than the minimum clinically war - ranted to induce difference, or long enough to determine that their presentation does not respond to chiropractic 366 J Can Chiropr Assoc 2015; 59(4)Initial integration of chiropractic services into a provincially funded inner city community health centre: a program description care and an appropriate referral can be identified. The two chiropractors are part-time independent contractors, each spending 1-day per week at the clinic. Services that the chiropractors at the MCC provide are summarized in Table 1. New patient s referred to the clinic received a new pa- tient assessment and then either underwent informed con-sent procedures to initiate a course of chiropractic manage - ment, or were referred to another appropriate health care provider if chiropractic intervention was not clinically warranted. Follow up visits during a typical course of care included spinal or extremity joint manipulation and/or mobilization, soft tissue therapy, and potentially other modalities including contemporary medical acupuncture. Re-evaluation visits were scheduled after every 4-6 treat-ment visits to assess whether patients were responding to care, not responding to care, or had reached a plateau in therapeutic response to intervention. Time slot durations for new patient assessments, re-evaluations, and follow up visit time duration allotments were designed by the clinicians in tandem with the MCC. Typical new patient assessments were scheduled for 30-60 minutes, while treatment visits and re-evaluation visits were 15-30 min-utes in duration. Analysis Analysis of reported data consists of interpretation of raw numbers, and percentages of respondents to items from the database. Most unique patients (N=177) attended the clinic on multiple occasions, which is why the completed treatment visit total is 1803. Any discrepancies between the number of patients in the study (N=177), and the num-bers used for comparison to derive percentages, is due to participants choosing to abstain from a question, or if the course of care was completed (from intake to discharge) during calendar year 2011. Paired two-tailed Student's T-tests were used for analy - sis comparing baseline, and discharge outcome measures. Specifically, separate analyses were performed for the numeric rating scale (NRS) scores of completed courses of management that were targeted to the cervical, thor - acic, lumbar, sacroiliac, and extremity regions. Some pa-tients had multiple regions of complaint, and treatment and thus reported separate NRS scores for each region. Raw NRS point change, and percentages of baseline at discharge changes were also reported.ResultsFemale patients represented just over two-thirds (68.3%) of patient treatment visits at the MCC chiropractic clinic. While there was a diverse range for ages of patients, that data is skewed toward the aging population, with 48.9% of all treatment visits going to patients 51 years of age or older. Patients self reported their height and weight, which facilitated body mass index (BMI) calculation. The average BMI was 30.4 (SD=7.0) based on 120 unique re-spondents, which is considered obese. Of all unique pa-tients who visited the chiropractic clinic, 91/177 (54.8%) patients had a BMI < 30 and were not considered obese. Patients were asked to voluntarily self-identify their eth-nic background. While a full spectrum of cultural back-grounds were reported Caucasian, and Aboriginal indi-viduals made up 52.2% and 35.8% of the clinic's popula-tion respectively.

Patients not currently working (86%) utilized the ma-jority of chiropractic clinic visits. Only 9 of 161 (6.0%) of new patients who completed treatment required new radiographs that were not already in their medical rec-ord, prior to initiating a course of care. A typical course of care from intake to discharge on average consisted of 12.7 (SD=14.3) treatment visits based on 160 completed cases in calendar year 2011. Of appointm ents scheduled 74.5% (1763/2365) of total clinic visits were kept, presently there is no penalty for failing to attend a scheduled visit. Only 2.9% (52/1803) of patient visits to the clinic were unscheduled \"walk-ins\". When patients were asked if their \"initial chiropractic visit saved them from making an additional PCP visit\" of the 161 respondents, 132 (82.0%) stated \"yes\" it did. When discharged from chiropractic only 7 (4.0%) of 161 respondents required referral to another healthcare pro-vider for additional care. Referral by other healthcare providers on-site within the MCC made up the majority (71.2%) of new patients at the chiropractic clinic (Table 3). Referral by healthcare providers from outside of the MCC consisted of a small number of patients (4.0%). Primary care physicians were the greatest referral source from healthcare providers (76.0%). During the first four months of clinic operation both new patient visits (Figure 1), and total patient visits (Fig-ure 2) increased steadily. During the final five months of the year it appeared that a steady state of clinic operation had been reached. There was a mean of 14.8 new patients (177/12) per month, and 135.5 ([1803-177]/12) follow-up visits per month during the inaugural clinic year. There were consistently more patients seeking manage - ment for chronic conditions (symptoms >3 months in dur - ation) as revealed by examination of the ratio of acute to chronic condition patients (Table 4). For those with acute pain seeking treatment, there was a relatively even dis-Table 2.

For patients with chronic pain seeking treatment, the fewest number of pa-tients had extremity region pain (13.0%), while the great - est proportion of patients sought care for pain in the lum-bar region (26.8%). Patients who received high-velocity low-amplitude (HVLA) joint manipulation, mobilization, and soft tissue intervention, had those interventions directed most often toward the thoracic and lumbar spinal regions followed by the cervical region (Table 5). Similar numbers of patients received HVLA joint manipulation, mobilization, and soft tissue intervention to the same treatment regions, likely due to the multifaceted nature of chiropractic interven - tion (Table 5). Contemporary medical acupuncture when used (48 cases) was most commonly targeted toward the cervical (16/48 cases; 33.3%) and extremity (14/48 cases; 29.2%) regions. The greatest use of other care modalities within a course of chiropractic management were those directed toward the lumbar spine (67 cases; 25.4%) and the sacroiliac regions (62; 23.5%).

According to Salaffi et al. (2004), the MCID for chronic musculoskeletal pain is a NRS change of -15.0% or at least -1 point. 19 A change of -33.0% or at least -2 points is associated with a patient reporting they feel \"much better\". Based on the NRS data collected from baseline compared to discharge all four spinal (cer - vical, thoracic, lumbar, and sacroiliac) and the extremity regions responded to chiropractic intervention in excess of a MCID (Table 6). In terms of percent improvement, a course of care directed to the extremity regions attained improvement beyond 33.0% (Table 6). In terms of point change, the LS, SI and extremity regions (Table 6) all demonstrated change beyond 2 points, an improvement associated with patients feeling \"much better\", following chiropractic intervention. Upon completion of a course of care of 161 chiropractic cases, 154 (96%) did not warrant referral to another healthcare provider. Discussion While the integration of chiropractic care into an inner city government funded multidisciplinary healthcare facility is relatively novel, there are isolated examples that can be used for comparison. For example integration of chiro-practic services occurred a decade ago within the United States Veterans Health Administration, and a unique com-munity health centre example in the province of Ontario, Canada. The characteristics of a typical MCC chiroprac-tic patient differ drastically from those who are seen in a United States Veterans Affairs hospital chiropractic clinic most notably in age and gender representation. The typ-ical veteran chiropractic patient was a 54.8 (SD=15.9) year old male (88.4%). 20 MCC patients referred for chiro- practic care were typically 47.3(SD=16.8) year old fe-males (68.3%), who self identified as Caucasian (52.2%), or Aboriginal (35.8%) and non-working (86%) (Table 2). The MCC chiropractic patient population more close-ly resembled the Southern Ontario Community Health Centre (CHC) chiropractic clinic population in terms of age and gender representation. 21 Patients over the age of 50 made up 44.1% of the CHC population, and 48.9% of the MCC population. Also similar was that the gender representation of the CHC was 73.0% female. The CHC is a chiropractic clinic that was created in Ottawa, On-tario, Canada as a demonstration project by the Ontario Ministry of Health and Long Term Care, who were also exploring the integration of chiropractors into multidisci - plinary primary care settings. Dif ferences between the populations seen by the CHC chiropractic clinic and the MCC chiropractic clinic in-clude the distribution of regions of complaint. The CHC data reveals their clinic largely treated the low back re-gion (56.0%) with no other spinal region exceeding 11.6% of their population, or extremity region exceeding 6.6%. 21 In contrast, treatment of the lumbar region made up only 19.8% (acute pain) and 26.8% (chronic pain) of MCC chiropractic visits. Treatment of the cervical and thoracic spinal regions (Table 4) was greater at the MCC as was treatment of extremity regions that were 27.6% Table 6.

J Can Chiropr Assoc 2015; 59(4)Initial integration of chiropractic services into a provincially funded inner city community health centre: a program description (acute pain) and 13.0% (chronic pain) visits respectively (Table 4). Baseline, discharge, and change in NRS pain scores were similar between the CHC chiropractic clinic, and the MCC chiropractic clinic. Garner et al., did not report the NRS by region, but the typical NRS at baseline was M=6.2(SD=2.4), and discharge M=3.9(SD=2.7) for a change of -2.3 points. 21 If the MCC chiropractic lumbar region data is used for comparison, NRS at baseline was M=6.8(SD=2.5) and discharge was M=4.8(SD=2.9) for a change of -2.0 points, which is similar to the CHC find-ings. At the MCC chiropractic clinic while 74.5% of sched- uled visits were kept, 25.5% is a noteworthy no-show rate. Higher no-show rates are predicted in underserved populations. 22 In a primary care setting no-show rates as high as 50% have been reported.23 Strategies to decrease no-show rates include implementing a phone-call re-minder system, and discharging the patient from care fol-lowing 2 or more no-show visits. Strategies to lessen the burden of no-show visits on clinic performance include using predictions of no-show rates to strategically over - book a clinic or encouraging \"walk-in\" treatment visits. 23 The observation that nearly three quarters of chiropractic appointments are kept is an indication that patients value the care they are receiving. There are examples of other health clinics that target inner city or include low-income populations and deliv - er chiropractic services. At least twenty-four chiropractic programs in academic institutions provide free or low-cost services targeted to those who live in poverty. 5 The programs take place around the globe in countries such as Canada, England, South Africa, The United States, Brazil, Korea, France, and Australia. The MCC differs from those sites in three specific ways. The first differ - ence is financial, the MCC chiropractic clinic is directly supported by provincial healthcare family services fund-ing for its operating costs including clinician salaries, as opposed to being funded by an academic institution. 24 The second difference is that the services provided come dir - ectly from an experienced chiropractor. Clinical student interns supervised by academic clinicians deliver care in other \"outreach\" model clinics. 25 The third difference is that patients do not require a specific vocational or ser - vice background (veterans) to qualify as a patient.20 At the MCC to be eligible for care you must simply be: 1) on social assistance, or classified as \"working poor\"; 2) have a postal code that reflects you are a resident of the Point Douglas neighbourhood or North End of Winnipeg; 3) be a refugee who has recently moved to Manitoba; or 4) be referred by another community outreach program. Also, all MCC patients must not having standing claims with organizations that would otherwise pay for healthcare ser - vices such as the Workers Compensation Board (WCB), or Manitoba Public Insurance (MPI) which covers servi-ces related to automobile accidents. While the QA database was maintained prospective - ly, the concept of data utilization for research purposes is retrospective. A limitation of the present study is that research questions and interpretation are limited as to the headings included for data capture in the initial design of the database. In addition caution should be taken with the generalization of the results. The study population was the entire intake in the first year of chiropractic patients in an inner city clinic in Manitoba, and may not exactly reflect a rural population, or other urban centers across North America. Lessons Learned In order to integrate a new clinical specialty for under - privileged patients, a clinic requires adequate funding. In the case of the MCC that funding comes from provincial taxpayers through Manitoba Health Family Services. The support of Manitoba Health Family Services provided the salary lines to attract highly skilled professionals. By pro-viding funding as an hourly wage, and not fee for service, providers are not motivated to see a patient any more than is clinically warranted to induce a positive therapeutic change. Our results indicate that bringing a chiropractor into a publically funded healthcare team anecdotally de-creases the number of primary care visits a patient per - ceives they need. Reduction in number of primary care visits made by the aforementioned patients, increases the amount of time the primary care provider can spend inter - acting with patients who are in absolute need of the servi-ces of a medical physician. Upon dischar ge from clinical care very few patients who benefited from chiropractic intervention required other clinical services. No longer requiring other clinic - al services further unburdens other care providers in the clinic who may have heavy clinic loads, or even patient waiting lists. According to our results the implementation of chiropractic services to a publically funded clinic was: Olin 1) a service that is utilized for referral by other health - care providers; 2) reduces pain in patients with acute and chronic spine or extremity pain, and; 3) a service that is valued by patients who would otherwise be unable to af-ford chiropractic services. Federal, and provincial policy makers, academics or philanthropic agencies may utilize the presented findings to gain insight as to QA measures to record, and what the potential benefit of adding chiropractic services to an inner city multidisciplinary healthcare facility targeted to the poor and underserved may be. Chiropractors typically practice in private outpatient clinics, or multidisciplinary clinics alongside physical therapists, registered massage therapists, or athletic therapists. 6 Popularity of inclusion of chiropractic services in private hospital facilities,26,27 veterans hospital facilities,20,28-30 and active military base settings31, are endeavours that have occurred in the past decade but continue to grow26,20,30. The data presented in this manuscript reflect clinic per - formance and patient demographics during the inaugural year in which the clinic was created. Follow-up studies exploring the evolution of this type of clinic are warranted to determine the need for expansion or reduction of ser - vices, or if a steady-state plateau is attained based on cur - rent clinic size and operation. Future studies will be able to compare year-year clinic growth/reduction, patient demographics, outcomes and overall clinical performance from a broader perspective. Future considerations in working with chiropractic integration of inner city populations include greater util - ization of empirically validated outcome measures. Al-though, questionnaire-based outcome measures should be applied with caution as results may be limited by the literacy and comprehension abilities of the population. 21 Objective performance-based outcome measures may provide better clinical insight in this and other popula-tions. 32 In future studies, the comparison of chiropractic care to other services provided at the MCC with regard to utilization, efficacy and patient satisfaction should be explored. In conclusion, chiropracti c services within a provin- cially funded, non-secular, non-profit, inner city multi - disciplinary community health centre are being utilized with positive results in pain reduction. Prospectively maintained QA data provides a useful window into clin - ic operation, and performance during clinic implemen -tation. The outcome of the initial integration in the first year of a publically funded chiropractic clinic targeting the poor and underserved has been successful in terms of exceeding minimally clinically important differences in all painful regions of the body targeted for treatment. The high clinic attendance rate and percentage of referrals for chiropractic services from primary healthcare providers in the MCC facility highlights the value that both patients and other clinicians place on the integration of chiroprac - tic services. Publically funded inner city chiropractic clinics target- ing the poor and underserved allow chiropractic services to be offered and utilized, specifically for more chronic pain conditions, by a component of the population that would otherwise likely be unable to attain healthcare due to a financial barrier. Future research on chiropractic clin - ic implementation into publically funded multidisciplin - ary facilities may include the number of primary care vis-its saved via integration, clinic model sustainability, and the cost/benefit of having chiropractic services added to a government funded healthcare system.

This case will highlight the importance of early recognition and considerations regarding patient management for this differential of radiating low back pain. Clinical Features: A 21-year-old provincial basketball player presented with recurrent radiating low back pain into the left groin and lower limb. After several weeks of persistent symptoms including pain, muscle weakness, and changes in the Achilles deep tendon reflex, imaging was obtained that revealed a large disc extrusion with an old posterior ring apophyseal fracture.

Recent literature reporting the incidence of PRAF occurring in conjunction with pediatric disc herniation ranges from 19-42%. 4-6 Managing disc-related injuries in the pediatric and with a spine surgeon and family physician, the patient was treated using a conservative, multimodal approach. Treatment consisted of graded mobilizations, spinal manipulative therapy, interferential current, and soft tissue therapy to the lumbar spine. Rehabilitation exercises focused on centralizing symptoms and improving strength, proprioception and function of the lower limb. After a period of 8 weeks, the patient was able to complete all activities of daily living without pain in addition to returning to basketball practice. Summary: PRAF is a unique condition in the immatur e spine and recent evidence suggests that those involved in sports requiring repetitive motion of the lumbar spine may be at increased risk. The astute clinician must consider this differential in young populations presenting with discogenic low back pain, as a timely diagnosis and necessary referral may allow for effective conservative management to reduce symptoms. Equally as important, one must be aware of the complications from PRAF as a contributing source of low back pain and dysfunction into adulthood. Knowing when to refer for advanced imaging and/or a surgical consult given the variable clinical presentation and prognosis is an essential component to care. (JCCA. 2015; 59(4):373-382) key words: et de reprendre les : Les fractures des post\u00e9rieures sont un pointe ou \u00e0 l'avis d'un chirurgien au vu de la pr\u00e9sentation clinique et est D'Angelo adolescent populations pose difficulty to the clinician as the history, clinical presentation, and response to care can be highly variable and atypical when compared to adults. Injuries such as PRAF and pars interarticularis fractures are unique to the immature spine and can mimic disc-like symptoms. 6 Unlike adult lumbar disc herniation, it has been reported that approximately 30-45% of pediatric patients suffer from a history of trauma, such as heavy lifting or athletic activity, prior to developing discog-enic symptoms. 3,7-10 Furthermore, it has been theorized that PRAF can occur in adolescent athletes as a result of cumulative or repetitive stress from sport-dependent movements. 9 With these issues taken into consideration, it is imperative to understand the clinical presentation in young active populations and to be aware of unique struc-tures that are vulnerable in the skeletally immature spine. Since skeletal maturity may not be reached until the ages of 18-25 years, formulating a differential diagnosis that includes PRAF in children, adolescents, or young adults presenting with discogenic symptoms, is essential for pa-tient management. The purpose of this paper is to discuss the clinical pres- entation and management of a case involving a posterior ring apophyseal fracture in a 21-year-old male provincial basketball player with a subsequent lumbar disc extru-sion. An update on the literature regarding this pathology will highlight relevant features of the clinical presenta - tion, diagnosis, and patient management. Case Presentation A 21-year-old male provincial basketball player sought chiropractic care for an episode of insidious left-sided radicular low back pain that travelled into the posterior thigh, lateral leg and ankle that persisted for eight days. He could not recall a specific mechanism of injury, but stated that pain began after participation in a recent week-end tournament with approximately 5 games in three days. In addition to the leg pain, the patient described a sharp, spasm-like pain in the left groin. The intensity of the pain was rated 8/10 on a visual analogue scale (V AS) and was most aggravated by prolonged sitting (greater than 1 hour), flexed postures, putting on socks and shoes, and participation in basketball and off-court resistance training. Activities most provoking during sport were re-petitive sprints, intervals of dribbling, and running. Both coughing and straining during resistance exercise aggra-vated his groin symptoms. Short-term relieving factors included relative rest while lying on his back with a pil-low underneath his legs. Past medical history revealed a severe episode of acute low back pain that occurred two years prior when he was 19 years old. At the time, the pain was significant and sidelined him from off-season training and basketball for several weeks. Although he could not recall a specific onset or mechanism of injury, he stated that the acute low back pain began one evening after taking part in a lower body conditioning session that included squats, deadlifts, and interval training. He did not seek any medical atten-tion during the episode of acute low back pain and re-ported that his symptoms subsided with relative rest over several weeks. Since that incident, the patient reported a two-year history of recurrent local, non-radiating low back pain that would present intermittently after rigorous activity. The patient reported no previous imaging, med-ical management, or health concerns other than his recur - rent low back pain. Physical examination revealed an alordotic posture, while gait analysis demonstrated fatigability in left toe and heel walking. Both active and passive lumbar flexion were reduced to 20\u00b0 due to recreation of groin pain and ten-sion in the posterior left limb. All other active, passive and resisted ranges of motion in the lumbar spine and hips were unremarkable. Palpation and resisted muscle testing for the hip musculature on the left was unremarkable and un-able to reproduce the chief complaints. Provocative ortho-paedic testing for the sacroiliac joint, including the thigh thrust, sacral thrust, and both sacroiliac joint compression and distraction tests, were also negative bilaterally. Ac-tive and passive straight leg raise (SLR) were positive at 35\u00b0 on the left with recreation of groin and leg symptoms. Crossed SLR recreated groin and low back pain at 80\u00b0. Palpation revealed hypertonicity in the lumbar paraspin-al with spinous challenge at L3-S1. Motion palpation revealed local painful restriction with rotation and posterior-anterior joint challenge at L2-S1, while Kemp's test caused local pain bilaterally at L3-5. Neurological evaluation for the lower limb revealed weak-ness in left ankle range of motion, as dorsiflexion, plantar flexion and great toe extension were rated 4/5. The left S1 (Achilles) deep tendon reflex was rated 1+ and deemed asymmetric in comparison to the right. Sensory findings were intact and symmetrical for the lower limb.376 J Can Chiropr Assoc 2015; 59(4)A case report involving a posterior ring apophyseal fracture A working diagnosis of a left posterolateral L4-5 disc herniation was made and the patient was referred to his family physician for radiographs given his previous his-tory and current neurological findings. Within two days of the initial examination, results from plain radiographs were taken and read negative for lumbar spine pathology. As such, a conservative plan of management was initi - ated and included a multimodal approach over a 4-week period, 2 times per week. The first two weeks of treat - ment consisted of interferential current (IFC), soft tissue therapy, spinal mobilizations, spinal manipulative ther - apy (SMT), and rehabilitation exercises. As the patient was most comfortable side-lying (left side facing up), IFC was applied to the lumbar spine in this position for 15 minutes at a frequency of 80-150 Hz (continuous) at an amplitude providing a gentle paraspinal muscle con-traction. Following the IFC application, soft-tissue tech - niques were used that involved stretching and mobilizing the paraspinal muscles while the patient remained in the side-lying position. In the first week of treatment, grade II and III segmental lumbar spine mobilizations achieving flexion and rotation were implemented. As treatment ses-sions progressed, side-lying spinal manipulative therapy was applied to the affected segments in the lumbosacral spine. The initial goals of rehabilitation exercises were to centralize the radiating low back pain and facilitate core stability and endurance. Initial rehabilitation exercises in-cluded the McKenzie protocol 11,12 to centralize radicular symptoms. This was utilized in the first two weeks as the patient laid prone and created lumbar extension by lift - ing their chest off the ground with elbows contacting the floor (push up position). Since pain was centralized to the low back with this procedure, the patient was instructed to perform this hourly for 10-15 minutes as tolerated. The patient was also taught abdominal hollowing and core bracing with use of the modified curl-up exercise in the first weeks of treatment. 13 This was performed as the pa- tient was supine with one leg extended (parallel to the floor) while the other was positioned in 45\u00b0 knee flexion and 90\u00b0 hip flexion. 13 The patient was asked to co-contract core musculature in this position via active feedback from the practitioner palpating the abdomen and low back. Education was provided in which the patient was made aware of provocative postures and taught to bend at the hips to avoid flexion of the lumbar spine (hip-hinge). 13 Additionally, he was instructed to modify daily activities, which included avoiding sport until signs and symptoms had resolved. After two weeks the patient only found relief of radicu- lar pain during the McKenzie exercises. As such, the family physician ordered computed tomography (CT) images at the end of the second week. CT images dem-onstrated an intraspinal and extradural mass at the en-trance of the left L5-S1 lateral recess with a focal defect in the vertebral body of L5 (Figure 1). Since the CT im-ages could not differentiate the mass, magnetic resonance Figure 1. Sagittal CT bone window lumbar spine (left) and axial CT bone window of the superior endplate of L5 (right).

J Can Chiropr Assoc Deleo, S Merotto, C Smith, K D'Angelo (MR) imaging and a consult with a spine surgeon was initiated. MR imaging was obtained during the 5th week of treatment and confirmed a large paramedian disc ex-trusion at L4-5 with compression of the left L5 nerve root and posterior displacement of the left S1 nerve root. It also identified an old type III posterior ring apophysis fracture at the superior endplate of L5 (Figure 2). The spine sur - geon had suggested continuing with a conservative plan of management and would monitor his symptoms over the next 8-12 weeks. At 6 weeks, the patient's symptoms began to subside significantly (3/10 on V AS) and he had attributed this to an increased focus on core strengthening and bracing with activity. While soft tissue therapy and SMT continued to be the predominant form of passive therapy, rehabilita - tion exercises had progressed to place more emphasis on maintenance of a neutral spine during dynamic activities, especially those requiring flexion-extension. Exercises included the modified curl-up, front plank, side-bridge, supine gluteal bridge, and bird-dog. 13,14 These exercises were preformed daily at a volume of 2-3 sets with 12-15 repetitions. The front planks and side bridges were per - formed with three repetitions utilizing 45-second holds. Wall squats with an exercise ball placed behind the torso was used to teach the patient active core bracing and maintenance of a neutral spine in a dynamic upright pos-ture. Progressions from this exercise included static sin-gle leg variations to enhance proprioception and balance. At 8 weeks, the patient was able to return to basketball practice as he had no further provocative pain or func-tional issues. Progressive rehabilitation exercises focused on dynamic core stability, endurance, and whole-body strength which included goblet squats, farmer-carries, multi-angle lunges, and standing Pallof presses. Follow-ing weeks of basketball practice and rehabilitation exer - cises with no exacerbation of previous symptoms, he was able to return to game play at 10 weeks. Discussion This case highlights several important issues that can complicate clinical decision making when young adults or adolescents present with discogenic low back pain. Although there is no objective way to measure the con-tribution in which the disc extrusion or existence of an old PRAF had on pain or dysfunction, early detection is essential for optimizing patient management. Therefore, it is necessary for clinicians to recognize the clinical presentation and implement best-practices regarding this pathology for a timely diagnosis and prompt orthopaedic referral. Posterior ring apophyseal fractures most common- ly present in children and adolescents.11 These types of fractures occur almost exclusively with the presence of a single level lumbar disc herniation and are more prevalent in those who are overweight or obese. 6 True incidence is difficult to estimate as these types of fractures are fre-Figure 2.

Complete fusion does not often occur until the ages of 18-25 and can leave the annulus fibrosis of the vertebral body vulnerable to insult. 7 The mean age for those found to have PRAF is 14 years, but the reported range in age is variable from 8 to 69 years. 16 Genetics have also been shown to predispose an individual to this type of injury, as gymnasts with a TT genotype of COL1181 were found to have a higher incidence of PRAF due to the decreased tensile strength of their collagen. 20 Several theories exist regarding the etiology of PRAF, though it is widely thought that age, activity level, and trauma are the main factors that can lead to this injury. 21 Acute macrotrauma has been associated with 30-60% of patients presenting with a PRAF. 22 A fatigue phenomen- on (microtrauma) has also been proposed from repetitive compression and shear stress on the annulus fibrosis. 19,21,22 Some authors have postulated that injuries such as PRAF and pars stress reactions may be due to early sport spe-cialization, as children expose themselves to similar re-petitive motions that chronically load the non-fused struc-tures in the spine. 23 Recent finite element model studies have provided evidence that repetitive stress to the pos-terior ring in extension ultimately weakens the structure, making it more prone to avulsion with tensile loads in flexion. 24,25 Additionally, the material properties of the ossified apophyseal ring is subject to significantly higher stresses than both the adult (fused) and earlier cartilagen - ous models. 24,25 This may explain the higher prevalence of PRAF between the ages of 11-17 years.25 Clinical presentation of PRAF is difficult to differ - entiate from other forms of discogenic low back pain in children, adolescents and young adults. Several compet - ing differential diagnoses are essential to rule out, such as infection in young populations (Table 1). Since PRAF in the lumbar spine most often occurs with a subsequent disc herniation, one must recognize signs and symptoms of pediatric disc herniation. 5,7,9,26 Unlike adults, pediatric disc herniations typically have a prior history of trauma, usually from athletic activity resulting in falls or trauma sustained from heavy lifting. 7,26 Probing the patient for a family history regarding disc herniation has also been suggested due to familial-linked issues in connective tis-sues formation. 7,27 Singhal et al.1 found that 13-57% of pediatric patients with disc herniation have a first degree relative whom also suffers from disc herniation, further suggesting familial predisposition to the condition. A recent review by Wu et al.18 found that the most com- mon signs and symptoms of those suffering from PRAF in-clude paravertebral muscle spasm and tenderness, dimin-ished deep tendon reflexes, sensory loss and motor loss. 18 It has been suggested by some authors that radiculopathy without back pain is the most common symptom. 7 How- ever, Ozgen et al.28 reported that 88% of their adolescent Table 1. Differential diagnoses for PRAF Macro & Microtrauma Pars Stress joint muscular D'Angelo disc herniation patients presented with a chief complaint of low back pain, and just 35% had pain along the L4-S1 dermatomes. Valsalva manoeuvres, forward lumbar flexion, and assessment of bowel and bladder dysfunction for potential complication of Cauda Equina Syndrome (CES) have been indicated as important parts of routine screening for detection of pediatric disc herniation. 7 The literature suggests evaluating for sensory deficit, manual motor testing, deep tendon reflexes, and using the straight leg raise test for detection of a pediatric disc herniation. 7,26 Several authors have presented cases of adolescent PRAF in which patients demonstrated a marked reduction in straight leg raise testing (as minimal as 30\u00b0) with minimal pain accompanying the finding. 16,21,30,31 When PRAF presents in adulthood, physical signs and symptoms are similar to lumbar disc herniation.2,5,17,18,32,33 A recent study found that in adult patients who underwent surgery for lumbar disc herniation and PRAF, 99.1% suf-fered from low back pain and leg pain, 9.8% had bilateral leg pain, and 13.8% of patients demonstrated unilateral leg weakness. 6 In adults, the most common symptoms of lumbar PRAF included low back pain with or without a history of trauma along with radicular pain in one or both legs. 9 It was also suggested that those who suffer from PRAF have greater severity of symptoms than those who suffer from lumbar disc herniation alone. 5,18 Since PRAF is an imaging-dependent diagnosis and that it often presents similar to lumbar disc herniation alone, this injury is easily missed when initial conserv-ative management is effective. When there is concern in the clinical history to warrant imaging, techniques such as radiographs, MRI and CT can all be used to diagnose PRAF. Lateral lumbar radiographs have been shown to detect PRAF at a rate of 79.3%, with a visible wedge-shaped osseous fragment along the posterior corner of the vertebral body. 22 The difficulty with diagnosing PRAF at L5-S1 on plain radiographs occurs from the osseous over - lap of the iliac crest as witnessed in the case presented.17 MRI does not use ionizing radiation and provides a bet-ter evaluation of soft tissue lesions and degree of spinal stenosis. However, small PRAF are often missed on MRI due to low signal intensity. 23 As such, CT is the diagnos- tic study of choice as it has a sensitivity and specificity reaching 100% and is also able to detect PRAF previously missed in plain radiographic and MR studies. 1,6,22,23 T akata et al.34 proposed a classification that is subdivid-ed into three categories based on CT findings. Type I cor - responds to a simple separation of the posterior vertebral margin without bony defect; type II represents a fracture on the posterior margin with avulsion from the vertebral body; and type III consists of a small posterior fracture due to a cartilaginous irregularity of motor plate. 34 An additional class of type IV lesions was developed to de-scribe a complete dislocation of the vertebral body poster - ior wall. 32 Types I, II, and IV lesions are more clinically significant, occur in younger patients, cause more bilat - eral symptoms, and are more likely to be surgical candi - dates.18,22 Type III lesions occur in older adolescents or young adults as most of the ring is fused. These have been shown to be less clinically significant, present unilateral - ly, and both conservative and microsurgical approaches are favoured. 18,22 The patient in our case presented with a type III lesion, suggesting an onset later in adolescence which may have been a factor contributing to success with conservative interventions (Figures 1 and 2). Most often, CT classifications systems categorize lesions based on the size and location of the lesion. Lesions that are large (greater than 50% of the width of the posterior ver - tebral body wall) are more likely to be clinically signifi-cant and surgical candidates. 14 Chang et al.5 reported pa- tients with small central or lateral fragments had excellent results with conservative treatment, while patients with large fragments had poor results. 5,18 Therefore, imaging findings may help the clinician provide more insight to the relative prognosis of the patient or aid in directing ap-propriate conservative management strategies. Currently , there are controversial and contradicting theories to determine whether a patient should receive conservative or operative treatment for PRAF. Wu et al. 18 concluded that indications for surgery include: failed trial of conservative care (6-12 weeks), declines in neurologic - al status, intolerable low back and/or leg pain, severely affected function (ADLs), and any signs of CES. The principles of conservative treatment for PRAF are similar to those for a herniated nucleus pulposus. 23 This includes bed rest, analgesic and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, physical therapy and activity modification with or without lumbar braces. 18,23 However, the duration for at- tempting conservative treatment has not been consistently reported with some trials lasting 6-12 weeks, and there is considerable heterogeneity in baseline patient charac-teristics. 18 Another important consideration in response to 380 J Can Chiropr Assoc 2015; 59(4)A case report involving a posterior ring apophyseal fracture conservative care is age. Children and adolescents have been reported to have less favourable response to con-servative care when they have both PRAF and lumbar disc herniation present. Damage to the annulus fibrosis from trauma, state of the nucleus pulposus, presence of larger osseous fragments, and issues with treatment com-pliance have all been cited. 18 When conservative therapy is ineffective or the patient maintains persistent back pain that adversely compromises daily activities, regardless of neurological deficits, the need for operative treatment has been emphasized. 18,23 The debate whether or not the bony fragment should be removed during surgery has been contentious. One must consider if the existence of the os-seous or disc material alone is responsible for symptom severity. If the fragment is untreated or unrecognized, the fracture could heal with residual bony spinal stenosis. 18 Currently, posterior discectomy with excision of a mo-bile osseous fragment without fusion is the preferred ap-proach. 18 It is important for both the patient and surgeon to consider the associated risks of such procedures which can include dural damage, painful paresthesia, infection, and recurrence of disc herniation. 18 Several case reports involving the chiropractic manage - ment of pediatic and/or adolescent lumbar disc herniation with and without PRAF have been published. 16,21,30,35 De- spite being retrospective case studies, they provide clin - ical insight on how a rare condition can be managed in a chiropractic setting where the literature is scarce. Upon analysis of these reports, many patients presented in the expected mean age of 14 years and all implemented a multimodal approach including spinal manipulation, soft tissue techniques, therapeutic modalities, and rehabilita - tion exercises. Of important note, those patients initially presenting with hard neurological findings (motor weak-ness, atrophy, and loss of deep tendon reflexes) and func-tional limitations were more likely to have failed conserv-ative care and undergo surgery. Those with minimal or no neurological compromise and functional limitations upon initial evaluation responded favourably to conservative care, with complete resolution of symptoms within 2-4 months. On revisiting the case, several key aspects of the pa- tient presentation should have raised concerns and played a role dictating appropriate management. The patient his-tory was critical in this case as it described an inciting event 2 years prior, in which a 2-3 week episode of severe acute low back pain followed a weight training session. Furthermore, this was an event that preceded a 2-year history of recurrent low back pain that was left untreat - ed and undiagnosed. Although speculative, this may have been the development of the initial PRAF lesion as the mechanism of injury and both the classification and age of the fracture (type III) are consistent. Given the age, past medical history, and pain during the initial presenta - tion to the chiropractor, a space occupying lesion and/or fracture such as PRAF is an appropriate differential diag-nosis. As such, this differential diagnosis in conjunction with the presence of hard neurological findings warranted imaging and referral. The overall goals were to reduce and centralize pain, restore mobility, address functional limitations and return the athlete to play. This was accom - plished through a multidisciplinary effort to aid in both the diagnosis and construction of an appropriate conserv-ative plan of management. Addressing functional limita - tions through rehabilitation exercises and patient educa - tion were critical to centralizing symptoms and improving strength, proprioception, and function. As with other in-juries occurring in the skeletally immature lumbar spine, such as pars interticularis fractures, establishing core strength and placing emphasis on lumbopelvic stability are essential to facilitate proper low back loading and may prevent recurrent dysfunction. 13,14 Prior to retuning the athlete to play, care was taken to implement rehab in a sport specific upright posture, focusing on dynamic core stability and perturbation training. Summary PRAF is a condition which is most prevalent in adoles-cent patients and must be considered when these popula-tions present with discogenic symptoms. 2-6 The severity of symptoms are believed to be increased when PRAF is present rather than lumbar disc herniation alone. 5,18 Appreciation for the clinical presentation including pro-gressive symptoms, trauma, repetitive lumbar loading, and patient age are critical to guide appropriate imaging measures to attain the diagnosis of PRAF. Conservative treatment should be initiated first unless red flags are present and include a multimodal approach. 16,21,30,35 Sur- gery is indicated with a failed trial of conservative care (6-12 weeks), declines in neurological status, intolerable low back and/or leg pain, severely affected function, and any signs of CES. 14J Can Chiropr Assoc A, Mitra A, Cochrane D, Steinbok P.

Clinical Features : A 17-year-old, junior baseball pitcher presented with shoulder pain when performing high velocity pitching. Conservative treatment for an assumed soft tissue injury failed to resolve the pain, which was regularly aggravated by pitching, and which subsequently prompted further evaluation, and eventual confirmation of Little Leaguer' s Shoulder on subsequent computerized tomography (CT) imaging. Intervention and Outcome: Prior to pr oper diagnosis, conservative treatment had consisted of activity modification, spinal adjusting, laser therapy, shockwave therapy, Active Release Techniques \u00ae, Kinesiotape,\u00ae and rehabilitation. Later, rehabilitation, consisting of general muscle and core strengthening, continued for a further six months under the supervision of college athletic trainers. The athlete was able to return to normal pitching duties approximately 12 months later. Objectif : D\u00e9crire un cas r\u00e9tablissement.

This condition presents itself in young individuals involved in throw-ing sports such as baseball or javelin. Other synonyms used to describe an injury of this type are epiphyseoly - sis, osteochondrosis, stress fracture, and rotational stress fracture of the epiphyseal plate. 1 According to Binder et al.2 epiphyseal injuries of the proximal humerus are the most common injuries of the shoulder and upper arm in adolescents. Because the proximal humeral epiphysis is responsible for 80% of the humeral growth in length, it is not surprising that this region would be susceptible to damage during the developmental years. The usual age of onset for this condition ranges from 11 to 16 years, with a peak at around 14 years of age. 1,2 The epiphyseal plates will usually close at some point between 20 to 22 years of age. Structurally , the shape of the epiphyseal plate produces an interlocking of the physis and metaphysis of the plate. The thickened periosteum of the epiphysis anchors the head and the tuberosities, while simultaneously strength-ening this region of the shaft; however, that strength is not uniform throughout the entire growth plate. The growth plate is weaker and thinner anteriorly resulting in a great - er incidence of anterior displacement of the distal frag-ment. 3 The physeal injury sustained is primarily a Salter-Har - ris type 1 fracture in which a transverse fracture through the physis separates the epiphysis from the metaphysis. 4 A Salter-Harris 1 fracture occurs in 6% of Salter-Harris fractures.5 According to Hatem et al. it is common to find bone marrow edema in the epiphysis and metaphysis, particularly next to the growth plate. 1 They state that the earliest and most frequent finding is a widened epiphy-seal plate, with less frequent signs of demineralization, sclerosis, fragmentation of the physis, and cystic chan-ges. 1 Additionally, symptoms appear to be dependent on the amount of edema present. The two main mechanisms of proximal humeral injury in adults involve falls onto the shoulder, and falls onto an extended arm in abduc-tion and external rotation. In adolescent baseball pitchers, however, the primary etiology appears to be repetitive throwing, producing significant torque, particularly with breaking pitches. The decreased velocity found in the late cocking or deceleration phases of the throw also plays a role in this type of injury. 6 Following an injury to the epiphysis, various degrees of healing will occur, depending on the length of rest, or, more commonly, the amount of overuse. Unfortunately, many of these injuries are poorly managed, resulting in overuse strain on the growth plate and subsequent irregular and/or partial healing. There are very few validated treat-ment options mentioned in the literature. To date, the best evidence available supports rest for chronic conditions, and pain management for the acute stage. However, given the low level of evidence for most of the interventions, the clinician must also rely on clinical judgement, and experi-ence to treat the condition. The following case presenta-tion describes an example of Little Leaguer's Shoulder, a potentially serious bone injury, which initially masquerad-ed as an uncomplicated musculo-tendinous injury. Summary: In this case, a potentially damaging bone injury masquerading as a simple musculo-tendinous injury cr eated a diagnostic challenge. The patient eventually recovered with rest, time, strengthening, and eventual compliance to prescribed activity modification. (JCCA. 2015; 59(4):383-389) key words: chiropractic, Little r\u00e9tabli avec du repos, du temps, du renforcement et une observance de la des A 17-year-old pitcher presented with sharp shoulder pain of approximately 1-month duration, following a hard throwing session at training. More detailed questioning revealed that the pain actually began several months be-fore during winter training, and that the patient had ex-perienced shoulder pain off and on for several years prior to this recent event. His current pain occurred during the follow-through and deceleration stages of pitching. Sub-maximal throwing did not create any discomfort at the time of the assessment. The patient appeared to be other - wise healthy, and physically fit. Clinical Findings The shoulder pain was located on the posterolateral as-pect of the proximal humerus near the insertion of the deltoid tendon. The patient experienced pain on palpation of this area. Manual testing of the shoulder musculature was painless, revealing functionally strong muscles. Ac-tive and passive shoulder ranges of motion were full and pain-free. His base-line level of pain could not be pro-voked during the examination. Orthopedic tests for im-pingement (Hawkins-Kennedy), instability (apprehen-sion), labral damage (biceps load, load and compression) and musculo-tendinous injury (rotator cuff strength) were also unremarkable. There were no signs of swelling, and palpation did not reveal any abnormal masses. Although there was some loss of joint play, and minor tenderness on palpation of the posterior joints in the cervical and thor - acic spine, it was not considered significant in nature. Diagnostic Focus and Assessment: The initial diagnosis was a musculo-tendinous injury to the deltoid muscle; however, the differential diagnosis in-cluded rotator cuff strain, specifically of the supraspinatus tendon, with or without calcification; biceps tendon in-jury; and referred pain from the cervical spine. Although unlikely, malignant tumors such as osteosarcoma and Ew-ings, and benign tumors in the form of osteoid osteoma and solitary enchondroma were also considered 7. The in- itial diagnosis was based on the presentation of localized pain, aggravated during throwing. The lack of a palpable mass, swelling, or fever, helped somewhat to assuage any concerns about a destructive bone lesion. In the mean - time, several factors made the presence of a bone injury appear to be unlikely, including the patient's ability to painlessly tolerate both significant torsional stresses, and aggressive maneuvering of the humerus during orthoped-ic testing. Additionally, the condition of Little Leaguer's Shoulder is not commonly seen in general Chiropractic practice, even though in retrospect the presence of pain on throwing should have been a red flag. Although the pa-tient's initial palpatory symptoms responded favourably within a week of treatment initiation, (consisting of multi-modal pain management and strengthening exercise), his symptoms continued to recur with hard throwing. Following approximately two months of conservative care, the diagnosis was revised to include the possibil-ity of a more significant bone or epiphyseal plate injury (Little Leaguer's Shoulder). This was confirmed follow-ing a CT scan performed at the University of British Col-umbia sports medicine clinic (see Figure 1). The CT scan described the humeral head growth plate as irregular, possessing both fused and unfused regions with metaphyseal and the epiphyseal overgrowth and re-modeling. There was also curvilinear, ossific fragment arising from the attenuated antero-inferior glenoid. This fragment was thought to be secondary to an impact shear injury, although clinically, it appeared to be asymptom - atic. The findings of growth plate irregularity, and bone overgrowth and remodelling indicated a diagnosis of chronic overuse osteochondrosis (Little Leaguer's Shoul-der). Therapeutic Focus The initial treatment protocol was a multi-modal ap-proach, designed to treat what originally was misdiag - nosed as a musculotendinous injury. The use of shock-wave, although minimally mentioned in the literature for muscle injuries, was used in this case to possibly expedite the healing process due to the chronic nature of the in-jury. 8 In addition, Chiropractic Manipulative treatment, Active Release Technique\u00ae, Low Intensity Laser, and Kinesiotape\u00ae techniques were also utilized. The patient was seen three times during the first week. The treatment protocol for the first visit consisted of Active Release Technique \u00ae to the deltoid, shoulder and scapular muscles. Kinesiotape\u00ae was applied to the shoul- der for muscle support, possibly reducing stress on the joint and muscles. The subsequent visits incorporated shockwave therapy, and laser to the area of deltoid inser - tion. By the third visit the athlete reported significantly de-386 J Can Chiropr Assoc 2015; 59(4)Chronic pain due to Little Leaguer' s Shoulder in an adolescent baseball pitcher: a case report creased point tenderness on palpation. He was instructed to refrain from throwing hard for two to four weeks, and to slowly build up the intensity from easy short throws. The patient received another treatment nine days later after he experienced the same pain in the upper arm fol-lowing a brief pitching appearance, contrary to his re-habilitation instructions to not pitch. He was only able to throw six pitches before the pain forced him to stop. He received two more similar treatments over the next ten days, and was given instructions not to throw for the next week. Following that interval of rest, he was instructed to begin light throwing within a pain-free range. Although the presenting palpatory symptoms seemed to resolve quickly, any harder throwing continued to aggravate the initial injury. This athlete initially underwent a wide variety of treat - ment. In addition, rest, followed by progressive rehabili - tation involving light shoulder exercises, with general strengthening, and a slow progression of throwing were implemented. The coach's, parents, and athlete's expect - ations for a return to play are always high, therefore, it is not unusual to attempt multiple forms of treatment options to heal the injury, and have the athlete return to play as quickly as possible. However, because of this, treatment is often administered contrary to current evidence-based care. At this time, there is little evidence-based research to confirm the use of these treatments, either individual - ly, or as a multi-modal therapy in the treatment of Little Leaguer's Shoulder. After several months of conservative care, the rehabili - tative process of strength and conditioning continued for a further seven months under the supervision of college baseball team trainers. At approximately one year fol-lowing the initiation of treatment, the patient was able to throw pain-free, at full ability. Although the length of time for recovery seems excessive, Hatem et al. point out that in their experience it is not unusual for some cases to take seven months to a year to resolve 1. DiscussionThis case would have been challenging to any clinician unfamiliar with an injury such as Little Leaguer's Shoul-der, because the athlete was able to play a collision sport, encountering repeated contact, as well as forceful dis-traction to the arm, without experiencing the pain that re-sulting from throwing hard. The patient's ability to play a high-impact sport simply highlights the fact that Little Leaguer's Shoulder is but one example of a sport-related Figure 1A. The blue arrow points to the irregular epiphyseal plate, the red arrow point to an ossific fragment. Figure 1B. The blue arrow points to Chiropr Assoc 2015; 59(4) 387D Wasylynko injury with a highly specific mechanism of injury (high velocity throwing in this case), which may not be pro-voked, or even painful, during alternate (non-throwing) types of activities, even when those activities involved high-impact forces through the shoulder. On a related note, this patient was also able to consistently perform strength and conditioning routines, albeit with light - er weights, and stretch tubing for maintaining general strength in the shoulder muscles. There is some support for the treatment of tendon and bone injuries with shockwave therapy, possibly creating another direction of treatment for the management of epi-physeal fractures. 9 Active Release Techniques\u00ae, a well-es- tablished soft tissue technique for the treatment of muscles and tendons, was also utilized, although current evidence for its use tends to be more anecdotal. 10,11 Low Intensity Laser has been used clinically for many decades to treat bone, muscle, tendon and ligament injuries, however, there is mixed support in the literature. 12,13 The lack of sol- id evidence may be due to the many different types of laser devices commonly used, and the variation in dose and fre-quency, creating a problem with uniformity when inves-tigating the treatment's validity for different conditions. The application of Kinesiotape \u00ae, and similar products have mixed reviews in the literature for shoulder injuries, however, it seems to be a treatment that has some degree of benefit for muscle pain, albeit the evidence may often be anecdotal. 14,15 Chiropractic manipulative therapy was administered to the restricted cervical and thoracic spine segments. The anatomical and functional connections of these joints can, at times, account for a referred pain pat-tern to the shoulder from the cervicothoracic spine. 16 According to Popkin et al.17 examination findings of Little Leaguer's Shoulder often include \"tenderness on the antero-lateral proximal humerus as well as pain and weakness with resisted shoulder abduction and internal and external rotation\". The examination findings were quite different in this case, as evidenced by postero-lateral pain, and no muscle weakness in any ranges of motion. This could possibly be explained by the chronic nature of the condition. Shanley and Thigpen 18 state that \"the clin - ical examination of these athletes is not often definitive, and diagnosis must be confirmed through imaging stud-ies\". This opinion is also shared by Frick and Hilgers 19 who maintain that radiographs are very useful in the diag-nosis of Little Leaguer's Shoulder. When an adolescent baseball pitcher presents with upper arm/shoulder pain, the clinician should always consider the diagnosis of Little Leaguer's Shoulder. Un-fortunately, this diagnosis may be commonly missed in chiropractor's offices due to a lack of familiarity with the condition, potentially resulting in extended damage to the growth plate, and a prolonged symptomatic picture. In this particular case, the signs, symptoms, and limited re-covery did eventually point in the direction of an epiphy-seal injury. The initial diagnosis could have been some-what difficult for the general chiropractic practitioner due to a number of factors: 1) the athlete's ability to continue playing a physical contact sport, 2) the lack of discomfort with an aggressive physical examination, 3) the ability to tolerate vibration of the bone tissue during shockwave therapy, and 4) a somewhat unusual symptom pattern in terms of pain. However, in retrospect, none of these fac-tors precludes a differential diagnosis of Little Leaguer's Shoulder. Y oung baseball pitchers are particularly susceptible to injuries of the proximal humeral epiphysis due to rota-tional and distractive stresses on the proximal humerus. Early sports specialization and excessive training of young athletes is a common problem, creating an ever-increas-ing risk of overuse injuries. This is particularly evident if baseball pitchers are poorly coached, and continuously utilize poor throwing mechanics. The harder throws and more variable types of pitches add significant stress to the shoulder girdle. In addition, higher pitch counts and in-nings thrown, in combination with a longer season, creates an environment for overuse stresses to the growth plate. Injury biomechanics Sabick et al. 20 state that over the course of time, the high torque created late in arm cocking, provides a shear stress, with the resultant deformation of the epiphyseal cartilage and humeral retro-torsion. Immature growth plates tend to be associated with increased joint laxity, and under - developed musculature, creating a situation where the growth plate must bear the brunt of the imposed forces, which ultimately stresses the bone, creating injury. This becomes more apparent during a growth spurt, where strength and flexibility become imbalanced, ultimately re-sulting in a growth plate that is weaker than the ligaments and muscles around it. This weakness may then lead to epiphyseal injury. At the end of the arm-cocking phase, 388 J Can Chiropr Assoc 2015; 59(4)Chronic pain due to Little Leaguer' s Shoulder in an adolescent baseball pitcher: a case report significant internal rotational stresses are placed prox- imal to the growth plate by the subscapularis, latissimus dorsi, and pectoralis major muscles, while at the same time external stresses are placed on the distal humerus by the forearm and hand. The result of these two different directions of torque creates a net external rotation of the distal humerus, and damaging shearing force between the epiphysis and metaphysis. Over time, this may create the development of humeral retrotorsion that can be seen in professional pitchers. 20 Although the true incidence of Little Leaguer's Shoul- der is not accurately known, the increase in training in-tensity with youth baseball, could likely result in far more frequent occurrences of this injury. As this case demon-strates, shoulder pain in an adolescent pitcher may be indicative of a significant injury. The literature is mixed when it comes to recommending the most effective method of treatment for this particular condition. Hatem et al. 1 state that the decision to return to play should be based on clinical rather than radiographic factors. Numerous authors concur that the best course of treatment involves rest, ice, physiotherapy, and gradual throwing progression. They also feel the athlete should refrain from pitching for two to three months while under - going a strengthening program, and correction of throw-ing mechanics. 2, 17,19 It also appears that there is general agreement among clinicians that a slow return to throwing at low intensity is an appropriate recommendation. 2,6,17,19 Therapy should consist of rotator cuff strengthening, pos-terior shoulder capsule stretches, and core strengthening and stretching. However, Hatem et al. 1 feel that the athlete could return to play within three months with a gradual throwing program, and do not see a need for any physical therapy. Carson and Gasser 4 state that the athlete could re- turn to gradual throwing when symptoms have subsided, usually at around three months, and advance the throwing as tolerated. They also did not utilize physical therapy, and stated that several patients had actually become worse with strengthening exercises. It appears that the stage of injury may be important when designing a treatment pro-gram, utilizing a slower approach in the acute phase, with the addition of therapeutic modalities. 21 Based on the existing literature, and results of this case, it appears the common ground resides with rest for at least two to three months. The use of any therapy would be on a case-to-case basis, but there does not appear to be any definitive evidence that supports the use of therapeutic modalities, unless in an acute stage to reduce inflamma - tion and pain 14, however, a progressive protocol of throw- ing with a structured rehabilitation program is important, emphasizing the need to avoid exacerbation of symptoms. The need to maintain strength and flexibility following injury is also important, therefore, progressive strength-ening exercises are useful, particularly in combination with an extended period of time away from usual training. As with progressive throwing, strength training should be advanced at a slow pace with a view towards maintaining an asymptomatic state, and utilizing commonly accepted principles and stages of rehabilitation. Shanley and Thig-pen 18 outline a return to play rehabilitation schedule start- ing with a cessation of throwing, modalities to remove inflammation and support healing tissue, then a progres-sion to promoting functional motion and endurance. The final stage involves sport-specific strength protocols, and pain free activity. Summary Although Little Leaguer's Shoulder may not be a condi-tion readily found in the average Chiropractor's office, its low incidence could possibly be due to unfamiliarity with the injury. In addition, the lack of direction from physical examination, and significant movement specificity related to the nature of this condition, indicates the limitations of physical findings in this particular condition. Little Leaguer's Shoulder should be suspected in all adolescent athletes who experience refractory shoulder pain, and are involved in throwing sports. This is particu - larly true if there is no history of a traumatic event, and the pain can be easily localized to the proximal humerus. Suspicion of this injury should be followed up with plain x-rays and a CT scan if needed. Treatment is somewhat variable but will require at least 2 to 3 months of rest, and a progression of asymptomatic throwing. Treatment will depend on whether the condition is acute or chronic, as well as the severity of injury. Future research is needed to better understand the optimal combination of therapy, and length of rest, during the various stages of bone healing.

Clinical Features: A professional hockey player with recurrent groin pain presented to the clinic after an acute exacerbation of pain while playing hockey. Intervention: The patient r eceived a clinical diagnosis of inguinal disruption. Imaging revealed a tear in the Objectif : Pr\u00e9senter la prise en charge clinique d'une perturbation l'importance que rev\u00eat une approche multidisciplinaire diagnostic la prise en charge. de la douleur survenue au cours de la pratique de son sport. Intervention : Le patient a re\u00e7u un diagnostic clinique d'une Groin pain is a common complaint in athletes. It is esti-mated that approximately 5% to 18% of all sports injuries are groin-related. 1 How many of these injuries are athletic pubalgia is unclear, due to the lack of consistent diagnos-tic criteria proposed in the literature. Unfortunately, the majority of research in this area are retrospective studies, non-randomised studies, case-controlled studies, and case reports. 2,3 This may be due to the vast amount of disagree- ment in the literature regarding the diagnosis, pathophysi-ology, and treatment options. The terminology for this injury is still controversial. Arguably, the most commonly used term is Sports Hernia (SH). This term is a misnomer and misleading. The condi-tion does not involve a true hernia and it may also present in a non-athletic population. Other terms that have been used in the literature are: pubic 2-6 The term Athletic Pubalgia (AP) has also been used interchangeably with SH in the literature. AP can also be deemed a misnomer since it implies that the injury only takes place in athletes. However, there are some sources that describe AP as an injury to the many musculotendin - ous structures that cross the anterior pelvis, such as the rectus abdominis Hernia Society's 2014 position statement based on the Manchester Consensus Conference proposed eliminating the various terms such as athletic pubalgia, sports hernia, sportsman's groin, pubic inguinal pain syn-drome, etc., and to replace them with the preferred term Inguinal Disruption (ID). 6 The term ID is thought to de- scribe the condition more accurately. The consensus state-ment reports that this injury includes posterior inguinal wall weakness (this area represents a combination of the transversalis fascia and the parietal peritoneum), exter - nal conjoint tendon damage and tears in the inguinal ligament. It was noted that not all of these fea-tures are present in every case, and that other pathologies involving the muscle, ligaments and joints may also be rectus abdominis. Management included two platelet-rich plasma (PRP) injections to the injured tissue, and subsequent manual therapy and exercise. The patient returned to his prior level of performance in 3.5 weeks. Discussion: This case demonstrated the importance of a multidisciplinary team and the need for advanced imaging in athletes with groin pain. Summary: Research quality concerning the non- surgical management of inguinal disruption remains low. This case adds evidence that PRP , with the addition of manual therapy and exercise may serve as a relatively quick and effective non-surgical management strategy.

Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) injections have recently gained attention in the treatment of sports injuries. The rationale behind PRP is that there would be enhancement of the natural healing process if additional growth fac-tors were introduced into the damaged tissue. 10,11 There is evidence that these growth factors are needed in muscle repair and regeneration process. 11 Our case describes the non-surgical management of ID due to a tear of the rectus abdominis and conjoint tendon. This case demonstrates the importance of a multidisci - plinary approach to diagnosis and co-management. Case Presentation A 31-year-old male professional hockey player presented to a sports chiropractor after an acute exacerbation of lower abdominal pain. Two weeks prior to presentation, he was experiencing a feeling that he described as a tight groin and hip flexor, which responded well to stretching and warm-up but would tighten up quickly with skating. He described receiving soft tissue therapy from the team athletic trainer on the lower abdominal region, which seemed to temporarily ease the tension. During a practice session just prior to presentation to the clinic, he executed a slap shot and immediately felt a sharp pain above the pubic symphysis and along the left inguinal ligament. The pain forced him to discontinue skating and practice. He stated he had pain with walking, straining and coughing with a general ache at rest. He received an MRI that night which revealed a tear in the left rectus abdominis, rec-tus sheath and a portion of the conjoint tendon. The team physician recommended surgery based on the MRI find-ings. The player decided to get a second opinion from a sports chiropractor. Upon presentation to the sports chiropractor , the pa- tient indicated a general feeling of tightness through the left lower abdominal region and left anterior/medial thigh, and a sharp pain just superior to the pubic sym-physis slightly left of midline. Physical examination revealed sharp local pain on pal- pation the hip range of motion was unremarkable. Lumbar spine range of motion was within normal range. Patellar, hamstring and Achilles tendon reflexes were 2+ bilateral - ly. Sensory examination was unremarkable. Straight leg raise was normal. Resisted hip adduction was graded 3/5 with inguinal pain. Resisted sit-up was positive for weak-ness and inguinal pain. Valsalva's maneuver produced in-guinal pain. The patient received a working diagnosis of ID, as per the criteria in Table 1. The patient was subsequently referred to a sports phys- ician. Diagnostic ultrasound imaging revealed a left rec-tus abdominis tear at the insertion on the pubic tubercle and a tear of a portion of the left conjoint tendon. The tear measured 12.6mm x 4.4mm. The patient was treated with Table 1. Diagnostic criteria of Inguinal Disruption 6 Clinical diagnosis of Inguinal Disruption (ID) can be made if 3 of the following 5 signs are present: 1 Pinpoint tenderness over the pubic tubercle at the point of insertion of the conjoint tendon 2 Palpable tenderness over the deep inguinal ring 3 Pain and/or dilation of the external ring with no obvious hernia evident4 Pain at the origin of the adductor longus tendon5 Dull, diffused pain in the groin, often radiating to the perineum and inner thigh or the ultrasound-guided PRP injection (Figure 1). One week later, the tear measured 4.6mm x 2.6mm. A second PRP injection was administered (Figure 2). At this point, he was referred back to the sports chiropractor and a strength and conditioning coach to commence rehabilitation. T reatment by the sports chiropractor was performed daily and included myofascial release to the quadriceps, in order to normalise the abnormal muscle tension crossing the anterior pelvis. Care was taken not to treat directly over the torn site. Due to the fact that the tear was still maturing, manual therapy over the injection site may have disrupted the regenerative process of PRP, potentially negating its effectiveness. Exercises were supervised by a strength and condi - tioning coach. The exercises were performed daily and included 2 sets of 15 repetitions of: transversus abdominis setting, monster walks with a blue theraband, high hurdle steps, walking lunges with overhead reach, hip airplanes, one leg squat with opposite leg towel slide and bowler squats (Figures 3-9). The goal of the exercises was to strengthen the muscles crossing the anterior pelvis. As his pain decreased, the player gradually transitioned back to hockey. At the end of week two, the player began skating lightly. A few days later, he began shooting drills. At the start of week three, he participated in full prac-tice with the team and resumed training with his hock-ey team's strength and conditioning coach. Full return to play occurred in the middle of week three. The player was asymptomatic at return to play and remains asymptomatic at six months follow-up. Discussion This case describes the non-surgical management of ID due to a rectus abdominis and conjoint tendon tear. The injury occurred in the player's pre-season training and Figure 2.

One leg squat with opposite leg towel slide therefore a timely recovery and return-to-play was of ut-most importance to him. High quality evidence regard-ing athletic pubalgia is lacking. Only a few case reports and case series demonstrate successful treatment of ID by purely non-surgical means. 4,9,12,13 The majority of the lit- erature concur that treatment by surgery more often leads to favorable outcomes compared to non-surgical manage -ment alone. 2,3,14 Currently, there is only one case report that has shown successful treatment of ID with PRP.8 EtiologyThe exact etiology of ID is under debate. Meyers has de-scribed the relationship between the rectus abdominis and the adductor longus and how they play a crucial role in Can Chiropr Assoc 2015; 59(4) 395E St-Onge, pelvis.15-17 The rectus abdom- inis provides a supero-posterior tension, while the adduct - ors provide an infero-anterior tension to the anterior pel- vis.16 Motions such as repetitive hip hyperabduction and lumbar hyperextension, a movement commonly seen in sports, can induce sheering at the pubic symphysis and may lead to a tear or series of microtears of the rectus abdominis muscle or tendon as it inserts onto the pubis. 4,17 Cadaveric dissections have shown that when the rectus abdominis is cut, the pelvis tilts anteriorly. 15 This finding may suggest that muscle balance is altered in these ath-letes and this may be the start of a cascade of events that lead to ID. 15,17 Meyers performed surgery to strengthen the anterior pelvic floor and reported a 95% success rate via his surgical method. 15 T ypical presentation of a patient with ID will be a young athletic male who plays a sport that involves run-ning while changing directions, twisting, skating and kicking. 2,3,18 The most common sports are soccer, rugby, football and hockey.2,4 They will describe an insidious onset of deep lower abdominal and/or groin pain that is exacerbated with sporting activity, coughing or straining. 2 DiagnosisGroin pain is common among athletes. Anatomically speaking, the groin represents a complex confluence of structures. There are multiple anatomical structures that, when injured, may present as groin pain. 2,3,9,15,18 Between 27% and 90% of athletes who present with symptoms of ID may have multiple pathologies, thus examination may require a multidisciplinary approach. 2,3 Considering the vast differential diagnosis for groin pain, ID is con-sidered a diagnosis of exclusion 2,3,13,18,19 and can only be confirmed by endoscopic examination. 4,20 Differentials of injury, sprain nerve entrapment/neuropathy, stress fracture, osteoarthritis and referred pain from vis-cera. 2,3,6,18 It has been proposed that diagnostic imaging is mainly used to rule out other causes of groin pain. 2,18,21,22 MRI typ- ically reveals non-specific findings in patients with ID.19 The main findings are bone marrow edema and increased signal of the rectus abdominis/adductor aponeurosis. 6,23 A dynamic ultrasound may also be used to assess the integ - rity of the posterior inguinal wall while having the patient strain.2,6 If weakened, the posterior inguinal wall will dis- place anteriorly rather than remain taut.2 The sensitivity for this test is 100%, however the specificity is 0%.24,25 It should be noted that this particular phenomenon is often present in asymptomatic athletes, and thus these findings should be clinically correlated. 6,26 The gold standard to detect posterior inguinal wall deficiencies is surgical ex-ploration. 24 A recent consensus statement on ID proposed a set of criteria to aid in the diagnosis of ID (see Table 1). 6 The validity and reliability of these criteria are unknown at this time. Further studies should be conducted to evaluate these criteria. It was also noted that all other causes of groin pain must be excluded. 6 In our presented case, 3 of the 5 criteria were met (numbers 1, 4, and 5). Once the diagnosis of ID is made, a trial of conservative care lasting six to eight weeks should commence.2,4,6,12,27 Non-surgical ManagementThere are several case reports/series that describe a pro-posed rehabilitation protocol for ID. Woodward et al 12 de- scribed a 3-phase rehabilitation protocol of a professional hockey player with the signs and symptoms of ID. Phase 1 (4 days) focused on pain management. Phase 2 (14 days) focused on strength and stability. Phase 3 (31 days) focused on functional progression and return to sport. Treatment lasted a total of 49 days. The athlete was able to return to play without recurrence of these symptoms for the following 8 seasons. Y uill et al4 reported the non-surgical management (a combination of manual therapy and rehabilitation exer - cises) of two high-level and one recreational soccer play-er with ID. Manual therapy for all three patients occurred one to two times per week for six to eight weeks in total, and included soft tissue therapy, laser, microcurrent, elec - tro-acupuncture, and wobenzyme. Rehabilitation exercis - es were performed three times per week for eight weeks and progressed from strengthening, to functional, to sport specific. All three athletes were able to return to play after eight weeks of treatment without recurrence of symptoms at two years follow-up. There were similarities between the exercises used in our presented case and the previous cases. All programs included exercises that strengthened and stabilized the muscles that cross the anterior pelvis. However, in our case, the player returned to play in much less time. This 396 J Can Chiropr Assoc 2015; 59(4)Multidisciplinary approach to non-surgical management of inguinal disruption in a professional hockey player can be due to any combination of the PRP injection, manual therapy and exercises. Surgery A recent systematic review by Serner et al concluded that there is moderate evidence (evidence provided by one high-quality study and/or two or more low-quality studies and by generally consistent findings in all stud-ies) suggesting that surgery results in better treatment success than non-surgical treatment. 1 Surgery should be considered if a trial of conservative care has failed.2,6 The two sur gical approaches to treat ID are the open (anterior) approach and the laprascopic (posterior) ap-proach, and there are various methods within each. 2,6,22 Favourable outcomes are reported in 63% to 97% of cases for both relief of symptoms and return to previous levels of sport activity. 2,6 It should be noted that there are currently no stud-ies that directly compare the various surgical methods. 6 There is no clear recommendation as to which method is most appropriate and it is largely determined by the level of the surgeon's experience and expertise of a particular technique. 6 The goal of surgery, independent of the type of surgery used, is to normalize any abnormal tension sur - rounding the injured tissue (often including an adductor tenotomy). 2,6 Platelet-Rich PlasmaPlatelet-rich plasma (PRP) has gained interest in the treat - ment of sport injuries. 10 PRP is prepared by collecting a blood sample from the subject. The sample is then put in a centrifuge to separate the platelets from the rest of the sample; this platelet portion is then injected into the injured tissue. 10,28,29 Platelets can release several growth factors which may promote tissue healing.10,28,29 In our case, the sports physician decided to inject PRP into the rectus abdominis tear. The patient was informed of the treatment plan and gave consent to treatment. The PRP was prepared using the Angel Hematocrit Setting. A sample of 10mL of blood was drawn in preparation for each injection. A 7% hematocrit setting was used. This method yields a 5.4-fold increase in platelet concentra - tion. There is currently a lack of standardization regarding PRP preparation.28 As a result, it is difficult to conclude efficacy of PRP across the literature due to the heterogen - eity of the PRP preparation.10,29 In the author's (AMG) experience, the Angel Hematocrit Setting has resulted in good results and was used in this particular case. A recent case report by Scholten et al reported the treat - ment of a lacrosse player with ID due to a distal rectus abdominis tendinopathy. 8 This patient was treated with one injection of PRP into the left distal rectus abdominis muscle. At four weeks post injection, the patient had no pain or tenderness at the pubic symphysis on palpation. At week six, the player was cleared for sport-specific train - ing and modified practice. At eight weeks, the player re-turned to his normal level of performance prior to injury. Post-PRP injection, it is recommended to introduce a rehabilitation programme as a synergist to repair and remodel the injured tissue. 11 Loading of the tissue (via manual therapy and exercise) leads to upregulation of mechanogrowth factor, leading to activation of satellite cells, which in turn improves the alignment of the re-generating myotubes. 11,30 In our case, the patient was re- ferred by the sports physician to the sports chiropractor and the strength and conditioning specialist. The goal of the manual therapy performed by the sports chiroprac - tor included normalizing the abnormal muscular tension across the anterior pelvis. The goal of the strength and conditioning specialist was to strengthen the musculature of the anterior pelvis. Both manual therapy and exercise contributed to loading of the tissue and subsequent cellu - lar processes as described above. Summary The scientific literature regarding the conservative management of ID are currently limited to retrospective studies, non-randomised studies, case-controlled studies and case reports. 2,3 There is still disagreement in the lit- erature regarding the pathophysiology of ID.2 It includes any combination of injuries to posterior wall, conjoint oblique musculature, etc. 2-4,6,19,27 There is a need for higher quality studies regarding non-surgical intervention for ID. ID is common in sports involving running, kicking and twisting motions. We reported a case of a professional hockey player who was non-surgically treated with PRP, chiropractic, and rehabilitation exercises with a relatively quick recovery in 3.5 weeks.

Caract\u00e9ristiques cliniques : Un gardien de but de hockey sur glace \u00e0 la retraite de 22 ans a consult\u00e9 Introduction Femoroacetabular impingement (FAI) is a mechanism that clinically leads to pain and has been associated with several intra-articular injuries including acetabular labral tears and early-onset osteoarthritis of the hip. 1-3 The morphological characteristics associated with FAI have helped define subtypes that include cam impingement when there is overgrowth of the femoral head; when the and a combined impingement involv-ing both cam and pincer characteristics. 1,2,4 Diagnostic imaging is necessary to confirm the presence and sever - ity of the deformity and is used to predict symptomatic impingement. 5 The alpha angle is used quantitatively to evaluate the degree of femoral head deformity for cam-type FAI, while evaluation of acetabulum morphology allows for the determination of pincer-type FAI (Figure 1). 5-7 A review by Emary8 highlights these pertinent radio- graphic findings in a clinical context for use in chiroprac - tic practice. There is a growing body of evidence to suggest that F AI may be more prevalent in athletes, specifically sports which require end-range movements of hip flexion, ad-duction, and internal rotation. 9,10 Although involvement in sport was once thought to merely expose or self-se-lect those with these congenital anomalies, increasing evidence has suggested these lesions may be due to sport-specific acquired adaptations over time. 9 Given the demands of the sport, ice hockey players are particularly susceptible to symptomatic FAI, with the cam and com-bined deformity being the two most common subtypes. 9-12 Furthermore, hockey goaltenders are exposed to a series of unique mechanical positions, particularly movements utilized in the butterfly technique, which may increase their risk of FAI. 9 The butterfly style for ice hockey goal- tenders is popular, especially with younger, developing players. It is defined as a technique where the goaltend - er drops to their knees and internally rotates the hips to 90\u00b0 with the intention of guarding the bottom portion of the net. 9,13,14 Recently, there has been much interest and controversy surrounding this topic with respect to pos-ition-specific demands in ice hockey players. There has electroacupuncture and rehabilitation exercises were implemented . Summary: F AI is prevalent in ice hockey players, particularly with goaltenders. Both skating and position-dependent hip joint mechanics involved in ice hockey may exacerbate or contribute to acquired and congenital forms of symptomatic F AI. As such, practitioners managing this population must address sport-specific demands in manual therapy, rehabilitation and physical training, to improve functional outcomes and prevent future injury.

With respect to positions, these injuries present more frequently in goaltenders in com-parison to both forwards and defencemen. 14 Since ice hockey is a Canadian national sport and it is common for clinicians to treat this population, there must be an increased awareness of sport-specific movements and injury patterns to optimize patient management. It is therefore critical to understand the pathomechanics at work and apply these principles to patient care, such as physical therapy and rehabilitation. The purpose of this case report is to detail the presentation of a male com-petitive hockey goaltender with symptomatic cam-type FAI and subsequent labral tears. This case will explore FAI with specific emphasis on athletes and ice hockey players, outlining the prevalence, clinical presentation, and management options. It will also expand on the im-portance of understanding sport-specific biomechanics to employ a thorough, non-surgical approach to aid in the treatment in FAI cases. Case Presentation A 22-year old male retired Ontario Junior Hockey (OHL) goaltender presented to a chiropractor at a sports clinic after being advised by an orthopaedic surgeon to seek conservative management for his symptomatic FAI. The patient had a 4-year history of recurrent left hip pain that had forced him to retire from competitive play. Six-months prior to presenting to the sports clinic, an ortho-paedic surgeon had diagnosed him with left chondral flap and longitudinal acetabular labral tears with morphologic features of a cam-type femoroacetabular impingement (Figures 2-3). The patient was told he was not a surgical Figure 1. T1-weighted coronal (left) and axial (right) MR images of the left hip.

Furthermore, the patient was apprehensive to undergo sur - gery due to time constraints and fear of complications. As a result, the patient made a career choice to leave the sport of hockey and pursue further education to preserve future hip function. Since his left hip pain started to complicate other activities of daily living, such as long sitting and jogging, he felt that physical therapy was now warranted. The pain was described as a local, deep dull sensation that would present with intermittent bouts of sharp pain and catching that could radiate into the proximal anteromed - ial thigh. The pain was rated a 7/10 on a visual analogue scale (V AS) and his medical history revealed previous bilateral adductor strains and a left shoulder dislocation. When asked about his goals, the patient wanted to allevi - ate his consistent hip pain and improve his function for daily activities. He felt that he would never be able to play ice hockey competitively again considering the reported 'damage' to his left hip, but his ability to play at some level in the future was a long-term goal. Physical examination revealed a 20% limitation and pain in both active and passive hip flexion and internal rotation. There was pain on palpation in several left hip girdle muscles, most notably the distal capsular portion of Figure 2.

Resisted left hip flexion and adduction were rated 4/5 with manual muscle testing (MMT), in which the patient was asked to meet the applied force of the practitioner at a fixed pos-ition. 15,16 Left hip abduction was rated 5/5 using the same MMT technique with pain reported during sustained con-traction. 16 The hip scour and flexion-adduction-internal rotation (FADIR or FADDIR) tests3,17 recreated the chief complaint, produced a palpable non-painful click, and had a hard end-feel. The left FABER (flexion-abduction-ex - ternal rotation) test was positive, in which the vertical dis-tance from the lateral knee to the examination table was increased on the symptomatic hip in comparison to the unaffected hip. 3 When the concurrent battery of testing is positive, clinical anterior hip impingement should be considered with a heightened suspicion for intra-articular hip pathology (including FAI). 17 Active straight leg raise (SLR), lumbar Kemp's, thigh thrust, and both sacroiliac joint compression and distraction tests were negative. Painful restriction was noted locally at the right sacroiliac joint with posterior-anterior joint challenge. Hip log roll, hip axial loading, resisted trunk flexion (sit-up), and val-salva tests were negative. These tests were implemented to rule out competing differential diagnoses (Table 1). In addition to the imaging-confirmed diagnosis provid- ed by the orthopaedic surgeon, a clinical diagnosis of left anterior hip impingement with associated tendinopathies of the left hip flexors and adductors was rendered. Treat-ment consisted of a conservative multimodal approach to address the secondary neuromusculoskeletal deficits associated with the underlying intra-articular hip joint pathology. The goals of the plan of management were to decrease pain, improve hip function (i.e. range of motion, strength, endurance, proprioception), and build more ac-tive lumbopelvic stability to allow participation in sport. The treatment was delivered at a frequency of 1-2 times per week over a 6-week period. Active Release Technique (ART)\u00ae and instrument-assisted soft tissue therapy was directed to the affected muscles and fascial planes. Spinal manipulative therapy was used to improve the range of motion and affect the overlying tissues of the right sac-roiliac joint to optimize lumbopelvic function. Hip cap-sule distraction and release was delivered to the affected left hip using the Mulligan Mobilizations with Movement (MWM) concept. 18 Contemporary medical electroacu - puncture was also incorporated into the plan of manage - ment. Spinal inputs included L2-L5 bilaterally and local inputs to the left hip muscles and nerves (SP-12, LR-10, GB-29, BL-53, BL-54) at a low (2 Hz) frequency stimu-lation. Rehabilitation exercises were used to increase muscle coordination, strength, endurance, and improve lumbopelvic stability. These were implemented in pro-gressive phases: neuromuscular facilitation, functional training and sport specific training (Table 2). After 6 weeks of treatment (total of 8 treatments) the patient was pain free at rest, during daily activities (in-cluding exercise), and with all stress tests used in the initial physical exam. Despite having less pain, the hip scour and FADIR tests still provided a hard end-feel and palpable click at extreme ROM. The patient was able to complete more taxing, sport-specific rehabilitation that incorporated both complex movement patterns and explo-sive plyometric training. At 8 weeks the patient was able to return to the ice with no further hip pain in a men's rec-reational hockey league at a frequency of once per week. Currently, he plays for 2 competitive men's hockey teams in both the winter and summer seasons at a frequency of 3 games per week. Although the underlying hip morphol-ogy and acetabular labral tears are irreversible with con-servative care, this case demonstrates the importance of Table 1.

Jung et al. 20 retrospectively examined anterior-posterior (AP) pelvic CT scout views of 419 ran-domly selected patients, looking for the prevalence of cam-type deformity and evaluating alpha angle measurements. Among asymptomatic adults, 215 male hips were assessed revealing 13.5% as pathological, 14.88% as borderline and 71.16% as normal. Among 204 asymptomatic female hip joints, 5.56% were pathological, 6.11% were borderline, and 83.33% were deemed normal. 20 Hack et al.21 further demonstrated that in asymptomatic volunteers with no pri-or hip issues, 28% showed either a cam deformity or an elevated alpha angle, predisposing them to FAI. F AI has been anecdotally reported to have a higher in- cidence in athletic populations compared to non-athletic populations. FAI is reported with an estimated prevalence of 24% to 67% in asymptomatic athletes. 22,23 In comparing a group of 22 semi-professional soccer players to 22 ama-teur soccer players, it was found that the semi-professional group had a significantly higher mean alpha angle, which predisposes impingement. 23 In a systematic review and meta-analysis it was found that high-level male athletes (participating in basketball, soccer, hockey, and running) are 1.9 to 8.0 times more likely to develop a cam-type deformity than male controls. 24 While many studies have reported on male athletes, it is important to distinguish the prevalence of FAI in female athletes due to their unique hip anatomy. Kapron et al. 25 analyzed 63 female collegiate athletes who participated in volleyball, soccer, and track and field, assessing for radiographic evidence of FAI. Cam-type deformities were found in 48% of all hips with track and field athletes having significantly higher alpha angles compared to soccer and volleyball athletes. 25 Additionally, several main sexual dimorphisms have been observed with FAI, in which males are significantly more likely than fe-males to have both radiographic and symptomatic bilateral cam-type FAI. 26 Other differences include smaller alpha angles and greater hip anteversion observed in females with symptomatic FAI. Despite these morphological dif-ferences, it has been demonstrated clinically that subject-ive hip function outcome scores are lower in females with symptomatic FAI in comparison to male counterparts. 26 W ith specific reference to hockey players, Ayeni et al. 11 demonstrated that elite ice hockey players had sig- nificantly greater alpha angles than non-athletes. Even some of the youngest hockey players when compared to skiers of the same age (10-18 years) showed significantly greater alpha angles, and were 4.5 times more likely to have an alpha angle associated with cam impingement. 12 Siebenrock et al.27 further displayed that elite-level youth hockey players had greater alpha angles with a closed femoral physes versus open physes, as well as higher al-pha angles in symptomatic athletes when compared to asymptomatic counterparts. In addition, Ross et al. 13 re- vealed that 90% of butterfly goaltenders had an elevated alpha angle greater than 50\u00b0, resulting in a higher preva-lence of FAI when compared to positional players. As is the focus of this case study, athletes appear to have a higher prevalence of FAI, and specifically hockey play-ers, even at young ages, show a higher prevalence of FAI than participants in other sports. While the exact caus-ation for such prevalence cannot be attributed to sports participation alone, it is important for the clinician to be aware of these differential diagnoses for persistent hip pain in these populations. Clinical Presentation and Imaging The literature describing clinical history and physical examination findings in patients with FAI is limited with considerable heterogeneity in population characteristics. Considering the vast amount of competing injuries that can occur at the hip, specifically in athletes such as ice hockey players, several important differential diagno-ses must be evaluated and ruled out (Table 1). Patients with FAI will often present with groin pain, pain with prolonged sitting or walking, and pain during athletic ac-tivities requiring end-range motion, such as deep squat-ting. 22,28-30 Several clues in the clinical history include sharp or deep intermittent hip pain. With potential osteo-chondral or labral injuries, patients may report catching, locking, or give-way (instability) sensations. 3,28 A clas- sic physical examination finding is a positive anterior impingement or FADIR test whereby the patients hip is passively flexed to 90\u00b0, followed by full adduction and internal rotation, with the presence of hip pain indicating a positive test. 3,17 In a study by Philippon et al.3, the anter - ior impingement test was positive in 99% of patients with radiographic confirmed FAI. Ganz et al. 28 also reported Chiropr Assoc 59(4) 405K MacIntyre, B Gomes, S MacKenzie, K D'Angelo that this test is almost exclusively positive in FAI-con- firmed patients. Another common finding in FAI patients is a positive FABER test with reduced range of motion on the affected side or a less commonly reported posi-tive posterior impingement test. 3,17 Common subjective measures used in FAI cases include the modified Harris hip score, the non-arthritic hip score, and the hip outcome score. 3 Although these clinical tests may allude to poten- tial hip pathology if positive, both FAI and intra-articular injuries are imaging-based diagnoses. 28-31 Conventionally , there are two imaging procedures used to diagnose and guide treatment in FAI cases; radiograph - ic examination and MRI, with MR arthrography remain - ing the gold standard to evaluate the labrum and articular cartilage. 8,31,32 Regarding radiographs, a supine AP pelvis and cross-table lateral are used with assessment of the lat-eral center edge angle (to assess pincer deformity) and the alpha angle, which is the most frequently cited par - ameter for the assessment of cam deformity. 8,31,32 The lat- eral center edge angle is formed by a vertical line and a line connecting the femoral head centre with the lateral edge of the acetabulum (Figure 1). 32 This measurement is used to assess lateral coverage of the acetabulum. The normal range is stated to be 25-39\u00b0, with angles greater than 39\u00b0 indicating over coverage. 31,32 On an axial view, the alpha angle is defined as the angle between a line from the center of the femoral neck to a line connecting the center of the femoral head to the point at which excess bone deviates the normal spherical shape of the femoral head (Figure 1). 7,8,32 An alpha angle greater than 50\u00b0 is present when defining a cam deformity.7 A previous nar - rative review has discussed these findings in detail for use in chiropractic practice. 8 Ross et al.13 set out to characterize radiographic de- formity between butterfly goaltenders and positional players with symptomatic FAI who were surgical candi - dates. They found that butterfly goaltenders had a higher prevalence of acetabular dysplasia and significantly great - er maximum alpha angles when compared to position-al players. They also demonstrated that there were sig-nificant differences in the location of the cam deformity among hockey positions, with a more lateral offset found in butterfly goaltenders. 13 Although firm clinical implica - tions cannot be drawn from this study, it does highlight potential adaptations that are unique to the positional de-mands of the ice hockey goaltender.PathomechanicsFAI is becoming a more predominant and detectable condition and is currently regarded as the most common cause of osteoarthritis in the non-dysplastic hip. 9,30,31 As previously discussed, FAI is a condition that has two dis-tinctive biomechanical categories: cam and pincer im-pingement. which impingement is occurring, the morphological changes and the subsequent inability to properly transmit forces efficiently will lead to future joint damage or insufficiency. 2,7,9 The cam impingement is an abnormality with regards to the proximal femoral structures presenting unusually large or misshapen (often aspherical). This abnormal structural formation causes an unusual articular interaction to occur in the hip, particularly in the anterosuperior portion of the acetabulum. 26,28 Abutment occurs between the abnormal proximal femur and acetabulum, inflicting most of their effect to the cartilaginous structures and rarely to the la-brum. 2,24,28 Alternatively, the pincer impingement is the result of an acetabulum abnormality where the proximal femur is partially, or fully engulfed by the bony protuber - ance of the acetabular rim. In cases of coxa profunda or protrusion, over coverage of the proximal femur leads to more insult on the labrum versus the cartilagenous por - tions of the joint. 2,26,28 With mixed impingement, both the articular cartilage and labrum are subject to injury.32-34 The muscles most commonly affected with symptomatic FAI are the adductor longus, proximal hamstrings, hip abduct-ors, and hip flexors (such as the iliopsoas). 33 As the body attempts to adapt to impingement, these muscles are often mechanically affected due to altered joint motion. 33,35 Athletes who partake in rigorous sporting movements are more likely to experience impingement, especially if internal rotation of the hip and axial loading are fre-quent. 2,9,36,37 Cam impingement is most symptomatic in sports requiring excessive hip flexion while the pincer impingement can limit athletes in multiple planes. 23,24,27 Ice hockey players have been reported to undergo more FAI-related corrective surgery than athletes from other sports. 37,38 When analyzing essential movements of the hockey stride, propulsion requires forceful extension, external rotation, and abduction of the hip (posterior im-pingement mechanism); while stride recovery requires the components of the anterior hip impingement mechan - ism: flexion, adduction, and al.10 confirmed these two at-risk skat-406 J Can Chiropr Assoc 2015; 59(4)Conservative management of F AI in a hockey goaltender: a case report ing stride in a population of youth hockey players with a mean age of 10.8 years. They noted that the push-off phase required an average of 11.5\u00b0 of external rotation with concurrent 13.2\u00b0 of abduction and 13.8\u00b0 of exten - sion. During the swing phase (or recovery period), a mean of 5.6\u00b0 of internal rotation was measured with 44.2\u00b0 of concurrent hip flexion. 9 Although the magnitude of these values are smaller then those measured during preopera-tive FAI resection, the repeated use of these hip positions throughout an ice-hockey players career may be a con-tributing mechanism in cases of acquired or congenital symptomatic hip impingement. 9 The demands of ice hockey goaltenders require unique movements when compared to positional hockey play-ers and other athletes. Some of these movements include dropping into and rising from the butterfly position, lat - eral push-offs, and sprawling movements. 9,13,14,39 It has been previously hypothesized that the butterfly movement performed by ice hockey goaltenders involves combined flexion, internal rotation, and axial load at the hip, leading to a higher risk of developing FAI. 13,14 Whiteside et al.9 set out to quantify hip mechanics during a \"long rebound sequence\" task, composed of three movements: skating and decelerating to a stop, dropping into a butterfly save, and pushing laterally from the butterfly position using the skate blade (recovery). Interestingly, none of the afore-mentioned movements involved concomitant hip flexion, adduction, and internal rotation in adequate ranges of motion that replicate those achieved in the FADIR test. 9 Internal rotation of the hip was found to be 21.2\u00b0 at max-imum and 11.5\u00b0 at peak axial loading (femoral shock) during the butterfly save, while the deceleration move-ment had internal rotation values of 32.6\u00b0 at maximum and 29.5\u00b0 at peak femoral shock. 9 As confirmed by Stull et al.,10 end-range hip internal rotation alone may be the pri- mary mechanism behind anterosuperior impingement in the hip. When comparing other sport-specific movements where cam-type FAI is prevalent, such as the side-splits in dance (38\u00b0), golf swing (35\u00b0), and taekwondo kick (31\u00b0), they experience similar internal ranges of motion as wit-nessed in on-ice deceleration movements. 9,40-42 Although the hip internal rotation experienced in the deceleration phases of the skating stride are not unique to goaltenders, future research may provide more clinical insight as to mechanisms resulting in more symptomatic FAI in this population. 9ManagementWhen considering the treatment options for patients diag-nosed with FAI and possible hip labrum complications, it is important to note the age, level of sport/activity, and physical findings. 37,43 Both conservative and surgical treatment aim to restore normal hip function, while de-creasing pain, and enabling the individual or athlete to return to their previous level of activity or sport. 2-4 A systematic review on FAI corrective surgery stated the main indications for surgery were an imaging-confirmed diagnosis of FAI accompanied by persistent pain and im-paired function that has not resolved from conservative management. 44 Indications for hip labrum reconstruction constitute young, active patients, without arthritis, along with findings of instability, pain, and hip dysfunction. 45 It is generally agreed that a trial of conservative care is initi - ated first in the absence of red flags or surgical indications mentioned previously, in an attempt to manage symptoms and improve function. 44-46 This was the scenario in the case presented as the patient was not a surgical candi-date despite having acetabular labral tears and associat-ed cam-type FAI. Previous literature detailing the role of chiropractic care for FAI is consistent with the approaches used in this case. 8,39 It is important to note that conserv- ative approaches can only address secondary functional neuromusculoskeletal issues attributing to pain and do not modify the osseous abnormality. 8 Currently , FAI surgery is generally based on an open or closed (arthroscopic) technique. The open technique allows for a fully exposed view of the femoral head and acetabulum, as the hip is openly dislocated. 2,17,44,47 For cam-type FAI, the aspherical head is corrected via re-section osteoplasty, while the acetabulum is trimmed or reoriented via periacetabular osteotomy. 2,47 However, the open technique comes with inherent risks and slower re-covery time when compared to the closed technique (arth-roscopy), which allows for a less invasive and reduced exposure during the surgery as well as a quicker recovery time. 2,44 The surgical intervention of choice for FAI with associated labrum pathology is labral debridement and re-pair. 45 Ayeni et al.45,46 revealed that labral repair resulted in superior outcomes when compared to labral debridement. When considering return to play for high-level athletes with FAI, it is important to note the success surgical inter - vention can have. Naal et al. 48 found that in professional athletes undergoing FAI surgery with hip dislocation (14 J Can Chiropr Assoc 2015; 59(4) 407K MacIntyre, B Gomes, S MacKenzie, K D'Angelo of which were ice hockey players), 21 of 22 patients were still competing professionally 12-79 months post-surgery, and showed favourable satisfaction with the hip surgery and their athletic ability. Another method using an iliotib - ial band autograft produced similar patient satisfaction and returning to a similar level of competition in elite ath-letes. 49 A recent systematic review showed that all studies with various surgical techniques all reported significant improvements in patient pain, function, and satisfaction rate, as well as improved range of motion and a high re-turn to sport rate of 98.2%. 44 Regardless if a patient or athlete with FAI is involved in a non-surgical or operative plan of management, re-habilitation is the cornerstone of treatment and must ad-dress any lumbopelvic and lower kinetic chain deficien - cies. 39,50 The rehabilitation process is similar after open or arthroscopic hip surgery and is broken down into four phases (Table 3). 39 The end goal of any rehabilitation pro- gram is to return the athlete to play at their previous level of competition. With respect to the hip, it is imperative to restore full range of motion (ROM), mobility, and build both endurance and strength. 39 When assessing the hip complex after corrective FAI surgery, the gluteal mus-cles, most notably gluteus medius, must be addressed as a priority since they are weakened and inactivated. 39,50 By restoring the strength, endurance, and dynamic control of the gluteal muscles through progressive exercises as demonstrated in the case (Table 2), patients can reinte - grate proper hip function and lower limb kinematics. 39 A well-designed post-operative rehabilitation program for the hip should limit excessive hip flexion, or over-acti - vation of the iliopsoas muscle short-term, which may cause irritation and prolong recovery. 39 Stationary hip abduction exercises are recommended for the activation of gluteus medius, while maintaining a relaxed iliopsoas. An over-aggressive exercise program should be avoided as it can lead to hip flexor irritation, muscle weakness, failure of a labral repair, and intra-articular adhesions. 39 When initiating sport-specific exercises for ice hockey goaltenders after post-arthroscopic hip surgery, progres-sion should begin with normalizing skating mechanics without equipment. Once skating mechanics are attained without pain or functional issues, adding equipment and moving to light goalie specific movements (post-to-post lateral glide) can begin. 39 Once these goals are achieved, adding speed, incorporating butterfly-specific positions, and utilizing explosive movements should be initiated. The final stage prior to returning a goaltender to play is to integrate all components in game-like situations with a conditioning component. 39 SummaryFAI has been observed to be more prevalent in athletic populations, and ice hockey goaltenders may be a specific at-risk athletic population. 9,13,14 Although the exact caus- es for this prevalence are unknown, recent literature has shown increasing evidence that acquired changes from sport demands over time may be a contributing factor. It is still important to consider the exposure of pre-existing congenital bone features and the potential of self-selec-tion to occur given this morphology for success in sport. As demonstrated by the case presentation, elite-level hockey goaltenders can present with morphological char - acteristics such as FAI or associated soft-tissue adapta - tions that may be further exposed or aggravated with their unique sport-specific demands. The butterfly technique was previously thought to be the main precipitating factor for FAI development in hockey goaltenders, but recent research suggests that skating mechanics, specifically de-Table 3.

Son stabilis\u00e9 Murdock Introduction The Salter-Harris (SH) classification system is used for fractures involving the growth plate (physis) in children. This system classifies fractures according to the pattern of involvement of the growth plate and surrounding bone as seen on radiographs (Figure 1). Type II fractures are identified by radiolucency in part of the growth plate ac-companied by radiolucency of a part of the metaphysis. Salter -Harris fractures of the toe and fractures in gener - al are not commonly seen or treated in chiropractic prac-tice. 1 However, toe fractures are one of the more common fractures diagnosed by primary care physicians, account - ing for 8-9% of fractures seen in primary care.2,3 Physeal fractures account for 15-30% of all childhood fractures.4,5 The incidence of such fractures has been reported at a rate of 14 cases per 10,000. 6 Boys are approximately twice5-7 as likely to have this type of fracture. For girls, these injuries usually occur between ages nine to twelve. 4,7 Brown8 indicated that 75% of all SH fractures were type II; therefore it is the most common physeal injury. Frac-tures of digits two through five are nearly four times more common than fractures of digit one. 2 For all age groups, phalangeal fractures are the most common fractures of the forefoot. 6 The symptoms of SH II (Salter-Harris type II) fracture can be explained using the mnemonic CC-OPQRSTA (see Table1). These symptoms warrant further physical examination including observation. The skin should be inspected for significant injuries such as \"open\" wounds that may lead to skin necrosis. 2 A fracture is considered \"open\" if there is a full thickness laceration around the fracture. 6 Toenails should be inspected for injuries such as subungual hematomas.2 Deformity of the digit should be noted2,6 as most displaced fractures and dislocations present with visible deformity2. Unfortunately, non-dis- placed fractures are not as apparent. Most patients with toe fractures have point tenderness over the fracture site 2, but contusions may also have point tenderness.examination findings despite histories suggesting seemingly innocuous mechanisms of injury. (JCCA. 2015;59(3):410-416) key words: Chiropr 59(4)Unexpected Salter-Harris type II fracture of the proximal phalanx of the second toe: a chiropractic perspective A thorough neurological and orthopedic evaluation that includes taking pulses and capillary refill, conducted. 6 Posterior tibial and dorsal pedis pulses should be evaluated with the understanding that 12% of healthy patients may not have a palpable dorsal pedis pulse. 6 Ca- pillary refill should be assessed while being cognizant that a delay in capillary refill may indicate circulatory compromise. 2 Holding the distal phalanx while applying a gentle, gradual, axial loading force is an important ortho-pedic maneuver that results in a sharp pain in the proximal phalanx if a fracture site is present, thus differentiating it from a contusion. 2 Uncommonly, tendon injuries may ac- company a toe fracture.2 Muscle injuries can be assessed by first having the patient initiate a very light contraction. Muscle testing may reveal heightened pain with gradual isotonic contraction in the presence of injury. Vibration with a 128 Hz tuning fork may cause heightened discom-fort. The presence of these subjective and objective findings would increase the suspicion of toe fracture. Chiroprac-tic guidelines to determine the necessity of radiography support their use with trauma and findings of injury in adults. 10 However, there is controversy regarding radi- ography of children as there is concern about unneces-sarily exposing children to ionizing radiation. Failure to diagnose a fracture could be harmful if the fractured fragments are not stabilized. This instability could lead to pain, weight-bearing dysfunction and/or displacement of bone fragments, which could in turn cause apparent or actual toe misalignment. Many cases of missed frac-ture exist in the literature. 11 With a history of trauma and significant examination findings, consideration of radiog-raphy before conservative treatment is important to avoid missing fractures. The objective of this paper is to present a case of a nine-year-old who was found to have a Salter Harris type II fracture. Case Presentation A nine-year-old child sought chiropractic care for second digit pain three days after she fell while playing bare-foot in the grass. She stated that she rolled her toes on the ground. She indicated moderate to severe pain when she walked or when digital pressure was applied to her toe. Using a splint and walking on the lateral edge of her foot decreased the pain, although there was still a con-stant ache. On examination there was mild swelling of the proximal aspect of the toe as well as antalgic gait. She was unable to walk without pain unless she favoured the lateral side of the affected foot. The alignment of the second digit was unaltered. The second digit was sensi-tive to applied pressure and slight motion. A tuning fork test mildly increased her pain when compared with no vi-Table 1. Typical symptom pattern for Salter-Harris type II fractures. CC - Chief complaint Pain at the fracture site and swelling2,6 O - Onset Bruising normally develops two to three hours after injury.6 Toe fractures are commonly a result of \"axial force (e.g., a stubbed toe)2 or a crushing injury (e.g., from a falling object)\".2,9 The most commonly associated activities include: assault, motor vehicle accidents, falls (recreation, sports) and striking objects.6 P - Palliative and Provocative factorsRelieving factors often include the use of splinting, rest, ice, compression and elevation.Aggravating factors often include movement of the joint, discomfort while wearing shoes, and difficulty walking. 6 Q - Quality and Quantity of painNormally a throbbing2 ache that becomes sharp with movement. Pain intensity varies from asymptomatic to severe. R - Radicular or Referred painTechnically does not apply to toe fractures. Pain distal or proximal to the fracture site can occur due to swelling or damage to adjacent nerves or blood vessels. S - Site If present, pain is at the site of injury.2 T - Timing Constant and increased with activity. A - Associated conditionsPossibly an isolated subungual hematoma.2 History of a significant mechanism of injury should prompt a lower back and findings coupled with parental preference led to x-rays being taken. A radiological series including dorsoplantar (DP), lat - eral and oblique views of the foot was obtained (Figure 2). A fracture extending from the medial cortex of the metaphysis at the base of the second proximal phalanx into the adjacent physis was noted. There was minimal displacement at the fracture site, although adjacent soft tissue swelling was observed. Bone mineralization was noted to be adequate. Based on these findings, a diagno-sis of a Salter-Harris type II fracture was made. The con-sulting radiologist suggested an orthopedic consultation. In the meantime, the patient's first and second toes were splinted together and she began using a set of crutches. The patient was evaluated by an orthopedist who rec- ommended taping digit two to digit three with a cotton swab between her toes and wearing a loosely fastened shoe as needed. The orthopedist recommended against the use of crutches. The patient noted that she was pain-free at a three-week follow-up appointment with the orthoped-ist. Follow-up radiographs demonstrated \"excellent cal - lus formation across the fracture. No new displacement is seen and early remodeling is present.\"DiscussionThis case involved a nine to twelve-year-old girl with a Salter-Harris type II fracture of the second digit. As such, it resembles the typical demographics for such injuries described in the literature. However, this case was unique due to the unusual mechanism of injury (rolling of her toes in grass), the relative rarity of evaluation of such injuries in chiropractic clinics, and the subtle nature of the complaint. Thus, several issues arise from this case. First, can seemingly minor, unusual events result in a Salter Harris type II fracture? Secondly, should trauma with modest clinical findings prompt the practitioner to use radiography? Finally, can uncomplicated Salter Har - ris type I and II fractures be managed by chiropractors? In this case, the mechanism of injury was considered unusual as it was not an obvious axial trauma2 nor a crushing injury.2,9 The chiropractor initially decided that the mechanism of injury and physical findings did not warrant radiography, but eventually referred the patient due to parental preference. With respect to the literature on the appropriateness of radiography for foot injuries, Bussieres et al 10 state that \"radiography of the foot for an adult is not required in the absence of metatarsal injury Figure 2. 2A - DP foot demonstrating fracture of 2nd digit to right foot.2B - Oblique view demonstrating the oblique fracture with minimal lateral displacement of the distal fragment.414 J Can Chiropr Assoc 2015; 59(4)Unexpected Salter-Harris type fracture of the proximal phalanx of the second toe: a chiropractic perspective and normal physical exam\". These authors do not indi- cate a threshold for \"abnormal physical exam findings.\" Axial trauma to the digits of the foot is common and gen-erally has minimal findings without resultant fracture. Therefore, \"abnormal physical exam findings\" should be clarified. In the present case, the child had minimal physical exam findings including slight ecchymosis, dif-ficulty ambulating, slight swelling, and a mildly positive tuning fork test. Parental preference coupled with those findings suggested a need for performing radiography. In the chiropractic setting, ruling out a fracture is pivot-al since a fracture is a contraindication to manual ther - apy including manipulation. 10,12 Radiographic studies of a suspected toe fracture should include dorsoplantar, lateral, and oblique views. 6 In addition, it is advisable to have multiple opinions on a radiograph for the purposes of risk management. 13 Historically, most SH I or II frac- tures have been viewed as innocuous injuries.14 George et al15 state that \"the alert emergency physician understands that for many urgent problems the adult and child may differ quite widely in pathophysiology. \" Chiropractors should be familiar with classification methods for physeal injuries . 4,15 The Salter-Harris classification is the most ac- cepted.4,6,16,17 The classification often provides evidence to determine the mechanism of injury. Mechanism of Injury The term mechanism of injury (MOI) can refer to the event or the details of the forces involved in the event. According to Armagan and Shereff 18, an abrupt abduc- tion force is the most common cause of fractures to the lesser toes. More specifically, Brown 8 remarked that SH I and II fractures result from \"shearing or avulsion forces that parallel the growth plate.\" The type of SH fracture is dependent upon mechanism of injury. 19 As per Devalen- tine16, SH fractures occur more often on the metaphyseal side of the growth plate. This helps explain why SH I and II do not normally affect growth. 4 Furthermore, avulsion of small fragments of bone from the phalanges can occur due to the insertion sites of the flexor and extensor ten-dons. Conversely, these tendons can be injured when a fracture is nearby. 2 Therefore the mechanisms of injury of SH fractures can include shear, crush, avulsion, abduction or axial load. In this case the fracture seems to have been caused by common abduction forces, however the event is unique as many children fall in the grass without result-ant fractures. As such these mechanisms of injury may result in emergent, complex presentations. Emergency Referral Emergency referral following foot trauma may be needed whether or not x-rays have been taken. In some circum - stances radiography may be postponed in the interest of a timely emergency referral. Referral to the emergency department without radiography should be performed for patients in significant distress, in shock, with vascular 2 or neurological compromise, obvious dislocation, open fractures or skin necrosis. The latter are at high risk for osteomyelitis. 2 Open fractures of the proximal phalanx are a surgical emergency and immediate orthopedic con-sultation is recommended to reduce complications, par - ticularly infection. 6 Referral to the emergency room after radiography is necessary for fractures with dislocation or intra-articular involvement (SHIII and IV). 20 Manage- ment of the following rare conditions would also require referral to an orthopedist: growth plate closure practitioners, referral is not recom - mended for children with uncomplicated (closed, non-dis-placed) SHI and II. 2 However, the chiropractor must be mindful of medicolegal issues such as the consequences of missed fractures 11,23 and their scope of practice with respect to fracture management24-26. Radiograph NecessityThe application of clinical practice guidelines can help clinicians determine the necessity of radiographic stud-ies. 10,27 Warning signs of severe injury can be summar - ized by the mnemonic PUMPS. Clinicians should assess for the following: history of a pop, snap or noises during injury, loss of usability, mode/mechanism of injury, pos- itional misalignment (may include swelling or bruising), sensation, motor, or vascular loss (pulse, warmth, color and capillary refill). As illustrated in the present case even subtle evidence of these signs could indicate the presence of a fracture. Importance of Foot Fractures for Chiropractors Findings related to fractures may be confused with evi-dence for joint misalignment. According to Burns 28, a mis- alignment of the MTP joint will present with loss of fluid motion, point tenderness and a soft tissue callus \"over tical application of this case study is for chiropractors to be aware that minor mechanisms of injury can sometimes cause significant injuries such as fractures. Radiograph-ic assessment should be considered to avoid mistaking a fractured toe for a joint misalignment and then manipu - lating that fractured toe. Such treatment could result in additional pain and displacement of the fragment. In this case, performing radiographic evaluation of the toe saved the patient from possible displacement of the fracture site and longer healing time if the joint was instead presumed to be misaligned in a chiropractic sense as described by Burns' criterion. 28 Management of Uncomplicated Salter-Harris Fractures by ChiropractorsAs chiropractors rarely manage fractures of this nature, additional training beyond traditional first aid training is likely warranted. This training would enhance pre-refer - ral management of SH fractures to orthopedists. Train-ing could include many of the details presented in this article: demographics, clinical presentation, examination, radiography and treatment. In this case, treatment in-cluded using cushioning (a cotton ball) between the toes before applying a splint. 18 This cushioning decreases the chance of pressure sores and helps maintain the normal alignment of the structure. Since the first digit carries a third of the body weight during stance phase, 18 taping digits two and three together is more appropriate than tap-ing digits one and two when digit two is fractured. The splint recommended for lesser digit fractures is a basket weave and buddy combination (Figure 3). 6,29 Prevention of uncomplicated lesser toe fracture includes encouraging the use of shoes during physical play. 9 When either of digits four or five are fractured, using a shoe with a rigid sole for support is recommended if well-tolerated. 18 The shoe can be loosened as needed. Crutches are often not recommended since weight-bearing aids in the healing of the fracture. Moreover, studies suggest that family phys-icians can manage most toe fractures with good results. 2,20 SH I and II have a low chance of resultant disability.18 If a review course would be adequate for family practitioners to manage fractures 3, then chiropractors could potential - ly learn to manage uncomplicated fractures as well, al-though it would have to fall within their scope of practice in their respective jurisdiction. This case study raises the question as to whether chiropractors need further educa-tion in the management of fractures prior to referral to an orthopedist. Summary This case illustrates two main points. Firstly, seeming-ly minor but unusual mechanisms of injury can result in SHII fractures. Secondly, chiropractors who evaluate pa-tients with toe pain secondary to trauma should consider radiography even with equivocal findings. References 1.

Findley Churchill, Livingstone, 2012, 475 pp., Paperback Price: CAN $86.24 ISBN: 978-0-7020-3425-1 As its title suggests, this textbook succeeds in establishing a valuable link between the growing bodies of scientific research on fascia and applying it practically. While fascial therapy and theory have been getting increased attention in recent years, there was still an apparent conceptual and practical disconnect in its understanding. Over 100 re-searchers and specialists on fascia from around the world contributed to the text, making its contents extremely well researched and diverse. This text is highly detailed and specific but progresses gradually, making it very readable. The book is divided into seven sections that are subcategorized into chapters and allow topics to build on one another. The numerous images, both photographs and drawings, greatly enrich learning and the concepts presented. In my opinion the thoroughness and comprehensive nature of the book make it essential for anyone working with fascia to own and read. In particular, section seven of the book gives an overview to many of the current fascial treatment systems and modalities in use today and their function and clinical significance. Without doubt, a sem-inal book in the field of fascial therapy, this text informs and guides everyone who comes in contact with fascia.

The text provides a com-prehensive yet practical overview in administering both general and specific aspects of sport exercise to patients or clients. Its pages cover current, pertinent information applicable to strength coaches, rehabilitation specialists and manual therapists for clinical or everyday use. 29 leading academics and experts in the field of sports per - formance training make contributions in this text, draw-ing from their skills and experiences working with pro-fessional teams and educational institutions from around the world. There is a very nice balance between current, high-level scientific research and practical, experiential insight. Among the numerous topics aptly covered in this text are many issues that are beneficial to any clinician work-ing with athletes. Topics like overtraining, injury preven-tion and rehabilitation, athletics in youth, motor control learning and periodization are such examples. The book includes many relevant photographs to reinforce concepts as well as abundant graphs, tables and case studies to aid understanding. Overall, High Performance Training for Sports pro- vides significant value for the price along with easy read-ing. While a background of knowledge in strength and condition is recommended for this book, I still recom - mend this text highly for those involved sports medicine and rehabilitation to enrich understanding of co-manag - ing athletes year round. Although some topics in this book are presented in incredible depth and detail, there is an abundance of general and easily applied information.
