An additional 7% volunteer that they don't know. Majorities across virtually every demographic and p artisan group view the vaccines as safe. However, there are some differences in attitudes, with less educated people and younger adults more likely to say they are not safe. The new national survey by the Pew Research Center, conducted Feb. 5 -8 among 1,00 3 adults, finds Republicans (89%) and Democrats (87%) generally agree that such vaccines are saf e for children who are healthy. Roughly nine -in-ten college graduates (92%) see vaccines for MMR as safe for health y children. This view is somewhat less widesp read among those with some college experience (85%) or a high school degree or less (77%) . Three -quarters or more in every age group say vaccines for MMR are safe. However, among adults 50 and older, 90% express this view, compared with 77% of adults 18 -29 and 81% of those 30 -49. A separ ate Pew Research Center survey of opinion among the public and scientists about science and society found widespread s upport for requiring childhood vaccinations: 68% of the public said children should be required to be vaccinated , while 30% in that survey said parents should be able to decide not to vaccinate their children. Young adults were more likely to say vaccinations should be a parental choice , while there was no significant difference in attitudes based on education. Large Majority Views Measles Vaccine as Safe Vaccines for diseases such as measles, mumps and rubella are ... for healthy children Survey conducted Feb. 5 -8, 2015. Figures may not add to 100% because of rounding. PEW RESEARCH CENTER 2 PEW RESEARCH CENTER www.pew research .org The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported 102 cases of measles in 14 states in the first 30 days of the new year, most of which were linked to an outbreak at Disneyland in California. Last year's 644 cases were the greatest number of cases since measles was eradicated from the U.S. in 2000, according to the CDC. Parents and non -parents have similar outlooks about the safety of childhood vaccines. Eight - in-ten adults (80%) who are a parent or guardian of a child under 18 say the vaccines are safe for health y children. Among those who are not parents of children und er 18, 85% say the vaccines are safe. A similar share of women (85%) and men (81%) say vaccines for MMR are safe for healthy children. Whites (87% safe vs. 6% unsafe) express a more positive view than non -whites (76% vs. 17%) about the safety of such vacci nes. Those who paid at least some attention to news about measles and vaccinations we re more likely to say vaccines for MMR are safe for healthy children. Among the 80% of the public who followed the story \"very, \" \"fairly, \" or \"not too closely, \" 87% say va ccines for MMR are safe for healthy children, 8% say they are unsafe and 5% don't know. People who followed the measles outbreak and vaccination debate \"not at all closely\" (19% of the public) are less likely to say the vaccines are safe. Among that group , just two -thirds (66%) say vaccines for MMR are safe for healthy children, while one -third say they are not safe (16%) or volunteer that they don't know (17%).

PEW RESEARCH CENTER 3 PEW RESEARCH CENTER www.pew research .org Those who say that vaccines for such diseases as measles, mumps and rubella are unsafe for healthy children (9% of the public) were asked why they feel this way. They cite a variety of concerns; no single factor predominates. Some are skeptical about the effectiveness of vaccines, while others question why healthy children should be given the vaccines. Still others say they distrust pharmace utical companies . Notably, very few respondents specifically raise concerns about vaccines causing autism or other disorders. Why Do You Think Vaccines Are Unsafe? For the Small Group of Skeptics, No Single Factor Stands Out Examples of Open -End Responses \"Because you are injecting a virus into a healthy kid, and I don't understand why\" -Woman, age 3 9 \"Because they're injecting you with a disease to prevent a disease\" -Woman, age 35 \"Honestly I don't trust pharmaceutical companies \" -Man, age 44 \"One of my children got a very high fever from the immunization\" -Woman, age 57 \"They make them sicker, it weakens the immune system, instead of allowing the body to use its own natural antibodies to fight it off \" -Woman, age 22 \"Some children cannot take the vaccines. They cause autism and other problems, muscular problems occasionally, but not very often\" -Man, age 66 Survey conducted Feb. 5 -8, 2015. Example of open -ended responses from those who say vaccines for diseases such as measles, mumps and rubella are u nsafe of all respondents; N=80 ). . PEW RESEARCH CENTER 4 PEW RESEARCH CENTER www.pew research .org Nearly three -in-ten Americans (29%) followed news about ISIS very closely. Comparable percentages say they very closely followed news about the recent measles outbreak and the debate over childhood vacc ines (25%) and U.S. economic news (24%). Just 12% paid very close attention to the situation involving Russia and Ukraine. Republicans are far more likely than Democrats or independents to say they followed news about ISIS very closely (44% vs. 25% and 27% , respectively). The partisan differences were much smaller in attentiveness to the week's other stories.

The survey was conducted by interviewers at Princeton Data Source under the direction of Princeton Survey Research Associates International. A combination of landline a nd cell phone random digit dial samples were used; both samples were provided by Survey Sampling International. Interviews were conducted in English and Spanish. Respondents in the landline sample were selected by randomly asking for the youngest adult mal e or female who is now at home. Interviews in the cell sample were conducted with the person who answered the phone, if that person was an adult 18 years of age or older. For detailed information about our survey methodology, see http://people -press.org/methodology/ The combined landline and cell phone sample are weighted using an iterative technique that matches gender, age, education, race, Hispanic origin and region to parameters from the 201 3 Census Bureau's American Community Survey and population density to parameters from the Decennial Census. The sample also is weighted to match current patterns of telephone status (landline only, cell phone only, or both landline and cell phone), based on extrapo lations from the 2014 National Health Interview Survey. The weighting procedure also accounts for the fact that respondents with both land line and cell phones have a greater probability of being included in the combined sample and adjusts for household siz e among respondents with a landline phone. The margins of error reported and statistical tests of significance are adjusted to account for the survey's design effect, a measure of how much efficiency is lost from the weighting procedures. 6 PEW RESEARCH CENTER www.pew research .org The following ta ble shows the unweighted sample sizes and the error attributable to sampling that would be expected at the 95% level of confidence for different groups in the survey: Sample sizes and sampling errors for other subgroups are available upon request. In addition to sampling error, one should bear in mind that question wording and practical difficulties in conducting surveys can introduce error or bias into the findings of opinion polls.
