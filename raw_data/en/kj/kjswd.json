Valmet's Half Year Financial Review, January -June 2020| 3 Guidance for 2020 Valmet announced on April 16, 2020 that the company withdraws its guidance for 2020 due to increased uncertainty related to the COVID -19 pandemic . Short -term market outlook Valmet reiterates the good short -term market outlook for pulp, and board and paper, the good/satisfactory short -term market outlook for automation, the satisfactory short -term market outlook for energy , and tissue , and the satisfactory/weak short -term market outlook for services . President and CEO Pasi Laine: Decent quarter despite the pandemic \"Valmet's orders received amounted to EUR 82 6 million in the second quarter of 2020. Orders received remained at the previous year's level in Pulp and Energy, and in Automation , decreased in Services and decreased from the previous year's high level in Paper. Our order backlog amounted to EUR 3,492 million. Valmet's net sales remained at the previous year's level , and the Comparable EBITA increased to EUR 76 million , corresponding to a margin of 8.3 percent . Our balance sheet was strong with a gearing of -23 percent . The COVID -19 pandemic impacted our operations in the second quarter. Many of our customers restricted access to their sites, which led to disturbances especially in Valmet's field services and mill improvement project s. The pandemic had a negative impact on Services' order inta ke and net sales. In the capital business, COVID -19 caused progress delays in projects and led to some delays in the supply chain network . On the other hand, the pandemic resulted in lower travel expenses. During the quarter we agreed to acquire 14.9 perce nt of Neles Corporation. Neles is a good quality global company with a large share of recurring business and a strong position in the pulp and paper industry. It has demonstrated good growth and has potential to grow further. Valmet's goal is to have an ac tive long - term role in the development of Neles. The strategic rationale of the share acquisition is further supported by the fact that Valmet and Neles have a common heritage, serve similar global industries and benefit from same global megatrends.\" Valmet's Half Year Financial Review, January -June 2020| 4 Key figures1 EUR million Q2/20 20 Q2/2019 1,587 10% Comparable earnings before interest, taxes and amortization (Comparable EBITA) 76 69 10% 128 117 10% % of net sales 8.3% 7.7% 7.4% 7.3% Earnings before interest, taxes and amortization (EBITA) 70 64 9% 121 113 6% % of net sales 7.6% 7.1% 6.9% 7.1% Operating profit (EBIT) 62 56 % of net sales 6.8% 6.2% 6.0% 6.2% Profit before taxes 60 52 15% 100 93 7% Profit for the period 44 39 15% 74 70 6% Earnings per share, EUR 0.29 0.26 15% 0.49 0.47 Cash flow provided by operating activities 151 -44 324 -14 Cash flow after investments 124 -217 280 -204 Return on equity (ROE) (annualized) 15% 15% Return on capital employed (ROCE) before taxes 38% Gearing2 -23% 17% 1 The calculation of key figures is presented on page 42. 2 At end of period.

On April 23, 2020, Valmet published a notice convening the Annual General Meeting, which took place on June 16, 2020. The resolutions of the meeting are presented above. Risks and business uncertainti es Valmet's operations are affected by various strategic, financial, operational and hazard risks. Valmet takes measures to exploit emerging opportunities and to limit the adverse effects of potential threats. The assessment of risks related to sustainable development holds an important role in risk management. If such threats materialized, they could have material adverse effects on Valmet's business, financial situation and operating result, or on the value of shares and other securities. The objective o f Valmet's risk management is to ensure the implementation of an effective and successful strategy for achieving both long - and short -term goals. The task of Valmet's management is to regulate risk appetite. In assessing risks, Valmet takes into considera tion the probability of the risks and their estimated impact on net sales and financial results. Valmet's management estimates that the Company's overall risk level is currently manageable in proportion to the scope of its operations and the practical meas ures available for managing these risks. Financial uncertainty in the global economy, coupled with fluctuations in exchange rates and tightening financial market regulations, may have an adverse effect on the availability of financing from banks and capit al markets and could reduce the investment appetite of Valmet's customers. Valmet estimates that the high proportion of business derived from stable business (Services and Automation) and the geographical diversification will reduce the possible negative e ffects that market uncertainties may have. If global economic growth weakens, it might have adverse effects on new projects under negotiation or on projects in the order backlog. Some projects may be postponed, suspended, or canceled. In the case of long -term delivery projects, initial customer advance payments are typically 10 -30 percent of the value of the project, and customers make progress payments as the project is implemented. This significantly decreases the risks and financing requirements related to Valmet's projects. Valmet continually assesses its customers' creditworthiness and their ability to meet their obligations. As a rule, Valmet does not finance Valmet's Half Year Financial Review, January -June 2020| 23 customer projects. If economic growth slows down significantly, the markets for Valmet's prod ucts may shrink, which may lead to, for example, tougher price competition. Changes and uncertainty in future regulation and legislation can also have critical effect s, especially on the energy business. Large fluctuations in energy prices can affect the global economy. These fluctuations can also affect Valmet and its customers, especially in the energy business. Changes in labor costs and the prices of raw materials and components can affect Valmet's profitability. Wage inflation is continuing , but Valmet's goal is to offset this at least partly through increased productivity and strict price discipline. It is possible, however, that tough competition in some product categories will make it difficult to pass on cost increases to product prices. On the other hand, some of Valmet's customers are raw material producers and their ability to operate and invest may be enhanced by strengthening commodity prices and hampered by declining commodity prices. To ensure a high level of quality in both produc tion and services, it is important to sustain a high level of competence and talent availability. This includes, for example, maintaining efficient recruitment programs, utilization of existing talent and sharing knowledge globally. Through acquisitions, V almet may become exposed to risks associated with new markets and business environments. The actual acquisition process also includes risks. Other risks associated with acquisitions include, but are not limited to, integration of the acquired business, inc reased financial risk exposure, retention of key personnel and achieving the targets set for the acquired business. Management of project business risks important An important part of Valmet's business consists of project business. Pulp business projects i n particular can be large, thus project -specific risk management is crucial. Key risks related to projects are project cost estimation, scheduling, project risk management, quality and performance risks, and materials management risks. Risk analysis shall, as a minimum, take place for all significant project quotations. The work concerning threat and opportunity assessment continues during the execution phase of the project. Risk management is based on careful planning and continuous, systematic monitoring and evaluation. Project risks are managed by improving and continuously developing project management processes and the related systems. There may be changes in the competitive situation of Valmet's individual businesses, such as the emergence of new, cos t-effective competition in the markets. Valmet can safeguard its market position by developing its products and services, and through good customer service and local presence. Availability of financing crucial Securing the continuity of Valmet's operation s requires sufficient available funding under all circumstances. Valmet estimates that its liquid cash assets and committed credit limits are sufficient to secure its immediate liquidity and to ensure the flexibility of financing. The average maturity of V almet's non -current debt, excluding lease liabilities, is 3.1 years. Loan facilities include customary covenants, and Valmet is in clear compliance with the covenants at the balance sheet date. Net working capital and capital expenditure levels have a key impact on the adequacy of Valmet's financing. Setting aside investments into the renewal of the ERP system, Valmet does not expect any Valmet's Half Year Financial Review, January -June 2020| 24 significant increase in annual capital expenditure and estimates that it is well -positioned to keep capital expenditure a t the level of total depreciation. Of the financial risks that affect Valmet's profit, currency exchange rate risks are among the most substantial. Exchange rate changes can affect Valmet's business, although the wide geographical scope of the Company's op erations reduces the impact of any individual currency. Economic insecurity typically increases exchange rate fluctuations. Valmet hedges its currency exposures linked to firm delivery and purchase agreements. Changes in legislation and the way authorities interpret regulation, for example regarding taxation, can also have an impact on Valmet's financials. As at June 30, 2020, Valmet had EUR 687 million (EUR 676 million) of goodwill on its statement of financial position. Valmet assesses the value of its goodwill for impairment annually, or more frequently if facts and circumstances indicate that a risk of impairment exists. Valmet has not identified any indicati ons of impairment during the reporting period. The principles used for impairment testing are presented in the Financial Statements. COVID -19 pandemic Depending on the success in suppressing the COVID -19 pandemic and in case the outbreak will be prolonged , there could be adverse impact on Valmet's operations, customer investment activity, project deliveries, supply chain and availability of financing f or both Valmet and its customers. Valmet currently has a large order backlog, strong balance sheet and liq uidity coupled with a flexible organization. This will aid Valmet in mitigat ing the global challenges caused by COVID -19. Events after the reporting period On June 17, 2020, Valmet announced that it has agreed to acquire 22,374,869 shares in the future Ne les Corporation from Solidium Oy, representing 14.88 percent of all Neles' shares and vot ing rights . The acquisition was completed on July 1, 2020. Valmet finance d the share acquisition with a new loan facility. Neles Corporation was created in the partial demerger of Metso, in which Metso's Flow Control business became the independent Neles Corporation list ed on Nasdaq Helsinki. There have been no other subsequent events after the review period that required recognition or disclosure. Guidance for 2020 Valmet announced on April 16, 2020 that the company withdraws its guidance for 2020 due to increased uncertainty related to the COVID -19 pandemic . Short -term outlo ok General economic outlook according to IMF The COVID -19 pandemic has had a more negative impact on activity in the first half of 2020 than anticipated in April , and the recovery is projected to be more gradual. Global growth is projected at -4.9 percent in 2020, 1.9 percentage points below the April forecast. In 2021 global growth is projected at 5.4 percent. IMF notes that there is a higher -than -usual degree of uncertainty around this forecast.

Basis of presentation These condensed consolidated interim financial statements for the six months ended June 30 , 2020 have been prepared in accordance with IAS 34 - Interim financial reporting and in conformity with IFRS as adopted by the European Union.

Key exchange rates Average rates Period -end rates Q1-Q2/2020 condensed consolidated interim financial statements Valmet's Half Year Financial Review, January -June 2020| 33 Reporting segment and geographic information The Group's Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM) is the President and CEO of Valmet. Valmet's four business lines are highly integrated through complementing product and service offerings and joint customer projects. Thus, the operations and profitability of Valmet is reported as a single reportable segment with the key operative decisions being made by the CODM at the Valmet Group level. One key indicator of performance reviewed is Earnings before interest, taxes and amortizati on (EBITA). Performance is also assessed through Comparable EBITA, i.e. with EBITA excluding certain items of income and expense that reduce the comparability of the Group's performance from one period to another. The alternative performance measures of E BITA and Comparable EBITA are published by Valmet as part of regulated financial information to enable users of the financial information to prepare more meaningful analysis on Valmet's performance. Items affecting comparability consist of income and expen ses arising from activities that amend the capacity of Valmet's operations, such as restructuring costs and gains or losses on sale of businesses or non -current assets , income and expenses incurred outside Valmet's normal course of business, such as impair ment charges and gains or losses recorded as a result of settlement payments to/from third parties (e.g. penalties incurred as a result of tax audits or settlements to close d law suits) as well as income and expenses arising from changes in legislation exp ected to affect Valmet temporarily only (e.g. customs or other tariffs imposed by authorities on Valmet's products).

Paper, and Pulp and Energy business lines' revenue is derived from large long -term capital projects , for which revenue is mostly recognized over time based on the cost -to-cost method. Se rvice business line's revenue arises from large volume of short -term contracts with relatively low individual value, for which revenue is mainly recognized at a point in time. Automation business line's revenue consists of long -term contracts and short -term service contracts. The nature of long -term contracts, and therefore also the revenue recognition method, is similar to capital projects although with average contract values being lower. Revenue for short -term service contracts is recognized at a point i n time. Nature of revenue in each area in any given reporting period is driven by volume and size of ongoing capital projects. Net sales by business lines: EUR million Q2/2020 Q2/2019 Q1-Q2/2020 Q1-Q2/2019 Services 322 361 617 637 Automation 77 82 146 145 Pulp and Energy 265 212 506 372 Paper 255 246 472 432 Total 919 901 1,740 1,587 Timing of revenue recognition: EUR million Q2/2020 Q2/2019 Q1-Q2/2020 Q1-Q2/2019 Performance obligations satisfied at a point in time 376 394 721 692 Performance obligations satisfied over time 543 507 1,019 895 Total 919 901 1,740 1,587 In order to mitigate credit risk and compensate for contract costs incurred upfront, Valmet regularly requires advance payments from its customers. During the reporting period Valmet had not entered into any material contracts where the period between when Valmet transfers a promised good or service to a customer and when the customer pays for that good or service will be one year or more. Neither were there any ongoing projects from previous reporting periods for which the former would apply. The creditworthiness of a customer is verified before entering into a contract. However, if a risk of non - payment arises after contract inception, the probability of collec tion of consideration is re -evaluated and if assessed improbable, recognition of revenue is discontinued. An allowance for non -collectability of open receivables and contract assets is established as concluded appropriate. Valmet receives payments from cus tomers based on invoicing schedules as set out in the customer contracts. Changes in contract assets and liabilities are due to Valmet's performance under the contracts. Amounts due from customers under revenue contracts primarily relate to Valmet's right to consideration for work completed but not yet invoiced at the reporting date. These assets are transferred to trade receivables when right to consideration becomes unconditional, which is typically at the time when Valmet has contractual right to issue a n invoice. Significant part of amounts due to customers relate to advance consideration received from customer in long -term capital contracts for which revenue is recognized over time. These amounts are recognized as revenue as (or when) Valmet performs un der the contracts.
