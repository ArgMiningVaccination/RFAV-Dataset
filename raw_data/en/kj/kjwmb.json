The aim of this study was to explore cancer survivors 'views on integrating T&CM services with conventional cancer care. Method: A mixed-method study design with an emphasis on qualitative methodology was used to conduct and analyse four focus group interviews and an on-line survey. Purposive sampling recruited 33 cancer survivors and caregivers from Arabic, Vietnamese, Chinese and Anglo-European Australian backgrounds who participated in one of four focus group interviews, and 121 cancer survivors who responded to an on-line survey. The inductive thematic analysis was augmented with a descriptive statistical analysis. Results: Most participants had used T&CM therapies or consulted T&CM practitioners as an adjuvant during and/or after their initial cancer treatment. Two themes emerged: 'positive perceptions and experiences 'and 'barriers and unmet needs '.P a r t i c i p a n t se m p h a s i s e dt h a tT & C Mw a sn o ta 'luxury item ', rather it was considered important for managing side effects and comorbidities, rehabilitation and quality of life. A wide range of complex, interrelated barriers and solutions to IO service provision and access were identified. Structural barriers included inadequate service provision, medical practitioner attitudes, logistical constraints and funding. Personal barriers were influenced by the severity of impairment and disability; attitudes, beliefs and knowledge about T&CM; and available resources (e.g. finances, time, transport). Unmet need and inequitable access was exacerbated by geographical location, ethnicity and ability to pay. There was a mismatch between where participants were accessing T&CM services and their preference for IO service delivery. Participants perceived hospital-based IO services availability to have several benefits, including the T&CM practitioners having more expert knowledge about cancer care, the convenience of co-locating oncology services, and potentially lower out-of-pocket costs. Conclusion: Patients 'use, preferences and needs for T&CM services in the oncology setting are important for informing service provision. Inequitable, unmet need reflected the increasing demand and expectation from patients for their oncology teams to be well informed about the benefits, risks and indications for T&CM use, and for the public and private health sectors to formally integrate and fund IO services.

BMC Complementary and Alternative Medicine (2018) 18:153 https://doi.org/10.1186/s12906-018-2209-6Background The significant use of traditional and complementary medicine (T&CM) by cancer survivors is well docu- mented [ 1-4]. Cancer survivors use T&CM for a variety of reasons that include managing treatment-related side effects and symptoms of cancers, enhancing the effect- iveness of cancer treatment, prolonging life, improving quality of life and affirming self-efficacy [ 5,6]. Among cancer survivors who do not use T&CM, barriers such as the cost and lack of time, fear and distrust, and lack of evidence are cited as reasons [ 7]. The term integrative oncology (IO) refers to the com- bining of T&CM interventions or services with conven- tional cancer care [ 8]. In this context, T&CM is mostly used as an adjuvant, rather than an alternative to stand- ard cancer treatment [ 9]. In response to the significant use and demand for T&CM by cancer survivors, IO aligns with the paradigm shift towards active participa- tion where patients are no longer encouraged to be pas- sive recipients of cancer care [ 10]. Cancer survivors have expressed a preference to involve their medical team in decisions about T&CM use with and for oncology ser- vices to provide T&CM services [ 11]. IO acknowledges the increasing role that cancer survivors have in man- aging their own care and the need to build therapeutic alliances that respect the preferences and values of can- cer survivors [ 9]. Similar to 'integrated care ', IO aims to reduce the fragmentation of oncology services [ 9,12]. Although interest in the implementation of IO services in Australia and abroad continues to grow, questions re- main about appropriate service development [ 13-18]. As for any quality improvement process, understanding patient needs and experiences are essential [ 19,20]. Research however has mostly focused on the prevalence of T&CM use, motivators and barriers for use, patient perceived outcomes, and challenges with patient-clinician communication. Less is known about cancer survivors 'ex- periences with IO services and their views on what the in- tegration of conventional cancer services with T&CM might look like, the types of services they need, and pref- erences for service delivery. If T&CM is to be successfully integrated with conventional cancer care services further research that includes the views of diverse cancer patient population groups is required. The estimated period prevalence of T&CM use by cancer survivors in Australia is 43% (95% CI: 19 -67%), and like other comparable countries in Europe and Northern America, these rates have dramatically in- creased over the past 40 years [ 3]. Despite the high rate of use and demand, IO service provision in Australia lags with less than a quarter of cancers services in the public and private health sectors providing any type of IO or supportive care [ 21,22]. Access to IO is further limited by affordability due to substantial out-of-pocketcosts for cancer care that is not provided by publicly funded hospitals [ 23]. Public health insurance rebates are only available for integrative medicine services and medical acupuncture provided by medical practitioners; and only some of the private health insurance schemes offer partial rebates for services provided by T&CM practitioners. It is important to provide a voice for the culturally and linguistically diverse (CALD) communities utilising can- cer services. Evidence suggests that survival rates for many CALD cancer survivors are lower than those of Anglo-Australian background [ 24]. English ability and knowledge of the health system are important contribu- tors, and have been found to be the strongest predictors of poor psychological and quality-of-life cancer outcomes [25]. After controlling for demographic and disease, CALD cancer survivors from any ethnic background have up to four times higher risks of depression and anxiety compared with their Australian-born Anglo counterparts [25]. They also experience higher unmet needs for infor- mation and help with physical problems that persist several years after initial cancer diagnosis [ 24]. There is evidence of unmet IO healthcare needs for cancer survivors from CALD backgrounds. In a series of focus group interviews with cancer survivors of Greek, Cantonese, or Mandarin speaking survivors who were living in Australia, although questions about T&CM were not asked by the researchers, participants still expressed unmet IO needs, such as difficulties with find- ing a traditional medicine doctor and accessing reliable expert information to help them manage their cancer and side effects [ 26]. Indeed, there is good evidence that a range of T&CM interventions can improve mental health and wellbeing [ 27], suggesting a potentially im- portant role for IO in providing both culturally appro- priate and clinically effective services. In light of the growing use and demand for IO services in Australia, this study aimed to explore cancer survi- vors 'views and experiences with IO, service needs, pref- erences, enablers and barriers; and to ensure the views of some of the culturally and linguistically diverse (CALD) population groups that are underrepresented in Australian cancer research were included. Methods Design A mixed-method study design with an emphasis on qualitative methodology was used to conduct and analyse four focus group interviews and an on-line survey. Sample and recruitment Purposive sampling was used to recruit cancer survivors from Anglo-European, Arabic, Chinese and Vietnamese Australian backgrounds living in Sydney for four focusHunter et al. BMC Complementary and Alternative Medicine (2018) 18:153 Page 2 of 14group interviews and an on-line survey. The rational for selecting the three CALD groups reflected the prevalence of these communities in South West Sydney region where the research was located. Although Australian and Torres Strait Islander peoples are also common in this region, these communities were not included due to the logistical constraints of the project. Focus group participants were recruited through the distribution of information sheets in English, Arabic, Chinese, and Vietnamese by collaborating hospital clinics, culturally specific cancer support services and a hospital-based cancer wellness centre. Interviewees were offered AUD25 gift card as a reimbursement for expenses. Survey participants were recruited through Facebook net- works such as the National Breast Cancer Foundation, Oncology Massage Ltd., and natural therapies organisa- tions. Recruitment strategies for the survey anticipated mostly sampling cancer survivors from Anglo-European Australian backgrounds and T&CM users. Procedure and instruments The focus groups were designed to facilitate the in- depth examination of subjective experiences, meaning, and perceived consequences of T&CM use and its inte- gration in the context of cancer services. Additional file 1 outlines the interview schedule. Basic demographics were collected via a simple paper questionnaire that was written in English. The interviewers and translators assisted participants when language was a barrier. Two experienced interviewers (author CP and a graduate as- sistant AH, see acknowledgements) used an \"extended conversation \"technique ([ 28], p. 96), in which the word- ing and formatting of questions was flexible to suit the particular context and experience of the participants. There were no prior relationships established between researchers and participants prior to study commence- ment. The interviews were conducted in hospital and community locations. Interpreters were used for the three CALD groups. The interpreter for the Chinese group was accredited in Mandarin and Cantonese. Interpreters were asked to translate the actual wording of each participant 's talk ra- ther than summarising responses to capture the detail of participant accounts. A questionnaire was used to collect anonymous information about the demographic and cancer history of participants. The interviews ran for ap- proximately 60 min and were audio-recorded and tran- scribed verbatim, with the resulting transcripts then read in conjunction with the audio recording to verify any er- rors in transcription. The online survey was administered through Survey- Monkey [ 29]. It was anonymous and consisted of 26 closed and open-ended questions examining partici- pants 'views on T&CM in the context of cancer(Additional file 2). This included demographic and can- cer history questions, whether participants had used T&CM services and therapies, the context of their use, where they would like to have received T&CM, and en- ablers and barriers using T&CM as part of their cancer care. Open-ended questions were used to collect the demographic information; eleven of the close-ended questions were followed by an open-ended question ask- ing for an explanation to the response; seven multiple choice questions included an open-ended option \"Other (please specify) \";a n dt h es u r v e ye n d e dw i t has e c t i o n for further comments. The questionnaire was de- signed to collect data compatible with the topics dis- cussed in the interviews. Although prayer and spiritual practices are one of the most commonly used non-biologically based CM therap- ies both in Australia and abroad [ 3,30,31], questions about prayer were excluded. The focus of the research was IO services and in Australia, pastoral care services are not classified as an IO service [ 3,30,31]. The re- searchers recognise that the boundaries can be blurred, as T&CM wellbeing services such as meditation and mindfulness may draw on religious philosophies and traditions, and spirituality (rather than religiousness) is considered to be a domain of 'holistic health '[32,33]. Nevertheless, the decision was made that prayer and pas- toral care were outside the scope of this research project. Analysis Thematic analysis of the of the interview transcripts and open-ended survey responses was conducted [ 34]. The style of analysis adopted was inductive with the develop- ment of themes being data driven. A subset of the inter- views was independently read by two of the authors to identify first order codes, such as benefits, negative experi- ences, practitioner attitudes and awareness. The entire data set (interview transcripts and survey answers) was then coded using NVivo Version 11 [ 35]. The coded data was independently reviewed by two of the authors. Codes were then grouped into higher order themes. A careful and recursive decision-making process which involved checking for emerging patterns, for variability and consistency, and making judgements about which codes were similar and dissimilar was used to develop a thematic map of the data outlining core themes and subthemes. Quantitative data from the survey was analysed using de- scriptive statistics in IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, V e r s i o n2 4 . 0[ 36]. Some of the open-ended responses to survey questions were also rec oded into categorical groups. Recruitment for the survey was designed to augment the qualitative results from the interviews rather than create a representative, generalisable sample. When calculating the percentage of responses to a question, missing data was therefore excluded from the denominators.Hunter et al. BMC Complementary and Alternative Medicine (2018) 18:153 Page 3 of 14To minimise bias regarding the coding and interpret- ation of the qualitative data, the research team undertak- ing the analysis was comprised of members with and without a background in IO or T&CM. Five of the re- searchers were female and three were male. Results Sample and response rates Purposive sampling recruited 33 cancer survivors and caregivers from Arabic ( n= 11), Vietnamese ( n= Anglo-European Australian ( n=6 ) backgrounds for the focus group interviews (Table 1). Four of the Arabic focus group participants were care- givers. Although their recruitment was unintended, the participants 'caregivers were nevertheless invited to par- ticipate in the focus group discussion. For the online survey, 121 cancer survivors responded (Table 2). Most of the survey questions were not com- pulsory; as such, response rates to questions ranged from 100% ( n= 121) down to 67% ( n= 84). Mostly, this was due to skipped questions throughout the survey with only 14 (12%) not completing the survey. Participant characteristics The average age of participants was 64 and 60 years for the focus group and survey respondents respectively; and the median years since cancer diagnosis was 6 years (range: 0.3 -30 years) and 3.6 years (range: 0.3 -36. 5 years). The majority of focus group participants were female (Table 1). The survey accidentally omitted a question on gender. Cancer diagnosis, however, demon- strates that at least 82 (68%) respondents were female (Table 2). Focus group participants were not asked about their cancer diagnosis. The survey sample of 121 respondents was biased to- wards English speaking Anglo-European Australians who were females, with a diagnosis of breast cancer, and oncology massage users. Just under half (46%) of the re- spondents were currently engaged in either active treat- ment (e.g. surgery, chemotherapy or radiotherapy) or long-term treatment (e.g. hormone suppression medica- tion, other medication, or rehabilitation), and 59% had received some form of treatment for their cancer in the previous 12 months. All participants in the Arabic focus group categorically denied having any experience with any type of T&CM as part of their cancer care. Participants in the other three focus groups had used T&CM during or after their ini- tial cancer treatment. Most of the survey respondents (92.2%, n= 107/119) had used a range of T&CMTable 1 Characteristics of focus group participants Participants n=3 3 % Cancer survivors 29 88 Caregivers (Arabic) 4 12 Average age (years) n=3 1 S D Cancer survivors & caregiversa64.0 9 Gender n=3 3 % Female 23 70 Male 10 30 Ethnicity n=3 3 % Arabic 11 33 Vietnamese 9 27 Chinese 7 21 Anglo-European 6 18 Median years since diagnosis n= 29 range Cancer survivors 6 0.3 -30 adata missing for 2 caregiversTable 2 Characteristics of survey respondents Average age (years) n= 121 SD 59.6 11.1 Country of Birth n= 121 % Australia (2 ATSIa) 92 76.0 New Zealand (2 Maori, 2 Samoan) 6 5.0 Europe / United Kingdom 17 14.0 Africa 3 2.5 Asia 3 2.5 Languages spoken at home n= 120 % English 116 96.7 English and another language 4 3.3 Median years since diagnosis n= 121 range 3.6 0.3 -36.5 Diagnosis n= 121 % Breast or gynaecological cancer 82 67.8 Haematological, bowel, skin or lung cancer 25 20.7 Prostate cancer 4 3.3 Other (includes multiple primary cancers) 10 8.3 Current treatment n= 121 % No treatment 65 53.7 Long-term treatment / rehabilitation 46 38.0 Active treatment 10 8.3 Treatment in last 12 monthsbn= 120 % None 50 41.6 Surgery 38 31.6 Radiotherapy 31 25.8 Chemotherapy 26 21.6 Other cancer medication 25 20.8 aATSI - identified as Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander bmore than one response permittedHunter et al.

No-one had used T&CM instead of, nor as an alternate, to their standard cancer treatment. Thematic results In the final stage of mixed method analysis, two overarch- ing themes emerged. The first theme, \"positive percep- tions and experiences \", predominantly drew on the data from the focus group interviews. Seven subthemes were identified: 1) perceived positive impact on cancer survival, 2) perceived positive impact on side-effects and recovery, 3) perceived positive impact on co-morbidities, 4) per- ceived positive impact on wellbeing, 5) downplaying nega- tive outcomes, 6) positive experiences with T&CM practitioners, and 7) positive experiences with IO services. The second theme, \"barriers and unmet needs \", drew on data from both the survey and the focus group interviews. Five subthemes were identified: 1) lack of availability of IO services, 2) difficulties with referral pathways and information, 3) absence of medical practi- tioner support, 4) difficulties with access, and 5) cost of care. Two other interacting subthemes were identified a) structural barriers and b) personal barriers that applied to the five other sub-themes. For example, difficulties with accessing IO services reflected both structuralbarriers, such as only hospital-based services were of- fered, and personal barriers, such as being too unwell to travel to the hospital to access the service. In the presentation of the results below, the survey data reports the frequency of responses as they relate to the core themes and subthemes that emerged from the quali- tative analysis. The meaning and consequences of these themes draws on the qualitative analysis of the interviews and the open-ended survey items. Details of the data source -focus group (FG) or survey -are only provided for longer quotes that are presented in Tables 4and5. THEME 1: Positive perceptions & experiences Throughout the focus group interviews, participants re- ported a range of positive experiences and perceived benefits of using T&CM throughout their cancer journey (Table 4). One was of the belief that it could have a posi- tive impact on cancer survival. Many discussed the posi- tive impact of T&CM on side effects and recovery. T&CM was used more broadly for comorbidities other than just cancer care. Participants reported positive ex- periences with T&CM practitioners, emphasised their appreciation of professional T&CM care and identified benefits of an IO approach to service provision. Although the survey did not specifically ask about per- ceived benefits from T&CM use, the majority of survey respondents (95%, n= 92/97) stated that they 92% ( n= 98/107) would consider using T&CM again. Perceived positive impact on cancer survival One of the perceived benefits of T&CM that was identi- fied during the focus group discussions was a positive impact on cancer survival, \"so the tumour -it remains the same. It didn 't develop more ...Over time, I see my health start to get better \". Another participant provided an account of the benefits of eating \"normal food, balanced food, good exercise \"combined with Chinese medicine for \"fighting \"cancer (Table 4). Perceived positive impact on side-effects and recovery Participants gave accounts of using T&CM to \"enhance treatment and protect [the] body against side effects of treatment \"or\"to improve my general health \"after treat- ment (Table 4). This included the benefits of massage \"to improve my overall general health and to assist with managing lymphoedema \"and \"to assist my rehabilita- tion \";vitamins \"to assist with side effects of chemotherapy induced menopause \"; meditation to \"reduce the pain- killers \";acupuncture to deal with \"pain on my legs \"; and tai chi and yoga \"to make you feel a little bit more important and a little bit more active \".Table 3 Survey participants 'use of traditional and complementary medicine T&CM use since cancer diagnosis n= 116 % Both T&CM modalities & products 74 63.8 Only T&CM modalities 28 24.1 Only T&CM products 5 4.3 Any T&CM use 107 92.2 No T&CM use 9 7.8 T&CM modalities commonly used since cancer diagnosisan= 116 % Massage or touch therapy 93 76.9 Mental wellbeing (e.g. meditation, art/music therapy) 61 50.4 Movement modalities (e.g. yoga, tai chi, massage) 41 33.9 Naturopathy or nutritional medicine 38 31.4 Acupuncture or Chinese medicine 17 14.0 Body Alignment (e.g. chiropractic, osteopathy, cranio-sacral)15 12.4 Indigenous Australian healing practices 1 0.8 Other 2 1.7 Timing of T&CM usean=9 6 % Before commencing cancer treatment 14 14.6 During cancer treatment 44 45.8 Following cancer treatment 75 78.1 amore than one response permittedHunter et al. BMC Complementary and Alternative Medicine (2018) 18:153 Page 5 of 14Perceived positive impact on co-morbidities T&CM was also used to deal with concurrent health problems that exist alongside cancer-related symptom- atology (Table 4). In supporting general health and co- morbidities, the use of T&CM was seen as an important adjuvant to conventional cancer care by helping to im- prove tolerability and cancer outcomes. Perceived positive impact on wellbeing Participants emphasised the important \"remedial \"and \"therapeutic \"role T&CM played in as an uplifting, heal- ing experience that supports wellbeing amidst the stressors of cancer treatment (Table 4). The holistic ap- proach of T&CM therapists and their ability to help with physical and emotional symptoms was also identified. Downplaying negative outcomes Not all outcomes from T&CM use were positive, how- ever, and another participant described a perception of a social bias regarding T&CM outcomes within his com- munity (Table 4). Successes of T&CM were acclaimed, and failures suppressed. For others, despite uncertainty about any benefits, they continued to use T&CM. Positive experiences with T&CM practitioners Participants reported positive experiences with T&CM practitioners and emphasised that practitioners with ap- propriate training helped ensure quality care (Table 4). Naturopaths were identified as having the necessary ex- pertise for an in-depth discussion about supplement use. Acupuncture practitioners were described as \"so calm \" and as having \"that specific training with oncology \",Table 4 THEME 1 - Positive perceptions & experiences Perceived positive impact on cancer survival \u0081Interpreter: \"The cancer in my lungs had developed and went up to the brain.

I know I have the cancer, but they are minor. So, then I think about other complementary therapy like a supplement, like what [another participant] told and I did went to see a traditional herbal Chinese doctor ...after recovery from the surgery, I 'm back to normal. \" (Chinese FG) \u0081Interpreter: \"Since I started meditation, I 've reduced on the painkillers. \" (Vietnamese FG) Perceived positive impact on co-morbidities \u0081\"...But I found with the acupuncture and the massage in particular, apart from the side effects that you get from the traditional treatments -your chemotherapy, your radiation .... if you had any other ailments prior to cancer, they continue to exist throughout the whole cancer ... journey. And those supplementary therapies help with that as well as the other, because when you have got cancer, those other things suddenly seemed magnified. \"(Anglo-European FG) \u0081\"The massage is great for me because I have all the underlying [health problems] are also a part of me ...The doctor said, \"We can 't give you chemo that these guys have had, \"...he said to me, \"If we give you normal chemo, your lungs will pack in before you do. \"Now, he said to me[there was a change in the treatment plan] and I said, \"Why? \"He said, \"because you 're not as sick as you should be \"and I said, \"Well, is that a positive? \"...and I just feel the complementary things that they do give us, the massage, to me, is a Godsend. \"(Anglo-European FG) Perceived positive impact on wellbeing \u0081\"I haven 't tried anything else but the massage. I found it really relaxing especially the last time I went. That 's about a couple of weeks ago. I have a problem. I was tired. I wasn 't having any energy. I was really depressed and when she took me in for about 45 min, when I come out and I felt like, \"God bless you. You 're here to help people. \"It was so beautiful, and so relaxing, so good. So you come out and you think, 'God, please help those ladies and help us to help others. '\"(Anglo- European FG) \u0081\"Yeah, so I 've-started the supplement. I find I 'm full of energy. I feel well again. I feel great. So therefore, I continued taking the supplement so hopefully that it will bring a good immune system to me that I can continue to work and do my normal stuff. \"(Chinese FG) \u0081\"There 's the physical symptoms and so on that you get, and then there 's the emotional.

Because a lot of people -in my opinion and just my opinion, have no training whatsoever, but a lot of people will take vitamin supplements and so on. If you 're taking vitamin D, and you don 't need it, it 's wasted. \"(Anglo-European FG) Positive experiences with IO services \u0081\"I think to have it close by to where the other treatments are taking place helps, because I was able to go from radiation and then after I finished my treatment, then come up to the wellness centre and continue with whatever it was that I needed. \"(Anglo-European FG)Hunter et al.

This is one of the barriers. \"(Chinese FG) \u0081\"All of us, we are a pensioner... a y [for T&CM] \". (Arabic FG) \u0081\"They are very expensive as an ongoing treatment given all the out of pocket expenses associated with cancer surgery. \"(Survey) \u0081\"Complementary therapies are seen as a luxury and often expensive especially when income capacity is reduced due to illness. \"(Survey) \u0081Interpreter: \"Yeah.

It 's not. And the same with the acupuncture, it 's not just feel-good stuff and I can 't emphasise that enough. It 's much, much more. \"(Anglo-English FG) \u0081\"I myself struggle to pay for them ...and they aren 't a luxury item they are a necessity to minimize damage and should be part of the Medicare rebate. \"(Survey)Hunter et al. BMC Complementary and Alternative Medicine (2018) 18:153 Page 7 of 14which meant that \"they have training and awareness of the whole thing \"resulting in reports of \"confidence \"in the outcomes of T&CM. Others noted a difference in quality between massage provided by the trained oncol- ogy massage therapists available at the hospital and gen- eral massage services provided in the community \"the massages outside aren 't any good \". Positive experiences with IO services Participants perceived hospital-based T&CM services to have several benefits, including the provision of a \"com- pletely holistic sort of treatment plan \",practitioners hav- ing expert knowledge about cancer care, the benefits of locating services close to the site of other cancer treat- ment, and lower out of pocket costs (Table 4). IO services were also provided through the participants primary care services, such as a General Practitioner (GP) who was also provided acupuncture services. THEME 2: Barriers and unmet needs A lack of availability of IO services, difficulties with re- ferral pathways and information, the absence of medical practitioner support, difficulties with access, and the cost of IO care were identified as the key barriers and unmet needs for IO services (Table 5). Only 15% (16/107) of the survey respondents reported that there were no bar- riers preventing them from using T&CM, or using more T&CM. Barriers could be further understood by consid- ering the interrelationship between structural barriers and personal barriers. Examples of structural barriers in- cluded inadequate service provision, service location, medical practitioner attitudes, unclear referral pathways, lack of information, and lack of funding. Personal bar- riers for the individual and their caregivers were influ- enced by the severity of impairment and disability; attitudes, beliefs and knowledge about T&CM; and avail- able personal resources (e.g. finance, time or transport). Lack of availability of IO services Participants reported there were T&CM services that they would like to have used but could not. One of the reasons for this was inadequate service provision, includ- ing a lack of culturally appropriate T&CM services, and services in regional/remote areas (Table 5). Of the sur- vey respondents, 36% ( n= 39/107) reported that lack of availability of services either stopped them from using T&CM or from using more T&CM. Both interviewees and survey respondents reported the absence of specific T&CM services or difficulties with finding T&CM practitioners knowledgeable in can- cer care: \"I couldn 't find a decent massage therapist ... who understood cancer, scars, and lack of skin sensation \"; \"reflexology wasn 't offered \";\"it's hard to find suitably trained providers \". If T&CM services were availablethrough the hospital, they were described as \"often very booked \", with \"demand far, far greater than the service that 's available \"(Table 5). The time available for T&CM therapy sessions, when they were available, duration of treatment, and limits being placed on the total num- ber of sessions, were also a focus of criticism. Several participants in the focus group discussions also re- ported a limited mindset and expertise on the part of hospitals in the provision of culturally appropriate T&CM services (Table 5). Difficulties with referral pathways and information Even when hospitals were providing T&CM services, structural barriers, such as obtaining referrals and infor- mation about available T&CM services, remained an obstacle; however, \"once you come through that front door,you get that information. But it 's getting through that front door, somebody telling you that it exists \". Inadequate information was given as the primary reason why no-one in the Arabic focus group had used T&CM nor IO services (Table 5). Focus group participants reported frustration with their healthcare professionals not discussing T&CM op- tions, being slow to refer, or receiving conflicting infor- mation about safety and indications, noting that the onus was on patients to question their healthcare profes- sionals about T&CM options (Table 5). Often, it was up to the participant to seek out information or find a pos- ter or leaflet in the oncology department advertising the IO, to which one participant remarked \"I didn 't see it \". Other participants talked about being referred straight to conventional treatment, with a lack of consideration for T&CM adjuvant therapies (Table 5). A disparity was found in the survey results between how participants wanted to receive referrals to T&CM and obtain information about T&CM and what they had received. When the survey participants were asked: \"How would you like to be referred to a T&CM service \", 63% ( n= 69/110) of respondents indicated they would prefer a referral via an oncologist or GP, with 22% ( n= 25/110) indicating self-referral as the method of choice. Yet of the 94 survey respondents who reported they had accessed T&CM services, only 47% of respondents re- ported that a medical doctor (either a specialist or GP) had made the referral or recommendation and 46% had self-referred. While T&CM users were finding ways to access T&CM in the community without a GP or oncologist, there was a clear preference for referrals to come from this quarter as medical practitioners were held in a pos- ition of expertise: \"I also take the doctors opinion 'cause they have better knowledge \". Other participants com- mented that GPs were better placed than specialists to distribute information and monitor T&CM use becauseHunter et al. BMC Complementary and Alternative Medicine (2018) 18:153 Page 8 of 14they \"work with you like a family \"and patients had more frequent contact with GPs than their specialist medical practitioners (Table 5). The need for trusted, reliable information from a var- iety of sources was emphasised throughout (Table 5). Participants gave accounts of wanting more information about T&CM from their GP -\"even a little that 's got one or two pages \",\"there 's a lack of information \"-and for the provision of information and referrals by GPs be supported by other channels as well. Others preferred information sources and referrals were via social workers, pharmacists or community or religious leaders; books, magazines with diagrams, or succinct information presented in a pamphlet written by T&CM therapists; or \"through word of mouth from somebody who has been through the same or similar experience \"or\"friends \". Although some focus group participants reported the use of websites, information from the internet was gen- erally viewed as unreliable or difficult to access because \"nobody know how to use the internet \". Absence of medical practitioner support Participants identified ambivalent or negative attitudes from their healthcare professionals (particularly GPs and oncology specialists); difficulties with doctor-patient communication, including disclosure of use and building a therapeutic alliance; conflicting advice or a lack of knowledge about T&CM options; the necessity for scien- tific evidence; and professional and cultural divides (Table 5). In the survey, 13% ( n= 11/84) of respondents selected \"unsupportive healthcare practitioner / doctor \" as a reason for not using T&CM or more T&CM. Although many participants talked about their wish to freely discuss their T&CM use with their doctors, nega- tive and ambivalent attitudes from the medical profes- sion were reported to have an impact on patient disclosure of T&CM treatments (Table 5). These nega- tive attitudes were at odds with the survey findings whereby virtually all respondents (98%, n= 109/111) opted for wanting their oncology team to know that they were using T&CM therapies and 63% ( n= 69/110) pre- ferred a referral from either their GP or oncologist. Open discussion about T&CM use with doctors was seen as a way to improve \"coordinated care! \".The \"on- cology team and therapy teams should work together \" and \"be fully informed to reach the best outcome. \"Safety, interactions, contraindications and \"potential risks \"that T&CM may \"interfere with treatment \". Disclosure of T&CM use to the oncology team was also described as a way to \"educate them about the benefits of using those therapies \"and prompt clinical inquiry, as the doctor \"can then ask how is it helping / why etc. \"This in turn may increase the likelihood of others benefiting from IO. For other participants, discussion about T&CM was seenas a way of reminding their oncology team about the im- portance of self-care and holistic healthcare (Table 5). Not all participants however, wanted to disclose their T&CM use or thought it was appropriate. When one participant from the Vietnamese focus group was asked if they had talked to their doctors, or wanted to talk, about the Chinese herbal medicines they were taking, on both occasions the answer was \"no\",as they perceived the role of their GP was only to provide \"prescription of the painkillers. \" In other instances, despite disclosure by the patient, some medical practitioners remained ambivalent to T&CM use and were reluctant to enter a discussion or provide definitive advice (Table 5). Participants accounted for their negative experiences with discussing T&CM by suggesting the medical profession was limited by the lack of scientific evidence available for a T&CM (Table 5). In addition to insufficient evidence, participants also spoke about their frustrations with perceived professional and cultural divides between T&CM and mainstream medi- cine (Table 5). Throughout, participants called for a patient-centred approach that is respectful of the patient 's views and preferences that considers them a valid member of the decision-making team (Table 5). Difficulties with access The location of available IO services, preferences for ser- vice location, and the logistics of accessing them were identified by both interviewees and survey respondents as important barriers (Table 5). Logistics (e.g. no trans- port) and personal factors (e.g. too unwell or not enough time) accounted for 11% ( n= 11/84) and 6% ( n= 9/84) respectively the reasons for not using any or more T&CM therapies. Two-thirds of the survey respondents (65%, n= 70/ 107) wanted to access T&CM services across a range of service settings, with 22 (21%) wanting to access IO in- patient and outpatient services; 23 (21%) following in- patient care, either as an outpatient or through their primary care clinic; and 25 (23%) across the continuum of primary and secondary care services including non- medical community settings. Some participants however, preferred to access T&CM in non-medical settings. Of the 43 (40%) survey respondents who selected a 'com- munity health centre 'as a preferred site, 11 (10%) only wanted to access these services in non-medical environ- ments as \"Hospitals make you feel 'you are sick ',\"whereas a community centre \"can mean it 's just 'your time \". Results from the survey however, identified an appar- ent mismatch between where participants were accessing T&CM services and their preferences. Around two- thirds (69%, n= 74/107) of the survey respondents re- ported that they wanted to access T&CM services at home or close to home, yet only 23% ( n= 22/95) hadHunter et al. BMC Complementary Medicine (2018) 18:153 Page 9 of 14accessed T&CM services at home. The desire to access T&CM through the hospital (either as inpatient and/or outpatient) was reported by 64% ( n= 69/107) ( n= 16/95) had accessed T&CM in a hospital setting. Access via a med- ical practitioner in the community was also low with 14% ( n= 13/95) accessing 26% ( n= 27/107) selecting this location. A better match was observed between respondents who wanted to access T&CM through a community health centre or private T&CM provider (45%; n= 43/95) and those who did (42%; n= 45/107). Participants reported that structural barriers, such as difficulties in accessing T&CM that was distant from their home or not available at the hospital where they were actively being treated, were often compounded by personal barriers such as a lack of energy to seek further treatments and/or the consequences of travel on their health (Table 5). A few participants commented that \"parking \"at the clinical sites that offer IO services was another structural barrier to access, with disability park- ing providing access for some. Having IO services close to public transport was offered as one solution; so too was community transport. These solutions however, could not completely resolve the challenges of managing personal health constrains and travelling to access such services. Other personal barriers, such as \"Just too many health appointments \",\"Just unable to find the time \", and logis- tical issues related to timing, were also reported by par- ticipants. The various accounts given by participants demonstrate that cancer survivors experience a variety of practical difficulties that prevent them from accessing IO services. Cost of care Out of pocket costs were a significant personal barrier identified by interviewees and survey participants to accessing IO services that reflected a combination of a lack of funding and affordability (Table 5). In the survey, 82% ( n= 69/84) selected finance as an important obs- tacle, from which half reported it was the only obstacle. Participants also emphasised the importance of the con- tinuity of IO services for their effectiveness and, owing to the long recovery time following cancer treatment, the importance of ongoing funding and the need for spe- cialised funding arrangements for IO for cancer patients. A variety of reasons were given as to why cost was a barrier (Table 5). Participants described the costs of their conventional cancer treatment and the ongoing financial pressures of long-term illness as considerable, leaving lit- tle left to pay for extra services such as IO. The limits of private health insurance (high premiums and minimal rebates for T&CM) posed an additional cost barrier toaccessing T&CM. Participants complained about the rebate amount received and the limitations placed on the number of sessions they were allowed. When participants were asked who they thought should pay for all or some of the cost, structural solu- tions were often suggested. Most of the survey respon- dents (86%, n= 92/107) indicated that the national health service (i.e. Medicare) should pay for these ser- vices, followed by 48% ( n= 52) selecting private health insurance and only 23% ( n=2 5 ) t h o u g h t t h e p a t i e n t should directly pay for IO services. Participants saw the Medicare scheme as a just reward for a lifetime of work and taxes, maintai ning that the government should pay for IO through an appeal to rising social inequality (Table 5). Failing adequate subsidies from health services and in- surers, reliance upon family members was identified as a way to help cover costs. Some patients reported that they had searched overseas to improve affordability of T&CM products. Personal constraints associated with engaging in current cancer treatment made it difficult for many to \"shop around \"for the most affordable ser- vices, or to pursue other ways of paying for T&CM such as accessing acupuncture from a medical practitioner. The attitude that IO services were a luxury item was thought to partly explain why both the public and pri- vate health services and insurers were reluctant to fund T&CM. Conversely, participants described T&CM ther- apies as \"an essential part of recovery \",and this was justification for more funding to either partially, or com- pletely, subsidise the cost of IO services (Table 5). Discussion The results from the community survey and focus group interviews align with the findings from other Australia studies [ 3,11,30,31,37,38]. A substantial number of cancer survivors use biological based T&CM therapies and consult T&CM practitioners, both during and after active cancer treatment. Participants expressed a clear preference for their oncology team to informed about their T&CM use and the need for greater integration of high quality T&CM services with their other cancer care services. The demand for IO services appeared to far ex- ceed service provision. Out of pocket costs and insuffi- cient information about IO options were significant barriers that exacerbated unmet need and inequalities. The preferred location of IO services, be they collocated with other cancer services in the hospital or in the com- munity close to home, reflected the logistics of accessing care, severity of impairment and disability, and the loca- tion of other concurrent cancer care. Owing to the long recovery time following initial cancer treatment, con- tinuity of IO care was also emphasised.Hunter et al. BMC Complementary and Alternative Medicine (2018) 18:153 Page 10 of 14This mixed-method study is one of the first in Australia to specifically explore the views of cancer survivors from CALD backgrounds about IO services. Previous research in Australia has mostly focused on T&CM use rather than IO services [ 30,31,38-42], or the need for supportive cancer care services more gener- ally [ 43,44]. The findings from this study also aligned with previous research about the reasons for T&CM use, that is, to augment cancer treatment, increase chances of survival, enhance the immune system, manage side effects, im- prove quality of life and support self-care [ 6,30,45,46]. Participants also emphasised that IO addresses their holistic healthcare needs, helps manage comorbidities, and is an essential part of their ongoing supportive care and rehabilitation. Similarly, among the cancer survivors who did not use, or discontinued using T&CM, the reasons given generally aligned with previous research that identified cost or lack of time; safety concerns, including interac- tions with conventional cancer care; and a lack of evidence as key reasons [ 7]. In contrast however, inad- equate information about T&CM options and IO ser- vices was another important reason for non-use. Participants expressed the need for greater availability of IO services, more affordable IO services, adequate in- formation about IO management options, and improved coordination of care. Accounts of participants suggest that for the most part, it is the cancer survivors and their caregivers who are left with the responsibility of identifying and integrating T&CM therapies and prac- tices. Information about IO options are often limited, particularly for CALD groups. Often, discussions about T&CM with the patient 's oncology team occurs on an ad-hoc basis and is constrained by the healthcare profes- sionals 'attitudes and knowledge. The most substantial barrier to accessing T&CM or more T&CM however, was affordability. The substantial financial burden and out-of-pocket costs to cancer survi- vors in Australia is well documented, affecting patients in both the public and private healthcare sectors [ 23,47]. Participants acknowledged the various challenges with funding IO services and sugges ted higher rebates from pri- vate health insurers and more public funding for the under- served would improve affordability, access and equity. These opinions were in contrast to the findings from a comparable Australian study where the focus group partici- pants considered self-funding to be acceptable and did not expect T&CM to be publicly funded [ 11]. The generalisabil- ity of the earlier study however, was limited by a small sam- ple of patients from a single oncology unit. The challenges with funding and under provision of services are not unique to IO and reflect the increasing unmet needs for all types of supportive cancer care services [ 44,48].The qualitative methods used for the focus group interview enabled the research team to engage with, and explore the views of, CALD groups and this was achieved with varying levels of success through the representation of cancer survivors and caregivers of Chinese, Vietnamese and Arabic backgrounds. In navi- gating a foreign healthcare service, their additional chal- lenges reflect general cultural, language and information barriers that are not necessarily unique to IO [ 26]. The widespread integration of T&CM in Chinese can- cer centres in East Asia, particularly in mainland China, has enabled the building of clinical expertise in IO [ 49]. It should not be surprising then that many participants in the Chinese and Vietnamese focus groups expressed the need to access similar IO services in Australia. In contrast, the Arabic participants had not used T&CM as part of their cancer care and although they were inter- ested in such services, were unaware that IO options existed. The reason is not clear. The observation might be a sampling artefact, as only 11 like-minded people in one focus group were interviewed. Although the inter- viewers specifically inquired about other customary and traditional healing practices, there may still have been communication or cultural barriers since there is evi- dence, that traditional Islamic and Arabic plants are used for cancer care and general health [ 50]. Conversely, there is also evidence suggesting that many Arabic- Australians have uncritically embraced the Western medical model, with community leaders expressing con- cerns about an over reliance on multiple prescription medications [ 51]. Questions about that prayer were not asked, as pastoral care were outside the scope of this research project. This may partly explain the finding that no one had used T&CM as population surveys consistently observe that prayer and spiritual practices are one of the most commonly used non-biological based T&CM therapies in Australia and Arabic coun- tries alike [ 3,30,31,52,53]. Limitations of this study include missing data about the participants 'gender and the sampling strategies that lead to an underrepresentation of CALD groups in the on-line survey, of non-T&CM users (and conversely for T&CM users from Arabic- Australian backgrounds) in the focus group inter- views, and other common CALD groups in Australia, including Aboriginal and To rres Strait Islander peo- ples in both the on-line survey and focus group in- terviews. As such, data saturation may not have been achieved, which in turn limits the generalisabil- ity of the findings. Different methodological ap- proaches and recruitment strategies should therefore be employed to obtain more accounts about demands and barriers to integrating T&CM with conventional care and the provision of IO services.Hunter et al. BMC Complementary and Alternative Medicine (2018) 18:153 Page 11 of 14Results from the quantitative survey data must also be interpreted with caution. Statistics about participants ' characteristics, the use of T&CM, and estimated unmet needs should not be extrapolated and only used to pro- vide contextual background information about the re- spondents. The sample from the community survey was skewed to women who had a diagnosis of breast cancer and users of oncology massage. This reflected the social media networks used to recruit participants to the com- munity survey. As such, the survey sampled a signifi- cantly higher percentage of T&CM users than what is thought to be the rate in Australia [ 30]. However, even the T&CM users experienced substantial barriers to engagement with T&CM services and Australian can- cers survivors with a diagnosis of breast cancer have been found to have the lowest levels of unmet sup- portive care needs [ 44]. Therefore, if anything, the survey was likely to have underestimated rather than overestimated unmet needs. Conclusions Cancer survivors are high users of T&CM and are using these therapies before, during and following active can- cer treatment [ 3,11,30,31,37-42]. Given the demand for T&CM services and a preference by some cancer survivors for these services to be integrated with their conventional cancer care, it is important that oncology teams are well informed about the benefits, risks and in- dications for T&CM use and consider how these services might be provided. This study provided preliminary data to suggest that supportive care services that includes IO, are an important component of quality care in Australia and should not be automatically relegated to a luxury ad-on service for those who can afford them. The chal- lenges with funding IO services and the high out-of- pocket costs for patients were significant barriers that exacerbated inequitable access, particularly for Australians in lower socioeconomic groups, including cancer survi- vors from some CALD groups. Ongoing consultation with cancer survivors is key to appropriate service provision. The health behaviours, preferences and unmet cancer care needs of cancer survivors from a diverse range of CALD and Indigenous backgrounds warrants fur- ther in-depth attention.
