The safe intake limit is three grams a day for adults. In general, babies under the [age of one year](https://www.momjunction.com/articles/babys-11th-month-a-development-guide_00103429/) need 0.5 grams of omega-3 fatty acids a day [(2)](https://www.eatright.org/food/vitamins-and-supplements/types-of-vitamins-and-nutrients/do-kids-need-omega-3-fats). Consult a pediatrician/dietitian to determine the safe intake limit for infants. When Can Babies Have Fish Oil?

However, it is not known if the rule applies to fish oil as well. If your baby consumes fish regularly and it suits him/her, then fish oil also might go well with the baby and contribute to infant nutrition.

The oil is an excellent source of omega-3 fatty acids, such as EPA (eicosapentaenoic acid) and DHA (docosahexaenoic acid), which cannot be synthesized by the body [(4)](https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/fish-oil-friend-or-foe-201307126467). Below are some of the benefits of fish oil. - Brain growth and cognitive development: Omega-3 fatty acids, such as EPA and DHA, are required for proper brain growth and [cognitive development](https://www.momjunction.com/articles/cognitive-development-activities-for-infants_00776696/)in infants [(5)](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Omega3FattyAcids-HealthProfessional/). They also offer neuroprotection and facilitate cognitive development.i [X]Development of a child's intellectual abilities, including information processing, problem-solving, and decision-making They also offer neuroprotection and facilitate neurological development. DHA deficiency, in specific, is associated with poor cognitive developmenti leading to learning difficulties [(6)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10479465-health-benefits-of-docosahexaenoic-acid-dha/). Using fish oil nutritional supplements with a baby's [well-balanced diet](https://www.momjunction.com/articles/top-10-food-ideas-6-months-baby_006689/)after a doctor consultation might help. - Eye development: Various research studies have shown that essential fatty acids, such as DHA (omega-3 fatty acids), may be beneficial in aiding the optimum development of vision [(7)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK11888/).

The omega-3 can possibly lower blood pressure and improve the health of the blood vessels [(9)](https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/omega-3-rich-foods-good-for-your-heart).

These benefits can be relevant to the baby in the long run. - Immunity: The DHA is found to have immunity-enhancing properties [(12)](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2013/04/130401111545.htm).

These benefits are attributed to the omega-3 and omega-6 PUFAs present in it. - Overall health: Besides omega-3 fatty acids, fish oil contains other micronutrients such as iodine, selenium, vitamins A and D, and bioactive compounds. Therefore, regular fish oil intake could help strengthen the immune system and maintain the baby's overall health and well-being. It is believed that consuming fish oil can benefit babies with ADHD and asthma. However, this topic has limited research and more studies are needed to confirm the potential benefits.
