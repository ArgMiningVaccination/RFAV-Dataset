INTRODUCTION 1.1 LUNABOTICS CHALLENGE The Lunabotics Artemis Student Challenge is held at the Astronauts Memorial Foundation's (AM F) Center for Space Education (CSE) Building (M6 -306) at the Kennedy Space Center Visitor Complex (KSCVC). Inside the CSE there are three activity areas, the RoboPits, the Artemi s Arenas and Mission Control. This is an Artemis Student Challenge designed t o educate college students in the application of the NASA Systems Engineering. Participating teams will use this process to design and construct a prototype robot that de monstrates the technologies required for a sustainable human presence on the Moon and other off -world locations . The goal: Earth independence using In-Situ Resource Utili zation (ISRU) technol ogies. Competition rules evolve each year to account for NASA mission objectives and advances in commercially available technology. The competition al lows NASA to gather and evaluate design and operational data for future robotic excavators and builders. Some of the deliverables of this challenge include a Project Management Plan, Public Outreach R eport, Presentation and Demonstration, and a Systems Eng ineering Paper. The complexities the robots will have to master are the abrasive characteristics of the regolith simulants, the resources required to excavate and construct, the weight and size limita tions of the Lunar robot and the ability to operate by r emote control (tele-operate) or through autonomous operations. The commercial cost of delivering payloads to the Moon is about $1.2 Million per kg which corresponds to an approximate mission cost of $ 72 Million. NASA directly benefits from this competitio n by annually assessing student designs and data the same way it does for its own, less frequent, prototypes. E ncouraging innovation in student designs increases the potential of identifying clever solutions to the many challenges inherent in future Artemi s missions. Advances for off -world mining and construction offer new possibilities for the same activities here on Earth, expanding the benefits beyond NASA alone. The skills developed in Lunabotics apply to other high technology industries that rely on Sy stems Engineering principles . These industries will create a workforce posed to lead a new space -based economy and add to the economic streng th of our country. \"Lunabotics is Good for NASA, Good for America, Good for All of Us\" 1.2 CODE OF CONDUCT LUNABO TICS is a National Aeronautics and Space Administration Artemis Student Challenge and is held in a professional, positive, and safe environment.

Technical Performance Measurement: Identify and discuss technical measures that are important to achieving your Design Optimization Criteria (for example: mass, power, data - any technical characteristic that you consi der important, difficult to achieve, or particularly risky to project success), how they are allocated initially to system elements in the system hierarchy, and how that allocation changes as the sys tem design evolves through verification. Demonstrate that the budgeting and management of these important technical quantities was used in the design process. 6. Trade Studies: Discuss how important robot system decisions were made using trade studies, i.e., using weighted evaluation criteria scorings, with key d ecision results captured as robot system derived requirements. 7. Reliability: Discuss design and operations c onsiderations for assuring successful completion of the competition and assur ing safety in the event of a system component failure during operations, captured as key driving requirements. 8. Verification of system meeting requirements: Discuss how you assur e or intend to assure that the as built system satisfies, in the context of t he concept of operations and under the environmental conditions of the competition, all of the key driving requirements identified and discussed in the section addressing Systems Engineering Merit element 4 \"Requirements.\" Discuss how the key important int erfaces were verified. 6.2 PRESENTATION AND DEMONSTRATION (OPTIONAL, 25 POINTS) (VIRTUAL) The Presentation and Demonstration is an optional category in the overall competition and will be judged by a panel of NASA and private industry personnel. This is a virtual presentation, each sc hool will be notified of the platform, date and time of this even t. Each team will be allotted 25 minutes in front of the judging panel. It is expected that the presentation and Lunabotics Guidebook Ver. 4 - 02.23 .2022 demonstration will last approximately 20 minutes with an additional 5 minutes for questions and answers. There is a hard cut -off at the 25 minutes mark to maintain the judging schedule. The slides for the presentation must be submitted electronically in PDF file format. NASA will project these slides onto the screen during the pres entation. Please note that updates and modification to slides are not possible after the deadline, as judges will pre- score the content. Visual aids, such as videos and handouts, may be used during the presentation. Teams are responsible to bring their own display equipment (laptop, phone, tablet, etc.) for video playback. Each subcomponent of the Scoring Elements will be ranked using an adjective ra ting system, with an \"Excellent\" score receiving full credit, \"Very Good\" receiving 70% credit, \"Satisfactory \" receiving 50% receiving 20% credit, and \"Uns atisfactory\" receiving 0% credit. The \"Excellent\" rating is used to account for ex ceptional work (there are no bonus points this year). In case of a tie, the judges will choose the winning pr esentation. The judges' decision is final. Notes on Demonstration 1. Safety is of the utmost importance. You are expected to be aware of the specific hazards associated with your robot and plan safe practices for demonstration. Everyone shall always adhere to safe practices during the demonstration, especially when troubleshooting unexpected issues in real -time. A clear zone shall be established around the robot, and no one shall enter that zone while the robot is in operation. All content from this paragraph shall be addressed when presenting the \"Safety plan\" topic. 2. \"Demonstration\" defined: We prefer that you perform a live demonstration of all functions via the control system, however we recognize that this is not always possible. If parts or the entire robot cannot be controlled at the time of demonstration, it is acceptable to move parts by hand (once the power has been turned off), show video from p ractice runs, etc. to communicate the functionality and attributes of the system and/or subsystems. 3.

RUBRICS FOR P HASE III - MINING 7.1 MINING (25 POINTS) Off-world mining requires teams to consider several design and operations factors such as high robot dust tolerance and minimizing dust projection, efficient communications, minimizing vehicle mass, minimizing en ergy/power required, and maximize autonomy. The goal is to give each team two competition attempts. In each of the two official competition attempt s, the teams will score cumulative mining points. The teams with the first, second and third most mining points averaged from both attempts will receive 25, 20 and 15 points, respectively. Teams not winning first, second, or third place in the mining category can earn one bonus point for each 0.5 kilogram of rock/gravel mined and deposited up to a maximum average of ten points. Each competition attempt will consist of 5 minutes set up, 15 minutes run time, and 5 minutes to safe and remove the robot fro m the arena. If one or both robots cease to operate for a period of 5 minutes, then the Kill Switch will be activa ted on one or both robots and the robot (s) will removed from the arena. All decisions by the Chief Judge are final. Team members shall \"Suit-Up\" a nd don their Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) to place their robot into the arena. The Arena Chief will make the final decision as to who places the robot into the arena, the number of team members allowed into the arena and any other operati onal procedures as required. Teams plan on provid ing one team member for each 20kg of robot mas s. Arena attendants will be available to help teams spot the robot . The goal is for teams to perform two official competition attempts to mine in the arena . A minimum amount of 1.0 kg of gravel must be mined and deposited during either of the two competition attempts to qualify to win in this category. If the minimum amount of 1.0 kg is not met for an attempt, then the total score for that attempt will be zero. In the case o f a tie, the teams will compete in a tie- breaking competition attempt. NOTE: If PPE provisions are limited, the Arena Chief may require NASA staff to place the robot in the arena. Please make allowances for this eventuality. 7.2 SCORING Mining Points Cal culator Mining Category Elements Units Specific Points Example Actuals Example Mining Points 1.

During each competition attempt, the team will earn 10 Mining points for each kilogram in excess of 1.0 kg of rock/gravel deposited in the collector bin. (For example, 11 kg of gravel mined w ill earn 100 Mining points.) The rock/gravel will be sieved out a t the collector bin and weighed separately from the BP-1. Q: Are any cameras at al l allowed on the robot without penalty? ~ and ~ Q: If we bring one system but it has two cameras included, is that a 200 -point deduction for the two cameras together or one 200 pts deduction each? 3. During each competition attempt, the team will lose one (1) mining point for each 50 kilobits/second (kb/s) of average data used. The 200- point deduction is only if you use the competition- provided situational awareness cameras. If a team has cameras on their robot, they will lose one (1) mining point for each 50 kilobits/second (kb/s) of average data used 4. During each competition attempt, the team will lose 200 points fo r each situational awareness camera used (Camera Bandwidth Usage 200 kb/camera). There will be a penalty based on the amount of bandwidth used by each team's robot . If a camera streams data over the network back to mission control, then yes, there will be a penalty . However, if the cameras are used for local vision sys tems on board the robot, then there will not be a penalty. 5. During each competition attempt, the team will lose 8 Mining points for each kilogram of total mining robot mass. (For example, a mi ning robot that weighs 60 kg will lose 480 Mining points). 6. During each competition attempt, the team will lose one (1) Mining point for each watt-hour of energy consumed. The electrical energy consumed must be displayed by an (commercial off the shelf or \" COTS\") electronic power data logger and verified by a judge. 7. During each competition attempt, a team can earn up to 30 Mining points for dust tolerant design features on the mining robot. Teams are encouraged to point out dust tolerant and dust free featur es to the judges during setup. The judges will all ocate these points based on an inspection. The 30 points for dust -tolerant design will be broken down as follows: 1. Drive train and components enclosed/protected: 10 points 2. Active dust control (brushing, elec trostatics, etc.): 10 points 3. Custom dust sealing f eatures (bellows, seals, etc.): 10 points 8. During each competition attempt, a team can earn up to 70 Mining Points for dust free operation. The judges will allocate these points based on actual performance during the competition attempts. If the mining robo t has exposed mechanisms where dust could Lunabotics Guidebook Ver. 4 - 02.23 .2022 accumulate during a lunar mission and degrade the perfo rmance or lifetime of the mechanisms, then fewer Mining points will be earned in this category. If the mining robot raises a substantial amount of airborne dus t or projects it due to its operations, fewer mining points will be earned. Ideally, the mining r obot will operate in a clean manner without dust projection, and mechanisms and moving parts will be protected from dust intrusion. The mining robot will not be penalized for airborne dust while dumping into the collector bin. D ecisions by the judges regar ding dust tolerance and dust projection are final. The 70 points for dust -free operation will be broken down as follows: 1. Driving without dusting up crushed bas alt (20 points) 2. Digging without dusting up crushed basalt (30 points) 3. Transferring crushed basalt without dumping the crushed basalt on your own robot or around the collection bin (20 points) 7.4 MINING POI NTS - COMMUNICATIONS 1. Each team is required to command and monitor their mining robot over the NASA provided network infrastructure. 2. This configura tion must be used for teams to communicate with their robot. 3. The \"Lander\" camera is staged in the Mining Arena. Lander Control Joystick and camera display will be located with the team in the Mission Control Center (MCC). 4. The MCC will have an official timing display. The excavated mass will be displayed after the end of the competition run. 5. Handheld radios will be provided to each team to link their Mission Control Center team members with their corresponding team members in the mining arena during setup. 6. Each team will provide the wireless link (access point, bridge, or wireless device) to their mining robot, whi ch means that each team will bring their own Wi -Fi equipment/router and any required power conversion devices. Teams must set their own network IP addresses to enable communication between their mining robot and their control computers, through their own w ireless link hosted in the Mining arena. 7. In the mining arena, NASA will provide an elevated network drop (male RJ -45 Ethernet plug) that extends to the Mission Control Center, where NASA will provide a network switch for the teams to plug in their laptops. 1. The network drop in the Mining arena will be elevated high enough above the edge of the regolith bed wall to provide adequate radio frequency visi bility of the Mining arena 2. A shelf will be set up next to the network drop at a height 0 to .5 meter above the walls of the arena and will be placed in a corner area on the same side as the collection bin. During robot system operations during the competit ion, there may be some dust accumulation in this area. This shelf is where teams will place their Wireless Ac cess Point (WAP) to c ommunicate with their mining robot. Lunabotics Guidebook Ver. 4 - 02.23 .2022 3. Teams are strongly encouraged to develop a dust protection cover for their wireless access point (WAP) that does not interfere with the radiofrequency signal performance. 4. The WAP shelves for side A and side B of the Mini ng arena will be at least 6 meters apart to prevent electromagnetic interference (EMI) between the units. 8. Power Interfaces 1. NASA will provide a standard US National Electrical Manufacturers Association (NEMA) 5 -15 type, 110 VAC, 60 Hz electrical jack by the network drop. This will be no more than 1.5 meters from the shelf. 2. The team must provide any conversion devices needed to int erface team access points or Mission Control Center computers or devices with the provided power sources. 9. During the setup phase, the teams will set up their access point and verify communication with their mining robot from the Mission Control Center. 10. The teams must use the USA IEEE 802.11b, 802.11g, or 802.11n standards for their wireless connection (WAP and ro ver client). 1. Teams cannot use multiple channels for data transmission; meeting this rule will require a spectral mask or \"maximum spectral bandwidt h setting\" of 20MHz for 2.4 GHz transmission equipment. 1. Encryption is not required, but it is highly encouraged to prevent unexpec ted problems with team links. 2. During a match, one team will operate on channel 1 and the other team will operate on channel 11, See Figure 2. These channels will be monitored during the competition by NASA to assure there are no other teams transmitting on the assigned team frequency. 11. Teams must be able to use and switch between channel 1 and channel 11 for the competition within 15 minutes of being notified to accommodate real -time sch eduling changes. 12. Each team will be assigned an SS ID that they must use for the wireless equipment for channel 1 and channel 11. 1. Teams SSID will be \"Team_##.\" 2. Teams are required to broadcast their SSID. 13. The use of specific low power (these power consumers are not part of the total power consumed COTS mete r) Bluetooth transmission equipment in the 2.4 GHz range is allowed for sensors and other robot communications. Bluetooth is allowed only at power levels of Classes 2, 3, and are limited to a maximum transmi t power of 2.5 mW EIRP. Class 1 Bluetooth devices are not allowed. 14. The use of 2.4 GHz ZigBee technology is prohibited because of the possibility of interference with the competition wireless trans missions. Lunabotics Guidebook Ver. 4 - 02.23 .2022 15. Technology that uses other ISM non- licensed radio frequencies outside of the 2.4 GHz range, such as 900 MHz and 5 GHz, are allowed for robot or sensor systems, but these frequencies will not be monitored during the competition. Interference avoidance will be the responsibility of the Team and will not be grounds for protest by any team. 16. Radio Frequency Power: 1. Team -provided wireless equipment shall operate legally within the power requirements set by the FCC for Unlicensed Wireless equipment operat ing in the ISM radio band. The FCC Federal Regulations are specified in the Electronic Code of Federal Regulations, Title 47, Telecommunication, Part 15, and must be followed if any commercial equipment is modified. Unmodified commercial off the shelf acce ss point equipment and computers already meet this requirement. 2. If a team inserts any type of power ampli ficatio n device into the wireless transmission system, this will likely create a violation of FCC rules and this is NOT allowed in the competition. 3. This radio frequency power requirement applies to wireless transmission devices at any ISM frequency. 17. Data U tilizat ion Bandwidth Constraints 1. Use of the NASA provided situational awareness camera in the control room will add 200 kb/s of data use for each camer a. If the team elects to turn on the camera during the match, they will be charged for the full 200 kb/s of data use. 2. The communications link is required to have an average data utilization bandwidth of no more than 5,000 kb/s. There will not be a peak dat a utilization bandwidth limit. 18. For every kg of robot mass, a typical commercial lunar lander vendor will allow 1 0 kbps bandwidth. Higher bandwidth will result in additional mission costs. Teams are encouraged to stay within this bandwidth allocation and the judges will assess this metric as part of the Communications bandwidth prize. 19. Radio Frequencies and Com municat ions Approval 1. Each team must demonstrate to the communication judges that their mining robot and access point are operating only on their assign ed channel. Each team will have approximately 15 minutes at the communication judges' station. 2. To successfully pass the communication judges' station, a team must drive their mining robot by commanding it from their mining robot driving/control laptop through their wireless access point. The judges will verify the course of travel and verify that the t eam is operating only on their assigned channel. 3. The teams must identify and show to the judges the wireless emission equipment on the robot, including amplif iers and antennas. If the team has added an amplifier, written documentation shall be submitted to the ju dges demonstrating that the limits as designated in these rules for power transmission levels are not being exceeded. 4. If the team robot is transmitting low power Bluetooth, or is using any non- 2.4 GHz frequency equipment, the following information must be provided to the judges during the communications checkout. Printed documentation from the manufacture with part numbers of wireless transmission equipm ent. This printout must be from the manufacturer's data sheet or manual, and will designate the te chnology, Lunabotics Guidebook Ver. 4 - 02.23 .2022 frequency, and power levels in use by this type of equipment. 5. If a team cannot demonstrate the above tasks in the allotted time, the team will be disqualified from the competition. 6. The teams will be able to show the communication judges their com pliance with the rules. 7. The NASA communications technical experts will be available to help teams make sure that they are ready for the communication judges' station. 8. Once the team arrives at the communication judges' station, the team can no longer receiv e assis tance from the NASA communications technical experts. 9. If a team is on the wrong channel during their competition attempts, the team will be disqualifie d and required to power down. Lunabotics Guidebook Ver. 4 - 02.23 .2022 Lunabotics Guidebook Ver. 4 - 02.23 .2022 7.5 MINING POINTS - AUTONOMY Autonomy: During each competition attempt, the team will earn up to 500 Mining points for autonomous operation. As Mission Control Judges (MCJ) are not intimately familiar with each robot's c oncept of operations (ConOps) procedures, it is the sole responsi bility of the team members in the control room to coordinate with and inform the MCJ of each attempt for autonomy points in order to make sure their autonomous attempts are recognized and therefore scored correctly. Mining points will be awarded for successfully completing the following activiti es autonomously: Excavation Automation : 50 pts 1. Teams are allowed to traverse to the Mining Arena via remote control. 2. Once in the Mining Arena they need to indicate to the MCJ that they are going hands free for the excavation attempt. 3. The robot must execute machine control commands itself during the excavation task. 4. The robot must demonstrate the ability to dig through the upper layers of regolith and reach the icy regolith gravel. Hands free operation must begin bef ore the robot engages the regolith to begi n the excavation process. Excavation mechanisms must be completely removed from the regolith and from the excavation hole before returning to remote -control operation. Icy regolith gravel must be deposited in the r obot for transport back to the hopper per the robot's design. Icy regolith gravel deposit in the robot will be at the MCJ judgement (the intent is to show that the robot can dig down to the icy regolith and be successful in bringing up some icy regolith wi th completely hands -free operation). MCJ m ay engage the arena judges for confirmation if camera angle/performance does not allow confirmation in Mission Control. 5. Once excavation is complete the team must indicate they are going to remote control before tak ing control. 6. This level of automation will require teams to master the lower -level machine control of their robot platform associated with excavation. It is noted that past teams have proven this capability to be helpful in achieving better mining results, as the coordination of the robot for exca vation can be difficult to master. Dump Automation: 50 pts 1. Teams are allowed to return to the starting area via remote control. 2. The team must go into autonomous operation immediately after crossing the boundary between the obstacles and starting zones. The intent is that there is not any remote - control operation in the starting zone allowing the operator to \"align\" the robot to the hopper. The remote operator needs to coordinate communication with the M CJ to show hands -free operation when entering the star ting arena. 3. The robot must align, approach, stop, and dump simulated icy regolith into the hopper to be successful. The minimum of 1 kg is not required, however, at least 0.1 kg of icy regolith must be deposited. This will be as weighed by the arena judges . This level of automation will require the team to master localization near the hopper as well as path planning to align and \"dock\" with the hopper. A lso, lower -level machine control of the robot for dumping will be mastered. Lunabotics Guidebook Ver. 4 - 02.23 .2022 Travel Automation: 150 pts Teams may begin in remote control and move the robot within the starting zone only in order to lock i n their localization solution. The teams must then i ndicate to the MCJ that they are going into hands free mode while still in the starting zone. The robot must remain in hands free mode while crossing the obstacle field and crossing into the mining arena. The robot must start in the starting zone and remai n hands free until any part of the robot has crossed into the mining zone (as determined by the MCJ) This level of automation will require the team to master the following: 1. Localization across the entire competition arena 2. Object detection and location relative to the robot 3. Navigational planning based on location and obstacles/traversable area 4. The competition will attempt to construct the obstacle field in such a way as to require obstacle detection and mapping in order to plan an appropriate route to reach the mining arena. \"Point and traverse\" in a straight line will not be possible due to crater and boulder obstacles. 5. If attempting excavation automation in coordination with travel automation the robot must remain in \"hands free\" control during travel and excavation. Full Autonomy (One cycle): 300 pts 1. The robot must be in hands free control for one entire cycle 2. Teams may begin in remote control and move the robot within the starting zone only in order to localize. Teams must begin with hands free control fro m the starting area and remain in hands free mode while crossing the obstacle field and crossing into the mining arena. Remaining in hands free control the robot must excavate simulated icy regolith, return to the collection bin, and successfully deposit s imulated icy regolith at least one time. The minimum of 1kg is not required; however, at least 0.1 kg of icy regolith must be deposited. This will be as weighed by the arena judges. 3. This level requires mastery of all aspects of autonomy associated with this competition. Full Autonomy: 500 pts 1. The robot must be in hands free control for all 15 minutes of the c ompetition run completing two or more cycles of depositing icy regolith. The minimum requirement of 1 kg of icy regolith must be achieved to be awarded this autonomy point level. 2. This level requires mastery of all aspects of autonomy associated with this competition and demonstrates a level of robustness to complete at least two full cycles. System robustness is essential for terrestrial and extra -terres trial mining.

Points will only count for one successful completion - i.e., you can only get 50 points for excavation automation even if you use it for every pass of the run. Combining all three in one pass is the Fully Autonomous - One Cycle level. Lunabotics Guidebook Ver. 4 - 02.23 .2022 8. REQUIREMENTS 8.1 ROBOT REQUIREMENTS 1. The Lunar robot: 1. Shall have maximum undeployed volume = 1.1m lengt h x 0.6m width x 0.6m height. 2. Shall have a maximum mass of 80kg. 3. Shall run either by telerobotic (remote control) or autonomous operation. 4. Subsystems used to transmit commands / data and video to the telerobotic operators are counted toward the mass limit . Equipment not on the robot used to receive data from and send commands to the robot for telerobotic operations is excluded from the mass limit. 5. May deploy or expand beyond the envelop after the start of each competition attempt but shall not ex ceed 1.5 m in height. 6. Multiple robot systems are allowed, but the total mass and starting dimensions of the whole system shall comply with the volumetric dimensi ons given in this rule. The robot does not have to re -assemble at the end of the competition run . 7. The di mensions of the robot can be oriented (length, width, height) along any of the X, Y, Z axis. 2. The \"KILL SWITCH\" - The robot shall be equipped with an easily accessible red emergency stop button or \"Kill Switch.\" Use good engineering practices and principles in placing the \"Kill Switch\" on your robot(s), failure to do so may result in a safety Lunabotics Guidebook Ver. 4 - 02.23 .2022 disqualification. The \"Kill Switch\" shall have a minimum diamet er of 40 mm; it shal l be located on the surface of the construction robot and require no additional steps to access it. Only one \"Kill Switch\" per robot and in the case of multiple robots, each robot will have its own \"Kill Switch.\" It shall be easily acce ssible and activated in an easy and quick manner. Disabling the \"Kill Switch\" without authorization from the Competition Staff shall result in a safety disqualification. The emergency stop button must stop the construction robot's motion and disable power with one push motion on the button. It must be highly reliable and instantaneous. For these reasons an unmodified \"Commercial Off -The- Shelf\" (COTS) red button is required. A closed control signal to a mechanical relay is allowed if it stays open to dis able the robot. This rule exists to have the capability to safe the construction robot in the event of a fire or other mishap. The button should disconnect batteries from motion controllers (high current, forklift type button) and it should isolate the bat teries from the rest of the active sub- systems as well. Only onboard laptop computers and data- logger(s) may stay powered on if powered by its own, independent, internal computer battery. For example: it is acceptable to have a small battery onboard that only powers a Raspberry Pi or equivalent control computer, and whose power does not flow through the main robot kill switch. 3. The robot must provide its own onboard power. No facility power will be provided to the robot during the competition runs. There are no power limitations except that the robot must be self- powered and included in the maximum mass limit. The energy consumed must be recorded with a \"Commercial Off -The-Shelf\" (COTS) electronic data logger device. Actual energy consumed during each compet ition run must be shown to the judges on the data logger immediately after the competition attempt) The \" immediate\" part refers to the judge climbing into the arena, finding the logger and recording the power reading. If the logger is independently powered, then the robot can be remotely powered off after t he run. Although this is acceptable, it is not recomm ended in case the robot needs to be commanded to complete an operation so that it can be removed from the arena. 4. To ensure the robot is usable for an actual mission, it cannot employ any fundamental physical processes, gases, fluids or consumables that would not work in an off-world environment. For example, any dust removal from a lens or sensor must employ a physical process that would be suitable for the Lunar surface. Teams may use processes that require an Earth- like environment (e.g., oxygen, water) only if the system using the processes is designed to work in a Lunar environment and if such resources used by the robot are included in the mass of the robot. Closed pneumatic systems are allowed if the gas is supplied by the robot itself. Pneumatic systems are permitted if the gas is supplied by the robot and self-contained. 5. Components (electronic and mechanical) are not required to be space qualified for Lunar or atmospheric, electromagnetic, and t hermal environments. Since budgets are limited, the compe tition rules are intended to require robots to show an off -world plausible system functionality, but the components do not have to be traceable to an o ff-world qualified component version. Examples o f allowable components are: Sealed Lead- Acid (SLA) or Nic kel Metal Hydride (NiMH) batteries; composite materials; rubber or plastic parts; actively fan cooled electronics; motors with brushes; infrared sensor s, inertial measurement units, and proximity detectors and/or Hall Effect sensors, but proceed at your own risk since BP-1 is very dusty and abrasive. Teams may use honeycomb structures if they are strong enough to be safe and the edges sealed to prevent dust intrusion. Teams may not use GPS, rubber pneumatic tires; air/foam filled tires; open or Lunabotics Guidebook Ver. 4 - 02.23 .2022 closed cell foam, ultrasonic proximity sensors; or hydraulics because NASA does not anticipate the use of these on an off-world mission. Lunabotics Guidebook Ver. 4 - 02.23 .2022 8.2 MINING ARENA Lunabotics Guidebook Ver. 4 - 02.23 .2022 1. The Artemis Arena: 1. Measures ~ 6. 9m x ~ 5.0m 2. Each mining lane is ~ 6.9m long and ~2.5m wide. 3. The excavati on zone is ~2.5m long. 2. The Mining Zone: 1. Contains ~30 cm of BP -1 over a ~15 cm bed of gravel (icy regolith simulant). 2. Larger rocks may also be mixed in with the BP -1/gravel in a random manner 3. Gravel is ~2 cm in diameter . 4. The grate in the sieve is a wire mesh, the openings measure \u00bd\" x \u00bd\". 5. The target sieve is 1.0 meter wide by 0.31 meter deep. The top lip of the sieve as shown in the attached image will be approximately 0.5 meter off the surface of the regolith (50cm +/ - 5cm) 6. The target sieve is 1.0 meter wide by 0.31 meter deep. The top lip of the sieve, as shown, is 0.5 meter off the surface of the regolith. The sieve has a handle that when tightened wi ll stop it from sliding on its track. 3. Surface features will consist of two craters on each side of the arena with three randomly placed obs tacles. The mining robot will be placed in the arena in a randomly selected starting position and direction. Each competition attempt will occur with two teams competing at the same time, one on each side of the arena. There will be a small berm which the robots can drive over the berm or navigate around it. 4. After each competition attempt, the boulder obstacles and craters will be returned to their starting state: 1. There will be at least three (3) boulder obstacles place d on top of the BP -1 surface within the obstacle area before each competition attempt is made. 2. The placement of the boulder obstacles will be randomly selected before the start of the competition. 3. Each obstacle will have a diameter of approximately 30 cm t o 50 cm and will have random heights. 4. There will be at least two (2) craters of varying depth and width, being no wider or deeper than 50 cm. 5. No obstacles will be intentionally buried in the BP -1. The BP-1 includes naturally occurring rocks. 6. The small ber m will be reset to its original height and shape. The height shall not exceed ~1 m. 5. No physical access to the mining robot will be allowed during each competition Lunabotics Guidebook Ver. 4 - 02.23 .2022 attempt. 6. Arena team members are prohibited from pointing out obstacles/arena surface conditions to the Mission Control Center team members. In addition, telerobotic operators are only allowed to use data and video originating from the mining robo t and the NASA video monitors. 7. Visual and auditory isolation of the telerobotic op erators from the mini ng robot in the Mission Control Center is required during each competition attempt. Telerobotic operators will be able to observe the mining arena through overhead cameras in the mining arena via monitors that will be provided by NASA in the Mission Control Center. These color monitors should be used for situational awareness only. 8. No other outside communication via cell phones, radios, other team members, etc. is allowed in the Mission Control Center once each competition attempt begins. During the 5-minut e setup period, a handheld radio link will be provided between the Mission Control Center team members and team members setting up the mining robot in the mining arena to facilitate voice communications during the setup phase only. 8.3 ROBOT PROTOCOL 1. Team s can interact with an interface that allows different pieces of telemetry data to be viewed if there is no real time or other interaction to control or influence the robot. Teams must explain to the attending judge before each competition run how they are interacting with the telemetry system and the judge will observe to ensure compliance with competition rules. The robot's starting direction and location will be randomly selected imme diately before the competition attempt. 2. A mining robot may only excavat e in the respective mining zone at the opposite end of the mining arena from the starting area. Mining is allowed as soon as the mining line is crossed b y the front end of the robot. 3. The mining robot is required to move across the obstacle area to the mini ng zone and then move back to the collection area to deposit the BP -1 and gravel into the collector sieve. Lunabots may drive over or around the berm in each direction. 4. Each team is res ponsible for placement and removal of their mining robot onto the BP-1 surface. There must be one person per 20 kg of mass of the mining robot. Assistance will be provided if needed. Lifting tables will be supplied and judges may assist with this function if there are not enough team members available. 5. Each team has a maximum time of 5 minutes to place the mining robot in its designated starting position within the mining arena; and 5 minutes to remove the mining robot from t he mining arena after the 15-minute competition attempt has concluded and as directed by the Mining Judge. 6. The mining robot operates during the time limit of each competition attempt. The competition attempts for both teams in the mining arena will begin and end at the same time. 7. The mining robot will end operation immediately when the power -off command is Lunabotics Guidebook Ver. 4 - 02.23 .2022 sent, and as instructed by the Mining Judge. 8. The mining robot cannot be anchored to the BP -1 and or rock/gravel surface prior to the beginning of each co mpetition attempt. 9. The mining robot will be inspected during the practice days and right before each competition attempt. Teams will be permitted to repair or otherwise modify their mining robots while the RoboPits are open. 10. At the start of each competition attempt, the mining robot may not occupy any location outside the defined starting position in the mi ning arena. 11. The mining robot must operate within the mining arena; it is not permitted to pass beyond the confines of the outside wall of the arena during each competition attempt . 12. The gravel must be mined in the mining zone and deposited on the sieve fram e. A team that excavates any material from the starting or obstacle areas will be disqualified for that attempt. 13. The gravel must be carried from the mini ng zone to the sieve frame by any means and be deposited on the sieve in its raw state. A secondary container like a bag or box may not be deposited on the sieve. Depositing a container on the sieve will result in disqualification of the team. 14. The mining r obot can separate itself i ntentionally, if desired, but all parts of the mining robot must be always under the team's control . The robot does not have to re - assemble prior to the end of the competition run. 15. Any ramming of the wall may result in a safety disqualification for that attempt at the discretion of the judges. 16. The mining robot must not use the wall as support or push/scoop the gravel up against the wall to accumulate the excavated mass. If the mining robot exposes the mining arena bottom due to excavation, touching the bottom is permitted, but contact with the mining arena bottom or walls cannot be used at any time as a required support to the mining robot. Teams should be prepared for airborne dust raised by either team during each competition at tempt. 17. The mining robot may not use any process that causes the physical or chemical properties of the gravel to be changed or otherwise endangers the uniformity between competition attempts. 18. The mining robot may not penetrate the BP -1 surfac e with more fo rce than the weight of the mining robot before the start of each competition attempt. 19. No ordnance, proj ectile, far -reaching mechanism, etc. may be used. The mining robot must move on the BP -1 surface. 20. No team can intentionally harm another team's mining robot. This includes radio jamming, denial of service to network, gravel manipulation, ramming, flipping, pinning, conveyance of current, or other forms of attack or damage as decided upon by the Lunabotics Guidebook Ver. 4 - 02.23 .2022 judges. Immediate disqualification will result i f judges deem any maneuvers by a team as being offensive in nature. Erratic behavior or loss of control of the mining robot(s) as determined by the judges will be cause for immediate disqualification for that attempt. A judge may disable the mining robot(s ) by pushing t he red \"Kill Switch\" or emergency stop button at any time. 8.4 NAVIGATION PROTOCOL 1. The walls may not be used for the purposes of mapping autonomous navigation and collision avoidance, compasses (analog, digital, etc.) are not allowed on the robot (there are no walls or mapped magnetic fields on off -world locations). Touching or having a switch sensor spring wire that may brush on a wall, or any other surface, as a collision avoidance sensor is also, not allowed. 2. Smaller rock/gravel may be sieved out from t he BP -1 at the collector sieve and weighed separately. The navigational aid system may not be higher than 0.25 m above the sieve frame and cannot be permanently attached or cause alterations (ex: no drilling, nails, screws, etc.). 3. Beacons or targets may be attached to the collector sieve frame for navigation purposes only. Clamps or gravity may be used (tape, screws shall not be used) to hold the devices in place. This navigational aid system must be attached during the setup time and removed afterwards dur ing the removal time. If attached to the sieve frame, it must not exceed the length of the frame (keep the target under 90 cm) and not weigh over 4 kg. 4. Navigation targets can be attached to the vertical PVC pipe uprights that look like goal posts or to the front of the collector sieve if the attached target does not interfere with sliding the sieve back along the two side support rails. Keep the target under 90 cm wide. These are 1.5\" (ID) schedule 40 PVC tubes (vertical uprights) 29\" long that are slid into 2\" (ID) schedule 40 PVC tubes (base sections) 5\" high. The base sections are bolted to the sliding 80/20 sieve frame with 2.5\" ID rigid steel pipe straps. T he sieve frame and track are 80/20 with a 25mm X 25mm T -Slotted Profile. 80/20 hardware compatibl e with the 25 -2525 profile type may be used to temporarily attach navigation targets to it: https://8020.net/25- 2525.html 5. Students can bring their own 1.5\" (ID) schedule 40 PVC tubes (vertical uprights) 29\" long \"goal posts\" integrated into their nav targets as long as 5 inch is clear at the bottom to insert in the 2\" x 5\" high base PVC pieces. 6. The mass of the navigational aid system is included in the maximum mining robot mass limit of and must be self-powered. 7. The target/beacon may send a signal or light beam or use a laser -based detection system which have not been modified (optics or power). Only C lass I or Class II laser or low powered lasers (< 5mW) are allowed. Supporting documentation from the laser instrumentation vendor must be provided to the inspection judges for \"eye- safe\" lasers. 8. Inertial measurement units (IMU) are allowed on the mining r obot. Teams must explain to the judges how the compass feature will be switched off or the compass data is subtracted to ensure the internal calculations do not make use of the compass (from any Lunabotics Guidebook Ver. 4 - 02.23 .2022 magnetic field surrounding the robot). There are no consistent magnetic fields on the Moon. 9. Global Positioning Satellite (GPS) or IMU -enabled GPS devices are not allowed. Teams must explain to the judges how the device will be switched off or the data is subtracted and ensure the internal calculations do not make use of the GPS or IMU - enabled GPS device. 10. Because of actual Lunar hardware requirements, no surface ramps leading to the collector bin of any kind will b e provided or allowed. 11. The team must declare the robot orientation by length and width to the inspectio n judge. An arrow on the reference point (the reference location and arrow pointing forward can be any point and direction of the team's choosing, except up) must mark the forward direction of the mining robot in the starting position configuration. The judges will use this reference point and arrow to orient the mining robot in the randomly selected direct ion and position (you can use a permanent -type marker) indicating the team's choice of forward direction on any location on the robot is acceptable if multiple arrows do not conflict. The arrow does not have to indicate the robot's preferred forward direct ion. The arrow is used only to orientate the robot prior to starting the robot run to face the robot arrow either north, east, south, or west after spinning the direction wheel). 8.5 AUTONOMOUS OPERATIONS 1. For a team to earn mining points in the autonomous category, the team cannot touch the controls during the autonomous period as defined in detail below. Orientation data cannot be transmitted to the mini ng robot in the autonomous period. Lunabotics Guidebook Ver. 4 - 02.23 .2022 2. Telemetry to monitor the health of the mining robot is allowed during the autonomous period. 3. The walls of the mining arena shall not be used for sensing by the robot to achieve autonomy. The team must explain to the inspection judges how their autonomous systems work and prove that the autonomy sensors do not use the walls . There are no walls on off - world locations and teams shall operate as closely as possible on that scenario of operations. Integrity is expected of team members and their faculty advisors. 4. Failure to divulge the method of autonomy sensing shall result in disqualification from the competition. 5. During each competition attempt, the mining robot is limited to autonomous and telerobotic operations only. 6. Team operators are not permitted to update or alter the autonomy program to account / detect or upload inform ation about obstacle locations. 7. Teams can interact with an interface that allows different pieces of telemetry data to be viewed if there is no real time or other interaction to control or influence the robot. Teams must explain to the attending judge before each competition run how they are interacting with the telemetry system and the judge will observe to ensure compliance with all competition rules. Lunabotics Guidebook Ver. 4 - 02.23 .2022 9. COMPETITION INFORMATION 9.1 SAFETY PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT (PPE) The requirement for personal protective equipment (PPE) is to protect the individual from the inherent dangers of crystalline silica (from the crushed lava basalt aggregate) . There are very few options, but the best choice would be for the individual to purchase a hooded powered air purifying respirator (PAPR) - especially if they intend to stay in a career that requires the occasional use of PPE. This requirement exists for the safe ty of the participants . Whatever respirator is selected, it must be NIOSH -approved. [Statement from OSH A - Under OSHA, an employee cannot sign a waiver in order to be exempted from stated requirements. A release or waiver is not possible for employees. Tha t being said when an employer is looking to accommodate a religious practice, t hey may have to explore respiratory protection alternatives like helmets or loose- fitting hoods]. 1. Clothing - Allowed - Shirts/tops that cover upper torso . Long pants that cover the wearer to the ankle. Completely enclosed shoes that cover the instep of the foot, preferably leather which can be wiped clean. Baseball caps and other headgear as long as they are kept far enough back on the head so that vision is not impaired and also do not interfere with protective eyewear. 2. Clothing - Not Allowed - Hair must not impede vision or com e in contact with the work. Hair must be kept away from the eyes. Long hair must be tied back. Hair longer than 6 inches from the nape of the neck must a lso be pinned up (use of hair nets or hats is acceptable). Flowing garments and neckwear such as ties and scarves that hang loose. Caps worn low over the eyes so as to impede vision. Cropped shirts, plunging necklines, spaghetti straps, or ripped shirts . Ripped jeans, shorts, capris, or skirts . Loose or flowing tops with wide/bell sleeves, outerwear such as coats or shawls. Sandals, open toe, open back, or open weave shoes, shoes with holes in the top or sides, no Birkenstocks, Mary Janes, cloth shoes, or C rocs or equivalents that will expose the skin to regolith or retain regolith. 3. Workshop, Safety & Engineering Practices - It is your responsibility to use the correct Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) for the situation. Remember to use hearing protection and eye protection (e.g., safety glasses, goggles or face shield) as needed. Use the right tool for the right job , wear gloves /gauntlets to de -energize robots and equipment as needed, bring jack-stands to support your robot instead of folding chairs, wire strippers should be utilized instead of knives. etc. Remember to use good workshop, safety and engineer ing practices and principles. Bring your own LED lighting for your pit. Surgical or N95 masks are required inside for C OVID precaut ions. Address any safety concerns to the RoboPit Chief immediately. 4. BotShop - Protective eye wear must be worn in the BotShop . Any work requiring protective equipment must be performed in the BotShop. 5. Regolith Simulant - Black Point -1 (BP-1) is a crushed lava basalt aggregate with a natural particle size distribution similar to lunar soil. It is alkaline and may cause skin and eye irritation. If you are allergic to talcum powder, it is a good indication that you may be allergic to the BP -1. Participants are required to don Pers onal Protective Equipment (PPE) before coming into contact with the BP-1. BP-1 contains a small percent age of crystalline silica, which is a respiratory nuisance. Respiratory protection shall be used in accordance with the Lunabotics Guidebook Ver. 4 - 02.23 .2022 manufacturer's operating instruct ions and your school's respiratory protocols at a minimum. Without exception, the use of any respirator (N-95 masks and/or tight -fitting negative pressure respirators, etc.) shall require a clean, shaven face. No facial hair shall be in contact with any part of the mask/respirator in order to maintain the seal. 6. Icy-Regolith Simulant - Limestone gravel #57 is used as the simulant. 7. Fire Exits / Eyewash Stations - Know where the fire exits, fire extinguishers and eyewash stations are located. Each team is re sponsible for bringing a First -Aid kit and respirator masks for use in the RoboPits for team members . Report any safety concerns to the RoboPits Chief. 8. Stop Work Order (SWO) - Lunabotics staff are authorized to issue a SWO to a team on any suspected safety issue. The team will immediately stop all activity. The Faculty Advisor must meet with the RoboPit Chi ef to resolve the issue. The SWO will remain in effect until the RoboPit Chief has issued a ruling on the issue. The RoboPit Chief decision is final . 9. Rem inder - If your team uses any kind of military container, (ex. \"ammo cans\") please spray - paint or cov er up the former military content signage so we can avoid any work stoppages due to extra security checks. 10. Controlled Substances - The consumption of alcoholic beverages or use of any controlled substances by a team member during the event is prohibited. V iolation is grounds for disqualification of the team. 11. Weapons - No weapons of any kind are permitted inside Kennedy Space Center Visitor Complex, including those belonging to off -duty law enforcement. Please leave items secured within your vehicle to expedi te your entry into the visitor complex. Violation is grounds for disqualification of the team. For example, COTS wire strippers should be utilized instead of knives. 12. Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV), Unmanned Aerial Systems - The use of Unmanned Aircraft Systems (Drones) is prohibited at the Kennedy Space Center Visitor Complex and the Astronauts Memorial Foundation Center for Space Education. The UAV/UAS wi ll be confiscated and not returned. Violation is grounds for disqualification of the team. 13. Wildlife - There are alligators, ants, armadillos, mosquitoes, raccoons, snakes, and wild hogs . Do not attempt to feed or interact with the wildlife in any manner. 14. Florida Weather - Stay hydrated, drink plenty of water. You and your off -world mining robot s will be ex posed to the Florida weather so be prepared for heat, humidity, wind and rain. You are responsible for protecting your robot from the elements while outd oors. Remember to have hats, sunglasses, insect repellent, sunscreen (SPF 50 or better) and a raincoat / poncho on hand for the competition. Florida is the Lightning Capital of the U.S., and the lightning phase conditions are as follows: Phase I Lightning Condition - prepare to seek shelter. Phase II Lightning Condition - seek shelter NOW in any building. Lunabotics Guidebook Ver. 4 - 02.23 .2022 9.2 ROBOPIT PROTOCOL You are responsible for checking in with the RoboPits Chief upon arrival on Day 1. The RoboPits Chief will explain the process for inspections, signing up for runs, and RoboPits protocols. The RoboPits Chief is your only point of contact to coordinate runs. When things get hectic, be professional. The RoboPits Chief will require two contact phone numbers, in case the team needs to be reached at any point during the competition and cannot be found. These numbers will not be shared with anyone and will be deleted of at the end of the competition. Each team will keep their team and equipment contained within their assigned pit and keep t he walkways /hallways clear and unobst ructed. No more than five (5) team members and one (1) faculty adv isor will be allowed in the RoboPits at any time. 1. General Instructions 1. Communication (Comm) and Vehicle Inspection locations will be identified. 2. Either i nspection can be performed first, they are not scheduled, they are on a first - come, first -served basis. 3. Return the C/I card when you have passed both the Comm and Inspection checks and are ready to compete. 4. Let the RoboPits Chief know if the team is going to the sandbox and will go from there to the arena for your practice run. 5. The RoboPits Chief will give the team leader the Comm/Inspection (C/I) card. The C/I card is to ensure that all teams have had their robot(s) checked out prior to entering the arena. 2. RoboPit Guide 1. Teams wil l need a placard to get through the Complex Security Gates. 2. Check robots out wi th the RoboPits Chief prior to leaving the Complex for the day, if taking the robot out. 3. All pits have power strips provided. Do not daisy chain power st rips. 4. There is general area lighting in the RoboPits, t eams are encouraged to bring their own LED lighting. 5. Prior to each competition run, an escort will come to the RoboPit to retrieve the team; do not leave without the escort. 6. NASA provided carts are for shared use by all teams. Use carts to transport robots only. Carts are NOT for use in your pit. Carts are not platforms for working on the robots. Teams headed to t he arena for competition and going to presentations have priori ty on carts. 7. It is recommen ded that the team be ready with the robot on a cart, 45 minutes (TBV) prior to the scheduled competition start time, to ensure a smooth flow. Lunabotics Guidebook Ver. 4 - 02.23 .2022 8. The competition schedule will be sent out in the afternoon to the team's point of contact. On competition days, teams will be brought to inspection 30 minutes (TBV) before the scheduled competition run start time. 9. Following the inspection, the escort will take the team to the arena, where arena escorts will take over. If the team is not ready or cannot be located, the competition run time will be given to another team that is ready. 10. Vacuums are provided. They are for s hared use by all teams as needed. Return vacuums to the designated area. Notify the RoboPits Chief about vacuums that need to be cleaned. 3. Clean- up and C heck- out 1. Teams will check with the RoboPit Chief at check -in regarding any issues with shipping the robot s home after the competition. There will be a designated area for those robots being shipped, do not assume it can be left in your pit. 2. Each night the RoboPit is expected to be neat, with nothing outside of the pit boundaries. Keep the RoboPit and the s urrounding area neat and generally clean; use the provided vacuums as necessary. You are encouraged to bring floor cover ings/mats to facilitate this clea ning. 3. Each team will leave their RoboPit as they found it. Teams are required to clean their pit and the area around it. Teams will request a RoboPit inspection from the RoboPit Chief prior to departure. 4. Waste Accumulation Protocol Teams will comply with F ederal and Kennedy Space Center hazardous and controlled waste program requirements.

During the past 45 years , he has participated in the design, development, and testing of Mercury, Gemini, Apollo, Skylab, and Space Shuttle spacesuits, as well as numerous advanced technology configuration spacesuits and EVA gloves for future mission applications. Kosmo received the American Astronautical Society's Victor A. Prather Award, the NA SA Exceptional Service Medal, and the Astronaut Silver Snoopy Award. He has pursued the development of advanced spacesuits, gloves, and ancillar y EVA- supporting hardware concepts for futur e planetary surface exploration. In 2011, he retired from NASA after a 50-year career in the space industry. This award honors his service and contributions to America's space program. The winner of the Joe Kosmo Award for Excellence is calculated as follows: + Project Management Plan (10 Points) + Systems Engineering Paper (25 Points + Presentation and Demonstration (Optional) (25 Points) + Public Outreach Report (15 Points) + Mining (25 Points) = Joe Kosmo Awar d for Excellence Winner Mining Award - 1st, 2nd, 3rd Places Teams are required to design and build a mining rob ot that can traverse the simulated Lunar chaotic terrain. The robot must then excavate the icy regolith simu lant (gravel) and return the excavat ed mass for deposit into the Collector Bin to simulate an off-world mining mission. The teams will have two, 15 -minute competition runs to mine the icy regolith. The Efficient Use of Communications Power Award Awarded for using the lowest average data util ization bandwidth per icy regolith point ear ned in the official runs. Teams must also collect the minimum amount of simulated icy regolith to qualify for this award. The Judges Innovation Award Awarded for the best design based on creative construction, innovative technology, and overall architectur e. The Caterpillar Autonomy Awards: 1st - 6th Places The intent of t he rules structure for autonomy are to incentivize competitors to pursue Lunabotics Guidebook Ver. 4 - 02.23 .2022 autonomy and develop skil ls in the area of on -board autonomy - percepti on, localization, planning, and machine cont rol. The structure has been established to reward teams for automati on of portions of the operational cycle of the competition. Automation of portions of the cycle al lows teams to build capability leading to full autonomy. It should be noted that historica lly several teams have leveraged automation to improve their remote- control performance. Excavation automation is a great example of this approach. Systems Engineering Paper Award - 1st, 2nd, 3rd Places Papers should discuss the Systems Engineering (SE) methods used to design and build the mining robot. The purpose of the SE paper is to encourage the teams to use the SE process while designing, building, and testing their robots.

GLOSSARY OF TERMS 1. Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology: The Competition rules and rubrics are align ed the ABET requirements for engineering and engineering technology accreditation. (http://www.abet.org ) 2. Astronaut Me morial Foundation's Center for Space Education (CSE): Located adjacent to the northwest end of the Kennedy Space Center Visitor Complex (KSCVC), at the Eastern terminus of Florida S.R. 405 in building M6 -306. 3. Autonomous: The operation of a mining robot wit h no human interaction. 4. Basaltic Regolith Properties: Since the properties of regolith vary and are not well known, this competition will assume that basaltic regolith properties are similar to the Lunar regolith as stated in the \"Lunar Sourcebook: A User 's Guide to the Moon\", edited by G. H. Heiken, D. T. Vaniman, and B. M. French, copyright 1991, Cambri dge University Press (https://www.lpi.usra.edu/lunar_s ourcebook/ ) . 5. Black Point -1 (BP -1): Both parameters (coefficient of friction and cohesion) are highly dependent on the humidity and compaction (bulk density, porosity) of the Lunar soil. Note the following: 1. It does not behave like sand. 2. The coefficient of friction has not been measured. 3. There are naturally occurring rocks in the aggregate. 4. BP-1 is made from crushed basalt fines and not commercial ly available. 5. See \"Soil Test Apparatus for Lunar Surfaces\" http://www .nasa.gov/nasarmc 6. The density of the compacted BP -1 aggregate will be between 1.5 g/cm3 and 1.8 g/cm3 7. BP-1 behaves like a silty powder soil wit h most particles under 100 microns in diamet er. 8. Will be compacted and the top layer will be raked to a fluffy co ndition of approximately 0.75 g/cm3, similar to the Lunar surface. 9. Teams are encouraged to develop or procure simulants based on basaltic minerals and lunar surface regolith particle size, shape, and distribution. 6. Black Point -1 (BP -1) Reflectivity: NASA pe rformed tests to answer questions about BP -1 reflectivity for LIDAR (or other LASER -based) navigation systems. The laser is not a beam - it is spread out as a sheet that is oriented in the vertical direction, so it is draped across the BP -1 and across a wh ite/gray/black target that is standing up behind the BP -1 in the images. The BP -1 is the mound at the bottom of each image. Teams can get the reflectivity of the BP -1 by comparing the Lunabotics Guidebook Ver. 4 - 02.23 .2022 brightness of the laser sheet seen reflected from the BP -1 with the brightness of the same sheet reflected from the white and black portions of the target. The three images are for the three angles of the laser. Note the BP -1 is mounded so they need to account for the fact that it is not a flat surface if they choose to analyz e the brightness in the images. The three pictures below were shot with the camera at 10, 16, and 21 degrees relative to the surface. The laser was at an angle of 15 degrees. The camera sp eed and aperture were set to (manual mode): 1/8 s, f/4.5. 10 Degree 16 Degree 21 Degree 7. Collector Bin: A collector bin in the mining arena for each competition attempt into which each team will deposit the excavated mass. The collector bin will be large enough to accommodate each team's excavated rock/gravel and BP -1. The collector bin will be stationary and located inside the mining arena. 8. Competition attempt: The operation of a team's mining robot intended to meet all the requirements for winning the mining category by performing the functional task. The du ration of each competition attempt is 15 minutes. 9. Excavated mass: Mass of the excavated rock/gravel deposited to the collector bin by the team's mining r obot during each competition attempt, measur ed in kilograms (kg) with official result recorded to the nearest one tenth of a kilogram (0.1 kg). 10. Functional task: The excavation of rock/gravel from the mining arena by the mining robot and deposit of the exca vated mass from the mining robot into the collector bin. 11. Kennedy Space Center Visitor Complex: Located at the eastern terminus of Florida S.R. 405. 12. Lunar regolith density: The density of regolith at the Apollo 15 landing site averages approximately 1.35 g/ cm3 for the top 30 cm, and it is approximately 1.85g/cm 3 at a depth of 60 cm. The regolith also include s breccia and rock fragments from the local bedrock. About half the weight of lunar soil is less than 60 to 80 microns in size. 13. Mining arena: Located in the Astronaut Memorial Foundation's Center f or Space Education (CSE) where the mining robot will perform each competition attempt. 14. Mining robot: An autonomous or tele- operated robotic excavator including mechanical and Lunabotics Guidebook Ver. 4 - 02.23 .2022 electrical equipment, batteries, gase s, fluids, and consumables delivered by a team to compete in the competition. 15. Mining points: Points earned from the two competition attempts will be averaged to determine ranking in the on -site mining category. 16. Mission Control: Operations area where teams will operate or autonomously control their r obotic excavator to simulation a lunar In- Situ Resour ce Utilization (ISRU) mining mission. It is located outside of the arenas. 17. Reference point: A fixed location signified by an arrow showing the forward direction on the mining robot that will serve to ver ify the starting orientation of the mining robot within the mining arena. 18. Rock/Gravel: The gravel is #57 limestone gravel (~2 cm in diameter) and is i ntended to simulate the icy-regolith buried in the South Polar region of the Moon. will be but will have r andom particle sizes larger than that also mixed into the gravel. The rock/gravel may be mixed in with the BP -1 in small quantities. 19. Telerobotic: Communication with and control of the mining robot during each com petition attempt must be performed solely through the provided communications link which is requi red to have a total average bandwidth of no more than 5.0 megabits/second on all data and video sent to and received from the mining robot.
