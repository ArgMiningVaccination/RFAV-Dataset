East Meets West: The Chinese Experience in Montana Educational Resources Footlockers, Slides, and Videos (continued)\u2014 13 \u2014East WestEast Meets West: The Chinese Experience in Montana Primary Sources and How to Use Them The Montana Historical Society Education Office has prepared a series of worksheets to introduce you and your students to the techniques of investigating historical items: artifacts,documents, maps, and photographs. The worksheets introduce students to the common practiceof using artifacts, documents, maps, and photographs to reveal historical information. Throughthe use of these worksheets, students will acquire skills that will help them better understand thelessons in the User Guide. Students will also be able to take these skills with them to futurelearning, i.e. research and museum visits. These worksheets help unveil the secrets of artifacts,documents, maps, and photographs. See the examples below for insight into using these worksheets. Artifacts Pictured at left is an elk-handled spoon, one of 50,000 artifacts preserved by the Montana Historical Society Museum. Here are somethings we can decipher just by observing it: It was hand-carved from ananimal horn. It looks very delicate. From these observations, we might conclude that the spoon was probably not for everyday use, but for special occasions. Furtherresearch has told us that it was made by a Sioux Indian around 1900.This artifact tells us that the Sioux people carved ornamental items, theyused spoons, and they had a spiritual relationship with elk. Photographs This photograph is one of 350,000 in the MontanaHistorical Society Photographic Archives. After looking atthe photograph, some of the small \"secrets\" that we canfind in it include: the shadow of the photographer, therough fence in the background, the belt on the woman'sskirt, and the English-style riding saddle. Questions that might be asked of the woman in the photo are: Does it take a lot of balance to stand on a horse, is ithard? Was it a hot day? Why are you using an English-style riding saddle? MONTANA HISTORICAL SOCIETY MONTANA HISTORICAL SOCIETY (continued)\u2014 14 \u2014Documents This document is part of the Montana Historical Society's archival collection.Reading the document can give us a lot ofinformation: It is an oath pledging to catchthieves. It was signed by 23 men inDecember of 1863. It mentions secrecy, soobviously this document was only meant tobe read by the signers. Further investigation tell us that this is the original Vigilante Oath signed by the VirginiaCity Vigilantes in 1863. The two things thisdocument tell us about life in Montana in the1860s are: there were lots of thieves inVirginia City and that traditional lawenforcement was not enough, so citizens tookto vigilance to clean up their community. Maps This map is part of the map collection of the Library of Congress. Information that can begathered from observing the map includes: The subject of the map is the northwestern region ofthe United States\u2014west of the Mississippi River.

It tookover a month via ship to travel the distancebetween China and America\u2014a trip that cost$50. Many Chinese came to Montana andthe West in search of gold. They wereheaded to a place called \"Gum San\" (GoldMountain) where they were told they wouldfind gold nuggets the size of oranges.Problems in China forced many to leave.During the Taiping Rebellion, more than 20million people died. Comparatively, only onemillion people died during the Civil War inAmerica. Drought and further fighting alsohelped thousands of Chinese men make theirdecision to come to America. They wantedto make their fortune in America during theGold Rush and help their families by sendingmoney back home. The 1870 Montana census records about 2,400 Chinese living in Montana. In the cityof Butte alone, there were 98 Chinese in1870. Chinese men came to the UnitedStates, and especiallyMontana, in search of goldduring the Gold Rush. Afterthe rush ended, manystayed in Montana asrailroad workers or openedtheir own laundry or shopsthat provided Chinese food,herbs, newspapers, andcompanionship to visit withother Chinese and chatabout their homeland. Chinese Men and Women There were many more Chinese men than women inMontana during the 19thand early 20th centuries.Some of the earliestChinese women in Montanawere either prostitutes, soldby their families in China, or wives of wealthy businessmen who had the money to pay theirtraveling expenses. Due to the expensive$50 travel cost, only wealthy Chinese menwere able to afford Chinese wives. FewChinese men married outside their race - itwas illegal to do so after 1909, according toMontana law. Mining and the Railroad Chinese miners often worked on placer minesthat had already been worked by whiteminers. After the bust of the Gold Rush, theChinese helped build railroads. For example,many Chinese moved to Montana to helpbuild the Northern Pacific in the 1880s. Atone time there were over 12,000 Chineserailroad workers in Montana. They workedfor half the wage a white railroad worker waspaid, receiving only $1 a day. However, itwas much more than they could make backin their homeland of China. Chinese workerswere generally used for the very difficult andrisky jobs associated with the railroad. Butbecause the money was so good, they werevery interested in undertaking such risks. Historical Narrative for Fourth Graders continued Interior of a Chinese Temple, Virginia City, Montana, no date. MONTANA HISTORICAL SOCIETY\u2014 23 \u2014After the Railroad Once the railroad was built, many Chinese decided to stay in Montana. They chosesmall businesses that didn't require a lot ofmoney to start. Some became tailors, ranchcooks, gardeners, woodcutters, vegetablegrowers, and herbal doctors. Others openedlaundries and restaurants. Chinese Customs and Religion Other Montana immigrants consideredChinese to be exotic heathens. They dressedand talked strangely, and wore their hair inlong braids like women or Indians. MostAmericans and other immigrants did notknow that Chinese men were required towear their hair this way in China as a sign ofloyalty and, if they refused, were put todeath. Few white \"Christian\" settlers realizedthat among the \"heathen Chinese,\" there wasa large number of devout Christians who hadbeen converted by missionaries before leavingChina. Their diet was strange to men who ate a \"heart-healthy\" fare of meat mixed with flour,beans or bread. One anti-Chinese petitionargued that the Chinese should be deportedbecause \"they eat rice, fish and vegetablesand that otherwise their diet differs from thatof the white man.\" Chinese railroad workerswho demanded hot tea to drink were laughedat until those who made fun of them becamesick after drinking unboiled groundwater.Chinese were denounced for their use ofopium by the same folks who used Americanmedicines laced with strong drugs and drankwhiskey to relieve physical and emotionalpain. The ignorance by Americans and other immigrants was made legal throughout theWest by laws that punished only Chinese. Chinese in Montana were not allowed tobecome citizens, vote, own property, ormarry non-Chinese after 1909. Special taxeswere created that only applied to Chinesewho owned laundries or worked as miners.Many newspapers often discriminated againstthe Chinese. The first reported hanging in Butte was of a Chinese miner hung by Dan Haffie becausethe Chinese man seemed to be getting all of the luck in the diggings on Silver Bow Creek.There is no record of whether Haffie's luckimproved after he hung his Chinese neighbor. Federal laws from 1882 until 1943 placed the burden on the individual to prove whythey should not be deported to China andrandom arrests were frequent. Chinatowns,that offered some sanctuary fromdiscrimination as well as a common culture,sprang up in the larger towns of the state. In Alder Gulch, about 500 Chinese miners built a Chinatown in Virginia City with a two-story wooden religious temple. As the goldboom faded there, many of the Chinesemoved on to mining camps where thediggings were still paying off or they startedbusinesses in growing towns like Anaconda,Billings, Butte, Deer Lodge, Dillon, andHelena. Butte was home to Montana'slargest Chinese community despite organizedefforts to evict them. By 1910, Butte'sChinese population had grown to 2,532,according to Rose Hum Lee, who wrote thebook The Chinese in the United States of America . She was born and raised in Butte. As labor unions gained strength in the 1880s and the 1890s, they organized boycotts toevict Chinese businesses. In the winter of1896-1897, anti-Chinese union membersblocked doorways and discouraged customersfrom entering Chinese restaurants andlaundries. As the boycott went on, someChinese feared the violence that had alreadyerupted in riots against Chinese in Tacoma,Washington, Denver, Colorado, and Rock Springs, Wyoming and they decided to leavefor the safety of larger Chinatowns on thewest coast. In Anaconda, violence did eruptwith at least one Chinese laundry beingbombed in 1890. Today there are very few Chinese left in Montana, but they left a wonderful legacy ofhard work and dedication.

Many Chinese came toMontana and the West in search of gold.They were headed to a place called \"GumSan\" (Gold Mountain) where they were toldthey would find gold nuggets the size oforanges. Although there was a strong pushto find gold in the Americas, another reasonfor making the long trip was the chaos of late19th century China. During the TaipingRebellion, led by Hong Xiuquan - a Chineseman who thought he was the older brother ofJesus Christ - more than 20 million peopledied. (To put this number into perspective,only 1 million people died during the CivilWar in America.) Drought and further fighting also helped thousands of Chinesemen make their decision to come to America.They wanted to make their fortune inAmerica and help their families by sendingmoney back home. The 1870 Montana census recorded approximately 2,400 Chinese living inMontana. In the city of Butte alone, therewere 98 Chinese in 1870. Chinese mencame to the United States, and especially toMontana, in search of gold during the GoldRush. After the rush ended, many stayed onas railroad workers or opened their ownlaundry or shops that provided Chinese food,herbs, newspapers, and companionship forother Chinese in America to visit and chatabout their homeland. Chinese Men and Women Chinese men far outnumbered women in the19th and early 20th centuries. Some of theearliest Chinese women in Montana wereeither prostitutes, sold by their families in China, or wives of wealthy businessmen, whohad the money to pay their travelingexpenses. Few Chinese men married outsidetheir race, as it was illegal to do so after1909 according to Montana law.

Chinese Customs and Religion Other settlers considered Chinese to beexotic and inscrutable heathens. They dressedand talked strangely, and wore their hair inlong braids like women or Indians. Fewcould imagine that they were required toHistorical Narrative for Instructors continued\u2014 25 \u2014wear their hair this way in China as a sign of loyalty. If a Chinese man refused to wear hishair in a braid, the penalty was death. Fewwhite \"Christian\" settlers realized that amongthe \"heathen Chinese,\" was a large number ofdevout Christians who had been converted bymissionaries before leaving China. Their diet was strange to men who ate a \"heart-healthy\" fare of meat mixed with flour,beans or bread. One petition argued that theChinese should be deported because \"they eatrice, fish, and vegetables and that otherwisetheir diet differs from that of the white man.\"Chinese railroad workers who demanded hottea to drink were laughed at, until those whoscoffed became ill from dysentery afterdrinking unboiled groundwater. Chinesewere denounced for their use of opium by thesame folks who used patent medicines lacedwith laudanum and morphine and drankwhiskey straight to relieve physical andemotional pain. Unlike simple prejudice, however, this ignorance was validated throughout the Westby discriminatory laws that punished onlyChinese. Chinese in Montana were notallowed to become citizens, vote, ownproperty, or marry non-Chinese after 1909.Special taxes were levied that only applied toChinese who owned laundries or worked asminers. These laws encouraged many to acton their prejudices with impunity. Thenewspapers of the day abound with reportsof beatings and harassment against Chinese. The first reported hanging in Butte was of a Chinese miner hung by Dan Haffie becausethe Chinaman seemed to be getting all of theluck in the diggings on Silver Bow Creek.There is no record of whether Haffie's luckimproved after he hung his Chinese neighbor. Federal laws from 1882 until 1943 placed the burden on the individual to prove whythey should not be deported to China andrandom arrests and interrogations werefrequent.Chinatowns, offering sanctuary from discrimination as well as a common culture,sprang up in the larger towns of the state. In Alder Gulch, about 500 Chinese miners built a Chinatown in Virginia City with a two-story wooden religious temple. As the goldboom faded there, many of the Chinesemoved on to mining camps where thediggings were still paying off or they startedbusinesses in growing towns like Anaconda,Billings, Butte, Deer Lodge, Dillon, andHelena. Butte was home to Montana'slargest Chinese community despite organizedefforts to evict them. By 1910, Butte'sChinese population had grown to 2,532,according to Rose Hum Lee, who wrote The Chinese in the United States of America.She was born and raised in Butte. As labor unions gained strength in the 1880s and the 1890s, they organized boycotts toevict Chinese businesses. In the winter of1896-1897, union members blockeddoorways and discouraged customers fromentering Chinese restaurants and laundries.As the boycott went on, some Chinese fearedthe violence that had already erupted in riotsagainst Chinese in Tacoma, Washington,Denver, Colorado, and Rock Springs,Wyoming and they decided to leave for thesafety of larger Chinatowns on the westcoast. In Anaconda, violence did erupt withat least one Chinese laundry being bombed in1890. Hundreds of Chinese immigrantsended up leaving Montana, fearing for theirlives. Today there are very few Chinese left in Montana, but their predecessors left awonderful legacy of hard work anddedication.

I was alreadya well-established physician in China, butdecided to make the long trip to the UnitedState, in particular Montana, because I heardthat the many Chinese workers neededChinese physicians. It was hard starting out as a Chinese physician in Butte, Montana during the1800s because so many white Americanslooked down on us Chinese and discriminatedagainst us. But I ended up being a well-respected and even quite wealthy man inButte. Chinese medicine and acupuncture was thousands of years old in the late 1800s andI brought not only my knowledge of itspower, but also many of the ingredients likeChinese herbs necessary to make theremedies. I cured many Chinese people fromsimple to very complex ailments in Butte.After a while, some of the white Americanseven began getting treated by me. I enjoyedmeeting new people and helping anyone thatI could. In the early 1900s I saved a very sick and wealthy young woman - the daughter ofWilliam Andrews Clark, one of the ButteCopper Kings. She had a terrible ulcer that Iwas able to successfully cure with an herbalpoultice made from banana stalks. You mightbe wondering how I got these to Butte? Thelocal mercantile store had a good shippingsystem, where anything that I needed couldbe sent to me. But in 1918 my reputation as a well- established physician was greatly boostedwhen I helped to save many men from aterrible influenza (flu) epidemic. During thatyear, hundreds of people, who would not visit my practice to receive the effective herbaltreatment, died. Although I was a very skilled physician, I could not save my wife, Chong Chie Huie,who died in 1923 after eating food from acan with botulism (an extremely dangerousfood poisoning caused by harmful bacteria). Iwas very sad about my wife's death. She waspeacefully buried in the Chinese section ofButte's Mount Moriah Cemetery. I had hopedthat she would be returned to our nativeChina, but since Butte became home to us, itis a good final resting place.Amazing Montanans\u2014Biographies Dr. Huie Pock Dr. Huie Pock, October Montana MONTANA HISTORICAL SOCIETY\u2014 29 \u2014East WestEast Meets West: The Chinese Experience in Montana People around here call me Polly. That's not my realname, but everyone has ahard time pronouncingChinese names, so mostChinese women are calledPolly. I was born in a verysmall province in China in1852. My family was verypoor - at one time we raisedsheep and then we tried toraise grains, but it was veryhard due to the poor soiland harsh weather. When I was 18 years old my father sold me to a band ofbandits in exchange for onesack of seed. I was very sadto leave my family and Ididn't know where I was goingto end up. The last words my father said tome was, \"Obey my husband,\" as he handedme a traditional wedding veil. The clothes onmy back and this veil were all that I owned. After a very long trip on a ship for many days, I arrived in San Francisco. From SanFrancisco I traveled to Montana on horsebackwith a Chinese cowboy. It was nice to havesomeone to talk to on that long trip fromCalifornia to Montana. That trip took almosttwo weeks. A man from China, who was verywealthy from the gold mines, bought me sightunseen for $2,500 to make me his wife. Thatsure was a lot of money in those days, but hehad to pay for my travel, which was expensive.Most of the Chinese in the United Statesduring the 1850s \u2014early 1900s were men.Many Chinese men wanted Chinese wives, butit cost so much to bring us over. So they hadto work very hard and save their money.When I arrived in the United States, I couldn't speak any English and I was veryconfused - so many different sights, smells,and sounds. The people looked different,the buildings were strange, and the food wasunlike anything I had ever tasted. But Ilearned quickly about the white man's cultureand language. I married and had three children. Our children grew up in and remained inMontana, never visiting China. But wetaught our children about their Chineseculture, teaching them to speak and writeChinese, about our customs, and nationalfoods. Although I didn't know my husbandbefore we married, we lived a long andhappy life in Montana, at times dreaming ofChina and the lives we left behind.

Vocabulary List\u2014 31 \u2014East WestEast Meets West: The Chinese Experience in Montana Lesson 1: What Would You Bring? Pre-Lesson Preparation The trip to Montana for the Chinese, as well as many other immigrants in the 1800s and early 1900s, was very long. Somepeople had to travel via ship for many months and then spendadditional weeks in transit via horseback or wagon to reach theirfinal destination. Not only were trips long, oftentimes there wasnot much room for people to bring personal items. Maybe therewould be room for one small suitcase per person or family,which would not be much room at all! People generally worethe only clothing they brought with them, maybe a few personalitems, and things that would remind them of their homeland.But with not a lot of space, they had to be very picky aboutwhat they could and could not bring. Procedure: 1. Show the items you would bring with you on a trip to Montana with the students. Remind students these areitems that you must carry with you. 2. Show students the Chinese clothing and hat from the footlocker. 3. Have everyone make a journal using the \"Journal Activity\" found in the User's Guide. This will take the rest of theclass period. 4. During the next class period, ask everyone to take out his or her newly made journal. Tell students they will beimmigrating to China. Then ask students to do thefollowing in their journal: a. List the two essential things they would take with them to China. Remember, students must carry theseitems with them. b. List the two things to help them remember Montana and the United States and why. Remember, studentsmust carry these items with them. c. Draw pictures of these items. d. Draw pictures of the animals, plants, people, etc. that they will encounter in China and what the countrysidewill look like. Discussion Questions: 1. Have students share their journals. What items did they choose to bring? Are there many similar items? Whatdifferent items are there?Objective: At the conclusion of the lesson, students will beable to: Demonstrate the importance ofrecording theirpersonal history in ajournal. Time: Two 45-50 minute classes. Note: Complete this lesson at the beginning of yourstudy of the Chinese inMontana and utilize thejournal throughout theweek.

Ask students to select a piece of construction paper for the cover of theirjournal. Give them many different colorsto choose from. Have them fold the pieceof paper in half, lengthwise. 2. Have students decorate their cover with scraps of construction paper and glue,markers, crayons, etc. 3. Pass out 8 sheets of 8.5 x 11 inch white paper per student. 4. Tell students they will be making two \"signatures\" for their journal. Ask them tofold the sheets in half lengthwise so theywill fit inside their construction papercover. Have them put the signatures insidethe cover. 5. Next, tell students they will be making their binding. Have everyone punch three holesin the fold of their journal. After doingthis, tell students to secure their bindingwith yarn. 6. Their journal is complete and ready to be filled! *Note: For young students, pass out already constructed journals, ready for the cover to bedecorated and journaling to begin.

Time Two 45-50 minute class periods. Materials Footlocker Materials: From the Far East to the Old West video & StudyGuide User Guide Materials: Map ofChinese provinces T e a cher Provided Materials: worldand U.S. mapsPre-Lesson Preparation Most of the Chinese who came to America were from a province called Kwangtung, located in the southern part of China. It tookover a month via ship to travel the distance - a trip that cost $50 tomake. Many Chinese came to Montana and the West in search ofgold. They were headed to a place called \"Gum San\" (GoldMountain) where they were told they would find gold nuggets the sizeof oranges. Although there was a strong push to find gold in theAmericas, another reason for making the long trip was the chaos oflate 19th century China. During the Taiping Rebellion, led by HongXiuquan - a Chinese man who thought he was the older brother ofJesus Christ - more than 20 million people died. (To put thisnumber into perspective, only 1 million people died during the CivilWar in America). Drought and further fighting also helped thousands of Chinese men make their decision to come to America. Theywanted to make their fortune in America and help their families bysending money back home. The 1870 Montana census records approximately 2,400 Chinese living in Montana. In the city of Butte, there were 98 Chinese minersin 1870. Chinese men came to the United States, and especiallyMontana, in search of gold during the Gold Rush. After the rushended, many stayed on as railroad workers or opened their ownlaundry or shops that provided Chinese food, herbs, newspapers, andcompanionship for other Chinese in America to visit and chat abouttheir homeland.

MONTANA HISTORICAL SOCIETY\u2014 34 \u2014East Meets West: The Chinese Experience in Montana Lesson 2: A Long Way to Travel (continued) Chinese men far outnumbered women in the 19th and early 20th centuries. Some of theearly Chinese women in Montana were eitherprostitutes, sold by their families in China, orwives of wealthy businessmen, who had themoney to pay their traveling expenses. FewChinese men married outside their race - itwas illegal to do so after 1909, according toMontana law. Procedure for Class One 1. Put up the world map in the front of your classroom. 2. Have two students come to the front of the room. Ask them to find KwangtungProvince in China, where the majority ofChinese men came to Montana from inthe mid to late 1800s. Then askstudents to find San Francisco,California on the map. 3. Now ask two other students to come to the front of the class. Ask them to findHelena, Montana. 4. Ask students why they think these Chinese men traveled so far to a foreigncountry. Have them make a list. Thenask them to list what would make themgo on such a long journey. How arethese lists similar and different? Havethem share with the class. Procedure for Class Two 1. Watch the Chinese portion of the video From the Far East to the Old West , which is approximately 20 minutes long.Use the questions from the From the Far East to the Old West study packet to stimulate class discussion. Note:some of the activities are to be doneprior to watching the video. Discussion Questions 1. How did the Chinese men come to San Francisco (via land or water?) Was it ashort or long trip in the 1800s? Howlong did it take? Was it a safe trip?Why or why not? 2. How did the Chinese men travel from San Francisco to Helena? Was it ashort or long trip in the 1800s? Howlong did it take? Was it a safe trip?Why or why not?3. Ask students what they would do if they were living in China during the mid tolate 1800s. Would they travel to theU.S. in search of fortune? Why or whynot? 4. Has anyone in the room ever been to China? A foreign country? Out ofMontana? How long did it take to getthere? Did they think it took a longtime? How was their trip similar anddifferent to the trip men from Chinamade? How was it different? Further Exploration Ask students to come prepared to discuss family trees and ancestors.Have each student, with the help oftheir parents, write down where theirgrandparents, parents, and eventhemselves were born. Have eachstudent give a report on where they andtheir family are from. Have studentspoint out each country and town on aworld and U.S. map.

Doolittle, Corvallis Middle School, April 2000 Pre-Lesson Preparation Just like other immigrants, young Chinese workers (mainly men), made the long journey to Montana in search of their fortune -gold. During the Gold Rush, thousands of men came to theUnited States and settled in states that were rich in gold. Butafter the Gold Rush, many Chinese stayed on because they foundor created lucrative jobs or could not afford to return back toChina. The railroad was a major employer of Chinese workers,but many opened their own businesses, such as laundries,restaurants, and mercantiles. Some, such as physicians, came toMontana to open their own practice. The Chinese community,as well as Americans in search of different goods, friendlyservice, or different medical care, frequented many Chinesebusinesses. Procedure: 1. Divide students into three groups. Provide each group with one of three different sections of Robert Swartout, Jr.'sarticle \"Kwangtung to Big Sky: The Chinese in Montana,1864-1900\" (section 1 begins on page 45; section 2 on47; section 3 on 48).

Each meal usuallyconsists of a large portion of fan and cai, which consists ofvegetables, and a little protein - generally fish or tofu. \"With very little available arable land, the agricultural emphasis in most of China has alwaysbeen toward more efficient food crops rather thanlivestock. Rice, soybeans, tofu, wheat, gluten, andother grains and legumes have been developed asprotein sources for millennia.

MONTANA HISTORICAL SOCIETY (continued)\u2014 42 \u2014East Meets West: The Chinese Experience in Montana Lesson 6: Chinese Food (continued) Many Americans and immigrants to Montana made fun of Chinese eating habits. Manydidn't believe that fish was a \"real food\" andthought the Chinese were weak because theydidn't eat livestock or game meat. Becauseof essential Omega oils, fish is very healthy,as is the well-balanced diet that most Chineseimmigrants ate. Procedure: 1. Discuss the importance of grain in China and to Chinese Montanans.Utilizing the world map, show wheredifferent types of grain are grown inChina. 2. Pass out the chopsticks to everyone in your class. Show students how to usechopsticks by utilizing the chopsticksguide. 3. Have students practice using the chopsticks without actually pickinganything up. If you have provided thechopsticks be sure to tell them thatyou'll be using them to eat with, so theyshould try to keep them off the floorand not pick up anything dirty withthem. Do not use the chopsticks fromthe footlocker to eat with! 4. Bring in enough sticky rice for your class (made the night before). Bring inother \"sticky\" foods like gummy bears,marshmallows, gum drops, etc. Passout each type of food and have studentstry their hand at using the chopsticks.Have students keep track of which foodswere easiest and hardest to eat andhave a class discussion. 5. Next, pass around the mushrooms. Ask them to complete the \"How to Look atan Artifact\" sheet located in the User'sGuide. 6. View the photo of Dr. Huie Pock's office & store. Do students recognize any ofthe objects in the photo that we useevery day? Any items that are notfamiliar? What could they be used for? 7. Have students record their answers to the Discussion Questions and anyFurther Exploration in their journal.Discussion Questions 1. Which food was easiest to eat? What food was hardest? 2. What foods would be very hard to eat with chopsticks? (jello, pudding, etc.) 3. How are chopsticks and our eating utensils (knife, fork, and spoon) similarand different? Further Exploration Purchase inexpensive chopsticks for each student in your class. Ask them touse chopsticks for one whole day, tryingto eat everything that day with them.Have them keep track of which foodswere easiest and hardest to eat withthem. Go on a field trip! Visit a Chinese restaurant and try a wide array ofChinese food. Have students keep trackof their favorites and have a discussionof the various types of food you try. Ifyou can't go to the restaurant, do takeout! Talk about the similarities and differences of Chinese and Americanfoods. Have students get on theInternet to research traditional Chinesefoods. Then have students make a listof traditional American foods. How arethese foods similar and different? Have a Chinese Food Festival! Ask each student, with the help of theirparents, to create a dish from China.Invite parents to the festival. Havestudents give their reports (from Lesson1) and then have a party sharing all ofthe wonderful and different foods.

The habit of tea drinking spreadto Japan in the 6th century, but it was notintroduced to Europe and America till the17th and 18th centuries. Now the number oftea drinkers in the world is legion and is stillon the increase. The Categories of Tea Chinese tea may be classified into five categories according to the different methodsby which it is processed. 1)Green tea: Green tea is the variety that keeps the original color of the tea leaveswithout fermentation during processing.This category consists mainly ofLongjing tea of Zhejiang Province,Maofeng of Huangshan Mountain inAnhui Province and Biluochun produced in Jiangsu. 2)Black tea: Black tea, known as \"red tea\" (hong cha) in China, is the categorywhich is fermented before baking; it is alater variety developed on the basis ofthe green tea. The best brands of blacktea are Qihong of Anhui, Dianhong ofYunnan, Suhong of Jiangsu, Chuanhong of Sichuan and Huhong of Hunan. 3)Wulong tea: This represents a variety half way between the green and theblack teas, being made after partialfermentation. It is a specialty from theprovinces on China's southeast coast:Fujian, Guangdong and Taiwan. 4)Compressed tea: This is the kind of tea that is compressed and hardenedinto a certain shape. It is good fortransport and storage and is mainlysupplied to the ethnic minorities living inthe border areas of the country. Ascompressed tea is black in color in itscommercial form, so it is also known inChina as \"black tea\". Most of thecompressed tea is in the form of bricks;it is, therefore, generally called \"bricktea\", though it is sometimes also in theform of cakes and bowls. It is mainlyproduced in Hubei, Hunan, Sichuan andYunnan provinces. 5)Scented tea: This kind of tea is made by mixing fragrant flowers in the tealeaves in the course of processing. Theflowers commonly used for this purposeare jasmine and magnolia amongothers. Jasmine tea is a well-knownfavorite with the northerners of Chinaand with a growing number offoreigners. China, the Homeland of Tea \u2014 46 \u2014Tea Production A new tea-plant must grow for five years before its leaves can be picked and, at 30years of age, it will be too old to beproductive. The trunk of the old plant mustthen be cut off to force new stems to growout of the roots in the coming year. Byrepeated rehabilitation in this way, a plantmay serve for about l00 years. For the fertilization of tea gardens, soybean cakes or other varieties of organic manureare generally used, and seldom chemicalfertilizers. When pests are discovered, theaffected plants will be removed to preventtheir spread, and also to avoid the use ofpesticides. The season of tea-picking depends on local climate and varies from area to area. On theshores of West Lake in Hangzhou, where thefamous green tea Longjing (Dragon Well)comes from, picking starts from the end ofMarch and lasts through October, altogether20-30 times from the same plants at intervalsof seven to ten days. With a longer interval,the quality of the tea will deteriorate. A skilled woman picker can only gather 600 grams (a little over a pound) of green tealeaves in a day. The new leaves must be parched in tea cauldrons. This work, which used to be donemanually, has been largely mechanized. Top-grade Dragon Well tea, however, still has tobe stir-parched by hand, doing only 250grams every half hour. The tea-cauldrons areheated electrically to a temperature of about25\u00b0C or 74\u00b0F. It takes four pounds of freshleaves to produce one pound of parched tea. The best Dragon Well tea is gathered several days before Qingming (Pure Brightness, 5thsolar term) when new twigs have just begunto grow and carry \"one leaf and a bud.\" Tomake one kilogram (2.2 lbs) of finished tea,60,000 tender leaves have to be plucked. Inthe old days Dragon Well tea of this grade was meant solely for the imperial household;it was, therefore, known as \"tribute tea\". For the processes of grinding, parching, rolling, shaping and drying other grades oftea various machines have been developedand built, turning out about 100 kilograms offinished tea an hour and relieving the workersfrom much of their drudgery. China's Tea-Producing Areas Tea is produced in vast areas of China from Hainan lsland down in the extreme south toShandong Province in the north, from Tibetin the southwest to Taiwan across the Straits,totaling more than 20 provinces. These maybe divided into four major areas: 1)The Jiangnan area: It lies south of the middle and lower reaches of theChangjiang (Yangtze) River, and is themost prolific of China's tea-growingareas. Most of its output is the greenvariety; some black tea is also produced. 2)The Jiangbei area: This refers to a large area north of the same river,where the average temperature is 2-3Centigrade degrees lower than in theJiangnan area. Green tea is theprincipal variety turned out there, butShaanxi and Gansu provinces, which arealso parts of this area, producecompressed tea for supply to theminority areas in the Northwest. 3)The Southwest area: This embraces Sichuan, Yunnan, Guizhou and Tibet,producing black, green as well ascompressed teas. Pu'er tea of YunnanProvince enjoys a good sale in Chinaand abroad. 4)The Lingnan area: This area, consisting of the southern provinces ofGuangdong, Guangxi, Fujian andtaiwan, produces Wulong tea, which isrenowned both at home and abroad. East Meets West: The Chinese Experience in Montana Lesson 7: China, the Homeland of Tea (continued)\u2014 47 \u2014Advantages of Tea-Drinking Tea has been one of the daily necessities in China since time immemorial. Countless numbers of people like to havetheir after-meal cup of tea. In summer or warm climate, tea seems to dispel the heat and bring on instant cooltogether with a feeling of relaxation. Forthis reason, tea-houses abound in townsand market villages in South China andprovide elderly retirees with the locales tomeet and chat over a cup of tea. Medically, the tea leaf contains a number of chemicals, of which 20-30% is tannicacid, known for its anti-inflammatory andgermicidal properties. It also contains analkaloid (5%, mainly caffeine), a stimulantfor the nerve center and the process ofmetabolism. Tea with the aromatics in itmay help resolve meat and fat, and thuspromote digestion. It is, therefore, ofspecial importance to people who livemainly on meat, like many of the ethnicminorities in China. A popular proverbamong them says, \"Rather go without saltfor three days than without tea for asingle day.\" Tea is also rich in various v itamins an d, for smoke rs, it helps to discharge nicotine out of the system. The above, ho wever, does not go to say that th e stronger the tea, the more advantages it will yield. T oo much tannic acid will affect the secr etion of the gastric juice irritate the membrane of the stomach and cause indigestion o r constipation. Strong tea taken just before bedtime will give rise to occasional insomnia. Constant drinking of over- strong tea m ay induce heart and b lood- pressure disorders in some people, reduc e the milk of a breast-feeding mo ther, and put a brown color on the teeth o f young people. But it is not difficult to ward off these undesirable effects: just don't make your tea too strong. East Meets West: The Chinese Experience in Montana Lesson 7: China, the Homeland of Tea (continued)\u2014 48 \u2014East WestEast Meets West: The Chinese Experience in Montana Chinese Tea Ceremony The art of drinking and serving tea plays a major cultural role in China. It inspires poetryand songs. Mutual love of tea cementslifelong friendships. For centuries, the ritualof preparing and serving tea has held aspecial place in the hearts and minds ofChinese aristocracy, court officials,intellectuals and poets. The Chinese tea ceremony emphasizes the tea, rather than the ceremony -- what the teatastes like, smells like, and how one teatastes compared to the previous tea, or insuccessive rounds of drinking. Ceremonydoesn't mean that each server will performthe ritual the same way; it is not related toreligion. Each step is meant to be a sensoryexploration and appreciation. Most teas used in the Chinese tea ceremony are grown in the mountains of Taiwan ataround 4,000 feet. These teas areparticularly refined, such as oolong teas thatare lightly fermented and red teas that can bemoderately to heavily fermented. This style of tea-drinking uses small cups to match the small, unglazed clay teapots; eachcup is just large enough to hold about twosmall swallows of tea. These tiny cups areparticularly popular in Fujian and Chiujao, insouthern coastal China above Canton. InShanghai and Beijing they use large cups. To Brew Tea Chinese-style After heating water to boiling, the teapot first is rinsed with hot water. Usingchopsticks or a bamboo tea scoop, fill teapotapproximately 1/3full with tea leaves and then pour boiling water into the pot. Hold theteapot over a large bowl, letting the overflowrun into the bowl. Give the tea leaves a rinseby filling the pot half full with hot water, thendraining the water out immediately, leavingonly the soaked tea leaves. Now fill the pot tothe top with more hot water, cover and pouradditional water over the teapot resting in the tea bowl. Do not allow bubbles to form in thepot. When mixed with the tea, bubbles forma foam that is not aesthetically pleasing. Besure to not let the tea steep too long; the firstinfusion should be steeped for only 30seconds. In less than a minute, pour the teainto the cups by moving the teapot around ina continual motion over the cups so that theyare filled together. Each cup should tasteexactly the same. After steeping, the tea can be poured into a second teapot or tea pitcher to be served atleisure. More water can be added to theteapot, and up to five infusions typically canbe made from the same tea leaves. Be sure toadd 10 more seconds for the second brewingand 15 additional seconds thereafter. Each pot of tea serves three to four rounds and up to five or six, depending on the teaand the server. The goal is that each roundtaste the same as the first. Creatingconsistent flavor is where the mastery of theserver is seen. Importance of Water The water used in the tea ceremony is as important as the tea itself. Chlorine andfluoride in tap water should be filtered out asthey harm the flavor of the tea. Distilledwater makes flat tea and should be avoided.High mineral content in the water brings outthe richness and sweetness of green tea.Black teas taste better when made with watercontaining less Volvic. Ideal tea water shouldhave an alkaline pH around 7.9. Green teasare ruined by boiling water; the temperatureis best around 170-185 degrees F.

Objectives At the conclusion of the lesson students will beable to: make an abacus and be able todemonstrate simplenumbers, additionand subtraction. Time One 45-50 minute Materials: Abacus User Guide Materials:instructions formaking Abacus,worksheets punch, staplers.Pre-Lesson Preparation People have counted, added and subtracted with an abacus since ancient times. The name comes from the Greek wordabax, meaning \"board\" or \"calculating table.\" While there is no actual record of who invented the abacus, it is depicted in asketchbook written during the Yuan Dynasty (14th Century). Webster's dictionary defines abacus as a \"frame with beads or balls sliding back and forth on wires on in slots, for doing orteaching arithmetic.\" Arithmetic includes addition, subtraction,multiplication and division. The abacus can also be used towork with fractions and with finding square and cube roots. The advantage of its use over pencil or pen arithmetic is time. It is faster than writing down the problem and solving it. Whenworking with the abacus one just needs to be accurate. Youleave the memory work to the abacus frame. The onedisadvantage is that inexperienced users make mistakes. Butthat can happen in pencil arithmetic too. The Chinese abacus has a center bar with rows of two beads above and rows of five beads below. All numbers are calculatedfrom the center bar (which divides the two and five beads), andfrom right to left; and the answer is read left to right astraditionally taught in American schools. The beads are used tohelp keep track of the numbers beings used. Each vertical row of beads represents a different multiple of 10 (1000, 100, 10, and 1). The white beads in every row belowthe center bar each stand for five of the unit. The beads mustbe pushed against the center bar to be counted. To make numbers, bring the beads from the ends of the rows to the centerline. To add numbers, push the number of beadsneeded to the centerline. To subtract numbers, push thenumber of beads away from the centerline. Procedure 1. Give background information and show the actual abacus to the students. 2. Let students make an abacus. This will take from 5 to 15 minutes, depending on whether students assemble fromscratch. (continued)\u2014 50 \u20143. Once assembled, the student can practice with the abacus to make numbers. Youmay want students to break into smallgroups and work together. 4. Have students record their answers to the Discussion Questions and worksheets intheir journal.Discussion Questions: 1. Ask students what it's like to use an abacus. Has anyone in the class everused an abacus before? 2. How hard/easy do students think using an abacus is?East Meets West: The Chinese Experience in Montana Lesson 8: A new Way to Count (continued) Directions for making an Abacus 1. Enlarge and copy the abacus pattern onto oaktag or light cardboard. 2. Pinch together and fold, matching arrows as indicated. 3. Staple as indicated to secure fold. 4. Punch holes as indicated. 5. Cut pieces of string for each student. You may need to start each board with the string tied to the first hole. 6. Run string through bottom hole, thread with five white beads (or macaroni);run string through center hole andthread with two colored beads; runstring through top hole. 7.

Objectives At the conclusion of the lesson students will beable to: discuss the custom of Chinese footbinding; demonstrate awareness that fewChinese women inAmerican had boundfeet, although in theearly days wives ofmerchants usuallydid; compare foot binding withrestrictive clothing inuse today and in thepast. Time One 45-50 class period. Materials Footlocker Materials: lotus slippers,picture of bound feetin Splendid Slippers book User Guide Materials: \"ThoseDoll-Sized Feet\" T e a cher Provided Materials: nonePre-Lesson Preparation In the tenth century in China, a prince began the practice of foot binding because he loved the small 'lily feet' of hisconcubine. Thus traditional Chinese values for over 1000 yearsdictated that the feet of young girls should be bound to keepthem small. 'Lily feet', as they were called, were thought to bevery dainty and beautiful and a symbol of gentility and high-class. Although the term sounded harmless, it was really verycruel. It began when a girl was between three and eleven yearsold. First her foot was washed in hot water and massaged.Then the child's toes were turned under and pressed against thebottom of her foot. The arches were broken as the foot waspulled straight with the leg, and a long narrow cotton bandagewould be tightly wound around the foot from the toes to theankle to hold the toes in place. After two or three years, a girl's feet actually shrank -- until they could fit into shoes just three inches long. This resulted in feetthat were very deformed and unbearably painful to walk on.Sometimes the toes even fell off, because blood could no longerreach them. Besides identifying women of high-class, itprevented women from \"wandering,\" since a woman with boundfeet was unable to walk unassisted, and even going a shortdistance was very painful. These women had to walk with veryshort mincing steps and could stand only with great difficulty. Tiny 3-inch-long shoes, called 'lotus shoes', were made of silk and were beautifully embroidered. In the upper classes inChina, a good marriage would be impossible to arrange if thegirl had \"big ugly feet.\" The practice of foot binding continuedin China for over 1000 years until the Manchu Dynasty wastoppled in 1911 and the new republic was formed. Footbinding was then outlawed. Few Chinese women and girls who came to the United States had their feet bound as small children in China, but those whodid had to spend their lives with the tiny useless feet. Womenfrom the peasant and working classes did not have their feetbound as children because it was necessary for them to be ableto work in the home and fields. As these were more frequentlythe women who came to America, most of the immigrantwomen did not have bound feet. (Chinese Historical andCultural Project, 1994).\u2014 56 \u2014Procedure: 1. Read the introduction to this lesson to your class. 2. Ask one student to read \"Those Doll-Sized Feet\" out loud to the class. 3. Discuss why this was done. (Students must understand that this practice was discontinued about 80 years ago). 4. Show the picture of the bound feet and ask students how big they think women's feet were. 5. Show the lotus slippers to the class. 6. Have students record their answers to the Discussion Questions and Further Exploration topics in their journal. Discussion Questions 1. What do students think of the now-discontinued practice of foot binding? What things could Chinese girls and womenno longer do if their feet were bound? 2. Why do students think that Chinese men and women participated in the practice of foot binding? Further Exploration Discuss the various types of restrictive clothing in our culture today, such as panty hose, platform or high-heeledshoes, neckties, tight clothing, etc. How are these itemssimilar to and different from lily feet? Discuss restrictive clothing from the past and why it were used (primarily to make attractive). Hoop skirts, girdles,corsets, big hats, wigs, etc. Why are these types of clothingno longer in use? How do we as Americans make ourselves attractive? Discuss hair, makeup, body piercing, tattoos, etc. Howhave these things changed over the years?

By Jane Kam Pang AhPo's house was next door to mine for the first decade of my life. For as long as I canremember, my mother and I spent a part ofeach day visiting her. AhPo had seven children. My mother was the eldest. She sewed, she cleaned, she cooked,and she had those \"doll-sized\" feet. She wasalways clad in dark traditional Chinesepajamas, unless she 'went out'; then it was along, dark cheongsam. Her long hair waspulled back to form a pug. Her skin, like mymother's, was almost flawless. And shealways wore those small, small black leathershoes. Some were laced; others hand anarrow strap across the step. Wooden stools were strategically placed around her kitchen so AhPo could kneel fromice-box to sink to table to stove, and not haveto walk on those tiny feet of hers. Her kneeswere usually swollen or blistered. In the lateafternoon. AhPo would hobble out to theback yard, carrying a big, big black pot tocook the evening's rice. She tended the fire,fueled with wood, while sitting on a smallbench. I can still see that black, black potthat contained the whitest, hottest rice. It was years later, when I saw her bare feet that I started to understand the effort and thepain that must have accompanied her everystep. Her feet were smaller than my hands.The big toe was where it should be, but theother four toes were folded under the sole ofthe foot. The big toe and the heel of the footwere pushed very close together. The arch ofthe foot was very high. When very young, about age six, girls like my grandmother had their feet bound. Long,narrow strips of cloth were wrapped in afigure eight over the instep, around the heel,under the foot. These bandages were tightened daily until the foot measured lessthan four inches. Historically, some believe this practice started around the Sahng Dynasty. This extremelypainful custom lasted over a thousand years.Mothers wished their daughters to be in a'state of refinement and grace'. The swayingwalk that necessarily developed was thoughtto be erotic and sensuous. Foot binding wasbeyond fashion. Words like feminine, sexy,dignified, fragile, delicate, gentle must beused to depict the qualities women hoped forwith bound feet. Although AhPo lived over 80 years, I do not remember her as being old or handicapped.She had a regal look and did all herhousehold chores without the aid ofcomputerized appliances. She was truly alady by all standards -- yes, with those \"doll-sized feet.\" \u2014 58 \u2014East WestEast Meets West: The Chinese Experience in Montana Crossword Puzzle ACROSS 4. an old Chinese custom ofwrapping a girl'sfeet so that theywould not grow. 6. an official count of thepopulation withdetails as to age,sex, occupation,age, and race. 7. confined or kept within limits. 10. the dried, condensed juiceof a poppyflower, that hasa narcotic effect,that was used asmedicine. 13. a women who is a secondary wifeto a marriedChinese man. 14. walking or moving withshort, affectedlydainty steps. 17. a group of people 18. \"of gentle birth\" and Getting minerals or metals suchas gold fromplacers through washing.
