It is based on a philosophy created in 1924 by Austrian scientist Rudolf Steiner, who was also the founder of the Waldorf school system. Steiner developed the \"spiritual science\" of anthroposophy, which was meant to understand science through the spiritual world. Because the soil is treated like a living organism, it is necessary to build its \"immune system\" and maintain its health. Since pesticides and herbicides tend to de - plete the soil of nutri - ents, biodynamic meth - ods ban the use of both. Instead, homeopathic remedies usually pro - duced from plants and minerals are utilized to nurture and protect the vines from pest and dis - ease. In short, the goal of biodynamic farming is to be in tune with the total - ity of life forces affecting the growth of the plant, so that the vineyard can find a natural harmony. Two main factors make biodynamic farm - ing distinctly different from organic farming. The first is the use of a complex system of herbal sprays and composting techniques, known as \"preparations.\" The second is the timing of the operations in the vineyard and cellar, strictly regulated by the movements of the spheres. Biodynamic producers follow lunar and cosmic patterns to determine when to prune, rack, bottle, and perform other operations that impact the final product.Certain organizations, such as Demeter and Biodyvin, provide offi - cial certification to biodynamic farmers who adhere to a strict set of rules. Other growers choose to borrow various elements from biodynamics, ap - plying only the principles they deem most suitable to their vineyards on a case-by-case basis. What is the purpose of biodynamic farming? Sustainability, cer - tainly, but its merits go far beyond this. Proponents of biodynamics insist that it benefits the planet and creates a healthier work environ- ment, but they are also convinced by the results\u2014what's in the glass. What do bio - dynamic wines taste like? It's hard to say. Successful examples seem to exhibit a liveli - ness and energy not evident in wines result - ing from conventional farming. One theory suggests that living soils naturally retain more freshness than those devoid of life; should the vine reach a natural balance in an ecosystem rich with animal, plant, and microbial life, then it should also produce grapes with a perfect bal - ance at ripeness. Skeptics, however, dismiss biodynamics as a hippie marketing fad, with no palpable outcome on the wine. Luckily, we can taste for ourselves: the six wines featured this month are all hand crafted by enthusiastic pro - ponents of biodynamic agriculture, and the results speak for themselves.

Breton $26 is it possible to squeeze honey from a stone? That is hard to imag - ine, yet the image is precisely what this young Vouvray from Catherine Breton brings to mind. The honeyed aspect is typical of Chenin Blanc, and when coupled with the stony el - ement derived from the chalky soils found in this part of the Loire Valley, it yields this live wire of a wine with succulent fruit and a completely bone-dry, mouthwatering finale. A truly versa - tile white, La Dilettante has the bright acidity to pair with sushi or delicate fish dishes, but it contains the textured weight on the palate to accompany richer foods like poultry or mushrooms. For a real treat, age it for five years and enjoy it with a slice of seared foie gras. 2015 Pinot Gris Grand Cru \" eiChBerG\" Kuentz-Bas $51 i predict this Eichberg will give you one of the most beautiful Pinot Gris aromas you've ever experienced. Gorgeous! Definitive! Then, a luxurious, satin pillow on the palate. \"Samuel, what would you serve with it?\"\"Risdeveau with morels. Pigeon Saumur Champigny are models of purity, finesse, and drinkability. This blend of parcels from the communes of Chac\u00e9 and Varrains is only made in the best vintages, and sees the longest ag - ing of Germain's reds\u2014up to 24 months in a mix of older barrels and foudres . Thierry is a pioneer of biodynamics in the Loire Val - ley, with great experience and wisdom acquired under the tutelage of Clos Rougeard's Charly Foucault. With incredibly pristine, vivid fruit along with a deep, rich struc ture and silky-fine tannins, Germain's reds are grand examples of the heights biodynamic wines can achieve. 2016 Pi C saint Lou P rouGe \"Cu V\u00e9e sainte aGn\u00e8s\" ermita Ge Du PiC saint Lou P $26 biodynamic agriculture may seem like voodoo medicine to some, but few are more convinced of its worth than the three Ravaille brothers, who farm the limestone slopes around Pic Saint Loup in the Languedoc. Since beginning the conversion to biodynamics in 1999, the Ravailles have been quick to sing the praises of this philosophy\u2014homeopathic remedies for vines, if you will. According to cellar master Pierre Ravaille, biodynamics brought noticeable im - provements to vineyard health and overall quality within years. Here is a red to support that claim, a blend of mainly Syrah and Grenache from high altitude on poor, thin, rocky soil. Its mystical perfume evokes wild blackberries, smoke, spice, and olive brine in a chewy, mineral-driven expression of this underrated southern French terroir . Drinkable now, it is also a great bargain cellar candi - date, and an excellent ambassador for biodynamic viticulture.2016 Corse Fi Gari rouGe CLos Canare LLi $48 in recent decades, Corsica's wine scene has experienced a total revolu - tion. In spite of its ancient history of viticulture, the island's production had long been plagued by an overemphasis on quantity, with the vast majority of the volume represented by bulk wine sent to mainland France for blending. Fortunately, a resurgence in enthusiasm for traditional methods, along with technological advances in winemaking, have allowed for a return to the quality- oriented wines that Corsica had been praised for years ago. At the forefront of this upheaval are producers such as Yves Canarelli. Ever since joining the fam - ily domaine in 1993, Yves has focused on replanting native varieties and working the vineyards biodynamically to bring out the best of his terroir in the Figari ap - pellation, located on the southern tip of the island. Clos Canarelli's Corse Figari rouge , composed primarily of Niellucciu filled out by Syrah and Sciaccarellu, has the depth and intensity that you would expect from this wind-swept, sun- baked land, as well as a certain finesse that complements its rugged edge. It rep - resents one of a growing number of captivating wines from this exciting region. 2014 irouL\u00e9Guy rouGe \"Cu V\u00e9e haitza\" Domaine arretxea $46 michel and th\u00e9r\u00e8se riouspeyrous craft some of the most exciting, singular wines in France\u2014wines that tell a story about a land and a people. Basque country, in the heart of the Pyrenees just miles from the Spanish border, feels drastically removed from the rest of France, thanks to its unique culture and landscape. Haitza, Arretxea's top bot - tling of red from the steep mountain slopes of Iroul\u00e9guy, features Tannat and some Cabernet Sauvignon, aged in barrel and built to last. Pitch-black in color with dense, earthy tannins and suggestions of wild forest berries and spice, this bottling is the Pyrenees' answer to Clape's Cornas and Tempier's Cabassaou.
