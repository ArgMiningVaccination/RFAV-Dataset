Read Full LicensePage 2/22Abstract Objective The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has brought severe damage to global health and socioeconomics. In China, traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) is the most important complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) and it has shown a bene\u0000cial role in the prevention and treatment of COVID- 19. However, it is unknown whether patients are willing to accept TCM treatment. The objective of our study is to investigate the acceptance, attitude, and independent predictors of TCM among asymptomatic COVID-19 patients admitted to Shanghai fangcang hospital during the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic in Shanghai in 2022. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted on asymptomatic COVID-19 patients in the largest fangcang hospital in Shanghai, China, from April 22, 2022, to May 25, 2022. Based on the literature review of previous similar studies, a self-report questionnaire was developed to assess the patients' attitude and acceptance of TCM, and a multivariate logistic regression analysis was conducted to determine the independent predictors of TCM acceptance. Results A total of 1,121 patients completed the survey, of whom 91.53% were willing to accept CAM treatment whereas 8.65% of participants showed no willingness. Among those who were positive to receive CAM treatment, 70.51% of the participants were willing to be treated with Chinese herbal medicine, 62.79% with Chinese patent medicine, 34.96% with massage therapy, 33.20% with moxibustion treatment, and 29.00% with cupping therapy. There were signi\u0000cant differences in the 10 variables such as monthly income level, SARS-CoV-2 vaccination, and patients' cognition and attitude towards TCM among the patients who were willing or unwilling to accept TCM treatment. Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that the patients who have received two doses of COVID-19 vaccine (OR=2.069, 95%CI: 1.029-4.162, P=0.041 vs not (OR=2.293, 95%CI: 1.029-4.162, P=0.014 vs not understood), thought to exert e\u0000cacy (OR=1.607, 95%CI: 0.849-3.034, P= 0.145 vs not TCM is safe (OR=2.856, 95%CI: 1.334-6.112, P=0.007 vs not thought), TCM is effective (OR=2.724, 95%CI: 1.249-5.940, P=0.012 vs not thought), and those who informed their attending physician if using TCM for treatment (OR=3.455, 95%CI:1.867-6.392, P<0.001 vs not informed) were more likely to accept TCM treatment. However, patients who thought TCM might delay your treatment (OR=0.256, 95%CI: 0.142-0.462, P<0.001 not thought) was an independent predictor for unwillingness to accept TCM treatment.Page 3/22Conclusion This is the \u0000rst study to investigate the acceptance, attitude, and predictors of intention to receive TCM among asymptomatic COVID-19 patients. The next step of this study will be a long-term follow-up of these patients to observe whether accepting TCM treatment will in\u0000uence their quality of life. 1 Background At present, the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is still spreading all over the world, which has brought a heavy burden to the global economic recovery and made the fragile healthcare system of some developing countries fall into a state of being on the verge of collapse. With the emergence of new variant strains, the situation has become more severe due to their high severity and rapid transmissibility. The daily number of con\u0000rmed cases presents a rising trajectory across the globe. As of September 07, 2022, the total number of con\u0000rmed cases had reached over 524 million with more than 6.28 million deaths worldwide [1]. Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) is de\u0000ned as a set of different medical and healthcare systems, practices, and products, which are generally not considered part of traditional medicine [2]. One survey carried out in Iran between April 20, 2020, and August 20, 2020, demonstrated that at least one type of CAM was used by 84% of the participants during the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. In the majority of participants, CAM was adopted to prevent the infection of COVID-19 or reduce the anxiety caused by the COVID-19 pandemic [3]. An anonymous electronic survey was conducted in Ghana showed that 82.5% of the participants applied CAM during COVID-19 [4]. A meta-analysis showed that different CAM interventions such as acupuncture, traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), relaxation, and Gongfa signi\u0000cantly alleviated the psychological symptoms (depression, anxiety, stress, sleep quality, negative emotions, quality of life) and physical symptoms (in\u0000ammatory factors, physical activity, chest pain, and respiratory function) in COVID-19 patients [5]. As an important part of CAM in China, TCM has its characteristics in the prevention and treatment of acute infectious diseases [6, 7], which is one of the major therapies recommended in the guideline for prevention, control, diagnosis, and treatment of COVID-19 published by the National Health Commission of China [8]. A clinical study conducted at Wuhan fangcang hospitals found that early treatment with Huashibaidu granule for seven days alleviated the deterioration of symptoms in covid-19 patients with moderate and mild symptoms [9]. Another study also showed that Lianhua Qingwen capsules could signi\u0000cantly shorten the median time of recovery and improve the improvement rate of chest CT imaging as well as the clinical cure rate. Moreover, the role of TCM in the prevention and control of COVID-19 has been recognized by the World Health Organization [10]. In the last week of February 2022, the Omicron BA 2.2 variant of COVID-19 caused a wave of infection in Shanghai, China [11]. To apply TCM to more asymptomatic COVID-19 patients, it is particularly important to understand their hesitation to take TCM. Up to now, no research data has been published regarding thePage 4/22willingness of asymptomatic COVID-19 patients to accept TCM. Thus, we conducted an online cross- sectional study to record the acceptance and attitude towards TCM by asymptomatic COVID-19 patients and analyzed the factors in\u0000uencing the patients' acceptance of treatment with TCM. 2 Methods And Materials 2.1 Study design and participants An online questionnaire survey was conducted among adult asymptomatic COVID-19 patients who were admitted to the largest fangcang hospital (Si Ye Cao Fangcang hospital) in Shanghai, China, from April 22, 2022, to May 25, 2022. This study employed the \"Wenjuanxing\" platform to distribute and retrieve electronic questionnaires, and export relevant data information. Patients with intellectual and cognitive impairment were excluded from the survey. 2.2 Ethical approval The study was performed in compliance with the Declaration of Helsinki, and approved by the Ethics Committee of Changhai Hospital, Naval Medical University, China (CHEC2022-056). All methods were carried out in accordance with relevant guidelines and regulations in the declaration- Ethics approval and consent to participate section. Oral informed consent was obtained and all of the participants were briefed about the purpose of the study, research procedures, privacy of their identity and any other personal information, and their other relevant rights. 2.3 Questionnaires A self-administered questionnaire was constructed in the English language to evaluate the acceptance and attitude towards TCM. The questionnaire was developed based on the literature review of similar studies and was translated into the Chinese language before distribution to the patients [3,4,12-22]. The questionnaire mainly included four parts: (1) Basic information of participants included demographic characteristics (gender, age, body mass index, education level, average monthly income, residence, employment, current smoking status, and current drinking status) and clinical characteristics (comorbidities, vaccination status, and knowledge about culture of TCM). (2) Participants' attitude toward TCM was determined through the following questions: do you think the treatment of TCM is safe, do you think the treatment of TCM is effective, will you inform your attending physician if you accept TCM for treatment, and do you think TCM might delay your treatment. (3) Participants' willingness to take TCM; \u0000rst, participants were asked to respond to whether they are willing to accept TCM, and if the answer was \"Yes\", they were further asked about the types of TCM they were willing to accept and the reasons for their willingness to accept TCM. If the patients were not willing to accept TCM, they were asked the reasons for their unwillingness to accept TCM. We conducted a pilot testing of the main question assessing the willingness to accept TCM among over 50 respondents and did not detect any problems.Page 5/222.4 Sample size estimation and data analysis Based on a previous report [3], the proportion of TCM utilization was assumed as 84% in the calculation of sample size using the following formula: n = Z2 1 /2P(1 P)/e2. Where n is the minimum number of required patients, Z2 indicates 1.962 for 95% con\u0000dence interval (CI), P presented the estimated utilization rate, and e indicated the required accuracy of 4%. The non-response rate was estimated as 5% and the minimum sample size was calculated as 339 patients. Data analysis was performed using IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows (version 21.0). Participants' responses to the questionnaire were treated as classi\u0000ed data, which were expressed by numbers and percentages. Chi-squared test was used to evaluate the relationship between independent variables (participants' basic information and participants' attitude towards TCM) and dependent variables (participants' acceptance towards TCM). The variables with a value of P < 0.25 in univariate analysis were put into a multivariate logistic regression analysis to determine the factors affecting patients' willingness to accept TCM. Odds ratio (OR) and 95%CI were adopted to describe these variables. P < 0.05 was considered statistically signi\u0000cant. 3 Results 3.1 Participants' characteristics and willingness to accept TCM A total of 1,185 asymptomatic patients were invited to participate in the survey. One patient submitted an incomplete questionnaire whereas the response was not received from 63 patients. Finally, responses from a total of 1,121 patients were included in the analysis. The overall effective questionnaire recovery rate was 96.60%. In our study, 1024 participants expressed their willingness to receive TCM, the rate of TCM acceptance was 91.53%. Only 97 participants represented unwillingness to receive TCM, the rate of TCM hesitancy was 8.65% (Table 1). The relationship of various characteristics with the acceptance of TCM is presented in Table 1. The willingness to accept TCM differed insigni\u0000cantly (P > 0.05) between various demographic characteristics except for the monthly income. Having a monthly income of more than 3,000 yuan, the proportion of participants vaccinated with two doses of COVID-19 vaccines and understanding the culture of TCM were signi\u0000cantly higher for showing a willingness to accept TCM in comparison to those who showed unwillingness. 3.2 Participants' attitude towards TCMPage 6/22Table 2 shows signi\u0000cant statistical differences in attitude towards TCM between the TCM hesitancy and TCM acceptance groups (P < 0.001 for all the \u0000ve related questions). In our study, nearly one-\u0000fth of the respondents thought that TCM needed a longer time to take effect. Interestingly, most respondents believed that TCM treatment was safe (1013/1121, 90.37%) and effective (1019/1121, 90.90%), only 11.60% (130/1121) of the participants believed that TCM would delay their treatment. 3.3 Independent predictors of TCM acceptance According to single-factor analysis, 13 variables with P < 0.25 were obtained (Table 1 and Table 2). Multivariate logistic regression analysis indicated that 6 variables in\u0000uenced the willingness to accept TCM (P < 0.05) (Table 3). The participants who have received two doses of COVID-19 vaccine (OR = 2.069, 95%CI: 1.029-4.162, P = 0.041 vs not received), understood the culture of TCM (OR = 2.293, 95%CI: 1.029-4.162, P = 0.014 vs not understood), thought TCM needs a longer time to exert e\u0000cacy (OR = 1.607, 95%CI: 0.849-3.034, P = 0.145 vs not thought), thought the treatment of TCM is safe (OR = 2.856, 95%CI: 1.334-6.112, P = 0.007 vs not thought), thought the treatment of TCM is effective (OR = 2.724, 95%CI: 1.249-5.940, P = 0.012 vs not thought) , and those who informed their attending physician if using TCM for treatment (OR = 3.455, 95%CI:1.867-6.392, P < 0.001 vs not informed) were more likely to accept TCM treatment. However, the participants who thought TCM might delay your treatment (OR = 0.256, 95%CI: 0.142-0.462, P < 0.001 not thought) was unwilling to accept TCM treatment. 3.4 The Sources of information about TCM The present study found that the most important source of TCM information for the participants was the media (494/1121, 44.07%), followed by families and friends (459/1121, 40.95%) and medical staff (427/1121, 38.09%) (Figure 1). 3.5 Reasons for accepting TCM Regarding the reasons why 1,024 participants were willing to accept TCM treatment, 51.86% (531/1024) of the participants thought that TCM could improve immunity, and 47.75% (489/1024) believed that TCM could alleviate the symptoms of COVID-19. 44.53% (456/1024) considered that TCM could cure COVID- 19 (Figure 2). 3.6 Types of TCM that the participants were willing to accept Among the 1,024 participants who were willing to accept TCM, 70.51% (722/1024) preferred Chinese herbal medicine, 62.79% (643/1024) medicine, 34.96% (340/1024) chose moxibustion, and 29.00% (297/1024) were willing to accept cupping therapy (Figure 3). 3.7 Reasons for not accepting TCMPage 7/22For the reasons why 97 respondents were unwilling to accept TCM treatment, 36.08% (35/97) of the respondents reported that they did not receive doctors' recommendations, and 25.77% (25/97) of the respondents illustrated that they were afraid of the side effects of TCM, and 24.74% (24/97) of respondents showed that they did not need additional burden (Figure 4). 4. Discussion At present, the COVID-19 pandemic is still spreading all over the world, with constant mutation, which increases the di\u0000culty of prevention and control. TCM has a long history in the prevention and treatment of acute infectious diseases and the experiences of TCM treatment have been recorded in the Shanghan Lun and Detailed Analysis of Epidemic Warm Diseases [9], which provided a new scheme for treating COVID-19 [23-27]. However, the willingness to accept TCM among asymptomatic COVID-19 patients was not reported in the literature. The present study explored the acceptance of TCM and its independent predictors among asymptomatic COVID-19 patients and found that 91.53% of the patients were willing to accept TCM treatment, while 8.47% of the patients presented unwillingness to accept TCM. Demographic factors including gender, age, education level, income level, and residence were not signi\u0000cantly associated with TCM acceptance in the present study, which was different from the cross-sectional studies reported from other regions [28- 31]. National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China has repeatedly mentioned the promotion of TCM in the prevention and control of COVID-19, we put forward the following suggestions to accelerate the acceptance of TCM based on the results of this study. 4.1 Increasing the publicity of TCM is important to promote the acceptance of TCM TCM is a signi\u0000cant part of Chinese cultural heritage, which ideas and practice methods contain the profound wisdom of Chinese philosophy [32]. The multivariate logistic regression analyses indicated that participants who understood the culture of TCM was one of predictors for TCM acceptance, but more than half of the participants lacked an understanding of the culture of TCM regrettably, which is similar to surveys in other countries. A cross-sectional study in Australia reported that only 26% of dental students knew about CAM [33]. In Hungary, 12.4% of the subjects showed a better understanding of CAM [34]. In Bangladesh, nearly 45% of pharmaceutical students believed that lack of knowledge was the main obstacle to the application of CAM [35]. Given that TCM theory is di\u0000cult for non-professionals to understand, straightaway propaganda is necessary. Participants of the present study reported that the most important source of their TCM information was media (44.07%), followed by family members and friends (40.95%) and medical staff (38.09%). In India, the majority of dental practitioners (73.3%) reported that media (internet, newspapers, etc.) was their main source of knowledge about CAM [36]. One study in Silesia, Poland, demonstrated that 60.8% of patients obtained information about CAM from the internet and 38.6% acquired information from television. These results indicated that appropriate media publicity is conducive to guiding andPage 8/22enhancing the public's receptivity to TCM [37]. This raises requirements for TCM practitioners in China. On the one hand, they should continue to strengthen publicity through the media, especially the emerging network media such as WeChat, microblog, and Zhihu, to generalize the advantages of TCM to the public. On the other hand, carrying out public welfare activities, such as \"TCM enter communities\", \"TCM enter school\", can help in increasing awareness about TCM. 4.2 Clarifying the impact of TCM is the premise of advocating TCM According to the results of the present study, among the participants who were willing to accept TCM, 70.51% preferred Chinese herbal medicine, 62.79% chose Chinese patent medicine, and 34.96% favored massage treatment. A survey on Parkinson's patients in China illustrated that herbal medicine, rehabilitation exercise, and acupuncture were the most commonly used TCM therapies [38]. Compared to other TCM therapies, Chinese herbal medicine is the most popular treatment in China. The safety and e\u0000cacy of the TCM is critical to controlling the COVID-19 and has caused widespread concern. Multivariate logistic regression analysis in the current study showed that safety and e\u0000cacy of the TCM were the independent predictors for willingness to accept TCM. These results were higher than data from others countries. A survey on diabetic patients in Jeddah Saudi Arabia showed that 54.2% patients believed CAM have no side effect. A study in Indonesia indicated that 68.31% of diabetic patients considered that CAM products were safe and 63.69% of diabetic patients considered that CAM products were effective. However, considering TCM would delay the treatment was an important independent predictor for hesitation to accept TCM in this study. In fact, the clinical role of TCM in the management of COVID-19 has been veri\u0000ed by clinical trials in China [39,40]. Therefore, considering the willingness of asymptomatic COVID-19 patients to accept TCM and the effectiveness and safety of the TCM, clarifying the impact of TCM is the premise of advocating TCM for the patients. Inviting the recovering COVID-19 patients who were treated with TCM to give health lectures and broadcasting the clinical practice of TCM in the treatment of COVID-19 in the fangcang hospital may be the signi\u0000cant ways for asymptomatic COVID-19 patients to accept TCM treatment. 4.3 Active communication with attending doctors contribute to acceptance of TCM Communication between doctors and patients plays an important part in healthcare activities [41], which can determine the patients' self-management behavior and health outcomes [42]. Our study indicated that informing the attending doctor before receiving TCM treatment is an important in\u0000uencing factor for willingness to accept TCM treatment. A study conducted in Palestine from April 2018 to March 2019 exhibited that 64.0% of pregnant women believed that doctors should provide patients with advice on commonly used CAM therapies [43]. In Saudi Arabia, 81.11% of the subjects intended to discuss the application of CAM with their doctors [44]. According to the outpatient service in Iran, among 155 patients who accepted CAM voluntarily, 50 patients (32.2%) reported that they had disclosed the usage of CAM toPage 9/22their doctors [45]. These results suggested that patients had a strong interest in receiving CAM with the advice of their physicians. In the present study, when participants were asked the reason behind their willingness to accept TCM treatment, only 26.27% of the participants said that it was due to the recommendation by medical staff. When asked about their hesitation toward TCM treatment, 36.08% of participants replied that it had not been recommended by medical staff. Therefore, healthcare practitioners must have a certain understanding of CAM so that they can actively communicate with patients and recommend the most appropriate treatment according to the patients' conditions. According to a survey in Germany, more than half of the patients expressed their interest in CAM consultation and more than 80% of patients expected their attending doctor to have a certain knowledge of CAM [46]. In India, 57.5% of dental practitioners reported that health professionals should be able to provide patients with advice on commonly used CAM methods [36]. Therefore, we also suggested attending doctors could recommend TCM and teach some gongfa of TCM (tai chi, qi gong, wuqinxi, etc.) to bene\u0000t patients in the fangcang hospital. 4.4 Larger surveys are helpful for better understanding the patients' willingness Recently, this is the \u0000rst study all over the world to investigate the cognition, attitude, and willingness of asymptomatic COVID-19 patients to accept TCM, which can provide some reference for doctors to apply TCM in asymptomatic COVID-19 patients. However, it is worth noting that there are still some limitations in this study. First of all, this study is a self-administered questionnaire-based cross-sectional study. Thus, the causality cannot be directly deduced and further longitudinal research is needed to verify the possible causal relationship. Secondly, the questionnaire was developed based on multiple questionnaires but it could not be veri\u0000ed in a large sample size due to time constraints. Thirdly, the sample had a low representation of the elderly (> 60 years old) owing to few admissions of participants of this age to the fangcang hospital. Fourthly, since our survey was just conducted in the largest fangcang hospital in Shanghai, it cannot fully represent the willingness of asymptomatic COVID-19-infected people in Shanghai and even in the world. Fifthly, as the world is urgently \u0000ghting against COVID-19, more outcomes of TCM treatment for COVID- 19 will be published, which may affect the willingness of patients to accept TCM. 5 Conclusion To the best of our knowledge, the present study is the \u0000rst survey reporting the attitude and willingness to accept TCM in asymptomatic COVID-19 patients and their in\u0000uencing factors worldwide. In this survey, 91.53% of the participants were willing to accept CAM treatment, while 8.65% of the participants were not willing to accept CAM treatment. Receiving two dose of COVID-19 vaccine, understanding the culture of TCM, thinking TCM needs a longer time to exert e\u0000cacy, thinking TCM is safe and effective, and informing the attending doctor before using TCM were contributors to TCM acceptance, whereas the main contributors to TCM hesitancy was considering that TCM would delay the treatment. Further observation will be carried out on this batch of patients to calculate the \u0000nal prevalence rate of TCM andPage 10/22a long-term follow-up will be conducted to observe the effects of TCM on the quality of life of patients with COVID-19.
