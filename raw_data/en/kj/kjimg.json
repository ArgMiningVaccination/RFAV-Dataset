A large and very active research eld is dedicated to identifying biosynthesized compounds, to improve/develop new methodologies to produce /reuse natural compounds and to assess their potential for pharmaceutical, cosmetic and food industries, among others, and also to understand their mechanism of action. Here, the main results presented in each work are highlighted. The applications suggested are mostly related to pharmacological uses and involve mainly pure natural compounds and essential oils. These works are signicant contributions and reinforce the dynamic eld of natural products applications. Keywords: natural compounds; therapeutic applications; essential oils; antimicrobial; antitumor; SAR 1. Introduction The compounds produced by nature exhibit a great diversity of chemical structures as a result of the long, selective and evolutive process of species [ 1], and they constitute the active principles of natural products which have always contributed, a lot, to improve human living conditions [ 2]. As natural products have widespread uses in traditional medicine [ 3-5], and a wide range of biological eects demonstrated scientically, they possess high scientic and industrial value [ 6-9]. The properties demonstrated by natural compounds constantly encourage scientic research in aspects that lead to signicant advances in the identication of new natural compounds, evaluation of the biological activity displayed, understanding of how they cause a biological e ect, in the development of new applications and in all cases with benecial results for humanity. Despite very signicant advances in medicine, many diseases such as cancer, infections, diabetes and cardiovascular diseases remain without a ordable, eective and safe therapy. Due to this, the most frequently explored area with relevant results is the development of new drugs from natural sources [ 7,8,10-14], with natural product-based new drugs being 51% of small molecules approved and launched in the market between 1981 and 2014 [ 15]. The demand for natural antimicrobial agents and anticancer drugs is a very active research point [ 16-20] since cancer and infectious diseases are a signicant cause of mortality worldwide [ 21]. Moreover, the World Health Organization predicts that the incidence of cancer will continue to rise to over 11 million in 2030 [ 22]. More than 1700 clinical trials involving the natural vinca alkaloids to treat cancer are registered currently on the clinicaltrials.gov platform [ 23]. Furthermore, the resistance and undesirable side e ects of antibiotics and antineoplastic agents used in the clinic [ 24,25] have become pressing problems, leading to a continuous search for new inhibitors with new mechanisms of action. Appl. Sci. 2020 ,10, 4025 ; doi:10.3390 /app10114025 www.mdpi.com /journal/applsci 1Appl. Sci. 2020 ,10, 4025 The application of natural compounds as antioxidant agents is also a hot topic [ 26-29], once several diseases are, at least partially, a result of free radicals' imbalance [ 26,30,31]. Overproduction of oxygen free radicals, when associated with the deciency in antioxidant repair or defence mechanisms, will cause oxidative damage leading to disease development like cancer, inflammation, diabetes, cardiovascular and aging-associated diseases [ 26,30-32]. Natural products are also applied as an ingredient in cosmetic preparations [ 33,34] and in the food industry since they exhibit useful preservative properties [ 35,36]. The limited availability of a natural product is a di culty when it is a promising molecule for an application. Thus, recently, it has been proposed that several techniques that can improve the natural product yield. It is the case of metabolomics, enable the rapid identication of novel compounds in complex mixtures of natural products, metabolic engineering of cells endowed with the ability of overproduction of new products and metagenomics exploring novel metabolites from microorganisms present in several environments but which remain recalcitrant to culturing [ 37-39]. Natural compounds are privileged structures because of their structural diversity and multiple biological activities. They are undoubtedly the ideal compounds for the rational design of new drugs and the development of new chemical entities with therapeutic potential [ 8,14]. Thus, research on natural compounds is necessary and very welcome. This Special Issue is dedicated to present the most recent results about the development of natural compounds applications. Ten original research works, organized by applications, and two reviews are included in this Special Issue. Each of them contributes to the knowledge advance, insofar asthey present new applications for known products, new methodologies to obtain new products or the evaluation of a given application, with the applications related to health promotion being the most frequently considered. 2. Contributions Several original papers included in this Special Issue involve the search for new antibacterial and antifungal agents, mainly from secondary metabolites, their derivatives and essential oils of di erent plant species. Essential oils are a mixture of volatile compounds, mainly mono-, di- and sesquiterpenes, with high commercial value and a wide range of applications [ 19,40]. Piper caldense (Piperaceae family) is popularly used for the treatment of snakebites, stomach problems and as a sedative [ 41]. The research presented by Bezerra et al. [ 42] shows that essential oils from P . caldense leaf are composed, in major proportions, by sesquiterpenes such as caryophyllene oxide, spathulenol, -cadinene and bicyclogermacrene. Although the essential oils do not show antifungal activity against Candida albicans , they exhibit a synergistic e ect with the antifungal fuconazole, which increase their activity when used combined. This modulator e ect is not observed at the highest concentration. The ability of essential oils to cause complete inhibition of the hyphae prolongation was also demonstrated, being an e ect superior to fuconazole [ 42], which suggests their application as an adjuvant in antimicrobial formulations. Helianthus annus (Asteraceae, sunflower) has been used as a traditional medicine to treat a variety of ailments, such as rattlesnake, spider, snake and scorpion bites, fevers [ 43,44], food poisoning [ 45], burning sensation in the vagina and worms in the ears [ 46]. Lawson et al. [ 47] report the chemical composition and antifungal activity of essential oils from the aerial parts of two cultivars of H. strumosus of these essential oils shows they are qualitatively similar and dominated by monoterpenes, in particular sabinene, -pinene, -pinene and limonene. The antifungal activity of essential oils and their main constituents were evaluated against three opportunistic pathogenic fungal species, Aspergillus niger essential oils of H. annus \"Chianti\" and H. strumosus are the most active against C. neoformans and the authors consider that the activity is due to both enantiomers of pinene. 2Appl. Sci. 2020 ,10, 4025 Carvacrol is a usual essential oils constituent, that exhibits activity against Penicillium digitatum , a citrus crop fungal which causes signicant economic losses [ 48], but whose mechanism of action is not completely claried. Using an innovative approach, metabolomics based on1H-NMR analysis, Wan et al. [ 49]determine the changes introduced into the P . digitatum metabolism and its energetic balance when this fungus is treated with carvacrol. The results show this compound inducesROS production on P . digitatum , which mainly disturbs the energy production by a decrease in glycolysis followed by an augmentation in gluconeogenesis involving mainly alanine, aspartate and glutamate metabolism. Phenolic nor-triterpene are described in the literature as antibacterial agents against Gram-positive bacteria [ 50-52]. Moujir et al. [ 53] report the antimicrobial activity of ve natural and Maytenus canariensis , and four pristimerin derivatives synthesized. The most active compound was the derivative6 -hydroxy-2,3-diacetoxy-pristimerol which is more active than the positive control cephotaxime against spore-forming bacteria and Staphylococcus epidermidis . A comprehensive structure /activity relationship (SAR) study was performed with the aim of the rational design of antimicrobial agents based on the phenolic nor-triterpene sca old. In addition to an application as antimicrobials, natural compounds, in pure form or as a mixture like essential oils, are also investigated as therapeutic agents with a potential application on other health problems like aging-associated diseases, cancer, diabetes or wounds. Portulaca oleracea is used to alleviate a wide range of illnesses [ 54] and the extracts of this plant are known to possess a strong in vivo antioxidant capacity [ 55,56]. Based on the potent antioxidant activity of natural compounds oleracones isolated from this plant, Yoon et al. [ 57] carried out the synthesis of oleracones D-F and evaluated their lifespan extension properties using the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans as the experimental aging model. The oleracone E was the most active to extend the lifespan of nematodes. Therefore, this compound should be considered in the development of anti-aging formulations. Another study where the antioxidant activity of natural compounds was assessed is proposed by Tungmunnithum et al. [ 58]. They optimize and validate a new green and fast microextraction procedure to obtain a phenolic acids-rich fraction from almond Prunus residue. The authors identied some of the most abundant constituents, protocatechuic, p-hydroxybenzoic, chlorogenic and p-coumaric acids and evaluated the antioxidant activity of this fraction. They suggest it as a source of antioxidant natural compounds with applications in food preservation, as medicine and in cosmetic preparations. Thus, it is given a contribution to value a very abundant by-product of the almond oil industry. Salvia miltiorrhizae is one of the well-known traditional herbal medicines that has increased its scientic interest for its remarkable bioactivity against cardiovascular disease, renal damage, tumor angiogenesis and tumor cell invasion [ 59,60]. Kang et al. [ 61] evaluate a series of compounds isolated from S. miltiorrhizae Radix such as tanshinone IIA, rosmarinic acid, salvianic acid salvianolic acid B and caeic acid for their cytotoxic activity and mode of action against the HCT-116 cell line (human colorectal cancer, one of the most commonly diagnosed malignant diseases [ 62]). Only a terpenoid, tanshinone IIA, shows an inhibitory e ect on cell survival (IC 5061.6g/mL). Morphological changes observed by Hoechst staining, an increase in cleaved caspase-7 and -8 and Bax expression as well as a decrease in Bcl-2 show this compound as an inducer of apoptosis which may be a useful chemotherapy strategy for patients with colorectal cancer. The flavonoid-type compounds named chalcones and flavanones are natural isomeric compounds which exhibit a broad range of patented therapeutic applications [ 63]. Since they are chemically very labile, chalcones and flavanones are also excellent sca olds to medicinal chemistry and development of new drugs [ 64-66]. In this context, the optimization of the aldol condensation synthesis route by using unexplored bases to prepare hydroxylated and methoxylated chalcones and flavanones proposed by Rosa et al. [ 67] is well come. The application of the synthesized compounds as cytotoxic, 3Appl. Sci. 2020 ,10, 4025 antioxidant, antibacterial and anticholinesterase agents were evaluated, and SAR are discussed. The SAR study showed the same substituent group can cause an opposite e ect on the level of di erent biological activities, given as a signicant contribution to better understand the medicinal chemistry of these compounds. Plants are also considered to be sources of natural compounds with antidiabetic activity, as shown by Numonov et al. [ 68]. They studied the chemical composition of essential oils from Prangos pabularia roots and describe it as a potent protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP-1B) inhibitor. Additionally, the authors used docking studies and experimental procedures to indicate coumarin osthole, one of the most abundant constituents, as probably responsible for the potent PTP-1B inhibition, a stronger eect than the positive control, and thus support the use of P . pabularia roots' essential oil and osthole as antidiabetic agents. Propolis and honey are valuable natural products with several health applications already described in the literature [ 69,70]. However, the properties and chemical composition of these natural products signicantly depend on several factors such as the plant species used in their production [ 71]. Using dierent samples of Portuguese honey, propolis and a mixture of both, Afonso et al. [ 72] present an original study where the antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and wound-healing activities of ethanolic extracts of these samples were evaluated. The study demonstrates that propolis extracts have higher phenolic compounds and flavonoid contents than honey extracts. On the other hand, the mixtures of honey/propolis exhibit, in general, a signicant wound-healing e ect, but the propolis extract 2 (propolis from the red-honey box) is the most active sample, this activity being related to its high antioxidant and anti-inflammatory e ect. The Special Issue also includes two review articles where the applications of natural sesquiterpene lactones and rosmarinic acid as potential medicines are reviewed. Moujir et al. [ 73] the results of in vivo studies and clinical trials involving these compounds. The work demonstrates the enormous potential of these compounds in the development of new drugs especially for the treatment of oncological and inflammatory diseases. Their application as antifungal, antitrypanosomal and analgesic agents is also discussed, although the most surprising results are related to their sensitizing e ect to the action of some clinical drugs, which means their application in combination therapy. Some synthetic derivatives of these sesquiterpene lactones are also highlighted, mainly because they demonstrate very signicant improvements in pharmacokinetics and selectivity, compared with the original compounds. In its turn, Nadeem et al. review the therapeutic value of rosmarinic acid [ 74]. This natural phenolic compound, very abundant on several edible species such as Rosmarinus ocinalis ,Ocimum tenuiflorum and Thymus mastichina , exhibits a range of biological e ects. The authors [ 74] present and discuss and nephroprotective e ects. Further, the mechanism of action is discussed, although the authors identied this aspect as the knowledge gap that needs further investigation. This Applied Sciences Special Issue emphasizes natural compounds' potential for distinct applications. The authors, from all over the world, contribute with valuable manuscripts to this Special Issue, strengthening the high value of natural compounds and the dynamism of this research eld.

DC. (Piperaceae) Jos \u00e9Weverton Sciences, Milan State University, 20133 Milan, Italy 5Department of Biomedical, Surgical and Dental Sciences, Milan State University, 20142 Milan, Italy; elena.varoni@unimi.it 6Laboratory of Microbiology 15 January 2020 Abstract: Infections by multiresistant microorganisms have led to a continuous investigation of substances acting as modiers of this resistance. By following this approach, the chemical composition of the essential oil from Piper caldense leaf and its antimicrobial potential were investigated. The antimicrobial activity was determined by broth microdilution method providing values for minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), IC 50, and minimum fungicidal concentration (MFC). The essential oil was tested as a modulator for several antibiotics, and its e ect on the morphology of Candida albicans (CA) strains was also investigated. The chemical characterization revealed an oil composed mainly of sesquiterpenes. Among them are and bicyclogermacrene (6.7%) with the highest concentrations. The essential oil showed very low activity against the strains of CA with the lowest values for IC 50and MFC of 1790 g/mL and 8192 g/mL, respectively. The modulated the activity of fluconazole against CA URM 4387 strain, which was demonstrated by the lower IC 50obtained, 2.7 g/mL, whereas fluconazole itself presented an IC 50of 7.76g/mL. No modulating e ect was observed in the MFC bioassays. The e ect on fungal morphology was observed for both CA INCQS 40006 and URM 4387 strains. The hyphae projection was completely inhibited at 4096 g/mL and 2048 g/mL, respectively. Thus, the oil has potential as an adjuvant in antimicrobial formulations. Keywords: /MS 1. Introduction Infections caused by fungi, are the major problem of hospital infections, mainly due to the emergence of new infections and the generalized resistance to antibiotics [ 1]. Due to the rapid resistance acquired by microorganisms the search for natural products with antimicrobial activity has Appl. Sci. 2020 ,10, 631 ; doi:10.3390 /app10020631 www.mdpi.com /journal/applsci 9Appl. Sci. 2020 ,10, 631 been constant in recent years and drugs derived from plants have contributed largely to human health, historically representing a source for the creation of new drugs [ 2]. One way of combating microbial resistance is the investigation of substances that can act as resistance modiers by combining common antimicrobial drugs with some phytochemicals, and in some cases observed synergism [ 3,4]. Yeasts of the genus Candida are found as commensals in the human organism, however, because of factors that disturb the dynamics of the host can favor the growth of these fungi, from supercial infections to systemic infections [ 5]. Among the yeasts of this genus, Candida albicans stands out as the main cause of infections, being a species with great ability to change its morphology, a necessary factor for its virulence and pathogenicity [ 6,7]. For the treatment of infectious diseases, populations without access to medicines, especially those from underdeveloped and developing countries, use medicinal plants to combat disease. Such use of these vegetables is due to a number of advantages, such as their availability, low purchasing power and being in popular knowledge for several generations [ 2,8]. Among the species of the Brazilian flora, the genus Piper L. is one of the largest in the Piperaceae family, with 290 species and 45 varieties occurring in Brazil [ 9]. Some species of the genus are used as a flavoring of food and treatment of diseases [ 10]. A scientic study evidenced the antimicrobial potential of four species of the genus against Staphylococcus aureus and three strains of Candida , including C. albicans [11]. Among the species of the genus, Piper caldense C. DC., is popularly known in Brazil as \"pimenta d' \u00e1gua\" or \"pimenta d'arda\", being commonly used for the treatment of snake bites, sedative and stomach problems [ 10]. Research using P . caldense essential oil has revealed promising antimicrobial potential [ 12,13]. In view of the above problem, this study aimed to evaluate the antibiotic and modulator potential of volatile terpenes of P . caldense against Candida albicans , as well as to determine if the natural product is capable of reducing pleomorphism. Finally, it was evaluated by gas chromatography which terpenes were present in the essential oil. 2. Results2.1. Chemical Composition The chromatographic analysis of the essential oil of P . caldense identied 25 phytochemical constituents, corresponding to 94.3% of the total composition. Sesquiterpenes are the main class observed, reaching a percentage of 89.7% of the sample. Monoterpenes were found in very low concentration (4.6%). There were no major constituents ( >20%) and no constituent in trace concentration (<1%). All the identied phytochemicals (6.7%) the highest concentrations (Table 1). 2.2. Antifungal Activity2.2.1. Cell Viability Curve and IC 50 Regarding the antifungal activity of the essential oil of P . caldense , it was found that it has a low antifungal eect against strains of C. albicans because the IC 50values were high, 2256.24 and 1790.24 for the CA INCQS 40006 and CA URM 4387, respectively (Table 2) (Figures 1and 2). However, it was observed that for the C. albicans URM 4387 strains, the oil potentiated the e ect of the drug used, fluconazole, since it had an IC 50of 7.73g/mL alone, and when associated with the essential oil, the value of evaluated parameter dropped to 2.7 g/mL, i.e., a signicant reduction. It is noteworthy that for C. albicans 40006 strains, no potentiating e ect was found for fluconazole but an antagonistic eect, since there was an increase in the IC 50of the oil associated with fluconazole. Thus, based on the behavior of the curve through non-linear regression, the IC 50values of P . caldense oil were clinically irrelevant when evaluated alone. 10Appl. Sci. 2020 ,10, 631 Table 1.

Anti- Candida potential of essential oil of Piper strains of Candida albicans URM Curve and Minimum Fungicidal Concentration (MFC) In determining MFC it was considered those samples capable of inhibiting the growth of the fungal colonies. Thus, for the CA INCQS 40006 line, none of the products alone or in combination were able to totally inhibit colony growth, since MFC was 16,384g/mL (Table 3). However, there was an MFC for the oil against CA URM 4387, in which fluconazole alone and combined with P . caldense oil showed a much lower MFC, 16 g/mL, so that the oil did not modulate the fungicidal e ect of fluconazole for this lineage (Table 3). Table 3. Minimum fungicidal concentration (MFC) of essential oil of Piper caldense (EOPc) and fluconazole associated and isolated Control. URM: University Recife Mycology. 2.2.3. Activity of the Piper caldense in the Control of Virulence of Candida albicans In the evaluation of the activity of the oil in the morphology of the yeasts of C. albicans , the eect was caused by impoverishment of the culture medium, so that the yeasts project the hyphae and pseudohyphae in search of nutrients. For the growth control of CA INCQS 40006 (Figure 3, Slides 1-7), it is possible to observe the formation of several hyphae (S1), whereas in the treatments with fluconazole, there is a signicant decrease in the hyphae projection (S2-4), resulting in a complete inhibition of hyphae at concentration of 4096 g/mL (S2). The EOPc showed a similar result, being as eective as fluconazole. For the CA URM 4387 strain, fluconazole at a concentration as low as 8 g/mL could diminish the virulence (Figure 4, S2). The oil at higher concentrations, such as 2048 g/mL (S3), was able to inhibit the hyphae projection; on the other hand, at concentration of 512 g/mL (S5), there was a signicant decrease in hyphae projections. 12Appl. Sci. 2020 ,10, 631 Figure 3. Eects of essential oil of Piper caldense on the of essential oil of Piper caldense the at the concentration of 8 g/mL. S3-5: Eect of essential g/mL (S4), 512 g/mL (S5). 3. Discussion The genus Piper L. presents a high number of species with medicinal, insecticidal and condiment applications, since the representatives are sources of volatile oils produced by the secondary metabolism [ 14]. Some species of this genus present antifungal activities, such as Piper amalago L. [15],Piper aduncum Peperomia pel \u00facida(L.) antibacterial activity, among them Piper betle L. [17]. Thus, the selection strategy of P . caldense for the investigation of the antimicrobial activities of this study was based on chemotaxonomy, since there is a phylogenetic relationship between P . caldense and other species of the genus and possibly in the evolutionary historical branch the biosynthetic routes are similar [ 18]. The phytochemicals (monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes) of the essential oil of the species under study were elucidated by Rocha et al. [ 19], however, there were marked di erences in the constitution, the rst is that in our study, the caryophyllene oxide was the major constituent (13.9%), whereas in the results of the aforementioned study this sesquiterpene is not present in the oil of leaves, but in the stem essential oil (6.2%). In addition, Rocha et al. [ 19] states that the constituent in higher percentage is the -cadinol, reaching compose 19% of the total composition, and in our study this sesquiterpeno is in 13Appl. Sci. 2020 ,10, 631 low percentages (4.2%). This variation is justied by several factors, both intrinsic and genetic, as well as extrinsic factors such as geographic origin of the plant, cultivation, collection form, and especially the period of the year that was collected [ 20-22]. Although the essential oil of P . caldense did not present antifungal activity in low concentrations (500g/mL), it presented a modulating e ect for fluconazole against strains of C. albicans URM 4387. So that this nding is relevant, since introduction of azole class antibiotics (miconazole, econazole, ketoconazole, fluconazole and triazonazole) for the treatment of infections caused by Candida species, a growing emergence of resistant Candida species has been observed [ 23,24]. The activity of caryophyllene oxide, an oxygenated terpenoid, was tested in the laboratory against dermatophyte fungi, showing signicant results, and their activity has been compared with antifungals such as cyclopiroxolamine and sulconazole [ 12]. Silva [ 25], evaluating the antifungal activity of 2-geranyl-3,4-dihydroxybenzoic acid and 3-geranyl-4-hydroxyxidozoic acid, both substances isolated from the fruits of P . caldense , demonstrated, respectively, a moderate and high activity against C. albicans strains (LM-86 and LM-111), so that the rst substance showed a MIC of 512 g/mL for both strains and the second one 32 g/mL, also for the two strains. It is important to highlight that in our study the essential oil was used as the product, and this is a mixture of mono and sesquiterpenes, whereas in the study mentioned above the substances were derived from the benzoic acid prenylate, so that the chemical structures are quite di erent. Inhibition of virulence of C. albicans strains by natural products was also shown by other scientists, among them Santos et al. [ 26], who evaluated the essential oil of Eugenia uniflora L. (Myrtaceae) and demonstrated that at concentrations of 8192 g/mL there is inhibition of hyphal projection. Two other species also from the same family that have the ability to inhibit the virulence of C. albicans arePsidium brownianum Mart. ex DC. And Psidium guajava L., the former having medicinal properties and is used to combat infections caused by fungi of the genus Candida [6,27]. The activities of the natural products, concerning the antimicrobial agents act by diverse mechanisms of action such as the disintegration of the cytoplasmic membranes, destabilization of the motor proton force (MPF), altering the polarization of the membrane, and the coagulation of the cellular content [ 28-30]. 4. Materials and Methods 4.1. Botanical Material The collection of leaves of Piper caldense was performed in the municipality of Piraquara in the state of Paran \u00e1, Brazil, under the coordinates 2529.693/primeS and 4900.844/primeW at 528 m elevation (Figure 5). An exsicata was identied and deposited in the Herbarium of the Faculdades Integradas Esp \u00edrita under voucher 9.103. 4.2. Extraction of Volatile T erpenes and Determination of the Chemical Composition Healthy P . caldense leaves were selected and dried in a incubator at 40C. After dehydration, the leaves were crushed to increase their contact surface and maximize the extraction of their volatile components. For such extraction, the hydrodistillation system was used, in which 50 g of the plant material was placed in a volumetric flask with 1000 mL of distilled water, being constantly heated for 4.5 h, until the oil extraction [ 21]. For the chemical characterization of P . caldense essential oil, it was made by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC /MS). Initially, the essential oil was diluted in dichloromethane to 1% concentration, then 1 L of this solution was injected (1:20) into Agilent 6890 chromatograph, coupled to Agilent 5973N mass selective detector, wherein the injector temperature was 250C. For the separation of the constituents, helium gas was used as a carrier (1 mL /min) and an HP-5MS capillary column with phenyl-95%-dimethylpolysiloxane, 30 m \u00d70.25 mm\u00d7 0.25m. For the heating ramp, the temperature started at 60C with a heating rate of 3C/min to 14Appl. Sci. 2020 ,10, 631 240C, totaling 60 min. The mass detector was operated in the electronic ionization mode (70 eV), at a rate of 3.15 s1sweeps and a mass range of 40 to 450 u. The transfer line was maintained at 260C, the ion source at 230C and the analyzer (quadrupole) at 150C. Figure 5. Location of the species Piper caldense in the municipality of Piraquara in the state of Paran \u00e1, Brazil. For quantication, the diluted samples were injected into an Agilent 7890A chromatograph equipped with a flame ionization detector (FID), operated at 280C. We employed the same column and analytical conditions described above except for the carrier gas used, which was hydrogen at a flow rate of 1.5 mL /min. The percentage composition was obtained by the electronic integration of the FID signal by dividing the area of each component by the total area (area%). For the determination of chemical constituents, the mass of the constituents was compared with the library (NIST and Wiley) e and also by their linear retention indexes, calculated from the injection of a homologous series of hydrocarbons (C 7-C26) and compared with data from the literature [ 31]. 4.3. Drugs, Reagents, Solution Preparation and Fungal Strains For the antifungal test, the essential oil stock solution was prepared from 0.15 g and diluted in 1 mL of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). To obtain the initial concentration of 16,384 g/mL, the stock solution was diluted in sterile distilled water so that the DMSO concentration in the natural product had no activity in the cells tested. The reference antifungal was fluconazole (Capsule-FLUCOMED), diluted in sterile water at the same oil concentration [ 27]. For microbiological assays, two Candida albicans strains were INCQS 40006 (standard strain), obtained from the Oswaldo Cruz Culture Collection of the National Institute for Quality Control in Health (INCQS) and CA URM 4387 (clinical isolate), provided by mycology collection of the Federal University of Recife (URM - University Recife Mycology). For the antifungal the culture Sabouraud Dextrose Agar (PDA) culture medium prepared with solidication Agar was used. The media were prepared according to the supplier's guidelines (Difco\u00ae) and autoclaved at 121C within 15 min. 15Appl. Sci. 2020 ,10, 631 4.4. Determination of Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) To perform this experiment the broth microdilution method was used according to Javadpour. First the yeasts were inoculated in ASD and kept incubated at 37C for 24 h. Subsequently, the inoculum were prepared by transferring small aliquots of the strains to tubes containing sterile saline, the inoculum were compared to McFarland scale resulting in a concentration of 1 \u00d7105cells/mL. 96-well plates were lled containing in each well 100 L of SDB and 10% fungal inoculum. The plates were then microdiluted with 100 L of the essential oil of P . caldense, where the well concentrations were from 8192 g/mL to 64 g/mL. The last well was not diluted as a growth control. Media sterility controls and substance dilution controls were also used, using only saline without fungal inoculum. The plates were incubated at 37C for 24 h and subsequently read on a 630 nm wavelength ELISA spectrophotometer (Thermoplate\u00ae). All assays were performed in triplicate and the results obtained were used to construct the cell viability curve and the IC 50of essential oil and fluconazole [ 6,32]. MIC was dened as the lowest concentration able to reduce the fungal growth curve. 4.5. Evaluation of Modulating Activity of Natural Product The essential oil was tested at sub-inhibitory concentration (MIC /16) according to the method proposed by Coutinho et al., 2008 [ 33]. The plates were lled with a solution containing SDB, fungal inoculum and the essential oil, then 100 L of fluconazole was mixed into the rst well and serially microdiluted at a ratio of 1:1 to the penultimate well, at 1 g/mL. Control of culture media sterility and antifungal dilution control were performed, and the MIC of fluconazole was also determined. The tests were performed in triplicate and the plates were incubated at 37C for 24 h. The reading was performed in an ELISA spectrophotometer (Termoplate\u00ae). The modulatory activity is dened when used in combination. The natural product enhances the action of the antifungal, showing synergism. If the opposite occurs and the natural product interferes with the action of the drug, the e ect is considered antagonistic. 4.6. Determination of Minimum Fungicidal Concentration (MFC) After the MIC test, a sterile stem was placed in each well of the plates, rst the stem was used to mix the solutions contained in the wells, then small aliquots with medium, inoculum and essential oil were transferred to Petri dishes containing solid medium SDA, for yeast subculture and verication of cell viability. After 24 h of incubation, the plates were analyzed and the concentration at which no fungal colony growth was observed is considered the Minimum Fungicidal Concentration of the essential oil [ 34]. 4.7. Eect of Natural Product on Fungal Morphology To verify whether P . caldense volatile terpenes cause any change in fungal morphology by inhibiting hyphae emission, micromorphological sterile chambers were mounted for yeast observation. On the blade chamber (sterile) were poured 3 mL of medium PDA, poor nutrient for dilution, containing the natural product in CFM /4 concentrations CFM /8 and CFM/16. Aliquots of fungal inoculum were taken from SDA-containing Petri dishes to make two parallel strips in the solidied solid medium (PDA) and then covered by a sterile coverslip. The chamberwere taken to the incubator and after 24 h (37C) the culture was visualized under optical microscopy using a 400 X objective. A camera was attached to the microscope for image capture. A control for yeast growth (with hyphal emission stimulated by depletion of the medium) was performed, as well as a control with the reference antifungal fluconazole was also used for comparative purposes [ 35]. 4.8. Statistical Analysis The IC 50was calculated by means of linear regression. Subsequently, data from P . caldense antifungal assays were investigated (ANOVA), using the Bonferroni 16Appl. Sci. 2020 ,10, 631 test and considered signicant when p<0.05. All analyzes were performed on the GraphPad Prism 6.0 software. 5. Conclusions The essential oil of P . caldense presented mono- and sesquiterpene components, though not presented a major constituent. In addition, it showed low antifungal activity for C. albicans strains but was able to modulate the e ect of standard drug (fluconazole) and decreased the virulence of these strains. In this way, the oil has in its composition constituents that are promising in the formulation of drugs used in the treatment of infectious diseases. Author Contributions: H.D.M.C. and M.F.B.M.-B.

The aerial parts of two cultivars of Helianthus strumosus , were collected from locations in north Alabama. The essential oils were obtained by hydrodistillation and analyzed by gas chromatography\u2014mass spectrometry. The Helianthus essential oils were dominated 7.1%, and 3.8%, respectively). The essential oils were screened against three opportunistic pathogenic fungal species, Aspergillus niger ,Candida albicans , and sensitive fungus was C. neoformans with minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values of 78, Helianthus L., the sunflowers, is a genus in the family Asteraceae, tribe Heliantheae, made up of 51 North American species [ 1].Helianthus annuus L. (common sunflower) is native to North America and the current range of wild forms of H. annuus are central and western United States, southern Canada, and northern Mexico [ 2]. The common sunflower is one of the earliest domesticated plants in the Americas. There is evidence that the plant was domesticated in Tabasco, Mexico, around 2600 B.C. [ 3], and independently in the southeastern United States around 2800 B.C. [ 2,4]. Several Native American tribes used H. annuus in traditional medicine [ 5]. For example, the White Mountain Apache used a poultice of the crushed plants to treat snakebites; the Hopi used the plant as a spider bite medicine; the Jemez applied the juice of the plant to cuts; the Pima used a decoction of the leaves to treat fevers [ 5]; and the Zuni natives of New Mexico used the roots to treat rattlesnake bites [ 6]. In addition, H. annuus is used as a traditional herbal medicine in many locations where it has been introduced. Ethiopians use H. annuus in teas to treat food poisoning [ 7]. In Bangladesh the seeds and /or the flowers are crushed and used for snake bites, scorpion bites, and a variety of other ailments, such as burning sensation in the vagina and worms in the ears [ 8]. Helianthus strumosus L. (woodland sunflower) is a rhizomatous perennial plant, growing up to two meters tall and is native to eastern North America [ 9-11]. These plants are strongly aromatic. Leaves are up to 10 cm long and cuneate to subcordate in shape. The composite flower heads can be Appl. Sci. 2019 ,9, 3179 ; doi:10.3390 /app9153179 www.mdpi.com /journal/applsci 21Appl. Sci. 2019 ,9, 3179 up to 9 cm at the peduncle. The ray flowers are a dark yellow color with orange-brown disc flowers in the center. These flowers are common along roadsides and in open elds and are sometimes found in forests. The Iroquois used a decoction of the roots as an anthelmintic [ 5]. Invasive fungal infections are becoming increasingly common in immunocompromised patients, such as those receiving cancer chemotherapy, transplant patients receiving immunosuppressant drugs, and HIV patients [ 12]. The predominant 12].Aspergillus niger is a haploid lamentous parasitic fungus that is commonly known for the disease \"black mold\" on fruits, vegetables, and nuts [ 17].Aspergillus conidia (fungal \"spores\") are environmentally widespread and inhalation can lead to opportunistic pulmonary aspergillosis, chiefly attributed to A. fumigatus ,A. flavus , and A. tubingensis , as well as A. niger [18]. In immunocompromised individuals, however, the infection can progress to invasive systemic aspergillosis [ 19].Candida albicans is another opportunistic pathogenic fungus that commonly colonizes the human body [ 20]. The organism can cause supercial infections of the mucosa, but can lead to invasive candidiasis in immunocompromised patients [ 21]. Cryptococcosis is a fungal infection caused byCryptococcus neoformans [22]. The fungus is widespread in the environment and typically enters the body through inhalation where it can cause pulmonary infection [ 23]. However, the organism has the ability to cross the blood brain barrier and in immunocompromised patients, cryptococcosis can lead to cryptococcal meningoencephalitis with increased intracranial pressure [ 24,25]. As part of our continuing investigation of antifungal activity of essential oils [ 26] as well as essential oils from the Asteraceae growing in north Alabama [ 27], we have collected and analyzed the essential oils from the aerial parts of H. annuus and H. strumosus , and we have carried out in vitro antifungal screening of the essential oils against A. niger ,C. albicans , and C. neoformans . 2. Materials and Methods2.1. Plant Materials The two cultivars of H. annuus (\"Chianti\" and \"Mammoth\") were cultivated, grown without fertilizer or pesticides, in a rural area near Gurley in north Alabama (3438/prime29\"N, 8624/prime39\"W, elevation 199 m) and the aerial parts were collected on 4 and 6 August 2018. Aerial parts of H. strumosus were collected on 10 August 2018 from wild-growing plants near Huntsville, Alabama (3442/prime42\"N, 8632/prime35\"W, elevation 354 m). The plants were identied by S.K. Lawson. Voucher specimens have been deposited in the herbarium of the University of Alabama in Huntsville (20180729-183243 and 20190402-111732). The fresh plant materials (78.14, 80.32, and 65.47 g, respectively) were hydrodistilled using a Likens-Nickerson apparatus with continuous extraction with dichloromethane for 3 h. The dichloromethane was carefully evaporated, and the residual essential oils weighed using an analytical balance to give the essential oils (82.3, 20.3, and 24.0 mg, respectively). 2.2. Gas Chromatographic\u2014Mass Spectral Analysis The Helianthus essential oils were analyzed by GC-MS with a Shimadzu GCMS-QP2010 Ultra with a ZB-5 capillary column as previously described [ 28]. Identication of the chemical components was carried out by comparison of the retention indices, calculated with respect to a homologous series of normal alkanes using the arithmetic index [ 29], and by comparison of their mass spectra with those reported in the Adams [ 30], NIST17 [ 31], FFNSC 3 [ 32], and our own in-house library [ 33]. Concentrations shown in Table 1(average of three measurements \u00b1standard deviations) are based on peak integration without standardization. 22Appl. Sci. 2019 ,9, 3179 Table 1.

Antifungal Screening Assays The Helianthus essential oils were technique as previously described [ 26,34]. Antifungal screening was carried out in triplicate. 3. Results and Discussion3.1. Essential Oil Compositions Hydrodistillation of Helianthus aerial parts gave pale yellow essential oils in 0.105%, 0.025%, and 0.037% , respectively. 24Appl. Sci. 2019 ,9, 3179 The essential oil compositions for the three essential oils are compiled in Table 1. A perusal of the table reveals that the three Helianthus essential oils are qualitatively similar. The annuus \"Mammoth\" was by oil was also rich in -pinene (58.65%), as well as myrcene (9.79%) and bornyl acetate (4.97%). The compositions of H. annuus essential oils cultivated in north Alabama are very similar to those reported by Adams and co-workers for populations growing in the southern plains of the United States [ 35]. The essential oils of H. annuus from Pisa, Tuscany, Italy [ 36]; Lagos, Nigeria [ 37]; or from western United States [ 35] had much lower concentrations of -pinene and correspondingly higher concentrations of germacrene D. In marked contrast to the essential oils of Helianthus , essential Heliantheae) from were devoid of -pinene, but rich in sesquiterpene hydrocarbons [ 27]. 3.2. Antifungal Activity The Helianthus essential oils were screened for antifungal activity against three potentially pathogenic fungi, Aspergillus niger ,Candida albicans , and Cryptococcus neoformans , as shown in Table 2. The most susceptible fungus was C. neoformans . Both H. annuus \"Chianti\" and H. strumosus essential oils showed minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values of 78 g/mL. It is tempting to suggest that the major component, -pinene, is responsible for the observed anti- Cryptococcus activity; all three Helianthus essential oils have around 50% -pinene. Furthermore, -pinene has shown antifungal activity against C. neoformans with an MIC around 70 g/mL [ 38,39]. In addition, -pinene-rich (46.1%-pinene) commercial Myrtis communis essential oil showed a similar antifungal activity against C. neoformans (MIC=78g/mL) [ 26]. Conversely, commercial Cupressus sempervirens essential oil, 49.7% -pinene was less active against C. neoformans (MIC=313g/mL) [ 26]. There may be synergistic or antagonistic ects of-pinene with minor components. Limonene [ 39,40] and-pinene [ 39], have also shown antifungal activity against C. neoformans ; camphene, however, was inactive [ 41]. Although we do not know which of the enantiomers is present in the Helianthus essential oils, we have screened both ( +)- and ()--pinene, (+)- and ()-limonene, and ( )--pinene against the three fungal strains, as shown in Table 2. Consistent with previous investigations, ()--pinene and (+)-limonene both showed activity against C. neoformans with MIC values of 39 and 78g/mL. Furthermore, both enantiomers of -pinene were active against C. neoformans ; MIC=20 and 39g/mL for (+)- and ()--pinene, respectively. Table 2.

Sci. 2019 ,9, 3179 4. Conclusions Helianthus essential oils have been shown to be rich in - and-pinenes, sabinene, and limonene, and have demonstrated poor antifungal activities against A. niger and C. albicans , but promising activity against C. neoformans (although much lower activity than the reference antifungal drug amphotericin B). These and other monoterpene-rich essential oils deserve further exploration as alternative and complementary agents to combat fungal infections; further studies against more susceptible fungi are recommended.

Carvacrol has long been studied for its natural antifungal potential and food preservative potential. However, its exact mode of action, especially against carvacrol against P . were imbalanced in the fungal hyphae. A strong positive correlation was seen between aspartate, glutamate, alanine, and glutamine, with a negative correlation among and lactate. These metabolic changes revealed that carvacrol-induced oxidative stress had disturbed the energy production and amino acid metabolism ofP . digitatum . The current study will improve the understanding of the metabolic changes posed by plant-based fungicides in order to control citrus fruit green mold caused by P . digitatum . Moreover, the study will provide a certain experimental and theoretical basis for the development of novel citrus fruit preservatives. 1. Introduction Rotting of fruits and vegetables have been a frequent and serious problem for thousands of years. Even in developed countries, the citrus yield loss reaches up to 25%, with developing countries facing almost double this yield loss of citrus crop. This yield loss is causing serious annual economic losses and creating hurdles for the development of the citrus fruits-related industry [ 1]. Citrus fruits (Family Rutaceae, subfamily Aurantioideae) are highly susceptible to decay caused by more than 20 postharvest fungal infections leading, to approximately half the crop wasted due to fungal diseases [ 2]. Among various fungal strains, Penicillium fungi cause serious plant diseases and damage to the citrus crop during storage, accounting for about 10-30% [ 3]. The P . digitatum infects the citrus fruits, causes green mold disease, and generates huge (60-80%) yield losses under ambient conditions [ 4]. In order to control such fungal disease-mediated yield losses, prochloraz, imazalil, and thiabendazole are extensively used as potential antifungal agents [ 5]. The literature reported serious health issues Appl. Sci. 2019 ,9, 2240 ; doi:10.3390 /app9112240 www.mdpi.com /journal/applsci 29Appl. Sci. 2019 ,9, 2240 aroused by excessive use of certain routine and synthetic antifungal agents. Over the past few decades, the intentions have been to ensure the hygiene and safety levels of fruit products along with promoting maximum biodegradability. In order to achieve this ambition, researchers are still trying to screennatural products with strong antifungal potential from plants. Moreover, it has also been tried to explore new preservation technologies that can replace synthetic fungicides. Compared with synthetic fungicides, natural antifungal substances have attained much attention in recent years [ 6-9]. Various essential oils rened from Melaleuca alternifolia have strong inhibitory e Wehmer and P . digitatum Sacc., and hence can be used as natural preservatives in agricultural and food processing [ 10]. Previously we have reported that cinnamaldehyde contained in cinnamon has a good antifungal e ect against P . italicum and claries the method for dynamic detection of the antifungal e ect of cinnamaldehyde [ 11]. In addition, GC-MS and GC-FID techniques successfully separated the essential oils linalyl acetate (53.76%) and flowers of Citrus aurantium var amara, neroli oil appeared as the best fungistatic agent, which [ 12]. Carvacrol (5-Isopropyl-2-methylphenol) is the major volatile oil constituent from Labiaceae family plants, such as oregano, mint, and thyme [ 13]. Carvacrol has many edible applications, antifungal, insecticidal, antitumor, and other e of P . and P . italicum inin vitro and in vivo experiments of lemon [ 15]. Another study in Morocco, reported that Thymus leptobotrys and T. riatarum have carvacrol contents of 76.94% and 32.24%, respectively, and the former species has the highest bioactivity among the tested plant species in that study. In addition, the study reported a complete inhibition of germination of the spore of P . digitatum and P . italicum at 500L/L[16]. The the antimicrobial showed that carvacrol, cinnamaldehyde, and trans -cinnamaldehyde signicantly reduced the growth of P . digitatum ; particularly, the carviniol appeared as the most e ective remedy to control P . digitatum [17]. Metabolomics is an important part of systems biology, which is quite similar to genomics and proteomics [ 18]. Metabolomics is distinguished from other related sciences in terms if its ability to nd the relative relationship of metabolites with physiological and pathological changes through quantitative analyses of metabolites with low molecular weight (1000) [ 19]. Recently, the1H-NMR based metabolomics approach was used to reveal the antimicrobial mechanism, which generally includes amino acid biosynthesis and energy-associated metabolism [ 20,21]. Although carvacrol already been proved to have signicant antifungal properties, the underlying mechanism is not clear yet. In the current study, we applied the1H-NMR-based metabolomics approach to evaluate the antifungal potential of carvacrol on P . digitatum and explored the underlying antifungal mechanism. Moreover, how carvacrol-induced oxidative stress disturbs the energy production and amino acid metabolism in P . digitatum shall also be studied through metabolic proles. 2. Materials and Methods2.1. Chemicals Carvacrol (purity 99%) purchased from Shanghai Aladdin Co., Ltd. (C804847), and because of its insolubility in water, it was previously dissolved in ethanol (50%, w/w) to obtain a stock solution with a proper concentration of 10 mg \u00b7mL1. 2.2. Preparation of P . Digitatum Spores The highly pathogenic fungus P . digitatum was isolated from an infected orange with typical green mold symptoms and maintained on potato dextrose agar (PDA: 200 g peeled potatoes, 20 g glucose, 18 g agar powder and 1 L distilled water) medium plates at 25C. The preparation of P . digitatum spore suspension was based on a previous method [ 22], and the tested pathogen was incubated at 25C for 30Appl. Sci. 2019 ,9, 2240 7 days. The seven-days-old plate was washed with sterile water and then gently dispersed by spread bacteria beads to release spores. Finally, the spore suspensions were ltered through a sterile cotton ball in a funnel to remove mycelia and PDA fragments and adjusted to the suitable concentration of 1\u00d7106spores mL1with the aid of a hemocytometer. 2.3. the mycelial growth of P . digitatum was determined as previously reported [ 22]. Briefly, the 0, 0.0625, 0.125, 0.25, 0.5, and 1 mL of carvacrol stock solution was diluted with 2, 1.9375, 1.875, 1.75, 1.5, 1 mL of sterile 0.5% Tween 80 and mixed with 18 mL of PDA for obtaining the nal concentrations of 0 (control), 0.03125, 0.0625, 0.125, 0.25, and 0.5 mg \u00b7mL1. The mycelial disks (5 mm in diameter), cut from the periphery of a seven-days-old culture using a stainless-steel punch, was placed in the center of each Petri dish (90 mm in diameter). Then, all plates were incubated at 25C for seven days. Four replicates were used per treatment and the experiment was carried out at two separate times. Mycelial growth inhibition (MGI) of carvacrol treatment against control was following equation: MGI (%)=DcDt Dc5\u00d7100 where Dcand Dtwere the mean colony diameter of control and treated sets, respectively. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) was dened as the lowest carvacrol concentration that completely inhibited the growth of P . digitatum after 48 h of incubation at 25C. The minimum fungicidal concentration (MFC) was considered the lowest concentration of carvacrol with no visible fungal growth on a PDA plate after a following 5 days incubation at 25C[22]. 2.4. The Eect of Carvacrol on Mycelial Weights and Water-Retention Rate The eects of carvacrol on the wet and dry weights as well as the water-retention rate of P . digitatum mycelial were determined by the method described by Tian et al. with some modications [ 23]. Briefly, 100Lo f P . digitatum into 50 mL of potato dextrose broth (PDB) medium and then was incubated in a rotary shaker (150 rpm) at 25C. After shake incubating for 48 h, the carvacrol solution at nal concentrations of 0 (control), 0.03125, 0.0625, 0.125, 0.25 and 0.5 mg\u00b7mL1were added into the above-mentioned PDB and then incubated for 24 h at 25Ci na rotary shaker. The mycelia from the carvacrol treated and control PDB was collected by ltering used a Buchner funnel and washed three times with sterile water. The wet weights of the mycelia were measured, the mycelia were dried at 70C for 12 h, and the dry weights were then measured using an analytical balance (Ms105, Mettler Toledo, Greifensee, Switzerland). The water-retention rates of the carvacrol-treated and control groups were calculated using the following equation: Water-retention rate (%)=WwWd Ww\u00d7100 where Ww and Wdwere the mean of wet and dry weights in carvacrol treated and control sets, respectively. 2.5. Sample Preparation for1H NMR Spectroscopy The collected mycelial treated with MIC carvacrol for 4, 8 and 12 h respectively were washed three times with pre-cooled PBS bu er solution and then added with 3.8 mL pre-cooled methanol-water mixture (1/0.9, v/v). The mixture was placed on the ice for 4 min of sonication bathing, and then added with 4 mL trichloromethane. After full oscillation, the mixture was centrifuged at 4C and 10,000 rpm for 10 min. The upper methanol water phase was placed in the nitrogen blowing instrument (NBI, 31Appl. Sci. 2019 ,9, 2240 HSC-24B, Tianjin Hengao Technology Development Co. Ltd, Tianjin, China) to blow o the methanol, and then the supernatants were freeze-dried, and then stored under 80C until NMR analysis [ 11]. In the NMR measurements, the samples were dissolved in 550 mL 99.8% D 2O phosphate buer (0.2 M, pH=7.0), which contained 3-(trimethylsilyl) sodium propionate -2, 2, 3, 3-d4 (TSP). After rotating for 15 s and centrifuging for 10 min at 12,000 rpm and 4C, the supernatant was transferred to a clean nuclear magnetic resonance tube (5 mm) for analysis. The1H-NMR spectrum was recorded in the 298 K at 500 MHz nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (Bruker Avance III, Bruker Germany). Field-frequency locking with D 2O and TSP was used as a reference for chemical shift (1H, D 0.00). The carrpurcell-meiboom-gill sequence [90 (t-180-t) n-acquisition], which is edited by lateral relaxation, has a total spin-echo delay (2 n t) of 40 ms. The spectra were recorded in 64K data points with 128 scans, ranging from 5-15 ppm. By multiplying FIDS with exponential weighting function (corresponding to line broadening at 0.5Hz), Fourier transform was performed on the spectrum. 2.6. Spectral Pre-Processing and Data Analysis All1H NMR spectra were phase and baseline corrections, and the peak was manually calibrated using Topspin software (Bruker BioSpin GmbH, version 3.5, Rheinstetten, Karlsruhe, Germany). Then the peak was exported to ASCII le using Mestrec (version 4.9.6, Mestrelab Research SL, Santiago de Compostela, Spain) and imported into R software ( https://www.r-project.org /) for further analysis. The region containing residual water signal was removed. The spectrum was combined with an adaptive intelligent algorithm. Before multivariate data analysis, the remaining trash cans were the probability quotient normalization and Pareto scale. Orthogonal signal correction partial least squares discriminant analysis (OSC-PLS-DA) was used to reveal the metabolic di erences among groups. Score charts are used to show clustering between categories, and load /s charts are used to identify di erent metabolites between two groups. Di erential metabolites are metabolites in the upper right quadrant and the lower left quadrant of the S diagram. According to the correlation coe cient from blue to red, the loading graph is color coded. The model was validated internally by repeated two cross-validations and externally by a permutation test. 2.7. Statistical Analysis Data on the inhibitory e ects of carvacrol on mycelial growth, mycelial weights, and water-retention rate were analyzed by variance analysis (ANOVA) using the SPSS version 17.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). The signicant di erence of means was performed with the Duncan's test at p<0.05. 3. Results3.1. Eects The on the growth of P . digitatum was quite obvious and a signicant growth inhibition on PDA medium was seen in a dose-dependent manner ( p<0.05) (Figure 1). The increasing carvacrol concentrations had higher mycelial growth inhibition (MGI). As a whole, over one-fth of the P . digitatum mycelial growth was 0.0625 mg /mL of carvacrol, but 0.125 mg/mL concentration inhibited more than half (54.84%) of the mycelial growth. The higher carvacrol concentrations (0.25 and 0.5 mg /mL) completely inhibited the mycelial growth of P . digitatum (Figure 1). Based on the observation of P . digitatum in mycelial growth on PDA medium with carvacrol treatments at 0, 0.03125, 0.0625, 0.125, 0.25, and 0.5 mg /mL during the incubation period at 25C, carvacrol treatments at the concentrations of 0.125 mg /mL and 0.25 mg/mL completely inhibited P . digitatum in mycelial growth at the 2nd day and 7th days of incubation, respectively. Therefore, the values of MIC and MFC were 0.125 mg /mL and 0.25 mg/mL, respectively (MGI) of P. digitatum on PDA. Bars indicate the mean \u00b1standard deviation (S.D.) and those labeled with di erent letters ( a,b,c,d, and e) were signicantly di erent according to Duncan's test ( p<0.05). 2nd day 7 th day Figure 2. The eect of the growth diameter of P . digitatum treated with dierent concentrations of carvacrol (0, 0.03125, 0.0625, 0.125, 0.25, and 0.50 mg /mL) at 2 days and 7 days post-inoculation (dpi). 3.2. Eects of Carvacrol on Mycelial Weights in The mycelial weights of P . digitatum in carvacrol treatment and control groups are shown in Table 1. The data showed that mycelial growth biomass was strongly inhibited with increasing the carvacrol concentration. Initially, the wet and dry weights were 3.736 g and 0.393 g /100 mL at the lower carvacrol concentration of 0.0625 mg /mL, respectively. At higher carvacrol concentrations (0.125, 0.25 and 0.50 mg/mL), the eect on mycelial weights was recorded at a signicant level ( p<0.05) in comparison with the control group. Table 1. The mycelial weights and water-retention rate of P . digitatum treated with several concentrations of carvacrol. Concentrations (mg/mL)Mycelial Weight (g /100 mL) Water-retention Rate (%) mean\u00b1S.E. The data followed by di erent letters within the column are signicantly di erent according to Duncan's test ( 2240 on Water-Retention Rate of P . Digitatum Water is the main component in the fungal cell and account for about 90% of mycelial fresh weight and plays an important role in regulating of cell osmotic pressure. The water-retention rate is used as an index of lipid peroxidation that is related to membrane damage leading to cell aging. The lower water-retention index shows higher membrane damages, and vice versa. The e ect of carvacrol on the water-retention rate of P . digitatum mycelia is shown in Table 1.D ierent concentrations of carvacrol treatments were used to evaluate the mycelial membrane damage. The water-retention rate ofP . digitatum mycelia was decreased and treated by carvacrol in a dose-dependent manner. The results demonstrate that the water-retention rate of P . digitatum mycelia was more signicantly inhibited by the higher concentrations (0.125, 0.25, and 0.50 mg \u00b7mL1) of carvacrol. 3.4. Metabolites Identied in 1H-NMR Spectra The representative 500 MHz1H-NMR spectra of mycelia obtained from the control group and MIC carvacrol administration group are shown in Figure 3. Chemical shifts assignments of metabolites were shown in the Supplementary Material (Supplementary Table S1). Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) was allocated by searching publicly-accessible metabolome databases (such as the Human Metabonomics Database and Madison Qingdao Metabonomics Joint Database) based on chemical changes reported in the literature. Figure 3. The typical 500 MHz CPMG1H-NMR spectra for 2 groups. Keys: 1. Isoleucine; Valine; 30. Formate. 3.5. Multivariate Analysis of 1H-NMR Spectral Data To evaluate the antifungal activity of carvacrol on P . digitatum , the OSC-PLS-DA model was constructed and all NMR data obtained from the control group (CK) and carvacrol administration group (D) at 4, 8 and 12 h were analyzed. In Figure 4B-D, each point manifested a sample, and each clustering represented a corresponding metabolic pattern in di erent groups. Figure 4B shows that the two groups were not well separated at 4 h. However, with the passage of time, the control group and the drug group were separated further and further, and the CK and D groups were the furthest away in the scores plot at 12 h (Figure 4D). This result shows that the metabolomic changes in D group increased from 4 h to 12 h. At 12 h, the metabolic spectrum of group D changed fundamentally, reflecting the rapid response of the strain to carvacrol. The trajectory plot (Figure 4A) also exhibited a good separation between the CK and D groups, showing an apparent time-dependent antifungal activity of carvacrol on P . 2019 Figure 4. Score trajectory of the OSC-PLS-DA analysis in the CK group and D group at 4, 8, 12 h. (B-D): Scores plots of CK and D groups at 4 h, 8 h, and 12 h, respectively. In the 12 h S-plot (Figure 5B), dierent shapes and colors of the dots show di erent metabolites. The contribution of these metabolites to the group is related to their distance to the center; variables farther away from the center contribute more to the group separation. On the basis of the correlation coecient, the 12-hours loading plots (Figure 5C,D) are coded with cold and warm tones, and the correlation increases gradually from blue to red. Signicant and adenine were found in the carvacrol dosed group. Figure 5. OSC-PLS-DA analysis of NMR data at 12 h. ( A) The OSC-PLS-DA Score plot. ( B) S-plot. (C,D) Color-coded loadings plots. The use of color bars, where red and blue represent metabolites, is statistically signicant or insignicant in facilitating the separation of groups.

Discussion The current study comprehensively evaluated the antifungal activity of carvacrol against P . digitatum through1H-NMR path analysis to determine biologically patterns hyphae (Figure 6). These metabolisms were also found in the correlation network of D group at 12 h. A strong positive correlation between aspartate, glutamate, alanine, and glutamine was seen, and a negative correlation between glutathione and lactate was also observed. These metabolic changes revealed 36Appl. Sci. 2019 ,9, 2240 that carvacrol induced the generation of heavy oxidative stress to disturb the energy and amino acid metabolism of P . digitatum (Supplementary Figure S1). A signicant decrease in the level of glutamate, glutamine, glycine and precursors of glutathione was observed in the D group. As an ROS scavenger, the level of glutathione also markedly decreased in the D group. Glutathione being endogenously expressed antioxidant enzyme that played an important role in the protection of cells against ROS by quickly eliminating free radicals [ 24]. Glutathione was consumed in large quantities in fungi against carvacrol-induced ROS. To sustain a certain level of glutathione in fungus, the synthesis of glutathione from glutamate, glutamine and glycine has to be enhanced [ 25], which will lead to the degradation of glutamate and glycine. In addition, a heavy load of ROS could enhance peroxidation of membrane lipids, leading to damage the cellular membranes [ 26]. The decreased level of choline and ethanolamine were seen in the D group compared with the CK group, and both are considered as the key players in the stability and integrity of cell membranes [ 27]. Therefore, any decrease in choline and ethanolamine may be due to excessive utilization for repairing the damaged membranes caused by ROS which are indicators of decreased level of sarcosine in Dgroup [ 28]. In the current study, the sarcosine level in group D was lower than that in group CK, and was linked with the decrease of choline and glycine levels. These results reflect the disturbance of ROS to the sarcosine pathway caused by carvacrol. The self-protection mechanism of fungus made it consume huge amounts of energy to avoid ROS mediated stress and repair the cell membranes. In order to produce more ATPs, the aerobic respiration in fungal hypha was enhanced while the glycolysis pathway was checked to a greatextent. Such reduction in glycolysis was supported by the decreased level of lactate in D group. In addition, a marked decrease in phenylalanine, alanine, aspartate, and arginine levels was observed in D group. The glycogenic amino acids underwent degradation [ 29] and reflected an enhancement in the gluconeogenesis pathway that compensates the deciency of glucose. The results further suggested that carvacrol helps produce energy and amino acid metabolic disorders in P . digitatum . A the transcriptional initiators e.g., uracil and adenine were found in the D group compared with the CK group (Table 2)[30]. The increased level of uracil and adenine revealed that carvacrol caused RNA damage to P . digitatum . In this pioneering study, the antifungal activity of carvacrol against P . digitatum was studied by using the metabolomics approach based on1H-NMR. Carvacrol can cause an abnormal metabolic state of P . digitatum by interfering with di erent metabolic pathways such as energy and amino acid metabolisms. Furthermore, carvacrol could also induce damage to the RNA molecules and ROS production. Metabolomics provide a powerful and feasible tool for evaluating antifungal activity and exploring its potential mechanism. Figure 6. (A) In this study, metabolic analysis was used to analyze the pathway topology related to antifungal activity. The term \"log p\" is the conversion of the original p value calculated from enrichment analysis, and \"impact\" is the path impact value calculated from the path topology analysis.

Abstract: The emergence of pathogenic bacteria-resistant strains is a major public health issue. In this regard, natural product sca olds oer a promising source of new antimicrobial drugs. In the present study, we report the antimicrobial activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria and addition to four derivatives ( 6-9), three of them reported for the rst time. Their stereostructures have been elucidated on the basis of spectroscopic one-dimensional (1D) and two-dimensional (2D) NMR techniques, spectrometric methods, and comparison with data reported in the literature. To understand the structural basis for the antimicrobial activity of this type of compounds, we have performed an in-depth study of thestructure-activity relationship (SAR) of a series of previously reported phenolic nor-triterpenes. The SAR analysis was based on the skeleton framework, oxidation degree, functional groups, and regiosubstitution patterns, revealing that these aspects modulate the Maytenus ; celastroloids; semisynthesis; antibacterial 1. Introduction The resistance of common pathogens to standard antibiotic therapies is rapidly becoming a major public health problem all over the world [ 1], and consequently, there is a need to develop new structural and mechanistic classes of antibiotic agents. In this regard, the development of new antibiotics inspired in natural product sca olds seems the best short-term solution to address antibiotic resistance [ 2]. The Celastraceae family is distributed mainly in tropical and subtropical regions of the world including North Africa, South America, and East Asia, and their species have a long history in traditional medicine [ 3]. The most representative genus in this family is Maytenus , with more than 225 species [ 4]. In the Amazonian region, species of this genus are well known for their use in the treatment of rheumatism, gastrointestinal diseases, and as an antitumoral for skin cancer [ 4]. The therapeutic potential of Maytenus species has been mainly attributed to celastroloids, chemotaxonomic markers of the family [ 5]. The term celastroloid refers to methylenequinone nor-triterpenes [ 6] and pristimerin [ 7]a r e the rst and most frequently reported celastroloids, and later on, this term was extended to related phenolic nor-triterpenes [ 5,8] and their dimer and trimer congeners [ 9]. This particular class of natural products shows a wide range of bioactivities, including cytotoxic [ 10,11], anti-inflammatory tingenone, and netzahualcoyone (Figure 1) exhibit inhibitory activity against Gram-positive bacteria [ 8,16,17], and the mode of action of netzahualcoyone against Bacillus subtilis and Escherichia coli has been investigated [ 18,19]. Regarding the phenolic nor-triterpenes, studies on their antimicrobial activity, mechanism of action against Gram-positive bacteria, and preliminary structure-activity relationship have been reported [ 20-25]. Figure 1. Most frequently reported antimicrobial celastroloids from Celastraceae species. As part of an intensive investigation into antimicrobial metabolites from Celastraceae species, we report herein on the inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of ve natural phenolic nor-triterpenes (1-5) and four derivatives ( 6-9), three of them reported for the rst time, against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, and the yeast Candida albicans . The structure-activity relationship study of compounds 1-9was expanded by the known antimicrobial activity of a series of phenolic nor-triterpenes ( 10-26), previously reported by our research group [ 20-23,25], to deepen our knowledge of the structural requirements for their activity. 2. Materials and Methods2.1. General Procedures Optical rotations were measured on a Perkin Elmer 241 automatic polarimeter in CHCl 3at 25C, and the [ ]Dvalues are given in 101deg cm2g1. UV spectra were obtained in absolute EtOH on a JASCO V-560 instrument. IR (lm) spectra in CHCl Bruker IFS 55 spectrophotometer.1H (400 or 500 MHz) and13C (100 or 125 MHz) NMR spectra were recorded on Bruker Avance 400 or 500 spectrometers; chemical shifts are given in ppm and coupling constants in hertz. Samples were dissolved (CDCl 3:H7.26,C77.0). EI-MS and EI-HRMS were recorded on spectrometer. Silica gel 60 (particle size 15-40 m) for column chromatography and silica gel analytical Biotech. Shimadzu (HPLC) equipment consisted of a pump LKB 2248 solvent delivery module, SPD-6V detector set at 254 nm, using a semipreparative silica gel column (Waters -Porosil\u00ae,1 5c m\u00d71.6 mm, particle size 10 m). The mobile phase consisted of a mixture of n-hexane-EtOAc (8:2) in isocratic mode with a flow rate of 9 mL /min. The degree of purity of the compounds was over 95%, as indicated by a single peak in HPLC and NMR. All solvents used were of analytical grade (Panreac), and the reagents, used without purication, were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Pristimerin, used as starting material, was isolated from the root bark of M. blepharodes and M. canariensis, as previously described [ 20(6-oxoiguesterol) from and 26(8-epi-6-deoxoblepharodol) [ 21] were obtained following the methodology previously described [ 20,21]. The structures of these compounds are depicted in Figure 2. Moreover, the semisynthesis of derivate 6, not previously described, was achieved by acetylation of pristimerin, a main quinone-methide triterpene isolated from the root bark of Maytenus species [ 27]. In addition, derivatives 7-9were prepared by catalytic reduction and further acetylation of pristimerin. Derivative 7is a known synthetic compound [ 31] whose1H and13C NMR data have not been previously assigned, whereas derivatives 8and 9are reported herein for the rst time (Scheme 1, Figures S1-S4.). 2.2.1. Preparation of Compound 6 To a stirred solution of pristimerin (31.0 mg) in pyridine (0.15 mL), anhydride acetic (0.1 mL) and a catalytic amount of 4-dimethylamino-pyridine were added. The resulting orange-red solution was stirred for 14 h at room temperature, until TLC showed complete conversion. This yellow solution was concentrated under reduced pressure, and the residue was puried by preparative TLC using n-hexane-EtOAc (1:1) C-21), 30.4 (t, C-12), 30.9 (t, C-19), 31.2 (s, C-17), (q, C-28), 33.1 (q, C-30), 34.5 (t, C-22), 35.1 (t, (t, (s, (39), 551 (14), 534 (52), 506 (32), 492 (100), 450 (42), 201 (95); EI-HRMS m/z556.3032 34H46O7, (622.0 mg) and Pd /C 5% (100 mg) in acetic acid (15 mL) was stirred under 1 atmosphere of hydrogen for 3 h. The reaction mixture was ltered through a pad of celite, the solution quenched by addition of saturated aqueous sodium bicarbonate solution, and the aqueous residue extracted with dichloromethane (3 \u00d730 mL). Then, to the crude, pyridine (1.5 mL) dissolved in acetic anhydride (1.5 mL) was added, and the reaction mixture was stirred for 12 h at room temperature. Upon completion of the reaction, the solution was concentrated on a cold nger with liquid nitrogen. The residue was puried by HPLC using n-hexane-ethyl acetate (8:2) as eluent to give compound 7 (21.9 mg, 2.9%, t R=11.4 min), reported elsewhere [ 31], and derivatives 8(76.4 mg, 10.3%, t R=12.3 min) and 9(32.1 mg, 4.3%, t R=12.6 min), not previously reported.

Antimicrobial Activity Strains used for determining antimicrobial included Bacillus Culture Spanish Collection), Pseudomonas aeruginosa AK 958 (from the University of British Columbia, Department of Microbiology collection), Salmonella sp . CECT 456, Klebsiella oxytoca Candida albicans CECT 1039. The bacteria cultures were developed in nutrient broth (NB) or brain heart infusion broth (for E. faecalis and M. smegmatis containing 0.06% Tween 80), and the yeast was cultured in Sabouraud liquid medium at 37C. All culture media were purchased from Oxoid. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were determined for each compound in triplicate by broth microdilution method (range 0.08-40 g/mL) in 96 well microtitre plates, according to the M07-A9 of the CLSI (Clinical and Laboratory Institute) [ 32]. Wells with the same proportions of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) were used as controls and never exceeded 1% ( v/v). The starting microorganism concentration was approximately 1-5 \u00d7105CFU/mL, and growth was monitored by measuring the increase in optical density (OD) at 550 nm (OD 550) with a microplate reader (Multiskan Plus II, Tritertek, Huntsville, AL, USA) and viable count in agar plates. The MIC was dened as the lowest concentration of compound that completely inhibits growth of the organisms compared with that of the control after incubation time. 44Appl. Sci. 2019 ,9, 2957 3. Results and Discussion 3.1. Chemistry Compounds 1-5,10,12-17,20,22,and 25(Figure 2) were isolated, puried, and characterized in our laboratory from two Maytenus species, M. blepharodes and M. canariensis , as previously described [ 20, 21,27]. Derivatives 11,18,19,21,23,24,and 26, achieved by acetylation or methylation from natural compounds, are described by Gonz \u00e1lez et al. [ 20] and Rodr \u00edguez et al. [ 21]. Moreover, derivatives 6-9were prepared from pristimerin (Scheme 1). The semisynthesis of 6was achieved by acetylation of pristimerin, and derivatives 7-9were obtained by catalytic reduction and further acetylation of pristimerin, as described in the experimental section. Their structures were greatly aided by comparison of their spectroscopic data with those previously reported for related compounds 24-26[21]. Even so, a complete set of two-dimensional (2D) NMR spectra (COSY, ROESY, HSQC and HMBC) was acquired for the new derivatives to gain the complete assignment of the1H and13C NMR resonances (see Experimental Section, Figures S1-S4). Derivative 7was identied as the previously described 2,3-diacetylpristimerol [ 31], however, its1H and13C NMR assignments have not been previously reported. Moreover, derivatives 6,8,and 9are described herein for the rst time, and their structures were elucidated as described below. Figure 2. Natural and derivatives phenolic nor-triterpenes included in the SAR studies. SAR: structure- activity relationship. Scheme 1. Synthesis of analogues 6-9from pristimerin. 45Appl. Sci. 2019 ,9, 2957 Derivative 6was obtained as a pale yellow amorphous solid with [ ]20 D39.7 (c 0.15, MeOH). The molecular formula, aromatic (1459 and 758 cm1). Two acetoxy and a carboxylic methyl ester group in 6were evident from the1H NMR signals at 2.29 (3H, s), 2.33 (3H, s), and 3.54 (3H, s), in methoxy groups, the13C NMR and DEPT data revealed 29 carbon resonances, including one carboxylic carbon, one aromatic ring, one trisubstituted double bond, one oxymethine carbon, ve sp3quaternary carbons, one seven methylenes, NMR data, including HSQC,1H-1H COSY, ROESY, and HMBC experiments, and comparison with data reported for pristimerol ( 24)[30] indicated that 6is a C-9, and C-10 established the structure of A and B rings. The regiosubstitution of the acetate groups and the relative conguration of H-6 were deduced by a 3). Thus, the structure of 6was established as 6-hydroxy-2,3-diacetoxy-pristimerol. Figure 3. Selected HMBC (single arrow) and ROE (doubled arrow) correlations for compound 6. Derivative 7was assigned the molecular formula C 34H46O6, determined by EI-HRMS. The mass spectrum exhibited peaks characteristic to acetate groups (M+-15-60, m/z475, CH spectra, which included signals for two acetyl groups ( H 2.28 (s), 2.31 (s), C20.4 (q), 20.7 (q), 168.4 (q), 168.7 (s)). Its1H NMR spectrum showed signals for six methyl groups ( H0.58, 1.08, 1.17, 1.22, 1.35, and 2.06), a methoxy at H3.55, a vinylic proton H7.00 (s). The13C NMR spectrum displayed 34 signals, which were assigned to one methoxy, eight methyls, eight methylenes, three methines, carboxylic carbons. Extensive study of the2,3JC-Hcorrelations (HMBC) allowed us to establish the structure of A and B rings and build the nor-triterpene skeleton for 7. The regiosubstitution of the acetate groups was deduced by a ROESY experiment, showing ROE e ects between H-1 /OAc-2 and Me-23 /OAc-3. This data established the structure of 7as 2,3-diacetoxy-pristimerol. Compounds 8and 9, both with the molecular formula C 34H48O6(EI-HRMS), dier from that of 7by the presence of two additional hydrogen atoms. The most remarkable di erence in their NMR spectra, when compared to that of compound 7, was the absence of the double bond C-7-C-8. Thus, in the13C NMR spectra of 8and 9, the signals assigned to C-7 and C-8 resonated in the region of aliphatic carbons ( C18.2 and 43.5 in 9). Moreover, dierences between 8and 9were also observed for the chemical shifts of Me-25 ( H1.60,C27.3 in 8, andH1.46,C36.8 in 9) and 2019 ,9, 2957 Me-26 (H0.88,C15.9 in 8, andH1.21,C25.8 in 9). Analysis of 2D COSY, HSQC, and HMBC spectra allowed us to dene their core structures. The ROE e ects of H-8/Me-25 and Me-26 observed in a ROESY experiment for compound 8, and those of H-8 /Me-27 observed for compound 9, further supported the stereochemical assignment for epimers 8and 9. Their structures were also conrmed by chemical correlations; hydrolysis of 8and9yielded compounds whose spectroscopic data were identical to those previously reported for 6-deoxoblepharodol ( 25) and 8- epi-6-deoxoblepharodol ( 26)[21], respectively. Consequently, the structure of compounds 8and9were to be 2,3-diacetyl-6-deoxoblepharodol and 2,3-diacetyl-8- epi-6-deoxoblepharodol, respectively. Evaluation Compounds 1-9were tested on Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, and the yeast Candida albicans by the broth microdilution method. Moreover, compounds 24-26, closely related to 6-9, were also assayed against B. alvei ,B. megaterium, and B. pumilus for SAR studies. The results (see Table 1) showed that spore-forming bacteria, such as the genus Bacillus are more sensitive to these compounds, among which compounds 6and 24exhibiting higher activity (MIC values of 1 and 2.5 g/mL against B. subtilis and B. cereus , respectively) than cephotaxime, used as a positive control. Furthermore, the eectiveness against the Gram-positive cocci was restricted to compound , MIC 5-2.5 and respectively). On the other hand, compounds 1-9were inactive against the Gram-negative bacteria and the yeast C. albicans (MIC>40g/mL), which is in line with previous studies on this type of compound [ 20-23,25].

Compounds 23(5.72) were inactive against all microorganisms assayed.3Cephotaxime was used as a positive control. 3.3. Structure-Activity Relationship Analysis The influence of substitution patterns of the phenolic nor-triterpenes on their antimicrobial activity was analyzed, taking into account three regions of the triterpene skeleton, the phenolic moiety, the extended B-ring triterpene sca old (pristimerin, tingenone, or iguesterin). This analysis revealed the following trends in the structure-activity relationship (SAR) (Figure 4). Regarding the results obtained against Bacillus spp., the SAR studies suggest that: (a) A substituent at C-4 seems essential for the activity. Thus, comparison of the activities (MICs against B. subtilis )o f14, 10,12,and 1, whose only structural di erence is the substituent at C4, showed that the most e ective 47Appl. Sci. 2019 ,9, 2957 group at this position was a carboxylic acid ( 14), followed by hydroxyl ( 10) and aldehyde ( 12) groups, while a methyl group, as in 1, led to a loss of activity. B. cereus ,B. alvei ,B. megaterium, and B. pumilus showed similar behavior to B. subtilis (14vs.12); (b) Acetylation and methylation reduce activity, as revealed by comparison of potency of the natural compounds with their corresponding analogues ( 7vs. 24,8vs.25,9vs.26,10vs.11,16vs.17,18,19, and 20vs.21), at C6 ( 6vs.7). This indicates that the hydroxyl group, which could interact with the receptor as hydrogen-bond-donor (HBD), is the best functional group, suggesting that the hydrophilicity is relevant for the activity; (c) Compounds with an unconjugated double bond at C-7 showed considerable activity (e.g., 6and 24), and reduction at C-7 /C-8 results in a partial loss of antimicrobial 25and 26); (d) The -stereochemistry at increases two-fold the activity with respect to the H-8 ,a s shown by comparing the MIC values of 26and 25; (e) A substituent at C-7, in addition to the carbonyl at C-6, is also relevant for the activity, being a ketone preferred to a structural features for phenolic nor-triterpenes against the most sensitive microorganism, Bacillus subtilis . Furthermore, the results obtained against Staphylococcus spp. suggest that: (a) the presence of a carboxylic acid moiety at C-4 could strongly a ect the antimicrobial activity against S. aureus since its substitution by an aldehyde or a methyl group reduced or fully eliminated the activity ( 14vs.12 or1); (b) moreover, replacement of the carboxyl group at C-29 by its methyl ester led to a partial loss of activity ( 13vs.12); (c) compounds containing two carboxylic acid groups lacked activity, whereas those with one carboxylic acid showed high activity ( 14vs.15); (d) the reduction of the double bond at C-7/C-8 led to less activity ( 24vs.25and 26against S. epidermidis ); (e) the -stereochemistry at the C-8 position favored the activity with respect to the H-8 (26vs.25); (f) a hydroxyl group at C-6 a ected the activity against S. epidermidis (6vs.7). Taking into account these structural features, we propose a hypothetical compound, 4-carboxy-6 -hydroxy-pristimerol, that would have a zeylasterone A-ring (as in 14), an unconjugated B-ring (as in 6and 24), and a pristimerin E-ring as being the most active against Bacillus and Staphylococcus spp. (Figure 5). 48Appl. Sci. 2019 ,9, 2957 Figure 5. Structural requirements of phenolic nor-triterpenes based on SAR studies. Some phenolic compounds primarily target the cytoplasmic membrane due to their hydrophobic nature, and preferentially partition into the lipid bilayer [ 33], as was observed in our previous works [ 22-25]. Therefore, for the purpose of correlating the antimicrobial activity with lipophilicity, clog Pvalues [ 34] of this series of compounds were calculated, including that of the hypothetical compound, 4-carboxy-6 -hydroxy-pristimerol (clog P4.88), and are shown in Table 1. Slight increases in lipophilicity of respectively) (clog P7.18 and 6.90) led to a suppression of the antibacterial activity. Moreover, other factors must be taken into account for the expression of the activity, such as the presence of an hydrogen-bond donor (HBD) group, strategically positioned at C-4 (e.g., 14), C-6 (e.g., 6), or at C-2 and C-3 (e.g., 12 and 14) with clog Pof 5.04, 5.95, and 5.67, respectively, which seems relevant for the activity. These observations indicated that both lipophilicity and HBD factors are involved in the antimicrobial activity of this type of compound. 4. Conclusions In summary, the antimicrobial activity of ve phenolic nor-triterpenes isolated from two Maytenus species and those of four derivatives revealed that compound 6 showed signicant activity against Gram-positive bacteria, higher than cephotaxime, used as positive control. In order to understand and further optimize the structural requirements for e ective inhibition of bacterial growth in vitro , an extensive SAR analysis of a series of nor-triterpene phenols was performed. This study suggests that the phenolic moiety and carboxyl group at C-4 on the A-ring, a nonconjugated double bond system on theB-ring, and the ring E, characteristic of pristimerin series, all contribute to the antimicrobial e ectiveness. Based on these ndings, we propose a hypothetical lead compound, 4-carboxy-6 -hydroxy-pristimerol. This comprehensive SAR study supports the future rational design of antimicrobial agents based on the phenolic nor-triterpene sca old.

Oleracones, a novel series of flavonoids isolated from Portulaca oleracea L., possess potent antioxidative activities and are expected to exhibit therapeutic potential on the aging process. The current paper describes the concise sequential synthesis of oleracones D-F. Oleracones D and F were e ciently synthesized via selective intramolecular oxa-Michael addition from oleracone E. In addition, we investigated their possible lifespan-extension properties using Caenorhabditis elegans , which is excellently suited as an experimental model to study aging. A signicant longevity e ect was observed when nematodes were grown with 20 M synthesis 1. Introduction Aging is a complicated biological process that is controlled by a large number of genetic and environmental factors [ 1-4]. Many theories have been proposed to account for the aging process, but none of them oers a fully acceptable explanation. Among all the theories, the free radical theory of aging, proposed by professor Harman in 1956 [ 5], has been extensively investigated. This theory continues to be revised and remains a strong theory for the aging process until now. Free radical theory explains that aging is caused by cumulative oxidative stress from free radicals, resulting in cell death and, eventually, death of the organism [ 6]. Hence, this theory suggests that antioxidants that can sacricially scavenge ROS (reactive oxygen species) and /or RNS (reactive nitrogen species) are e ective for delaying the aging process. Indeed, early studies have indicated that plant-derived polyphenol antioxidants, including curcumin, quercetin, and resveratrol, show therapeutic potential for aging and aging-associated diseases [ 7,8]. In addition, other synthetic flavonoids have been continuously reported as novel antioxidants exhibiting antiaging properties [ 9-12]. Portulaca oleracea L. is a well-known annual weed, one that is widely distributed in temperate and tropical regions. This plant has been used for a long time, not only as an edible potherb, but also as a traditional medicine in many countries, being used to alleviate a wide range of illnesses [ 13]. In addition to phytochemical research, many pharmacological studies have been performed usingthe extracts or single compounds from Portulaca oleracea L. to reveal their therapeutic properties. Interestingly, the extracts of this plant are known to possess not only a strong in vivo antioxidant capacity, but also anti-aging activity in a d-galactose-induced mice model [ 14,15]. Sci. Recently, novel series of flavonoids, were isolated from Portulaca oleracea L. by Chinese researchers [ 16,17]. They reported the potent antioxidative potential of oleracones, which allowed us to speculate that oleracones may also possess anti-aging properties [ 16,17]. The current paper includes the concise sequential synthesis of oleracones and an evaluation of their possible lifespan-extension properties using Caenorhabditis elegans , an excellent experimental model to study aging. Among the reported oleracones, we planned to synthesize two homoisoflavones, oleracones D(1) and F ( 2), and a dihydrochalcone, E ( 3), which exhibit potent antioxidative e ects (Figure 1). Figure 1. The structures of oleracones D ( 1) ,F( 2), and E ( 3). 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Chemistry2.1.1. General Information Unless noted otherwise, all reactions were performed in dry solvents under anhydrous conditions and argon atmosphere. The reaction flasks were flame-dried before use, and all solvents for extraction and chromatography were reagent grade. All reagents were purchased from commercial suppliers and were used without further purication. TLC (thin-layer chromatography) was conducted for monitoring reaction progress with 0.25 mm silica gel plates (Merck, Kenilworth, NJ, USA). Silica gel 60 (230-400 mesh, Merck, Kenilworth, NJ, USA) was used for flash column chromatography with the indicated solvents.1H and13C spectra were recorded on a Brucker Analytik ADVANCE digital 500 (500 MHz) (Billerica, BRUKER AVANCE-800 (800 MHz) (Billerica, coupling constant in hertz (Hz), and number of protons. Chemical shifts are stated in ppm (parts per million, ) downeld from tetramethylsilane (CDCl 3and DMSO-d 6). IR (infrared) spectra were recorded on a FT-IR-4200 (JASCO, Tokyo, Japan) spectrometer. Low- and high-resolution mass spectra were acquired with JMS-700 (JEOL, Tokyo, Japan) equipment. 2.1.2. Experimental Section (E)-3-(2-(Benzyloxy)phenyl)-1-(2-hydroxy-4,6-dimethoxyphenyl)prop-2-en-1-one (6). To a solution of 4,6-dimethoxy-2-hydroxybenzophenone 4 (700 mg, 3.57 mmol) and 2-(benzyloxy)benzaldehyde 5 (1100 mg, 5.35 mmol) in ethyl alcohol (11 mL), KOH (400 mg, 7.14 mmol) was added at room temperature. After stirring at the same temperature for 48 h, the reaction mixture was concentrated in vacuo. The reaction mixture was quenched with 1 Naqueous solution of hydrochloric acid and extracted with EtOAc (ethyl acetate). The combined organic layer was washed with saturated sodium bicarbonate solution, dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate, and concentrated in vacuo. Purication of the concentrated residue by flash column chromatography (EtOAc /n-Hexane=1 : 40 to 1 : 10) aorded 1500 mg (75%) of chalcone 6 as a yellow 391.1545; observed 391.1541. Oleracone E . (3). To a of chalcone 6 (500 mg, 1.28 mmol) in ethyl alcohol (10 mL), catalytic amount of 5% activated palladium on carbon was added at room temperature. After stirring for 48 h under H 2atmosphere, the reaction mixture was ltered through a pad of Celite and concentrated in vacuo. Purication of the concentrated residue by flash column chromatography : n-Hexane=1 :1 0t o1:3 )aorded of oleracone E (3) as a yellowish powder. The spectral data of 3 were consistent with previous data (Table S1). was added to solution of oleracone E (3) (100 mg, 0.33 mmol) in toluene (5.5 mL) at room temperature. The reaction mixture was refluxed for 2 h, and then cooled to room temperature. The reaction mixture was concentrated in vacuo. Purication of the concentrated residue by flash column chromatography (EtOAc : n-Hexane=1 : 2) aorded 93 mg (90%) of oleracone F (2) as a yellow powder.

To a solution of oleracone F (2) (150 mg, 0.48 mmol) in methylene chloride (5 mL), CH 2Cl2, 1.92 mmol) was slowly added at 0C. After stirring for 1 h at the same temperature, the reaction mixture was quenched with H 2O, diluted with methylene chloride, stirred for an additional 1 h, and extracted with methylene chloride. The combined organic layer was washed with brine, dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate, and concentrated in vacuo. Purication of the concentrated residue by flash column chromatography (EtOAc : n-Hexane=1:5) aorded 114 mg (80%) of oleracone D (1) as a yellowish powder. The spectral data of 1 were consistent with previous data (Table S3). m.p.: 154-155C; R 2.2. Biology 2.2.1. C. elegans Maintenance In this paper, we used wild-type N2 nematodes which were acquired from the Caenorhabditis Genetic Center (CGC; University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, USA). All nematodes were nurtured 55Appl. Sci. 2019 ,9, 4014 at 20C on an NGM (Nematode Growth Medium) agar plate with Escherichia coli OP50 previously reported [ 18] 2.2.2. Lifespan Assay Lifespan assays were carried out under normal culture conditions. Age-synchronized nematodes were collected by embryo isolation and L1 arrest. The as-obtained L1 stage nematodes were grown on an NGM plate with or without of ( 1), (2), and ( 3). The survival rate of the test nematodes was determined using a dissecting microscope (SMZ1500, Nikon, Tokyo, Japan). Nematodes that failed to respond to prodding with the tip of a platinum wire were considered dead. Living nematodes were transferred to a fresh NGM plate every 2 days.2.2.3. Statistical Analysis The results obtained from the lifespan assay were plotted using Kaplan-Meier analysis, and the statistical signicance between each group was analyzed using the log-rank test. The mean lifespan data were presented as the mean \u00b1standard deviation. 3. Results and Discussion The retrosynthetic analysis for oleracones is outlined in Scheme 1. Homoisoflavone skeleton was anticipated to be e ciently prepared via a deoxybenzoin route, one of the most popular synthetic methods used for the preparation of isoflavonoids [ 19]. Therefore, homoisoflavone 2 and its O-demethylated analog 1were planned to be obtained from dihydrochalcone 3. Oleracone E(3) was anticipated to be prepared via an aldol condensation between commercially available 4,6-dimethoxy-2-hydroxybenzophenone 4and 2-(benzyloxy)benzaldehyde 5. Scheme 1. Retrosynthetic analysis of oleracones D ( 1) ,F( 2), and E ( 3). Our synthesis was commenced with an aldol condensation between commercially available 4,6-dimethoxy-2-hydroxybenzophenone 4and 2-(benzyloxy)benzaldehyde 5to give chalcone 6 (Scheme 2). Concurrent hydrogenolysis of the O-benzyl group in chalcone 6using 5% activated Pd on carbon under H 2atmosphere led to olereacone E ( 3) in 88% yield. We envisaged the construction of the homoisoflavone skeleton of 1and 2via a selective intramolecular oxa-Michael addition reaction of an enone moiety by the phenol group at the 2\"-position rather than the 2'-position of intermediate 6, resulting from condensation reaction between 3and a formyl reagent. According to our expectation, oleracone F ( 2) was obtained in high yield (90%) upon stirring with N,N-dimethylformamide dimethyl acetal [ 20] in toluene under reflux condition, and no regioisomeric by-products were observed. The high regioselectivity observed in the reaction was attributed to the enhanced nucleophilicity of the phenol group at the 2\"-position compared to that at the 2'-position in 3, which can be supported by the electron-withdrawing e ect of the carbonyl group. Finally, selective O-demethylation of 2using BCl 3aorded oleracone D ( 1) in spectral data obtained for oleracones D-F ( 1-3) were consistent with those previously reported data [ 16,17]. 56Appl. Sci. 2019 ,9, 4014 Scheme 2. Synthesis of oleracones D ( 1) ,F( 2), and E ( 3). With the oleracones D-F ( 1-3) in hand, we examined their e ects on the longevity of nematodes. To test whether oleracones exhibit lifespan-extension activity, we performed a lifespan assay using wild-type N2 nematodes at 20C, as described previously [ 21]. As shown in Figure 2A,B, all of the oleracones tested could prolong the lifespan of the nematodes under standard culture conditions, although the eectiveness of each compound was somewhat variable. At the maximum concentration studied (20M), treatment with 3and 2extended the lifespan of nematodes by 13.8 and 11.8%, respectively, compared with the control, while the e cacy of 1(4.3% extension) was inferior to that of2and 3. Interestingly, the longevity e ect of 1-3on nematodes did not show any correlation with their radical scavenging activities (IC 50values: 11.73, 13.17, and 17.78 M, respectively) [ 16,17]. These results suggest the possibility that modulating aging-related factors may also cooperate with the direct radical scavenging activity that produces the anti-aging e ect. However, detailed information on the underlying mechanism of the lifespan-extension properties of oleracone 1-3remains to be dened. 57Appl. Sci. 2019 ,9, The longevity eect of oleracone D-F ( 1-3).(A) The lifespan curves obtained for compound-treated (20 M) and untreated wild-type nematodes under normal culture conditions. (B) The change in lifespan observed for the compound-treated (20 M) nematodes when compared to the control. ( C) The mean lifespan of compound-treated (5, 10, and 20 M) and untreated wild-type nematodes was calculated from the survival curves. The statistical di erence between the curves was analyzed using a log-rank test. * p<0.05 compared with the vehicle alone. All experiments were repeated in triplicate. 4. Conclusions In summary, we concisely synthesized potent antioxidant homoisoflavones, oleracones D ( 1) a n dF( 2), from dihydrochalcone olereacone E ( 3), and investigated their potential lifespan extension properties. Our results may shed light on the development of isoflavone-based anti-aging medications.

Received: 16 April 2020; Accepted: 6 May 2020; Published: 10 May 2020 Featured Application: A quick, green, and simple ultrasound-assisted microextraction was here developed and validated for a quick and simple evaluation of total phenolic content from almond oil residues for their valorization as a source of antioxidant compounds. Abstract: Almond ( Prunus dulcis (Mill.) D.A. Webb) is one of the most important nut crops both in terms of area and production. Over the last few decades, an important part of the benecial actions for health associated with their consumption was attributed to the phenolic compounds, mainly accumulated in almond skin. Interestingly, after cold-pressed oil extraction, most of these antioxidant phenolic compounds are retained in a skin-enriched by-product, a so-called almond cold-pressed oil residue. In Morocco, the fth highest ranking producer in the world, this production generates an important part of this valuable byproduct. In the present study, using a multivariate Box-Behnken design, an ultrasound-assisted extraction method of phenolic compounds from Moroccan almond cold-pressed oil residue was developed and validated. Response surface methodology resulted in the optimal extraction conditions: the use of aqueous ethanol 53.0% ( v/v) as a green solvent, applying an ultrasound frequency of 27.0 kHz for an extraction duration of 29.4 min. The present ultrasound-assisted extraction allowed substantial gains in terms of extraction e ciency compared to conventional heat reflux extraction. Applied to three di erent local Beldi genotypes growing at three di erent experimental sites, the optimal conditions for ultrasound-assisted extraction led to a total phenolic content of 13.86 mg /g dry weight. HPLC analysis revealed that the main phenolic compounds from this valuable byproduct were: chlorogenic acid followed by protocatechuic acid, p-hydroxybenzoic acid, and p-coumaric acid. The accumulation of these phenolic compounds appeared to be more dependent on the genetic background than on the environmental impact here represented by the three experimental culture sites. Both in vitro cell free and cellular antioxidant assays were performed, and revealed the great Appl. ,10, 3313 ; doi:10.3390 /app10093313 www.mdpi.com /journal/applsci 61Appl. Sci. 2020 ,10, 3313 potential of these extracts. In particular, correlation analysis provided evidence of the prominent roles of chlorogenic acid, protocatechuic acid, and p-hydroxybenzoic acid. To summarize, the validated ultrasound-assisted extraction method presented here is a quick, green, simple and e cient for the possible valorization of antioxidant phenolic compounds from Moroccan almond cold-pressed oil residues, making it possible to generate extracts with attractive antioxidant activities for future nutraceutical and /or cosmetic extraction 1. Introduction Consumption of fruits, vegetables, nuts, and seeds has been associated with lower risks of chronic and degenerative diseases [ 1-4]. Particularly, given their many benecial e ects on human health, in recent decades, there has been growing interest in the consumption of nuts as a nutrient-rich food [ 3]. Produced and consumed worldwide, almond ( Prunus dulcis (Mill.) D.A.Webb) is one of the most popular nuts. It can be consumed in the form of whole nuts, flour, and beverages proposed in the food industry. A large part of almond health benets has been ascribed to their lipid prole [ 3,4]. Almond oil is also a sought-after and attractive component for many cosmetic formulations. Over the last few decades, the part of the benecial actions for health, but also of the growing interest for industrial applications, ascribed to almond phenolics have become increasing [ 3-5]. The high antioxidant capacity of almond phenolics make it an attractive alternative to synthetic antioxidants. Synthetic antioxidants were largely used to maintain the oxidative stability of emulsions and commonly used in food products and pharmaceutical and cosmetic preparations. However, synthetic antioxidants such as butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA) or butylated hydroxytoluene adverse health e ects, including carcinogenesis [ 6-8]. Therefore, the use of some of these synthetic antioxidants is now prohibited for food applications in Japan, Canada, and Europe, and they have been removed from what is generally recognized as a safe (GRAS) list. The replacement of these widely criticized synthetic molecules with natural molecules would meet the expectations of manufacturers and consumers. Therefore, it is now important to identify the natural antioxidants with a pronounced and safer radical scavenging capacity for consumers. Despite their distinct lipophilicity prole compared to BHA or BHT, some natural antioxidant phenolics have been shown to be as e ective as these synthetic antioxidants in stabilizing nonpolar systems such as bulk oil or di erent emulsion types [ 9-11], in good agreement with the prediction of polar paradox theory [ 12]. Interestingly, after cold-pressed oil extraction, most of the antioxidant phenolic compounds accumulated in the almond skin are retained in a skin-enriched by-product [ 3,5,13], making this almond cold-pressed oil residue (AOR) an attractive raw material for extraction and the valorization of these natural antioxidant phenolics. In Morocco, the fth highest ranking producer in the world, almond is the most important nut crop both in terms of area and production value. Several local genotypes, called Beldi , which means \"from here\" as opposed acclimatized genotypes called Romi (i.e., from elsewhere) [ 14], are of special interest [ 15]. The almond plantations cover a total area of 150,000 ha for an average annual production estimated at 100,000 tons of unshelled products, of which 9% of this area which provides up to 14% of the Moroccan almond production is located in Eastern Morocco (Figure 1)[15]. This production generates an important part of byproducts, in particular of cold pressed almond oil residues. To date, these by-products of almond oil have been used primarily for animal feed, as litter or for energy production. However, upgrading to higher value-added sectors would signicantly increase the revenue from this byproduct valuation. With an average growth rate of 5% per year since 2010 and a large prot margin, the cosmetics market is a dynamic industry. However, this sector is very competitive, with companies facing ever more restrictive environmental regulations (such as REACH in 62Appl. Sci. 2020 ,10, 3313 European Union), in addition to consumer pressures that push them to innovate and gradually shift to more natural products and green production methods. The functional properties of several oleaginous species of agro-waste, including their antioxidant activity, in relation to their high concentration in phenolic compounds, have been documented [ 9,13,16-27]. The application of the biorenery principle to the recovery of natural antioxidants from almond by-products as cosmetic active ingredients would therefore represent a good opportunity for the almond sector compared to their current use. Figure 1. Parts of almond fruits leading to cold-pressed almond oil and its residue (AOR) used as byproduct in the present study to extract phenolic compounds. For optimal valorization of these natural co-products, the development of e ective extraction methods is necessary. In the past, there were many methods developed for the extraction of natural antioxidants from various natural matrices based on conventional methods such as maceration or Soxhlet extraction. More recently, green extraction methods including microwave-assisted extraction or ultrasound-assisted extraction (USAE) have been found to be particularly e ective [ 11,21,28-30]. These green extraction technologies have also aroused great interest for industrial applications, and USAE is now considered as one of the most e cient energy saving processes in terms of duration, selectivity, and reproducibility, operating under mid-extraction conditions [ 28]. It is accepted that the improvement in extraction e ciency obtained using the USAE is based on both acoustic cavitation and mechanical eects [ 28]. Indeed, ultrasound (US) produces an acoustic cavitation e ect facilitating the penetration of the extraction solvent. Therefore, easier release of the intracellular contents of the plant material is observed through greater agitation of the solvent resulting in increased surface contact between the solvent and the target compound as well as increased solubility of the target compound in the solvent of extraction [ 28]. Here, we report on the development and validation of a USAE method for the extraction of antioxidant phenolic acids from an enriched skin fraction made up of cold pressed AOR from Bedli Moroccan genotypes produced in Eastern Morocco (Figure 1). Recently, Prgomet et al. [ 13] have also developed a method for comparing the polyphenol fractions from dierent almond byproducts including the skin using almond varieties from Portugal, but using a conventional heat reflux method. An USAE method was developed by Kahlaoui et al. [ 18] for the extraction of polyphenols from another almond byproduct: the hulls (the part surrounding the shell itself surrounded by the thin skin; Figure 1) from Italian and Tunisian varieties. It is thus of special interest to compare our method optimized using a di erent genotype, but more importantly either a green extraction method or a di erent (by)product. The optimal extraction conditions of this USAE using ethanol as a solvent were obtained through a multivariate technique (Behnken-Box design) coupled with response surface methodology (RSM) and then validated according to international 63Appl. Sci. 2020 ,10, 3313 standards of the association of analytical communities (AOAC). This USAE was applied to investigate the influence of the genetic and environment on the phenolic contents by considering three di erent local Beldi genotypes growing at three di erent experimental sites. Both in vitro cell free and cellular antioxidant assays were performed to evaluate the evolution of antioxidant activity of the corresponding extracts. Finally, correlations linking phytochemical prole and antioxidant activities of the extracts are presented. 2. Materials and Methods2.1. Chemicals and Reagents Extraction solvents (ethanol and water) used in the present study were of analytical grade (Thermo Scientic, Illkirch, France). Reagents for antioxidant assays as well (chlorogenic acid, p-coumaric acid, protocatechuic acid and p-hydroxybenzoic acid) were purchased from Merck (Saint-Quentin Fallavier, France). 2.2. Plant Materials and Culture Conditions AOR were obtained from Moroccan almonds (local ecotypes Beldi ) grown in 3 dierent using growing conditions as previously described by Melhaoui et al. [ 15]. Almonds were then triturated IBG Monforts Oekotec GmbH & Co. KG, Monchengladbach, Germany) and the residues were ground to ca. 100-150 m particles using a blender equipped with rotating blades (Grindomix GM 200 blender, Retsch France, Eragny, France) used as raw materials for USAE optimization. 2.3. Ultrasound-Assisted Extraction Method Development USAE was completed with an ultrasonic bath (USC1200TH, Prolabo, Sion, Switzerland) composed of a 300\u00d7240\u00d7200 mm (inner dimension) tank, with electric power of 400 W corresponding to an acoustic power of 1 W /cm2and maximal heating power of 400 W. The variable frequencies of this device can be selected thanks to a frequency controller, and it also has a temperature regulator as well as an automatic digital timer. Each sample was placed in 50 mL quartz tubes equipped with a vapor condenser, and was suspended in 10 mL extraction solvent. A liquid to solid ratio of 10:1 mL /gD W (dry weight) was used and extraction was performed at 45C. For Extraction optimization a Box-Behnken design was used and the resulting response surface plots drawn with the help of XLSTAT2019 software (Addinsoft, Paris, France). For this purpose, three variables (aqueous Ethanol (aqEtOH) concentration (X 1), US frequency (X 2), and extraction duration (X 3)) were studied and coded at three levels ( 1, 0 and+1) as described in Table 1: Table 1. Identity, code unit, coded levels, and actual experimental values of each variable used for USAE of TPC from almond oil residues.

Sci. 2020 ,10, 3313 (Table 2). The experiments were carried out in triplicate. Equation of the model for the extraction of total phenolics from almond oil residues was calculated using the XLSTAT 2019 DOE analysis tool (Addinsoft, Paris, France). The corresponding response surface plots were obtained with 3D option of XLSTAT 2019 (Addinsoft, Paris, France). Table 2. Results of Box-Behnken experimental design of USAE of TPC from AOR.

Determination of T otal Phenolic Content After extraction, each extract was centrifuged for 15 min at 5000 \u00d7g(Heraeus Biofuge Stratos, Thermo Scientic, Illkirch, a syringe lter (0.45 m, Merck Millipore, Molsheim, France) prior to analysis. The total phenolic content (TPC) was determined spectrophotometrically using the Folin-Ciocalteu reagent (Merck, Saint-Quentin Fallavier, France) and according to the protocol adapted for a microplate reader described by Abbasi et al. [ 31]. Briefly, 10 L of extract were homogenized with 180 Lo fa mixture composed of 4% ( 25C, of the Folin-Ciocalteu reagent were added, and the homogenized mixture was incubated for 30 min at 25C. Absorbance was measured Absorbance g/mL; R2=0.998) of gallic acid (Merck, Saint-Quentin Fallavier, France) was used to express the TPC in mg of gallic acid equivalents per g DW (mg GAE /g DW). 2.5. Validation Parameters Method validation was carried out using the recommendations of the association of analytical communities (AOAC) in terms of precision, repeatability, and recovery as described in detail in Corbin et al. [ 21]. For HPLC, 6-point calibration lines were obtained by means of diluted solutions of each authentic commercial standard (Merck, Saint-Quentin Fallavier, France). Each sample was injected three times, and arithmetic means were calculated to generate linear regression equations plotting was done by the peak areas (y) against the injected quantities (x) of each standard. Coe cients of determination ( R2) were used for linearity verication. The limits of detection (LOD) and of quantication (LOQ) was calculated using signal-to-noise ratios of 3:1 and 10:1, respectively. 65Appl. Sci. 2020 ,10, 3313 2.6. HPLC Analysis After extraction, each extract was centrifuged for 15 min at 3000 rpm and the resulting supernatant ltered using a syringe lter (0.45 m, Millipore, Molsheim, France) prior to analysis. Separation and identication of the main extract constituents was done by HPLC with a Varian system (Varian, Les Ulis, France) composed Prostar autosampler, Array Detector (PAD) and driven by Galaxie version 1.9.3.2 software (Varian, Les Ulis, France). A Purospher RP-18 column (250 \u00d74.0 mm internal diameter; 5 m) (Merck Chemicals, Molsheim, France) was used for the separation performed at a temperature set at 35C. The mobile phase was a mixture of: (i) A, which was acidied HPLC grade water with acetic acid (0.2% ( v/v)), and (ii) B, which was HPLC grade methanol. During the separation run, the mobile phase composition varied according to a nonlinear gradient as follows: 8% B (0 min), 12% B (11 min), 30% B (17 min), 33% B (28 min), 100% B (30-35 min), and 8% B (36 min) at a flow rate of 1 mL /min. Between each injection, a 10-min re-equilibration time was applied. The detection of compounds was set at 295 and 325 nm (corresponding to the max of the main compounds). Quantication was done based on assessment of retention times of commercial standards (Merck, Saint-Quentin Fallavier, France). 2.7. Antioxidant Activities2.7.1. In Vitro Cell Free DPPH Free Radical Scavenging Assay The in vitro cell free DPPH (2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl) assay was used to evaluate the free radical scavenging activity of the samples as described by the microplate protocol of Shah et al. [ 32]. 2.7.2. In Vitro Cell Free ABTS Antioxidant In Vitro Cell Free Assay ABTS (2,2-azinobis(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulphonic acid)) in vitro cell free antioxidant activity of each extract was determined as described by Ullah et al. [ 33]. 2.7.3. Cupric Ion Reducing (CUPRAC) In Vitro Free Assay CUPRAC assay was performed in a microplate as described by Drouet et al. [ 8]. 2.7.4. Determination of using yeast cells, based on the measurement of membrane lipid peroxide, was carried out with the thiobarbituric acid (TBA; Merck, Saint-Quentin Fallavier, France) method as described by Garros et al. [ 34]. 2.8. Statistical Analysis Means and standard deviations of three to ve independent replicates were used to present the data. Model analysis (ANOVA) and 3D plots resulting from the combination of variables were performed using XLSTAT 2019 and R analysis following the manufacturer's instructions (Addinsoft, Paris, France). A Student's t-test was performed for comparative statistical analysis of the impact of the dierent cultivation sites (XLSTAT 2019, Addinsoft, Paris, France). Correlation analysis was performed with Past 3.0 (\u00d8yvind Hammer, Natural History Museum, University of Oslo, Oslo, Norway) using the Pearson parametric correlation test and visualized using Heatmapper [ 35]. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was performed with Past 3.0 (\u00d8yvind Hammer, Natural History Museum, University of Oslo, Oslo, Norway). Signicant thresholds at p<0.05 or p<0.05,<0.01 and<0.001 were used for all statistical tests and represented by di erent letters or by *, ** and ***, respectively. 66Appl. Sci. 2020 ,10, 3313 3. Results and Discussion 3.1. Development of the Ultrasound-Assisted Extraction Using Box-Behnken Design Multivariate techniques are used very e ectively to optimize the extraction method from complex plant matrices such as food products and by-products [ 36]. Among the dierent multivariate techniques, when three factors are considered, the Behnken-Box design is one of the most e ective techniques [ 36,37]. The Behnken-Box matrix is a spherical and rotating design, which, viewed on a cube, consists of the central point and the middle of the edges [ 36,37]. Many parameters can influence the extraction of phenolic compounds from plant matrices [ 38], but three parameters are very widely distinguished when developing an USAE method: the type of solvent used, the frequency of ultrasound applied and the extraction time [ 11,21,30]. The choice of solvent is a crucial parameter to dene when developing an extraction method. Various solvents, including methanol, ethanol, or acetone, are regularly used for the extraction of plant polyphenols [ 28,39]. Here, given our objective of developing an extraction method in accordance with green chemistry principles for future nutraceutical and /or cosmeceutical applications of the resulting extract, EtOH was considered as an extraction solvent. First, EtOH is one of the less toxic solvents for humans and more respectful of the environment than other organic solvents such as methanol for example [ 38,40]. In addition, its extraction capacity can easily be modulated by addition of water, making it an ideal solvent for the extraction of a wide range of variable polarity polyphenols. Finally, these two universal solvents (i.e., EtOH and water) are already widely used for various food and /or cosmetic applications [ 11,28,30,38,40]. US frequency is a crucial parameter to consider because of its signicant impact on the extraction eciency. Indeed, this parameter modulates the cavitation e ect as well as the di usion coecient of the target compound in the extraction solvent. Consequently, it improves the solubilization of the compound in the extraction solvent, thus increasing the extraction e ciency [ 28]. In addition, increasing US frequency can also lead to a drastic reduction in extraction time, thereby reducing energy consumption, which is in accordance with the green chemistry principles [ 41]. However, depending on the compound and the plant matrix subjected to the extraction, application of high US frequency can alter the native structure of the compound, which not only decreases the extraction yield, but also considerably reduces its biological activity, thus negating any valuation interest [ 30]. Therefore, during the development of an USAE method, US frequency must be optimized very carefully depending on the compound, and the plant matrix subjected to the extraction. Finally, regarding the extraction time, it is important to consider that its increase does not necessarily lead to any improvement in extraction yield, since, contrarily, a prolonged exposure to US can lead to the increased degradation of the compound [ 30]. In addition, in order to reduce the impact of energy consumption in the green chemistry context, optimizing the extraction time also appears to be essential [ 41]. Having these considerations in mind, in order to develop a rapid, green and e cient USAE of TPC for the valorization of AOR, we therefore considered a Behnken-Box matrix with the following three parameters: aqEtOH concentration (X 1), ultrasound (US) frequency (X 2), and extraction duration (X3) as described in Table 1. Table 2presents the experimental and predicted TPC obtained from almond oil residues for the 18 dierent observations (run ID) corresponding the di erent USAE conditions of the Behnken-Box matrix having been determined randomly (run order) after an in silico -assisted procedure generated by the XL-Stat2019.4.1 software. Here, the from AOR ranged from: 5.03 mg /g DW (Obs3; obtained after 30 min extraction in water bath (no US application) using pure water as extraction solvent) to 11.44 mg /gD W (Obs16; obtained after 30 min at an ultrasonic bath running at a US frequency of 22.5 kHz using 50% (v/v) aqEtOH as extraction solvent) (Table 2). These results provide a rst indication on the interest of using an ultrasound and on the choice of an extraction solvent. We noted a good repeatability of the 67Appl. Sci. 2020 ,10, 3313 central point (i.e., Obs4, 5, 9, 11, 16, and 18), with a mean TPC of 11.37 \u00b10.05 mg/g DW corresponding to a relative standard deviation (RSD) of 0.47%, thus highlighting the high reliability of these results. Given the nature of the starting material used in the present study, this range of TPC is in fairly good agreement with the data in the literature obtained with almond and /or almond by-products from California, Portugal, Italia, and Tunisia [ 3,5,18,42]. A multiple regression analysis was applied to the model of the TPC as a function of the three dierent extraction variables. Under the described conditions, the TPC (Y TPC,i nm g/g DW) as a function of the three di erent extraction variables (Table 1) in the form of a polynomial equation was (Table of regression coe cients of USAE of TPC from ** signicant p<0.01. The statistical analysis of the regression coe cients conrmed the relevance of our choice in the extraction variables and their respective levels for the development of the present USAE method if we refer to the level of signicance with which these variables influenced the extraction (Table 3). The linear coecients X 1(aqEtOH concentration) and X 2(extraction time) were statistically highly signicant at p<0.001, with an X 1coecient being negative (high EtOH concentration reduced TPC) and X 2being positive (application of US treatment had a positive e ect on TPC). An extraction duration (X3) coecient was also signicant at p<0.01, but with a coe cient value close to zero indicating that a prolonged extraction period can lead to poorer extraction yield as a consequence of degradation as described in the literature [ 30,41,43]. All the quadratic and interaction coe cients were statistically highly signicant at p<0.001, but their values negative or close to zero indicated a negative or a lower impact to the extraction e cient. The results of the analysis of variance (ANOVA) and model tting are presented in Table 4. An elevated F-value (567.558) and low p-value ( p<0.0001) indicated the statistically highly signicance of the model that could predict TPC as a function of the variable values with a great precision. The low non-signicant value obtained for the lack of t conrmed this trend. The value for the determination coecient ( R2=0.997 (with adjusted value of 0.998) for the model as well as the coe cient value (CV=0.976) indicated the precision of the model as well as the adequacy between the model and experimental values, respectively. The model precision in the prediction of the TPC is further depicted by the predicted vs. experimental TPC plot presented in Figure S1. To better understand the complexity of the model, 3D plots representing TPC as a function of the extraction parameters were drawn (Figure 1). The calculated, but small, values of the linear coe cients of the second-order polynomial equation for X 2(US frequency) and X 3(extraction duration), as well as their interaction coe cient X 2X3 (US frequency x duration) indicate that a controlled increase of these parameters will have a global favorable consequences for the TPC extracted from AOR. However, their small values, in association 68Appl. Sci. 2020 ,10, 3313 with the negative values calculated for their quadratic coe cients (X 22and X 32, respectively), but also of all the coecient involving aqEtOH concentration (i.e., linear coe cient X 1, quadratic coecient X 12, and the interaction coe cients X 1X2and X 1X3), indicate that the TPC extracted from AOR according to these extraction parameters will reach a maximum value before decreasing for high values of these parameters. These considerations were clearly observed on the 3D plots (Figure 2). For each 3D plot, a rst tendency was observed with a higher TPC extracted from AOR with increased aqEtOH concentration, application of US as well as prolonged extraction time. However, after reaching a maximal value for TPC extracted from AOR, a further increase in the aqEtOH concentrations as well as application of higher US frequency and /or prolonged extraction duration resulted in a pronounced drop of the TPC (Figure 2).

Predicted surface response plots of the TPC extraction yield (in mg /g DW) as a function of aqEtOH concentration and US frequency, aqEtOH concentration and extraction duration, as well as US frequency and extraction duration. In various concentrations in mixture with water, aqEtOH solutions have been widely used as eco-friendly solvents to extract a wide range of polyphenols from plant matrices [ 11,21,30,38,40] including various almond products [ 13,18,44]. However, to obtain optimal results, the concentration of aqEtOH must be adapted because it is very dependent on the polyphenolic compound(s) as well as on the plant matrix considered [ 28,38,40]. Alongside, it is clearly established that, during USAE, high US frequency associated with extended extraction duration could reveal destructive through the induction of polyphenols oxidation, in particular in the presence of water [ 21,28,30]. Consequently, if these parameters are not nely controlled (optimized), this can lead to a sharp reduction in the extraction yield, quantitatively but also qualitatively with a drastic decay observed in the biological interest of the sample extract [ 11,29,30]. Using the Box-Behnken matrix for optimizing these parameters and using the resulting adjusted second order polynomial equation, optimal conditions for the extraction of phenolics from our were: 53.0% ( v/v) aqEtOH as solvent, 27.0 kHz for the US frequency and an extraction duration of 29.4 min. Using these optimal conditions resulted in a TPC 69Appl. Sci. 2020 ,10, 3313 of11.63\u00b10.15 mg/gD W (Figure 2). The optimal aqEtOH concentration obtained here is in line with results obtained for almond phenolics extraction very recently described [ 13,18]), although the starting byproduct material or the extraction method used were di erent from our study. The present method was then validated in respect with the AOAC standards. According to these standards, the parameter values of this validation procedure were adequate in terms of interday and intraday precision, but also repeatability and stability (Table 5). Indeed, the RSDs of both intraday and interday precisions were of 0.05 and 0.28%, respectively. The RSDs of the repeatability corresponding to ve dierent extraction repeats of ve samples from the same batch was of 1.30%. The recovery rates at three dierent addition levels of chlorogenic acid in the sample before extraction were between 100.26 and 101.13% reflect the accuracy of the present method. Table 5.

The eciency of the present USAE method was compared with conventional heat reflux extraction (HRE) using the same conditions, in particular an aqEtOH concentration (53.0% ( v/v) and an extraction time of 29.4 min. The di erence between USAE and HRE being the application of an US frequency of 27 kHz for the present optimized UASE extraction procedure, while no US was applied for the HRE protocol operating in a classical water bath. The comparison of these extractions is depicted in Figure 2. A signicant gain of 30% in TPC extracted from AOR was observed with the optimized USAE mg/g DW) (Figure 3). Increasing the extraction time for the HRE to one hour did not achieve performance levels similar to those obtained with USAE (9.24 \u00b10.37 mg/g DW). Consequently, it appears that the USAE method developed in the present study is of real interest according to the principles of green chemistry [ 45], not only in terms of the use of a renewable green solvent, but also in terms of reducing the energy consumption. We hypothesize that this e ciency could be partly explained by the hot spot hypothesis indicating that the cavitation bubbles, after their collapse, act as a microreactor locally generating, in the surrounding solvent, a high temperature environment and pressure leading to more e cient rupture of the plant matrix subjected to extraction and increased release as well as solubilization of phenolic compounds [ 28]. 02468101214 AOR using the optimal USAE (with US) conditions and comparison with conventional heat reflux method (HRE; without US).

Application to the Analysis of Samples from Di erent Cultivation Sites The present USAE was then applied to the quantication of phenolics in samples from three dierent local Beldi genotypes cultivated at three di erent locations in Eastern Morocco. In addition to the TPC, the concentration in protocatechuic acid, p-hydroxybenzoic acid, chlorogenic acid, and p-coumaric acid, reported as the main phenolic acids possibly accumulated in almond by-products [ 3,5,13,18,42,44,46], were also determined by HPLC after comparison with authentic commercial standards. Figure 4a shows a typical HPLC chromatogram, recorded at 325 nm, of the AOR extract obtained after USAE and showing the sepration of these four important phenolic acids: protocatechuic acid (1), p-hydroxybenzoic acid (2), chlorogenic acid (3), and p-coumaric acid (4) (Figure 4b).

The LODs ranged from 0.12 to 0.22 mg /mL, and LOQ from 0.38 to 0.73 mg /mL, for protocatechuic acid and chlorogenic acid, respectively (Table 6). 71Appl. Sci. 2020 ,10, 3313 Table 6. Quantication parameters of the HPLC method used to quantity protocatechuic acid, p-hydroxybenzoic acid, chlorogenic acid, and p-hydroxybenzoic acid, chlorogenic acid and p-coumaric acid in AOR resulting from samples of three di erent native Beldi genotypes (#1 to #3) cultivated at three di erent pilot locations in the Eastern Morocco (Sidi Bouhria (SID); Ain Sfa (AIN); Rislane (RIS)), the results are presented in Table 7. Table 7. Variations in TPC, and protocatechuic acid, p-hydroxybenzoic acid, chlorogenic acid and p-coumaric acid contents in AOR from samples of three di erent native Beldi genotypes produced at three dierent pilot locations in the Eastern Morocco. Sample IDTPC genotypes (#1 to #3) cultivated at three of three independent replicates. Di erent letters represent signicant di erences between the various extraction conditions ( ranged from 8.87 to 13.86 and respectively; from genotype #3 cultivated 56.25% richer in TPC than genotype #1 cultivated at the same location. The four quantied phenolic acids occurred for approximately 80% of the TPC. In decreasing contents: (1) chlorogenic acid was the main phenolic accumulated in the sample extracts with contents ranging from 5.29 \u00b10.12 to 8.14\u00b10.10 mg/g DW for extracts from samples AIN#1 and AIN#3, respectively (sample from genotype #3 cultivated at Ain Sfa being 53.87% richer in chlorogenic acid than genotype #1 cultivated at the same location); (2) protocatechuic acid content ranged from 1.29\u00b10.06 to 2.03\u00b10.07 mg/g DW for extracts from samples AIN#1 and AIN#3, respectively (sample from genotype #3 cultivated at Ain Sfa being 57.36% richer in protocatechuic acid than genotype #1 cultivated at the same location, corresponding to the highest observed variation range); (3)p-hydroxybenzoic acid content ranged from 0.75 \u00b10.03 to 1.13\u00b10.02 mg/g DW for extracts from samples AIN#1 and RIS#1 for the lowest content vs. sample AIN#3 for the highest content (sample from genotype #3 cultivated at Ain Sfa being 50.60% richer in p-hydroxybenzoic acid than genotype #1 cultivated both at Ain Sfa and Rislane); (4) acid content ranged from 0.21 \u00b10.04 to 0.30\u00b10.02 mg/gD W for extracts from samples AIN#1 and AIN#3, respectively (sample from genotype #3 cultivated at being 42.85% richer in p-coumaric acid than genotype #1 cultivated at Ain Sfa, corresponding to the lowest observed variation range). The concentrations determined here for each phenolic compound were in the range of variations observed by Kahlaoui et al. [ 18] for dierent varieties of almond byproducts from Italia and Tunisia. Extraction of phenolic compounds from a variety of oilcakes such as hemp, canola, linseed, black cumin, sesame, fennel, sunflower, rapeseed, camelina, or milk thistle has been reported [ 9,11,16,17,20-22,24-27]. The TPC obtained from AOR using the present USAE method is at the top of the range compared to these other sources. Chlorogenic 72Appl. Sci. 2020 ,10, 3313 acid content has been reported to be high in sunflower oilcakes where its presence is problematic for the valorization of its derived protein meal by-product [ 26]. The other phenolic acids from AOR have been extracted from various oilcakes, such as flax, canola, and black cumin seedcakes for p-coumaric acid [ 9,20,21,24], black cumin, and camelina for p-hydroxybenzoic acid [ 9], while protocatechuic acid and p-hydroxybenzoic acid have been reported in camelina by-products [ 25]. Note that other types of phenolics such as lignans and or flavonoids in flax, sesame, and milk thistle seedcakes have been reported [ 16,21-24]. Interestingly, synergistic interactions between phenolic compounds could occur at concentrations found in nature for antioxidant activity [ 47]. Antagonism have been also described [ 47]. Therefore, the dierent compositions, but also the concentrations observed in di erent oilseed cakes, could result in dierent synergistic and /or antagonistic interactions towards their antioxidant capacity. This hypothesis is going to deserve future studies. However, it is also important to consider that these concentrations are subject to change as a result of both genetic and environmental influences as observed in milk thistle, flax, sesame, but also in some almond cultivars [ 34,48,49]. Indeed, it is generally accepted that the genetic background, but also the environmental conditions, such as the location (i.e., soil conditions) or the climate, could have a great influence on the accumulation of phenolic compounds [ 3,18,34,42,46,50]. The present preliminary results obtained from three native genotypes cultivated on the same year at three di erent location sites from Eastern Morocco suggested a prominent influence of genetic over environment, since the impact of the genotype was more important than the influence of the cultivation site. Indeed, for each considered cultivation sites, the genotype #1 accumulated more phenolic compounds than the genotype #3, whereas both the highest and the lowest accumulation were observed on the same location (i.e., Ain Sfa experimental site). Analyses of the variance (ANOVA) conrmed this absence of any signicant influence of the cultivation site.Future works will be conducted with more genotypes as well as more experimental sites overseveral cultivation years to conrm or inrm this trend. However, the prominent influence of genetic background on the accumulation of phenolic compounds in almonds was reported by several authors [ 3,18,42,46], whereas the influence of environmental conditions on the same genotype was less studied. Bolling et al. [ 42] reported that the cultivation season influenced less polyphenolic accumulation than the genotype. The influence of cultivation site of the same genotype will deserve further works. An improvement in the quantity of phenolic compounds produced in the future may also be envisaged, in the future, by combining this USAE with base or acid hydrolysis to release the wall-bound phenolics or extract further antioxidant compounds from lignin. A gain of 30% in chlorogenic acid content was reported in sunflower seed cakes after the release of wall-bound phenolics. Nonetheless, it has been stated that coupling US to base and /or acid extraction is highly destructive for some forms of phenolic compounds [ 22]. The use of cell wall degrading enzymes such as cellulase could be an alternative to destructive chemical hydrolysis [ 24]. USAE coupled with cellulase hydrolysis of phenolic compounds have been already reported [ 51]. Future works will be dedicated to exploring this possibility. 3.3. Determination of the Antioxidant Potential of the Extracts and Correlation Analysis Our next goal was to ensure that the potential biological activities is retained during the USAE procedure. For this, we then determined the antioxidant potential of these nine characterized sample extracts from AOR by using both (1) in vitro cell free assays based on the chemistry of the antioxidant reaction with di erent mechanisms\u2014either proton transfer or electron transfer based assays, as well as (2) in cellulo using eukaryotic yeast cells subjected to oxidative stress induced by UV either in the presence and absence of the extracts to have an idea of their cellular antioxidant potential. Indeed, if they were preserved, this antioxidant biological activity would be of such a nature as to be of interest for both future nutraceutical and /or cosmetic applications of these AOR extracts. The protective antioxidant action developed by plant extracts can be influenced by many internal and external factors impacting their phytochemical compositions such as genetics (the use 73Appl. Sci. 2020 ,10, 3313 of dierent genotypes in our case) but also the environment (the use of di erent culture sites in our case) [ 3,18,34,42,46,50]. Furthermore, their antioxidant activity is generally based on complex mechanisms, which, in order to shorten, depending on the nature of the compounds present in the extract, can be based in particular on radical scavenging mechanisms. Here, to get an idea relating both to the antioxidant capacity but also to explore the possible mechanisms involved depending on the composition of the extract, we used three di erent in vitro cell-free assays: the DPPH, ABTS, and CUPRAC assays. These tests are based on di erent reaction mechanisms and could provide us a raw idea of the chemistry involved in the radical scavenging activity of the extract. Based on the chemical reaction involved, these in vitro cell free antioxidant assays can be roughly divided into dierent categories, with an ABTS assay based on a hydrogen atom transfer reaction (HAT), a CUPRAC assay based on an electron transfer reaction (ET), and the DPPH assay being considered as a mixed assay [ 52,53]. The results of these antioxidant assays expressed in M of Trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity (TEAC) per gram DW for the nine extracts obtained after USAE of AOR are presented in Table 8. Table 8. Variations in in vitro cell free (ABTS, DPPH and CUPRAC) and cellular (TBARS) antioxidant potential of extracts obtained from USAE of AOR from three di erent native Beldi genotypes produced at three dierent pilot locations in Eastern Morocco. Sample IDABTS (M erent native Beldi genotypes (#1 to #3) cultivated at three Morocco: Sidi Bouhria Sfa (AIN); 3 independent replicates. Di erent letters represent signicant dierences between the various conditions using a DPPH assay. For two in vitro cell free antioxidant assays, the AOR extract from the genotype #3 produced at Ain Sfa showed the highest antioxidant capacity, whereas the extract obtained from the genotype #1 produced at thesame location displayed the lowest antioxidant values. On the contrary, results for CUPRAC assay, ranging from 129.69 this produced at Ain Sfa possessed the highest antioxidant capacity as compared to the genotype #3 from Sidi Bouhria. Although interesting from a strictly predictive point of view based on chemical reactions, these in vitro tests do not necessarily have a great similarity with in vivo systems. The validity of these antioxidant data must therefore be considered as limited to an interpretation within the meaning of the chemical reactivity with respect to the considered radicals generated in vitro , and have to be conrmed in vivo. In order to have an improved understanding and better reflect the in vivo situation, the antioxidant activity of these nine extracts has also been studied further for their capacity to inhibit the lipid peroxidation membrane generated by oxidative stress induced by UV-C in yeast cells. Yeast cells represent an excellent model for assessing antioxidant capacity in vivo in the context of cellular oxidative stress [ 54]. It is indeed an attractive and reliable eukaryotic model, whose defense and adaptation mechanisms to oxidative stress are well known and can be extrapolated to human cells presenting mechanisms certainly more complex but well conserved with this model [ 55,56]. Here, measured in vivo 3313 vivo antioxidant evaluation assay conrmed the trend observed with HAT-based in vitro assay, and conrmed that the AOR extract from the genotype #3 produced at Ain Sfa showed the highest antioxidant capacity, particularly as compared to extracts obtained from the genotype #1 produced at the same location. As shown in Figure 5, higher antioxidant capacity measured with HAT-based antioxidant assay appeared systematically associated with a higher accumulation of phenolics, whereas association with the ET-based antioxidant assay (i.e., CUPRAC) appeared more complex and not directly linked to the accumulation of theses phenolics (Figure 5a). Figure 5. (a) hierarchical clustering analysis (HCA) showing the relation between the phytochemical composition and antioxidant activity of each extracts from AOR of Eastern Morocco obtained by USAE; (b) principal component analysis (PCA) showing the discrimination of the di erent extracts from AOR of Eastern Morocco obtained by USAE. Principal component analysis was performed to further discriminate these nine samples (Figure 5b). The resulting biplot representation accounts for 92.64% (F1 +F2) of the initial variability of the data as shown in Figure 4b. The discrimination occurs mainly in the rst dimension (PC1) which explains 85.76% of the initial variability. The loading plots (F) conrmed the strong link between phytochemical composition, in particular the presence of the phenolics, and the HAT-based as well as cellular antioxidant capacity. In order to link the antioxidant capacity to the presence of a particular phytochemical, a Pearson correlation analysis was applied (Figure 6). This analysis provided evidence of the strong and highly signicant correlation between both HAT-based in vitro assays as well as cellular antioxidant assay and TPC of the extract, in particular with the presence of chlorogenic acid, protocatechuic acid, and p-hydroxybenzoic acid (Figure 6, Table S1). The presence of p-coumaric acid was signicantly correlated with a DPPH assay only. On the contrary, none of these phytochemicals, here analyzed, were signicantly correlated with the in antioxidant CUPRAC assay. 75Appl. Sci. 2020 ,10, 3313 Figure 6. Pearson correlation analysis (PCC) of the relation between the main phytochemicals (protocatechuic acid, p-hydroxybenzoic acid, chlorogenic acid and p-coumaric acid) from AOR extracts signicant p<0.05; actual PCC values are indicated in Supplementary Materials Table S1. Altogether, these results showed a higher antioxidant activity, expressed in M TEAC/gD W , determined with the ABTS and DPPH assays as compared to the CUPRAC assay. Therefore, these results suggested the prominence of the HAT- over the ET-based mechanism for the antioxidant action of these extracts. In good agreement, several authors have reported an antioxidant activity of extracts from various almond products based on HAT mechanism [ 18,42,44,46]. Similarly, a higher relation between HAT assay and phenolic acids as compared to flavonoids have been previously reported [ 52,57]. This observation is also in line with the results of Liang and Kitts [ 58] that reported a relatively stronger scavenging capacity of radicals generated by the ABTS and DPPH assays for chlorogenic acid, the main phenolic acid of our AOR extracts, and its derivatives. The authors attributed this observation to the available hydroxyl groups of these compounds. The presence of flavonoids has been also reported in almond products [ 13,18,42,44,46]. Here, we cannot exclude the presence of flavonoids potentially linked to the ET-based antioxidant activity evidenced by the CUPRAC assay. Prgomet et al. [ 13]) have reported in the presence of flavonoids in almond skin (i.e., isorhamnetin derivatives). Future works will be conducted to study in detail the flavonoid fraction of our AOR extracts. The cellular antioxidant assay using yeast further conrmed the interest of this system to study natural antioxidant from plant extracts [ 34,52] as also previously reported for other natural antioxidants such as thiamine and/or melatonin [ 55,56]. Natural antioxidants have aroused increasing interest over the past decade due to their possible use as an alternative to potentially dangerous synthetic antioxidants such as butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA) or butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT) in various food or cosmetic formulations [ 6-8]. Some natural antioxidant phenolics have already been shown to be as e cient in stabilizing nonpolar systems such as bulk oil or various types of emulsions as these synthetic antioxidants [ 7,9-11]. These preliminary results indicate a potential use as natural antioxidants of our AOR extracts generated by the present validated USAE. 4. Conclusions P.dulcis or the so-called almond is a rich source of antioxidant phenolic compounds that are retained, after almond cold-pressed oil extraction, in a skin-enriched by-product which, thus, represent an attractive starting material for their extraction. As natural antioxidants, these phenolic compounds' almond attracted much attention as alternatives to synthetic antioxidants in foods, pharmaceutical, and cosmetic preparations. Here, using a multivariate Box-Behnken design coupled with surface response methodology, we proposed an optimized and validated USAE of these phenolic compounds 3313 green solvent, US frequency 27.0 kHz and extraction duration 29.4 min. Following its optimization, the present USAE method was validated according to international standards to ensure its precision and accuracy in the quantitation of total phenolic content. The e ciency of the present USAE has allowed substantial gains in terms of extraction e ciency compared to conventional heat reflux extraction\u2014in particular by a strong reduction in extraction time, which is of particular interest in the context of green chemistry in terms of reduction of energy consumption, together with the use of a green extraction solvent. The application of this method already makes it possible to suggest a higher impact of thegenetic background than of the environment on three genotypes cultivated on three experimentalsites. This method therefore opens the door to more complete studies on this subject. Finally, both in vitro cell free and cellular antioxidant assays revealed the great potential of valorization of these extracts as a source of natural antioxidants. To summarize, the present extraction method allows a quick, green, simple, and e cient validated USAE for the possible valorization of antioxidant phenolic compounds from Moroccan almond cold-pressed oil residues, making it possible to generate extracts with attractive antioxidant activities for future nutraceutical and /or cosmetic applications.

The aim of the present study was to simultaneously analyze compounds of Salviae miltiorrhizae Radix (SMR) and determine their cytotoxic e ects on HCT-116 human colorectal cancer cells. We established a simultaneous analysis method of ve compounds (salvianic acid A, salvianolic acid B, ca eic acid, tanshinone IIA, and rosmarinic acid) contained in SMR, and found that among the various compounds in SMR, tanshinone IIA signicantly decreased cell viability in a concentration-dependent manner. Hoechst staining also showed that both SMR and tanshinone IIA increased nuclear condensation, suggesting induction of apoptosis. By Western blotting, we found that tanshinone IIA induced apoptotic cell death, signicantly increased Bax, Bcl-2 in the course of apoptosis. Tanshinone IIA increased the expression of cleaved caspases-7 and -8. Tanshinone IIA was shown to be an active ingredient of SMR that may be a useful chemotherapeutic strategy for the third-most commonly diagnosed cancer worldwide [ 1]. Although surgery plays a key role in the diagnosis and treatment of colorectal cancer, there are still increasing attempts to stop the progression of this cancer via the application of new synthetic and naturally-occuring compounds [ 2,3]. Bioactive compounds from plants have been screened for anticancer activities [ 4,5]. Approximately 50-60% of cancer patients in the United States utilize complementary and alternative medicines with traditional therapeutic regimens, such as radiation therapy and chemotherapy [ 6]. Apoptosis pathways are important targets in cancer-related therapies, and insu cient apoptosis results in uncontrolled cancer cell proliferation [ 7]. The use of natural phytochemicals for inhibiting cancer cell proliferation and inducing apoptosis contributes to promoting cancer cell death [ 8,9]. Natural phytochemicals are multiple-target molecules found in plants and microorganisms, and they exert strong anticancer activity [ 10,11]. Phytochemicals isolated from natural sources also exhibit various benecial e ects against inflammation, cancer, and neurodegenerative disorders [ 10]. This /journal/applsci 81Appl. Sci. 2020 ,10, 1304 broad spectrum of biological and pharmacological activities has made natural compounds suitable candidates for treating multifactorial diseases, such as colorectal cancer. Salviae miltiorrhizae Radix (SMR) is one of the well-known traditional herbal medicines and has been used in Asian countries [ 8]. Recently, there has been increasing scientic attention towards SMR for its remarkable bioactivity against cardiovascular disease, renal damage, tumor angiogenesis, and tumor cell invasion [ 12-14]. In the last decade, accumulating evidence has shown that SMR exerts a signicant anticancer e ect against promyelocytic leukemia, cancer, ovarian carcinomas, and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) [ 15-17]. In a recent pharmacology-based study on the anti- HCC eect of SMR, 62 chemical compounds form SMR yielded 101 putative targets that played a critical role in HCC via multiple targets and pathways, especially the EGFR and 3-kinase 18]. However, the eect of SMR and its compounds on human colon cancer cells has not been fully elucidated. The aim of the present study was to simultaneously analyze the compounds of SMR and determine their cytotoxic e ects on HCT-116 human colorectal cancer cells. and Methods2.1.

Preparation of 70% Ethanol SMR Extract Dried SMR (0.3 kg) was extracted with 70% ethanol (3.0 L, 3 times) fo r1ha tr o o m temperature by a Branson 8510 ultrasonicator (Denbury, CT, USA). The extract 150 mm \u00d8 lter paper (Whatman, Maidstone, Kent, UK) under vacuum, concentrated to remove the organic extract solvent (ethanol) using a B\u00fcchi rotary evaporator R-210 (Flawil, FD-5525L freeze-drier (Dongducheon, Korea) to obtain powdered extract. The yield of lyophilized 70% ethanol extract of SMR was 69.8 g (23.3%). 2.4. HPLC Analysis of Five Components in SMR HPLC analysis was conducted using the Prominence LC-20A Series instruments (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan) consisting of a DGU-20A 3degasser, LC-20AT solvent delivery unit, SIL-20A auto sample injector, column oven, and SPD-M20A photodiode array detector. All chromatographic data were obtained and analyzed with the LabSolution software (Version 5.53; SP3, Kyoto, Japan). Five components were separated using a reverse-phase SunFireTMC18analytical column (4.6 \u00d7250 mm, 5 m; Waters, Torrance, CA, USA) at 40C with gradient solvent condition. The mobile phases consisted of 0.1% (v/v) aqueous formic acid (A) and 0.1% (v /v) formic acid in acetonitrile (B) and were following 100-10% B. The re-equilibrium time was adjusted for 10 min.

It was also diluted 20-fold for quantication of salvianolic acid B. All samples were ltered using a membrane lter (0.2- m, Pall Life Sciences, Ann Arbor, MI, USA) before analysis. 2.5. Cell Culture The human colon cancer cell (HCT-116) was purchased from the ATCC (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA, USA). The cell was maintained and grown in RPMI 1640 medium (Roswell Park Memorial Institute 1640; Corning, Manassas, VA, USA) contained with 10% FBS (fetal serum; Gibco BRL, Carlsbad, MD, USA) and penicillin /streptomycin (Life Technologies, Waltham, MA, USA). The condition of the incubator was 37C and humidied atmosphere containing 5% CO 2. 2.6. Cell Viability Assay The cell viability assay was assessed using an Ez-Cytox Kit (Dail Lab Service Co., Seoul, Korea) based on the manufacturer's instructions [ 19]. Briefly, the cells were seeded in a 96-well plate at 1 \u00d7104 cells/well and then incubated. After 24 h, the cells were treated with the indicated concentrations of each sample, and the cells were then incubated for 24 h. Following incubation, Ez-Cytox solution was mixed with medium in each well and incubated for 1 h. The absorbance at 450 /600 nm was determined using a SPARK 10M (Tecan Group Ltd., M\u00e4nnedorf, Switzerland). The cell viability of 100% was calculated from control cells. 2.7. Hoechst 33342 Cell Staining Sample-induced nuclear condensation of HCT-116 cells was observed using Hoechst 33342 staining (Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) [ 20]. Briefly, the cells were seeded in a 6-well plate at 4 \u00d7 105cells per well. Following incubation for 24 h, the cells were treated with various concentrations of each sample, and the cells were then incubated for 24 h. Following incubation, Hoechst 33342 solution was added to the cells and incubated for 10 min. The stained cells were observed using a CCD camera conjugated IX50 fluorescent microscope (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan).2.8. Western Blotting The apoptosis signaling pathways of HCT-116 cells induced by samples were performed using Western blot analysis [ 21,22]. Briefly, the cells were seeded in a 6-well plate at 4 \u00d7105cells/well and then incubated. After 24 h, the cells were treated with the indicated concentrations of each sample, and the cells were then incubated for 24 h. Following incubation, the cells were harvested with a scraper and lysed with radio-immunoprecipitation assay bu er (Elpis Biotech, Daejeon, Korea). The protein concentrations were calculated with the Pierce BCA Protein Assay Kit (Thermo Scientic, Carlsbad, CA, USA). The protein samples were separated by electrophoresis in a SDS-PAGE. Then, the proteins were transferred to PVDF membranes (Merck Millipore, Darmstadt, Germany). The membranes were conducted blockading by 5% skim milk. Then, the membranes were probed with incubating with secondary antibodies for anti-rabbit IgG (Cell Signaling Technology, Inc., Danvers, MA, USA). 83Appl. Sci. 2020 ,10, 1304 2.9.

Statistical analysis using Student's t-test was conducted and considered statistically signicant based on p-values less than 0.05. 3. Results and Discussion In the present study, we analyzed ve bioactive marker components found in SMR, consisting of four phenolic acids (salvianic acid A, ca eic acid, rosmarinic acid, and salvianolic acid B) and one terpenoid (tanshinone IIA). These compounds were separated with resolution >5.0 within 45 min and retention times of 5.87, 11.11, 17.72, 20.42, and 42.51 min, respectively (Figure 1). The content of rosmarinic acid, ca eic acid, salvianic acid A, salvianolic acid B, and tanshinone IIA in the samples was 3.72, 0.123, 1.27, mg 70% ethanol extract of Salviae Radix. We initially performed a cytotoxic evaluation using HCT-116 human colorectal carcinoma cells. As shown in Figure 2, only tanshinone IIA signicantly decreased cell viability in a concentration-dependent manner, whereas 61.6 M SMR showed approximately 50% suppression. 84Appl. Sci. 2020 ,10, 1304 Figure 2. Cytotoxic and IIA ( 5) on HCT-116 cells. Many clinical anticancer drugs are known to exert their e ects by inducing apoptosis [ 23]. Apoptosis is a gene-regulated response and, from the morphological point of view, is distinguished by the specic structural changes in cells, such as plasma membrane bleb formation, cell and nuclear shrinkage, oligonucleosomal DNA fragmentation, and chromatin condensation [ 24]. Morphological analyses showed that both SMR and tanshinone IIA decreased the number of cells and induced signs of cellular apoptosis, such as cellular shrinkage (Figure 3). Moreover, as shown in Figure 4, Hoechst staining also showed that both SMR and tanshinone IIA increased nuclear condensation, suggesting that SMR and tanshinone IIA successfully induced apoptosis, not necrosis, in human colorectal cancer cells. However, tanshinone IIA was not cytotoxic to LLC-PK1 pig kidney epithelial cell, which is normal cell lines, up to 100 M (Supplementary Figure S1). 85Appl. Sci. 2020 ,10, 1304 Figure 3. ( B) Fluorescence microscopic images of apoptotic HCT-116 cells stained with Hoechst 33342. Two major molecular pathways that trigger programmed cell death are the caspase-mediated intrinsic pathway, which is induced by cellular stresses, and the extrinsic pathway, which is related to the death receptor [ 25]. Both pathways activate the apoptotic caspases, resulting in morphological and biochemical cellular alterations related to apoptosis [ 26]. In addition, the extrinsic pathway controls cell turnover by decreasing mutant cells. In the extrinsic pathway, cancer cell death is triggered by the interaction with death ligands (such as tumor necrosis factor) and its death receptors. The cancer cell death-initiating complex stimulates the activation of caspase-3 and -8, which are e ector and starter caspases, respectively [ 27,28]. The intrinsic pathway, which is typically activated in response to DNA or cellular damage, stimulates the expression of proteins in mitochondria, such as cytochrome c, which then activates caspase-3 and -9. [ 27,29]. It was also reported that after cleavage by caspase-9, caspase-3 inhibits reactive oxygen species production and is thus required for e cient induction of apoptosis, whereas caspase-7 is required for apoptotic cell elimination [ 30]. In our present study, the expressions of cleaved caspase-7 and -8 were signicantly increased by tanshinone IIA, but there was no change in that of cleaved caspase-9 (Figure 4). 86Appl. Sci. 2020 ,10, 1304 Figure of Graph of relative protein expression. Data are the means of experiments performed in triplicate. Data are presented as the mean \u00b1SD. and were analyzed using the Student's t-test. * p<0.05 versus non-treated cells. Furthermore, anti- and pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 members play critical roles in the mitochondria-mediated pathway. That is, the ratio of anti- and pro-apoptotic proteins (e.g., Bax /Bcl-2) is considered as a determinant of survival or apoptosis of cancer cells [ 31]. Earlier studies have reported that the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 members, which consist of Bcl-xl, Bcl-2, Bcl-w, and Mcl-1, exert an important role in the resistance of cancer cells to chemotherapy. Therefore, a reduction in Bcl-2 and an increase in Bax stimulate the apoptosis process and eliminate cancer cells [ 32]. Our western blotting analysis results showed increased Bax expression and decreased Bcl-2 expression in cells co-treated with tanshinone IIA, which was stronger than SMR (Figure 4); however, no dierence was observed in poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) expression, which is a parameter for stress and DNA damage in cells. In summary, we simultaneously analyzed ve compounds (salvianic acid A, rosmarinic acid, salvianolic acid B, ca eic acid, and tanshinone IIA) from SMR, and determined their cytotoxic e ects on HCT-116 human colon cancer cells. Among the ve compounds in SMR, only tanshinone IIA signicantly decreased cell viability in a concentration-dependent manner. Both SMR and tanshinone IIA increased nuclear condensation, suggesting that SMR and tanshinone IIA successfully induced apoptosis. We also found that tanshinone induced apoptotic cell death and signicantly increased cleaved caspases-7, -8, and Bax expression, as well as decreased Bcl-2 expression in the course of apoptosis. Taken together, our data show that tanshinone IIA is an active ingredient of SMR and may be a useful chemotherapeutic strategy for patients with colorectal cancer. 87Appl.

Pinto2,* 1cE3c\u2014Centre for Ecology, Evolution and Environmental Changes /Azorean Biodiversity Group & University of Azores, Rua M Deus, 9501-801 Ponta Delgada, 2019 Abstract: Chalcones and flavanones are isomeric structures and also classes of natural products, belonging to the flavonoid family. Moreover, their wide range of biological activities makes them key scaolds for the synthesis of new and more e cient drugs. In this work, the synthesis of hydroxy and/or methoxychalcones was studied using less common bases, such as sodium hydride (NaH) and lithium bis(trimethylsilyl)amide (LiHMDS), in the aldol condensation. The results show that the use of NaH was more e ective for the synthesis of 2/prime-hydroxychalcone derivatives, while LiHMDS led to the synthesis of polyhydroxylated chalcones in a one-pot process. During this study, it was also possible to establish the conditions that favor their isomerization into flavanones, allowing at the same time the synthesis of hydroxy and /or methoxyflavanones. The chalcones and flavanones obtained were evaluated to disclose their antioxidant, anticholinesterasic, antibacterial and antitumor activities. 2/prime,4/prime,4-Trihydroxychalcone was the most active compound in terms of antioxidant, anti-butyrylcholinesterase (IC 5026.55\u00b10.55g/mL, similar to control drug donepezil, IC5028.94\u00b11.76g/mL) and antimicrobial activity. 4/prime,7-Dihydroxyflavanone presented dual inhibition, that is, the ability to inhibit both cholinesterases. 4/prime-Hydroxy-5,7-dimethoxyflavanone and 2/prime-hydroxy-4-methoxychalcone were the compounds with the best antitumor activity. The substitution pattern and the biological assay results allowed the establishment of some known as chalcones, belong to the flavonoids family and are an important class of natural products across the plant kingdom [ 1]. Structurally, these compounds contain two aromatic rings, bonded by a three-carbon ,unsaturated carbonyl bridge (Figure 1), which are synthesized in plants as the C15 key intermediate in the biosynthesis of the other flavonoids [ 2]. Flavanones are also naturally occurring compounds and are chalcones' isomeric forms. In fact, the equilibrium between chalcones and flavanones is common in nature and is regulated by chalcone-isomerase [ 3]. Appl. Sci. 2019 ,9, 2846 Figure 1. Basic chalcone structure. Besides their natural occurrence, both chalcones and flavanones can be obtained synthetically and are often used as the preferred starting material for the synthesis of other polycyclic aromaticcompounds [ 4]. Furthermore, they present great pharmacological potential with a wide variety of biological activities, including antioxidant [ 5], anticancer [ 6-8], and antimicrobial activities [ 9-12], and also the ability to treat cardiovascular diseases and their risk factors [ 13-16], among others [ 17]. On the other hand, cancer, neurodegenerative diseases, oxidative stress-related diseases and multi-resistant bacterial infections are, after cardiovascular diseases, the top four health problems that cause the most victims every year, leading to higher medicine consumption and putting great pressure on the national health systems of many countries [ 18-24]. These problems occur either due to a lack of eective medicines to treat diseases, such as neurodegenerative ones, or due to the increasing drug resistance presented by numerous pathogenic bacteria and by some cancers. Therefore, exploring well-known scaolds as lead compounds will help in the battle against diseases that a ect humanity. Putting together the facts stated above, the synthesis of chalcone-based functionalized derivatives remains a popular research objective. The most common and e cient approach to obtain the chalcone nucleus is the aldol condensation of substituted acetophenones with proper substituted benzaldehydes in the presence of a base, namely sodium or potassium hydroxide [ 25-28]. Despite the eciency of this method, when planning a synthesis some drawbacks should be considered. For instance, the protection of the reagents' hydroxyl groups should be done previously, the acetophenone hydrogen acidity should be analyzed, and by-products can be obtained if the bases are also good nucleophilic species [ 29,30]. In this regard, the objective of this work is to synthesize hydroxy- and /or methoxychalcones by aldol condensation, using the less common bases sodium hydride and lithium bis(trimethylsilyl)amide. Also, this work studies their antioxidant, anticholinesterasic, antibacterial and antitumor activities, aiming to establish some potential medicinal applications. Simultaneously, a structure /activity relationship was established, and the isomeric equilibrium chalcone-flavanone was also studied. 2. Materials and Methods2.1. General Methods The1H,13C, HSQC and HMBC NMR spectra were measured on Bruker AMC 300 or 500 instruments, operating at 300.13 MHz and 75.47 or 500.13 and 125.75 MHz. Chemical were reported relative to tetramethysilane (TMS) in units (ppm) and coupling constants ( J) Hz. Chromatographic purications were carried out by prep. TLC on silica gel (Merck silica gel 60 F 254), the spots being visualized under a UV lamp (at 254 and /or 366 nm). Melting points were determined with a Stuart scientic SPM3 apparatus and are uncorrected. The mass spectra were acquired using ESI(+) with a Micromass Q-Tof 2TMmass spectrometer. 2.2. Synthesis of Chalcones and Flavanones Synthesis of the compounds described below follows the general scheme outlined in 3.1 (Scheme 1). 2/prime-Hydroxy-4,4/prime,6/prime-trimethoxychalcone 1. Compound 1was synthesized by mixing 2/prime-hydroxy-4/prime,6/prime- dimethoxyacetophenone (661.3 mg, 3.37 mmol) in a mL) amount of tetrahydrofuran (THF) with sodium hydride (NaH) (2.5 equivalents), under nitrogen atmosphere at room temperature. After 30 min of stirring, 4-methoxybenzaldehyde (1.2 equivalents) was added to the reaction mixture and allowed to react for 3 h. The product was precipitated from the reaction 92Appl. Sci. 2019 ,9, 2846 mixture by pouring onto ground ice and acidifying to pH <2 with HCl 37%. The solid was ltered and washed with water until pH >5. The crude product was crystallized from ethanol and the desired compound 1was obtained (928.1 mg, 88% yield). 5,7-Dihydroxy-4/prime-methoxyflavanone 4. The procedure to obtain this compound involved 3 di erent steps: (a) The benzylation of the hydroxyl groups: the 4/primeand 6/prime-hydroxyl groups in the starting material 2/prime,4/prime,6/prime-trihydroxyacetophenone were protected using the methodology described by Figueiredo [ 32]. Briefly, the 2/prime,4/prime,6/prime-trihydroxyacetophenone (2.7 g, 16.1 mmol), dissolved in a minimum amount of dry dimethylformamide (DMF) (~20 mL), was mixed with K 2CO 3(6 equivalents) under constant stirring. Then, benzyl bromide (3 equivalents) was added and the reaction was performed at 150 C under reflux for 2 h. After that, the reaction mixture was filtered to remove the K 2CO 3and the inorganic salts washed with DMF. The filtrate was poured over crushed ice and the mixtureacidified to pH<5 with HCl 20%. The precipitated 4 /prime,6/prime-dibenzyloxy-2/prime-hydroxyacetophenone was filtered and crystallized from ethanol (4.75 g, 85% yield). (b) The aldol condensation: The synthesis of 4/prime,6/prime-dibenzyloxy-2/prime-hydroxy-4-methoxychalcone 2was performed by dissolving 4/prime,6/prime-benzyloxy-2/prime-hydroxyacetophenone (1.5566 g) in dried THF and was then mixed with NaH (2.5 equivalents). After 10 min of stirring under nitrogen atmosphere at room temperature, 4-methoxybenzaldehyde (1.2 equivalents) was added. The reaction was nished after 3 h by pouring over crushed ice and addition of HCl 37% to pH <2. The precipitate was ltered and washed with water, and the crude product was crystallized from acetone to aord 4/prime,6/prime-dibenzyloxy-2/prime-hydroxy-4-methoxychalcone 2(1.6573 g, 80% yield). The step was deprotecting the hydroxyl at 4/primeand 6/prime positions by cleavage of the benzyl groups. This procedure was adapted from the method described by Gomes et al. [ 33]. Briefly, 4/prime,6/prime-dibenzyloxy-2/prime-hydroxy-4-methoxychalcone 2(567.0 mg) was mixed with 40 mL of a mixture of HCl /Acetic acid (1:10) under stirring at 80C during 13 h. The reaction was nished by pouring the mixture over crushed ice, the solid formed was washed with water until pH ~ 5 and then puried by TLC, eluting The synthesis of this compound also involved the 3 steps mentioned above for compound 4. (a) The benzylation of the hydroxyl groups: the 4-hydroxybenzaldehyde (1.3 g, 10.6 mmol) was dissolved in a minimum of dry dimethylformamide (DMF) (~15 mL), and it was mixed with K2CO 3(3 equivalents) under constant stirring. Then, benzyl bromide (1.5 equivalents) was added, and the reaction was performed at 150C under reflux for 2 h. After that, the reaction mixture 93Appl. Sci. 2019 ,9, 2846 was ltered to remove the K 2CO 3and washed with DMF. The ltrate was poured over crushed ice and HCl 20% added until pH <5. The precipitated 4-benzyloxybenzaldehyde was ltered and crystallized from ethanol g, 78%). (b) The aldol condensation: The 2/prime-hydroxy-4/prime,6/prime-dimethoxyacetophenone (898.3 mg) was dissolved in dried THF (~15 mL) and mixed with NaH (2.5 equivalents) at room temperature and under N2atmosphere. After 10 min, 4-benzyloxybenzaldehyde (1.2 equivalents) was added, and the reaction was nished after 4 h by precipitation over crushed ice acidied with HCl 37% to pH <2. benzyl group's cleavage: The chalcone 3(330.6 mg) was mixed with 30 mL of a mixture of HCl/Acetic acid (1:10) under stirring at 55C during 60 h. The reaction was nished by pouring the mixture over crushed ice, the formed solid was washed with water until pH ~5 and puried by TLC mg) was dissolved in dried toluene and mixed with 10 mL o f a 1 mol.dm3solution of LiHMDS (6.6 equivalents), under nitrogen atmosphere, at room temperature. After 30 min, 4-hydroxybenzaldehyde (1.2 equivalents) was added, and the reaction was stirred for 5 days. The reaction was nished, poured over crushed ice and acidied to pH <2 with HCl 37%. The mixture was extracted with CH 2Cl2and puried by TLC, using a mixture of eluent 4/prime,7-dihydroxyflavanone obtained as yellow amorphous powder, respectively, 18.2 mg (5%) and 8.2 mg (2%). Approximately 80% of 2.3. Biological Activities Compound 2/prime-hydroxy-4-methoxychalcone 8was provided by the Laboratory of Organic Chemistry of the University of Aveiro, and the reactional conditions, yield and spectroscopic data are reported by Silva et al. [ 35,36]. 94Appl. Sci. 2019 ,9, 2846 2.3.1. scavenging assay [ 37]. dilutions of studied or reference compounds (Trolox and quercetin) were carried out in 96-well microplates, at di erent concentrations, ranging between 0.148 g/mL and 150 g/mL in methanol. DPPH dissolved in methanol was added to the microwells, yielding a nal concentration of 45g/mL, and the absorbance at 515 nm was measured in a Bio Rad Model 680 Microplate Reader (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc., Hercules, CA, USA), after 30 min in the dark. In each assay, a control was prepared, in which the sample or standard was substituted by the same amount of solvent. Percentage of antioxidant activity (%AA) was calculated as: %AA=100 [1(AcontrolAsample )/Acontrol ] where A control is the absorbance of the control, and A sample is the absorbance of the chalcone /flavanone or standard. All assays were carried out in triplicate and results expressed as EC 50, i.e., as the concentration yielding 50% scavenging of DPPH, calculated by interpolation from the %AA vs concentration curve. 2.3.2. ABTS Scavenging Activity To determine ABTS radical scavenging, the method of Re et al. [ 38] was adopted. The stock solutions included 7 mM ABTS solution and 2.4 mM potassium persulfate solution. The working solution was prepared by mixing the two stock solutions in equal quantities and allowing them to react for 12-16 h at room temperature in the dark. The solution was then diluted by mixing 1 mL ABTS solution with the amount of methanol necessary to obtain an absorbance of 0.7 at 734 nm. Serial dilutions of studied or reference compounds (trolox, quercetin) were carried out in 96-well microplates, at dierent concentrations, ranging between 0.146 g/mL and 150 g/mL in methanol. ABTS solution was then added to the microwells, and after 8 min of incubation the absorbance was taken at 405 nm in a Bio Rad Model 680 Microplate Reader (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc., Hercules, CA, USA). In each assay, a control was prepared, in which the sample or standard was substituted by the same amount of solvent. Percentage of antioxidant activity (%AA) was calculated as: (%)=[(Abs controlAbs sample )]/(Abs )]\u00d7100 Abs control is the absorbance of ABTS radical +methanol; Abs sample is the absorbance of ABTS radical+sample/standard. All assays were carried out in triplicate and results expressed as EC 50, i.e., as the concentration yielding 50% scavenging of ABTS, calculated by interpolation from the %AA vs concentration curve. 2.3.3. Anticholinesterasic Activity The assay for measuring AChE and BuChE activity was modied from the assay described by Ellman et al. [ 39] and Arruda et al. [ 40]. Briefly, 3 mM (DTNB, 5 L) or butyrylthiocoline iodide and sodium phosphate buer 0.1 mol dm3(pH 8.0, 110 L), and sample or standard (quercetin or donepezil) dissolved in buer containing no more than 2.5% DMSO were added to the wells, and serial dilutions were carried out to obtain concentrations ranging between 0.293 g/mL and 150 g/mL (0.098 0.195 100 g/mL for quercetin), followed by 0.25 U /mL AChE or BuChE (10 L). The microplate was then read at 415 nm every 2.5 min for 7.5 min in a Bio Rad Model 680 Microplate Reader (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc., Hercules, CA, USA). For each concentration, enzyme activity was calculated as a percentage of the velocities compared to that of the assay using bu er without any inhibitor. Every experiment was done in triplicate. 95Appl. Sci. 2019 ,9, 2846 2.3.4. Antimicrobial 20030 and Escherichia coli DSM498 was assessed by the broth microdilution method, as described by De Le \u00f3n et al. [ 41]. The bacteria cultures were developed in nutrient broth (NB) at 30C forB. subtilis and M. luteus and at 37C for E. coli . Briefly, compounds were added to the microplates at a concentration of 200 g/mL, and serial dilutions in NB were made until the concentration of 0.391g/mL. Then, the starting inoculum (1 \u00d7105CFU/mL) was added, and the bacterial growth was measured by the increase in optical density at 550 nm with a Bio Rad Model 680 Microplate Reader (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc., Hercules, CA, USA), after 24 h of growth (48 h for M. luteus ) at the above-mentioned temperatures for each bacterial strain. Penicillin and streptomycin were used as reference compounds. The IC 50was calculated as the concentration of compound that inhibits 50% of bacterial growth by interpolation from the % of growth inhibition vs. concentration curve. 2.3.5. Antitumor Activity Antitumor activity was determined by the method described in Moujir et al. [ 42]. A-549 (human lung carcinoma) cell line, obtained from ATCC-LGC (American Type Culture Collection), was grown as a monolayer in DMEM (Sigma) supplemented with 2% p-hydroxybenzoic acid (2 \u00d7104mg/mL) (200 maintained at 37Ci n5 %C O 2and 80% humidity in a reduction assay. Cell suspension \u00d7104cells/well) in the lag phase of growth was incubated in a 96-well microplate with the compounds or the standards (colchicine and paclitaxel) dissolved in medium, with the concentrations ranging between 0.195 g/mL and 200 g/mL (0.010 g/mL and 10 g/mL for standards). After 48 h, MTT was added to the cells, which were then allowed to incubate for 3-4 h, and the optical density was measured using a Bio Rad Model 680 Microplate Reader (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc., Hercules, CA, USA) at 550 nm after dissolving the MTT formazan with DMSO (100 L). The percentage viability (IC 50) was calculated from the % of inhibition vs. concentration curve. All the experiments were repeated three times. 3. Results and Discussion3.1. Chalcones and Flavanones Synthesis The compounds obtained in this work were synthesized by aldol condensation between 4/prime- and/or 6/prime-substituted 2/prime-hydroxyacetophenones and either 4-hydroxy or 4-methoxybenzaldehydes, using NaH and LiHMDS (Scheme 1). Scheme 1. General procedure for the synthesis of chalcones and flavanones. 96Appl. Sci. 2019 ,9, 2846 Compounds 1and 3were synthesized, as far as we could conrm, using for the rst time in the aldol condensation the strong non-nucleophilic base NaH, which was used with success in similar condensations [ 43,44]. The experimental results in the synthesis of chalcones 1-3, with very good yields (~80%) and relatively low reaction times (3 to 4 h), proves that NaH is an e ective and ecient base in the aldol condensation when it is desired to obtain non-hydroxylated chalcones, other than at the C-2/primeposition. As referred above (Introduction), the hydroxyl groups present in the reagents require protection before the aldol condensation because in the strong basic conditions used, the phenoxide ions can undergo transformation into quinones and consequently prevent the formation of the desired chalcones. So, in order to obtain the desired compounds (the ones bearing hydroxyl and /or methoxyl groups), chalcones 2and3need to be treated with acid to cleave the benzyl groups. The mixture used (HCl /AcOH) is one of the less harsh conditions and, in fact, removed the benzyl groups, but the obtained products were, in fact, flavanones 4and5(Scheme 1). This can be explained by the acidic conditions used and the fact that those conditions favor the chalcones' isomerization into flavanones [ 45]. On the other hand, these extra steps, the protection and deprotection of hydroxyl groups, contribute to decrease the overall yield. For example, if we consider the synthesis of flavanones 4and 5, their precursors' chalcones 2 and 3have excellent yields (80%), and the deprotection step, which produces the flavanones, is less ecient. This demonstrates that, due to this step, the flavanones' overall yield will be below 50%. At the same time, the yields (Scheme 1) allowed the assumption that the deprotection of the ring A hydroxyl groups is easier. Since our purpose was the synthesis of chalcones bearing hydroxyl and methoxyl groups, taking into consideration that these substituents might improve the activity, and that the synthesis of flavanones 4and5involves three steps, namely, (i) protection of the reagent's hydroxyl groups, (ii) aldol condensation and (iii) cleavage of the protecting groups, we envisaged the synthesis of the desired chalcones using another base. Knowing that LiHMDS was used in the synthesis of hydroxylated flavones without the protection step and with good results [ 46,47], we tested its use in the synthesis of chalcone 6(Scheme 1). The experimental results showed that, using LiHMDS as the base, it is possible to synthesize polyhydroxylated chalcones in a one-pot process. However, although the desired chalcone was obtained, the yield was very low and its isomeric form, flavanone 7, was also obtained. It should be highlighted that this reaction was accomplished at room temperature, controlled by TLC and nished after 5 days, when no more conversion was detected and 80% of the starting acetophenone was recovered. These data suggest that the conversion rate is high and that the reaction does not occur due to a lack of energy. We may suggest that using other sources of energy, such as a microwave, could originate higher yields. The synthesized compounds' structures were conrmed by detailed analysis of their 1D and 2D NMR spectra, MS spectra (e.g., in Figures S1-S9, supplementary material) and available literature data; moreover, their purity was conrmed by UHPLC. Herein, chalcones' and flavanones' characterization is briefly discussed. The1H NMR spectra of compounds 1-3and6present the signal characteristics of chalcone structures: (i) the resonance of the AB system assigned to the olefinic protons; (ii) doublets at H7.7-7.9 ppm with J~ which confirms the Econfiguration of the ,double bond; (iii) the signal at C~192 ppm assigned to the carbonyl group; H14.4-13.7 ppm assigned to 2/prime-OH proton signal involvement in a hydrogen bond with the carbonyl oxygen atom; (v) two sets of doublets, with J=6.8 atH6.9-7.8 ppm, assigned to the protons of the aromatic ring B (Figure 1). The1H,13C and HSQC NMR spectra of chalcone 1also display two a meta -coupling constant ( J=2.4 Hz), correlation with the signals at 93.8 and 91.2 ppm, which indicates the presence of a tetra-substituted aromatic ring (ring A, Figure 1). The three sets of singlets at H3.83-3.92 ppm, showing correlation with three signals at C 55.4-55.8 ppm, are characteristic of three methoxyl groups. The MS spectrum of chalcone 1showed a signal at m/z315 correspondent to [M +H]+, which agrees with the molecular formula C 18H18O5. 97Appl. Sci. 2019 ,9, 2846 All the spectroscopic data and the melting point are in agreement with previously published data [ 31], and additionally, the connectivities found in the HMBC NMR spectra of chalcone 6show three sets of signals in the range of C 6.38-8.12 ppm, characteristic of the a trisubstituted aromatic ring (ring A, Figure 1). The MS spectrum showed a signal at m/z257 corresponding to [M +H]+, which agrees with the molecular formula C15H12O4. These data and the connectivities found in the HMBC spectrum conrm compound 6as known as isoliquiritigenin [ 48]. Compounds 4,5and7are flavanones, and this fact is well conrmed by the presence of the signals characteristic of ring C (Scheme 1): two double doublets at H2.68-3.10 and H2.68-2.78 assigned to protons H-3, the double doublet at H5.34-5.46 ppm assigned to H-2 in coupling with H-3; the signal at 196 ppm characteristic of the carbonyl group (C =O). Hz, indicate the presence of a para-substituted aromatic ring (ring B). The presence of the methoxyl group in the ring B of compound 4is deduced from the singlet at3.83, correlating with the signal at C55.4 ppm. The MS data showed a signal at m/z287 corresponding to the protonated molecule [M +H]+that is in accordance with the molecular formula C16H14O5. The spectroscopic data and the melting point are consistent with the published data for isosakuranetin [ 33,49], and together with the connectivities found in HMBC spectrum, conrm that compound 4is 5,7-dihydroxy-4/prime-methoxyflavanone. The signals found in the1H and13C NMR spectra of compound 5are very similar to the ones found for compound 4. The dierences are the non-appearance of the signal at H12.05 ppm, which conrms the absence of a 5-O Hgroup; and the appearance of two singlets at H3.86 and 3.81 ppm, which means that compound 5has two methoxyl groups. The location of the two methoxyl groups and the hydroxyl group were conrmed by the connectivities found in the HMBC spectrum of compound 5. All the spectroscopic data are compatible with the structure of 4/prime-hydroxy-5,7-dimethoxyflavanone, also named naringenin 5,7-dimethyl ether. Although compound 5is not new, [ 50,51], to the best of our knowledge, the full spectroscopic data are reported here for the rst time. The quasi-molecular ion at m/z257, compatible with molecular formula C 15H12O4, conrms that compound 7is an isomeric form of compound 6. The presences of two signals at H9.53 and 8.60 ppm are assigned to 7-O Hand 4/prime-OH, respectively, by the connectivities found in the HMBC spectrum. Moreover, the spectroscopic data are identical to that previously published for 4/prime,7-dihydroxyflavanone, also named liquiritigenin [ 52]. 3.2. Biological Evaluations The antioxidant, anticholinesterasic, antimicrobial and antitumor activities of the compounds bearing hydroxyl and methoxyl groups were studied, and the results obtained are presented and discussed in the following paragraphs. Compound 8,2/prime-hydroxy-4-methoxychalcone, was not synthesized in this work, but was included in the bioactivities study because it is, in structural terms, one of the simplest 2/prime-hydroxychalcones and can be used as a reference and as a starting point to analyze structure /activity relationships of the compounds that were synthesized. 3.2.1. Antioxidant Activity In the DPPH (1,1-diphenyl-2-picryl-hydrazyl) scavenging test, the capacity of the compounds to neutralize the DPPH radical via electron transfer is measured [ 53,54]. Nearly all the compounds had some antioxidant activity, which was concentration-dependent (see Supplementary Materials, Figure S10), except for compounds 4and8, which only had a residual activity at the highest concentration tested (150 g/mL). Chalcone 6, the most active compound, presented higher antioxidant activity than the isomeric flavanone 7(Table 1), conrming that the conjugated double bond improves the molecule's ability to scavenge the DPPH radical [ 55]. 98Appl. Sci. 2019 ,9, 2846 Table 1. Antioxidant activity of the synthesized compounds In each column, the letters a, b, c, d, and e indicate signicant di erences ( p<0.05). The results also conrm that the number of free hydroxyl groups influences antioxidant activity, since compounds with a higher number of these groups present better activity [ 55], a fact that is also conrmed by the lower activity of the compounds with more methoxyl groups (Figure 2). Figure 2. Structure/activity relationships established for DPPH scavenging activity. A previous work reported that compound 6presented a low antioxidant activity in the DPPH scavenging 56] (86.92\u00b10.43% of DPPH inhibition at 150 g/mL); however, since the maximum concentration used in that work was about six times lower than the maximum tested concentration in the present work, it does not conflict with the results herein reported. Another test used was the ABTS (2,2'-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulphonic acid)) scavenging assay. This assay measures the ability of compounds to neutralize the ABTS radical by radical quenching via hydrogen atom transfer. However, it can also be neutralized by electron transfer on some occasions, resulting in a higher sensitivity of this method when compared with the DPPH assay [ 53,57]. Again, compound 6was the one presenting the best activity, with an IC 50of 12.72g/mL (Table 1), which is another result that conrms the importance of the hydroxyl groups in the chalcone sca old for their ability to reduce and /or eliminate free radicals. This conclusion is conrmed by the lower activity of chalcones 1and 8, which have only one hydroxyl group. Compound 5presents better activity than 4, which means that the relative position between the hydroxyl and methoxyl groups is more important than the number of hydroxyl groups on the flavanone sca old. This is conrmed by the results obtained for compound 7, which has two hydroxyl groups, but only one substituent in ring A, and presents lower activity than compounds 4and 5(Figure 3). It was observed that the ABTS scavenging activity of the tested compounds is dose-dependent (Figure S11, supplementary material). Figure 3. Structure/activity relationships established for ABTS scavenging activity. 99Appl. Sci. 2019 ,9, 2846 3.2.2. Anticholinesterasic Activity The results for acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitory activity showed that compound 7is the only one which presents some activity at the maximum concentration tested (47.1 \u00b13.6%, at 150 g/mL). This activity is less pronounced than the inhibition obtained for control compound donepezil (95.2 \u00b10.4% at 50g/mL), a pure competitive inhibitor of AChE used clinically in early stages of Alzheimer's disease. The results suggest that the cyclization seems to increase the inhibitory activity of the compound, since compound 7, which is a flavanone, is more active than compound 6, the respective chalcone. Also, the existence of free hydroxyl groups in both A and B rings seems to be important because, out of the three compounds with a flavanone structure (compounds 4,5and 7), only the one with a free hydroxyl group in both C-7 and C-4/prime(compound 7) shows activity. This is in agreement with the strong activity revealed by quercetin, whose structure also possesses free hydroxyl groups in both rings A and B, like compound 7. So, it can be concluded that the presence of hydroxyl groups in rings A and B of the flavanone scaold is crucial for the inhibition of AChE activity (Figure 4). Figure 4. Structure/activity relationships established for antioxidant activity. In terms of butyrylcholinesterase inhibition, compound 6presented excellent activity, with a percentage of inhibition of 96.0 \u00b11.1% and IC 50of 26.55\u00b10.55g/mL, which are similar values to the ones presented by donepezil (IC 50of 28.94\u00b11.76g/mL) and better than quercetin at the same concentrations. This shows that, unlike what happens with acetylcholinesterase, the presence of three hydroxyl groups in the chalcone sca old highly favors the inhibition of butyrylcholinesterase activity. The results presented by chalcones 1(12.51\u00b10.82%) and 8(0%) also conrm that, like with acetylcholinesterase, the presence of methoxyl groups does not confer inhibitory activity to chalcones. Compound 7presents an activity very similar to the one observed for acetylcholinesterase inhibition (46.26\u00b11.27%), meaning that it is a dual inhibitor, a much-appreciated feature in the search for compounds with therapeutic potential towards Alzheimer's disease. The presence of a hydroxyl group in ring B of the flavanone sca old increases its inhibitory e ect, since flavanones 5(36.30\u00b10.20%) and 7present higher activity than flavanone 4(9.00\u00b11.30%), which has a methoxyl group in said position (Figure 4). The compounds inhibited butyrylcholinesterase in a dose-dependent manner (Figure S12, supplementary material). 3.2.3. Antimicrobial Activity As observable in Table 2, most of the compounds tested inhibited the growth of gram-positive bacteria, but none was e ective against the gram-negative strain tested. This inhibition was found to be concentration-dependent (Figures S13 and S14). The most ecient compounds against Micrococcus luteus were 6and 7, both with similar IC 50, which suggests that cyclization does not influence the toxicity of these molecules against this species. These results are concordant with the literature, since it is described that these compounds presented similar activity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis [58]. Although some compounds tested exhibit an IC 50value greater than 200 g/mL, the percent of growth inhibition exhibited at the maximum concentration tested allows one to deduce some interesting structure /activity relationships, which are discussed below. The chalcone 1had against of growth inhibition at 200 g/mL. These results suggest that the presence of methoxyl groups at ring A reduces its activity against this species. The same e ect is observed when comparing the activity of compounds 4and 5(Figure 5). 100Appl. Sci. 2019 ,9, 2846 Table 2. Antimicrobial activity of synthesized compounds 1,4-8. Compounds and ReferencesIC50g/mL (\u00b1SD) M. luteus B. (\u00b11.73) In each column, the letters a, b, c, d, and e indicate signicant di erences ( p<0.05). Figure 5. Structure/activity relationships established ect against M. luteus . Compound 5inhibits 43.08% of bacterial growth at 200 g/mL, while this value is almost double for compound 4(74.43\u00b11.95%), which conrms that the methoxyl groups at ring A decrease the molecule's antibacterial e ect. The strongest activity against Bacillus subtilis was displayed by compound 6(IC50=9.33g/mL), presenting even better activity than streptomycin (Table 2). The corresponding flavanone 7has a higher IC50(20.48g/mL), which leads to the conclusion that the ,unsaturated carbonyl bridge linking ring A to ring B is important in the mode of action of the compounds against this bacterial strain. The molecules with the higher numbers of hydroxyl groups are the ones with better activity, showing that these groups also play an important role in the molecule's mode of action against B. subtilis . Again, the compounds with two methoxyl groups in meta positioning ( 1and 5) were the ones with lower or none antimicrobial activity. Comparing the results from compounds 4and 7(both flavanones with two hydroxyl groups), one can conclude that the presence of the methoxyl group in ring B (compound 4) reduces the compound's activity against this bacterial strain (Figure 6). Figure 6. Structure/activity relationships established for antibacterial e ect against B. subtilis . 3.2.4. Antitumor Activity Considering the antitumor activity of the studied compounds, it can be noticed that compounds 5 and 8were the most active, presenting very similar IC 50values. Compounds 1and 4showed some activity, although lower than the ones mentioned above (Table 3). However, none of the compounds tested were as active as colchicine or paclitaxel, the reference compounds used (Table 3). It was also observed that the inhibition of tumor cell growth is dose-dependent for all the compounds tested (Figure S15, supplementary material). 101Appl. Sci. 2019 ,9, 2846 Table 3. Antitumor activity of the synthesized compounds 1,4-8. Compounds and ReferencesIC50g/mL A549 (\u00b10.71)d In each column the letters a, b, c, d, and e indicate signicant di erences ( p<0.05). Results for the activity of compounds 6and 7against the A549 cell line have already been reported in the literature [ 7,59-61]; however, their activity was tested in order to facilitate the comparison of the results, since all the compounds were tested in the same conditions. The results for compound 7are concordant with the literature, since it is reported that the e ects of this compound in A549 cells is limited to the inhibition of cell migration, without any e ects on growth or cytotoxicity level [ 7,60]. Compound 6did not present any activity, which was unexpected, since it is reported to possess antitumor activity against several cell lines, including A549, by inhibiting proliferation and inducing tumor cell apoptosis [ 59,61]. This can be explained by the fact that the authors used a much lower cell concentration than the one used in the present work, and it has been proved that lower cell concentrations are correlated with higher activities of the compounds tested [ 62]. From the results obtained, the only conclusions that can be drawn regarding structure /activity relationships are that neither the ,unsaturated carbonyl bridge nor the cyclization of chalcone into flavanone have an influence in the inhibition of tumor-cell growth, since both chalcones and flavanones presented interesting activities (Figure 7). Also, the presence of methoxyl groups has some importance in the antitumor e ect of the compounds, since compounds 6and 7, which do not have methoxyl groups, did not present any activity against the A549 cell line (Table 3). The influence of a methoxyl group in synthetic polyphenolic compounds' antitumor activity was not a surprise because it was previously detected in our group [ 63]. Figure 7. Structure/activity relationships established for antitumor activity. 4. Conclusions Hydroxylated chalcone /flavanone derivatives were synthesized using the less common bases NaH or LiHMDS. Overall, it was shown that the use of NaH is e cient (~80% yield in 3-4 h) for the synthesis of chalcones not hydroxylated other than at C-2/primeposition. However, if the desired derivatives are polyhydroxylated chalcones, the use of LiHMDS is preferable, because the conversion rate is good and it is a one-pot procedure that avoids the protection and subsequent deprotection steps, a time-consuming procedure that also signicantly decreases the total yield. Although the aim of this work was to obtain the compounds for biological evaluation, we suggest microwave or ultrasound irradiation as a better source of energy to increase the compounds' yields, an aspect that is important for their future applications. 102Appl. Sci. 2019 ,9, 2846 Some of the compounds synthesized presented interesting results in their bioactivities, with chalcone 6being the most active compound in terms of antioxidant, anti-butyrylcholinesterase and antimicrobial activity. Its isomer, flavanone 7, showed activity against both acetylcholinesterase and butyrylcholinesterase, which is an interesting result since this dual inhibition is a much-appreciated feature in Alzheimer's disease therapy. Also, it is interesting that these compounds can be obtained in the one-pot methodology using LiHMDS. Some important structure /activity relationships were established for all the activities tested, and the most important are highlighted and summarized in Figure 8. Figure 8. Summary of the most relevant structure /activity relationships established. As shown in Figure 8, the free hydroxyl groups are essential to increase antioxidant, anti-butyrylcholinesterase and antimicrobial activities. Not only their presence but also their number increases the compounds' activity, while methoxyl groups decrease it. The flavanone sca old increases the acetylcholinesterase inhibitory activity, while for the butyrylcholinesterase inhibition, the chalcone scaold appears to be better. This is another interesting result because it is known that these compounds are isomers, and in biological systems they can exist in a controlled equilibrium. Regarding the antimicrobial activity, it is possible to detect that the cyclization into flavanone has no e ect against theM. luteus strain, whereas against B. subtilis , the flavanone decreases the antibacterial activity. So, it seems that the ,unsaturated carbonyl bridge linking rings A and B is important to inhibit the growth of the B. subtilis strain. Finally, it can be established that the presence of methoxyl groups in both chalcones and flavanones increases the antitumor activity.

Since ancient times, humans have used medicinal plants for the treatment of diabetes. Medicinal plants continue to serve as natural sources for the discovery of antidiabetic compounds. Prangos pabularia Lindl. is a widely distributed herb with large reserves in Tajikistan. Its roots and fruits have been used in Tajik traditional medicine. To our best knowledge, there are no previously published reports concerning the antidiabetic activity and the chemical composition of the essential oil obtained from roots of P. pabularia . (2) Methods: The volatile secondary metabolites were obtained by hydrodistillation from the underground parts of P . pabularia growing wild in Tajikistan and were analyzed by gas chromatography (GC) molecular docking analysis were carried out to evaluate the potential antidiabeticactivity of the P . pabularia essential oil. (3) Results: The main constituents of the volatile oil of and resulted in signicant inhibitory activity with an IC 50value of 0.06\u00b10.01 and 0.93\u00b10.1g/mL. Molecular docking analysis suggests volatile compounds such as osthole inhibit PTP-1B, and the results are also in agreement with experimental investigations. (4) Conclusions: Volatile secondary metabolites and the pure isolated compound (osthole) from the roots of P . pabularia exhibited potent antidiabetic activity, twenty-ve and nearly two times more than the positive control (3-(3,5-dibromo-4-hydroxybenzoyl)-2-ethylbenzofuran-6-sulfonic acid-(4-(thiazol-2-ylsulfamyl)-phenyl)-amide)) with an IC 50value of 1.46\u00b10.4g/mL, Diabetes, or diabetes mellitus, is a chronic metabolic disease associated with high blood sugar levels over a prolonged period [ 1]. In 2017, according to the International Diabetes Federation report, approximately 425 million adults (20-79 years) had diabetes worldwide with 3.2 to 5.0 million deaths from the disease [ 2]. Unfortunately, these numbers are gradually increasing in most countries. From ancient times, humans have used medicinal plants for the prevention and the therapy of diabetes mellitus. Medicinal plants serve as natural sources for the discovery of compounds with antidiabetic activities. In this relation, Tajikistan has a rich flora with around 4550 species of higher plants that represent great interest for the discovery of alternative medications for the treatment of diabetes [ 3]. Tajikistan is known for its diversity of environmental conditions, including climate, high altitudes, mountainous soil and minerals, and a relatively large number of sunny days per year, factors that can aect plant development as well as biosynthesis and accumulation of secondary metabolites [ 4,5]. Essential oils have applications in medicine, pharmaceutical, food, and cosmetic industries. They possess possible health Therefore, extensive research has been directed toward the use of medicinal plants to control diabetes mellitus and its complications [ 6]. PTP-1B to the protein It is also known as tyrosine-protein phosphatase non-receptor type 1 that is encoded by the PTPN1 gene [ 7,8]. PTP-1B is localized on the cytoplasmic face of the endoplasmic reticulum and contains the essential cysteine enzyme proteins [ 10]. PTP-1B is considered to be a promising potential therapeutic target for treatment of various diseases, including diabetes, obesity, and cancer [ 11]. It inactivates the insulin signal transduction cascade by dephosphorylating phosphotyrosine residues in the insulin-signaling pathway [ 12]. Natural, synthetic, as well as semi-synthetic compounds have shown prominent antidiabetic activities by inhibiting PTP-1B activity [ 13]. Prangos pabularia Lindl., a member of the Apiaceae, is a widely distributed herb up to 150 cm high with a thick cylindrical root and has large reserves in Tajikistan [ 14].P . pabularia , locally known as \"Yugan\", is a well-known species of the genus in Tajikistan. It typically grows in mountainous areas and limestone slopes at altitudes 780 to 3600 m above sea level [ 15]. Its roots and fruits are valued in Tajik traditional medicine and are widely used as general tonics as well as for treatment of vitiligo [ 4,15]. P . pabularia has been used to treat leukoplakia, digestive disorders, scars, and bleeding [ 16]. The root extracts of P . pabularia have been examined for cytotoxic activity; the dichloromethane extract of P . pabularia roots demonstrated notable cytotoxicity on the HeLa carcinoma cell line [ 17].P . ferulacea root is used as an eective wound healing agent in traditional medicine of the western north of Iran [ 18]. Members of the Prangos genus are natural sources of phytochemicals, including coumarins and terpenoids. Individual isolated pure compounds such as osthole and isoimperatorin showed the highest inhibitory potency against the growth of human carcinoma cell lines. Osthole exhibited the greatest cytotoxicity and was found to induce apoptosis in PC-3, H1299, and SKNMC cells at low micromolar concentrations. Thus, osthole can be considered to be a promising lead in anticancer drug discovery and development [ 17]. Several new compounds have been isolated from the essential oil of Prangos species. A new bisabolene derivative was isolated from essential oil of the fruits of Turkish endemic Prangos uechtritzii [19]. The 3,7(11)-Eudesmadien-2-one, a from Prangos heyniae & M.F. Watson essential oil [ 20]. 110Appl. Sci. 2019 ,9, 2362 The (2 S)-3,5-Nonadiyne-2-yl acetate was isolated from Prangos platychlaena ssp. platychlaena fruit essential oils [ 21]. Recently, we reported that the roots of P . pabularia are good sources of biologically others. Yuganin A potent e ects on the proliferation of B16 melanoma cells [ 22]. In a continuation of this investigation, the current report presents the promising antidiabetic activity and the chemical composition of volatile secondary metabolites of the underground parts of P . pabularia growing wild in Tajikistan. There are several reports on the composition of the essential oils isolated from leaves, fruits, and umbels of P . pabularia growing in Iran and Turkey [ 23-25], but, until now, there has been no published reports on antidiabetic activity and volatile secondary metabolites of the underground parts ofP . pabularia . 2. Results and Discussions2.1. Chemical Composition of Essential Oils Volatile secondary metabolites were obtained by hydrodistillation of P . pabularia roots growing wild in Tajikistan and were analyzed by gas chromatography (GC) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Identication of components was based on their Kovats retentionindices (RI) determined by reference to a homologous series of n-alkanes and by comparison of their mass spectral fragmentation patterns with those reported in the literature [ 26] and stored in the MS library. Forty-two compounds were identied in the volatile oil accounting as major constituents of the volatile oil obtained from roots of P . pabularia (Table 1). The structure of the osthole was established on the basis one-dimensional (1D) ionization (ESI)-MS spectroscopic studies, respectively [ 22]. The chemical structures of the main components of the essential oil from the roots of P . pabularia are presented in Figure 1. The GC-MS chromatogram of the volatile oil of P . pabularia is presented in Figure 2. Figure 1. Structures of the main components of Prangos pabularia essential oil. 111Appl.

Prangos Species Plant Part Major Components of the Essential Oil Ref. P . ferulacea aerial reported that the composition of the essential oils isolated from leaves, fruits, and umbels ofP . pabularia collected from Iran spathulenol were reported as the main constituents of the essential oil of P . pabularia fruits collected from Turkey [ 24]. The chemical composition of the root essential oil of P . pabularia diered from those from leaves, fruits, and umbels with regard to predominance of sesquiterpenes and monoterpenes. In 2016, Tabanca and co-authors reported that suberosin (1.8%) was identied in the essential oil obtained from fruits of P . pabularia were identied as the dominant constituents of the volatile oil of the roots ofP . pabularia. These major volatile compounds were not identied from the other Prangos species (Table 2). Therefore, it conrms the di erent chemical composition from P . pabularia . Recently, we reported that osthole was isolated from the chloroform extract of the roots of P . pabularia, and its structure was elucidated by spectroscopic means, resolution spectroscopy 22]. In addition, osthole was isolated from the hexane extract of the fruits of P . asperula [30]. Both osthole and suberosin were tolucensis var. multida volatile oil [ 45]. The essential oil with the high coumarin content showed moderate in-vitro antibacterial activity against representative Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria [ 45]. 115Appl. Sci. 2019 ,9, 2362 2.3. Antidiabetic Activity of Essential Oil and Isolated Compound (Osthole) The effect of the obtained essential oil and the pure compound (osthole) from P . pabularia roots for its in vitro inhibition of the enzyme PTP-1B was determined. The essential oil induced a PTP-1B enzymatic inhibition in a concentration-dependent manner with IC 50values 0.06\u00b10.01g/mL ( p<0.02), which is more than 25 times more potent than the positive control (3-(3,5-dibromo-4-hydroxybenzoyl)-2-ethylbenzofuran-6-sulfonic acid-(4-(thiazol-2-ylsulfamyl)- phenyl)-amide) with IC 501.46\u00b10.4g/mL ( p<0.05). The (osthole) also exhibited against PTP-1B, with IC 50values 0.93\u00b10.1g/mL ( p<0.01); it was also more eective than the positive control. The dose response curves of the inhibition of the PTP-1B enzyme of P . pabularia essential oil and osthole are shown in Figure 3. Wang and co-authors presented a strategy based on GC-MS coupled with molecular docking for analysis, identication, and prediction of PTP-1B inhibitors components of Himalayan cedar oil that inhibited PTP-1B with IC 50value 120.71\u00b10.26g/mL. The docking results of the PTP-1B inhibitory activity of caryophyllene oxide was also in agreement with its in vitro activity [ 46]. The IC 50value for PTP-1B inhibition for caryophyllene g/mL, respectively [ 48]. In another study, Bharti and co-authors reported the in vivo antidiabetic activity of Cymbopogon citratus (8.9%), and geraniol (8.5%), fully supported by molecular docking predictions [ 49]. Figure 3. Dose response curve the pure compound osthole (B) (IC 50=0.93\u00b10.01g/mL). Hong-Jen Liang investigated the hypoglycemic e ects of osthole in diabetic db /db mice, and the main mechanisms of these e ects were elucidated using an in vitro cell-based assay and in vivo assays using a diabetic db mouse model. Results that osthole signicantly alleviated hyperglycemia by activating PPAR /in a dose-dependent manner based on the results of the transition transfection assay [ 50,51]. Wei-Hwa Lee reported that the western blot analysis revealed osthole to signicantly induce phosphorylation of AMP-activated protein kinase acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) as well as increase translocation of glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) to plasma membranes and glucose uptake in a dose-dependent manner [ 50]. These results suggest that the increase in the AMP:ATP ratio by osthole had triggered activation of the AMPK signaling pathway, leading to increases in plasma membrane GLUT4 concentration and glucose uptake level [ 52]. Other research has clearly shown that osthole lowered fasting blood glucose (FBG) and improved insulin secretion. This may indicate partial recovery from pancreatic damage, as indicated from histological characteristics [ 53]. 116Appl. Sci. 2019 ,9, 2362 2.4. Molecular Docking A molecular docking analysis was carried out on the 12 most abundant components from the root essential oil of P . pabularia using the Molegro Virtual Docker program [ 54]. The MolDock \"rerank\" docking energies as well as the scaled molecular docking energies are summarized in Table 3. There are two ligand binding regions in human PTP-1B\u2014the catalytic site and an allosteric site (Figure 4). Nearly all of the ligands examined docked preferentially to the allosteric binding site in PDB 1T48, and the best docking ligand was osthole. In the allosteric binding site, the coumarin rings are located in a hydrophobic sandwich formed by Phe280 and Leu192 (Figure 5). Additionally, the aromatic residues Trp291 and Phe196 form face-to-edge interactions with the coumarin moiety. Ala189 and Glu276 surround the isopropylidene group of osthole. There are no apparent hydrogen-bonding interactions in the docked osthole in the allosteric binding site. A B Figure 4. Ribbon structure of human protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP-1B, PDB 1T48). The and the allosteric binding site ( B) are shown as green cross-hatched areas. The active site of PTP-1B is composed of highly polar residues, including Arg24, Lys41, Arg47, and Asp48, as well as the phosphate-binding loop, Cys215-Arg22 [ 55]. Therefore, the active site of PTP-1B is not a likely target for the hydrophobic essential oil components of P . pabularia . Nevertheless, the lowest-energy docked pose of osthole with the active site of PTP-1B (PDB 2HB1) has a scaled docking energy of 103.0 kJ/mol. This docking pose of osthole shows -stacking of the coumarin moiety with Phe182 and Tyr46 and is held close to the catalytic site residues of Cys215 and Arg221 (Figure 6). In addition, there are hydrogen-bonding interactions between the osthole carbonyl oxygen and the side chains of Lys120 and Arg221. 117Appl. Sci. 2019 ,9, parentheses) for Prangos 2362 Figure 5. The allosteric binding of human phosphatase 1B 1T48) with the lowest-energy docked pose of osthole. Figure 6. The active site of human protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP-1B, of osthole. Hydrogen-bonding interactions are indicated by the blue dashed lines. 119Appl. Sci. 2019 ,9, 2362 Ala and co-workers noted that \" ...the active site of PTP-1B possesses very few desirable drug-design features\" and that the highly charged portions of the active site \" ...signicantly increases the diculty of designing potent inhibitors with acceptable membrane permeability\" [ 55]. Thus, we conclude that the likely binding site for the P . pabularia essential oil components is the hydrophobic allosteric binding site, which is more consistent with the greater exothermic docking energies with the allosteric binding site (PDB 1T48, Figure 4B) than with the enzyme active site (Figure 4A). Furthermore, the docking energy for osthole is the most exothermic of the ligands examined, and this compound represents 6.0% of the essential oil composition. The most abundant component, 5-pentylcyclohexa-1,3-diene (44.6%), is a hydrocarbon, and although the docking energies are somewhat lower for the allosteric site than those for other essential oil components, the abundance of this compound may be a factor in the PTP-1B inhibitory activity of P . pabularia root essential oil. Wiesmann and co-workers pointed out that allosteric inhibitors \"...prevent formation of the active form of the enzyme by blocking mobility of the catalytic loop\" [ 56]. 3. Materials and Methods 3.1. Plant Material The roots of P . pabularia Lindl. were collected from the Yovon region (38 18/prime47/prime/primeN, 69 02/prime35/prime/primeE and 950 m above sea level) of Tajikistan in April 2017. The plant was authenticated by Doctor Farukh Sharopov, and the voucher sample (No. TAS 23659-1) was deposited in the herbarium of the Xinjiang Technical Institute of Physics and Chemistry Urumqi, Chinese Academy of Science. The air-dried sample was chopped into small pieces and hydrodistilled fo r3ht o give the yellow essential oil with 0.1% yield. Osthole was isolated from the roots of Prangos pabularia by silica gel column (100-200 (20:1) [ 22]. 3.2. Gas Chromatography The quantication of the essential oil of P . pabularia was carried out by gas chromatography using Kyoto, Japan) plus gas chromatograph, Phenomenex ZB-5 fused bonded column (30 m length \u00d70.25 mm inner diameter and 0.25 m lm thickness) and flame ionization detector (FID). Helium was the carrier gas, and the flow rate =1.5 mL/min with split mode. The following temperature program was used: Initial temperature 120C held for 2 min, temperature increased at a rate of 8C/min until 320C and then held for 10 min at 320C. Injector and detector and injector temperatures were 310C and 320C, respectively. GC Solution software (version 2.53, Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan) was used for recording and integration. The percentages of each component are reported as raw percentages based on peak area without standardization. 3.3. Gas Chromatographic-Mass Spectral Analysis Compound identication of P . pabularia essential oil was carried Agilent 6890 GC, Agilent 5973 (Agilent Technologies, Alto, CA, mass selective detector with electron ionization mass spectrometry (EIMS), (electron energy =70 rate with HP-5ms capillary column (30 m length \u00d7 0.25 mm inner diameter and 0.25 m phase thickness). Helium was the carrier gas with a flow rate of 1m L/min. Oven temperature program: Hold at 40C for 10 min, increase at 3C/min up to 200C, and then increase at 2C/min to 220C. The injector and the interface temperatures were 200C and 280C, respectively. A 1% w/vsolution of the essential oil in CH 2Cl2was prepared, and 1 L was injected with a splitless injection mode. Identication of the oil components was based on their Kovats indices determined by reference to a homologous series of n-alkanes and by comparison of their mass spectral fragmentation patterns with those reported in the literature (Adams 2007) and stored in the MS databases (NIST 17, WILEY 10, FFNSC versions 1.2, 2, and 3). 120Appl. Sci. 2019 ,9, 2362 3.4. NMR and HR-ESIMS Analysis NMR spectra were recorded on a MR-400 (400 MHz for1H and 100 MHz for13C) CA, USA) in CDCl 3. TMS (0.00) signal was used as an internal standard for 1H NMR shifts, and CDCl 3(77.160 ppm vs. TMS) signal used as a reference for13C NMR shifts. The HR-ESIMS data were collected with a QStar Elite mass spectrometer (AB SCIEX, Framingham, MA, Assay inhibition using pNPP ( p-nitrophenyl phosphate disodium salt) as the substrate. Both the essential oil sample and the enzyme were pre-incubated at room temperature for 5 min before use. A bu er solution (178 L of 20 mM HEPES, 150 mM NaCl, and 1 mM EDTA) was added to each well of a 96-well plate. The PTP-1B protein solution (1 L at a concentration 0.115 mg /mL) was added to the bu er solution, and then 1 L of the test solution and the positive control solution were added. The pNPP substrate (20 L of 35 mM) was added and mixed for 10 min. The plate was incubated for 30 min in the dark, and the reaction then terminated by adding 10 L of 3 M NaOH. The absorbance was then determined at 405 nm wavelength using a Spectra Max MD5 plate reader (Molecular Devices, USA). The system without the enzyme solution was used as a blank. Inhibition (%) =[(OD 405OD 405blank)/OD 405blank]\u00d7100. The IC 50 was calculated from the percent inhibition values. 3.6. Molecular Docking Molecular docking of PTP-1B with the major components found in P . pabularia root essential oil was carried out on the X-ray crystal structures from the Protein Data Bank (PDB): 1T48, The water molecules and the co-crystallized ligands were removed from the protein crystal structures. Molecular docking for the essential oil components with each of the protein structures was carried out using Molegro Virtual Docker, v. 6.0.1 (Molegro ApS, Aarhus, Denmark) as previously described [ 61]. A total of 12 major essential oil components were used in the docking study. The three-dimensional ligand structures were built using Spartan '18 for Windows, v. 1.2.0 (Wavefunction Inc., Irvine, CA, USA). For each docking simulation, a maximum of 1500 iterations with a maximum population size of 50 and 100 runs per ligand was carried out. MolDock re-rank scores were used to sort the poses generated for each ligand. In order to account for the bias toward high molecular weights, the following scheme was used: DS norm=7.2\u00d7Edock/MW1/3, where DS norm is the normalized docking score, E dock is the MolDock re-rank score, MW is the molecular weight, and 7.2 is a scaling constant to bring the average DS norm values comparable to E dock [62]. 4. Conclusions This study reports the chemical proles of the essential oils from the roots of P . pabularia containing 5-pentylcyclohexa-1,3-diene, menthone, 1-tridecyne, and osthole as major compounds. The high coumarin (osthole) content of the essential oil is particularly interesting in regard to the biological activities of the plant. Our investigations claried the use of essential oil from the roots of P . pabularia for the development of formulations based on enzyme inhibition of PTP-1B. Based on molecular docking, we conclude that secondary volatile metabolites (especially osthole) are likely responsible for the inhibition of PTP-1B. Furthermore, the experimental data are also in agreement with the computational investigation. The anti-diabetic activity of essential oil is related to the dominant volatile compounds, which may be acting synergistically. Further conrmation of anti-diabetic activity of the essential oil from P . pabularia needs more research e orts (especially in vivo antihyperglycemic activity), which may be applied in food, agriculture, and medicinal industries as a source of anti-diabetic agent. 121Appl.

Received: 17 February 2020; Accepted: 4 March 2020; Published: 7 March 2020 Abstract: Honey and propolis are natural substances produced by Apis mellifera that contain flavonoids, phenolic acids, and several other phytochemicals. The aim of this study was to phytochemically characterize three di erent types of honey and propolis, both separately and mixed, and to evaluate their wound-healing activity. Total phenolic compounds and flavonoids were determined using the Folin-Ciocalteu's and aluminum chloride colorimetric methods, respectively. The antioxidant activity was evaluated by both the DPPH free radical scavenging assay and -carotene bleaching test, and the anti-inflammatory activity was determined by a protein denaturation method. To evaluate the wound-healing activity of the samples, NHDF cells were subjected to a wound scratch assay. The obtained results showed that dark-brown honey presents a higher concentration of phenolic compounds and flavonoids, as well as higher antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities. Propolis samples had the highest concentrations in bioactive compounds. Examining the microscopic images, it was possible to verify that the samples promote cell migration, demonstrating the wound-healing potential of Introduction Honey is a natural substance produced by the western honeybee ( Apis mellifera ) from nectar and exudates of flowers and trees. Honey contains flavonoids, phenolic compounds, and numerous sugars in its composition, mainly glucose and fructose. It also contains small amounts of minerals, vitamins, proteins, and enzymes [ 1-5]. Propolis is a resinous substance produced by the same species of bees, being composed of wax, resinous secretions from plants, tree buds, pollen, and salivary enzymes. Propolis contains essential oils and organic compounds such as phenolic acids and flavonoids [ 4,6-8]. Similarly to honey, propolis also contains several minerals, vitamins, and enzymes [ 9]. This substance is used to protect the beehive, acting as a natural sealant, antiseptic, and embalming agent [ 1,4,6-8,10]. The color and flavor of both honey and propolis vary according to the plant species used in their production, health state of the bees, season, and the environmental conditions to which thebeehive is exposed [ 2-5]. The color of the honey can vary from deep brown to yellow, and propolis Appl. Sci. 2020 ,10, 1845 ; doi:10.3390 /app10051845 www.mdpi.com /journal/applsci 127Appl. Sci. 2020 ,10, 1845 can be found in variations of green, red, or brown [ 6,7,11]. Dierences in their composition result in dierent biological activities [ 1,4,7,12]. Honey and propolis have been used in traditional medicine for thousands of years mainly in burns and infected lesions [ 4,10]. Propolis was used primarily as an oral antiseptic and in dermal lesions. In ancient Egypt, propolis was also employed in mummication [ 6]. The main mechanism of action of honey derives from its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities [ 1,2,10]. The antioxidant potential of honey is due to the presence of phenolic compounds, namely gallic acid and flavonoids, that promote the free radical scavenging [ 2,10]. Its anti-inflammatory activity is associated with the ability to increase cellular proliferation, autolytic debridement, and to stimulate the immune system, reducing edema and pain [ 10]. Propolis has a higher content in flavonoids and phenolic acids than honey, which suggests that propolis should have a higher antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities [ 1,7]. Currently, an increasing interest in mixing propolis with honeys was veried, as products including propolis are already available on the market. The commercial achievement of these products is dependent of the level of acceptance and expectations of the consumers [ 1]. However, the potential benets of adding propolis to honeys is still to be scientically validated. Wounds are responsible for the consumption of large amounts of healthcare resources to ameliorate the quality of life of patients, and so they represent a considerable health challenge. Several scientic experiments have been performed to nd novel compounds that possess wound-healing properties, particularly from natural sources [ 13]. Honey was employed for the repair of battle wounds in both World War I and in modern history. The healing activity of honey in infected wounds was initially described in Europe and USA in mid-20thcentury [ 10]. Moreover, evidences suggest that propolis has therapeutic activity, through quantitative and qualitative analyses of collagen types I and III expression and degradation in wounds matrix, which suggests the favorable biochemical environment supporting re-epithelization of propolis [ 11]. The rst aim of this study was to phytochemically characterize di erent samples of honey and propolis together with mixtures of propolis extracts with honey in di erent concentrations, determining the contents in total phenolic compounds and flavonoids, as well as evaluating theantioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities. The second purpose of this work was to evaluate the in vitro wound-healing activity of the samples using normal human dermal broblasts (NHDF) by means of the scratch assay. 2. Materials and Methods2.1. Honey and Propolis Samples Honey and propolis samples were collected from a Langstroth beehive in a mountainous forest in the north central Portugal, specically in the region of Sabugal (Guarda) during September 2018 (GPS coordinates: 4023/prime33.5\" N 703/prime45.4\" W). Three dierent samples of honey and propolis were collected from the same beehive to maintain consistent the conditions of production. Each honey sample was collected from a di erent box inside the hive and was then ltered individually until there was no visible debris or particles. Propolis samples were scraped from the boxes and frames of the hive and then separated according to the box from which they were collected. All samples were stored individually in an appropriate sterilized container. Dark-brown honey was considered as Honey 1 (H1), red honey was labeled as Honey 2 (H2), and light-yellow honey was identied as Honey 3 (H3). Propolis samples were named according to the box from which the honey samples were collected as Propolis 1 (P1), Propolis 2 (P2), and Propolis 3 (P3). 2.2. Propolis Extracts The samples of propolis were grounded individually in a marble mortar at room temperature. To start the extraction process, 100 mL of ethanol (Scharlab, Spain) were added to 14 g of each pulverized propolis sample. The mixtures were left for 48 h under magnetic stirring at room temperature and in 128Appl. Sci. 2020 ,10, 1845 the absence of light. After 48 h, the mixtures were ltered and transferred to round bottom flasks to evaporate the ethanol using a rotary evaporation system at 45C. To ensure the complete evaporation, the round bottom flasks were kept in a vacuum oven for 24 h at 35C. The propolis extracts were labelled as Propolis Extract 1 (PE1), Propolis Extract 2 (PE2), and Propolis Extract 3 (PE3) and were frozen at 20C until they were used. 2.3. Mixtures of Honey with Propolis Each propolis extract was added in a concentration of 0.3% (w /w) and 0.5% (w/w) to the Honey 1 (the one that presented the best results), according to the previously published work dealing with the evaluation of the bioactive properties of honey with propolis [ 1]. The mixtures were prepared by weighting the corresponding amounts of honey and propolis and mixing them to complete 100 g of each mixture. To guarantee the complete homogenization, all mixtures were subjected to mechanical stirring, after which they were stored at 20C until further use. The mixtures were identied as Honey 1 followed by the corresponding Propolis Extract and percentage added resulting in Honey 1-Propolis Extract 1 (H1PE1), Honey 1-Propolis Extract 2 (H1PE2) and Honey 1-Propolis Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) FTIR was used to obtain spectra of the samples of honey, propolis and propolis extracts. These spectra were obtained with 64 scans and a 4 cm1resolution, between 4000 and 600 cm1using a Nicolet iS10 smart iTRBasic (Thermo Fisher Scientic, Waltham, MA, USA) model. 2.5. Phytochemical Characterization For the phytochemical characterization, all the samples were diluted with methanol (Scharlab, Spain).2.5.1. Total Phenolic Compounds Determination The phenolic compounds were determined by Folin-Ciocalteu's colorimetric method [ 14,15], using gallic acid as the standard. Initially, 450 L of distilled water were mixed with 50 L of each sample or gallic acid (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) solution. Then, 2.5 mL of Folin-Ciocalteu's reagent (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) (0.2 N) were added, being the mixtures left for 5 min before the addition of 2 mL of aqueous Na 2CO 3(Sigma-Aldrich, USA) (75 g /L). The reaction mixtures were incubated for 90 min at 30C. After incubation, the content in total phenolic compounds was determined by colorimetry at 765 nm [ 14,15]. A standard curve was prepared using methanolic solutions of gallic acid at 500, 300, 250, 200, 150, 100, and 50 mg/L( y=0.0010x; R2=0.9612). The total phenolic compounds content was expressed as g of gallic acid equivalents (GAE) /100 g of sample (honey, propolis, and mixtures of honey with propolis) [ 14,15]. 2.5.2. Flavonoid Determination The aluminum chloride colorimetric method was used to determine the flavonoids content according to a previously implemented method [ 14,15]. To 500 L of each solution, either the samples or the quercetin (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) (used as standard), 1.5 mL of methanol, 0.1 mL of aluminum chloride (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) 10% (w /v), 0.1 mL of 1 M potassium acetate (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) and 2.8 mL of distilled water were added. These solutions remained for 30 min at room temperature and then the absorbances were measured using a spectrophotometer (Helios-Omega, Thermo Scientic, USA) at 415 nm [ 14,15]. To construct the calibration curve, eight quercetin solutions were prepared in methanol with a concentration of 200, 175, 150, 100, 75, 50, 25, and 12.5 g/mL (y=0.0146 x; R2=0.9887). The flavonoids 129Appl. Sci. 2020 ,10, 1845 content was expressed as g of quercetin equivalents (QE) /100 g of sample (honey, propolis, and mixtures of honey with propolis) [ 14,15]. 2.6. Antioxidant Activity Evaluation For the antioxidant activity evaluation all the samples were diluted with methanol. 2.6.1. DPPH Free Radical Scavenging Assay The DPPH (2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl) scavenging assay was used to evaluate the antioxidant activity of the samples [ 16]. Briefly, to 100 L of each sample, 3.9 mL of a 0.1 mM DPPH (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) methanolic solution were added, being this mixture stirred until complete homogenization. The control solution consisted in 100 L of methanol with 3.9 mL of the DPPH solution. The reaction mixtures were kept at room temperature in the absence of light for 30 min, time after which the absorbances were read at 517 nm using a spectrophotometer (Helios-Omega, Thermo Scientic, USA) [ 16]. The percentage of inhibition (%Inhibition) of DPPH free radical by the samples was determined using the equation %Inhibition =[(Abs controlAbs ample )/Abs control ]\u00d7100, where Abs control corresponds to the absorbance of the control and Abs sample is the absorbance of each sample [ 14,15]. The results were expressed as %Inhibition /100 g sample (honey, propolis, and mixtures of honey with propolis). 2.6.2.-Carotene Bleaching Test The-carotene bleaching test was also employed to evaluate the antioxidant properties of the samples [ 16]. Firstly, a -carotene (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) solution in chloroform with a concentration of 20 mg/mL was prepared. To 500 L of this solution 40 L of linoleic acid (TCI Europe N.V ., Belgium), 400L of Tween 40 (Riedel-de H \u00a8aen, Germany) and 1 mL of chloroform (Scharlab, Spain) were added. This mixture was transferred to a round bottom flask and subjected to a rotary evaporation system at 45C to ensure complete evaporation of the chloroform. After this, 100 mL of water saturated with oxygen were added to the mixture, forming an emulsion. Secondly, 300 L of each sample were transferred to test tubes and 5 mL of the previously prepared -carotene emulsion were added. The tubes were stirred until complete homogenization and were placed in a water bath at 50Cf o r1h . Using a spectrophotometer (Helios-Omega, Thermo Scientic, USA), the absorbances of the samples were measured at 470 nm at the initial (t =0 h) and nal time (t =1 h). The antioxidant activity was determined as percentage of inhibition of -carotene's controlt=1h)]\u00d7100, where Abs control corresponds to the absorbance of the control and Abs sample is the absorbance of each sample [ 14,15]. The results were expressed as %Inhibition /100 g sample (honey, propolis, and mixtures of honey with propolis). 2.7. Assessment of In Vitro Anti-Inflammatory Activity The anti-inflammatory activity was determined by evaluating the capacity of the samples to inhibit protein denaturation [ 17]. Initially, a solution of bovine serum albumin (BSA) (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) at 1% (w/v) in phosphate bu er saline (PBS) solution was prepared. The pH of this solution was adjusted to 6.8 using glacial acetic acid (Scharlab, Spain). Then, 100 L of the samples diluted in methanol were mixed, in test tubes pre-heated at 37C, with 900 L of the BSA solution previously prepared. The control was composed of distilled water. The tubes were then incubated for 10 min at 72C and after this period cooled in ice for another 10 min. Finally, measurements of the absorbances were performed using a spectrophotometer (Helios-Omega, Thermo Scientic, USA) at 620 nm. The percentage ofinhibition of protein denaturation (%Inhibition) was determined applying the following equation, %Inhibition=100 [(Abs sample\u00d7100)/Abs control ], where Abs control corresponds to the absorbance of the control and Abs sample is the absorbance of each sample [ 17]. The results were expressed as %Inhibition/100 g sample (honey, propolis, and mixtures of honey with propolis). 130Appl. Sci. 2020 ,10, 1845 2.8. Evaluation of the In Vitro Wound-Healing Activity 2.8.1. Cell Culture Normal human dermal broblasts (NHDF) cell line was maintained in RPMI-1640 culture USA) supplemented with 10% fetal 1% /antimycotic (Sigma-Aldrich, USA), 0.01 M of HEPES (Sigma-Aldrich, USA), 0.02 M of L-glutamine (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) and 0.001 M of sodium pyruvate (Sigma-Aldrich, USA). Subsequently, the cells were incubated at 37C in an air incubator with a humidied atmosphere with 5% CO 2[18]. 2.8.2. Wound Scratch Assay The samples were tested for wound-healing activity by using the wound scratch assay [ 13,19]. NHDF cells were seeded in 12-well plates (4 \u00d7104cells/well) and cultured until a monolayer confluence was reached. After the adhesion of the cells, the medium was removed from the wells and the cell monolayer was scraped in a straight central line using a p200 micropipette tip, creating a scratch, with reference points being marked in the plates. The wells were washed with PBS to remove floating cells and cell debris. Then, the PBS was removed, the samples were prepared in RPMI-1640 and sonicated, then they were added to the wells. Supplemented RPMI-1640 culture medium was added to the control wells. After this, the plates were placed under a phase-contrast microscope and images were acquired at the initial moment (t =0 h). Then, the plates were incubated at 37C (5% CO 2) and examined once again under the microscope after 2, 24, and 36 h [ 13,19]. The size of the scratch zones was assessed manually using a digital image analysis tool (IC Measure software version 2.0.0.161) (The Imaging Source, Germany) that allowed the estimation of the distance between the injury margins. Using the IC Measure, the distance between the margins of the lesion in the control at 0 h was estimated, which was considered the initial one and was used to scale all other measurements to more easily compare the estimated distances of the injuries between the samples and the control. 2.9. Statistical Analysis The results were presented as mean values \u00b1standard deviation. To determine the reproducibility of the measurements, each assay was performed at least in triplicate. The calculated distance between the margins of the injury were analyzed using the statistical program IBM SPSS Statistics 25 (https://www.ibm.com/analytics/spss-statistics-software ) (IBM, Armonk, NY, USA). The signicant dierence among means was analyzed by Student's t-test (assuming the normal distribution of the continuous variables). A level of p-value<0.05 was considered signicant. 3. Results and Discussion3.1. FTIR Analysis of the Samples of Honey, Propolis, and Propolis Extracts Regarding the honey samples and given the flora that exists at the place of harvest, it is expected that Honey 1 was produced mainly during the autumn from species such as 2 was produced during the summer from flowers such as Rosa spp., Dahlia spp., Hydrangea spp., Honey 3 was produced during the spring, when most wildflowers and aromatic plants bloom samples subsequently collected did not show a direct correlation with the honey samples, because bees repair their hive continuously throughout the year, whenever this need arises, so the conditions under which propolis is produced will not necessarily be the same conditions under which honey is produced. 131Appl. Sci. 2020 ,10, 1845 The FTIR spectra of the samples of honey, propolis, and propolis extracts were recorded (Figure 1). Figure 1. FTIR spectra of the samples. The spectra of honeys show a water band at approximately 3300 cm1and 1650 cm1. Near 2900 cm1it is possible to observe a band that may be associated with groups present in amino acids. The bands between 1450 and 750 cm1may correspond to organic acids and to sugars commonly present in honey, such as sucrose, glucose, and fructose. Even though the honey samples have been produced in dierent seasons, they present quite similar spectra. The spectra of propolis samples show approximately the same bands but with great dissimilarity in terms of the intensity of the signal. In these spectra, it can be observed a water band at around 3400 cm1, and very pronounced bands at nearly 2900 and 2850 cm1that may correspond to some aliphatic compounds. The bands observed between 1650 and 1600 cm1, as well as the bands between 1550 and 1400 cm1may be caused by the presence of flavonoids and other aromatic compounds. The band at 1150 cm1may be due to the presence of hydroxyflavonoids. Some of the bands were not considered and may be related to wax and other debris present in the samples. The spectra of propolis extracts show approximately the same bands, but with lower intensity than the propolis samples. The water band observed in both propolis samples and extracts is less pronounced than the band registered in the honeys. In contrast, the bands identied as possible aromatic compounds and flavonoids in propolis samples and extracts spectra are more pronounced. Finally, the sugar bands in honey spectra are more evident and better outlined. The results now obtained are in agreement with other previously published results for other honey and propolis samples [ 20,21]. 3.2. Phytochemical Characterization Plant polyphenols present at least 8000 distinct known structures, being the most important class of natural bioactive compounds, which exhibit various biological activities [ 22]. Honey presents three classes of flavonoids with analogous structure: flavonols, flavones, and flavanones. Flavonoids are responsible for the color, taste, and flavor of the honey and they also improve its benecial health eects [ 22]. Furthermore, the floral sources used by bees to produce honey, whose predominance depends on seasonal and environmental issues, influences the phenolic composition and antioxidant activity of honey. The results of the phytochemical characterization of the samples regarding total phenolics and flavonoids contents are presented in Table 1. 132Appl. Sci. 2020 ,10, 1845 Table 1. Total phenolic compounds and flavonoids content of the samples. SamplesTotal deviation. Total phenolic compounds content of honey samples ranged from 0.029 to 0.107 g GAE /100 g sample, the values observed for propolis extracts ranged from 21.747 to 28.947 g GAE /100 g sample, and nally for the mixtures of honey with propolis ranged from 1.219 to 3.506 g GAE /100 g sample. The honey that presented the highest content in phenolic compounds is Honey 1 and the lowest content can be found in Honey 3. These di erences may be related with the di erent seasons in which the honeys were produced, as mentioned above. Propolis extracts showed a much higher concentration of phenolic compounds than honey samples, with the highest content found in Propolis Extract 1 followed by Propolis Extract 3 and Propolis Extract 2. An increase in phenolic content was observed with the addition of higher concentrations of propolis extracts to honey, and the highest value was obtained with H1PE3 at 0.5%. Flavonoids were almost absent from honey samples. The only one that presents flavonoids in its composition is Honey 1, but even this sample has a very low content. In contrast, the flavonoids determined in the propolis extracts ranged from 1.786 to 5.494 g QE /100 g sample, and in the mixtures ranged from 0.054 to 0.452 g QE /100 g sample. Propolis extracts showed a higher concentration of flavonoids than honey samples, with the highest content in Propolis Extract 1 followed by Propolis Extract 3 and Propolis Extract 2. An increase in flavonoid content was observed in all samples with the addition of higher concentrations of propolis extract to honey, as expected. The values of total phenolic compounds and flavonoids determined in the present work are very similar to the ones obtained for selected Czech honeys [ 23]. 3.3. Antioxidant and Anti-Inflammatory Activities Honey is an important natural source of antioxidants and has potential therapeutic value in several inflammatory diseases and in the treatment of heart disease, cancer, and cataracts, in addition to its sweetening capacity and lower glycemic load [ 24]. The biological properties of honey comprise antioxidant, antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, and wound-healing activities [ 24]. In this work, the antioxidant activity of the samples was evaluated by two di erent methods that measure distinct antioxidant properties (Table 2). The DPPH free radical scavenging assay is based on the capacity of the samples to scavenge free radicals, while the -carotene bleaching test allows the indirect evaluation of the capacity of the samples to inhibit the lipid peroxidation [ 25]. 133Appl. Sci. 2020 ,10, 1845 Table 2. Antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities of the samples. SamplesDPPH -Carotene Bleaching deviation. The honey that presented the highest antioxidant activity measured by the DPPH assay was Honey 1, opposed to Honey 3 that showed no relevant activity measured by this method. Propolis extracts revealed extremely high levels of antioxidant activity across all samples, with Propolis Extract 3 presenting the highest value. An increase in the antioxidant activity was observed in all samples with the addition of propolis extract to honey, however adding a higher concentration of propolis did not result in a considerable rase in activity in most cases. Concerning the results of -carotene bleaching test, the honey that revealed the highest antioxidant activity was once again Honey 1. The antioxidant activity of this honey measured by both methods is related with the presence of great amounts of phenolic compounds, as previously mentioned. Propolis extracts revealed high levels of antioxidant activity measured by -carotene bleaching test as it was also veried by DPPH assay. Analyzing the data obtained throughout the di erent assays it was possible to verify that dark-brown honey (H1) presented a higher content in phenolic compounds and flavonoids, followed by red honey (H2) and nally by light-yellow honey (H3). These results were consistent with the bioactive activity of the di erent samples. Since Honey 1 presented better phytochemical results, it was used in all the mixtures of honey with propolis. The anti-inflammatory activity was evaluated using an in vitro assay that studied the ability of the samples to inhibit protein denaturation using a BSA solution (Table 2). It was noted that propolis extracts reveal a higher anti-inflammatory activity than honeys. The honey that presented the highest activity was Honey 2, and among the Propolis Extracts, PE3 revealed the highest activity. Generally, an increase in the anti-inflammatory activity was observed in all samples when adding propolis extract to honey. In a previous work involving Malaysian honeys, the authors concluded that the anti-inflammatory activity may be attributed, at least in part, to the phenolic compounds [ 24]. 3.4. Wound-Healing Activity In the present study, NHDF cells were used in a scratch assay. Although all the preliminary characterization data showed that the propolis extracts always presented better results than the other samples under study, it was decided to also evaluate the wound-healing activity for all the samples including the mixtures of honey with propolis. It is already known that honey is not toxic against normal cells but is extremely cytotoxic to the tumor or cancer cells, as it was previously described [ 26]. Similar results were found in propolis extracts, which demonstrated cytotoxicity in human brosarcoma and colon adenocarcinoma cells while presenting no cytotoxic action in normal human skin broblasts [ 27]. By using the microscopic images, it was possible to evaluate the evolution of the gap created in the confluent cell monolayer in the presence of the samples (Table 3, Table 4, and Table 5). 134Appl. Sci. 2020 ,10, 1845 Analyzing the dierent images and comparing them to the control samples it is possible to say that the honey that shows better results after 36 h is Honey 2 (Table 3), while the propolis extract that presented better results was Propolis Extract 2 at 0.5% (Table 4); the best mixture is the honey with propolis\u2014H1PE3 0.3% (Table 5). Examining all the images, it is possible to observe that the cells continue alive when incubated with the samples. Moreover, it is clear that the samples promote cell migration, demonstrating the wound-healing potential of honey and propolis. Furthermore, by estimating the distance between the margins of the scratch (Table 6) the conclusions were the same. For all the samples, except for Honey 3 at 2 h, a signicant ( p-value<0.05) reduction of the scratch was observed when compared to the control at the same time of incubation. In general, the samples that showed the best results were the mixtures of honey with propolis. However, the sample that presented the maximum activity was the Propolis Extract 2 at 0.5%. Table 3.

Microscopic images obtained from the scratch wound-healing assay with the mixtures of honey with propolis (magnication: 100 \u00d7). Samples 2 h what was previously observed [ 1], in the present work the obtained results suggest that the e ect of combining propolis with honey is not synergistic but just the combined e ect of honey and propolis. This may be due to the chemical composition of each particular honey that will directly influence its bioactivities. In the honey samples now studied, the concentration in total phenolic compounds is relatively lower than in other samples of honey [ 1]. Moreover, flavonoids were not detected in the honey samples. These observations may explain the additive results observed for the mixtures of honey with propolis, suggesting the contribution of the propolis compounds to the biological activities. Considering all the obtained results, it is possible to verify that the samples that presented higher cell migration levels also presented higher bioactivity. 137Appl. Sci. 2020 ,10, 1845 During the inflammation process, honey promotes the release of inflammatory cytokines (TNF- IL-6, IL-1 , and NO) by monocytes, which might stimulate collagen synthesis by broblasts, playing important roles in the initiation and amplication of this process [ 10]. The modulation of the severity of inflammation can be associated with the anti-inflammatory properties of the polyphenols present in honey. Honey initiates an active but controlled inflammation but does not let the inflammation to develop in a chronic or exaggerated state, modulating the inflammatory phase of wound-healing [ 10]. The anti-ulcerous activity of honey and propolis can be attributed to flavonoids that can act alone or in combination with other compounds such as sterols, terpinens, saponins, gums, and mucilage [ 4]. A recently published paper, in which the potential wound-healing properties of propolis was evaluated, demonstrated that propolis promoted a marked increase in the wound repair capacity of keratinocytes [ 28]. It was also proved that the regenerative properties of propolis are mainly due to H2O2(which is extracellularly released and passes across the plasma membrane) is able to modulate intracellular mechanisms [ 28]. Table 6. Calculated distance between the margins of the injury. Samples 0h12h1p-Value 24 h1p-Value Indicates a signicant result ( p-value<0.05). 4. Conclusions This work demonstrated the biological potential of honey and propolis, particularly the wound-healing activity, which is related with their antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. Further studies should be performed to clarify the mechanism of action of honey and propolis by which cell migration is stimulated.

Here the most recent and impactful results of in vivo , preclinical and clinical studies involving a presented and discussed, along with some of their derivatives. In the authors' opinion, these compounds have been neglected compared to others, although they could be of great use in developing important new pharmaceutical products. The selected sesquiterpenes show promising anticancer and anti-inflammatory e ects, acting on various targets. Moreover, they exhibit antifungal, anxiolytic, analgesic, and antitrypanosomal activities. Several studies discussed here clearly show the potential that some of them have in combination therapy, as sensitizing agents to facilitate and enhance the action of drugs in clinical use. The derivatives show greater pharmacological value since they have better pharmacokinetics, stability, potency, and/or selectivity. All these natural terpenoids and their derivatives exhibit properties that invite further research by the Introduction Traditional or folk medicine relies heavily on the use of compounds-rich plants, like those of the Asteraceae family, of which many such species are commercially available in the form of herbal preparations. These are particularly rich in a wide range of natural terpenoids named sesquiterpene lactones [ 1] that, in some cases, are considered the active principles of such therapeutic plants [ 2]. Structurally speaking, sesquiterpene lactones are terpenes that have in common a basic structure of 15 carbons (thus the prex sesqui-) resulting from biosynthesis involving three isoprene units with a cyclical structure along with a fused -methylene- -lactone ring [ 3]. the cyclization Sci. 2020 4]. However, sesquiterpene lactones have very di erent chemical structures regarding the type and position of the substituents, as well as the size of the non-lactone ring [ 5,6]. For this reason, in structural terms, sesquiterpene lactones are organized into several subclasses:eudesmanolide (a 6 guaianolide and (with a 10-membered ring) and xanthanolide (containing a non-cyclic carbon chain and a seven-membered ring) [ 7,8] (Figure 1). Figure 1. Basic chemical structure of each of the sesquiterpene lactone subclasses: these subclasses have compounds that exhibit a wide range of biological activities. These range from antitumor [ 9] to [ 12,13]. Regarding the structure/activity relationship of these compounds, it appears that the -methylene- -lactone nucleus has a crucial role in almost all their observed biological e ects, such as cytotoxic, antitrypanosomal, and anti-inflammatory specic structural moieties of sesquiterpene lactone seem to influence their activity. For example, the presence of electrophilic sites associated with medium /high lipophilicity increase antimycobacterial activity, while a double bond exo to the cyclopentenone ring seems to favor anti-inflammatory activity [ 7,8,14]. The interaction of the ,-unsaturated cyclopentenone nucleus with the target depends largely on the geometry of the molecule, which is also a factor that influences the level of activity exhibited by sesquiterpene lactones [ 7,15]. Moreover, the number of alkylating groups in the structure of sesquiterpene lactones contributes to the level of activity they display, two groups being the optimal number [ 7,15]. The structure/activity relationship specific to each sesquiterpene lactone presented in this review will be discussed in detail throughout Section 2. Scientific evidence shows an action mechanism common to sesquiterpene lactones. The str act as alkylating groups on proteins found in cells through Michael addition, especially their thiol groups. They thereby a ect cell functionality, i.e., gene regulation, protein synthesis, and cell metabolism [ 15-17]. In recent years, the scientic community has already shown an oustanding growth of interest in the sesquiterpene lactones, largely due to the success of artemisinin\u2014one of the best known\u2014and the broad spectrum of activities exhibited by this compound's chemical family [ 18-20]. Thus, the high number of studies published concerning their isolation from new natural sources, total and semi-syntheticsyntheses, and evaluation of pharmacological potential, is not surprising. Natural sesquiterpene lactones exhibit poor pharmacokinetic properties due mainly to their low bioavailability, deriving from low solubility in water. As a result, in order to overcome these limitations, research interest in the synthesis of their derivatives has increased [ 21,22]. In addition, structural modication and synthesis has also allowed for an in-depth knowledge of their chemical properties, as well as the establishment of structure-activity relationships. 142Appl. Sci. 2020 ,10, 3001 In terms of health promotion, the applications of sesquiterpene lactones and their derivatives are a key research area. From this point of view, in vivo , preclinical and clinical studies are those that allow a more realistic assessment of their medicinal potential [ 23]. The literature on this topic is extensive, especially for the most successful compounds; however, studies on less known sesquiterpenes and their derivatives show that these compounds deserve more attention, since they could play an important part in future human health maintenance. Therefore, this review aims to point out the results of the most impactful and recent in vivo and (pre)clinical studies of these insuciently explored compounds and derivatives, which could be a valuable alternative in the development of new therapeutic drugs. 2. Sesquiterpene Lactones 2) was rst isolated from Inula helenium L. roots, and later was also found in other Inula species [ 24], as well as non- 2. Structure of alantolactone ( 1). Alantolactone ( 1) is obtained mainly by extraction and purication from natural sources, although its total synthesis is possible [ 27,28]. Modern laboratory techniques have resulted in a signicant increase in its extraction yield [ 29-31]. For example, ~3% pure alantolactone ( 1) yields were obtained from Inula helenium roots by Zhao et al. [ 30], which meant a signicant improvement over the ~1% yields from the roots of Inula magnica Lipsky [ 32]. Although alantolactone is associated with allergic contact dermatitis triggered by Inula species [ 33-35], this compound was rst described as anti-helminthic [ 36], with subsequent studies demonstrating its tremendous potential, mainly as antitumor [ 37-40], anti-inflammatory [ 26,41], and antioxidant [ activity, the e ect of alantolactone ( 1) on leukemia is well documented and was recently reviewed by Da Silva Castro et al. [ 43]. Xu et al. [ 44] reported a positive and signicant eect ( 1) on B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. In this study, 100 mg /kg (b.w.) doses were intravenously administered every two days in leukemia xenografted NOC /SCID mice. Results showed that treated mice lived an average of eight days more than non-treated mice (31.5 days after xenografting in treated compared to 23.5 days in non-treated mice), without signicant weight loss. Before this study, Chun et al. [ 45] had also reported an in vivo antitumor eect on triple negative breast cancer in mice. The researchers used only a 2.5 mg /kg (b.w.) dose every two days to treat athymic nude mice xenografted with MDA-MB-231 cells. In this assay, alantolactone ( 1) reduced tumor size by over half, and signicantly reduced tumor weight by about half after 24 days. Alantolactone ( 1) also exhibits in vivo activity against gastric cancer. Human gastric cancer cells (SGC-7901) were xenografted onto nude athymic mice, which were treated with 15 mg /kg (b.w.) of alantolactone ( 1) injected every two days 46]. Alantolactone ( 1) caused signicant tumor growth inhibition and reduced Ki-67 and Bcl-2 expression (tumor associated proteins), without signicant liver and kidney toxicity or impact on mouse weight [ 46]. Alantolactone ( 1) has also proven to be an especially potent sensitizing agent. In fact, it exhibits a synergistic eect with known chemotherapy drugs, such as oxaliplatin. Cao et al. [ 47] showed that a 10:2 mg/kg (b.w.) dose of alantolactone: oxaliplatin reduced tumor volume and weight by more than 143Appl. Sci. 2020 ,10, 3001 50% in athymic mice xenografted with colorectal tumor cells (HCT116). The anticancer e ect increased substantially when both compounds were used together, as opposed to alone. This result is in line with that obtained by He et al. [ 48], according to which, using a small weekly injected dose of 3 mg /kg (b.w.), tumor volume signicantly decreased by around 75% in xenografted pancreatic cancer cells (PANC-1), while increasing cancer chemosensitivity to oxaliplatin, revealing a synergistic action. Alantolactone's anticancer mechanism was also the main focus of several studies, some of them mentioned in recent reviews [ 49,50] The authors attribute its activity to the multiple pathways it activates. Alantolactone ( 1) acts as an alkylating agent leading to inhibition of key enzymes and proteins, and as an apoptosis inducer in cancer cells at mitochondrial level by interacting with cytochrome c. It promotes overproduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) due to specic caspase activation, by inhibiting autophagic deregulation, among other processes. Beyond its anticancer activity, compound 1also exhibits interesting anti-inflammatory activity. Ren et al. [ 51] used the DSS-induced colitis mouse model to test alantolactone ( 1) anti-inflammatory activity. A 50 mg /kg dose reversed colitis symptoms (bloody diarrhea, colon shortening and weight loss), besides signicantly reducing pro-inflammatory cytokine TNF- expression (to about half that of positive control) and IL-6 (by over 2.5 times compared to positive control) [ 51]. Wang et al. [ 41], showed that a 10 mg /kg (b.w.) dose of alantolactone ( 1) signicantly improved neurological function and reduced cerebral edema in a traumatic brain injury mouse model. This neuroprotective e ect was attributed to alantolactone's capacity to inhibit the NF- B inflammatory pathway and the cytochrome c/caspase-mediated apoptosis pathways [ 41]. To the best of our knowledge, no other authors have elaborated on this interesting double action: the fact that alantolactone ( 1) can simultaneously activate apoptotic pathways in cancer cells and inhibit these pathways in a cerebral edema model. Seo et al. [ 52] described the neuroprotective e ect of alantolactone ( 1) using amyloid 25-35- induced ex vivo neuronal cell death and scopolamine-induced amnesia in mouse models meant to emulate conditions common to neurodegenerative conditions like Alzheimer's disease. A 1 M alantolactone (1) treatment increased cortical neuron viability to almost baseline control readings, and 1 mg /kg (b.w.) signicantly decreased scopolamine-induced cognitive impairments. It is a interesting to note that this particular neuroprotective e ect is attributed to a drop in ROS levels. High ROS concentrations are associated with the neurodegenerative damage of Alzheimer's disease. Again, alantolactone ( 1) exhibits a double action: it raises ROS levels to induce apoptosis in murine models of neurodegenerative damage. The interesting advances with alantolactone ( 1) derivatives are also worth mentioning. Kumar et al. [ 53] assayed three of the 17 thiol derivatives synthesized, at 10 mg /kg (b.w.) doses, in mice showing that they have in vivo anti-inflammatory activity comparable to alantolactone ( 1). The novel compounds shared alantolactone's anti-inflammatory mechanisms. Another noteworthy study involving alantolactone ( 1) derivatives was published in 2018 by Li et al. [ 54], testing 44 derivatives for their ability to inhibit induced pulmonary brosis in mice. The results showed that 2 of these compounds are particularly active at 100 mg /kg (b.w.), reducing the brotic area by more than 60%. This is achieved by inhibition of the TGF- 1 pathway of myobroblast di erentiation. It should be noted that no toxic e ects were observed for either compound in the chronic toxicity test (seven days), using a dose of 2 g /kg (b.w.) administered orally. Finally, a patent involving an alantolactone ( 1) spiro-isoxazoline derivative was led in June 2019 (US patent N20190185487) for the development and production of these compounds that exhibit signicant anti-inflammatory activity. One factor which contributes to making alantolactone ( 1) very interesting as a future medicine is its low toxicity. In work by Khan et al. [ 55], Kunming mice treated with 100 mg /kg (b.w.) alantolactone (1) showed no signicant signs of hepatotoxicity or nephrotoxicity, in line with the previously cited work by He et al. [ 38]. This is especially important for alantolactone ( 1) as an anticancer drug, because it is well known that the liver and kidneys are particularly susceptible to negative side e ects from chemotherapy approaches [ 56,57]. 144Appl. Sci. 2020 ,10, 3001 Another engaging nding obtained by Khan et al. [ 55] is alantolactone's ability to cross the blood-brain barrier. It may thus become useful in the treatment of brain tumors or other conditions involving the central nervous system (CNS), since the blood-brain barrier is the greatest obstacle for drug delivery to those areas [ 58]. The metabolism and pharmacokinetics of alantolactone ( 1) have also been studied in vivo , with future pre-clinical testing in mind. Research shows that alantolactone ( 1) exhibits low absorption and is rapidly eliminated after intravenous and oral administration. Its metabolism involves conjugation with thiol, and ,-unsaturated carbonyl is the preferential site. The low aqueous solubility of alantolactone ( 1) causes low oral bioavailability [ 59-61]. All these recent reports show there is great interest in alantolactone ( 1), and that it has potent proven in vivo activities, mainly several di erent types of anticancer activity. This broad-spectrum activity, combined with its synergistic action with known cancer therapy agents, shows alantolactone (1) has great potential for future drug development. However, further research is necessary, especially clinical trials, to identify its intracellular action sites and secondary targets and thereby elucidate its mode of action. 2.2. Arglabin Arglabin ( 2) (Figure 3), is a guaianolide sesquiterpene lactone with the chemical formula C15H18O3, isolated from several species including Artemisia myriantha Kar. and Kir. species [ 65] where the extraction yield was 0.27% [ 66]. Fortunately, several synthetic and hemisynthetic methods for preparing compound 2 have been reported [ 66-70], allowing it to be provided in the quantities necessary for research and medicinal applications. Figure 3. Structure of arglabin ( 2). The arglabin ( 2) molecule contains a 5,7,5-tricyclic ring structure with contiguous stereo centers [ 70]. Furthermore, it contains both an epoxide and an ,-unsaturated Michael acceptor, two functional groups that have important roles in its pharmacological activities [ 71]. There are many research lines advancing towards more e ective drugs on the basis of the arglabin ( 2) molecule. New arglabin ( 2) derivatives have been obtained by chemical modication, the most successful being obtained via amination followed by treatment with gaseous hydrochloric acid. This converts arglabin ( 2) into the hydrochloride salt of the dimethyl amino adduct, which is very soluble in water [ 66,72]. This arglabin (2) salt form was used in the therapy of several cancer types such as breast, lung, liver and esophageal tumors in oncological clinics of Kazakhstan [ 73-75]. Treatment of an esophageal carcinoma patient with compound 2 contributed to a signicant reduction in tumor volume, favoring its regression and a lower incidence of leucopenia [ 75]. In terms of mechanism of action, arglabin ( 2) inhibits farnesyl protein transferase enzyme influences DNA synthesis murine P388 lymphocytic leukemia cells [ 74]. Recently, Schepetkin and co-authors [ 76] have reported that compound 2inhibits T-cell receptor activation movement ERK1/2 [GSH] cells. The anticancer e ect of Arglabin ( 2) was also demonstrated by He and colleagues [ 77]o n xenografted oral squamous cell carcinomas. They elucidated that tumor growth is inhibited via 145Appl. Sci. 2020 ,10, 3001 downregulation of relevant protein expression in the mTOR /PI3K/Akt signaling pathway and impairment of mitochondrial membrane potential, leading to apoptosis. Recently, the pharmacokinetic properties of arglabin ( 2) have been reviewed [ 72], highlighting that it mainly accumulates in the liver, quickly reaches peripheral tissues and penetrates the blood-brain barrier. Furthermore, according to the literature, arglabin ( 2) has no described adverse e ects, since it does not aect normal liver and kidney function or cause local irritative /allergenic reactions, nor mutagenic or ( 2) demonstrated vivo anti-arthritis activity in a rat model. Arglabin ( 2) lowers the levels of inflammatory mediators and cytokines, and reduces expression of NF-B (nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells), suggest that arglabin ( 2)i s a compound with great potential in inflammation and atherosclerosis therapy. Using a high-fat diet ApoE2.Ki mouse model, experimental results [ 80] showed that arglabin (2) reduces inflammation by decreasing IL-1 and IL-18 levels and increases autophagy apoptosis [ 81]. Studies carried out with arglabin ( 2) show its potential for developing new anticancer and /or anti-inflammatory drugs, the main limiting factor being its low bioavailability. The preparation of soluble active versions of compound 2, and /or new delivery systems may attract further interest in this sesquiterpene lactone. 2.3. Costunolide Costunolide ( 3) (Figure 4), has the same chemical formula as alantolactone ( 1)( C 15H20O2). It is a member of the germacranolide subclass and was rst isolated from Saussurea costus (Falc.) Lipsch. roots in 1960 [ 82]. It present in many Asteraceae genera such as Inula [24],Lactuca and Helianthus [83], but also those from other families like Magnoliaceae [ 84]. Figure 4. Structure of costunolide ( 3). Biosynthesis of costunolide ( 3) is well documented and occurs through the mevalonate pathway [ 85]. Briefly, the process starts with the cyclization of farnesyl pyrophosphate, forming germacrene A. Next, the isoprenyl side chain of germacrene A undergoes hydroxylation by germacrene A hydroxylase, followed by oxidation to germacrene acid. It is nally synthesized after oxidation and cyclization of germacrene acid [ 85]. Some species are rich sources of costunolide ( 3), such as essential oil of Saussurea lappa roots (yield ~3%), of which 52% was ( 3)[86]. The total synthesis of costunolide ( 3) has been described using di erent methods/strategies [ 87-89]. In a recent review [ 90], Kim and Choi detail the activities of custonolide ( 3) and discuss its therapeutic potential. Like alantolactone ( 1), compound 3also exhibits anticancer bioactivity against dierent cancer cells via various routes. In fact, it acts as an apoptosis inducer, cell cycle regulator, angiogenesis and metastasis inhibitor and can also reverse the drug resistance mechanism [ 91]. There are several recent publications describing in vivo costunolide ( 3) studies, such as the work by Jin et al. [ 92] on costunolide's anticancer e ect on osteosarcoma xenografted mice. Results showed a daily 20 mg/kg (b.w.) dose was enough to signicantly reduce tumor weight by about half, as well as reduce the number of lung metastases to around one third of that in the control group. Western blot analysis of the tissues revealed this e ect could be attributed to costunolide ( 3) inhibition of STAT3 transcription, a factor that is widely known to be linked to oncogenesis and cancer proliferation [ 93]. 146Appl. Sci. 2020 ,10, 3001 It is interesting to note the similarity between previously mentioned STAT3 inhibitory activity by alantolactone ( 1)[45]. To highlight another similarity, costunolide ( 3) also exhibits activity against gastric adenocarcinoma in xenografted mice [ 94]. Results from this study showed costunolide ( 3) induced caspase-mediated mitochondrial apoptosis in cancer cells and a 50 mg /kg (b.w.) dose on alternate days signicantly reduced tumor size to about half. It achieved very similar results tothe positive control cisplatin, a chemotherapeutic agent used in clinical treatment [ 94]. Interesting to note is costunolide's anticancer e ect through telomerase reverse transcriptase inhibition [ 95], a mechanism not known in alantolactone ( 1). As reported by the researchers, a 5 mg /kg (b.w.) dose injected on alternate days in glioma xenografted mice signicantly reduced tumor size by over 50%. This inhibition was associated with reduced telomerase activity, which leads to ROS-associated apoptosis [ 95]. A subsequent work by the same research group also showed the same dose a ects lipid metabolism in glioma xenograft tumors, by lowering expression of FASN, SREBP-1, and PGC-1 [96], which are key genes targeted for cancer treatment [ 97-99]. Beyond costunolide's anticancer e ect, it has also proven to be a potent anti-inflammatory agent [ 90], as well and antioxidant [ 91]. Its anti-inflammatory action has been well documented in vitro [84,100] and in vivo , appearing to be linked to NF- B pathway inhibition [ 101]. For example, costunolide ( 3) is able to suppress inflammatory angiogenesis [ 102], alleviating gastric ulcers [ 103], and acute lung and liver damage [ 104-107]. Recently, studies have shown that costunolide ( 3) also exhibited anti-osteoarthritic e ects [ 108]. In fact, treatment in rats with osteoarthritis causes attenuation of cartilage degeneration compared to the control osteoarthritic group. The observed e ect has been attributed to the inhibitory action of this compound on the Wnt /-catenin and NF- B signaling pathways, and on the expression of matrix metalloproteinases [ 108]. Costunolide ( 3) seems to be also a powerful antiasthmatic [ 109]. In this work, the researchers treated asthma-induced mice with 10 mg /kg (b.w.) before an immune challenge. Results showed a 61.8% inhibition of asthma-associated eosinophil increase, as well as signicantly reducing lung inflammation scores and mucin production [ 109]. Recently, it has been shown that costunolide ( 3)i sa neective inducer of hair growth in mice [ 110]. For this assay, the researchers implanted mouse dermal cells, treated with 3 mM costunolide ( 3) for two days. Results showed a 2.5-fold increase in induced hair follicles in the implanted treated cells, and topically applied costunolide ( 3) signicantly and visibly improved hair growth. The authors claim this might be due to activation by compound 3of key follicle-cell cycle pathways, including the Wnt/b-catenin, Shh/Gli, It is worth mentioning the TGF- /Smad pathway was also mentioned in previous studies related to anti-inflammatory action of costunolide ( 3)[106]. Costunolide ( 3) derivatives have also proven to be highly interesting, with remarkable in vivo eects. In recent work by Cala et al. in an agro-research context [ 111], many dierent functional groups were added to the sesquiterpene backbone, yielding, among others, two amino and two methyl ether derivatives with strong herbicidal activity. The etiolated wheat coleoptile assay indicated treatment with these costunolide ( 3) derivatives had dose-dependent growth inhibition responses equivalent to a widely used synthetic herbicide used as positive control. These results show there is potential for some of these derivatives as bio-herbicides, but further studies are necessary. There was also another interesting result of this work which the authors did not address, but is worth pointing out: two tested thiol derivatives boosted coleoptile growth instead of inhibiting it, with one compound increasing coleoptile length by ~30% with a 30 M treatment. The general implication of these results is that costunolide ( 3) modication can be powerful and versatile, capable of yielding diametrically opposed bioactive compounds depending on the functional group added. In conclusion, costunolide ( 3) is a highly multitalented and potent bioactive compound. Similar to other sesquiterpene lactones such as the previously discussed alantolactone ( 1), much of its potential for future drug development lies in its anticancer and anti-inflammatory e ects. It is interesting that there appears to be more work done with costunolide ( 3) derivatives than alantolactone ( 1) derivatives, 147Appl. Sci. 2020 ,10, 3001 which in general suggests greater interest of the scientic community in costunolide ( 3) as opposed to alantolactone ( 1). With so many relevant publications in 2019 alone, we expect to see costunolide ( 3) research ramping up to a pre-clinical stage very soon. 2.4. Cynaropicrin Cynaropicrin ( 4) (Figure 5) is a guaianolide type sesquiterpene lactone with a chemical formula of C19H22O6and a 5,7,5 fused tricyclic skeleton [ 112]. Figure of cynaropicrin ( ( Cynara scolymus L.) in 1960 for the rst time [ 113] and later it was found in C ynara cardunculus L. [114,115] and Cynara scolymus L. species [ 116], being considered as a chemotaxonomic marker for artichoke plant species [ 112]. Cynaropicrin ( 4) was also found in many species family such as others [ 112]. Yields of cynaropicrin ( 4) extraction from Cynara cardunculus L. leaves using ethanol, ethyl acetate, dichloromethane and water were 56.9, 37.5, 40.3 and 13.6 mg /g dry weight, respectively [ 125]. The biological activities of cynaropicrin ( 4), as with other sesquiterpenic lactones, are related to its pharmacophore -butyrolactone ring [ 112]. There are many studies reporting on the important pharmacological activities of cynaropicrin ( 4), and plants rich in ( 4), such as antitumor, anti-inflammatory, antitrypanosomal, and antihepatitis C virus, among many others. Due to these notable eects, cynaropicrin ( 4) will be suitable for the development of medicinal compounds [ 123]. Cynaropicrin ( 4) is the rst natural product that in vivo potently inhibits the African trypanosome diseases [ 126]. Using the acute model of mice infected with Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense STIB 900, when treated with two doses of 10 mg /kg (b.p.) per day, on the 7thday after infection, there was a 92% reduction in parasitemia when compared to the untreated group. Additionally, selectivity indices of 7.8 were obtained for cynaropicrin ( 4) against L6 cells of rat myoblasts [ 127]. The action mechanism is still under study to date, but is thought to be related to the interaction of compound 4with the trypanothione redox system in T rypanosoma brucei [127]. However, Da Silva et al. [ 128] demonstrated that cynaropicrin ( 4) at a dose of up to 50 mg /kg (b.w.) per day has no e ect in mice infected with Trypanosoma cruzi , in either Y or Colombiana strains. The synthesis and semi-synthesis of several cynaropicrin ( 4) derivatives allowed the structure /antitrypanosomal activity of these compounds to be evaluated. It was concluded that the -methylene- -lactone structure is indispensable to maintain the biological eect, whereas 3-OH and 19-OH derivatization does not change the activity and some types of side-chain promote the selectivity of the compound [ 129,130]. The in vivo evaluation of some derivatives, using the Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense acute mouse model, indicated that the dimethylamino derivative exhibits much less toxicity than cynaropicrin ( 4), but also less activity [ 129]. Cynaropicrin ( 4) also showed the ability in vivo to delay the eects of skin photoaging, promoting the proliferation of melanocytes and keratinocytes, by acting as inhibitor of NF-kB transcription activity [ 148Appl. Sci. 3001 2.5. Helenalin lactone that belongs to the pseudoguaianolide subclass. It is very abundant in Arnica montana L. but is also identied in other species from Arnica and Helenium genera Centipeda minima (L.) 132-136]. Figure 6. of helenalin ( 5). Alcohol extracts containing helenalin ( 5) and its derivatives have been used as a staple of traditional herbal anti-inflammatory medicine for many decades [ 134]. For instance Arnica montana L. solutions are used to treat rheumatism, arthritis, inflammation, hematoma, soreness, sprains, swelling and muscle spasms from athletic activity etc., seasonally triggered arthritis, arteriosclerosis, angina pectoris, postoperative conditions, and joint pain. The plant is used externally in creams, alcoholic tincture, and ointment form but also taken highly diluted in homeopathic remedies [ 134]. Many such preparations, even hair oil and shampoo, are commercially available from a range of suppliers in healthfood shops and pharmacies almost worldwide [ 137]. Likewise, clinical trials have aimed to assess topical Arnica applications, regarding possible reduction of laser-induced minor hematomas and osteoarthritis-type symptoms. Orally administered homeopathic formulations are also widely employed in the clinical setting to treat and manage conditions such as carpal tunnel, slow knee-surgery recovery, tonsil and pain, etc. [ 133]. Helenalin ( 5) inhibits NF- B transcription of inflammatory cytokines, which have an essential role in both inflammation and cancer [ 138]. It also eciently inhibits cancer cell proliferation through a variety of action modes, e.g., telomerase inhibition [ 139], DNA and protein synthesis attenuation, apoptosis induction and promoting reactive oxygen species generation [ 140]. It is noteworthy that inhibition of NF- B activation associated with another sesquiterpene, helenin, occurs in T-cells, B-cells and epithelial cells in response to four di erent stimuli, nullifying kB-driven gene expression. Since this activity does not a ect transcription factors Oct-1, TBP , Sp1 or STAT 5, this NF- B activation is probably inhibited selectively [ 141,142]. Lyss et al. [ 141] described how helenalin modies the NF- B/IB complex, preventing I B release. They proposed a molecular action mode for the anti-inflammatory influence, which is dierent from other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as aspirin indomethacin. p65, ablating DNA-binding [ inhibiting 5-lipoxygenase and leukotriene C4 synthase activities [ 144]. Experiments performed by Schr\u00f6der al. [ 145] demonstrate that compound 5inhibits platelet aggregation induced by collagen, 5-hydroxytryptamine secretion and thromboxane formation, depending its on concentration (between 3-300 M). They concluded that helenalin inhibits platelet function via interaction with platelet sulfhydryl groups in a way most likely associated with reduced phospholipase A2 activity. Helenalin ( 5) inhibited complete Freund's adjuvant-induced and carrageenan-induced paw edema in the rat [ 146]. Topical application of Arnica 3D gel (10%), combined with a 10 mA microcurrent for 2 min also signicantly improved wound healing in a linear incision wound model in the rat back [ 147]. The evidence was consistent with a higher percentage of mature collagen bers and a signicantly larger total number of cells in the wound, as assessed by structural and morphometric analysis. According to this, di erent proportions of Arnica montana extracts alone or 149Appl. Sci. 2020 ,10, 3001 combined with other plants have been patented for their therapeutic potential [ 137]. Widrig et al. [ 148] performed a randomized, double-blind study in 204 patients with osteoarthritis (OA) to compare the eects of ibuprofen (5%) and Arnica montana gel (50 g tincture /100 g) containing helenalin (5), 11,13-dihydrohelenalin and its ester. The results show that short-term use, up to three weeks, of Arnica gel improves pain and hand function in OA, indistinguishably from ibuprofen gel. Substantial antiosteoarthritic activity by blocking transcription factors NF- B and NF-AT is attributable to helenalin and derivatives. Boulanger et al. [ 149] demonstrated that helenalin ( 5), intraperitoneally delivered at 20 mg /kg in lactating-Balb/C mice 9 and 3 h prior to infection, reduced intracellular growth of Staphylococcus aureus in mouse mammary glands This suggests the compound interferes with host molecular mechanisms and not directly with Staphylococcus aureus growth. The authors conclude helenalin might be worth investigating as a potential treatment for Staphylococcus aureus -induced mastitis in bovine species. There is however some concern regarding this treatment, mainly regarding helenin persistence in the animal's milk, and whether or not the therapeutic doses pose short- and long-term toxicity risks. It is therefore imperative to further study and characterize its safety and pharmacological properties. Valan et al. [ 150] showed that helenalin ( 5) has a signicant biphasic positive inotropic e ect on the myocardium of guinea pigs at doses of 105-103mol. Nevertheless, concentrations above 103mol. cause an irreversible negative inotropic action leading to a blocking of muscle contraction. The skin is susceptible to environmental damage by multiple agents, particularly solar ultraviolet (UV), which induces skin hyperpigmentation disorders. Expression of heat shock proteins (HSPs, particularly HSP70) is receiving consideration in the eld of cosmetics, to reduce skin damage and signs of aging. Usui et al. [ 151] isolated AM-2 (helenalin 2-methylbutyrate) from Arnica montana as a good inductor of HSP70, with low cytotoxicity. Treatment of cultured mouse melanoma cells with AM-2 or Arnica montana extract up-regulated the expression of HSP70 in a dose-dependent manner. It also activated the transcription factor for hsp genes, i.e., heat shock factor-1. They concluded that both Arnica montana extract and AM-2 are likely to show benecial e ects if incorporated in hypopigmenting cosmetics. Acute liver injury is a life-threatening syndrome frequently associated with hepatocyte damage and characterized by oxidative and inflammatory responses. Li et al. [ 136] recently observed that intragastric administration of helenalin ( 5) for 10 days signicantly ameliorated hepatic injury induced previously in mice with LPS/D-GalN. These results were evidenced by the attenuation of histopathological changes and the decrease in serum aminotransferase and total bilirubin activities. Therefore, helenalin ( 5) shows a hepatoprotective e ect against damage induced by LPS /D-GalN. This in turn may be associated with reduced hepatocyte apoptosis, by protection of mitochondrial function and oxidative stress inhibition by Nrf2 pathway activation, as well as attenuating inflammation by inhibiting NF- B activation. The co-authors of that study [ 152] submitted Patent No. CN 110283151 in 2019 as a method for isolation of helenalin from Centipeda minima and its application for treating hepatic brosis and inflammation. Furthermore, the same authors [ 153] patented it for inhibiting hepatic stellate cell activation, showing the advantages of reducing collagen deposition and synthesis of inflammation-related proteins, promoting death of stellate cells, and its application in liver brosis treatment. 2.6. The guaianoline-type sesquiterpene communis (Apiaceae) and described to be the Inula viscosa (L.) Ait. [ 154]. Inuviscolide ( 6) inhibited in vivo inflammation in mice, as shown in the investigation performed by Hern \u00e1ndez et al. [ 155]. The authors used inuviscolide ( 6) and ilicic acid from Inula viscosa that compound 6influenced cell degranulation and leukotriene biosynthesis, as well as neurogenic drive and glucocorticoid-like interactions. During the testing, ear and paw edema were induced in Swiss female mice using phorbol esters ethyl phenylpropiolate (EPP), and phospholipase A2 serotonin, respectively. The drug dose was applied topically in the ear models but as 150Appl. Sci. 2020 ,10, 3001 subcutaneous or intraperitoneal injections in the paw models. leukotriene B4 (LTB4) formation, high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) was performed on rat peritoneal neutrophils. The results showed that compound 6reduced PLA2-induced edema with an ID 50of 98mol/kg. The results did not indicate that glucocorticoid response modiers had an influence on the edema induced by serotonin. In intact cells, inuviscolide ( 6) resulted in reduced generation of LTB4 (IC 50value of 94M). The overall results indicated that compound 6has an important role in the anti-inflammatory activity of Inula viscosa , being more active than ilicic acid. The action mechanism was suggested to be related to an interference with leukotriene synthesis and to PLA2-induced mastocyte release of inflammatory mediators [ 156]. Figure 7. Structure of inuviscolide ( 6). 2.7. Lactucin and Its Derivatives Lactupicrin, and Other compounds from the guaianolide subclass are lactucin ( 7)( C derivatives lactupicrin ( 8) and lactucopicrin ( 9), (Figure 8). Dolej et al. [ 156] and Ruban et al. [ 157] had previously described the chemical structure of lactucin ( 7). These compounds are distributed within Asteraceae like Lactuca serriola [158], especially plants contain lactucin ( 7) and lactucin-related substances [ 159-164]. The content depends largely on the species, variety and the part of the plant analyzed. In fact, lettuce guaianolide content was high and reached concentrations between 61.7 mg /mL and 147.1 mg /mL in its latex [ 160] and 2.9 mg/g to 36.1 mg/g in the overall plant, expressed as dry weight [ 162]. Figure 8. Structures of lactucin ( 7) and its derivatives lactupicrin ( 8) and lactucopicrin ( 9). The biological activities of lactucin ( 7) and lactucin-related compounds had already attracted interest at the end of the 19th century, as they were credited to be responsible for the bitter taste and pharmacological e ect of lactucarium or lettuce opium [ 165]. This is the condensed latex of wild lettuce Lactuca virosa . This dried exudate was used in Europe for centuries with similar applications to opium as an analgesic, antitussive, and sedative [ 163]. Due to its widespread use, it was described and standardized in the United States Pharmacopoeia (USP) and the British Pharmaceutical Codex as a sedative for irritable cough and as a mild hypnotic for insomnia [ 166-168]. Lactucopicrin ( 9) and lactucin ( 7) were identied as its major active compounds, although compound 7was suggested to be one of the main metabolites related to the sedative and the sleep-promoting e ects [ 163]. In an in vivo study in mice, both substances were conrmed to be analgesics, with an activity equal to or greater 151Appl. Sci. 2020 ,10, 3001 than ibuprofen. In addition, when lactucin ( 7) and lactucopicrin ( 9) were administered to mice on the hot plate, both compounds were revealed to have analgesic and sedative e ects at concentrations of 15 and 30 mg/kg, respectively. Furthermore, in a spontaneous locomotor activity test, these compounds were active at concentrations of 30 mg /kg [168]. Although the pure compounds currently are not easily available on the market, several lettuce extracts and seed oils containing these sesquiterpene lactones as main active compounds are commercialized, e.g., Sedan\u00ae(Pharco Pharmaceutical Company, Egypt). The sedative e ects were addressed in the pilot study by Yakoot et al. [ 169]. The authors investigated if lettuce seed oil was ecient and safe to treat patients with sleep disorders. The results showed that the seed oil of L. sativa was a potentially hazard-free agent, able to reduce sleeping di culties and alleviate mild to moderate forms of anxiety in geriatric patients, without showing side e ects [ 169,170]. Additionally, the study performed by Kim et al. [ 163] examined the sleep-inducing and sleep-prolonging e ect of four lettuce varieties. The seed and leaf extracts were evaluated using a four-week-old ICR mouse model to analyze their eects on pentobarbital-induced sleep. The results showed that both extract types lengthened sleep duration and signicantly reduced sleep latency at both evaluated doses of 80 mg /kg and of 160 mg/kg [163]. Although these studies in patients were performed with plant extracts reported to contain lactucin ( 7) and its derivatives as principal active pharmacological compounds, they conrm that their application for treatment of anxiety and sleep disorders is worthy of further evaluation. Additionally, the results showed that these sesquiterpenes might be assessed as potential alternatives to currently used sleep-promoting, sedative, and anxiolytic agents, with their and addiction-potential. 2.8. Parthenolide Parthenolide ( 10) (Figure 9) has the same chemical formula as inuviscolide ( 6)( C 15H20O3) and is the best known sesquiterpene lactone in the germacranolide class. It was isolated for the rst time from feverfew leaves and flowerheads ( Tanacetum parthenium (L.) (Sch.Bip.), a plant known in traditional Chinese medicine for centuries to treat various ailments. Among them, it is used to relieve fever, pain of dierent etiologies such as migraine and rheumatoid arthritis and even to treat insect bites [ 171]. Figure 9. Structure of parthenolide ( 10) and its derivatives DMAPT ( 11) and HMPPPT ( 12). Compound 10has been applied as an anti-inflammatory through specic inhibition of the signal proteins IKK2, STAT3, and MAPK, along with the activity and expression of many inflammatory mediators including COX, which is involved in the NF- B mediated proinflammatory signal transduction pathway [ 172]. It also exhibits antitumoral activity by proliferation inhibition in various cancer cell types, including prostate, pancreas, cervical, breast, lung, colorectal, glioblastoma, multiple myeloma, and leukemia [ 8,173]. There are numerous reviews describing the outstanding anti-inflammatory and antitumor activities of parthenolide, its analogs, and derivatives upon di erent pathways in human cancer cells [ 8,174-178]. Parthenolide ( 10) has a multitarget action mechanism. It triggers EGF receptor phosphorylation, interferes with AP-1 [ 179] and the signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) [ 180] activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) [ 181]. Furthermore, the molecular mechanisms of parthenolide action are strongly associated with DNA-binding inhibition of two transcription factors 152Appl. Sci. 2020 ,10, 3001 NF-B[182,183], as well as the proapoptotic activation of p53, along with reduced glutathione (GSH) depletion [ 184]. Parthenolide rapidly induces ROS generation 185,186], and lowers histone deacetylase activity (HDAC) [ methyltranspherase [ 188]. Additionally, parthenolide can interfere with microtubule function through tubulin binding [ 189]. Recent advances regarding in vivo therapeutic applications of parthenolide ( 10), mainly focused but not limited to anticancer and anti-inflammatory activities, are discussed below, together with the synergistic eects and toxicity of compound 10and some derivatives. One of the advantages of parthenolide ( 10) is its cancer stem-cell selectivity while remaining non-cytotoxic to non-tumor cells [ 190,191]. In this case, the molecular mechanism of parthenolide involves induction of apoptosis through mitochondrial and caspase signaling pathways, and also an increase in the cytosolic concentration of calcium, cell cycle arrest, and inhibition of [ 178,192]. Cholangiocarcinoma (CC) is an intrahepatic bile duct with due chemoresistant. Parthenolide induced oxidative stress-mediated apoptosis in CC cells and Bcl-2-related family of proteins modulated that susceptibility [ 193]. Moreover, intraperitoneal injection of parthenolide at 4 mg /kg caused signicant inhibition of tumor growth and angiogenesis in the xenograft model [ 194]. Recently, Yun et al. [ 195] demonstrated that low concentrations of parthenolide (5-10M) suppressed HO-1 enhancing Ro317549 through inhibition Nrf2 translocation. The e ects of parthenolide (10) and Ro at 2.5 mg /kg on tumor growth were tested using a xenograft nude mouse tumor model with subcutaneously implanted ChoiCK and SCK cells. This assay indicated that their combined application more e ectively inhibited cancer cell growth inhibition as compared to treatment with either compound by itself. Furthermore, the e ect of parthenolide on the development of colitis-associated colon cancer (CAC) was investigated using a murine model of azoxymethane (AOM) /dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) induced CAC. This study showed that parthenolide administration ( 10) at 2 and 4m g/kg can signicantly inhibit the inflammation-carcinoma sequence and be crucial in experimental CAC regulation. The mechanism of action involves decreased NF- B p65 expression levels blocking phosphorylation and subsequent degradation of B-inhibitor (I B)[196]. The authors conclude that parthenolide ( 10) could be a novel chemopreventive agent for CAC treatment [ 196]. Oral cancer is one of the ve most common cancers worldwide. Chemoprevention is a new approach to cancer research, focusing more on the prevention, suppression, and reversal of thecarcinogenic process by the use of natural plant products and /or synthetic chemical compounds. Thus, Baskaran et al. [ 197] tested the reduced the nefarious histopathological changes. In addition, the parthenolide treated group showed signicant improvement regarding antioxidants, lipid peroxidation. Glioblastoma, or glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), is the most aggressive type of brain cancer and is very dicult to treat. Nakabayashi and Shimizu [ 198] examined the eect of compound 10 on tumor growth using a xenograft mouse model of glioblastoma, administering it intraperitoneally (10 mg/kg/day) for 22 days. It signicantly inhibited the growth of transplanted glioblastoma cells with respect to the control group. Zhang et al. [ 199] demonstrated that a high parthenolide dose (8 mg /kg/day) impedes initiation of experimental autoimmune neuritis (EAN), an animal model for peripheral nervous system acute inflammatory disease. This is achieved by parthenolide suppressing TNF- , Th1 cells in the early stages. Although this anti-inflammatory eect is short-lived, compound 10also suppresses late-stage recovery of EAN models, along with inhibiting the apoptosis of inflammatory cells. Such results suggest that parthenolide is not suitable for nervous system autoimmune disease treatment. Nitric oxide (NO) plays a key role in the etiopathology of central nervous system (CNS) diseases like multiple sclerosis (MS). It has been proposed that inhibition of NO synthesis could prove a relevant 153Appl. Sci. 2020 ,10, 3001 mechanism of action in treating multiple sclerosis and migraine. Accordingly, Fiebich et al. [ 200] investigated the e ect of parthenolide ( 10) on iNOS synthesis and NO release using primary rat microglia. The results indicated that compound 10prevents iNOS/NO synthesis and inhibits the activation of p42/44 mitogen-activated kinase (MAPK), but not IkB degradation or NF-kB p65 activation. These results show parthenolide may be a potential therapeutic agent in the treatment of CNS diseases. Mechanisms of axon regeneration and optimal functional recovery after nerve injury are key to in higher animals. However, insu cient growth rates of injured axons often lead to incomplete peripheral nerve regeneration. Gobrecht et al. [ 201], demonstrated that a single parthenolide injection at 5 nM into the injured sciatic nerve or its systemic intraperitoneal application was already enough to signicantly increase the number and length of regenerating axons in the distal nerve at three days post-lesion. This application of parthenolide ( 10) appears to act on the great instability of microtubules in promoting axonal growth, at least in the CNS [ 174]. For this reason, the e cacy of parthenolide is very promising for a therapeutic promotion of nerve regeneration, since compound application and recurrent treatments are facilitated, compared to invasive local nerve injections [ 202]. Pulmonary brosis (PF) in general and idiopathic pulmonary brosis (IPF) in particular, is a disease for which there is no e ective therapy. In vivo studies have shown that parthenolide ( 10), via intragastric inhibited the NF- attenuating bleomycin-induced pulmonary brosis. Moreover, there were signicant improvements in body weight and other pathological changes associated with this disease [ 203]. NF-B has been associated with the cardiovascular system; in fact, its function is related to the protection of cardiovascular tissues against injuries. However, its activation can also contribute to tissue pathogenesis, depending on the type of cells in which it is activated [ 204]. It is known that myocardial infarct size could be reduced up to 60% by antagonizing NF- B activity [ 205]. To achieve this, parthenolide ( 10) at 250 or 500 mg /kg (b.w.) was administered intraperitoneally before reperfusion in rats, and caused a signicant improvement in myocardial injury, with a reduction in the oxidative and inflammation state, consequently reducing infarct size [ 206]. However, Tsai et al. [ 207] reported that a prolonged treatment in bEND.3 cells a ected Ca2\u00fe signaling in the endothelial cells that regulate vascular tone; therefore, care should be taken on using this compound in experimental designs and clinically. Parthenolide ( 10) has relatively poor pharmacological properties, derived from its low solubility in water and consequently reduced bioavailability, which limit its potential clinical use as anticancer drug. To increase its solubility, a series of parthenolide derivatives were obtained by diastereoselective addition of several primary and secondary amines to the exocyclic double bond [ 208,209].N,N- Dimethylaminoparthenolide (DMAPT) ( 11) (Figure 9) was selected as a leader compound according to its pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic and bioavailability properties [ 209,210]. When formulated as a fumarate salt, DMPAPT is 1000-fold more soluble in water than parthenolide and maintained the anticancer activity because, DMAPT ( 11) is rapidly converted back to parthenolide in body fluids ( 10). Recently, molecular studies indicate that DMAPT has a similar action to parthenolide [ 192,211-213]. DMAPT has approximately 70% oral bioavailability and induces rapid death of primary human leukemia stem cells (LSCs) from both myeloid and lymphoid leukemias and is highly cytotoxic to bulk leukemic cell populations. Pharmacological studies carried out by Guzman et al. [ 210] using both mouse xenograft models and spontaneous acute canine leukemias demonstrate in vivo bioactivity. Indeed, DMAPT eliminates human AML stem and progenitor cells without harm to normal hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells, and eradicates phenotypically primitive blast-crisis chronic myeloid leukemia (bcCML) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cells. Moreover, it inhibited metastasis in a mouse xenograft model of breast cancer and enhanced the survival of treated mice [ 210]. DMAPT was assayed in a phase I trial against acute myeloid leukemia (AML), acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and other blood and lymph node cancers [ 12,176]. However, a year later the clinical trials were suspended [ 214]. 154Appl. Sci. 2020 ,10, 3001 Radiotherapy is widely used in cancer treatment; however, the benets can be reduced by radiation-induced damage to neighboring healthy tissues. Morel et al. [ 215] demonstrated in mice that DMAPT ( 11) selectively induces radio-sensitivity in prostate cancer cell-lines, while protecting primary prostate epithelial cell lines from radiation-induced damage. Compound 11 has the advantage of being well-tolerated orally without the need to adjust the administration time to radiation exposure. Radiation-induced lung brosis is considered a critical determinant for late normal tissue complications. Therefore, the same group [ 216] examined the radioprotective e ect of DMAPT ( 11) on brosis in normal tissues, according to the image-guided fractionated radiotherapy protocols used clinically. The results obtained show that DMAPT reduced radiation-induced brosis in the corpus cavernosum of the rat penis (98.1%) and in the muscle layer around the bladder (80.1%), and also the tendency towards reduced collagen inltration into the submucosal and muscle layers in the rectum. They concluded that DMAPT could be useful in providing protection from the radiation-induced side e ects such as impotence and infertility, urinary incontinence and fecal urgency resulting from prostate cancer radiotherapy [ 216]. On the other hand, radiation-resistant prostate cancer cells often overexpress the transcription factor NF B. Mendonca et al. [ 217] suggest that DMAPT might have a potential clinical role as radio-sensitizing agent in prostate cancer treatment. This conclusion is based on the nding thatcombined treatment of PC-3 prostate tumor xenografts with oral DMAPT and radiation therapy signicantly reduced tumor growth, when compared to those treated with either DMAPT or radiation therapy alone. Li et al. [ 218], obtained a novel parthenolide bioavailability and pharmacological properties than DMAPT. In vitro studies pointed to compound 12as the most promising derivative, from safety prole and ADME property standpoints. The newly identied compound was shown to have pro-oxidant activity and in silico molecular docking studies with components of the NF- B pathway also supporting a pro-drug mode of action. This mechanism included release of parthenolide and covalent interaction with one or more proteins involved in that pathway [ 218]. The in vivo oral bioavailability study of compound 12 in murine PK at 10 mg/kg indicated that it has advantageous pharmacological properties and therefore can be considered an agent to be considered in therapy against drug resistant chronic lymphocytic leukemia [ 218]. In the last few years, nanotechnology has provided many selective strategies for the detection and treatment of cancer, overcoming the problems associated with conservative cancer diagnosis and therapy. In this context, the development and testing of parthenolide ( 10) nanoencapsulation and derivatives is a way to enhance its potential to provide e ective pharmaceutical products for clinical use and resolve drawbacks such as low bioavailability [ 219-222]. Accordingly, several patents for elaboration of parthenolide and its derivatives in nanocarriers, and various pharmaceutical preparations combined with other products, have been recently registered in parthenolide has been suggested for use in combination therapy with other anticancer agents, to overcome obstacles in the treatment of cancer, such as a) di erent types of cancer cells, b) resistance to chemotherapy, and c) drug toxicity to normal cells. TRAIL (tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-related apoptosis inducing ligand) is now being developed as a promising natural immunity-stimulating molecule for clinical trials in cancer patients. However, various malignant tumors are currently resistant. Kim et al. [ 223] investigated how parthenolide ( 10) sensitizes and HCT116 (TRAIL-sensitive) cells were treated with compound 10and/or TRAIL. The results revealed that parthenolide ( 10) increases induced apoptosis and upregulates DR5 protein level and surface 155Appl. Sci. 2020 ,10, 3001 expression in both cell lines, suggesting that combined therapy with TRAIL is a good strategy to overcome the resistance of certain CRC cells. Pancreatic cancer is a common malignancy with high occurrence worldwide, and a poor survival rate. Recent research indicates that combination therapy with DMAPT ( 11) can enhance the antiproliferative e ects of gemcitabine in pancreatic cancer cells in vitro and in vivo [224]. Yip-Schneider et al. [ 225] showed that cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2) inhibitor) at 50 mg /kg/day combined with DMPTA at 40 mg /kg/da has a signicant inhibitory e ect on tumor invasion of adjacent organs and metastasis in pancreatic cancer induced in Syrian golden hamsters. It reduced NF B activity, and expression of prostaglandin E2 and its metabolite. They also demonstrated that compound 11 (40 mg/kg/day) in combination with sulindac (20 mg /kg/day) and gemcitabine (50 mg /kg twice weekly) can delay or prevent progression of premalignant pancreatic lesions) in a genetically engineered mouse model of pancreatic cancer [ 226]. Likewise, they demonstrated that DMAPT ( 11) (40 mg/kg/day) with gemcitabine (50 mg /kg/day) considerably improved average survival, lowering the frequency and multiplicity of pancreatic adenocarcinomas. This combination also signicantly reduced tumor size and the incidence of metastasis into the liver [ 227]. Parthenolide exerted a cytotoxic e ect on MDA-MB231 cells, a triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cell-line, however its success is scarce at low doses. In order to overcome this di culty, Carlisi et al. cytotoxic e ect of parthenolide ( 10). It is noteworthy that treatment with parthenolide alone increased the survival of cell pathway Akt /mTOR and the consequent nuclear translocation of Nrf2, a protein regulating the expression of antioxidant proteins that protect against the oxidative damage triggered by injury and inflammation, while treatment with SAHA alone activated autophagy. A phase 2 clinical trial indicated that actinomycin-D (ActD), a polypeptide antibiotic that intercalates to DNA and inhibits mRNA transcription in mammalian cells, could be a potent drugagainst pancreatic cancer. However, it is not a good candidate due to toxicity issues. Thus, given the modes of action of DMPTA and Actinomycin-D (ActD), Lamture et al. [ 229] postulated that combining drugs would result in synergistic inhibition of Panc-1 pancreatic cancer cell growth, since the activity of DMAPT on FkB would enhance apoptosis induction by ActD, through phosphorylation of c-Jun. Indeed, the combination of these two drugs produced a higher cell-death percentage than each drug alone. 2.9. Thapsigargin In 1978, the structure of thapsigargin ( 13)( C 34H50O12) (Figure 10) was elucidated [ 230] for the rst time. It was found as the main component of Thapsia garganica L. [230,231], an umbelliferous Apiaceae species distributed in the Mediterranean area. This plant has long been used in folk medicine for treating common lung diseases (acute bronchitis and pneumonia) and dental pains [ 232]. The resin from Thapsia garganica root was described in the French Pharmacopoeia [ 232]. Thapsigargin ( 13) yield ranged between 0.2-4.91% of the dry weight of leaves and roots ofThapsia garganica and depends on the plant tissue, collection site (locality) and extraction methods [ 231,233]. For example, classical maceration was more e cient than other methods such as microwave-assisted extraction or simple extraction with liquid nitrogen [ 233]. Due to the importance of thapsigargin's biological activities, there is great interest in its synthetic and semi-synthetic preparation, thus several studies have been published on this subject [ 234,235]. Thapsigargin ( 13) is an calcium ATPase (SERCA) pump. The blockage of the SERCA pump results in malfunction of cellular calcium homeostasis and exerts a critical role in normal cell metabolism, leading to apoptosis [ 236,237]. Moreover, this sesquiterpene lactone causes apoptosis at all stages of the cell cycle. 156Appl. Sci. 2020 ,10, 3001 Figure 10. Structure of thapsigargin ( 13) and its derivative mipsagargin ( 14). Compound 13strongly inhibited all the subtypes of SERCA. The inhibitory constants (Ki) of thapsigargin ( were 1.3, and 12 nm SERCA2b, and SERCA3a, respectively [ 238,239]. Its anity with the SERCA1a pump is signicantly reduced by removal of the acyl groups at O-3, O-8 and O-10 [ 240]. Thapsigargin ( 13) possesses interesting pharmacological properties; instance, it induces expression of the L-histidine decarboxylase enzyme responsible for converting L-histidine to histamine in cells [ 241]. It also evokes ROS generation in cells through calcium-ion mediated changes (mitochondrial depolarization), which can result in cell dysfunction and damage [ 242,243]. In addition, compound 13is known for its cytotoxic action against di erent cancer for 244], 100value is 0.8 mg/kg in mice [ 249]. Zhong et al. [ 250] proposed that thapsigargin causes vomiting by triggering the cell-stress inducer thapsigargin (0.3 mg /kg) protects against experimental sepsis in male KM (Kunming) mice [ 237]. Thapsigargin ( 13) is widely used as an experimental tool for endoplasmic reticulum stress inhibition and the discovery of new active therapeutic derivatives [ 232,251]. A new thapsigargin ( ( 14) (Figure 10), has been developed for anticancer therapy, notably for the treatment of prostate cancer. Mipsagargin ( 14) has the ability to link the C-8 with prostate-specic membrane antigen (PSMA) peptide. It is a brand new example of a thapsigargin prodrug, which is currently undergoing preclinical evaluation as a targeted chemotherapeutic agent with selective toxicity against cancer cells [ 232,249]. Mahalingam and coauthors reported that mipsagargin ( 14) has an acceptable pharmacokinetic prole in patients with solid tumors [ 252]. It is relatively well tolerated, promoting prolonged disease stabilization in patients with advanced liver cancer [ 253]. 2.10. T omentosin Tomentosin ( 15) (Figure as xanthalongin, is a xanthanolide sesquiterpene lactone with the same chemical formula as inuviscolide ( 6) and parthenolide ( 10)( C 15H20O3). It has been isolated from plants such as Dittrichia [ 254,257].Inula viscosa was widely used as a medicinal plant. A steam distilled extract of its leaves and flowers yielding 2% of tomentosin ( 2020 ,10, 3001 Figure 11. Structure of tomentosin ( 15). The biological activities of tomentosin ( 15) have been addressed in several studies focused on anticancer, antifungal, and insecticidal activities. Anticancer activity observed in vitro tests was conrmed by in vitro andin vivo studies performed by Bar-Shalom et al. [ 259]. The authors found that application of an aqueous extract of Inula viscosa leaves at a concentration of 300 g/mL to colorectal cancer cells induced apoptosis, through activation of caspases. During the subsequent in vivo study, mice transplanted with MC38 cells were treated intraperitoneally with the extract at concentrations of 150 and 300 mg /kg. The results indicated that tumor weight and volume were reduced signicantly by this treatment after comparison with the untreated control group. Furthermore, staining the para n section of the tumors showed inhibition of cell proliferation, as well as induction of apoptosis. Interestingly, side e ects, which often include weight loss, impact on fur, and changes in behavior or kidney or liver functions, were not observed. This suggests that the extract was non-toxic at the concentrations applied. However, this remains to be conrmed [ 259]. Fungal infection of grapevines causes severe economic damage to grape producers. As several fungicide-resistant strains of the pathogens have developed, efective fungicide application is becoming more and more di cult. Therefore, natural products such as sesquiterpene lactones and plant extracts may provide alternatives to current synthetic fungicides. The antifungal activity of six Inula viscosa leaf extracts on downy mildew under eld conditions was addressed in the study performed by Cohen et al. [ 260]. This mildew is caused by the fungus Plasmopara viticola (Berk. and Curt.). The results established that the e ective concentration of oily paste extract in water required to control 90% of the treated shoots in the eld was lower than 0.125%. For whole vines, the required concentrationranged between 0.30% and 0.37%. Additionally, the results did not appear to depend on seasonal fluctuations. The evaluated leaf extracts contained 10.6% of tomentosin ( 15) and 10.6% of costic acid, which were identied as the active principles with antifungal activity. The overall results indicated that Inula viscosa extracts can be of great value as an alternative source for non-synthetic fungicidal preparations to treat downy mildew infestations of grapes [ 260]. In an in vivo investigation performed by Ahern et al. [ 261] on insecticidal activity, the e ect of the stereochemistry of the lactone ring on feeding behavior of the herbivorous polyphagous grasshopper Schistocerca americana (Drury) was addressed. Schistocerca americana is locally related in the south of the U.S. to signicant damage to crops when temporary mass populations occur. To evaluate the antifeedant activity of diastereomeric sesquiterpene lactones, the study focused on tomentosin ( 15) with a cis-conguration and the corresponding isomer xanthinosin with a trans -conguration. The results showed both compounds were able to reduce plant consumption by the insects. However, the trans -fused compounds were consumed less than the corresponding cis-fused compounds. The results of this study not only permitted conclusions on the importance of the stereochemistry-dependence of diastereomeric sesquiterpene lactones for insecticidal activity, but also might help to understand the geographical distribution and evolution of di erent clades among the Asteraceae family. The distribution of cis- and trans -fused compounds within plants of this family is still not fully understood, in this study, 12.5% of the sampled Asteraceae genera [ 261]. 158Appl. Sci. 2020 ,10, 3001 3. Conclusions Taking into account the research described above, the sesquiterpene lactones dealt with in this review have proved to be very useful compounds with promising anticancer and anti-inflammatory bioactivities in particular. For instance, alantolactone ( 1) was shown in vivo to be able to reduce tumor size by over 50%, while increasing life expectancy and reducing pathological indicators across several dierent cancer types. In addition, synergistic e ects with well-known cancer therapeutics were also reported. Arglabin ( 2) in salt form could be used to treat several cancers and possesses valuable pharmacokinetic characteristics highly sought for in therapeutic drugs. It has no adverse e ects described in the literature. Antitrypanosomal, antitumor and anti-inflammatory activities are reported for cynaropicrin ( 4). Another compound, helenalin ( 5), inhibits essential factors in both cancer and inflammation, i.e., the NF- B pathway and the transcription of inflammatory cytokines. Inuviscolide (6) demonstrates potential as an anti-inflammatory therapeutic compound, being able to reduce rat ear and paw edema and LTB4 generation in intact cells. Lactucin ( 7) and derivatives lactupicrin ( 8) and lactucopicrin ( 9) have a strong potential as phytopharmaceutical agents for treatment of anxiety and sleep disorders, being the main active components of long commercialized substances, e.g., Sedan\u00ae, without observing side-e ects. Of all the sesquiterpene lactones reviewed in this work, parthenolide ( 10) and its derivatives DMAPT ( 11) and HMPPPT ( 12) are those most mentioned in the literature, with several studies particularly reporting their excellent anti-inflammatory and antitumor activities. Some work reveals synergistic eects of these compounds with current anticancer drugs, favoring more potent and selective antitumor action. Parthenolide derivatives have been designed and DMAPT ( 11) is 1000-fold more soluble in water than the natural product, while maintaining a similar mechanism of action with improved anticancer and anti-inflammatory activities. Thapsigargin ( 13) has the particular capacity to cause endoplasmic reticulum stress and thus cell apoptosis, an interesting pharmacological property to be retained or potentiated in derivatives aimed at anticancer therapy. An example is mipsagargin ( 14), which is currently undergoing preclinical evaluation for selective toxicity against cancer cells in tumor sites, with minimal side-e ects for the host. Another active compound is tomentosin ( 15), additionally with potential applications in cancer but also as antifungal and antifeedant. In summary, given the activities described in this review these sesquiterpene lactones exhibit properties that justify more research by the scientic community, to drive preclinical and clinical studies leading to development of new drugs.

Rosmarinic acid (RA) is a caeic acid ester and a naturally-occurring phenolic compound in a number of plants belonging to the Lamiaceae family, such as Rosmarinus ocinalis (rosemary) from which it was formerly isolated. RA intervenes in carcinogenesis through di erent ways, including in tumor cell proliferation, apoptosis, metastasis, and inflammation. On the other hand, it also exerts powerful antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and even antidepressant, anti-aging e ects. The present review aims to provide an overview on anticancer activities of RA and to deliberate its therapeutic potential against a wide variety of diseases. Given the current evidence, RA may be considered as part of the daily diet in the treatment of several diseases, with pre-determined Sci. 2019 1. Introduction Rosmarinic acid (RA) is an ester of ca eic acid and 3,4-dihydroxyphenyl lactic acid that occurs in nature as phenolic compounds. Its molecular formula is C 18H16O8and is formally known as (R)--[[3-(3,4-dihydroxyphenyl)-1-oxo-2 E-propenyl]oxy]-3,4-dihydroxy-enzenepropanoic acid (Figure 1). The main sources of RA are plants belonging to the Boraginaceae family, subfamily Nepetoideae. It was isolated for the rst time in 1958 from the rosemary plant ( Rosmarinus ocinalis L.), and recently it plants belonging to Lamiaceae family [ 1]. Figure 1. Chemical structure of rosmarinic acid. RA has remarkable biological e and some rosemary extract-isolated compounds, like carnosic and ursolic acids and carnosol have also shown to be able to reducethe likelihood of tumor development in several body organs, such as stomach, colon, liver, breast, and leukemia cells [ 2-4]. Thus, here we review the various therapeutic potentials of RA in this article. 2. Bioavailability of Rosmarinic Acid and Its Metabolic Changes in the Human Body RA is partially metabolized to the coumaric acid and ca eic acid in the body of the rat [ 5], and the hypolipidemic eect of RA may also be a consequence of the action of its metabolites. For example, caeic acid inhibited the synthesis of acid synthase, CoA obese and serum estradiol concentrations in rats with estrogen deciency, which may have contributed to the observed metaboliceects [ 7]. In the rat ovary ovulation, external ovarian tissues such as fatty tissue, skin, bones and brain are the source of estradiol. In these sites, C19 cannot be synthetized. Steroids C19 (androgens) can be converted to estrogens by aromatase. Therefore, it seems possible that RA or its metabolites increase the activity of aromatase. Ca eic acid increased estradiol and reduced total cholesterol concentrations only in rats that were fed standard food containing soy, and these e ects were not observed in rats fed without soy with reduced phenolic acid contents [ 8]. It is therefore possible that at least some of the RA eects reported depend on the diet. RA showed similar benecial e ects on some lipid parameters and insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) as that demonstrated for sinapic acid in a parallel study [ 7]. Moreover, RA had positive e ects on expression of hepatic genes or proteins involved in signaling insulin and glucose and lipid metabolism, such as insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1), 5/primeAMP-activated 1 (CPT1) in diabetic rats [ 9]. The possible mechanism of action of RA on glucose and lipid metabolism may be mediated by peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) peroxidation; RA has been shown to activate these receptors. It should be noted that the lower RA dose (10 mg /kg) was sucient to reduce the HOMA-IR index and the concentration of fructosamine, while a higher dose (50 mg /kg) was required to reduce the total cholesterol and 174Appl. Sci. 2019 ,9, 3139 triglyceride levels in rats with estrogen deciency. Moreover, RA and its metabolites can directly neutralize reactive oxygen species (ROS) [ 10] and thereby reduce the formation of oxidative damage products. The antioxidant activity of RA directly derives from its structure, namely the presence of 4 hydrogens in the phenolic system and two catecholic moieties, which give this compound polar character. Electrochemical studies have shown that RA oxidizes in two steps. In the rst step, the rest of the caeic acid is oxidized and in the second step the residue of 3,4-dihydroxyphenyl lactic acid. Figure 2. Rosmarinic acid and its potential functions. RA is therefore considered to be the strongest antioxidant of all hydroxycinnamic acid derivatives [ 11]. Inhibition of the production of advanced glycation end products under the influence of RA was previously presented in vitro and in vivo [12]. The use of RA in doses of 10 and 50 mg/kg in rats with estrogen deciency did not a ect the body mass. RA administered at a dose of 10 mg/kg of ovariectomized rats did not a ect estradiol and progesterone concentrations compared with ovariectomy control rats, whereas RA at a dose of 50 mg /kg of estradiol showed a trend of growth. Orchids containing RA are often used in self-healing and daily diets, so it is possible to consume 5-10 g of these plants daily in the form of infusions and spices [ 13]. RA is water-soluble, and according to literature data, the e cacy of secretion of this compound in infusions is about 90% [ 14]. Accordingly, it is possible to consume approximately 110 mg RA daily, i.e., approximately 1.6 mg /kg for adult men weighing 70 kg. Increasing the concentration of reduced glutathione (GSH) in plasma due to the use of RA was previously described in various models of diabetes [ 15]. RA has been shown to stimulate the regulation of the catalytic subunits of the glutamate cysteine ligase (the enzyme involved 2019 in the biosynthesis of GSH) in the hematopoietic stem cells [ 16]. It can be assumed that the increase in the concentration of GSH, after the administration of RA, was previously the result of the intense biosynthesis of GSH rather than its recovery from the oxidized form. Moreover, it should be noted that the RA appears to be absorbed into the rat mainly as its metabolites [ 5]. It is possible that these metabolites also play a role in the observed increase in GSH concentration. Furthermore, serum GSH/oxidized glutathione (GSSG) was calculated, as it is known to be an important indicator of redox cell status as well as for the state of redox at the tissue and whole body [ 17]. The adventitious e ect of RA on redox homeostasis has been shown to increase the ratio of GSH /GSSG in serum rats. 3. Health Benets of Rosmarinic Acid3.1. Anticancer Potential Several mechanisms have been proposed for RA anticancer activity (Figure 3). For instance, in rats with colon cancer, RA at the concentration of 5 mg /kg body weight (b.w.) impaired tumor formation and development, reduced lipid peroxidation by-products and pro-apoptotic proteins expression, modulated xenobiotic enzymes, and increased apoptotic proteins expression [ 18]. In human liver cancer cell line, HepG2, transfected with plasmid containing ARE-luciferin gene, RA predominantly enhances activity and promotes nuclear factor E2-related factor-2 (Nrf2) translocation from cytoplasm to the nucleus and also increases MRP2 and P-gp e ux activity along with intercellular ATP level [ 19]. A study conducted by Wu et al. [ 20] reported that RA inhibited CCRF-CEM and CEM /ADR5000 cells in a dose-dependent pattern but caused less cytotoxicity towards normal lymphocytes. RA concurrently induced necrosis and apoptosis and stimulated MMP dysfunction activated PARP-cleavage and caspase-independent apoptosis. RA also blocked the translocation of p65 from the cytosol to the nucleus [ 20]. Moreover, it inhibits transcription factor hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) expression, which a ects the glycolytic pathway; meanwhile, it also suppressed glucose consumption and lactate production in colorectal cells [ 21]. RA also inhibits micro RNAs and pro-inflammatory cytokines and thus may suppress the Warburg e ects through an inflammatory pathway involving activator of transcription-3 (STAT3) and signal transducer of interleukin 22]. Furthermore, RA inhibits HL-60 promyelocytic leukemia cells' growth and development and provides strong scavenging free radical e ects, disturbing the balance of nuclear deoxyribonucleotide triphosphate (dNTP) levels without a ecting protein levels of (R1, R2, p53R2) subunits, ultimately leading to apoptosis induction [ 23,24]. RA application, at a concentration of 5 mg /kg b.w. during 30 weeks in 1,2-dimethyldrazin stimulated colon carcinogenesis in the rat at 20 mg /kg b.w. and signicantly stopped tumor formation and proliferation. RA supplementation also reduced tumor necrosis factor- (TNF-), cyclooxygenase-2 levels, and modulated p65 expression [ 25]. It is also able to inhibit the release of the highly mobile group box 1 (HMGB1) and to slow down HMGB1-dependent inflammatory responses in human endothelial cells, stopping HMBG1-mediated hyperpermeability and leukocytes migration in decreases aberrant crypt foci (ACF) multiplicity in rats [ 27]. RA inhibited APC10.1 cell growth that comes in Apc (Min) mouse model of colorectal carcinogenesis [ 28]. Through oral administration, RA totally prevented skin tumor cells formation in DMBA-induced mouse skin carcinogenesis and decreased lipid peroxidation byproducts levels [ 29]. It also inhibited human ovarian cancer A2780 cell line, disturbing the cell cycle at multiple phases and stimulating apoptosis by modifying multiple genes expression, involved in apoptosis regulation [ 30]. RA induced the cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in prostate cancer cell lines (PCa, PC-3, and DU145) [ 31]. These eects (HDACs), specically HDAC2; the aberrant expression of theses enzymes is related with the onset of human cancer. 176Appl. Sci. 2019 ,9, 3139 In rats with 1,2 dimethylhydrazine-induced colon carcinogenesis, RA administration at dose of 2.5, 5, and 10 mg/kg b.w. led to a decrease in the number of polyps (50%), reversed oxidative markers (21%), [ 32]. RA can also inhibit adhesion, invasion, and migration of Ls 174-T human colon carcinoma cells through enhancing GSH levels and decreasing ROS levels. Finally, RA may also inhibit colorectal carcinoma metastasis, by reducing the extracellular signal-regulated kinase pathway and the number and weight of lung tumors [ 33]. MDA-MB-231BO human bone homing breast cancer cells migrations are also inhibited by RA, whereas the number and size of mineralized nodules in ST-2 murine bone marrow stoma cells cultures raise [ 34]. RA also enhances chemosensitivity of human resistant gastric carcinoma SGC7901 cells [ 35]. The anticancer potential of RA analogues has also been tested. RA analogue-11 induces apoptosis of SGC7901 via the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) /Akt/nuclear factor kappa B (NF- B) pathway [ 36]. Figure 3. Mechanism of rosmarinic acid as an anticancer agent. 3.2. Antidiabetic Activity RA supplementation increases the expression biogenesis key genes, activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) in the skeletal muscle of insulin-resistant rats as well as in L6 myotubes. It also increased glucose faster and decreased serine IRS-1 phosphorylation, while increasing the glucose transporter type 4 (GLUT4) transfer [ 37]. In streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic rats, RA exerted a noticeable hypoglycemic e ect, whereas in high-fat diet (HFD) fed diabetic rats it increased glucose utilization and ameliorated insulin sensitivity. RA supplementation inverted the STZ- and HFD-induced increase in phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) expression in the liver and the STZ- and HFD-induced decrease in GLUT4expression in skeletal muscle. RA exerts hypoglycemic e ects and improves insulin sensitivity, also increasing GLUT4 expression and decreasing PEPCK expression [ 38]. In addition, it also reverses memory and learning defects through improving cognition in healthy rats, inhibiting hyperglycemia, lipid peroxidation, and enhancing antioxidant defense system [ 39]. At a concentration of 10 mg /kg, RA decreased TBARS levels in kidney and liver of STZ-induced diabetic rats. This e ect was mainly conferred by its ability to increase superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) activity and to reverse the decrease in ascorbic acid and of non-protein thiol levels in diabetic rats [ 40]. RA administration also ameliorated oxidative stress markers in diabetic rats and water consumption and urination. Thus, it was proposed that RA mitigates STZ-induced diabetic manifestations by protecting rat's tissues against 177Appl. Sci. 2019 ,9, 3139 free radicals' damaging e ects [ 15]. At 100 mg/kg, RA signicantly increased insulin index sensitivity and reduced reduced fatty acids (FFA), triglycerides, serum cholesterol, AOPPs, lipid peroxides, and protein carbonyls levels in plasma and pancreas of diabetic rats. The reduced activities of CAT, SOD, glutathione S-transferases (GST), and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and the reduced levels of vitamins C and E, ceruloplasmin, and GSH in plasma of diabetic rats were also signicantly recovered by RA application. Furthermore, it protects pancreatic -cells from oxidative stress in HFD-STZ-induced experimental diabetes [ 41]. The protective eects of RA (30 mg /kg) against hypoglycemia, hyperlipidemia, oxidative stress, and an imbalanced gut microbiota architecture was studied in diabetic rats. The treatment decreased the levelsof fasting plasma glucose, total cholesterol, and triglyceride, exhibited an antioxidant and antiglycative eect, showed protective e ects against tissue damage and inflammation in the abdominal aorta, increased the population of diabetes-resistant bacteria, and decreased the number of diabetes-sensitive bacteria [ 12]. RA also reduced diabetes occurrence and preserved normal insulin secretion, ROS, and reactive nitrogen species (RNS) by regulating antioxidant enzymes, and attenuating the pro-inflammatory T helper 2 and T regulatory cells levels [ 42]. At a concentration of 10 mg /kg, RA treatment signicantly reduced lipid peroxidation (28%), 43]. In Wistar rats, RA administrated orally at 50 mg /kg for 10 weeks in STZ-induced diabetes diminished endothelium-dependent relaxation by aortic endothelial function protection against diabetes-induced damage [ 44]. Finally, it signicantly inhibited the carbohydrate-induced adaptive increase of sodium-dependent glucose cotransporter 1 (SGLT1) in the enterocyte brush border membrane [ 45]. 3.3. Antimicrobial Activity Regarding RA antimicrobial activity, it exerted antibacterial e ects against Staphylococcus aureus strains, and the lowest blocking concentration was found to be 0.8 and 10 mg /mL against S. aureus and methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), respectively. Moreover, it displayed synergistic e ects with amoxicillin, ofloxacin and vancomycin antibiotics against S. aureus , and only with vancomycin against MRSA. Time-kill analysis showed that using a combination of RA with antibiotics is more eective than using individual antibiotics. Microbial surface components recognizing adhesive matrix molecules (MSCRAMM) adhesion protein expression in MRSA and S. aureus was also signicantly suppressed by using a combination of RA with vancomycin rather than RA alone [ 46]. On the other hand, RA administration reduced biolm formation in a concentration- and time-dependent manner, suggesting that it could be used as an e ective antimicrobial agent to kill the planktonic cells activity and to reduces the biolm formation activity in early-stage development [ 47]. RA also exerts inhibitory Escherichia coli K-12 and Staphylococcus carnosus LTH1502 growth, through decreasing cell counts and cell number [ 48]. Under acidic conditions, RA was reacted with nitrite ions to give 6,6-nitro and 6-dinitrorosmarinic acids. These compounds were active as HIV-1 integrase inhibitors at sub-molecular levels and inhibited viral replication in MT-4 cells. Without increasing cellular toxicity levels, RA nitration A strongly improved anti-integrase inhibition and antiviral eects [ 49]. Moreover, Enterobacteriaceae spp., Pseudomonas spp., lactic acid bacteria, yeast and mold, psychotropic counts, as well as fate Listeria monocytogenes inculcated in chicken meats [ 50]. Finally, RA also displayed inhibitory e ects against S. aureus cocktail through inducing morphological changes and reducing viable cells counts and causing morphological changes in cheese and meat samples, such as cell shrinkage and appearance of blabbing-like structures in cell surfaces [ 51-53]. 178Appl. Sci. 2019 ,9, 3139 3.4. Cardioprotective Activity RA at 25, 50, 10 mg /L had the capacity to maintain ATP levels in cells and inhibit the decrease in H/R-induced cell viability, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) leakage, and excessive endothelial protein C receptor (EPCR) has a prominent role in inflammation and coagulation, whereas its activity is signicantly changed by ectodomain cleavage and release as the soluble protein (sEPCR). RA has been found to be a strong anti-inflammatory agent. Monitoring (CLP)-mediated EPCR shedding and underlying mechanisms, it was found that RA treatment led to a potent inhibition of PMA, TNF- , and IL-induced EPCR shedding expression reduced phosphorylation. These support the upcoming use of RA as an anti-sEPCR shedding reagent against administration in fructose-fed rats (FFR) signicantly enhanced insulin sensitivity, reduced lipid levels, oxidative damage, and a p22phox subunit of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate reduced oxidase expression as well as prevented cardiac hypertrophy. RA lowered fructose-induced blood pressure through decreasing angiotensin-converting enzymes activity andendothelin-1 and increasing the level of nitric oxide (NO) [ 57]. RA also reduced fasting serum levels of vascular cell SOD levels [ 58]. RA also intervenes in many important steps of angiogenesis, including adhesion, migration, proliferation, and tube formation of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) in a dose-dependent pattern. It also decreased IL-8 release from endothelial cells, H 2O2-dependent vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression, and intracellular ROS levels [ 59]. Finally, in H9c2 cardiac muscle cells, RA inhibited apoptosis by decreasing intracellular ROS generation and recovering mitochondria membrane potential [ 60,61]. 3.5. Antioxidant Activity RA exhibited free radicals scavenging activity in hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) as a result of its antioxidant eects by boosting GSH synthesis and participating in NF- B-dependent inhibition of MMP-2 activity. It also has the ability to reverse activated HSCs to quiescent cells and ultimately inhibits MMP-2 activity. RNA interference-imposed knockdown of NF- B abolished MMP-2 down-regulation by RA. NF- B inactivation mediated by RA could be blocked by the diphenyleneiodonium chloride, a potent had e ect. At once, RA suppresses lipid peroxidation (LPO) and ROS generation, whereas in HSC-T6 cells it increases cellular GSH. Additionally, it cysteine and antioxidant response element (ARE)-mediated luciferase by RA is inhibited by shRNA-induced Nrf2 knockdown. The knocking down of Nrf2 abolished RA-mediated inhibition of ROS [ 16,62]. On the other hand, lycopene and RA administration reduced elevated blood urea nitrogen, /B) levels induced by gentamicin. This combination also increased the reduced SOD, an antiapoptotic ameliorated gentamicin-induced histopathological changes. Moreover, it also evidenced a greater protective e ect than corresponding monotherapy [ 63]. Thein vivo antioxidant defense system consists enzymes including CAT, GPx, SOD, and nutritional antioxidants. Any disturbance in normal antioxidant defense system triggers several diseases, including diabetes, cancer, atherosclerosis, and degenerative diseases [ 64]. In experimental animals, carbon tetrachloride (CCl 4) induced neurotoxicity, whereas CCl 4skin absorption, inhalation, 179Appl. Sci. 2019 ,9, 3139 and ingestion increased lipid peroxidation and reduced protein and antioxidant enzymes contents. This molecule produces free radicals in the lungs, heart, blood cells, and kidney. Under aerobic conditions, CCl 4is converted into highly reactive trichloromethyl radicals through the action of the cytochrome P450 system [ 65]. Brain amyloid- (A) accumulation is a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and has an important role in cognitive dysfunction [ 66]. At a dose of 0.25 mg /kg, RA signicantly enhanced cognitive function and object discrimination and recognition test. Furthermore, RA decreased the time to reach the platform and increased the number of crossings over the removed platform, when compared with A25-35-induced group in Morris water maze test; moreover, it reduced NO and MDA levels in kidney, brain, and liver [ 67]. RA also suppresses AD development by reducing amyloid aggregation by increasing monoamine secretion in mice [ 68]. RA also prevented oxidative stress in C6 glial cells by increasing cell viability and inhibiting lipid peroxidation. It also decreased H 2O2-induced COX-2 and iNOS expression at the transcriptional level COX-2 protein expression and iNOS in C6 glial cells treated with RA [ 67]. It signicantly reduced oxidative stress and increased antioxidant status in Wistar rats post-spinal cord injury (SCI). RA also facilitated the inflammatory process through pro-inflammatory post-SCI and down-regulated NF- B[69]. It also exerted a signicant cytoprotective e ect through covering the intercellular ROS in keratinocytes. RA also increased CAT, SOD, heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), and transcription factor Nrf2 expression and activity, markedly reduced by UVB radiation [ 70]. On the other hand, in G93A-SOD1 transgenic mice with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), RA application at a daily dose of 400 mg /kg signicantly increased their survival by reliving function motor neurons decits. These types of systematic changes were closely correlated with a decrease in neuronal loss and oxidative stress in ventral horns of G93A-SOD1 mice [ 71]. RA also increased SOD, GSH and GPx activities and decreased MDA levels in kidney and liver of sepsis-induced rats [ 72]. RA also reduced threshold shift, attenuated noise-induced hearing loss, and promoted hair cells survival. Moreover, it enhanced the endogenous antioxidant defense system by decreasing SOD production and up-regulation and decreased 4-HNE expression [ 73,74]. SOD, CAT, and GPx activities were increased through RA application at a dose of 50, 100, and 200 mg /kg. Furthermore, it induced structural changes in the kidney and liver at a dose of 200 mg /kg [75,76]. 3.6. Hepatoprotective Activity Sepsis, shock, and renal artery stenosis are the major clinical problems of acute renal failure, usually associated with high morbimortality rates. Ischemia-reperfusion (I-R) injury provokes cell damage, cell death, tissue necrosis, multiorgan dysfunction and increases vascular permeability. These types of physiopathological processes include RNS, platelets, coagulation and xanthine oxidoreductase enzyme system activation. During I-R injury, cell death occurs as a result of both apoptosis and necrosis [ 77-79]. RA modulates lipid peroxidation, production of ROS, peroxynitrite formation, complement factors and proinflammatory mediators, such as cytokines and chemokines. These processes are involved in hepatic diseases [ 80]. On the other hand, RA at dose of 150 mg /kg was able to treat rats with I-R, lowered lipid peroxidation and nitro tyrosine levels, enhanced GSH and inltration, hepatocellular damage, and all oxidative or nitrative stress markers. It also exerted anti-inflammatory and antioxidant e ects in the ischemic liver, protecting hepatocytes from ischemic injury [ 81,82]. Moreover, it also conferred marked protection against oxidative stress through increasing CAT and GPx contents, thus preventing hepatic steatosis. Di erent RA derivatives have also been reported as having anti-secretory and antiulcer e ects in epithelial tissues, being able to heal gastric ulceration [ 83]. Indeed, RA led to a signicant reduction in hepatic toxicity, including alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and improved antioxidant eects of GPx, CAT, and SOD enzymes [ 26]. A marked improvement in liver serum markers and histology and inflammatory process decrease were also stated after RA administration at 180Appl. Sci. 2019 ,9, 3139 a dose of 10, 25, and 50 mg /kg by gavage once daily for two consecutive days against CCl 4-induced hepatic necrosis. Furthermore, RA prevented -smooth muscle actin ( -SMA) and transforming growth factor 1 expression, probrotic response suppression [ 84]. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) is required for HSCs di erentiation, and its epigenetic repression carries on the HSCs activation. RA inhibits HSCs signaling and expression by canonical Wnts as well as suppresses liver brosis progression and activation [ 85-87]. In CCl 4-induced rat liver brosis model, RA inhibited HSCs proliferation and TGF- l, connective transforming growth factor (CTGF), and -SMA expression. Much evidence has shown that RA can decrease brosis grade and ameliorate biochemical and histopathological and high mobility group box1 protein levels. RA also inhibited I kappa B kinase pathway and modulated NF- B. RA intravenous injection also decreased puncture-induced Additionally, RA down-regulated IL-6 and TNF- levels, triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells, high mobility group box1 protein, and endotoxin whilst up-regulating the serum IL-6 level. Moreover, post-RA injection, a marked decrease in serum enzyme activities was observed, along with amelioration of liver, lungs, and small intestine hemodynamics; this anti-inflammatory mechanism may be explained through inhibition of NF- B pathway activation by inhibiting I kappa B kinase activity [ 89]. RA also decreased ROS production and protein and DNA synthesis inhibition in a dose-dependent manner [ 90]. In extrahepatic cholestasis rat model by bile-duct ligation, RA showed hepatoprotective e ect via mechanisms involving resolution of oxidative burden and down-regulation of HMGB1 [ 91]. 3.7. Antidepressant Potential RA eects at a dose of 0, 3, 10, or 30 mg /kg were investigated in female C57BL /6 mice for 60 min before pilocarpine (300 mg /kg) or pentylenetetrazol (PTZ, 60 mg /kg) injection. Generalized seizure duration and myoclonic generalized tonic-clonic seizure latencies were analyzed by electroencephalographic (EEG) and behavioral methods. The e ect of an acute RA dose on mice was also evaluated in behavior in the open eld, rotarod, novel object recognition, and forced swim tests. In the PTZ model, RA dose-dependently increased generalized seizures and latency to myoclonic jerks and improved pilocarpine-induced myoclonic jerks' latency. Additionally, RA (30 mg /kg) improved the time at the center of the open eld, the crossings number and the immobility time in forced swim test [ 92]. Worldwide mood disorders are the most spreading forms of mental illness and, in main cases, morbidity. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), depression is one of the top causes of morbimortality throughout the world. Depression is a recurrent, potentially life-threatening, and chronic mood disorder that has been estimated to a ect about 21% of the world population [ 93]. RA administration (10 mg /kg, daily) in chronic stress Sprague Dawley rats changed depressive behaviors in rats exposed to impulsive stress modal and restored hippocampal brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and pERK1 /2 protein expression. Thus, RA could be conceived as a great molecule in the treatment of depression and in triggering changes in BDNF levels and in ERK11 /2 signaling in pharmacological science [ 94]. In PC 12 cells, RA showed signicant neurotrophic e ects and improved cholinergic functions in correlation with the ERK1 /2 signaling pathway and MAPK. RA also caused an extensive up-regulation of pyruvate carboxylase (PC) and and dopaminergic pathways regulation, whereas against corticosterone-induced toxicity it provides neuronal cells protection [ 95]. 3.8. Nephroprotective Activity Currently, the most often used antimicrobial agents provoke an acute renal injury in 60% of acquired infections in hospitals with noticeable morbimortality rates [ 96]. Among them, aminoglycosides 181Appl. Sci. 2019 ,9, 3139 have been frequently used to treat bacterial infections, and gentamicin is the most commonly used aminoglycoside, given its lower costs and lower rate of antibiotic-acquired resistance; nevertheless, its therapeutic use at 80 mg /kg/day for more than 7 days induces nephrotoxicity in about 30% of patients [ 97]. Acute renal toxicity characterization is assessed by the sudden decrease of kidney function due to the accumulation of urea, creatinine, and other waste products. Gentamicin-induced nephrotoxicity is related to enhanced oxidative stress levels, which may be a major contributing factor for renal injury [ 98]. RA led to a decrease in serum blood urea nitrogen and creatinine levels in Sprague Dawley rats and ultimately decreased myeloperoxidase and MDA levels. In fact, the level of incident injury decreased in the RA-treated group. In addition, RA extensively reduced Bowman's capsules dilatation, glomerular necrosis, tubular epithelium degeneration, tubular epithelium necrosis and dilatation, and focal glomerular necrosis [ 99]. RA at doses of 1, 2, and 5 mg /kg for 2 days signicantly increased serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen levels and reduced cisplatin (CP)-induced histopathological changes. RA TNF- and NF-B expression, as stated through inflammation inhibition. Moreover, RA reduced p53, phosphorylated p53, and active caspase-3-expression in kidney through exerting antiapoptotic activity [ 100]. RA also notably reduced MDA, tubular necrosis, urea, and creatinine levels, and increased renal GSH, SOD, CAT, GPS, volume density creatinine clearance, and PCT [ 101]. Finally, RA could provide protective e ects against 6-hydroxydopamine-induced neurotoxicity via its antioxidant activity [ 102]. 3.9. Anti-Aging Activity RA administration could e ectively reverse chaperones- and Pin1-induced abnormal changes and suppress P-tau and insoluble P-tau formation, induced by chronic restraint stress (CRS), particularly in middle-aged mice [ 103]. AD is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that causes dementia in older people. Disease indicators include the appearance of plaques and tangles in brain tissues, which progressively kill neurons from brain cortex, amygdala, hippocampus, and other non-regeneratable brain regions. Consequently, acetylcholine (ACh) levels decline, the widely known cholinergic decit hypothesisfor AD. ACh has a signicant role in brain functions, such as thinking, reasoning, remembering, and behavioral abilities [ 104,105]. In AD, stress is an important risk factor, since it induces tau phosphorylation and enhances tau insolubility in the brain. RA application is able to dominantly suppress the increase in tau phosphorylation levels and insoluble P-tau formation, facilitated by chronic resistant stress, and overturn the abnormal changes in middle-aged mice [ 103]. At 1.6, 16 and 32 mg /kg, RA exerted markedly useful e ects on memory and learning and also reduced the levels of protein carbonyls in the hippocampus [ 106]. In ALS, a neurodegenerative disease, RA signicantly delays motor neuron dysfunction in paw grip endurance tests, through attenuating motor neurons degeneration and extending the life span of ALS mice model, detected at later stages, and about 2% patients present an associated mutation in the gene encoding Cu /Zn-SOD [ 107]. RA also exerted protective e ects neurotoxicity and prevented 1-methyl-4-phenypyridinium dopaminergic cells. In fact, 1-methyl-4- phenylpyridinium treatment reduces cell viability and dopamine contents, as well as causes apoptotic morphological changes. Additionally, 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium precedes mitochondrial dysfunction, easily detected through inhibiting mitochondrial respiratory chain complex 1-associated activity, suggesting mitochondrial transmembrane collapse and ROS generation. Thus, RA pretreatment was able to restore mitochondrial respiratory chain complex 1 activity and to reverse the other MPP positive damaging e ects [ 91,92] partially. In mice, RA improves oxidative stress parameters and mitochondrial respiratory chain activity [ 108]. RA also proved to be e ective in preventing in vitro 182Appl. Sci. 2019 ,9, 3139 amyloid peptide aggregation and in delaying disease progression in animal models [ 109]. It also provided neuroprotective e ects against A -induced toxicity by lowering lipid peroxidation, DNA and ROS formation, and inhibiting phosphorylated p38 MAPK levels [ 110,111]. RA improved antioxidant properties a ected by RA; in fact, it is able to attenuate LDH, intercellular ROS, and mitochondrial membrane potential disruption. RA also promoted TH and BDNF genes up-regulation and prevented genotoxicity [ 113,114]. Clovamide in combination with RA, at the rate of 10-100 M, in SH-SY5Y cells signicantly enhanced PPAR expression and inhibited NF-B translocation, [ 115]. 3.10. Anti-Allergic Activity RA 2 and thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) expression in induced mast cells proliferation. It also signicantly decreased the levels of phosphorylated signal transducer, IL-13, and transcription-6 activation in TSLP-stimulated HMC-1 cells. Moreover, RA triggered an increment of p53 levels, poly-ADP-ribose polymerase cleavage, caspase-3 activation, and a reduction in Bcl2 procaspase-3 Furthermore, it signicantly and IL-1 production in TSLP-stimulated HMC-1 cells. It also reduced IL-4, immunoglobulin E (IgE), and TSLP levels in short ragweed pollen-induced allergic conjunctivitis mouse model [ 116]. In murine model of respiratory allergy caused by Bloma tropicalis (Bt) mite, RA led to a considerable decrease in leukocytes or eosinophils numbers in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), of mucus presence in the respiratory tract, reduced lung histopathological changes, and eosinophil peroxidase activity and IL-4 changes [ 117,118]. At a dose of 1 or 5 Mi nN C/Nga mice under specic pathogenic free conditions, RA was shown to be the most e ective treatment against 2,4-dinitrofluorobenzene (DNFB)-induced AD-like skin lesion. Moreover, it suppressed IL-4 and interferon (INF) production by activated CD4+ cells. RA also inhibited skin lesions and ears thickness development and increased total serum IgE levels in DNFB-treated NC /Nga mice [ 119]. Furthermore, it inhibited IgE levels increase in spleen, nasal mucosa, and serum, inhibited the increase in rubs number, and reduced histamine levels in ovalbumin unsensitized (OVA) mice. RA also inhibited protein levels and mRNA expressions of IL-6, IL-1 , and TNF- in or in OVA-sensitized mice [ 120,121]. In a murine model of allergic asthma triggered by house dust mites (HDMs), RA inhibited the boost up of mononuclear, eosinophils, and neutrophils cells levels around airways and in BAL fluid. Moreover, it also signicantly inhibited IL-13 expression increased by HDM allergen [ 122]. RA (200 mg or 50 mg for 21 days) also reduced the number of eosinophils and neutrophils as /primedeoxyguanosine (8OH-dG) and thiobarbituric acid reactive substance (TBARS) and TPA levels were markedly reduced by RA pretreatment. Furthermore, RA is conceived as a potential agent against seasonal allergic rhino conjunctivitis RA also inhibited signicantly the increases in eosinophils levels in BAL fluid along with murine airways. In the lungs of sensitized mice, RA inhibited the increase in protein expression of IL-5, IL-4, and eotaxin. Thus, RA seems to be a successful intervention for allergic asthma, given its ability to increase chemokines, cytokines, and allergen-specic antibody levels [ 124]. Additionally, RA reduced inflammation and allergic immunoglobulin responses occurring in mice PMNL. It also noticeably increased the response rates for itchy eyes, watery eyes, and itchy nose and reduced eosinophils and neutrophils levels in nasal lavage fluid of 125]. 183Appl. Sci. 2019 ,9, 3139 3.11. Anti-Inflammatory Activity RA administration (40 mg /kg) in a rat model of sciatic nerve chronic constriction injury (CCI)-induced neuropathic pain reduced spinal inflammatory markers, such matrix 2 (MMP2), prostaglandin E2 (PGE-2), IL-1 , and COX-2 [ 126]. In addition, RA administration (75, 150, and 300 mg/kg) in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) for 10 days reduced inflammatory TNF- , IL-6, and p65 expression in the xenograft microenvironment [ 127]. On the other hand, RA (IC 50=14.25M) inhibited LPS-induced NO production in RAW 264.7 cells. It and independent pathways, down-regulation of iNOS by RA was due to myeloid di erentiation primary response gene 88 (MyD88). Additionally, RA triggered HO-1 expression through inducing Nrf2 activity [ 92,128]. RA (5, 10, and 20 mg /kg) also inhibited Th2 cytokines in BAL fluid, increased inflammatory cells, ameliorated hyper airway responsiveness (AHR), and reduced total IgE and Ova-specic IgE concentrations in a murine model of asthma (female BALB /c mice). In upper airways, RA reduced the number of mucus hypersecretion and inflammatory cells. It seems that RA protective e ects might be mediated by p38 phosphorylation, JNK, and ERK suppression. Additionally, RA pretreatment provoked Ym2, expression in lung tissues [ 129]. In SPI, RA noticeably increased antioxidant status and reduced oxidative stress levels in Wistar rats post-SCI. It also improved inflammatory mechanisms through pro-inflammatory cytokines reduction and NF- B down regulation [ 69]. RA (10, 25, and 50 mg /kg) also remarkably decreased the serum transaminases (ALT and AST) and LDH concentration in liver ischemia-reperfusion rats. Furthermore, it reduced multiorgan dysfunction markers (lung, liver, and kidney) through metalloproteinase-9 and NF- B modulating [ 130]. RA also displayed both peripheral and central antinociceptive e ects and anti-inflammatory activity against chronic and acute inflammation [ 83,131-133]. In Freund's complete adjuvant (FCA)-induced arthritic rats, RA attenuates inflammation [ 134]. RA also decreased blocked TNF- group box1 SH-SY5Y cells. It also decreased brain edema, reduced NF- B activation and HMGB1 expression, and attenuated histopathological damage at a dose of 50 mg /kg [135]. RA also considerably lowered allergic asthma through a signicant decrease in the number of leukocytes /eosinophils, of mucus present in the respiratory tract, eosinophil peroxidase activity, and IL-4 and histopathological changes in lung BAL fluid [ 117,136]. RA-derived water and ethanol extract also markedly inhibited LPS-stimulated PGE-2 and NO production in a dose-dependent manner in RAW 264.7 mouse macrophages [ 137]. 4. Conclusions Current evidence supports the deepened exploration of RA as a promising therapeutic agent against a wide variety of modern lifestyle disorders (Table 1). However, mechanisms underlying RA's therapeutic activity need further investigation. Initial studies indicate that RA may act through various mechanisms, such as exerting anti-inflammatory and antioxidant e ects as well as inhibiting cell proliferation, migration, and selectively inducing cancer cells apoptosis. In addition, RA's anti-angiogenic e ects, as demonstrated through human umbilical vein endothelial cells proliferation, migration, adhesion, and tube formation inhibition, suggest that it can be benecial in preventing tumor growth and metastasis. Thus, given the above-highlighted aspects, rosemary extract can be conceived as a rich source of potential candidates to be included in the diet with promising eects at pre-determined doses, avoiding toxicity. 184Appl.
