Notes 10 ab232855 Crystal violet Assay Kit (Cell viability) 11.Overview Crystal violet Assay Kit (Cell viability) (ab232855) offers an excellent and efficient method for in vitro cytotoxicity studies as well as high- throughput drug screening. It is simple, accurate, reproducible and sensitive. It includes Doxorubicin as a positive control. The Crystal violet staining is directly proportional to the cell biomass and can be measured at 570 nm. This type of staining is a quick and versatile assay for screening cell viability under diverse stimulation or inhibition conditions.

For general guidelines, precautions, limitations on the use of our assay kits and general assay troubleshooting tips, particularly for first time users, please consult our guide: www.abcam.com/assaykitguidelines For typical data produced using the assay, please see the assay kit datasheet on our website.ab232855 Crystal violet Assay Kit (Cell viability) 55.Reagent Preparation Briefly centrifuge small vials at low speed prior to opening. 5.1 Crystal violet Staining Solution 1.Bring to room temperature. 2.Add 11 ml of 100% methanol (not supplied) into the bottle. 3.Shake contents and let it stand for 15 minutes at room temperature. 4.After use store at -20\u00b0C. 5.2 10X Washing Solution 1.Add 1 part of 10X Washing Solution to 9 parts deionized water to make 1X Washing Solution. 2.After use store at 4\u00b0C. 5.3 Solubilization Solution 1.Bring to room temperature. 2.After use store at RT. 5.4 20 mM Doxorubicin 1.Thaw Doxorubicin before use. 2.After use store at -20\u00b0C.ab232855 Crystal violet Assay Kit (Cell viability) 66.Assay Procedure Equilibrate all materials and prepared reagents to room temperature just prior to use and gently agitate. Assay all standards, controls and samples in duplicate. 6.1 Cell Culture: 1.Grow adherent cells to ~80% confluency. 2.Trypsinize and spin down the cells. 3.Add 5 mL of growth medium to disperse the cells. 4.Determine the cell density by using a hemocytometer. 5.Adjust the cell concentration if necessary. 6.Add 200 \u00b5L of the cell suspension (25,000-100000 cell/mL) to 96-well clear flat-bottom plate to seed 5000-20000 cells/well. 7.Let the cells settle down overnight and adhere to the plate. 6.2 Compound Treatment: 1.Prepare compounds using DMSO as solvent. 2.Dilute compound stock solution in DMSO appropriately. Note Recommended final DMSO concentration in wells should be 0.5% or less. 3.Add compounds to the wells. 4.Prepare a DMSO vehicle control and a background control (cell culture growth media). 5.For inhibitor control: add 1 \u00b5L of 20 mM Doxorubicin to a well containing the cells 6.Incubate the plate at 37\u00b0C in a humidified incubator with 5% CO 2 for 72 hours. 6.3 Crystal violet Staining: 1.Remove the culture medium. 2.Wash cells with 200 \u00b5L of 1X Washing Solution. Note Washing should be done as gentle as possible to avoid disturbance of the cell monolayer. 3.Remove wash solutions as much as possible by pipetting. 4.Add 50 \u00b5L of Crystal Violet Staining Solution (with methanol) to each well and stain for 20 minutes at RT. 5.After incubation, remove the staining solution. 6.Use 200 \u00b5L of 1X Washing Solution to wash the cells. 7.Wash the cells four times.ab232855 Crystal violet Assay Kit (Cell viability) 78.At the end of the washing step, remove washing solutions as much as possible by pipetting and air-dry the plate if necessary. 6.4 Solubilization: 1.Add 100 \u00b5L of Solubilization Solution to each well. 2.Shake the plate occasionally or place the plate on a shaker for 20 minutes at room temperature. 6.5 Measurement: 1.Measure the O.D. at 570 nm. 6.6 Calculations: 1.Correct the background by subtracting the O.D. of the background control from all readings. 2.Calculate the percentage of cytotoxicity using the formula below: % = 100% Where: OD DMSO is the OD of the DMSO control after background correction. OD sample is the OD of the sample after background correction.ab232855 Crystal violet Assay Kit (Cell viability) 87.FAQs / Troubleshooting General troubleshooting points can be found at www.abcam.com/assaykitguidelines.ab232855 Crystal violet Assay Kit (Cell viability) 98.Typical Data Data provided for demonstration purposes only .
