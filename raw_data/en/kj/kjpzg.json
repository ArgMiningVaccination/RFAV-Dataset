W e are also on top of the social game, with huge Facebook and Twitter communities. On almost any social network\u2014Instagram, Pinterest, LinkedIn\u2014we're there. One thing we've noticed, though, is that doctors of chiropractic aren't as social as most othergroups. W e see that you go online, you read, andyou share information with one another, butwhen it comes to interacting as a group, you're abit reserved. Perhaps this is because you've chosen a profession that is somewhat iconoclastic bydefinition, and it' s natural to bring thatperspective to other areas of life. Y et medicine(and the delivery of healthcare in general) is moving in the direction of collaborative care. T o be trulyeffective in the environment now taking shape around us,you'll need to be efficient in interacting with other membersof your patients' healthcare teams. In fact, this word \"team\" is revamping the shape of how services in the medical space are being delivered today. Theold model of a senior doctor dictating commands to juniorstaff is rapidly disappearing. Instead, as with a sports team,each member has a defined role and responsibilities. Ideally, tests and patient histories shouldn't be duplicated. The work one doctor performs can be a stepping stone foranother. In this issue of Chiropractic Economics, we have multiple articles that discuss these topics, and we take a closer look atthe ins and outs of bringing a PT on board your practice.Y ou'll see that when this works best, it is when the DC andPT join forces in a non-competitive relationship.

Eczema is an immunological condition affecting both children and adults, where patches of skin become inflamed, red and itchy. Craig Osleeb, MD, explained that \"children with eczema have an overabundance of the bacteria normally found on skin.\" He is a pediatric allergist at Northern Westchester Hospital in Mount Kisco, N.Y. \"The excessive colonization of bacteria can exacerbate symptoms by causing infection and/ortriggering inflammation,\" Osleeb said. So, \"antibiotics have often been used to quell eczema exacerbations.\" But Osleeb noted that the overuse of antibiotics can lead to dangerous drug-resistant \"superbug\" infections, and prior studies have never settled the issue of whether antibiotics help ease eczema flare-ups. t o read more, visit ChiroEco.com/antibioticseczema Source:HealthDayNews,healthday.com ADOBE STOCKCHIROECO.COM A p r i l 1 8 , 2 0 1 7 CHIROPRACTIC ECONOMICS 15CLINICALCONCERNS Backtolife Understand the benefits and science behind mTBI treatments. BY DANIEL J. BOURASSA, DC THE USE OF TRANSCRANIAL LOW LEVEL LASER THERAPY (TLLLT)IS finding increasing acceptance in the treatment and management of neurodegenerative diseases and mildtraumatic brain injury (mTBI.) Thefact that tLLLT can be effectivelyemployed using the near-infrared lowlevel lasers already found in manychiropractic offices allows doctors ofchiropractic to be instrumental in theearly management of mTBI patients.Essential to good therapeutic outcomesis a basic understanding ofbiostimulation, clinical benefits, andindividual laser equipment used in thetreatment of mTBI. Mitochondrialbiostimulation Before addressing the clinical benefitsof tLLLT , it will be helpful to understandhow the therapeutic use of near-infrared laser light affects the cell. Thefollowing is a brief review of the mito-chondrial biology affected by themechanics of photobiostimulation.Cytochrome c oxidase (COX) isComplex IV and the terminal enzymeof the electron transport chain. It playsa vital role in the bioenergetics of a cell. COX is a multicomponent membrane protein that contains a binuclear coppercenter along with a heme binuclearcenter, both of which facilitate thetransfer of electrons from COX tooxygen. Generally speaking, COX canbe in three states: fully oxidized, fullyreduced, or as a partially reducedenzyme, usually called mixed-valenceone. The mixed valence has some metalcenters in their higher oxidation state,and the remainder in their loweroxidation state. COX cannot beconsidered as a primary photoreceptorwhen it is fully oxidized or fully reduced,but only when it is in one of the mixedvalence states. In the simplest terms, light is deliv-ered in energy packets called photons.Photon energy is the energy carried bya single photon with a certain electro-magnetic wavelength and frequency.Photons are absorbed by delocalizedelectron pi clouds of complex aromaticmolecules (i.e., heme) with matchingwavelengths, exciting them to a higherenergy state. This energy is passed tothe metalloprotein centers. When theenergy excitement is high enough, themetal center releases an electronreducing the metal center. This is theinitialization of photobiostimulation. The near-infrared (NIR) spectrum of 600 to 1,000 nm is the photobios-timulation light spectrum. The mid600 nm and low 800 nm spectra havebeen shown to have the mostbeneficial effects in recent researchalthough some higher wavelengthshave been reported to offer benefit. It is known that LLLT reverses both states of COX-related mitochondrialADOBE STOCK16 CHIROPRACTIC ECONOMICS A p r i l 1 8 , 2 0 1 7 CHIROECO.COMCLINICAL CONCERNS dysfunction: excessive reduction and excessive oxidation COX. Whenexposed to LLLT , COX becomes a newsource of highly energized electrons.These newly released electrons can beaccepted by NAD and FAD atComplexes I and II to re-energize theelectron transport chain (ETC) in thehypoxic state of the injured cell' smitochondria. A \"closed loop\" forms as electronsare recirculated instead of attaching toO 2and disappearing. At the same time, Complexes I and III maintain theproton pump and thereby restore theproduction of needed ATP in stressedand injured cells. It does this withoutthe damaging effects of excess super-oxide anion production that wouldnormally be expected from an up-regulation of ATP production requiredby injured cells.In effect, this is mitochondrial resuscitation and it allows mitochon-dria to break the \"vicious cycle\" ofdysfunction and start the process ofrecovery through a cascade of beneficialcellular activity. Through this mecha-nism, post-brain-injury changes tohemodynamics, inflammation, theresulting hypoxia, and decreased ATPproduction are addressed in themitochondria of neurons. Tauproteinpathology Brain trauma results in stressed,hypoxic neurons. Left untreated, theresulting acute state of hypoxia can leadto complex and vicious cycles involvingvarious regions of the brain. Theseinclude a breakdown of the blood-brain barrier, glial cell priming, tau imbalances, and even GIdysregulation via vagal influence. Tau proteins rapidly form after neuronal injury and death as a resultof the aforementioned mitochondrialstress. They have been shown to betoxic to surrounding neurons and glialcells. Tau oligomers initiate the spreadof tau pathology in the brain. Tauoligomers precede the formation ofneurofibrillary tangles (NFT) andcontribute to learning and memorydeficits (and even cell death).Tauproteinopathies can be induced bysingle or repetitive TBI often progressive neurodegeneration progressive supranuclear palsy,dementia, and Alzheimer' s disease. Photobiostimulation can have a powerful mitigating influence on theformation of tau proteins associatedwith traumatic encephalopathy andprogressive neurodegeneration. It hasbeen shown to reverse deposition insome instances, especially in early orimmature tau protein deposits. ClinicaleffectsoftLLLT It is important to remember that oncethe brain is injured, even a short period 18 CHIROPRACTIC ECONOMICS A p r i l 1 8 , 2 0 1 7 CHIROECO.COMCLINICAL CONCERNS of ischemia can cause significant physiological changes with chronic sequelae. This emphasizes the importance of earlyintervention with mTBI and concussion injuries to minimizelong-term risk. Early intervention with tLLLT can effectively address metabolic and biochemical variables to help stabilize andreduce the area of brain injury. As mentioned, it increasesoxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) energy production inhypoxic tissue without a corresponding increase inmitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS.) The result isprevention of additional or secondary loss of stressed andinjured neurons, thereby limiting the area of lesion as wellas activating brain repair pathways. A reduction in cognitivedeficits is also a reported benefit of tLLLT . From a neurobiological perspective, the cascade of beneficial cellular activity includes increased mitochondrialmembrane potential, nitric oxide release, and the modulationof intracellular calcium. Signaling pathways and transcriptionfactors are activated, leading production of anti-apoptotic,pro-proliferation, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, andproangiogenic factors. The regeneration of neurons throughneurogenesis and synaptogenesis aids in the restoration andmaintenance of cognitive function and supportsneuroplasticity during the recovery process. Brain repair is directly affected by the expression of genes related to cell proliferation and indirectly through regulationof the expression of genes related to cell migration andremodeling, DNA synthesis and repair, ion channel andmembrane potential, cell metabolism, and suppression ofapoptosis. Cognitive function benefits by stimulation of these brain repair pathways and reduction of NFT . Neuroplasticity that encourages synaptogen-esis and is significantly upregulated by photobiostimulation.This should be of tremendous benefit for both synaptic andnon-synaptic neuroplastic change, which has significantimplications for posttraumatic learning, memory, andrecovery from brain damage. Moreover, these effects in thebrain suggest tLLLT may have wider applications inneurodegenerative and psychiatric disorders. ClinicalconsiderationsfortLLLT Clinicians working with laser biostimulation should knowthe amount of photon energy (i.e., dosage) measured inmW/cm 2or J/cm2being delivered to the brain. Power and wavelength options will vary between various units andmanufacturers. The delivery of the photon energy will varydepending on wavelength, power, and time to determinepenetration and depth of the target tissue dose. Under- and overstimulation with low level laser application often fails to achieve the desired effect in tissue by either 20 CHIROPRACTIC ECONOMICS A p r i l 1 8 , 2 0 1 7 CHIROECO.COMCLINICAL CONCERNS failing to reach the necessary stimulatory threshold or exceedingbiostimulatory capacity and triggeringinhibitory and braking mechanismswithin the ETC, mitochondria, andcell. Effective tissue dose thresholdsdetermined points to 10 J/cm 2with 1-1.2 J/cm2 considered optimum for maximumCOX activity. Cadaver studies demonstrate that penetration of laser light varies withthe wavelength and, in the 800-to-1,000 nm range common to lasersused in chiropractic offices, is about 2percent. For example, depending onthe unit' s power and other factors, an810 nm laser array may need to deliverabout 60 to reach abrain tissue irradiance of 1-1.2 J/cm 2. Laser manufacturers can provide tissue penetration parameters for theirlaser units and should take intoconsideration the parameters mentionedhere. Calculation of an individualtranscranial therapeutic dose should bemade by the clinician to achieve thedesired 1-1.2 J/cm 2threshold at the depth of the desired tissue to betreated. These should be recorded inthe patient' s chart. Fortunately, tLLLT has been shown to be an extremely safe modality. Over-stimulation, while failing to providetherapeutic benefit, does not adverselyaffect recovery when compared to nolaser treatment. Additionally, tLLLTdoes not adversely affect healthyneurons, so early intervention safety isnot an issue. Atimeforimplementation The standard of medical care for mTBIhas largely limited doctors of chiro-practic to diagnosis and supportivemeasures. But tLLLT is a tool that fillsa significant void in the head and neckinjury-care paradigm and changes thechiropractor' s contribution to integrativemodel protocols by directly andeffectively addressing injury to the CNSin an effective and timely manner.Considering recent research into thebenefit of tLLLT for mTBI, as well asits safety, it is arguably time to remedyan undertreated aspect of chiropractic' sapproach to traumatic neuromuscu-loskeletal patient care.

BY JONATHAN MULHOLLAND, DC NOTHING HAMPERS A PERSON 'S ABILITY TO MOVE MORE THAN foot pain. Y ou can sometimes work around hip issues or lower back symptoms, but foot pain tends to nega-tively affect almost every aspect of life. The human foot is a stubborn part of the body. It can withstand a tremen-dous amount of stress and abuse. Butthis stubbornness can also make it achallenging area to treat. One of the most common foot injuries is plantar fasciitis. The plantarfascia is a thin but extremely strongband of connective tissue that runsalong the bottom of the foot. This fascia attaches at the bottom of the heel, and runs toward the toes,eventually attaching under the ball ofthe foot. Its main purpose is to providesupport to the foot' s arch. Ifoverworked, however, it can becomeinflamed and irritated like any otherpart of the body. Symptomsandetiology The typical symptoms include painunder the bottom of the heel that oftenshoots down the arch toward the toes.W aking barefoot can then be extremelypainful. Almost always, the patientexperiences severe pain with the firstfew steps out of bed in the morning. There are many potential reasons why people develop plantar fasciitis.One of the most common and over-looked causes is restricted dorsiflexionin the big toe or the ankle (or both). Ifyou're not checking the range of motionin these joints, you may be missing themain cause of their plantar fascial pain. The foot is designed to be stable. If you don't have the normal amount ofbig toe and ankle dorsiflexion duringthe push-off phase of gait, your mid-foot will be forced to move excessivelyto make up for the toe and anklerestriction. This leads to increasedstress on the fascia and other soft tissuesin the feet, eventually leading to painand dysfunction. Stepstowardtreatment So what is the fix? Y ou'll likely find thatthis issue responds best to a combi-nation of different treatments andlifestyle modifications. 1. Y oumust evaluate, and treat (if limited), the dorsiflexion of the big toeand the ankle. Most range-of-motion(ROM) limitations are due to a combi-nation of joint restriction and soft-tissue tightness. Y ou need to look atboth of them. As a chiropractor, youshould have several options foraddressing reduced joint motion at thefirst toe and the ankle. Y ou could utilize High-V elocity Low-Amplitude (HVLA) \"Mobilizations withMovement.\" In addition to treating thejoint mobility, you should also treatany soft-tissue restrictions in theregion. Some might prefer acombination of manual myofascialworkand some instrument-assisted soft tissue massage (to the bottom ofthe foot and the calf). 2. After improving their ROM in the toe and ankle, lock-in the improvementwith kinesiology tape. The benefits ofthe tape are wide-ranging, and can helpwith some of the discomfort, provide ADOBE STOCK24 CHIROPRACTIC ECONOMICS A p r i l 1 8 , 2 0 1 7 CHIROECO.COMCLINICAL CONCERNS some support to the mid-foot, and improve proprioception. Consider thetaping technique shown in Figure1. 3. Next, demonstrate how your patient can use a hard ball to performself-massage to the bottom of theirfoot. Put the ball on the floor, step onit with the bad foot, and slowly rollyour foot up and down the ball. Searchfor the most painful spots and spend themost time in those areas. Recommendthat they use a foam roller to do thesame type of massage on their calves.This should be done a few times a dayif possible. See Figure 2. 4. T o address the sharp pain in the morning, your patient needs to purchasesomething called a \"Strassburg Sock. \"It' s a sock they wear while sleeping thatkeeps their toes pulled back towardtheir shin. This keeps the plantar fasciastretched throughout the night and cangreatly reduce the pain in the morning.It can be a bit weird to get used to, butmost people notice a reduction in theirmorning foot pain in five to 10 days. 5. Lastly, stress the importance of applying heat to the bottom of the footas often as possible. Traditionally, thestandard recommendation was to useice. Recent research, however, has calledthat practice into question. It appearsthat connective tissue injuries seem torespond best to heat. Again, plantar fascial pain can be a stubborn condition to treat. Do under-stand that the above list of treatmentoptions is not comprehensive. However,it is a combination of low-tech,inexpensive, and effective treatmentsthat have worked well for me over thepast 15 years. Give this combination atry and see if they work for you.

These \"DIY\" chiropracticpatients are not only detrimental toyour business but also more likely toinjure themselves by performingprocedures that should be done bytrained professionals. However, thereare a number of ways to address thisproblem. Thepatientperspective W alk a mile in your patient' s shoes.What is the first thing they see whenthey are in your office? While you donot want to make the experiencestressful or intimidating, your officeshould reflect your skills and send amessage that you are equipped to domore in-office than they can do athome. Liberally decorate your wallswith diagrams explaining spinalmanipulation and the other servicesyou offer. People are wary of their healthcare providers, especially those who aregoing to be working on an area asdelicate as their spine. Make sure thatevery inch of your office sends outprofessional vibes.In addition, the space where you work with your patients should berelaxing and inviting. While the officeand waiting room should be clinical, itcan be detrimental to your patients'experience if your treatment space istoo medical. W ork on making yourtreatment space an environment whereyour patients feel relaxed and safe. Abriefbutthoroughhistory The most important part of treatmentis to understand the injury that you aredealing with. This will help you notonly to treat it more accurately andquickly but also to properly advise thepatient on how to avoid reinjuringthemselves. Often, injuries due tophysical trauma and everyday repetitivestress are largely aggravated or evencaused by weak foundations and poorhabits.

This helpsyou to retain patients because when theyfeel that you understand them, they aremore likely to come back. T rust betweenpatient and DC is key in the chiro-practic field, and patients who feelheard and understood are much morelikely to show you their loyalty. Reviewtheplan If a patient is not sure exactly wheretheir treatment is going, they will notdeem it worth coming back. Make surethat each patient\u2014especially ones whoare not yet established\u2014knows exactlywhat to expect from each treatment.This will reduce the likelihood that theywill skip sessions or, worse yet, dropyour services entirely. Patients stopservices when they feel that they areno longer required, so it is integral thatyou make them part of the process. This includes talking to them after sessions, ensuring that they know whatto expect next time, and encouragingthem to make regularly scheduledappointments. At the beginning ofyour sessions, it is a good idea to walkthem through the healing process.

This can include anything fromphysical therapy exercises and stretchesto dietary changes. But if you want apatient to come back, make sure theynever leave empty-handed. If they haveconcrete evidence of their progress inthe form of a paper or instructionbooklet, they are more likely to thinkback on their visit with you as a helpfulone, and therefore be more likely toschedule more in the future.

BY S. SCOTT TAUBER, DC, DABCO, CPC AS YOU KNOW FIRSTHAND , CHIROPRACTIC SCHOOLS OFFER little (if any) Personal Injury- specific training. This is true across all healthcare specialties and professions.This lack of training in clinicaldocumentation, case management, andgeneral procedures can becomeproblematic, however, when dealingwith Personal Injury (PI) patients.These issues can also become aproblem for providers who have notkept up with current PI trends. With that in mind, here are five simple yet effective tips that can beimplemented directly into your next PIcase. Doing so can immediately improveyour PI outcomes and success, whilereducing your risk and liability.1.DevelopanewPIpatient-specific telephonescript. Right from the initial telephone call, it is crucial to begin the process of obtaining and gatheringimportant documents and information.PI documentation is quite differentthan that for your other classes ofpatients. Getting the necessarydocuments and information can have asignificant effect on your outcomes. Create a PI script that asks for items that are important to you as a doctor,such as the patient' s medical recordsand relevant injury photographs. Inaddition, capture other information thatcan assist in protecting and assessingthe case. This can include the first- andthird-party insurance carriers, claimnumber(s), adjustor' s name and contactinformation, and attorney name andcontact information (if applicable). Once you have designed your new script, implement accountability meas-ures to ensure your staff completes itin its entirety. This will provide youevidence of consistency in obtainingthis critical information. 2.Obtainpost-collisionmedicalrecords. If your new patient has already been toanother provider before seeing you, avigorous attempt should be made toobtain all of those medical records. It isvital to know exactly what injuries andsymptoms your patient was experi-encing immediately after the collision,as you would record in your office onthe initial visit. Y ou also want to know ADOBE STOCK32 CHIROPRACTIC ECONOMICS A p r i l 1 8 , 2 0 1 7 CHIROECO.COMPRACTICE CENTRAL what treatment and recommendations were offered by other providers. If you identify any symptomatic discrepancies, these should be addressedin your clinical notes along with adetailed explanation. This type ofdiscrepancy is a common argumentmade by the liability carrier. Forexample: If your patient reported onlytwo to three symptoms at the ER orurgent care clinic, but is reporting anextensive list of complaints to you, itcan give the appearance of embellish-ment or exaggeration. Y ou know that physiology explains this, but being proactive and addressingit early with excellent documentation will go a long way toward helping eliminate that potential argument forthose settling the case. 3.Documentyourpatient'ssymptoms duringthehistory. The initial patient history is crucial to PI success. And a critical part of your initial history isdocumenting the patient' s collision-related injuries. This is true even ifthey fall outside your scope of practiceor you do not plan on treating them. Early and complete documentation of injuries and conditions is paramountto any and all future treatments. Thisincludes both in your office and withother providers. Far too many healthcare professionals focus on documentingonly the symptoms that fall withintheir specialty. But failing to documentother presenting injuries andsymptoms can make it difficult foryour patient to subsequently receivecare from other caregivers. Symptoms commonly missed or improperly recorded include; anxiety,confusion, dizziness, loss of appetite,sleep disruption, ringing in the ears, lossof taste or smell, TMJ, and extremitypain. Each one can be reimbursableand, when combined, they can add alot of value to the case settlement. Admittedly, this may take more time than you are used to or be cumbersome.Y ou can, however, develop proceduresor forms for your history to helpexpedite this process. Aside from thesymptom value, a failure to fully docu-ment can have serious ramificationsfor the provider. 4.Considerearlydiagnosticimaging. Acute trauma to the cervical spinerequires a thorough work-up, wellbeyond the normal provider-patient history and examination. Most providers either obtain post-collision plain radi-ographs or take a series of films in theiroffice. In the cervical region, considera minimum of five film series, includingthe flexion and extension views. After taking the initial three cervical films, consider waiting several days toa week before the flexion and extensionviews. This allows for some of theinitial swelling and muscle spasm andguarding to subside. These views canthen be useful in identifying anyligamentous injuries and instability. In addition to plain films, new providers often forget about advancedimaging such as MRI. Ordering anMRI may be unusual for newpractitioners. In the PI arena, however,an MRI can be a relatively inexpensivetool to help document acute traumaticinjuries. It also goes a long way towardprotecting yourself by mitigating risk,liability, and the potential for seriousconsequences. Think of the number of possible causes for the two most common PIsymptoms; headaches and neck pain.Y our physical examination and plain Earlyandcompletedocumentationofinjuries andconditionsisparamounttoanyandallfuturetreatments.34 CHIROPRACTIC ECONOMICS A p r i l 1 8 , 2 0 1 7 CHIROECO.COMPRACTICE CENTRAL radiographs can only identify so much. Conditions such as spinal cord contu-sion, edema, disc injury, High IntensityZone (HIZ), occult fracture, vertebralartery insult\u2014all can cause or mimicthese two symptoms. And these condi-tions may only be demonstrable onan MRI. As a rule, when ordering any diagnostic imaging, it best to have awell-documented clinical rationale. Inaddition, perform the testing early,when there is the greatest chance ofcapturing acute findings. 5.Keepeverythingreasonable. The final tip, especially for new providers, is tokeep everything reasonable. If you arenot familiar with that term, it is allover the medicolegal arena: reasonable person, reasonable bills, reasonable andnecessary, reasonable treatment,reasonably expected to, and so on. Here' s the catch: What is reasonableto one person may not be reasonableto another. One way of looking at\"reasonable\" is to remove yourself fromthe equation. Then take an honest andobjective view of everything, includingyour documentation, care, andtreatment. Reasonable care and treatments in your office are directly under yourcontrol. This includes how many treat-ments, the type of treatments, and thecost associated with those treatments.Many providers approach PI cases,especially those cases with PIP (PersonalInjury Protection) or Med-Pay as a\"bank of funds. \" Some providers feelentitled to all those funds and oftenwill attempt to exhaust them. Thataggressive approach can quickly setyou on the path to unreasonableness. Remember, all PI cases are scruti- nized to some extent. Depending on thespecific case parameters, they may behighly scrutinized. Those that do notadhere to the \"reasonable\" standard mayrapidly find themselves squarely in theauto carrier crosshairs. That can have alitany of unintended consequences. In conclusion, consistent application of these five steps in all your PI caseswill significantly reduce your risk andliability, while improving your caseoutcomes and values. A powerfulsecondary benefit of these actions isthat they also make you moremarketable. S.

Raise your game by observing two basic rules for orgazining your team. Rule number one: Y ou manage systems and you grow people. Rule number two: Culture always wins. T urnover in the chiropractic profession both in staff and associatedoctors is a major topic anytimedoctors of chiropractic get together.And when I'm teaching, the process ofonboarding staff and doctors is one ofthe most frequently asked questions. But before exploring this issue, first consider some of the problems that cancause high turnover. Before you hireeither a staff member or an associatedoctor, you need to have a well-thought-out plan. Do a thorough needs assessment of your practice. Also review if everyoneis currently in the right position. Afterperforming the needs assessment, nextlook at the needs and skill sets for eachposition; each employee should havethe right skills for their position andtheir skills should complement theclinic in general. Based on the needs assessment, you can develop a well-defined job descrip-tion with clear responsibilities anddetermine how those responsibilitiescan be measured. Y our employeehandbook should cover benefits,holidays, and all routine policies andprocedures for the practice. A compre-hensive and detailed onboarding processis essential for both the short- andlong-term success of new employees. Arecipeforstress It is common for doctors to be frus-trated after they go through the effortof hiring and training a staff memberonly to lose them shortly thereafter.They can be flustered by the employee' sdeparture, but in reality it' s often theirpoor preparation that is creating therevolving door. T oo often, a doctor will place the blame for why an employee is leavingon other reasons\u2014higher wages, betterbenefits, or perhaps better hours, butthis might not be the case at all. Whenyou do an exit interview with anemployee, pay close attention if they tellyou they started looking for another job Frommanagertomentor Y our biggest mistake is trying to manage people. BY SCOTT BAUTCH, DC ADOBE STOCK38 CHIROPRACTIC ECONOMICS A p r i l 1 8 , 2 0 1 7 CHIROECO.COMPRACTICE CENTRAL because of your lack of systems, poor management procedures, managementby crisis, poor review procedures, etc.Because in a real sense, your employeesare talking with their feet. Backtosquareone So back up a moment and consider thebetter path. It is critical to have aneffective evaluation system thatidentifies your practice needs, clear jobdescriptions, well-structured onboardingprocesses, and easy-to-understand andup-to-date employee handbooks. Now you have the pieces in place for mentoring your employees, andnote the word is mentoring, not managing. Y ou manage systems, butyou mentor and grow employees if youwant long-term relationships. As mentioned in rule number two, culture is what is created when youmentor and grow the people aroundyou. With a great culture, long-termrelationships with employees becomepossible. How do you create great culture? By understanding the strengths of eachemployee, and recognizing thedynamics that are created throughthose strengths. At the same time, it is also important to understand an employee' s weaknesses.Often, conflict in the clinic happensbecause people do not understand thedifferences among themselves. Forexample: When you're naturally giftedat organization, a person who is notskilled in that area can drive youcrazy\u2014especially if it is the lead doctor. But the person who' s not gifted in organizational skills might be gifted ininteracting with people, and that is avital skill too. It would be nice if wewere all balanced and had the sameabilities, but that' s almost never the case. Given that your employees each have unique abilities, if you can appreciateand understand their individualqualities, you can play off theirstrengths. Then your whole practicewill benefit, including your patients. So if handled right, the differences among your staff can be a tremendous Giventhatyouremployeeseachhaveuniqueabilities, ifyoucanappreciateandunderstandtheirindividualqualities,youcanplayofftheirstrengths.CHIROECO.COM A p r i l 1 8 , 2 0 1 7 CHIROPRACTIC ECONOMICS 39 asset to your practice. But if mishandled, they can lead to a rotating carousel ofnew hires. You'rethecoach The last topic is the ongoing relationshipyou have with your employees; you needto have something you can measure, aperformance point at each position thatyou can use for coaching. Without asystem of coaching, employer-employeeinteractions tend to focus on thingsgoing wrong. When the numbers are up in patient care and you're paying your bills withthe extra left over, everybody is happy.When things get tough, you might betempted to start micromanaging. Y oucan avoid this by applying consistentand agreed-upon systems to interactwith each employee individually andyour team collectively. Some clinics, whether large or small, may want to outsource this processbecause they don't have the time orskills available to enact them. Newclinics may need expert advice toaccomplish the process of coachingemployees effectively and efficiently. Healthyself It' s been said that DCs spend too muchtime working ina clinic, and take too little time to work ona clinic. Without continually evaluating your systemsand mentoring and growing yourpeople, your practice can becomesomething like the movie Groundhog Day: the same problems, repeating over and over again. Y ou can sidestep that outcome by engaging in a well-thought-out needsassessment for each position that relatesto the goals of your practice. From thatneeds assessment, write up a concisejob description and expectations foreach employee. From the job descrip-tion and expectations, develop youronboarding process. And a key part of the onboarding process is your developing an under-standing of the strengths of theemployee you just hired. All currentemployees need to learn the newemployee' s natural skills and abilities,and vice versa.

Ultimately, adding a PT increases the number of services your practicecan provide. \"It also enables patients toreceive comprehensive care, particularlythose who've just had surgery or thosewho are looking to prevent undergoingsurgery to increase their function, \" shesays. Firststep\u2014followthelaw If you're considering adding a PT orother type of healthcare provider, beginby researching your state' s laws andregulations that govern the possiblearrangements, such as hiring theindividual as an employee or as anindependent contractor, says Scott Fonda, DC, DABCO, of Sports Medicine Solutions. Contact a healthcare attorney who knows what your state' s law allows,because every state is different, says JoelDekanich, DC, RN, MS, DACBSP ,and founder and director of the V ailIntegrative Medical Group. There areboth federal and state laws that achiropractic practice must follow whenemploying a practitioner from anotherdiscipline. \"In some states you can employ a PT , and in others you can't, \" Dekanichcontinues. \"There are pluses andminuses to both types of arrangements.Employing a healthcare provider as anemployee versus an independentcontractor is a cleaner arrangement, asall providers will function as one entityunder one tax identification number. \" Attorneys can also help you navigate Stark law and anti-kickback statutes.Physical therapy and chiropracticassociations can serve as resources aswell, Higashi adds. By hiring someone as an employee (if your state permits it), you won'tviolate Stark law if the chiropractorand employed PT both see a patient.\" Any PT services provided must bebilled under the practice' s tax identifi-cation number, with the PT' s (NPI) as theprovider, \" Fonda says. \"The chiro-practor' s services are billed under thepractice' s tax identification numberwith the chiropractor' s NPI as theprovider. Y ou can pay the PT as eithera full-time salaried employee or on anhourly basis. \" If the PT is an independent contractor, however, then the arrange-ment is quite different. Each providerhas his or her own corporate structure(e.g., a limited liability corporation, Ccorporation, or S corporation) and taxidentification number. Any referralsbetween providers cannot be incen-tivized. \"In this scenario, the PT simplyleases space in the chiropractic clinicfor a standardized rate that cannot belinked to revenue, \" Fonda says. \"Forexample, the chiropractor could chargea flat fee for renting clinic space, butthe rent charged cannot be based on apercentage of collections. Make sure toconsult your attorney to draft anindependent contractor agreement. \" Scoutingtalent After you've determined in whatcapacity you want to bring on a PT , it' stime to begin your search for one.Dekanich places advertisements on theAmerican Academy of Physical Therapywebsite, as this strategy works well forhim. He' s found many recent physicaltherapy graduates look for jobs there. Ifyou're seeking to add a personal trainer,advertise at a local gym or onCraigslist. For Fonda, effective ways to find PT s include getting referrals fromcolleagues or patients, contacting a localuniversity with a PT or doctor of PTprogram, and attending multidisci-plinary conferences or post-graduateseminars with both chiropractic andPT attendees. Activecare What it takes to add a physical therapist to your practice. BY KAREN APPOLDCHIROECO.COM A p r i l 1 8 , 2 0 1 7 CHIROPRACTIC ECONOMICS 41 ADOBE STOCK42 CHIROPRACTIC ECONOMICS A p r i l 1 8 , 2 0 1 7 CHIROECO.COMSpencerBaron, DC, DACBSP , president of NeuroSport Elite, has found PT s through referrals from otherrespected PT s, especially those who haveworked in collegiate and professionalsports. Greatexpectations By bringing on a new healthcareprovider, you should expect somechanges\u2014for the better. \"Hands down,the first change a practice shouldexpect is better patient outcomes, \"Dekanich says. \"There is ample evidencein peer-reviewed literature that whenchiropractic techniques, manual soft-tissue techniques, and manual therapytechniques are combined with physicaltherapy and exercise, patients get betterresults. The PT focuses on rehabili-tation and discharges the patient whenthey reach maximum medicalimprovement and the chiropractor canfocus on wellness and supportive care.The marriage works well. \"Aside from an increased revenue stream, the PT can provide addedrehabilitation benefits that wouldtypically tie up the chiropractor' s time.\"Because my practice is oriented towardtreating sports injuries, the model hasbeen exercised at the collegiate and prolevel with excellent results, \" Baron says. AccommodatingaPT Whether or not you need more spacefor a PT largely depends on the PT' spractice style and patient demographics.\"On the lower end of the spectrum, asolo PT working one-on-one with apatient in a low-tech rehabilitationsetting could operate with a treatmenttable and some low-tech rehab equip-ment, such as stretch-bands, exercisetubing, and a gym ball, \" Fonda says.\" At the upper end of the spectrum, youcould construct an entire rehabilitationfacility to service a range of patienttypes. \" AlanK.Sokoloff, DC, DACBSP , director of the Y alich Clinic Perform-ance and Rehabilitation Center, hasfound that PT s and chiropractors sharea lot of the same rehab equipment. \"Ifthe PT does specific techniques,different machines or products may benecessary, \" he says. For example, at hispractice, the chiropractic staff doesn'tuse phonophoresis or iontophoresismodalities, but the PT team uses bothregularly. In his practice, the PT depart-ment shares space with the chiropractorsand chiropractic rehabilitation assistants. Dekanich says his 1,500-square-foot clinic can accommodate several treat-ment rooms, a massage room, and anopen physical therapy room. The PTrequires simple equipment, becausemost rehabilitation is done with low-tech gear such as stretching-bands andfree weights, as well as some resistancetraining. Low-tech rehabilitation, in addition to having a minimal start-up cost, is agreat way to help patients comply withperforming their PT regimen, as it doesnot require high-tech equipment,Higashi says. A space ranging from 100to 500 square feet suffices for most PT s. Of course, you can add high-end physical therapy equipment such asweight machines, foam mats, exercisebikes, elliptical machines, treadmills,and computerized physical therapyequipment as your PT departmentdevelops and expands. Sales of rehab equipment to patients assigned home exercise might serve asa potential source of revenue. \"While itprobably won't be a large contributingfactor to revenue, it is important to havemore commonly used supplies available,because having immediate access tothese items (e.g., resistance bands, foamrolls, or exercise balls) can improvepatients' adherence to prescribed homeexercise programs, \" Fonda says. Expandingyourpatient demographic By having a PT join your practice, you may be able to see patients whonormally wouldn't come to your door.\"Because we are an extremity specialistgroup and sports medicine specialists,our demographic didn't change thatmuch (when adding a PT), \" Dekanichsays. \"But for practices that maintain aPT to see post-surgery patients, suchas those who've had shoulder or kneesurgery, a different segment of patientswill seek out your practice, as the stan-dard of care is to refer these patients toa PT , not a chiropractor. But not allphysical therapy patients will end upseeing a chiropractor; PT s can havetheir own patient bases. \" According to Higashi, any demo- graphic changes will depend on thePT' s skill set. For example, a PT whospecializes in sports medicine will tendto bring in younger patients with sportsinjuries. PT s who specialize in geriatricswill bring in more elderly patients. PT swho focus on women' s health couldbring in more female patients.

In addition to referring patients in your practice to other specialists, you may be able to gain referrals outside of yourpractice from orthopedic surgeons, primary care physicians,and other healthcare providers. \"If these providers hearabout your practice' s great results, they will be more likely torefer patients, \" Higashi says. \"But being in-network withinsurance carriers also plays a big part in referrals. If yourPT has a great reputation but is not in a patient' s network,due to the high cost of insurance many patients will choosean in-network provider. \" Whatcouldpossiblygowrong? Although adding a PT can be advantageous in many ways,there could be some potential downsides, such as personalityconflicts among healthcare providers. \"The relationshipbetween the chiropractor and PT should not be adversarial,territorial, or competitive, \" Fonda says. \"The two providersshould acknowledge that they have overlapping skill setsand use that as a common ground. Their individual andunique talents and skills, when combined to improve apatient' s quality of life, is a recipe for improving inter-professional relations and creating a personally rewardingand financially successful practice. \" Along these lines, Dekanich says it' s all about a good fit. \"Hire the right person first, \" he says. \"Make sure your treat-ment philosophies are similar and that you are both on thesame page before you hire someone. \" He stresses that youand the PT need to be team-oriented, putting the patients'interests first. The arrangement won't work if either providerprefers to practice alone. \" All healthcare providers need to check their ego at the door, \" Dekanich continues: \"Chiropractors have certain skillsets that they have been trained in and are better at thanPT s\u2014and vice versa. In our clinic, we don't allow PT s to domanipulation, that' s a chiropractor' s job.

Providers need to figure out who doeswhat best, and make it a collaborativeapproach. But make sure you don'tduplicate services. \" Higashi says disagreements in philosophies and approaches totreatment and care can occur, resultingin mixed or confusing messages topatients. In addition, fee splitting, anti-kickback regulations, and incorrectreimbursements could becomecompliance issues potentially leadingto penalties and fines. Makingitwork Regardless of the capacity in whichyou maintain a PT , your practice needsa team-oriented approach rather thanhaving the PT feel as if he or sheworks for the chiropractor. Typically,PT s join an orthopedic group or largehospital group after graduation.W orking for a chiropractor is some-what nontraditional. \"So, making itmore about a team effort and having amultidisciplinary model will be moresuccessful than having the PT feel as ifthey work for the chiropractor, \"Dekanich says. Allow the PT to devise his or her own treatment protocols for rehab,core stability work, and spinal stability.\"Let them use their autonomy andskills sets, \" Dekanich says. \"W e collab-orate daily and our treatment plans arevery dynamic; there is constant dialogueand we are always reviewing treatmentprotocols. \" In addition, ensure the PT you find is one who complements your practice.\"That may be someone who sees asimilar patient demographic to yours,who can add value to your manualskills by expanding the rehabilitationcomponent, or perhaps it is a PT whospecializes in a patient population verydifferent from yours\u2014which adds atotally new service that your clinic nowprovides in your community, \" Fondasays. Doing so will increase yourexposure, widen your market, andexpand your referral sources.

For times between office visits, patients need a natural inter-vention that addresses the need forjoint repair, pain reduction, andstopping inflammation. Conventional treatments center on stopping the pain\u2014an importantconsideration to be sure, but it doesn'tget to the root of the problem. Plus,pharmaceutical responses can oftenbring about potentially dangerous sideeffects or have addictive properties,and don't address the need for positivelifestyle changes or help to rebuilddamaged tissue. While glucosamine sulfate has been helpful, there are other ingredients thatare even more beneficial for yourpatients: curcumin, boswellia, anddevil' s claw. Each is strong in its ownright, but in combination they addressthe key areas of rebuilding jointstructure, reducing damaging inflam-mation, and reducing pain. Curcumincure Curcuminoids are well-knowncompounds from turmeric (Curcuma longa) that play a dual role in reducing the inflammation that destroys jointmobility and flexibility. They protectchondrocytes (the specialized cellsfound in joint cartilage) from beingbroken down by inflammatorycompounds such as IL-1beta andMMP3, and simultaneously stop painwithout causing side effects. 1-4When curcumin is combined with turmericessential oil (a source of beneficialanti-inflammatory turmerones) itenhances absorption and you may findit increases efficacy as well. 5,6 In fact, one study found that compared to a drug intervention(diclofenac sodium) for rheumatoidarthritis, whether curcumin withessential oil was combined with themedication or simply in a regimen ofits own, it was superior to the drug. Inboth curcumin groups, there were nodropouts due to adverse effects, but inthe diclofenac sodium group, 14 percentwithdrew due to adverse effects. 2 The results of the Disease Activity Score in 28 Joints (DAS28) patientassessments showed even morebeneficial effects.

For pain relief, nearly 65 percent of those taking the herbal ingredientsversus 30 percent in the drug groupimproved to such a high degree thatthey were able to shift from having\"moderate to severe arthritis\" to \"mildto moderate arthritis. \" 3Jointrelief Boswellia (Boswellia serrata) is especially potent at reducing joint pain.It inhibits the inflammatory enzyme,5-LOX, which makes it a rarity evenamong other strong anti-inflammatorybotanicals. When boswellia is stan-dardized to be low in beta-boswellicacid (which interferes with beneficialactivity) and provide higher levels ofAKBA, it increases its effectiveness. 5,6 In fact, this is the form that was usedin the clinical study of osteoarthritiswith curcumin. 3 Another botanical, devil' s claw (Harpagophytum procumbens), is a must for practitioners to recommendfor restoring joints and improvingflexibility. In a clinical study publishedin thePhytomedicine , devil' s claw relieved hip pain by almost 55 percentand knee pain by 40 percent in eightweeks. 7In another German clinical study, devil' s claw was equal in pain-relieving ability to rofecoxib, betterknown to pain sufferers non-steroidal anti-inflam-matory (NSAID) that has sincebeen pulled from the market becauseof its side effects. 8One of the reasons for this is that the plant' s keycompounds, harpagosides, can reduceCOX-2 activity by 31 percent. 9 Aside from fighting inflammation, a standardized devil' s claw with 20 percentharpagosides has been shown to helpincrease the level of glycosaminoglycans(GAGs) by 38 percent. 10It has also been shown to boost hyaluronic acidsynthesis in chondrocytes (the cellsthat produce and maintain cartilagebetween the vertebrae and joints) by41 percent. 11 The botanicals discussed here have a long history of traditional use that isbeing confirmed in clinical studies andongoing research. They provide practi-tioners and patients alike with an 52 CHIROPRACTIC ECONOMICS A p r i l 1 8 , 2 0 1 7 CHIROECO.COMWELLNESS APPROACH effective and viable alternative to pharmaceuticals, without complications and side effects, to help promote an active,vibrant life.

As costs continue to escalate beyond affordability, many chiropractors sit motionless intheir offices like those on the Titanic , hoping everything will be OK. Butyour future success in the chiropracticmarket will be guided by the decisionsyou make today regarding theeconomic model of your practice. Unfortunately, for many chiro- practors, this decision will be based onfear rather than strategy. As costscontinue to climb, many chiropractorschoose the path of least resistance anddecide to get rid of X-rays (insurancedoesn't pay for them), get rid of staff(constant cost regardless of weeklyincome fluctuations), and stop takinginsurance (too much work with billing,must have malpractice insurance, toostressful with patients). All of thesechoices are made out of fear and lack ofbusiness maturity, and in most cases willlead to a struggling or failed practice. The key to succeeding in the practice of the future is to build two boats, onethat participates with the availableinsurance coverage out there, and theother that builds the cash-based, out-of-pocket practice. Both require signifi-cantly different attitudes and guidelines,but both can lead to a more securefuture in an unstable industry. Andthese strategies can also lead to long-term practice and personal success. Cash-onlypractice Most offices that have become strictlycash-based generally reached this stateout of fear and the lack of a goodbusiness plan. It' s easier just to get ridof the insurance CA, stop the pain ofgetting rejections from insurancecompanies, and make people pay onthe spot for their services so the officedoesn't have to wait for reimbursement.It' s not unlike someone getting out of acontentious marriage who vows to nevermarry again. They just don't want togo through that type of pain any more.So, they sit alone the rest of their lifethinking it is best option available. The truth is, this practitioner needs a developmental program that teachesthe laws of business and the guidelinesrequired for a successful practicerelying on both insurance and cash relationships. Giving up the insurancepipeline, when so many people arecovered for so many services, isshortsighted and not recommended ifLookintothefuture An efficient cash and insurance practice is achievable. BY TIM MAGGS, DCADOBE STOCK62 CHIROPRACTIC ECONOMICS A p r i l 1 8 , 2 0 1 7 CHIROECO.COMMONEY MANAGEMENT long-term future success is your goal. Likewise, building a practice that depends 100 percent on inflated third-party pay is like playing musical chairs. It can change by the minute, and if you're left standing (i.e.,dependent on them for all your income), there is a high riskyour practice will seriously suffer if the industry makes amajor change. This is also not a recommended approach tolong-term future success. Thegood,thebad,andtheuglyofacash-onlypractice At first glance, a cash-only practice seems like a great idea.Never having to deal with frustrating insurance companies isa tempting proposition. Dropping malpractice insurancepremiums will certainly help the bottom line. Less stress, asmaller staff, and an end to rejections would make life a loteasier. However, the major downside of this type of practiceis also less income. The insurance industry pays rates much higher than what the general population can afford. Assuming there were nostress in filling out insurance forms, mailing them in, andhaving them reimbursed, any office would welcome thegreater rate of pay (albeit the rates are lower today). But thestresses of working with insurance companies cost everypractice. They affect the mood, workload, and motivation ofan office, among other things. So you have to weigh thebenefits versus the costs to determine if participating withinsurance is worth the headaches. Good organization and clinical procedures will help make participation with insurance companies more palatable.Offices that have weak procedures and poor documentationwill always have a stressful relationship with insurers. Butoffices that have strong procedures and good documen-tation have far fewer problems with insurance companies. In addition, honesty with patients regarding their liability and the responsibility of their insurance company also helpsto make an insurance practice workable. The practice thatcan only work with people who have superb coverage, anddoesn't know how to work with people who have highdeductibles and high co-pays, will never find it easy to workwithin insurance guidelines. An example of how not to do it is the practice that only suggests custom orthotics when they see the patient hassome type of coverage for them. This is a backward andfailure-oriented strategy. The successful practitioner Thesuccessfulpractitionerexamines patientsanddeterminestheirneedswithoutregardforwhatthepatients'insurancecovers.64 CHIROPRACTIC ECONOMICS A p r i l 1 8 , 2 0 1 7 CHIROECO.COMMONEY MANAGEMENT examines patients and determines their needs without regard for what thepatients' insurance covers.Recommendations are based onpatient needs, not patient coverage. For something like orthotics, the best way to do this is by using visualevidence, such as a digital scanner. Thisway patients can see and understandthe imbalances in their feet and thedetrimental effect it has on their totalmusculoskeletal system. Y ou can thendescribe the eventual effects of theseimbalances if they are not corrected.Because they then understand the needfor orthotics, they may be more willingto pay out of pocket for them. Publicperceptioninseekingcare The number one question the publicasks when they call your office is, \"Is itcovered by my insurance?\" T o say \"No\"ends most relationships before youever have a chance to build one. Thepublic is oftentimes willing to acceptsub-quality care if their insurance onlyextend that far. So rejecting insurance,especially in these hard economictimes, should not be a consideration\u2014especially by new practitioners. Once you get the patient in your office, anything is possible. They mayend up spending an exorbitant amountof money out of pocket because they'regiving you a chance to show them whyyou are the preferred provider in theirarea. Theinsurancepractice This is a component of a practice thatrequires skill, patience, dedication,communication, organization, andresilience. All of these qualities areneeded to be successful in life. Y ouroffice should not flee from working withinsurance companies to avoid thehassles. Instead, accept the challenge ofdeveloping this business model andhelp more people. Y et a major problem with offices that accept insurance is that they don'tspend time on improving their skills atdeveloping the cash-based, out-of-pocket portion of their practice. Don't take the easy road. Use all possible programs available for morepatients to come into your office. Thisis the key to building a secure practicefor the future.

CHIROECO.COM A p r i l 1 8 , 2 0 1 7 CHIROPRACTIC ECONOMICS 67DO YOU CURRENTLY OFFER REHABILITATION SERVICES OR physical therapy to patients in your practice but are unhappy with the return? Are you unsure about who canperform rehab services in your state? Isyour practice in compliance with stateand federal regulations? And how dorehab services integrate with a cash-based practice? If you are thinking about adding rehab to your clinic or are havingproblems making it profitable, thisquiz just might have the answers toyour questions. Knowthedifference Many doctors make the mistake ofusing physical therapy interchangeablywith rehab in their notes\u2014andsometimes in their marketing. Be awarethat they are notthe same. Strictly speaking, physical therapy consists ofpassive modalities such as heat andelectrical stimulation, and exercisesperformed by a physical therapist.Rehab therapy may consist of the samemodalities and exercises, but it is notnecessarily performed by a physicaltherapist. This distinction has relevanceto marketing and compliance andbilling issues. In most states, a chiropractor can perform rehab therapy; it' s within thescope of practice. In some states this islimited to the spine. An importantexception is Medicare, which will onlypay for rehab or physical therapyservices performed by or under thedirect supervision of a licensedphysical therapist or physical therapyassistant. These rules have important ramifi- cations for billing and documentation.If a chiropractor is billing for servicesperformed personally, then it shouldbe billed with the chiropractor as theprovider and specified as rehab andnot physical therapy. Whoisdoingwhat? Another issue is billing for rehabservices performed by athletic trainers,massage therapists, and other non-physical therapist providers under thedirect or indirect supervision of achiropractor. Medicare strictly enforcesthe rules relating to who can performphysical therapy and applies them tothe person who is actually performingCHIROBIZQUIZ Forcemultiplier Making rehab work in the integrated practice. BY MARC H. SENCER, MDADOBE STOCK68 CHIROPRACTIC ECONOMICS A p r i l 1 8 , 2 0 1 7 CHIROECO.COMCHIROBIZ QUIZ the therapy (regardless of who is supervising). Private payers have been increasingly asking who exactly is performing the therapy and they are denying claims for therapy performed by non-physical therapists, but billedunder a directly or indirectly supervising chiropractor. Inone case, a practice was asked to provide the license numberof the person performing the service. T o make mattersworse, this principle has been applied both to pre-paymentaudits leading to denials and to post-payment audits leadingto requests for returns of payments made. Y ou may be wondering if this also applies to therapy performed under the supervision of an MD. The answer is\"yes\" in most cases, because massage therapists and trainersare not licensed to perform physical therapy. Medicare willpay for such \"incident to\" services under an MD, but onlywhen performed by a licensed nurse practitioner, physicaltherapist, or certified nurse specialist. Of course, doing itthis way would be extremely unprofitable. Makingthesale The person doing the therapy has important implicationsfor marketing. The physical therapy lobby is strong and theyhave succeeded in getting laws passed in many statesforbidding the advertising of physical therapy and evenphysiotherapy services, except those performed by licensedphysical therapists. They are highly protective of their turf. There are cases in which chiropractors have advertised physical therapy services and have had complaints lodged bycompetitors to their boards. In several cases, this occurredeven though the chiropractor had a physical therapistworking in the practice. This is less of a problem in bigcities, but should be considered by those in a rural orsuburban practice. Following the rules will generally provideyou with immunity from such frivolous complaints. Theroadtointegration There are three main paths to integrating rehab in yourpractice. First, you can hire a PT but not have an MD in thepractice (DC-PT practice). Second, you can have both PT sand MDs in the practice (DC-MD-PT practice). Or third,you can do it yourself or hire another DC to do rehab andbill care as chiropractic for those states where it is in thescope of your license. Hiring the PT without having an MD has the advantage of being less expensive, but there are some disadvantages tothe DC-PT setup. The main drawback is that you will notbe able to do rehab with Medicare patients. This negates oneof the biggest advantages of having a MD on board. Only anMD can write a prescription for physical therapy forMedicare patients. This opens up another world of patientsyou have not been able to see profitably as a chiropractor. There are some cases where chiropractors have been able 70 CHIROPRACTIC ECONOMICS A p r i l 1 8 , 2 0 1 7 CHIROECO.COMCHIROBIZ QUIZ to make a DC-PT practice work by having a close relationship with afamily doctor or orthopedic surgeonwho would work closely with them,and write the Medicare PTprescriptions, but you will definitelylose complete control once the patientleaves the office. There may also besome legal issues with such a referralarrangement. It is thus recommended to hire anMD and a PT for maximumprofitability and flexibility. Anexception to this would be if you onlywant to see PI patients in a state wherethe reimbursement is the same forservices performed by a chiropractorthey are for MDs or PT s for PIpatients. And opening your practice todifferent types of clients is a goodhedge against decreased reimburse-ments by the various third-party payers. Increasedopportunities Providing physical therapy and medicalservices reimbursed by Medicare andprivate insurance, such as trigger pointand joint injections, can open the doorto adding cash-based physicalmedicine services. These might includeplatelet enriched plasma injections,stem cell therapy, IV therapy, lasertherapy, and spinal decompression. If you are not doing rehabilitation and physical therapy in your office butare thinking about adding some cash-based services, now is the time toconsider the possibilities. MARC H. SENCER , MD, is the president of MDs for DCs, which provides intensive one-on-onetraining, medical staffing, andongoing practice management support to chiropractic integrated practices.He can be contacted at 800-916-1462 orthrough mdsfordcs.com. Testyourself T est your knowledge of adding rehab services with this true and false quiz. 1. Medicare will pay for pT services performed by a licensed massagetherapist under the direct supervisionof an MD. 2. Having an MD on board opens the door to more cash-based services. 3. poor compliance can leave you vulnerable to attacks from yourcompetitors. 4. Third-party payers may recoup payments made for physical therapyservices done by unlicensedpersonnel. Answers: The first statement is false. Medicare will only reimburse if the therapy isactually performed by a physicaltherapist. if performed incident to anMD, it must be done by a nursepractitioner, physician assistant, orcertified nurse specialist with trainingin physical therapy. 72 CHIROPRACTIC ECONOMICS A p r i l 1 8 , 2 0 1 7 CHIROECO.COMIN MY FIRST TRIMESTER AT NEW YORKCHIROPRACTIC COLLEGE,ALL incoming first-year students were assigned a student mentor. The advice mine gave me was: \"Y ou must takecare of yourself if you're going to takecare of others. \" In that spirit, here aresome techniques to keep you on top ofyour health even when the demands ofchiropractic school and beginningpractice become overwhelming. Get into a routine and stick to it: For example, if you are a morning person,get up before your first class ormorning shift to go to the gym or for arun. This is your sacred time, and onceyour routine is established, breaking itbecomes difficult. Even better, commit to a routine with a friend. Not only will you bothlook forward to it, but you'll motivateeach other. Y ou'll find that when youstart the day with any type of exercise,the rest of the day you'll be happierand more energetic. \" Neededdowntime Adequate sleep is necessary for avariety of reasons when you are inschool. It offers enhanced memory,better attention and learning, anddecreased anxiety and depression.True, you might have to cram thenight before a big exam, even if thatmeans pulling an all-nighter. However, cutting your sleep short can result in not only poor testperformance but also weight gain andlowered immune system resistance. Ifyou have difficulty getting or stayingasleep, avoid alcohol and otherprescription sedatives. Chiropractic school, especially the first trimester, can be very stressful. Theimmense amount of reading, studying,and test taking make you feel like you'realways playing catch-up. And whileexercise and sleep are vital, havingclose relationships is just as valuable. Many of start school without knowing anyone, but building healthyrelationships with other students overtime can significantly improve yourquality of life while away from home. Getoutandabout When possible, get out and experienceyour new home. The change in scenery,even if for a few hours, can impact youtremendously. It can reduce your stresslevels while sparking creativity andputting you in contact with peopleoutside of school. One of the best ways to take care of your self is by eating healthy. Thecafeteria at school usually offers bothhealthy and unhealthy foods; it' s up toyou to choose what to eat. Mealsshould consist of a lean protein andvegetables and a serving of unprocessedgrains for each meal. By choosing to eat healthy early on in your career you will not onlypractice what you preach and representthe profession well, but also practicedisease prevention. Consider visiting some chiropractors in private practice. After completingyour first year of school, look to observeand volunteer in some practices closeto your college. If you can, visit\"straight\" offices, rehabilitation-typepractices that work with orthopedicsurgeons, spinal correction practices,and nutrition-based practices. Learn from each style and create what you believe works best. It is vitalto apply what you learn in school withwhat you observe in real practice. Y ou read a lot in school, and are probably good at skimming overmultiple pages of information. Y oumight find that you rarely read inchiropractic school for pleasure. Aftergraduation you'll still have to read a lotpertaining to work, includingprofessional journals, reading foradditional certifications, reviewingmedical records, and updates tochanges in healthcare laws. Help your future patients and lead by example. Practice what you preachby having a healthy diet, exerciseroutine, and sleep schedule. Cultivateand cherish the friendships you buildat school because they can last you alifetime. Get out of your comfort zoneand visit chiropractors in privatepractice for real-world experience. Andnever forget about or give up on yourquest for knowledge. LOUIS MILLER , DC, MS, is the owner and operator of Advanced Chiropractic of South Florida andHealthy Weight Solutions.
