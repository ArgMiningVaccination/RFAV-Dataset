Chiropractic Articles What is a spine? Lesson One Your back is composed of 33 bones called vertebrae, 31 pairs of nerves, 40 muscles, and numerous connecting tendons and ligaments running from the base of your skull to your tailbone. Between your vertebrae are fibrous elastic cartilage pads called disks. These shock absorbers keep your spine flexible, and cushion the hard vertebrae as you move. Many pains can be alleviated with chiropractory or [Massage Therapy Vancouver WA](https://www.yoderchiropracticcenter.com/massage-therapy-vancouver-wa/). The Most Important Idea Having a clear understanding of the intelligence within our bodies is the most important concept for us to understand when considering how to best care for our health. We each have a central nervous system composed of the brain and the vast network of nerves, through which the brain communicates and controls the workings of our organs, tissues, and cells. Throughout our bodies, even within the tiniest cell, is a universal intelligence, the power that gives life and organization to all matter. [Chiropractic](https://www.yoderchiropracticcenter.com/) is based on this concept. A vertebra which is shifted out of place chokes off the nerves, thus interfering with the communication between the brain and the body. Adjusting the spine places the vertebrae in the proper alignment, removing the interference, restoring the proper function of the nervous system. The power is \"turned on\" and it is this power that heals the body. The power that made the body heals the body. The Major Premise: A universal intelligence is in all matter and continually gives to all it's properties and actions, thus maintaining it in existence. Bears and Spaghetti Lets take a moment to think about food. What did you eat today? If you are like most Americans, your meals included many refined starches such as bread, cookies, and chips. Even home cooked meals are largely composed of starchy, high carbohydrate foods. Quick and easy is the way to go these days, and our go-to foods are things like mac'n'cheese, boxed pasta, and spaghetti. What about bears? Bears are omnivores just like we are. What do bears eat? According to animal planet, bears eat all the healthy foods that nature provides to them; berries, nuts, honey, meat, fish, grass, seeds, roots, fresh plants etc. All their nutritional needs are met just by eating whole, unprocessed, fresh foods. Consider how we would benefit from eating the food we were designed to eat. Next time you are going to grab a quick meal or snack, ask yourself, \"Would a bear eat this?\" Think! Speak! Must!

It need not be this way, health is still available to those who pursue it. We will make a difference, help those who will accept it, teach those who want to learn, offer hope to those without. Within each one of us is the God-given potential to thrive, to excel, to live! If we share our gifts with others, they can do the same in turn, and the result is a powerful force, far reaching and without boundaries. It begins with one. So, \"Think! Speak! Act Positive! I Am!
