Various nutritional and herbal supplements, in conjunction with specific dietary strategies (juicing and/or modified fasts), can be very effective in purging the body of toxins that have accumulated over the years. In addition, we will occasionally recommend a Liver/Gall Bladder Flush in order to give the entire GI tract a rest while allowing damaged epithelial cells to repair themselves and improving the ability of the GI tract to absorb nutrients. This \"flush\" enables the liver to more efficiently break down and eliminate stored toxins. In many cases, we will recommend a modified fast and/or Liver/Gall Bladder Flush after completion of any antimicrobial (either herbal or pharmaceutical) use to destroy pathogenic intestinal organisms, the idea being that after the kill off, there needs to be a clean out. It is very soon after a successful detoxification program that many patients note the greatest improvement in their symptoms with the elimination of most fatigue, body aches, muscle pain, joint aches, and any GI distress. Chelation Therapy Toxic metals such as mercury, lead, arsenic and cadmium can accumulate in the body over time and exact a heavy toll on health and well-being. Metals such as lead, manganese, aluminum, and mercury have proved to be neurotoxic (toxic to the brain) and are suspected of promoting heart disease and long-term neurodegenerative problems such as Alzheimer's disease. For example, the list of cardiovascular problems that have been linked with mercury toxicity is extensive, including hypertension, coronary heart disease, heart attack, cardiac arrhythmias, carotid artery blockage, strokes, atherosclerosis, and reduced heart rate variability, as reported in the August 2011 Journal of Clinical Hypertension. Many people show dramatic improvements in their health when these metals are removed with the help of chelation therapy and other methods. Toxic metal removal includes a combination of strategies, notably chelation therapy (IV and oral) and use of various natural compounds that accelerate the elimination of metals stored in the bones, central nervous system and other tissues. Research reported in the 15 April 2007 issue of Cellular & Molecular Biology indicates that chelation therapy is most effective when combined with specific antioxidant nutrients and herbals to support optimal detoxification. Other oral strategies may be used to accelerate toxic metal removal beyond what can be accomplished with chelation therapy alone. Hyperbaric Therapy Hyperbaric Therapy is the use of oxygen (or air) at greater than atmospheric pressure, resulting in an increase in oxygen concentration in all tissues of the body. Under these circumstances, no energy is needed to deliver the oxygen into tissues as opposed to normal circumstances with numerous energy- requiring steps being necessary for the movement of oxygen through the lungs, into hemoglobin, and into cells. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy is currently indicated as an important adjunctive therapy for: - Radiation Tissue Damage (Soft Tissue and Osteoradionecrosis) - Clostridial Myonecrosis (Gas Gangrene) - Compromised Skin Grafts and Flaps - Crush Injury, Compartment Syndrome, and Acute Traumatic Ischemias - Necrotizing Soft Tissue (Subcutaneous, Muscle, Fascia) Infections - Osteomyelitis (Refractory to antibiotics) - Problem Non-Healing Wounds Hormone Replacement & Longevity Medicine With age come progressive reductions in most or all hormones that your body produces. These changes include estrogen, progesterone, testosterone, thyroid hormones, DHEA and other adrenal hormones, as well as hormones made in the brain, including melatonin and growth hormone. In order to help your body function more like it did when you were younger, you need to recover those more youthful hormone levels. Thus, replacement of hormone deficiencies can have dramatic effects not only on your overall health, vitality and quality of life, but also in terms of preventing illnesses in the future. Among the main hormonal therapies we offer are the following: - Bioidentical estrogen and progesterone replacements for menopausal women, offering the greatest protection from cancer and heart disease compared to synthetic hormones such as Premarin. - Natural progesterone replacement for pre-menopausal women experiencing PMS, skin problems, menstrual cramps, and other symptoms of estrogen dominance. - Testosterone replacement for both men and women for improved muscle strength, stamina, mental function, mood, and sexual function. - DHEA replacement for stabilization of all hormones and support of testosterone levels. - Natural thyroid hormone replacements to include pharmaceutical and herbal therapies along with detailed laboratory testing to identify those with clinical hypothyroidism and hypometabolism. - Therapies to address adrenal dysfunction, both hypo and hyper function, both conditions associated with chronic stress. - Replacement of human growth hormone for treatment of documented growth hormone deficiencies in patients with age related degenerative conditions. Targeted Nutritional & Herbal Therapies Nutritional and herbal medicine comprises a major component of our care of patients at the Carolina Center. We have found over the years that many patients benefit from the individualized use of nutrients, nutraceuticals, superfood concentrates, herbals, phytochemicals, and other specialized products such as glandulars and nutrient metabolites. With the help of nutritional and bio-energetic testing, we can help you select the best nutritional products for your money. We can then further fine-tune these recommendations over time so that you derive the optimum benefit from the products you are using. In addition, we may recommend Nutrition Education sessions to help deepen your understanding of the rationale for using nutritional and botanical aides, as well as to help you further refine your supplement regimen.
