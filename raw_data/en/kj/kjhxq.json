And this takes a toll on our health not only physically but also mentally. And when your mind and body are both sick, it will show on your face and your skin. To provide relief from all of these and posing as a single solution for all, an ancient technique called \"Aromatherapy\" is receiving the limelight. \"Healing begins with an aromatic bath and daily massage.\" - Hippocrates What is Aromatherapy? Aromatherapy makes use of natural essential oils which are aromatic in nature and are made up of natural ingredients which have therapeutic benefits. These fragrant essential oils can make one relax, alleviate stress and simultaneously cleanse the body in and out. How does it work? Aromatherapy is a coinage that came into the light only around the 1960s. But it finds its root in our ancient scriptures of Ayurveda. Even Egyptians and Romans performed this technique as medicinal treatments. Aromatherapy makes use of plants and their parts from which the fragrant essential oil is extracted. The fragrance or aroma is potent enough to stimulate the nerves in our body and lighten up the brain cells. It leads to the release of necessary hormones like endorphins which make you feel relaxed and energized. How to use essential oils? Modern aromatherapy primarily proceeds with the application of essential oils as massage or by inhalation only. Massage not only allows your skin to come in contact with all the wellness of the essential oil, but it also stimulates the release of toxins in your bloodstream, which later gets filtered out of your body. Inhalation of the fragrance, on the other hand, helps with nerve stimulation which, as explained earlier, can help you with leading a better life.
