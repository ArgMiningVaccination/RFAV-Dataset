We welcome all to share in the plant medicine of Kakaw (Cacao). About this Event About this Event Are you ready to check in with your innerG? We are offering the inner city the opportunity to clear energy, get grounded, realign with source, and the opportunity to connect deeper with ourselves and one another. Cacao ceremonies have been found to help the body to heal, detoxify and to give your immune system a good boost. The experience of raw chocolate within a cacao ceremony can also assist in energetic healing and gaining clarity in the areas of love, purpose, intuitive abilities, career and personal growth. "}
