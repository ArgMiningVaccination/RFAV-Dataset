The fuel you derive from glycogen, the carbohydrates stored in your body, is vital to your energy, endurance capacity, and post-workout recovery. The only problem is that most carbohydrate supplements are made with simple sugars and genetically modified ingredients. That's why at Swolverine, we created Clean Carbs\u00ae. What Is Clean Carbs? Clean Carbs is a carbohydrate supplement made with 100% complex carbohydrates from real superfoods, including sweet potatoes, yams, oats, and blueberries. It gives you a slow and steady energy release from real food, instead of refined sugars, for optimal workout recovery and performance. Most carbohydrate supplements are made with modified corn starch, which breaks down into sugar and spikes blood glucose and insulin levels, leading to increased weight gain and an energy crash. Why bother taking a carbohydrate supplement made with maltodextrin when you can get all that sugar from a candy bar? The Benefits of Complex Carbohydrates 1. Slower Digestion for Sustained Energy Complex carbs digest much more slowly than simple carbohydrates due to their longer chain molecular structure. Complex carbs are also sugars, but they do not spike blood insulin. They keep your blood glucose levels stable and provide a long-sustained energy release. These types of carbohydrates work best for: - Prolonging training - Improving endurance - Building more muscle mass - Optimizing body composition Complex carbs slow the absorption of sugar by slowing down digestion, which results in lower cholesterol levels and feeling full for a longer period of time. No blood sugar roller coaster with complex carbs! 2. Improved Body Composition Your body demands complex carbohydrates to build more muscle mass and burn body fat for optimal body composition. You won't get that effect if you constantly supplement with the simple sugars found in other carbohydrate supplements like maltodextrin, dextrose, waxy maize, or highly branched cylic dextrin. An optimal ratio of protein to carbohydrates is required to build more muscle mass and stack on more gains from your workout. 3. Better and Faster Recovery Clean Carbs is derived from real food, so it helps with faster recovery and reducing post-workout muscle soreness. Research indicates that your body rapidly burns through glycogen stores during high-intensity and endurance training. Replacing glycogen stores after strenuous exercise and training is vital for optimal performance and faster recovery Research also shows that fast-digesting carbs like dextrose do not help with recovery any more than real food.
