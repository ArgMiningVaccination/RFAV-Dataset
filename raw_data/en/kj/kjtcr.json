Unfortunately, 65% of those who survive an ischemic stroke suffer a significant motor disability. This results, in part, fr om a disruption of the connections between the brain and spinal cord that form motor pathways. The recovery of motor function depends on whether connections between the brain and spinal cord remain or reform [1,2]. In an animal model of ischemic stroke we have shown that spinal cord neurons in motor pathways change their structure and activity after a stroke. In as little as 7 days after a stroke, spinal cord neurons have fewer connections, are less active, and have dramatically altered excitatory signaling properties - meaning poorer control of movement. Altered neuronal signaling is prevalent even 28 days after the stroke, suggesting that changes in these critical brain- spinal cord pathways begins very soon after stroke and persist long- term. What we don't yet understand are the specific mechanisms that underlie the altered neuronal signaling in brain- spinal cord pathways after a stroke, or whether we can improve recovery by changing this signaling. In this project gene expression will be analysed to charac terise changes in ion channels that underlie altered neuronal signaling in brain and spinal cord motor pathways after stroke. Changes in neural signalling and ion channel function will be measured directly using electrophysiology techniques, and correlated with changes in motor function. An aerobic treadmill exercise intervention will be used to enhance brain- spinal cord pathways after stroke [3] and the mechanisms of this intervention on recovery of function will be explored. By the end of their candidature the student will be well -versed in small animal handling, behavior, surgical techniques, electrophysiology, sample and tissue preparation and collection, histology, rt -PCR and other laboratory techniques as needed, data collection, analysis, interpretat ion and write up.

Michelle.Rank@rmit.edu.au Associate supervisor: David Walker david.walker@rmit.edu.au Associate supervisor: Mary Defining in hypothalamic satiety Michelle Rank: Neurodevelopment and Disease Research Program Campus: Bundoora West PhD Project Project Description Microglia, one of the brain's major resident immune cell populations activate and proliferate when an individual consumes a high fat diet, but whether this response is primarily a driv er of or compensator against excess weight gain is currently unknown [1, 2, 3]. We have used a unique transgenic rat model allowing specific microglial ablation to show in lean animals that, when microglia are absent, feeding and weight gain are markedly suppressed. Unexpectedly, this reduced feeding drive is not due to changes in sat iety signaling at the level of the arcuate nucleus, a principal satiety -signaling brain region. Rather, the local arcuate nucleus circuitry is altered by microglial ablation to strongly increase the drive to eat. The signals that strongly over -ride this dr ive to eat are unknown. In this project we will examine, at a local circuit level using electrophysiology, how satiety signaling is modified in response to changes in microglia (i.e. their absence, repopulation, and activation) and determine what drivers are acting in these circuits to strongly over -ride the drive to eat initiated by ghrelin and (suppressed) leptin signaling. Properties of excitatory and inhibitory signaling will be characterised in populations of neurons within the arcuate nucleus circuit ry. This research will identify how hypothalamic satiety signaling, at the individual neuron and neural circuit level, is modified by changes in the activity of the brain's immune cells, identifying potential targets for the control of feeding and weight gain in the clinic.

Sarah.Spencer@rmit.edu.au Can Creatine Minimize the Impact of Sleep Apnoea on the Brain? Neurodevelopment and Disease Research Program C ampus Bundoora West PhD Project Project Description Many adults suffer from apnoea during sleep; they repeatedly stop breathing for periods of 10 -100 seconds. The immediate result of this is that the supply of oxygen to the brain is decreased, and levels of carbon dioxide in the brain and in blood increase, sometimes to dangerous levels that alter cellular metabolism. Another immediate consequence of this is that sleep is disrupted, and the person often wakes from a night's sleep feeling unrefreshed and in a low mood. A longer -term consequence of sleep apnoea is that it slowly causes damage to the brain, and may enhance other processes that result in cognitive decline and age- related dementia. Creatine is an intracellular metabolite that is involved in the regeneration of ATP, and an essential intermediate in energy cycling in all cells. Intracellular creatine in the brain can be increased by adding creatine to the diet, and increased dietary intake has the effect of supporting cellular energy turnover even in situations when oxygen levels are depleted. Ingestion of high levels of creatine is known to be safe; indeed, many athletes do this to increase their physical performance. In this project we will test the hypothesis that increased creatine intake in people subject to sleep apnoea will have the effect of minimizing the metabolic effects of the cessation of breathing, decrease the number and length of apneic episodes, and improve sleep quality. This project will require us to recruit volunteers with untreated sleep apnoea who are willing to have their sleep monitored for one night, and for them to ingest a test compound of creatine or placebo, for up to 1 week before another session of sleep monitoring. We will measure mood, subjective sleepiness and cogni tion at the start of the experiment and again at the end. Physiological measures will include EEG, heart rate, blood pressure and arterial blood oxygenation.

These include a significant increase in body weight and fat mass, necessary to sustain a developing foetus. However, these changes are also likely to lead to changes in the maternal metabolic and brain functions that will last beyond pregnancy and lactation 1. Importantly, western diets are known for their deficiency in omega -3 fatty acids, and excessive amounts of omega- 6 fatty acids. Excessive amounts of omega- 6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) and a very high omega- 6/omega -3 ratio promote the pathogenesis of many diseases 2,3 , including antenatal anxiety4 and an increase in depressive symptoms during pregnancy5. We hypothesise that pregnancy permanently changes the maternal brain feeding circuitry, allowing adaption to the high- energy demand conditions, while exposure to unbalanced diet high in omega- 6 fatty acids and high omega -6/omega- 3 ratio during the periconception and peripartum windows may disrupt this essential maternal brain plasticity and will also lead to resistance in the brain reward pathways, subsequently influencing maternal care. We also hypothesise that by restoring the omega- 6/omega -3 ratio during pregnancy and lactation, we will be able to reverse the detrimental effects of preconception unbalanced diet. We will examine weight gain, fat mass, brain and peripheral satiety signaling, and brain reward pathways in rats fed diet high in omega- 6/omega -3 ratio during preconception, pregnancy and lactation. By altering the diet composition during pregnancy and lactation to achieve balanced supply of fatty acids, we will normalise maternal metabolic and brain function. This project will lead to a better understanding of the impact of diet during and before pregnancy on the maternal brain. By the end of their candidature the student will be well -versed in small animal handling, behaviour, surgical, sample and tissue collection techniques, immunohistochemistry, rt -PCR and other laboratory techniques as needed, data collection, analysis, inter pretation and write up.

Neuroendocrinology of the Obese Brain Research Group within the Neurodevelopment and Disease Research Program Campus: Bundoora West PhD Project Project Description Pregnancy leads to a great increase in maternal weight. Increased food intake during pregnancy is essential in order to sustain a developing foetus. Excessive weight gain during the preconception window, however, produces lasting effects on foetal developm ent, leading to a range of physiological and behavioural abnormalities in the offspring 1,2. Importantly, ba lanced supply of fatty acids during pregnancy is necessary for optimal brain development and subsequent long- term behavioural outcomes, while western diets are known for their unbalanced composition and content of fatty acids, with a high omega- 6/omega -3 fatty acids ratio being particularly detrimental for foetal brain and behavioural development 3,4. However, the mechanisms of this disruption of neurodevelopmental processes and whether these can be revers ed by balanced diet have not been fully investigated. We hypothesise that maternal diet high in omega -6/omega -3 ratio during the periconception and peripartum windows will have long -term consequences on neurodevelopmental milestones in the offspring. We also hypothesise that by restoring the fatty acids ratio during pregnancy and lactation, we will be able to reverse the detrimental effects of preconception unbalanced diet on the offspring development. We will examine maternal weight and body fat during pregnancy and lactation, as well as neonatal weight gain. We will also assess the impact of diet on the establishment of neural circuitry underlying the control of cognitive function and appetite. By altering dietary composition during peripartum to achieve balanced supply of fatty acids, we aim to restore neurobehavioural function in the offspring. This project will lead to a better understanding of the impact of dietary fatty acids during and before pregnancy and lactation on foetal and neonatal development.

Stress management has significant potential to improve reproductive success rates, but it is essential that we begin to identify why fertility is markedly affected by stress in some individuals, and not in others. Our novel data in rats and mice show that the gut hormone ghrelin regulates stress and mood disorders, plays a crucial role in reproduction, and that chronic stress negatively impacts upon fertility by stimulating a dysregulation in ghrelin signalling 2,3. Therefore, we propose ghrelin as a novel link between stress and infertility and a target for reducing the effects of stress on all aspects of reproduction. In this project, we will characterise the effects of chronic stress on the ghrelin system and examine whether by restoring the balance between the different circulating forms of ghrelin we can reverse the effects of social stress and restore normal reproductive function. Specifically, we will determine the potential for restoring ghrelin signalling to reverse the detrimental effects of chronic st ress in a female mouse model and develop an oocyte developmental index based on global gene expression patterns during development into maturation. This will allow us to predict future functionality in the models of reproductive adversity. We will assess t he effects of prolonged stress on the ovarian reserve, oocyte quality, reproductive and ghrelin hormonal profile, breeding capacity and pregnancy outcomes, and whether the effects of stress are reversed by normalising the levels of ghrelin. We will also us e whole transcriptome profiling of mouse oocytes across development to generate a developmental gene expression of thousands of genes, and assess oocyte maturity and quality by in vitro maturation of adult oocytes from stressed and non -stressed mice. The c ombination of the gene profiling developmental index and oocyte function will allow us to establish the biological age of an individual's oocytes and assay the impact of stress on the oocyte age. By the end of their candidature the student will be well-versed in small animal handling, behaviour, surgical, sample and tissue collection techniques, immunohistochemistry, rt -PCR and other laboratory techniques as needed, data collection, analysis, interpretation and write up.

Neurodevelopment and Disease Research Program Campus: Bundoora West PhD Project Project Description Preterm birth (PTB), defined as birth before 37 completed weeks gestation, is the leading cause of perinatal morbidity and mortality [1]. Preterm birth often occurs in the second half of gestation during a period of rapid brain growth and maturation, thus premature delivery exposes the baby to an excitatory extra- uterine environment before many of the brain's circuits are formed and refined; this is implicated in changing th e preterm brain's connectivity, leading to long -term neurological deficits [2]. Some of the most prevalent disorders seen in children born prematurely are emotional disorders including anxiety and depression. The amygdala is a key region of the brain in regulating fear and emotional output. Its connection to the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex make this region important in the formation of emotional memories and responses [3]. Many studies involving the amygdala focus on its size in relation to emotional, behavioural and cognitive outcomes [4]. However, little information is available on how preterm birth changes the long-term connectivity to higher order structures such as the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex, and how these relate to the increased preval ence of emotional disorders among ex -preterm children. The aim of this project is to assess the changes in connectivity within the brain between the amygdala, hippocampus and prefrontal cortex and to determine how these relate to the severity of emotional disorders in term and preterm infants and adolescents. This project will use neonatal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans collected from the Victorian Infant Brain Study (VIBeS) [5] to assess connectivity changes between the amygdala, hippocampus and prefrontal cortex at term equivalent age, and 7 years of age. This assessment will be correlated with the severity of emotional and behavioural outcomes as assessed at 2, 5 and 7 years of age. Controls will be data collected from babies and children born at term, without any behavioural and emotional disorders. Currently there is little information available as to how preterm birth impacts the brain's ability to develop from childhood to adolescence and how this impacts their emotionality later in life. The VIBeS cohort is one of the world's largest prospective longitudinal neuroimaging and neurodevelopmental studies and provides the opportunity to study the long -term changes within the brains of individuals from infancy through to pre- teenage years. Anxiety and depression are leading causes for loss -of-productivity and days off work, and impact the social and professional lives of people who live with these disorders. The data from this study will therefore direct research in adult anxiety and depression disorders and will lead to research into new or more personalized treatments. By the end of their candidature students will have expertise in MRI and tractography analysis, behavioural and emotional questionnaires, data interpretation, statistical analysis and scientific writing.

Cheong, pregnancy to improve fetal growth and neonatal outcomes following fetal growth restriction. Neurodevelopment and Disease Research Program Campus Bundoora West PhD Project Project Description Fetal Growth Restriction (FGR) is defined as the failure of a fetus to reach its genetic growth potential, and together with prematurity is a leading cause of perinatal morbidity, and even death. FGR is a significant health issue worldwide, affecting 5- 10% pregnancies, which equates to ~30 million newborns worldwide, per annum. FGR is associated with a 3- 4 fold increased risk of stillbirth, and FGR babies that survive hav e a 10 to 30 -fold increased risk of developing cerebral palsy. FGR is commonly caused by poor placental function, which leads to chronic fetal hypoxemia and reduced fetal supply of glucose and other essential nutrients, ultimately impacting on the ability of the fetus to grow, and for essential organs including the brain to develop and mature properly. The fetal brain is relatively less affected in size compared to the body as a whole (i.e. brain 'sparing'); nevertheless, the brain is affected internally, and surviving FGR infants have a greatly heightened risk of presenting with neurodevelopmental impairment s. There are no treatments that improve placental insufficiency, and halt, slow, or correct FGR. Creatine is an amino- acid derivative obtained from the diet, and also by endogenous synthesis from the amino acids arginine, glycine and methionine. Our recent studies show that creatine added to the diet of pregnant animals enhances mitochondrial function in fetal tissues challenged by hypoxic -ischemic condit ions. They also show that creatine- fed mothers have offspring more likely to survive birth asphyxia, and also that prenatal creatine loading is protective for many fetal organs - diaphragm muscle, axial skeletal muscles, kidneys - as well as the brain. We will now test the hypothesis that a prenatal diet rich in creatine can improve fetal growth in the presence of poor placental function. In a validated animal model of FGR in pregnant guinea pigs, we will determine: (i) the effects of induced placental ins ufficiency on placental and fetal creatine status; (ii) the effects of maternal creatine supplementation on late gestation fetal growth and placental function; (iii) brain structure at birth and at an adolescent equivalent age; and (iv) neurobehavioural ou tcomes in the offspring.

FGR is defined as the failure of the fetus to reach its genetic growth potential and can occur when there is an inadequate supply of oxygen and nutrients to the fetus because of poor placental function. Surviving growth- restricted babies can have abnormal brain development [2] and an increased risk of learning difficulties, intellectual and cognitive deficits, motor deficits, cerebr al palsy and autism [3]. We have identified a novel thyroid hormone analogue that can potentially repair brain injury and reduce the morbidity associated with FGR. The aim of this project is to determine whether antenatal treatment with a novel thyroid hormone analogue will repair brain injury, and improve long -term neurobehavioural dysfunction following FGR. This project will use a guinea pig model of FGR where we ligate the uterine artery at mid- pregnancy to restrict blood flow and nutrient supply to fet uses [4]. Controls are generated from pregnancies where the uterine artery is not ligated. We will then treat dams (ligated and non- ligated) with either vehicle or the thyroid hormone analogue. The fetal brains will then be collected and assessed using his tological, immunohistochemical and molecular techniques. Separate cohorts of offspring (control, FGR, treated, un - treated) will be grown to adolescence and assessed using a suite of neurobehavioral tests. With no antenatal treatment for brain injury in FG R, our challenge is to develop safe and effective therapies. This study will test the therapeutic potential of a novel thyroid hormone analogue in an animal model of FGR and will provide some essential information required for this compound to progress to clinical testing .

Our in vitro studies show that scymnol is a substrate for steroid- metabolising enzymes [2], reducing accumulation of active androgens in rat liver microsomes during metabolism of exogenous testosterone. Scymnol also has other relevant bioactivities, including being a potent antioxidant and liver -protective agent [3]. Overall, its bioactivities provide a mechanistic basis for investigating scymnol's potential as a novel therapeutic agent for treating androgen -excess disorders. Androgen -excess disorders range from skin problems (acne, hirsutism and alopecia) to prostate cancer - these are caused by an overproduction of active androgens during local testosterone metabolism [4]. This project aims to investigate the androgen -modifying effects of scymnol in androgen -sensitiv e and normal cells and tissues, both in vitro and in vivo , via pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic mechanisms. Initial studies will use in vitro cell lines, to identify the effects of scymnol on androgenic activity, through the use of proliferation and scr eening assays. Further studies will investigate the mode of action of scymnol and the particular downstream signalling pathways involved, using gene expression and protein quantification methods. Later in the project, in vivo test systems will use animal e thics-approved models, whereby control subjects will be compared to subjects with elevated androgen levels (via injection of testosterone) after exposure to scymnol. The project will be undertaken in the Natural Products Research and Nanosafety/Toxicology Research laboratories. Scymnol research at RMIT involves the industry partner MacLab Pty. Ltd, with the supply of synthetic scymnol provided by the Natural Products Research laboratories at RMIT. This project will produce a high- quality multidisciplinary PhD graduate with industry -related research capabilities. The graduate will gain specialised expertise and advanced laboratory skills in cell culture, microscopy and molecular biology, biochemistry, toxicology and animal handling, which are in high demand in the pharmaceutical and biomedical industries. Results from this project will be published in high impact scientific journals, and presented at national or international conferences. References: [1]. al. Steroids 76 (2010) 163. [3]. L.D.

We have made an important recent discovery that a G - coupled protein receptor (GPCR) called formyl peptide receptor 2 (FPR2) and its ligands including Serum Amyloid A (SAA) and soluble uPAR ar e over -expressed in lung cancer biopsies. The FPR2 receptor plays a critical role in the transition from acute inflammation to resolution by binding to distinct ligands. SAA and soluble uPAR are considered inflammatory agonists that promote leukocyte recruitment and survival; whereas endogenous molecules known as specialized pro- resolving mediators (SPMs) switch off inflammation by blocking leukocyte migration and survival. SPMs that bind to FPR2 include Lipoxin A 4 and Resolvin D 1, which are generated from the essential omega fatty acids. Our laboratory has been at the forefront in defining the role of FPR2 in chronic inflammatory lung diseases and we have shown that there is an imbalance in FPR2 ligands (i.e. too much inflammatory ligands relative to SPMs) that drives persistent mucosal inflammation in chronic lung diseases [1, 2]. In this project, you will utilize a novel knock -in mouse lung cancer model that develops a more aggressive form of lung cancer due to excessive inflammation [3]. We have generated preliminary data demonstrating that FPR2 and its ligands; SAA and soluble uPAR are over -expressed in the lungs of this unique knock -in lung cancer model. Specifically, you will develop a therapeutic strategy to deliver SPMs including Lipoxin A 4 and Resolvin D 1 and evaluate their ability to prevent the progression of lung tumours. In addition, FPR2 is expressed on cytotoxic natural killer (NK) cells [4]. Cytotoxic NK cells play a critical role in preventing progression of cancer as they can normall y recognize and kill cancer cells through the release of molecules including granzyme B and perforins. Cancer cells can avoid being recognized and attacked by cytotoxic cells by expressing immunosuppressive molecules. In this project, you will also evaluat e FPR2 expression and ligand responses in NK cell lines in order to determine how this influences recognition and cytolytic function of cancer cells. You will also measure inhibitory and activating NK cell receptors that dictate the activation status of NK cells. Importantly, you will also validate key findings using cryopreserved peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from lung cancer patients. A suite of molecular, immunological and histological tools will be used including immunohistochemistry, RT- qPCR and flow cytometry. References: [1]. S. al. 109 (2012) [2]. S. Bozinovski et al .

Despite improvement in morbidity and mortality following treatment wit h combination antiretroviral therapy (cART), currently available treatments do not cure HIV and treatment is life- long. Additionally, while there has been a decrease in the severity of HIV -1 associated neurological disorders (HAND) they remain among the most common neurological disorders in people under the age of 40, and the prevalence of HAND, including its most severe form as HIV -associated dementia (HAD), continues to increase in Australia and the USA despite the introduction of cART(1). HIV -1 infection of the central nervous system (CNS) and the pathogenic mechanisms involved in HAND are poorly understood. This is largely due to the limited availability of clinically and neurologically well -characterised HAND tissue samples, and the lack of availability of sensitive techniques to allow the study of physiologically relevant, CNS -derived HIV -1 strains. Understanding the pathogenesis of HAND and development of targeted therapy directed at the CNS has become an important health care issue to address. The maj or goal of research towards a cure for HIV is to identify strategies that will lead to either a sterilising cure (elimination of all infected cells) or a functional cure (long -term control of HIV in the absence of cART). The principal reason why cART cannot cure HIV is persistence of HIV in resting memory T- cells, and other long-lived cells such as brain astrocytes and cells of the macrophage lineage (2 -4). Understanding how HIV infects and persists in cells of the CNS is critical for development of strateg ies to achieve a cure for HIV. In this project, we will utilise a unique bank of autopsy brain and matched CSF, plasma and PBMC samples from a cohort of individuals who died with the presence or absence of HAD and HIV -1 encephalitis (HIVE), whilst receivin g- or not receiving cART with the aim of elucidating the role of the HIV -1 Env glycoproteins in mediating HIV -1 neurotropism and establishment of viral reservoirs. Highly specific and innovative immuno- histochemical techniques RNA/DNAscope technology will be used to identify infected cells in brain tissues; laser capture microdissection to isolate individual infected cells; and highly specific/sensitive PCR techniques to clone the HIV genomes detected. HIV -1 envelopes will be analysed for co- receptor use a nd virus for replication capacity using well established assays using affinofile receptor assays. References: 1. R. K.

HIV-1 cannot be eradicated by combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) alone. The major obstacle to eradicating HIV -1 is the ability of proviral DNA to persist latently in cellular reservoirs (1). Consequently, the delineation of the mechanisms of persistence in latently infected cells and how latency can be reversed to render the cells susceptible to antiviral therapies and immune surveillance, is a high priority area for HIV -1 research. The central nervous system (CNS) reservoir poses unique and important challenges to HIV -1 eradication, which are poorly understood. This pr oject will directly address these challenges to better inform cure strategies for a more comprehensive approach to eradicating HIV -1 from all tissue reservoirs in the body. Specific challenges to HIV -1 cure imposed by the CNS include; the brain is an immunologically privileged compartment, refractory to adequate penetration by many drugs used in cART; its resident cells have unique transcriptional regulatory mechanisms; and thus it follows that the evolution of HIV -1 in the brain will select for unique vari ants whose transcriptional regulatory mechanisms are distinct from those which govern viral persistence in T cells. These differences will directly influence the ability of transcriptional activating drugs, including those currently in phase II clinical HI V-1 cure trials, to successfully reactivate and eliminate latent virus. Thus, it is essential to the overall goal of HIV -1 eradication that there is a complete understanding the transcriptional regulatory mechanisms of HIV -1 in latently infected cells of t he CNS. We have shown that a significant proportion of astrocytes and macrophage -lineage cells in the CNS are latently infected with HIV -1 (2,3,4). Since these latently infected cells are long- lived and brain macrophages having the potential to be activated to produce HIV -1 capable of seeding virus to peripheral organs, they are central to Cure strategies. Specifically, this project will determine the regulatory mechanisms underlying the effects of latency reversing agents (LRAs) on cellular reservoirs within the CNS. In this project, we will utilise a unique bank of autopsy brain and matched CSF, plasma and PBMC samples from a cohort of individuals who died whilst virally suppressed and receiving cART with the aim of determining the factors involved in transcriptional regulation in persistently in infected cells in the CNS. We will utilise DNA/RNAscope technology and laser capture microdissection to isolate transcriptional assay to determine chromatin assays to determine factors regulating latency. References: 1. M. J.

Shortly after infection, HIV enters the central nervous system (CNS) where it can remain persistent throughout the course of disease and causes HIV -associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND) in up to 50% of infected individuals. These disorders, which range from asymptomatic neurological impairment (ANI) to mild neurological impairment (MND) and the most severe form: HIV -associated dementia (HAD), can cause memory loss, a reduced ability to live and function independently, and relationship breakdowns. Currently, the gold standard method for diagnosing HAND, and thus determining whether a patient should be treated with anti -HIV drugs that target the CNS, is a neuropsychological and neurological examination followed by imaging and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) testing. Unfortunately, because (i) neuropsychological and neurological examinations are relatively subjective and do not consistently cross language and cultural barriers, and (ii) CSF HIV testing requires a lumbar puncture; a highly invasive procedure for which patients' consent is notoriously difficul t to obtain, there is currently an unmet clinical demand for a relatively non-invasive, objective and reliable diagnostic test for HAND. In response, here we aim to develop \"HAND - iT\": the first computer program to diagnose HAND based on the presence of mut ations within HIV genetic sequences isolated from patients' blood samples. For this project, students will isolate HIV genetic sequences from a panel of HAND and non -HAND patient - derived peripheral blood mononuclear cells, autopsy brain tissue and CSF samples. These sequences will then be taken into the \"dry lab\" where students will learn, utilise and develop bioinformatics techniques to create HAND- iT, test the programs accuracy and then translate it to an online website accessible to researchers and cli nicians.

Despite successful viral suppression with cART, HIV -associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND) rem ain a significant clinical problem with HAND diagnosed in 30- 69% of treated subjects. These syndromes, which include mild neurocognitive disorders (MND) and asymptomatic neurocognitive impairment (ANI), are a significant health, economic and social problem in Australia and worldwide. The pathophysiology of MND and ANI is poorly understood, principally because of (i) the paucity of clinical brain tissue samples available from HIV -infected, cART -treated subjects, (ii) the inability to sequentially sample such tissues in humans, and (iii) the highly specialised nature of experimentation required on rare tissues that are available. However, we now know that subjects diagnosed with ANI have a significantly greater risk of progressing to MND and exhibit a shorter time to presentation of symptoms compared to subjects without ANI. Understanding the pathophysiology of HAND, in particular ANI, will better inform treatment options for patients to significantly improve the quality of their life. The challenge is the inability to conduct sequential sampling studies of human brain tissues for immunological and virological analyses. Non- human primate (NHP) studies provide a unique and powerful research tool to overcome these challenges. Elucidating the pathophysiology of dif ferent forms of HAND will only be achieved by in depth, sequential analyses of tissues from clinically well characterised simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) -infected NHPs, juxtaposed to cross analyses of autopsy tissues from cART -treated, clinic ally/neurologically well characterised humans who died with HIV infection. Highly sophisticated and innovative techniques will be used, such as laser capture microdissection (LCM) and RNA/DNAscope for highly sensitive single- cell analyses of infected cells within the brain. Single- cell analysis is essential for elucidating the cell -specific mechanisms involved in the pathophysiology of HAND. This project will identify the temporal nature and immunological and inflammatory sequelae of SIV infection in the br ain, the impact of cART on these events, and the clinical parallels to development of types of HAND in humans that are relevant in cART -treated patients.

There is a critical gap in our understanding of C -HIV pathogenesis, particularly for the formation of viral reservoirs, which establish early and hinder eradication. This project will determine whether adaptive changes in clade C HIV -1 (C-HIV) envelope glycoproteins (Env) during disease progression affect infection of cells known to be viral reservoirs. We hypothesise that interactions between Env and cellular receptors early in infection will be enhanced, providing an increased ability to infect key immune cells encouraging viral dissemination and infection of viral reservoirs. Env largely determines cellular tropism [1, 2] and thus has the ability to influence the size and longev ity of the viral reservoir [3]. However, which viral reservoirs, in particular CD4 + T cell subsets, are preferentially infected early in C -HIV and how this changes during disease progression remains unclear. Using a unique C -HIV natural infection cohort, we will determine viral tropism for CD4+ T cell subsets and macrophages from early to chronic disease stages. Longitudinally we will characterize HIV-1 receptor usage and dependence, cellular tropism, presence of broadly neutralizing antibodies [4] and cha nges in Env, to determine how Env influences viral reservoir development. New insight into the evolution of C -HIV Env and infection of viral reservoirs will be key for the development of novel therapies for the eradication of HIV. A range of molecular and immunological techniques will be used and research findings will be presented at conferences and for publication.

Understanding how HIV -1 is able to spread infection between immune cells, is key for the development of vaccines and preventative therapies. This project will determine whether viruses from different disease stages are more readily transferred by cell-cell contact and assist to unravel the pathways through which this key event occurs. We hypothesise that cell -cell transmission is an important event during early events in HIV -1 dissemination and that early disease stage viruses are more readily transmitted than chronic stage viruses allowing for greater viral dissemination early in infection. Macrophages and CD4+ T cells are important immune cells for HIV -1 pathogenesis [2, 3] and both contribute to the viral reservoir [2, 4]. Macrophages also facilitate HIV -1 dissemination by recruiting CD4+ T cells to the site of infection and more recent ly through cell -cell transfer of HIV [1]. However, it is not conclusive whether cell -cell transfer of HIV -1 to macrophages is solely through phagocytosis of infected CD4+ T cells or through a different mechanism. A panel of macrophage and T cell tropic vi ruses will be used to investigate the role of macrophages in the dissemination of HIV -1. We will examine the frequency and efficiency of direct cell infection compared to cell-cell transmission and the mechanism of cell -cell transfer. We will study the inf luence of the type of macrophage and CD4+ T cell on the ability of cell -cell transfer and whether disease stage plays a role in in the route of HIV -1 cellular transmission. Students will utilize a range of molecular and immunological techniques including flow cytometry, fluorescent microscopy, viral assays and cell culture.

Chronic, Infectious and Inflammatory Diseases Program (Lung Regeneration Group) Campus: Bundoora West PhD Project Project Description This project will involve characterizing the cellular and molecular mechanisms involved in lung regeneration after influenza and/or bacterial infection. It is assumed that aberrant repair is central to the pathogenesis of diseases like idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), yet we still know very little about the progenitor cells that regenerate damaged airways and gas -exchange surfaces of the lung, or how changes in the local microenvironment regulate their behavior during critical stages of repair or pathol ogical remodeling. One of the hallmark characteristics of IPF pathology is the bronchiolization (or honeycombing) of the alveolar space, which refers to the increased presence of basal stem cells that do not normally reside in the alveoli. This abnormal epithelial remodelling is often juxtaposed to regions of dense fibrosis. Similarly, after influenza infection in mice, basal cells expand to repopulate the depleted alveolar epithelium. What is not known is whether the changes in the stem cell pool and the local microenvironment are concomitant defects or have a cause and effect relationship. Interestingly, recent preliminary data suggests that this wound- healing process is altered in the context of influenza and bacterial co- infection. This project will explore the relationship between the mesenchymal cell composition of the injured microenvironment and epithelial remodelling; and examine how this process of tissue regeneration is altered in the context of bacterial co -infection. The aim of this project w ill be to use mouse models of influenza and/or bacterial infection in combination with novel three- dimensional in vitro organoid cultures to elucidate the inter -cellular communication involved in tissue regeneration. After influenza and/bacterial infection, immunohistochemistry of lung tissue sections will be used to characterise changes in tissue regeneration. Cellular changes over the course of the injury - repair process will be investigated by flow cytometry, immunohistochemistry and gene expression analy ses. References: [1]. -1233. [2]. J.L.

Campus: Bundoora West PhD Project Project Description These projects aim to identify novel mechanisms of viral replication that underlie some of the most devastating diseases worldwide. The ever -present threat of epidemics and pandemics, emerging anti -viral resistance, and long lag times for vaccine development highlight an urgent and ongoing need for novel therapeutic approaches that target viral pathology, ideally in a manner that is independent of the infecting strain. We have identified a novel biological mechanism that is viral strain -independent, which provides a target for therapeutic intervention in influenza [1,2]. We focus on the important family of enzymes, the NADPH oxidases (NOXs) - the \"master\" generators of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in mammalian cells [3]. ROS are a crucial component of the i mmune response to invading pathogens, but paradoxically, ROS promote virus replication by unknown mechanisms. We show for the first time that endosomes are the major subcellular site of ROS production in response to influenza virus [2]. In addition, virus -dependent endosomal ROS responses suppresses anti -viral immunity and therefore have major implications for the treatment of viral disease. We provide proof -of-concept that this mechanism can be exploited via a prototype endosome -targeted inhibitor of ROS that dramatically promotes viral clearance and reduces virus pathogenicity in vivo (see figure). Hypothesis Inhibition of endosomal NOX2 oxidase activity enhances virus elimination, reduces disease severity and provides a novel and highly effective a pproach for anti -viral treatment. Project 1: To determine whether targeting endosomal NOX2 oxidase suppresses pathogenicity to influenza A virus infection in vivo . Project 2: To establish the effectiveness of NOX2 oxidase inhibitors as vaccine adjuvants t o bolster antibody production during influenza virus infections. Techniques to be employed The PhD student will perform in vivo studies , in particular with mice, and in vitro studies involving influenza virus infections. The project will also involve the treatment and dissection of laboratory animals, various scientific analyses including cellular, protein and mRNA assays, confocal immunofluorescence microscopy and carry out elementary statistical analysis on scientific data.

Vlahos et al., oxidant- dependent pathways to treat skeletal muscle wasting in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease Respiratory Research Group Program in Chronic Infectious and Inflammatory Diseases Campus: Bundoora West PhD Project Project Description Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a major incurable global health burden and is currently the 4th largest cause of death in the world [1] . COPD costs the Australian community over $8.8 billion per year and causes substantial morbidity and mortality [2]. Patients with COPD often suffer from severe muscle wasting, which increases their risk of death and reduces quality of life [3, 4] . Preventing or reversing wasting offers a major advance in COPD treatment, increasing quality of life and survival. Common clinical strategies to improve muscle mass and function in COPD patient s include anabolic hormones, nutritional intervention and exercise training; unfortunately these treatments often have limited clinical success and currently there are no effective treatments for muscle wasting [3, 4] . Our research aims to develop new therapeutic approaches to reverse or prevent muscle wasting. Elevated oxidative stress is emerging as an important factor in the pathology of COPD, and can be caused both by oxidants within cigarette smoke and by reactive oxygen species (ROS) released by inflammatory cells within the lungs. Although studies have shown that there is ox idative damage in various tissues of COPD patients, currently very little is known about the effects of oxidative stress in muscle of COPD patients or the potential effects of antioxidants in reducing muscle wasting by reducing the respiratory and systemic oxidative burden. The aim of this project is to elucidate the mechanisms underlying cigarette smoke -induced skeletal muscle wasting and dysfunction in COPD and provide proof -of-concept that: (i) targeted inhibition of ROS generating enzymes (Nox2 inhibit ors); and/or (ii) use of selective ROS scavengers (Gpx mimetics) can be utilized as a therapeutic approach to (A) reduce skeletal muscle wasting and (B) improve skeletal muscle function in COPD. The student will learn a number of skills including in vivo disease models, quantitative PCR, cell culture of mouse and human muscle cells, microscopy, histology, ELISA and Western blotting.

Cigarette smoking is the major cause of COPD and accounts for more than 95% of cases in industrialized countries [1] . COPD costs the Australian community over $8.8 billion per year and causes substantial morbidity and mortality [2] . Importantly, much of the disease burden and health care utilisation in COPD is associated with the management of its comorbidities and viral and bacterial -induced acute exacerbations of COPD (AECOPD) [1]. Recent clinical studies have shown that cognitive dysfunction is present in up to 60% of COPD patients, with impairment in memory, attention and executive function [3-5]. In addition, comorbid cognitive dysfunction impacts on important outcomes such as quality of life, hospitalisation and survival [3-5]. The high prevalence of cognitive dysfunction in COPD may also help explain the insufficient adherence to therapeutic plans and strategies, thus exacerbating and increasing the social costs in COPD subjects. However, the mechanisms underlying brain pathology and cognitive impairment in COPD are largely unknown. The aim of this project is to determine the mechanisms underlying cigarette smoke -induced cognitive dysfunction in COPD in an effort to develop therapies to prevent or slow down cognitive dysfunction caused by cigarette smoking. The student will learn a number of skills including in vivo disease models, histology, morphometry, quantitative PCR, FACS analysis of cell populations, cell and tissue culture, microscopy, ELISA, zymography and Western blotting References: 1.

The loss of muscular strength and physical function [1, 2] associated with sarcopenia increases the risk of mortality, morbidity and disability [3, 4]. Hence it is critical to identify the onset of sarcopenia in order to reduce or minimise the associated risks. Current techniques used to assess muscular mass, str ength and physical function are costly, labour intensive and usually involve radiation [5]. The tests cannot be used in populations with comorbidities that limit movement or that are unable to follow test instructions (e.g. cognitive impairment) [5]. Moreover, the tests commonly used to assess physical function heighten the risk of injury. As an alternative, brightness mode ultrasound has the potential to provide a safe and effective assessment through the measurement of muscle architecture (i.e. muscle thickness, pennation angle and fascicle length). This technique is non- invasive, reliable and presents no injury risk to participants [6]. Research demonstrates that muscle architecture measures are significantly related to muscle strength [7]. However, there is a need for large -scale studies to fully understand the links between muscle architecture, strength, function and mass. The primary aim of this investigation is to determine the utility of ultrasonography to identify the onset of sarcopenia. References: [1] Doherty Invited 2003;95:1717 -27.

Com munity Health and Research Group (CHaRG) Campus: Bundoora West PhD Project Project Description Regular exercise through walking enhances physical health and mental well -being. Positive outcomes include weight management, blood pressure reduction, lower risk of significant disease (cardiovascular, cancer) and reductions in depression and anxiety [1, 2] . It has been shown that there is a gait speed- survival relationship associated with aging. In a study involving 34,485 older adults ( 78.5 \u00b1 5.9 years), it was found that a gait speed of 0.8 m/s was associated with median life expectancy, whereas a speed faster than 1.0m/s suggested better than average life expectancy and above 1.2 m/s suggested exceptional life expectancy [3]. Other changes associated with aging involve reductions in joint motion (e.g. hip extension), foot - ground/obstacle clearance and ankle plantar -flexor power [4] . Ankle by the Triceps Surae muscul ature and is critical for propelling the body forward and for quickly recovering balance after a stumble or trip [5]. It has also been shown through muscle- driven simulations of human walking that gait is most sensitive to weakness of the ankle plantar -flexors, hip abductors, and hip flexors [6]. Hence it is important to maintain or i mprove the function, strength and power (concentric and eccentric) of these muscles, especially in an aging population. The aim of this project is to assess whether exercise programs that target the strength and power (eccentric and concentric) specific targeted muscles can improve gait and dynamic balance in older adults. It is hypothesized that improvements in the power and strength will improve these outcomes. References [1] Eyler AA, Brownson RC, Bacak SJ, Housemann R.

It is well known that regular exercise improves physiological and psychological outcomes such cardiorespiratory function and general well -being (2, 3). Aerobic exercise can be described as a form of dynamic meditation since it is repetitive in nature and requires concentration to maintain exercise intensity ( 4). This suggests that long- term aerobic training may lead to neurophysiological adaptations similar to those achieved through meditation. The high intensity workloads of many workers often leads to negative stress resulting in fatigue, illness and a loss of work productivity (2, 3, 5). Moreover, many workers' tasks are sedentary in nature, which increases the risk of the development of chronic physical conditions such as coronary heart disease. Few studies have investigated the effects of meditative practices in conju nction with aerobic exercise (or exercise alone) on neurophysiological outcomes such as cognitive function (6) and brain volume (7) in the workplace. No research has directly compared the outcomes of meditative practices and aerobic exercise on measures of neurophysiological function, general health and wellbeing in the workplace. This research investigates whether w orkplace interventions that utilise meditation and exercise programs (in combination or alone) improve health, wellbeing and productivity, and reduce health care costs. Specifically, measures of neurophysiological, physiological and psychological function will be investigated. References: [1] Ricard M et al.. Mind of the meditator.

Generally, the health care professional instructs the patient with directions to follow with little allowance for exchange of information. While that can and may work for some patients, it fails to optimize outcomes in the majority of cases. Health coaching focuses on motivation, engagement, and increasing the self -confidence of patients. The implementation of allied health professional based health coaching programs ha s the potential to improve patient outcomes. Health coaching is not currently included in the curriculum of allied health students e.g. pharmacy students. Service learning i.e. meaningful community service to enrich the learning experience is also infreq uently performed by Australian undergraduates. In this proposal the PhD student will develop a \"health coach\" training program which will be incorporated into the undergraduate program of an allied health profession. The impact of the training program on students' skills and on health aspects of patient groups in a service learning arrangement will be evaluated. Human ethics approvals will be required.

In addition to offering legal and physical protection, a key goal of resettlement is to facilitate integration and ensure the health and well -being of resettled refugees in the longer term. Much f ocus has been on the mental health of refugees, little is known about health around conditions such as diabetes and respiratory and cardiovascular diseases. Pharmacists have a key role in promoting self -care in the community, however their knowledge around strategies for refugees is poor. In this project a number of stages are proposed. The project has potential to be upgraded to a PhD. Stage 1 - literature review of what is known about self -care amongst refugees. Stage 2 - qualitative interviews amongst re fugees of a specific ethnic background and pharmacists to develop an understanding of barriers and enablers of self -care promotion by pharmacists. To upgrade to a PhD it could have a number of elements Develop and evaluate a storytelling package to encou rage refugees from specific ethnic/language backgrounds to increase engagement with self -care in the Australian context. Develop and evaluate resource materials for professional organisations to distribute to pharmacists to improve their understanding when connecting to refugees.

For example, endothelial cells lining arterial vessels adopt different morphologies according to the direction and magnitude of shear stress. Disturbance of flow due to abrupt changes in vessel geometry (i.e. branching and sharp turns of vessels or stenosis) is likely to have major consequences on cellular signalling and gene expression. Furthermore, disturbed flow patterns in the r egions of stenosis can induce pro- atherogenic phenotypes in endothelial cells. Different degrees of mechanical stress and blood flow dynamics regulate different aspects of immunity, cellular adhesion and migration, which are essential for the development o f atherosclerosis, as well as in adaptive and innate humoral immunity. The aim of this project is to elucidate the mechanosensory complexes that are mediating the endothelial responses to blood flow dynamics, physiological as well as pathological, using advanced imaging techniques, microfluidics, animal models and clinical samples. This project provides an excellent opportunity to receive training in microfluidics, basic cell and molecular biology techniques such as immunoblotting, flow cytometry, fluoresc ence/confocal microscopy, intravital microscopy.

(co-supervisor) Mechanotransduction in blood cells and thrombosis and inflammation Discipline of Human Bioscience Campus: Bundoora West PhD Project Project Description The proposed project will study the effect of shear stress and mechanotransduction in blood cells, such as platelets and various immune cells to identify specific mechanoreceptors responsible for the regulation of platelet adhesion, activation and aggregat ion, and ultimately thrombus formation and haemostasis. Shear stress associated with blood flow is a major determinant of vascular function and homeostasis. Different degrees of mechanical stress and blood flow dynamics regulate different aspects of immuni ty, cellular adhesion and migration, which are essential for the development of atherosclerosis, as well as in adaptive and innate humoral immunity. In fact, there is a new area of research showing that changes in shear stress can control immune responses . However, definitive evidence showing how immunity is subject of the mechanical forces of blood flow is lacking.

Pain can be debilitating and can lead to absence from school or work. Treatment options include simple analgesics and non- steroidal anti -inflammatory drugs, the oral contraceptive pill and, in severe cases, opioid medications.[1] Response to treatment can vary, and some women seek out other treatments like Chinese herbal medicine (CHM), that are perceived to be more effective at treating the underlying cause rather than the symptoms.[2] The evidence for CHM for dysmenorrhoea is growing. A recent Cochrane r eview found promising evidence for the use of CHM in reducing menstrual pain in primary dysmenorrhoea.[3] Findings from a review of nationwide prescribing practices in Taiwan found that 54% of women with primary dysmenorrhea used CHM, with 92.2% of these w omen seeking out herbal medicine for their menstrual symptoms.[4] The review found that formulas Dang gui shao yao san (Dang gui and Peony formula), Jia wei xiao yao san (modified Bupleurum and Dang gui formula), and Wen jing tang (Dang gui and Evodia form ula) were the three most commonly prescribed formulas. The prescribing practices of Australian practitioners of Chinese medicine (CM) for dysmenorrhoea are unknown. This project will identify the prescribing practices of Australian CM practitioners, evaluate the clinical trial evidence for the CHMs they use for dysmenorrhoea, and present the evidence back to practitioners to support their evidence- based practice. A questionnaire will be developed and piloted to identify the CHM treatments used by CM practi tioners. After obtaining human ethics approval, the survey will be distributed nationally. The most frequently prescribed CHM formula will be selected for evaluation of efficacy and safety. A systematic review and meta- analysis of the formula will be conducted using the methods developed by the Cochrane Collaboration. The findings will be disseminated to practitioners through formal and informal methods. References: [1] Osayande AS, Mehulic S. Diagnosis and initial management dysmenorrhea.

This formula, consist ing of five Chinese herbs, is indicated for cough with white sputum, nausea and vomiting, fullness sensation in the chest and hypochondria as well as globus hystericus [1]. In modern days, BXHPT is still widely used for a variety of clinical conditions such as chronic mild stress [2] and globus hystericus [3]. BXHPT has shown antidepressant hystericus, sometimes cal led Globus Pharynges, is characterised by a subjective sensation of a lump or mass in the throat with no abnormal physical finding in the throat. It is reported that approximately 4% of new referrals to ear, nose and throat clinics due to this condition. I n addition, 46% of healthy individuals also experience this condition with a peak incidence at their middle age. It is believed that many factors (such as psychological problems and stress) contribute to the development of globus hystericus. The mainstream treatment focuses on explanation and reassurance. Other treatments consist of anti - depressants and cognitive behavioural therapy [5]. This research project proposes to explore BXHP T's clinical applications through systematically reviewing the classical and modern literature as well as examine its mechanisms of action for globus hystericus using computational analyses and biotechnology methods. It is anticipated that a herb- compound -target network will be established and the findings will lead t o potential drug discovery. Training on computational analyses of chemical compounds and target proteins will be provided to the research student. Computational methods will be employed to screen herbal compounds for potential activity against selected biomolecular targets, and to propose possible mechanisms of action of selected herbs. Homology modelling or fold recognition techniques will be used to construct proteins with no known experimentally -obtained structure. Automated docking will be used to screen libraries of herbal small- molecule ligands by predicting binding locations and approximate binding affinities. Complexes identified to be of potential importance will be examined by biophysical molecular simulations to elucidate the impact of ligand binding on the structures on protein targets, as well as implications for altering the functions of these proteins.

Surgery is a critical aspect of health care. Annually 2.5 million surgeries are performed in Australia. Managing complications and enhancing recovery after surgery are the key aspects of post -operative care. Patient engagement and collaboration are essential to facilitate patient safety and recovery. Internationally, patient engagement in direct health care, is considered the \"holy grail\" or \"a blockbuster drug\" of this century.1 Patient engagement is the No 2 Standard of the National Safety and Quality Health Service Standards, Australia. It requires \"Partnering with Consumers\". A substantial body of literature of patients with chronic diseases shows enhanced patient engagement is associated with reduced hospital and emergence readmission. 2 However there is sparse information about patient engagement in their direct health care in acute settings. A literature review of patients in acute care found patient involvement in the pre-, during- and post -surgical stages consistently came up as an important theme to pat ients' experience. 3 Taking part in their own care or being denied of opportunities to be involved lead to different patient experience. PONV is common, and the incidence is 60 to 80% among surgical patients with moderate to high risks. Acupressure wristband has been found to be effective in preventing and managing PONV, and is now part of routine management plan for PONV at Northern Health. We found that some patients used acupressure wristband to manage their PONV whereas others did not. This project aims to examine if intra - and post - operative use of acupressure wristbands improves patients' engagement in their own care and PONV outcomes. The acupressure group will be compared with the non- acupressure group. Level of patient engagement will be assessed us ing a reliable and validated \"Patient Activation Measure\". 4 Patient engagement activities and their interaction with anaesthetists and nurses will be assessed through a well - practiced and finely tuned direct observation technique. Clinical outcomes will be incidence of PONV and post-operative anti -emetics use. References: [1] Manary MP et al. N Engl J Med 368 (2013) 201. [2] Greene J, Hibbard JH.

One of the most important of these, and presently unavoidable, is the lung damage arising from urgent need to intubate and ventilate these infants who have immature and incompletely developed lungs. An alternative approach has been to develop an artificial placenta to oxygenate the blood, so that mechanical lung ventilation is not necessary. This successfully maintained goat fetuses for up to 3 weeks, but it failed to promote continued growth and organ maturation, and these fetuses remained incapable of independent life. It was also necessary to place these animal fetuses in a bath of mock amniotic fluid on the assumption that 'fetus -like' conditions should be maintained. (Unno et al, 1993; Kozuma S et al (1999). These approaches are unlikely to be adopted in clinical practice. In addition to the risk of infection, the high resistance of the extracorporeal circuit produces a lower than no rmal umbilical blood flow, requiring high partial pressures of oxygen to deliver sufficient oxygen to the fetus. This then induces closure of the ductus arteriosus (a fetal 'shunt' that must remain open), and also risks tissue damage due to 'oxygen toxicit y'. Problems also arise from the use of pumps to drive fetal blood through the extra- corporeal circuit; pumps cause small but progressive damage to red blood cells, resulting in the release of vasoactive substances that then necessitates the administration of vasodilator agents. Our proposal is to design a pump- less, low volume circuit based on the design of Rochow et al (2014), which incorporates multiple, small, rectangular silicon membrane gas exchangers connected in parallel, and stacked vertically. O ur innovation is to incorporate one- way valves in the device, and to make it compressible to assist blood flow through the circuit. Significantly, each pulse of compression will be triggered by the neonate's own ECG; the amplitude of each compression shoul d be regulated by the arterial pressure generated by the fetal heart. The successful design of such of extracorporeal blood gas exchanger will have significant implications not only for the rescue of very preterm babies (who may be able to survive without intubation and mechanical lung ventilation), but for other areas of medicine where lung and kidney functions are critically compromised.

To test this proposal, under funding obtained from Cerebral Palsy Alliance, we will now study pregnant macaque monkeys to show that: (a) if extra oral creatine given to the mother results in creatine loading in the brain of neonates, and; (b) if this simple intervention protects the neonate's brain against oxygen starvation at birth. Importantly, this primate study will also show that creatine supplementation is safe for the mother and baby, and will provide essential evidence justifying clinical trials in pregnant women. Specific and specialist training in the monitoring of pregnant macaque monkeys, procedures for inducing acute hypoxia and birth, and the monitoring and care of the macaque neonate for up to 5 days after birth - will be given by the trained staff already engaged in the project at ONPRC. Ethical approval for this project has already been obtained by a NIH -approved committee at ONPRC. References: Dickinson H, Bain Middleton P, Crowther CA, Walker DW.

ASD is diagnosed by social communication deficits and repetitive behaviour and is five times more common in males. Many gene mutations that alter neuronal communication, including in the Nlgn3 gene encoding Neuroligin -3 (1, 2) have been identified in patients. Many ASD patients display gastrointestinal dysfunction however the cause is unknown. The Enteric nervous system (ENS) is the intrinsic nervous system of the gut and mediates gastrointestinal secretion and motility. The ENS contains neurons with different neurochemical coding arranged in two ganglionated plexuses along the length of the gastrointestinal tract. We hypothesise that changes in the ENS due to auti sm-associated gene mutation contribute to gut problems in ASD. We will study the Neuroligin- 3R451C mouse model of autism which expresses a missense mutation identified in ASD patients. These mice demonstrate altered gastrointestinal motility in response to drugs that modulate the GABA A receptor. Although the GABA A receptor is well studied in brain, its function is gut is unclear. In this project whole cell patch clamp electrophysiological techniques (3) will be used to determine the properties of wild type and NL3R451C mutant enteric neuronal properties in the mouse colon. We aim to: 1. Characterise enteric neurons based on functional parameters using whole cell patch clamp electrophysiological recordings combined with single cell RT -PCR and immunocytochemistry for neuronal markers. 2. Identify neurochemical profiles of cells responding to GABAA receptor modulators. 3. Assess whether the major neuronal subtypes present in wild type ENS are altered in the NL3R451C mouse model of autism. Outcome measures include: Functional assessment of enteric neurons including amplitude of responses to GABA and other locally applied drugs. Morphology of neurons based on cell filling with biocytin contained in the recording pipette. Gene expression of individual neurons based on cytoplasm aspiration and PCR Novel information on enteric neuronal subtypes Novel information on the role of GABA in the ENS.

Contact interactions in a mouse model of autism Neurodevelopment and Disease Research Program Campus: Bundoora West PhD/Masters Project Project Description Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder that affects 1 in 68 children. Although ASD is diagnosed by social communication deficits and repetitive behaviour, inflammatory disorders are also commonly reported. The precise aetiology of ASD is unknown, however, mutations in many gene mutations encoding synaptic proteins have been identified in patients (1). The gut houses the largest immune system in the body and the nervous and immune systems communicate in a bidirectional manner. The in tegrity of the mucosal barrier is critical for gut homeostasis and is partly regulated by the intrinsic nervous system of the gut; the enteric nervous system (ENS). A mutation in the gene encoding the Neuroligin -3 synaptic protein (NL3 R451C) was identified in autism patients (2) NL3R451C mice (3) expressing this mutation display behaviours relevant to ASD, gut dysfunction and preliminary data suggests that these mice also have altered immune pathways. We hypothesis that mutations in genes encoding synaptic proteins disrupt the immune system in ASD. Data from the current laboratory show that NL3R451C mice bred on a mixed background stain (mb; C57/Bl6 - Imj-Sv129 ) have altered and faecal microbi dysbiosis. NL3R451C mice bred on a pure C57/Bl6 (B6) strain also have reduced caecal weight and Peyer's patch cells secrete higher levels of the innate immunity modulator, NGAL (neurophil gelatinase- associated lipocalin/lipocalin 2) iminary data also suggest that B6NL3R451C mice have altered proportions of immune cell classes in Peyer's patch gut -associated lymphoid tiss ue. We aim to: 1. Investigate changes in inflammatory mediators in the NL3R451C mouse model of autism using Fluorescent activated cell sorting (FACS), immunocytochemistry and qPCR in cell and blood samples. 2. Correlate gut microbial population profiles with spatiotemporal location in wild type and NL3R451C mice using bioinformati c analysis techniques including predictive function analysis. 3. Assess for changes in innervation of gut -associated lymphoid tissue in wild type and NL3R451C mice Outcome measures include: Characterisation of immune marker changes resulting from a nervous system mutation associated with autism Identification of differences in microbial populations in different gut regions Characterisation of microbial populations in wildtype and mutant mice Characterisation of innervation of gut -associated lymphoid tissue (i.e. Peyer's patches) in the mouse small intestine.

Advances in this area suggested that the addition of ternary additive such as calcium phosphate (CP) into indomethacin interactive mixture resulted in enhanced dissolution [2- 3]. There is some indication that this enhancement could be due to reduced powder agglomerate strength [2]. However, there are still some unanswered questions: what are the optimum size and ratio for the additive in this mixture, whether there is a direct relationship between the powder flow and the enhanced dissolution and whether this model can be applied to other poorly water -soluble drugs? Carotenoids in human diet are mainly used as precursors of Vitamin A and as antioxidants [4]. The high hydrophobicity of carotenoids makes them insoluble in aqueous systems, and therefore they have a poor intake in the body. Currently, oily form and powdered commercially available forms of the -carotene with wide range of bioavailability [5]. Overcoming this difficulty could open a new windo w of developing the carotenoid formulation with enhanced drug release. In this project, the effect of CP size and ratio on the dissolution of indomethacin from Indomethacin- CP binary mixtures as well as the powder strength distribution will be studied. The project aims to propose a model of enhanced dissolution of drug by the addition of optimum size and ratio of excipient to other poorly water -soluble drugs in interactive mixtures. Indomethacin and CP particles will be micronised using a jet fluid energy mill and using spray drying. Micronised CP particles will be classified into three sizes (< 5 m, 5-10 m and 10-15 m) u measurement will be done using particle sizer. 10 g each o f binary mixtures from Indomethacin:CP will be prepared using the following ratios: 10:1, 5:1, 1:1, 1:5 and 1:5. The dissolution of these mixtures will be conducted by a dissolution apparatus connected to a UV -visible spectrophotometer using a USP paddle method. The powder flow of each mixture will be measured using the texture probe analyser. The measured powder flow will be done to study the correlation between the enhancement of dissolution and the potential decrease in powder strength by enhanced powder flow. The previous optimised model will be used on another poorly water -soluble drug (powdered carotenoid oil) using the same methods and with the optimum size and ratio of the excipient. The main research objectives was therefore to develop a drug -excip ient model with optimized size and ratio that can show enhanced dissolution of poorly water -soluble drug models and to study the relationship between this enhancement and the decrease in powder strength distribution of that model by relating this to powder flow. The outcomes of this study can be summarised in the following points: 1. Indomethacin- CP with optimum CP size and ratio will have enhanced dissolution. 2. Optimising the method of preparing the micronized drug model by spray drying or milling. 2. The enhanced dissolution of the optimum size and ratio of CP in indomethacin- CP mixture will have decreased powder strength related to the powder flow. 3. The developed model for the Indomethacin- CP mixture with good correlation between dissolution and powder strength is applicable to other poorly water -soluble drugs such as -carotene.

[4] T delivery of a novel therapy to improve neurological outcomes following fetal growth restriction Neurodevelopment in Health and Disease Research Program Campus: Bundoora West PhD / Masters P roject Project Description : Fetal growth restriction (FGR) occurs in 5- 10% of pregnancies and is a leading cause of perinatal morbidity and mortality [1]. FGR is defined as the failure of the fetus to reach its genetic growth potential and can occur when there i s an inadequate supply of oxygen and nutrients to the fetus because of poor placental function. Surviving growth- restricted babies can have abnormal brain development [2] and an increased risk of learning difficulties, intellectual and cognitive deficits, motor deficits, cerebral palsy and autism [3]. We have identified a novel thyroid hormone analogue that can potentially repair brain injury and reduce the morbidity associated with FGR. The overall aim of this project is to develop, optimize and validate an alternate and non- invasive mode of drug delivery using core technology developed by Prof Leslie Yeo at RMIT. This is a portable, handheld device that enables the aerosolisation of drugs for delivery via inhalation to the nose or lung. For the first time, this technology will be used to aerosolise the thyroid hormone analogue, optimize the dosing regimen based on biodistribution studies, and test its safety and efficacy in our established and validated animal model of FGR. Our specific aims are: 1) To sh ow that the thyroid hormone analogue can be nebulised, and then administered as an aerosol; 2) To show that this method of administration gives in vivo concentrations consistent with biological effect; 3) To show that the thyroid hormone analogue administered as an aerosol to newborn FGR offspring improves brain structure and long -term neurobehaviour. This project will use a rodent model of FGR where we ligate the uterine vessels at mid- pregnancy to restrict blood flow and nutrient supply to fetuses [4]. Co ntrols are generated from pregnancies where the uterine artery is not ligated. We will then deliver the aerosolised thyroid hormone analogue (or vehicle) to control and FGR offspring after birth. The brains will then be collected and assessed using histological, immunohistochemical and molecular techniques. Separate cohorts of offspring will be grown to adolescence and assessed using a suite of neurobehavioral tests. This project will provide the essential preclinical animal data to show that we have a new drug, and a novel method of application (aerosol) that will transform neonatal practice, and provide a treatment for a serious disease (brain injury) that is currently without a therapy. If successful, this will have worldwide applicability, and because i t is 'low tech', it will be suitable for all levels of medical care (1st & 3rd world). By the end of their candidature students will have expertise in small animal surgery and handling, aerosol drug delivery techniques, drug biodistribution, neurobehavioural assessment, tissue collection, processing and sectioning, histology, immunohistochem istry, qPCR, image analysis, data analysis, interpretation, statistics and scientific writing. All specialist training will be provided. References: [1] Bernstein, I. M., et al, Am J Obstet Gynecol 182 , 198 -206 [3] Geva, Pediatrics 118, 91- 100 [4] McDougall, A. et a Bioactive Quality Control Framework for Kakadu Plum Indigenous Health Research Group Campus: Bundoora West PhD Project Project Description Background Kakadu plum (Terminalia ferdinandiana) is one of the important traditional fruits in the Australia Aboriginal diet, particularly within certain tribes in central Arnhem land who regard the fruit more as a medicine than a food (1,2). Chief Supervisor Dr Daniel Sze has previously published his findings (3-6) that certain fractions of the Kakadu Plum crude extracts exhibit strong anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidative and pro-apoptotic properties. However, extracts such as these show batch -to-batch inconsistency that is often seen in translating the complex -mixtures present in traditional medicines into health -enhancing consumer products. To address this, Dr Sze and his team has developed a QPAR (quantitative - pattern -activity- relationship) chemometric approach to identify the multiple chemical ingredients and relate them to the numerous biological mechanisms of action (7). This research will also build on the previous successful RMIT School of Health and Biomedical Sciences Transitional Seed Grants for Teaching and Research Staff (2017) titled: \"Chemometric Analysis to Identify Bioactivity -Related Chemical ol Markers in Kakadu Plum Extracts\" (Sze, Dias & Chan). In this PhD project, Prof Eddie Pang & Dr Daniel Dias will contribute to the chemical fingerprinting aspect; Dr Bryce Feltis & Dr Vincent Chan will supervise the bioactivity -based experimental platforms relating to anti - oxidative and anti-inflammatory activities; and Dr Daniel Sze and Dr Alex Ng will be responsible for the chemometrics aspect. A/Prof Aunty Kerrie will be supporting the documentation of the traditional usage of the Kakadum plum and advice on the provision of the Kakadu plum. Aims and Hypothesis The aims of this project are to develop a Bioactive Quality Control framework for Kakadu plum through mapping their chemical fingerprinting and relating these compounds to bioactivities present in the extracts by chemometrics. The hypothesis is that there are several compound classes that may work synergistically or alternately suppress specific bioactivities. PhD Research Plan 1. Different Kakadu plum whole fruit crude preparations under a range of extraction conditions for chemical fingerprinting 2. Bioactivity data on the anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative properties of each whole extract will be determined using established, robust bioactivity platforms (8) and assays. 3. Chemometric framework models will be constructed to calculate the multiple key chemical metabolites that contribute to specific bioactivities, either synergistically or suppressively, leading to the establishment of a bioactive quality control framework. Significance and Innovation This research project provides an innovative multi -disciplinary approach through evidence -based research with the ultimate aim of standardising Kakadu plum extracts for health enhancement and improved batch consistency. The identification of key bioactive natural products in complex mixtures of Kakadu plum will provide critical knowledge of bioactive quality control markers may pave the way for future pre -clinical studies or translational phase 1 human clinical studies.

Primary Supervisor: Dr Daniel -yuen SZE daniel.sze@rmit.edu.au Associate Design and synthesis of an organic nanostructure to combine adjuvant radiotherapy with photodynamic & chemo- therapy to enhance radiation effects on colon cancer Neurodevelopment in Health & Disease Bundoora West PhD Project Project Description We pioneered in employing nano- materials for radio- sensitization (dose enhancements). The outcome of our research combined with data from other researchers around the world clearly shows that significant sensitization or radiation dose enhancements can only be obtained at low energy radiations. All currently known such nanoparticles investigated for radio- sensitization are of metallic atoms of high atomic numbers such as gold. This leads us to propose a compound nano- structure to be combined wi th a photodynamic based molecule. This compound upon exposure ionising radiations will cause the metallic atoms to generate light via fluorescence and this light will activate the molecule and generates reactive oxygen hence the whole structure will enhanc e radiotherapy and also will act as a photodynamic agent. Moreover, we propose and for the first time, to conjugate the whole nano- compound with a small 5FU chemotherapy agent to enhance radiotherapy and activate photodynamic therapy and will let the chemo- agent act to inhibit the repair of the DNA . The prospective student is required to have Specific and specialist training in the synthesis of nano- particles and radiation applications. Also they will be trained in radiation dosimetry and radiation protection. Ethical approval for this project is not required. References: [1] D. L. Hershman, et al., Oncology, 2009, 23, 227. [2] P.
