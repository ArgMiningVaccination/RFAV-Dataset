Because of the location of the problem, most people are awkward and reluctant to talk about. Unfortunately, ignoring the problem doesn't make it go away and it can become increasingly painful, with symptoms that include intense itching and rectal bleeding. Natural treatment and [Ayurvedic medicine for piles](/products/piles-care-ayurvedic-piles-medicine/) is often the preferred choice as surgical procedures are usually unnecessary and fraught with risks. Such procedures should only be reserved for worst case scenarios, and in those situations too, it is advisable to turn to minimally invasive (techniques with tiny incisions that require little time for wound healing and lower risk of infection) Ayurvedic surgical techniques that were pioneered in ancient India. Before we look at the Ayurvedic treatments for piles in those worst cases, let's look at how we can use Ayurvedic medicines for piles relief. These home remedies for hemorrhoids are regarded as highly effective as most cases of piles are not severe and do not require surgical intervention. 11 Home Remedies for Hemorrhoids 1. Guggulu as Piles Home Remedy To get relief from piles pain , you can either take guggulu supplements or any Ayurvedic piles medicine that contains the herb as a primary ingredient. Guggulu has long been revered in Ayurved for its healing potential for a variety of health conditions. Its most notable properties are its analgesic or pain relieving and anti-inflammatory effects, which can help to reduce inflammation and swelling of the veins around the anus, while reducing painful symptoms. Studies suggest that guggulu formulations can not only facilitate healing of the hemorrhoids, but can also [relieve constipation](https://drvaidyas.com/products/constipation-relief-ayurvedic-tablets/) and ease bowel movements. 2. Haritaki as Home Remedy for Fissure Haritaki or harda is another powerful anti-inflammatory herb that is widely used in Ayurvedic treatment for piles and is noted for its mild laxative effect. The laxative and digestive health benefits can help to restore digestive functions that are severely impaired when dealing with piles, easing stool passage and relieving constipation, which is the main cause of piles. By lowering the risk of digestive disturbances, it also reduces the risk of piles flareups and painful symptoms. Most importantly, its proven anti-inflammatory and analgesic effects can reduce pain and inflammation, facilitating healing. The risk of infection is also reduced thanks to the herb's antimicrobial properties. Haritaki is one of the three ingredients in the age old triphala formulation and it is also an ingredient in some of the [best Ayurvedic medicines for piles](https://drvaidyas.com/collections/ayurvedic-piles-care-medicines) and constipation. 3. Lembodi as a Home Remedy for Hemorrhoids Lembodi may not be nearly as well known as neem leaves, but this ingredient is simply the seeds of the neem tree. They are just as useful as the leaves and can be used to treat other kinds of health problems, most notably problems with the digestive system. Lembodi is helpful in dealing with piles because of its high soluble fiber content. This helps to bulk up stools and increase mucilage, easing their passage and reducing pain when passing stools. While lembodi can be used as a fiber supplement, when dealing with piles it is best to use it along with herbs like guggulu and haritaki. 4. Psyllium Husk The best-known fiber supplement, familiar to almost every Indian as isabgol, psyllium husk is a gentle and bulk-forming laxative. As it contains both soluble and insoluble fiber it helps to both bulk up stools while preventing hardening and easing passage through the gastrointestinal tract. This is why it is used as a great home remedy for fissures and its symptoms. While psyllium husk is not a cure for piles, it can address the underlying cause, which is most commonly constipation. Regular and healthy intake of fiber can also lower the risk of piles recurring in the future. When using fiber supplements like psyllium, just make sure to start slow and in small doses as a sudden high intake of fiber can exacerbate indigestion, gas, and bloating. 5. Fomentation and Soaks For quick relief from piles pain, you can also try the ancient Ayurvedic recommendation of ushna avagaha sweda or hot fomentation/sitz baths. This is ideally done soon after bowel movements as it helps to reduce the pain and can also facilitate healing. The addition of triphala powder to the water will increase its efficacy because of anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and pain-relieving properties of herbs used in the formulation. The warm soak will also help to cleanse the site, reducing any risk of infection, especially when dealing with bleeding piles. The healing effect of sitz baths for piles has also been confirmed by research. For best results try to soak in the bath for at least 15 minutes. 6. Ayurvedic Oils as Piles Home Remedy Ayurved is probably most popular to the wider world for its amazing massage oils with herbs like brahmi that promote deep relaxation. However, Ayurved has more to offer with a number of herbal oils that boast anti-inflammatory and analgesic or pain-relieving properties. The most notable of these oils for hemorrhoids treatment at home is [Pain Relief Oil](https://drvaidyas.com/products/pain-relief-nirgundi-ayurvedic-oil-for-joint-pain/), which is known to even help with arthritic pain. When used as a topical application, the oil can also reduce piles pain, ease stool passage, and facilitate healing. Similarly, jatyadi oil with herbal extracts from neem, mulethi, and other herbs can also help provide relief when used as a topical application. 7. Coconut Oil If you can't get your hands on a bottle of nirgundi or jatyadi oil soon enough, you can even turn to India's favorite hair oil. Coconut oil is known to be a natural and gentle moisturizer, which is why it has a soothing effect when applied topically to piles or hemorrhoids. There is also research showing that coconut oil promotes wound healing and forms a protective barrier over the skin. This will help to reduce itching and irritation that is common when dealing with piles. Additional Home Remedies for Hemorrhoids: There are several home remedies that can help [get rid of piles naturally](https://drvaidyas.com/blogs/all/how-to-get-rid-of-piles-naturally): - Sitz baths: Taking two sitz baths everyday can help ease the pain associated with piles while reducing the swelling. - Heeng: Drinking a glass of water with some Heeng (Asafoetida) powder can help with anti-inflammatory properties to bring relief from piles. - Witch Hazel: This Astringent can help reduce piles mass swelling when applied a small amount directly on the area. - Aloe Vera: While Aloe Vera can help provide a soothing effect when applied directly, [Aloe Vera Juice](https://drvaidyas.com/products/aloe-vera-juice)can also help improve digestion. Home Remedies for Hemorrhoids in Extreme Cases: Although most cases of piles or hemorrhoids can be addressed with a Hemorrhoids treatment at home and Ayurvedic medicines listed above, there are some patients who suffer from severe or chronic piles. In these cases, home treatments alone may not provide adequate or long-term relief and this requires more drastic intervention. Ancient Ayurvedic physicians also devised a solution for this problem with a minimally invasive parasurgical procedure. Described as khara sutra therapy, the procedure features in the revered Ayurvedic texts of Sushruta and Charaka, and is still regarded as extremely effective. Unlike other surgical treatments it does not require a hospital stay. However, the procedure should only be performed by skilled Ayurvedic physicians in a clinical setting. The procedure lasts just 30 to 45 minutes, involving a minor surgical excision, and the patient can be discharged within a few hours. Recovery is rapid within 3 to 5 days and patients do not need pharmaceutical drugs that otherwise cause side effects. Studies show that the procedure is safe and effective, with a low recurrence rate of just 3.33 percent, as compared to the 26 percent recurrence rate with conventional surgery. Remember that although [Ayurvedic medicines for piles](https://drvaidyas.com/products/piles-relief-pack) and treatments are highly effective, Ayurved is a holistic health care system. The focus is on disease prevention, not just curing disease. This means that a sustainable solution requires changes to your diet and lifestyle so that the underlying cause of piles is also addressed.
