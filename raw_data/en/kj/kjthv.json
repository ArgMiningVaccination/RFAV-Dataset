Increasing HPV vaccine uptake will require targeted policy solutions to navigate the landscape that COVID-19 has forever changed. It is with this context that we present HPV Vaccine Policy Landscape: Public Health Strategies. This resource provides an in-depth look at HPV vaccination pathways across the United States and across the globe, with a particular focus on state-level policies that have yielded high rates of adolescent vaccine uptake. We look at the challenges and barriers to expanded uptake, and iden- tify available pathways for expanded uptake, with emphasis on school-based vaccination campaigns, state policy approaches, and the role of health care providers. Our current moment shines a light on many facets of public health policy and vaccine uptake. It is our hope that this report will highlight the roles that state policy-makers, educational institutions, and health care providers can play in improving public health outcomes, and serve as a tool in navigating this landscape effectively. Foreword Over the past two years, we have borne witness to the enormous costs of a public health crisis brought on by a highly trans- missible illness, COVID-19. We have been forced to contend with the ways in which these enormous costs fall disproportion- ately on Black, Indigenous, Asian American, and Latino communities, unhoused people, and people with disabilities. Over 900,000 people in the United States have lost their lives to COVID-19 to date, with data collec - tion issues continuing to limit our full un- derstanding of the impact of the pandemic. Furthermore, the health care cost of survival \u2014 in delayed care, mental health impacts, violence, and long-term COVID symptoms \u2014 remains to be calculated. During this time, we have also seen public health guidance take center stage in an increasingly polarized political climate. Guidance and mandates around COVID-19 vaccination have been a key component of the country's widely successful vaccination campaign, but have also been met with sub - stantial pushback from those who cannot or will not be vaccinated.

The virus is spread through vaginal, anal, and oral sex with someone living with HPV. Accord- ing to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), HPV is the most common sexually transmitted infection in the United States, with an estimated 42.5 million people currently living with HPV and 13 million peo - ple newly acquiring the virus each year.1 While some people may not develop symp - toms from HPV and may have the virus resolve spontaneously, the virus can still present a great danger as it can lead to six different types of cancers, including cancer of the cervix, va- gina, vulva, penis, anus, and oropharynx. 40% of penile cancers.\"3 Over 36,000 cases of cancer are estimated to be caused by HPV each year in the United States.4 In addition to the thousands of lives lost annu- ally, HPV-associated cancers and conditions are estimated to cost $8 billion in the United States each year.5 The HPV vaccine can help protect people from HPV and HPV-associated cancers. In the Unit - ed States alone, the HPV vaccine is estimated to prevent around 33,000 cancer cases annu- ally.6 However, many states still have low HPV vaccination rates, leaving many residents at risk of grave and sometimes fatal illness. Even when cervical cancer is not fatal, it can severely affect fertility depending on time of detection and available treatment options.7 This map illustrates the age-adjusted rate of HPV-attributable cancers across California counties. The variation in rates highlights the importance of a coordinated HPV prevention strategy that accounts for access barriers in both rural and urban counties. For more information, see Appendix B.FIGURE 1 A Look at California Based on data from the California Cancer Registry California County-level Age-adjusted Rates of HPV-attributable Cancers per 100,000 people (2012 2016)8 Legend Age-adjusted rate 9.0-9.9 10.0-10.9 11.0-11.96individual hasn't yet been exposed to, so it is important to receive the vaccine before potential exposure through sexual activity. Even when vaccination is not possible be - fore a person becomes sexually active, the national Advisory Committee on Immuni- zation Practices (ACIP) recommends \"catch- up\" vaccinations for everyone up to age 26.14 Because the HPV vaccine protects against multiple strains of HPV, even if an individual has been exposed to or has contracted one strain of HPV, they could still benefit from protection from other strains. WHO SHOULD GET THE HPV VACCINE? The HPV vaccine is most effective if adminis- tered before potential exposure. It is recom- mended by the CDC for all children at ages 11 or 12, and by the American Cancer Society for children ages 9 to 12.15 The vaccine elicits a higher immune response from individuals aged 11 to 12 than in older teens, meaning that individuals who receive the vaccine be - fore their 15th birthday can receive two doses as opposed to the three doses needed for those 15 and older.16 HPV is also known to cause oropharyngeal cancer, or cancer of the throat, tongue, and tonsils.9 Rates of HPV-associated oro - pharyngeal cancer are rising dramatically, with some experts suggesting this cancer may become more common than cervical cancer.10 HPV currently causes around 9,000 cases of oropharyngeal cancers each year in the United States.11 The HPV Vaccine WHAT IS THE HPV VACCINE? The HPV vaccine protects against HPV and the cancers associated with HPV. While there are over 100 different kinds of HPV, most health problems associated with HPV (including cancer) are linked to a handful of types and thus are targeted by these vaccines.12 The vaccine can prevent most cases of cervical cancer if given before a person is exposed to the virus. It is recommended by the CDC for all children at ages 11 or 12, and by the American Cancer Society for children ages 9 to 12.The vaccine can prevent most cases of cer - vical cancer if given before a person is ex - posed to the virus. The vaccine also prevents vaginal/vulvar cancer and can prevent geni- tal warts, anal cancer, and strains of HPV re - lated to oral cancers. While the vaccine was originally targeted at \"females aged 926 years,\"13 vaccinating all people can provide a protective effect against these cancers by decreasing transmission. The vaccine only protects against strains of HPV that an 7 HPV VACCINE POLICY LANDSCAPE : Public Health Strategiesthrough age 26 who were not previously vac - cinated).25 Despite these recommendations, HPV vaccination rates in the United States as a whole, and in most individual states, have been consistently lower than rates necessary to achieve strong herd immu- nity and do not meet the national Healthy People 2030 target of 80% HPV vaccination uptake.26 In 2020, 58.6% of United States ad- olescents aged 13 -17 years were up to date on HPV vaccination, with uptake as low as 31.9% in Mississippi.27 According to CDC es- timates, only Rhode Island has achieved the Healthy People 2030 target of 80% uptake.28 The HPV vaccine is recommended by ACIP for everyone through the age of 26 years if they haven't yet been vaccinated. Adults over the age of 26 are more likely to have been exposed to specific serotypes and have fewer sexual partners, and thus cost effec - tiveness of providing the vaccine to that age group tends to decline.17 In 2019, updated recommendations noted that shared clini- cal decision-making was recommended to identify people aged 27 to 45 years who may benefit from catch-up HPV vaccination.18 THE HISTORY OF THE HPV VACCINE The CDC first issued guidelines in 2006 for females between ages 11 and 12 to receive the HPV vaccine through ACIP.19 In 2011 ACIP expanded those guidelines to recom- mend the vaccine for males between ages 11 and 12.20 Early controversy around possible school-age mandates for the vaccine cen- tered on parental sensitivity to the primary mode of HPV transmission (sexual activity).21 Concerns about vaccine safety were investi- gated by the Institute of Medicine and the CDC; both entities found the vaccine to be safe.23,23, Since the vaccine has been in use, among teen girls, infection with HPV types that cause the most HPV-related cancers and genital warts have dropped 86%. Among adult women, the infection rate has dropped 71%.24 HPV VACCINE UPTAKE IN THE UNITED STATES HPV vaccination has been associated with decreased HPV prevalence in the United States and is currently recommended by the ACIP for people at ages 11 or 12 (with catch-up recommendations for all people FIGURE 2 HPV Vaccination in CA Based on data from the National Immunization Survey (2020) In 2020, California had a higher rate of HPV vaccination coverage for adolescents aged 13-17 years (62.3%) than the United States (58.6%).29 However, California has not met the Healthy People 2030 target of 80%. The following table ranks states by up-to- date HPV vaccination rates among adoles- cents aged 13-17 years in 2020 based on data collected by the National Immunization Sur - vey. Participants are considered up-to-date when they have received the recommended doses of the HPV vaccine, either two doses if they received the vaccine before they were 15 or three doses if they receive the vaccine after the age of 15.TARGET 80%CA 62.3% US 58.6%8and global groups, such as the National Vaccine Advisory Committee and the World Health Organization, have recommended public health leaders develop and use strat - egies that bolster provider communication and that are tailored to address parental concerns.33 Non-physician providers, such as pharmacists or dental health professionals, have unique roles to play in HPV vaccination recommendations as well, though addition- al research and strategy development may be necessary to support unified and effec - tive messaging.34BARRIERS TO HPV VACCINE UPTAKE While the HPV vaccine has been approved for use since 2006, the country remains far from reaching the national Healthy People 2030 target of 80% HPV vaccination uptake.31 Researchers have identified a number of barriers that have led to low HPV vaccine uptake, including inadequate provider rec - ommendation, low parental demand, lack of personal knowledge, financial concerns, sexuality-related concerns, low perceived risk, and concerns about safety.32 National FIGURE 3 State Rates of Up-to-date HPV Vaccinations Among Adolescents Aged 30.0-49.9% 50.0-59.9% 60.0-69.9% 80.0-89.9%Based on data from the National Immunization Survey (2020)30 With vaccination strategies developed at the state level, there is considerable varia- tion in HPV vaccination rates across the country. This map illustrates up-to-date HPV vaccination among adolescents aged 13 17. For more information, see Appendix C. D.C.RI9 HPV VACCINE POLICY LANDSCAPE : Public Health Strategies awareness is on par with white parents, Af - rican American parents were significantly less likely to vaccinate their daughters.39 In another example, a U.S. study found that lesbian respondents with vaccine awareness were less likely (8.5%) to initiate vaccination compared to bisexual respondents (33.2%) and heterosexual counterparts (28.4%).40 Studies focused on vaccine uptake among LGBTQ+ youth highlight gaps in provider recommendations and HPV education ef - forts for sexual minority men and transgen- der women, despite high HPV incidence and prevalence among these groups.41 A study of transgender women in Chicago and Los An- geles found that young transgender women have particularly low HPV and HPV vaccine knowledge.42 Thus, effective public health campaigns should strongly consider the lo - cal target population and seek out multiple, culturally-specific strategies in improving vaccination uptake.43 CERVICAL CANCER DISPARITIES Examination of cervical cancer incidence and mortality rates reveal disparities among different communities and racial groups. Researchers have observed disparities in incidence of cervical cancer between urban and rural communities, with a higher rate of cervical cancer in rural communities. This could be a result of barriers to cervical can- cer prevention, detection, and treatment.44 There are also racial disparities in cervical can- cer incidence and mortality rates. Nationally, Latina women have the highest age-adjusted Health Disparities DISPARITIES IN HPV VACCINE KNOWLEDGE, ACCESS, & UPTAKE Unfortunately, HPV vaccine knowledge and uptake varies among race/ethnicity, gen- ders and sexual orientations. Studies have found that non-Hispanic Black and Hispanic individuals are less likely than non-Hispanic whites to have heard of HPV and the HPV vaccine, despite higher burden of cervical cancer in these communities.35 Additional- ly, women are more likely than men to be aware of HPV and the HPV vaccine.36 Similar trends can be seen in local studies among parents. For example, a study of parents in Los Angeles County, California found that \"parents who were male, older, less educated, Asian/Pacific Islander, and had sons remained signifi- cantly less aware\" of HPV vaccination.37 In another study, parents of uninsured children, parents with lower incomes, parents whose primary language was not English, and parents born outside of the United States were also less likely to have heard of HPV vaccines.38 While many studies have shown knowledge and access to lead to increased uptake, these may not suffice in all communities. For example, a study based in Los Angeles County found that even when HPV vaccine 10grades with the intended age range based on national recommendations. The vaccines are paid for by the government. Australia has observed higher uptake rates with this method than with other strategies, such as making the vaccine mandatory for school entry or vaccination through an individual's general practitioner.51 School-based vac - cination programs in Spain, Scotland, and Switzerland achieved completion rates of 77.3%, 81.0%, and 61.4%, respectively.52 Internationally, school- based vaccination programs have proven to be particularly successful in increasing rates of HPV vaccine uptake. Developing countries with school-based programs also have high vaccination rates. Program for Appropriate Technology in Health, a nonprofit global health organiza- tion, partnered with the governments of four countries to provide the HPV vaccine free at schools and clinics. This program led to high completion rates in India (87.8%), Peru (82.6%), Uganda (88.9%), and Vietnam (98.6%).53 School-Based Vaccination Programs in the United States School based vaccination programs decrease barriers to access by partnering with health care providers to provide vaccinations during school hours on school campuses. The ACIP includes school-based vaccination programs under recommendations in the General Best Practice Guidelines for Immunization.54 incidence rate per 100,000 women (9) of cer - vical cancer compared with Black (8), white (7), Asian/Pacific Islander (6), and American Indian/Alaska Native (6) women.45 Despite having higher rates of recent Pap testing to screen for cervical cancer (75% of Black women compared to 69% of white women), Black women have the highest mortality rate associated with the disease.46 A recent study showed that the 2000-2012 mortality rate for Black women in the Unit - ed States was 5.4 women per 100,000, while the mortality rate for white women was 2.4 per 100,000.47 Systemic racism and its im- pact on treatment access, continuity of care, and patient-provider relationships is likely to account for some of the disproportionate impact of cervical cancer on Black women.48 International Trends Approximately 99 countries and territories have introduced HPV vaccination programs in the last 10 years.49 With varying rates of success in increasing uptake of the HPV vaccination, a look into international trends can help inform stakeholders looking to increase uptake of the HPV vaccination in their jurisdictions. SCHOOL-BASED VACCINATION PROGRAMS Internationally, school-based vaccination programs have proven to be particularly successful in increasing rates of HPV vaccine uptake.50 These programs provide vaccine access to diverse populations, regardless of individual access to healthcare. Austral- ia, for example, has a robust school-based vaccination program that sends local teams of trained providers to schools and targets 11 HPV VACCINE POLICY LANDSCAPE : Public Health StrategiesStudies in Denver and Seattle suggest that use of SBHCs may increase uptake of the HPV vaccine. SBHCs in Denver were used to administer the first dose of the HPV vaccine, and a study found the program effectively increased uptake of the vaccine.62 A study of SBHCs in Seattle found that female SBHC users had 37% higher odds of completing the series at any time compared with SBHC nonusers, and male SBHC users had 45% higher odds of completing the series at any time compared with SBHC nonusers.63 These results suggest that SBHCs create a considerable opportunity to work with co-located schools to implement successful school based HPV vaccination programs. State Legislative Action One potential pathway to increasing rates of completion of the HPV vaccine is through legislative action. Out of the 18 states (in- cluding the District of Columbia) that have higher rates of uptake of the HPV vaccine than California,64 ten have passed some type of legislation related to the vaccine. Three have administrative or legislative mandates requiring vaccination for public school at - tendance, seven have provisions aimed at easing the cost of the HPV vaccine, and three have used legislation to establish programs that promote education on HPV, cervical cancer, and the HPV vaccine. This section will provide an overview of all state legislative action directed towards increasing uptake of the HPV vaccine, including what types of policies have been enacted, examples of leg- islative language used, and individual state case studies.School-based vaccination programs have been used to increase uptake of the hep - atitis B vaccine in places such as Denver, Colorado55 and Hawaii.56 In addition to being recommended by the ACIP, school-based vaccination programs are recommended by the Community Pre - ventive Services Task Force (CPSTF) \"based on strong evidence of effectiveness in in- creasing vaccination rates, and in decreas- ing rates of vaccine-preventable disease and associated morbidity and mortality.\"57 Because the HPV vaccine is recommended for all children at ages 11 or 12, targeting this age group through schools could increase HPV vaccine uptake. Studies in Texas and North Dakota both showed significant in- creases in rates of HPV vaccination comple - tion by using school based programs.58,59 This suggests that providing HPV vaccinations at school may be an effective pathway to increasing uptake, particularly in rural areas. SCHOOL-BASED HEALTH CENTERS Leveraging school-based health centers (SB- HCs) to provide the HPV vaccine to students attending co-located schools is also another promising way to increase vaccine uptake. In the United States, there are over 2000 SBHCs, ranging from fixed sites on school campuses to mobile health centers and telehealth.60 The services offered by these centers vary depending on the community health profes- sionals partnered with the centers. SBHCs offer enhanced access to health care, help reduce health care disparities among populations, and provide for better population health. California has approxi- mately 277 SBHCs.61 12TABLE 1 Summary of Up-To-Date HPV Vaccination Rates and Related Legislation Many of the 18 states with higher rates of HPV vaccine uptake than California have enacted legislation or regulations to support HPV vaccination.

Despite having liberal opt-out provisions, D.C. has achieved a rate of HPV vaccine up - take well above the national average, with 72.3% of adolescents age 13-17 up to date in 2020.69 Meanwhile, although Virginia's vaccine uptake among adolescent females exceeded the national average in 2020, a comparatively low uptake among adoles- cent males has caused the state's overall HPV vaccine uptake to fall below the nation- al average.70 OTHER STATE LEGISLATIVE ACTION Outside of a legislative or administrative mandate, HPV vaccine-related legislation largely falls into three categories: (1) edu- cation campaigns; (2) funding or coverage provisions; and (3) taskforce creation. Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Louisiana, Michigan, Missouri, New Jersey, North Carolina, South Carolina, Texas, Virginia, Washington, and the District of Columbia have all passed laws OVERVIEW OF MANDATES Four jurisdictions currently require the HPV vaccine for school attendance: Hawaii, Rho - de Island, Virginia, and the District of Colum- bia (D.C.). Of these four mandates, two are legislative (Virginia and D.C.), while Rhode Island and Hawaii both have administrative mandates, discussed later in this toolkit. In 2007, D.C. and Virginia, alongside 23 states introduced legislation to mandate the HPV vaccine for school-aged children.65 Virginia and D.C. were the only jurisdictions that suc - cessfully enacted school-based mandates that year. D.C. Code \u00a77-1651.04 (2007) pro - vides that \"the parent or legal guardian of a female child enrolling in grade 6 for the first time at a school in the District of Columbia shall be required to submit certification that the child had received the HPV vaccine,\" or certification that the child has not re - ceived the vaccine in compliance with one of the three legislative exceptions. The D.C. mandate allows children to be exempted if the vaccination would violate their or their parents' religious belief, the child's physician has certified that the vaccine is medically inadvisable for that child, or \"the parent or legal guardian, at his or her discretion, has elected to opt out of the HPV vaccination program, for any reason . . .\"66 Although the initial mandate only applied to female stu- dents, \u00a7 7-1651.04(a)(3) (2007) extends \"the HPV vaccination program requirements to males, consistent with standards set forth by the CDC.\"67 When the CDC expanded HPV vaccine recommendations to include males at age 11 or 12, the D.C. mandate extended to males as well. Virginia Code \u00a7 32.1-46(A)(12) mandates three doses of the HPV vaccine for females, 15 HPV VACCINE POLICY LANDSCAPE : Public Health Strategiesall passed laws aimed at easing the cost of the HPV vaccine, either by providing state funding or mandating that insurers cover the cost of the vaccine.72 Colorado, Illinois, Indiana, North Dakota, Texas, and the District of Columbia have all passed laws creating taskforces, commit - tees, or studies to create recommendations for the HPV vaccine.73promoting education on the HPV vaccine, including measures such as mandates that schools distribute information on the HPV vaccine to parents and children and creation of state-funded awareness campaigns.71 Alaska, Colorado, Illinois, Louisiana, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Mississippi, Ne - vada, New Hampshire, New Mexico, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, and West Virginia have Figure 4 United States Map of Enacted HPV-Related Mandates and Legislation Legislation is one promising pathway to support increased HPV vaccine uptake. Many states have enacted legislation related to the funding, study, or education of patients related to the HPV vaccine, while relatively few have more stringent mandates. Legend States and Territories with HPV Vaccine Mandate States with other enacted HPV Legislation States with bothD.C.RI16State Administrative Action Rather than pursuing legislative or execu- tive action, Rhode Island and Hawaii have targeted HPV through administrative ac - tion. Rhode Island used legislation to vest power in the Director of Health to promul- gate immunization regulations. Pursuant to these laws, 216-RICR-30-05-3.5.2 requires the HPV vaccine for all school age children. Hawaii's mandate for all students in grades seven through twelve to receive the vaccine is similarly promulgated through an admin- istrative rule from the state Department of Health and Human Services.79 Notably, both the Rhode Island regulation and the Hawaii administrative rule offer fewer exemption categories than the D.C. and Virginia legisla- tive mandates. They allow exemptions only for religious objection or proof from a med- ical professional that the student should be exempt for medical reasons, limiting the extent to which parents and guardians are permitted to refuse the vaccine on their child's behalf. In California, executive action has been used to successfully require and recommend a number of vaccinations for college entry.State Executive Action Another possible pathway to increase rates of completion of the HPV vaccine is through state-level executive action. In 2007, the year after the HPV vaccine was first recommended by the ACIP for girls be - tween the ages of 11 and 12,74 Governor Rick Perry of Texas issued Executive Order RP65 mandating the vaccine for females prior to admission to the sixth grade.75 The executive order was overturned within months by the Texas House of Representatives through a vote of 118 to 23.76 Although Governor Perry defended his position initially, he revised his stance during his presidential campaign in 2011, highlighting the politicized treatment of the HPV vaccine.77 Since Governor Perry's executive order was overturned in 2007, no other state executive has pursued an increase in HPV vaccine uptake through executive action. Generally, however, state executive action has been used to promote vaccination requirements. For example, in California, executive action has been used to success- fully require and recommend a number of vaccinations for college entry. In 2019, Exec - utive Order 803 updated the immunization requirements for attendance at California State University campuses; the Executive Order tracked the California Department of Health's list of vaccines that should be required, which does not currently include HPV.78 17 HPV VACCINE POLICY LANDSCAPE : Public Health StrategiesOther Points of Access: Pharmacists and Dentists Another potential pathway to increasing up - take of the HPV vaccine is to increase points of access to receive the vaccine. This method may be particularly useful in reaching rural populations, where access to physicians may be limited. Currently, 22 states allow pharmacists to give HPV vaccines to patients between the age of 11 and 12, but nine of those states require a patient-specific prescription.83 Cal- ifornia is one of only two states, along with Idaho, that allows pharmacists to administer the HPV vaccine without a prescription or standing order.84 One method of increasing uptake would be to promote vaccination at pharmacies, though administrative bur - dens of participating in specific vaccination programs may be a barrier for interested pharmacies. Dental offices present another potential point of access with both the tools to admin- ister vaccines and an interest in protecting patient populations from HPV and associ- ated cancers. In 2018, the American Dental Association adopted a policy that urged dentists to support the use and adminis- tration of the HPV vaccine in response to growing rates of HPV-related oropharyngeal cancers.85 In 2019, Oregon passed a law that added the prescription and administration of vaccines into a dentist's scope of practice, becoming the first state to do so.86Practitioner Focus Communication between healthcare pro - viders and patients is one of the strongest predictors of HPV vaccination.80 One prom- ising approach to increase uptake of the HPV vaccine is to focus on provider-patient interactions and to give providers the best tools to educate their patients on the HPV vaccine. Conversations between medical professionals and patients or patients' par - ents and guardians can help emphasize the importance of the HPV vaccine as a cancer prevention tool. This may serve to combat the stigma brought on by the HPV vaccine's historical association with sexually transmit - ted disease. To aid providers in navigating these interac - tions, the CDC published \"Top 10 Tips for HPV Vaccination Success.\"81 Among these tips for providers, the CDC recommends bundling the HPV vaccine with other vaccination recommendations, and emphasizing vacci- nation against HPV-related cancers \u2014 not just HPV. Another useful resource for healthcare pro - viders counseling patients and parents on the HPV vaccine is the \"HPV Vaccine Myth Busting for Health Care Providers Social Me - dia Toolkit,\" published by the George Wash- ington University Cancer Center. This toolkit offers providers tips on social media usage to promote awareness of the HPV vaccine and best practices for provider communica- tion about the HPV vaccine.8218 Many states have focused on provider outreach in order to increase vaccination rates in their states. For example, the District of Columbia (which has one of the highest vaccine rates in the country despite having one of the least restrictive mandates) has utilized trainings and conferences to ensure providers give strong recommendations for the HPV vaccine.87 In Massachusetts, state officials have a strong and collaborative partnership with the Massachusetts Chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics (MCAAP). The MCAAP has a Vaccination Initiative that provides resources for providers, patients, and parents on HPV and other childhood vaccines, with a current emphasis on vaccine catch-up programs.88Figure 5 Spotlight on the States MASSACHUSETTS Vaccination Initiative and catch up programs that provide resources to providers, patients, and parents WASHINGTON D.C. Utilizes trainings and conferences to ensure providers give strong recommendations for the HPV vaccine19 HPV VACCINE POLICY LANDSCAPE : Public Health StrategiesA 2012 study looked into the feasibility of a \"catch up\" vaccination program for college students and found that knowledge of the vaccine was moderate, and especially weak regarding its use as a cancer-prevention tool.90 The same study found that 71% of stu- dent participants were eligible and willing to receive school-based HPV vaccines at col- lege. These data are encouraging and show that a college-based vaccination program could be very beneficial. COVID-19 In October 2021, California signaled its intent to require COVID-19 vaccination for public school attendance once the FDA has fully approved the vaccines for children.91 While it remains to be seen how the state intends to enact the requirement, its chosen levers may be instructive for HPV vaccine path- ways in California. Both Louisiana and the District of Columbia have announced similar requirements pending FDA approval.92 The CDC has warned that disruptions to childhood vaccination schedules as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic may create sig- nificant risks of vaccine-preventable disease outbreaks among children and adolescents as schools resume in-person learning.93 Al- though pediatric vaccination has returned to pre-pandemic levels in recent months, the increase remains insufficient to account for its steep decline in early 2020.94 As re - covery from COVID-19 continues, states will have to contend both with the delays in care and the pervasive vaccine hesitancy that the pandemic has left in its wake.Allowing pharmacists and dentists to ad- minister the HPV vaccine could increase rates of uptake of the vaccine by reducing the barriers to access. Patients who visit a general practitioner infrequently may have more regular contact with a dentist or pharmacist. Furthermore, for patients and their guardians who may be resistant to the vaccine as a result of its association with sexually-transmitted disease, conver - sations with a dentist regarding the risk of oropharyngeal cancer may serve to under - line the importance of the HPV vaccine as a cancer prevention tool. Targeting the College Population With vaccination rates for target populations lower than desired by many health profession- als, targeting college-age students presents an opportunity to impact total rates of HPV vaccine uptake and prevent HPV-related can- cers.89 Although vaccination is recommended at the age of 11 or 12 and the vaccine is most effective when administered before any sex - ual activity, vaccination is still recommended for everyone up to age 26 because there are multiple strains of HPV to protect against. Targeting college-age students presents an opportunity to impact total rates of HPV vaccine uptake and prevent HPV-related cancers. 20will require coordinated, multi-pronged ap - proaches that give careful consideration to the needs and context of target populations. State policy-makers, educational institu- tions, and healthcare providers of all kinds have important roles to play in promoting uptake and improving health outcomes. It is our hope that this resource may serve as a tool in occupying those roles effectively.Conclusion Despite the HPV vaccine's proven efficacy at reducing rates of HPV and associated cancers, uptake remains low across the United States. Low demand, inadequate provider recommendations, limited indi- vidual awareness, financial concerns, and sexuality-related stigma have all contribut - ed to this problem. Faced with an array of challenges, no one policy pathway will be the solution: increasing HPV vaccine uptake 21 HPV VACCINE POLICY LANDSCAPE : Public Health Strategies 21Resource Library President's Cancer Panel, HPV Vaccination for Cancer Prevention: Progress, Opportuni- ties, and a Renewed Call to Action, https://prescancerpanel.cancer.gov/report/hpvupdate/ In 2018, the President's Cancer Panel published a report designed to provide an overview of progress made with the HPV vaccine in the preceding five years and to identify strategies to increase uptake of the HPV vaccine. This resource includes information on efforts related to the HPV Vaccine and sets four new goals moving forward. California HPV Vaccination Roundtable , https://cahpvroundtable.org/ The California HPV Vaccination is a statewide coalition of various stakeholders, including members that represent immunization, cancer control, academia, community organizations, state and local agencies, among others, who work together to prevent HPV-associated can- cers and pre-cancers by increasing the HPV vaccination among the recommended age group. HPV Vaccination Project, Maine Area Health Education Center, https://www.une.edu/ ahec/hpv-vaccination-project The Maine Area Health Education Center received funding from the CDC to provide continu- ing education to health professionals about the HPV vaccine. This resource includes Clinician FAQs, recommendations for improving general practice related to the HPV Vaccine, HPV Fact Sheets, and documents with tips on how to talk to parents. HPV Campus Vaccination Campaign, https://www.hpv-cvc.org/ This resource provides downloadable visual messaging tools, including patient brochures, bulletin boards, slide sets, and pre-visit patient questionnaires that providers can use to increase uptake ovf the HPV vaccine. Mission: HPV Cancer Free, American Cancer Society, https://www.cancer.org/healthy/ hpv-vaccine.html This resource focuses on the HPV vaccine as a cancer-prevention tool and includes downloadable info graphs highlighting the importance of the HPV vaccine in the fight against cancer. National HPV Vaccination Roundtable, https://hpvroundtable.org/ The National HPV Vaccination Roundtable is a coalition of organizations across the country that work at the intersection of immunization and cancer prevention. \"We Need Access\": Ending Preventable Deaths from Cervical Cancer in Rural Georgia, Human Rights Watch and Southern Rural Black Women's Initiative for Economic and Social Justice, https://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/media_2022/01/us_cervicalcan - cer0122_web.pdf This resource documents racial disparity in access comprehensive cervical cancer treatment and makes recommendations for how state and federal policies can better address the healthcare needs of rural Black women. 22There are many different paths available to stakeholders looking to increase completion rates of the HPV vaccine in California. Different states, countries, and advocacy groups have increased uptake of the vaccine through legislative action, regulatory action, school-based vaccination programs, and aiding providers in their direct-to-patient outreach. Based on Cali- fornia's specific barriers and opportunities, this toolkit recommends four key pathways:Appendix A A Review of Pathways for California Current California Public University Immunization Requirements California has two public university systems: California State University (CSU) and the University of California (UC), which require a number of vaccinations, both by statute and through the California Department of Public Health (CDPH). CSU, with 23 campuses, requires that incoming students are vaccinated for hepatitis B (HBV) in accordance with the California Health and Safety Code.95 The University of California, with 10 campuses, is exempted from the mandate unless the Regents of the University of California expressly adopt the provision, and they have not.96 CSU has a series of required immunizations beyond the statutorily mandated HBV and meningococcal vaccines. In March of 2019, Executive Order 803 (EO) was issued on immunization requirements for CSU campuses, which are based on CDPH's immunization and screening recommendations for college students.97 HPV is not required by this order, but is listed under recommend- ed immunizations and screenings for people through age 26.98 This designa- tion means that students are \"strongly encouraged\" to obtain the service and that students are directed to discuss the service with a health care provider. UC campuses, although not covered by the EO, also elect to follow CDPH recommendations.99 The current UC Immunization Policy requires incoming students to obtain the vaccinations recommended by CDPH for those diseases that can be passed on to others by respiratory transmission.100 All UC campuses require HBV, TB, measles, pertussis.101 Like CSU, UC also strongly recommends the HPV vaccine but does not require it.10223 HPV VACCINE POLICY LANDSCAPE : Public Health Strategiesvaccine uptake in rural communities. An- other opportunity to increase access to the HPV vaccine would be to pass legislation or promulgate regulations allowing dentists to administer the HPV vaccine. PROVIDER OUTREACH A low-cost pathway to increasing uptake of the HPV vaccine in California would be to increase resources and support for provider direct-to-patient outreach. As stated in this toolkit, communication between healthcare providers and patients is one of the strong- est predictors of HPV vaccination.106 Effective provider-patient communication is likely to prove complementary to any chosen policy pathway. SCHOOL-BASED VACCINATION PROGRAMS School-based vaccination programs have seen great success in other countries and in pilot programs, like the SBHCs in Denver, in increasing uptake of the HPV vaccine. Not only are these programs demonstrably successful and recommended by the ACIP, but they also help to address disparities among populations that arise from a lack of access to healthcare. Disparities in cervical cancer among racial groups and between rural and urban populations have been observed. Widespread school-based vacci- nation programs aimed at increasing access and uptake of the HPV vaccine could not only help prevent cancer, but also combat these disparities. CDPH ACTION Although the HPV vaccine is recommended as young as 11, the CDC recommends the vaccine through the age of 26 (with shared clinical decision-making for people aged 27 to 45 years).103 College students may have al- ready been exposed to some strains of HPV, but because there are many strains of HPV the vaccine can still be a helpful cancer pre - vention tool for that population. Targeting college students is a step in the right direc - tion in order to increase rates of completion for the population as a whole. Because CSU is mandated to follow CDPH recommendations and UC has elected to follow the current UC Immunization Policy, one key pathway to increase uptake of the HPV vaccine in California would be for CDPH to update its current recommendations to reflect the ACIP's recommendations and include the HPV vaccine. LEGISLATIVE OR REGULATORY MANDATE State law can mandate, or state agencies may regulate, receipt of the HPV vaccine for school entry. Of the four jurisdictions that have such mandates, three are in the top five states for rates of up-to-date vaccination of the HPV vaccine.104 INCREASED ACCESS POINTS California already allows pharmacists to administer the HPV vaccine; however, many do not do so.105 Investigating barriers to pharmacists administering the vaccine may be instructive, particularly for increasing 24The following table represents data collected and analyzed by the California HPV Vaccination Roundtable's Using and Improving HPV Vaccination Data Workgroup (Data Workgroup). The Data Workgroup used base data from the California Cancer Registry (CCR). To address data suppression in smaller counties, county groupings were used where there were fewer than 11 total HPV-attributable cases.107 Appendix B California Age-Adjusted Rate of HPV- Attributable Cancers by County Credit: Assessment of Human Papillomavirus (HPV) Attributable Cancers and Vaccination Rates in California, California HPV Vaccination Roundtable (2020).CountyAge-adjusted rate of HPV-attributable cancers (per 100,000) All California 8.6 Alameda 7.5 Alpine, Amador, and Calaveras 9.8 Butte 10.9 Colusa, Glenn, Tehama 11.9 Contra Costa 7.8 Del Norte, Humboldt 11.2 El Dorado 9.6 Fresno 8 Imperial 7.7 Inyo, Mono 9.2 Kern 9.4 Kings 9.7 Lake 11.5 Lassen, Modoc, Plumas 10.2 Los Angeles 8.2 Madera 8.6 Marin 10.4 Mariposa, Tuolumne 9.8 Mendocino 9.8 Merced 8.2 Monterey 8.5 Napa 10.3 Nevada 7.8CountyAge-adjusted rate of HPV-attributable cancers (per 100,000) Orange 8.1 Placer 9.7 Riverside 9.8 Sacramento 10.2 San Benito 9.6 San Bernardino 9.3 San Diego 9.2 San Francisco 9 San Joaquin 9.2 San Luis Obispo 9 San Mateo 7.1 Santa Barbara 8.5 Santa Clara 6.2 Santa Cruz 9.5 Shasta 11.5 Sierra, Yuba 8.9 Siskiyou, Trinity 10 Solano 8.5 Sonoma 9.9 Stanislaus 8.7 Sutter 9.4 Tulare 10.4 Ventura 8.9 Yolo 8.325 HPV VACCINE POLICY LANDSCAPE : Public Health StrategiesThe following table ranks states by up-to-date HPV vaccination rates among adolescents aged 13-17 years in 2020 based on data collected by the National Immunization Survey.108 Participants are considered up-to-date when they have received the recommended doses of the HPV vaccine, either two doses if they received the vaccine before they were 15 or three doses if they receive the vaccine after the age of 15.Appendix C Rate of Up-to-Date HPV Vaccination by State JurisdictionRate of Up- 2 Hawaii 73.9 73.4 67.6-78.5 4 District of Columbia 72.3 65.1-78.5 5 South Dakota 71.5 65.4-76.9 6 Vermont 70.5 64.5-75.8 7 North Dakota 70.3 64.0-76.0 8 Minnesota 69.2 62.5-75.1 9 New Hampshire 68.8 63.1-73.9 10 New York 63.5-72.4 11 Pennsylvania 67.1 61.2-72.5 12 Connecticut 66.9 60.5-72.7 13 Maryland 66.8 61.9-71.3 14 Colorado 66.4 59.9-72.4 15 Nebraska 64.8 58.9-70.3 16 Wisconsin 61.5 Michigan 61.3 55.1-67.2 23 North Carolina 60.7 53.4-67.5 24 Louisiana 60.4 25 Iowa 60.3 53.4-66.8JurisdictionRate of Up- to-date HPV Vaccination95% Confidence Interval 26 New Jersey 59.7 New Mexico 59.2 53.0-65.1 28 Washington 29 Virginia 56.4 50.0-62.5 30 Kentucky 55.7 48.3-62.9 31 Alaska 54.9 47.8-61.8 32 Georgia 54.9 47.7-62.0 33 Texas 54.9 49.9-59.9 34 Idaho 54.5 47.9-61.0 35 Montana 54.4 47.6-61.0 36 Missouri 53.6 46.9-60.1 37 Kansas 53.3 46.9-59.6 39 Ohio 53.2 46.4-59.8 40 Alabama 52.9 46.3-59.4 41 Tennessee 52.9 46.3-59.4 42 Florida 51.6 44.4-58.7 43 Arizona 51.4 45.0-57.7 44 Nevada 50.1 43.4-56.8 45 Arkansas 49.6 42.6-56.5 46 South Carolina 47 Oklahoma 45.8 Virginia 43.4 37.1-49.8 51 Mississippi 31.9 25.9-38.5 * Adolescents (N = 20,163) in the 2020 NIS-Teen were born January 2002 through February 2008.26ENDNOTES 1.
