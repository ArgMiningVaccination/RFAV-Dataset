Front Public Health ; humoral in some [patients]with [autoimmune [safety]and immunogenicity of inactivated in RA analyzed. Methods:Seventy five RA [patients]and 26 healthy controls (HC) were respectively recruited from Yunnan Provincial [Hospital]of [Traditional Chinese Medicine]and the [community]in Kunming city. [Neutralizing Antibody](NAb) Test ELISA kit was used to [measure]the percentage of inhibition. AKA of [neutrophils]) and [LYMPH]% (percentage of percentage) were calculated by a calculation [method]. Results:Compared with the HC group, the percentage of inhibition was significantly lower in RA [patients]receiving two doses of [vaccines]. [Vaccines]-induced percentage of inhibition was the lowest in RA [patients] [who]had not been vaccinated. In total 80.77% of the HC group had a percentage of inhibition \u00e2\u00a720%, compared with 45.24% of vaccinated RA [patients]and correlation responses]to [SARS-CoV-2]did not differ between RA [patients]according to their age and [disease]duration. Furthermore, the results showed that no correlation was found between the percentage of inhibition and indices for RA, including [healthy importance of a third ... LILACS LIS "}
