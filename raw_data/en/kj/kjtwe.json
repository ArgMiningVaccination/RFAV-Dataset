These lamps have hygroscopic properties and readily absorb moisture out of the air. The natural color of a salt lamp creates an orange or pinkish glow that can add beauty to any decor. Himalayan salt lamps make a great addition for any space: in your bedroom, at the office, by your computer, next to your television, or anywhere else you want to brighten a space with a beautiful glow. For maximum benefits, we recommend leaving your lamp on as much as possible. Care For Your Salt Lamp: Salt lamps have hygroscopic properties and readily absorb moisture out of the atmosphere. To dust your salt lamp, simply wipe with a damp cloth. Salt lamps may sweat with excessive humidity. If moisture begins to collect on the surface of your salt lamp, turn it off and wipe it down with a cloth. Please keep a dish or coaster under the salt lamp to protect delicate surfaces. For indoor use only. We suggest using a 15-watt clear bulb in our salt lamps. Note: Evolution Salt Co's salt lamps are handcrafted making each piece unique. Color and shape may vary. "}
