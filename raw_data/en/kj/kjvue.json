Introduction Why It's Important to be a Healthy Gaian We are all Gaians. We've all heard the name Gaia by now, maybe through Greek mythology, James Lovelock's Gaia Hypothesis, or possibly some new-age flavored goddess-based references. Gaia, we are told, is the Spirit of the Earth, the planet's goddess. She's known by other names too, such as Changing Woman, White Shell Woman, Bhudevi, Tellus Mater, Terra Mater, Geb, First Mother, Nerthus, and Blodeuwedd. While many have heard the name, probably very few genuinely believe this is a true thing. We assume it's a respectful metaphor from the past, but a metaphor only. But clairvoyants who have viewed the Earth attest to Gaia's existence, that she is an actual spiritual being who superintends the entire Earth and not a metaphor. We get some lateral confirmation of this perception from the Vedic astronomers of India. This system assigns spiritual beings to each of the planets in our solar system. Brihaspati is the spirit of Jupiter; Shukra of Venus, Mangala of Mars, and Sanischara of Saturn. The Greeks of course named the planets after the gods assigned to them, as in Venus, Mars, and Saturn, but we are so familiar with this we no longer believe it describes something real. But in the Vedic view the qualities and activities assigned to the planet Jupiter by astrologers are not due to the physical planet, but to its attendant spirit, Brihaspati. They seemed to have conceived of this as a kind of planetary archangel. The Vedic astrologers, who, incidentally, were clairvoyant too and originally spoke from observation rather than received dogma, said that Brihaspati is a great teacher of spiritual truths, a benefactor providing protection, prosperity and benediction; they said that his energy is fundamentally about expansion and growth based on wisdom. That's about the same case Western astrologers make for Jupiter but they eliminate the middle-man and say it's the only the planet. Perhaps that is simplistic. The Vedic implication is that these planetary superintendents, or egregors, are a kind of cosmic spirit-being each the size of their respective planetary bodies whose job is to not only look after the planet and its residents but to be its resident soul, to ensoul it. And Earth? The Vedic seers called the Spirit of Earth Bhudevi, which translates as the Goddess Who Is the Earth. They even offer a story from long ago about a time when she complained to Vishnu, the Hindu equivalent of the Christ, that she was being overrun by demons; Vishnu benevolently intervened and purified Bhudevi of the bad breed who were devastating her planetary body. The Navajo of the American Southwest say Changing Woman (their name for Gaia) was born on Giant-Spruce Mountain, Ch'ool'i'i, now known as Gobernador Knob in New Mexico. She first appeared over the peak as an unusual white cloud then settled and congealed into a woman. She called herself Asdz\u00e1\u00e1 N\u00e1dleeh\u00e9, Changing Woman. My purpose here is not to prove the existence of an Earth Spirit called Gaia. Whether we take Gaia as a serviceable metaphor for a planetary mechanism or as a clairvoyantly revealed spiritual being who superintends our planet, the fact remains that we are all Gaians. If we lived on Jupiter, we might look out at the bluewhite planet we know as Earth and say, The people there are Gaians; they live on Gaia. And they might recount the spiritual qualities and functions assigned to Gaia and her planet, just as astrologers attribute qualities to the spirits of the solar system planets. As Jupiterians, it would be obvious to us, implicit in our cultural weave, that the planet Gaia has a master ensouling spiritual being, and stories would be told about her. On Jupiter, we would not see the Earth in terms of its many polities, a lot of them in conflict today, but as a single being in the solar system. We're not quite there yet. The Jupiterian view of Gaia is still foreign or unreal to many on Earth. It's like the way C.S. Lewis saw it in his novel, Out of the Silent Planet. The silent planet was Earth, and people on Venus wondered why they hadn't heard anything from us. Yet we are starting to get this idea ourselves now, amidst our separate nationalities and landscapes, although we are tending to get the Gaian perspective from a negative slant, from seeing the damage we have done and continue to do to our host planet. This book is not autobiographical in any way, but it has an autobiographical root. I have been happily interacting with the Spirit of the Earth and the planet's array of sacred sites since 1984 when I was first introduced to the pattern. I have seen Gaia, said Hello! to her, and know she exists. I might have gotten there by logic and inference too, following the insinuations of Vedic astrology, but I was fortunate to see her directly and that dissolved my doubts instantly. Since the early 1970s, I have also been looking after my health in terms of food, diet, exercise, and choice of medical therapies when they were required. It wasn't that I was on a mission as a health evangelist; I just didn't like being sick and preferred feeling well. The few times I consulted conventional doctors, I usually ended up sicker or at least uncured. Probably it was a Baby Boomer thing to take up health with passion and zeal. I studied it, practiced it, wrote about it, and lived it because it was more fun being healthy than sick. For a while, everyone I knew was doing the same thing. I couldn't believe how many diets there were, how many practices and teachers, but no matter: the intent was wholesome\u2014let's stay healthy, and why not let's even get healthier. To be healthy rather than sick has planetary implications. Please indulge me a clich\u00e9: we are very much behind the curve in our planetary duties. Duties? One of the consequences of our planet having a residential spiritual being as superintendent is that there are multiple ways and avenues for our interaction with her. Native peoples have always known this and marked off sanctuaries within their respective landscape as locales dedicated for ritualized and regular interaction with Her. We tend to call such places sacred sites, holy places, vortexes, or pilgrimage destinations. In the West now, and especially in the United States, we are starting to like sacred sites, be intrigued by the idea of holy places, and often visit them even if we don't always know what to do when we get there or what the old rituals really meant and how to use them again. I call the planetary array of sacred sites Earth's visionary geography. It's a kind of intermediate zone between Earth and Heaven, to use the classical terms. It's the place designated for our interactions with the Spirit of the Earth. Why? Because Gaia, or whatever name we prefer to use, needs human input; it's a kind of spiritual food for her. And we need the regular contact with her for that is also a spiritual nutrient. This interactive feedback loop\u2014pun intended\u2014keeps humans and planet aligned with something bigger, namely, the solar system, galaxy, and spiritual worlds, again something native and traditional peoples have always known and honored. Why should we care about some spiritual nutrient that comes from the planet? Because its intent is to keep us healthy by being aligned with our spiritual sources. What sources? The sources that when we reconnect with them we get answers to questions like: why are we here, why is there an Earth, why do we have bodies, what's the point of it all, and how long's it going to last? How many of us have solid, reliable, unwobbling answers to these questions? We may have hunches, notions, suspicions. But when we are healthy Gaians we know, in body, mind, emotions, spirit, and culture. Healthy means well-being in our body, mind, emotions, spirit, and culture. Arguably, we have little of that in the world today, even in medicine-dominated America. We may have longevity but not well-being; many treatments but not health. I mentioned we are behind the curve. Since for the most part as a culture we are not interacting with the planet and its host goddess, we are out of the health loop it affords. A certain amount of entropy has entered the picture, and we have grown accustomed to a type of chronic ill-health of body, mind, emotion, and spirit. This disinclines us even to regard the Earth as our host context, other than from a state of worry, anxiety, and fear that we might be grievously damaging our ecosystem. Yes, that's a start, even if from a deficit and fueled by fear, but we have a ways to go to get back into the positive health feedback loop and mouth-fed human-Earth dialogue. I say mouth-fed for a reason: ever give a dog or cat something delicious from your hand? Ever get licks, purrs, and tail-wags back? It could be like that with the Earth and us. We give the old girl light and attention, she gives us light and attention. The set-up is that we will stay healthy through interacting with the Earth. The present reality is that we are chronically ill at different levels of our constitution from not doing this and our ill health actually disinclines us from even considering the idea. Let's work the syllogism forward now. As we start to reclaim our health from all the places we lost it, in the realms of the body, mind, emotions, spirit, and culture, we start to free ourselves from all the energies, ideas, and restrictions that keep us from identifying ourselves as Gaians, from becoming aware of our planetary context. Many people now suggest it's time we start thinking of ourselves as planetary citizens. Forget the American, French, and Russian identities; those are parochial: we're Gaians now, and always have been, though it takes a while to get up to speed on this. Granted, some people interact with the Earth from whatever health status they enjoy, and this stiff upper lip approach is excellent. But we get even better results when we begin interacting with Gaia from a foundation of well-being. Gaia is a large spiritual being, and so is our planet, so effective interaction takes a lot of energy. That's why it's important we have a strong foundation of good health before we start. I realized recently that since I left the field of health journalism to write about geomantic topics, the typical American lifestyle hadn't quite caught up with the tracks laid down by the Baby Boomers as we stormed through the 1980s and 1990s researching and implementing new ways to improve our health. Probably what startled me most was observing how many advertisements you see on commercial TV for drugs. It seems people are medicating themselves for everything, that dependency on prescription drugs is the preferred lifestyle for 21st century Americans. Ask your doctor about drug-X, a friendly TV voice intones. It's a great income for doctors and drug companies, but medicating for everything will not necessarily improve your health nor will it redirect your focus towards the planet. James Lovelock, the British atmospheric scientist who developed the Gaia Hypothesis in the late 1970s, which says the planet is a sin-gle, self-regulating superorganism, says we need planetary physicians. So ask your planetary doctor about the medicine Gaia needs. Don't worry about prescription drug co-pays on this one: we're the medicine! Healthy Gaians is an anthology of health articles I've written in the past 25 years. Most were published in magazines in the U.S., Europe, and Australia; a few were commissioned but never published; some were published in much shorter versions. There are many ways to better health, and none of the approaches I write about are offered to you as definitive programs, merely as suggestions. The important thing is to start getting healthy so you can help the planet in its time of need. Then the Earth can start sending back the good health vibrations to you in the health loop. The sequence of articles follows a thematic line, from the body to mind to spirit and out into the culture, presenting different ways of regaining our health. The book covers many topics, such as bodywork, cancer, the immune system, vaccinations, Jungian psychology, intuition, conflict resolution, healing with art, music, sound, and color, singing to the dying, dreams, water rejuvenation, the poetics of the elements, near-death experiences, the purpose of evil, myth-living, and shamanic adventures. I survey lots of natural health modalities such as herbalism, acupuncture, flower essences, and bionutrient fortification. I profile a stimulating group of health pioneers, such as R.D. Laing, William Irwin Thompson, Barbara Walker, Fred Alan Wolf, Caroline Myss, M.F.K. Fisher, Kyriacos Markides, and Rowena Kryder, among others. Maybe you've heard of some of these luminaries, and maybe not, but they have all showed us practical, innovative ways to free ourselves from the ill-health constraints of body, mind, and culture as part of the larger process of becoming healthy Gaians. They reveal some of the broader aspects of good health. As part of my work as a journalist, I met them, talked to them, and wrote up their stories. This book is the fifth in the series called Primers on Earth's Geomantic Reality. It's a primer because mostly it's a concentrated introduction to a complex subject. I bring in the Earth because the features are distributed across the globe so the entire planet is implicated in their reality and application. Geomantic is an old British term with different nuances; mine is that it is the discipline of figuring out Earth's energy patterns and how to use them. Reality means higher or deeper reality, something a bit beyond the comfort zone of our consensus reality yet very much a planetary truth. The purpose of the series is to show different ways we can interact beneficially with the planet through its many geoman-tic nodes designed just for that. I include Healthy Gaians in this series, even though it does not explain planetary structure, to emphasize the importance of optimal human health for the maintenance of the Earth. I also think it salutary to start linking human health with planetary well-being, seeing that the first is the stepping-stone to the second. When we are healthy enough in body and mind and have somewhat extricated ourselves from the sticky atheistic and materialistic webs that structure Western society, then we can bring the Earth into focus and realize, perhaps with a shock, that this is our master context for living and that human and planetary health are so intertwined, both need to be healthy at the same time for the continued well being of humans and good old Mother Earth. Part I BODY HEALING Naturmenschen at the Mountain of Truth Formative Moments in the Natural Healing Movement The well-remarked natural foods boom that started in the 1960s was not the first eruption of this emphasis in the 20th century. This article briefly recounts a bold experiment in the 1960's style of reality that actually started around 1900 in Switzerland, and it has all the familiar elements: the Kerouackian vagabonding, the permanent on-the-road condition of living and thinking, the alternative medicine and abundant sex, the emphasis on healthy foods and natural healing practices, and most importantly, the realization that healthy men and women are necessary for implementing significant cultural changes, a view that supports this book's thesis, that healthy people\u2014healthy Gaians\u2014are needed by the planet itself to help its healing and rebalancing and transition through the tumultuous changes underway. The seeds of our now much touted late 20th century new age may have been planted at a remote Swiss mountain village named Ascona in the first two decades of this century by a handful of young, disgruntled Europeans undertaking a bold experiment in communal revolt. Out at the border of Switzerland and Italy, on the verge of the Alps, at the north end of Lago Maggiore, stands Ascona and its foothills, including Monescia, the Mountain ofTruth, 300 meters high; and behind Monescia there tower Baladrume, Corona dei Pinci, and Gridone, climbing up to the snowpeaks. In 1900, Ascona was an inconsequential mountain village of one thousand residents who spoke Italian, observed Roman Catholicism, cultivated vineyards, lived frugally, enjoyed the mild climate, and probably ignored the numerous caves, unclaimed land, and abandoned houses in their midst. But for the small group of spiritual immigrants trekking across and away from industrialized Europe\u2014what sociologist Max Weber called the iron cage of discontent, refugees from efficient but dehumanizing bureaucratization, metropolitan values, and materialist modernism\u2014Ascona's rural impoverishment and modest blandishments were a sylvan godsend. They were the Naturmenschen, these dropouts from the urban bourgeois lifestyle, men and women sporting long hair, bare legs, sandals, and radical ideas. They refused to produce according to society's expectations; instead, their adventurous, iconoclastic, exemplary lives would be the works and products of their labor. The impeachment of patriarchal culture, Lebensreform, the veneration of Magna Mater, and the diviniza-tion of Nature\u2014these were the truths they sought to uphold at Monescia. They ascended Ascona espousing feminism, vegetarian diets, naturopathy, medical reform, pedagogical innovations, anarchism, eroticism, pacifism, pagan dance drama, Sun worship, vagabondage, and a new lifestyle of radical simplification under the tutelage of Eros. Among the seven who arrived, the two most practical in terms of leadership were Henri Oedenkoven, 25, from Belgium, and Ida Hoffman, 36, from Montenegro in the Balkans. Accompanying them were Jenny Hoffman, a musician, Gusto Graser, a craftsman, his brother Karl, an Austrian army lieutenant, Ferdinand Brune, a theosophist, and Lotte Hattemer, a Berlin bureaucrat's daughter. They were a constituency of the sensitive, as American scholar Martin Green says in his excellent survey of the Asconan experiment, Mountain of Truth\u2014The Counterculture Begins, Ascona, 1900-1920 (University Press of New England, 1986). All these people were trying to reroute the express of historical progress, or at least to chart new routes for it, writes Green. Oedenkoven, whose Belgian father was a wealthy industrialist, laid out 150,000 Swiss francs for three and one-half hectares on Monescia as his companions moved into the caves and ramshackle cabins; Ida Hoffman, announcing the establishment of a health sanitorium, renamed their new home for social experimentation, Monte Verita\u2014Der Berg der Wahrheit ( The Mountain of Truth). During their twenty-year residency Ascona would become an unofficial nexus and pilgrim's watering hole for Europe's cultural discontents. Inspired in part by Richard Wagner's essay Religion and Art (1880) and his operatic hero, the sandalled Tannhauser, the young Asconans identified with his call for a Bayreuthian league of mystical reformers who would use art and spirituality to regenerate a humanity deadened by materialism. Even before the arrival of Hoffman and Oedenkoven, Ascona's indigenous magnetism had drawn spiritual dissidents and political rebels including the Italian statesman Garibaldi, the Russian anarchist Bakunin; in 1889, Alfred Pioda proposed to found a theosophical educational community at Monescia; and by 1900, there was a scattering of Tolstoyan ascetics and Naturmenschen vegetarians flourishing in the vicinity. The period 1897\u20141907 is sometimes called the Tolstoy years because during this period the influence of Russian novelist Nikolai Tolstoy as a counterculturalpaterfamilias was unrivalled in Europe. In 1902, Hoffman and Oedenkoven opened the Monte Verita sanitarium and started treating patients with a repertoire of Nature cures. They knew that durable cultural reform must be founded on individuals with vital, radiant health, a desirable condition too often defeated by the unnatural medical and dietary conventions of modern society. The Nature cure already had considerable momentum and public support in the German-speaking countries ever since Bismarck had been cured of a presumed liver cancer in 1880 by a naturopathic physician named Schweninger in the wake of repeated failures by conventional allopathic doctors. Schweninger's therapeutic success was reinforced by the subsequent influential works of Adolf Just, Louis Kuhne, and Sebastian Kneipp, all of whom advocated cures drawn from Nature. Under Hoffman's direction, Monte Verita patients undertook nude sunbathing, mud poultices, cold baths, fasting, exposure to fresh air, sleeping outdoors, Vegetarismus! and Vegetabilismus!\u2014a purified, even ascetic, vegetarian diet with no meat, eggs, or dairy products\u2014as Hoffman outlined in a 1905 booklet. Around that time about 40 Naturmenschen were living at Monte Verita, the free-spirited young men in their Kurkleider, the women in their long, free-flowing hair; the local Asconans, shocked by the unorthodox sexual liaisons exhibited before them, called them vegetarian marriages. Ida Hoffman was also a staunch feminist, certainly a bolder, more challenging position for a European woman to undertake 90 years ago than today. The reform of life must include a recognition of the ubiquity of patriarchal attitudes embedded in social structures, a revaluation of gender roles, and a repudiation of traditional Christian marital values, argued Hoffman. At Monte Verita household chores and domestic tasks were apportioned equally among men and women. But the feminists espousing notable theories of matriarchal superiority as they were exemplary feminists striving to demonstrate the qualities of life worthy of the unoppressed woman who lived out-of-doors, socially unprotected, breaking as many of society's rules as possible. Their presence on the streets of Ascona announced the possibility of freedom for women, writes Green, and made Ascona a place to which women came to be free. In addition to advocating Nature cures, vegetarian lifestyles, and feminism, the Asconan Lebensreformers explored new vistas in dance, psychotherapy, Theosophic occultism, and the anarchic values of vagabunden. In 1913, the noted dance innovator Rudolf Laban opened his Schule f\u00fcr Lebenskunst at Monte Verita where he taught music and speech as ingredients for an expanded vision of dance expression; he emphasized wild spontaneity, feminist values, individualistic exaltation, even dance forms liberated from music and formal choreography. Laban, whom contemporaries recalled as a kind of bearded, Dionysiac satyr and a magician of dance, called his approach life-body-gesture movement, and it was a dissonant performance innovation that fused thought, feeling, and will, that would influence German dance culture for decades. Then there was that quintessential bad boy and counterculture hero of Ascona, Otto Gross. The painful dialectic between Otto and his father, Hans\u2014ein Bartige, as the Asconans deroga-torily called him, a prominent law professor, the creator of scientific crime detection, and the archetype of 19th century suppressive German fatherhood\u2014was synecdochal for the Asconan revolt against the Bismarckian iron cage and its mostly male upholders. Not surprisingly, Otto Gross rebelled unilaterally against all the values of his father's generation, advocating anarchistic politics and, allegedly, orgiastic psychotherapy. In 1909, Sigmund Freud declared Gross' ideas dangerous, anathematic to the psychoanalytic movement; but in the previous year C.G. Jung, himself a Freudian apostate, had undertaken a depth analysis of Gross until the latter broke it off. Eventually, Hans Gross arranged for his intellectually unruly son's imprisonment as a dangerous psychopath on dubious charges and though Otto died in 1920 at age 43, his ideological fanaticism and antipsychiatry fulminations inspired many. For Ernest Jones, Freud's student and biographer, Gross was the nearest approach to the romantic idea of a genius I have ever met. Life on the Mountain of Truth where cultural conventions were routinely overthrown involved a deepening of philosophical and metaphysical inquiry. Interest in occultism and Theosophy blossomed on the hill. Theodore Reuss held summer congresses for his esoteric Ordo Templi Orientis (OTO) at Ascona (even founding an OTO branch there called Verita Mystica), during which Monte Verita residents recited poems of Aleister Crowley, the flamboyant Qabalist. In nearby Locarno a Freemason's lodge flourished alongside students of Rudolf Steiner's Anthroposophy; there were palm readings, tea-leaf divinations, Ouija-board seances, spiritualist circles, and various other hermetic and sexual magic practices. Another Asconan stalwart, Gusto Graser, heroically exemplified the open-ended exploratory spirit of vagabunden, an unfettered peripatetic lifestyle of being permanently on the road, constantly moving, rootlessly wandering, sleeping outdoors, never succumbing to bourgeois creature comforts, fixed views, or steady employment, to life inside the iron cage. Long after Monte Verita's dissolution in 1920, Graser remained der Evangelimann for its vagabond, politically subversive ideals, until his death in 1958, penniless and without disciples or notoriety. Was Monte Verita a failure because it disbanded after twenty years and is little known today? No, because the Asconan idea represented spores in the wind, invisible, innumerable, ubiquitous, comments Martin Green\u2014a lyric scherzo of conscious defiance of bourgeois-majority rule played out on the bucolic frontiers of civilization. We must see Ascona as one in a chain, a series of protest centers recurrently activating themselves in a reaction against the industrializing and urbanizing action of civilization. Certainly a roster of influential artists and intellectuals visited Ascona during its twenty-year tenure, steeping themselves in its countercultural milieu: Hermann Hesse, D.H. Lawrence, Isadora Duncan, Max Weber, the anarchist Peter Kropotkin, the dance innovator Mary Wigman, the abstract painter Marianne Werefkin. And countless more were positively infected by the Asconan idea through news, rumor, gossip, and writings about its lifestyle. Max Brod wrote Das Grosse Wagnis in 1918, a novel about distorted idealism in a settlement in the Alps administered by a cultural drop-out named Dr. Askonas. Gerhart Hauptmann's novel about Ascona\u2014The Heretic of Soana in which a young Catholic priest deserts Christ for Eros after encountering a village of social radicals\u2014captured its spirit so well it was a bestseller in its time, selling 140,000 copies by 1925, and formed part of the literary propaganda for eroticism, says Green. The Asconan ideals even touched Mohatmas Gandhi, contributing to his spiritual politics of satyagraha ( standing by truth) and his Hind Swaraj, a repudiation of allopathic medicine and an advocacy of Nature cures; he implemented many of the Asconan values at his Tolstoy Farm community in South Africa between 1893-1914. The staidly pious Asconan natives may have survived the dissolution of Monte Verita, those new-age patricians on the hill, but they never forgot them. In 1933, colleagues of C.G. Jung began holding their annual Eranos conferences on religion, symbolism, and depth psychology at Ascona. In 1978, interest in the formative days of Ascona\u2014remembered by local residents as having once been a place of polenta, black bread, and poverty\u2014kindled a retrospective exhibition called Monte Verita Ascona\u2014der Berg der Wahrheit. It was recalled that once Hoffman, Oedenkoven, Graser, and the rest of the Naturmenschen had been scornfully regarded as Kurpfuschern, even as potentially dangerous, by the local Swiss authorities. But so it perenially is: protesters, rebels, and reformers are necessarily social irritants and cultural subversives, and the Wagnerian Lebensreformers of Ascona were no exception. From our perspective today we can only cheer them on in retrospect, grateful that their unruly example took root and flowered. Christmas Dinner with the Uncles Surviving the Holidays with Natural Remedies Here are some simple tips from different modalities of alternative medicine on how to self-medicate to make it through the holidays using natural remedies available over-the-counter. These recommendations come from certified naturopaths, but if you have any question about suitability for yourself, first consult a credentialed health practitioner. There are always Uncles at Christmas, wrote Dylan Thomas in A Child's Christmas in Wales, his classic paean to the holiday season as celebrated in a hill-perched Welsh fishing village. There were also some few small aunts, not wanted in the kitchen, nor anywhere else for that matter, [who] sat on the very edges of their chairs, poised and brittle, afraid to break, liked faded cups and saucers. All of us, once, were as charmed and innocent as strawberries as the young narrator of Thomas' fond memory of Christmas with relatives. For dinner, we had turkey and blazing pudding, and after dinner the Uncles sat in front of the fire, loosened all their buttons, put their large moist hands over their watch chains, groaned a little and slept, writes Thomas. Many of us, today, are those aunts and uncles who came to Thanksgiving or Christmas dinner and overate, talked too loud, complained, laughed, fell asleep in their chairs, woke, had tea, shouted at the dogs, cajoled the cats, played with the children, and then eventually packed themselves up in mufflers and thick coats and staggered on home. Holidays almost always mean excess: too much drink, food, talk, noise, gaiety, socializing, time spent with relatives you don't especially like, contrarieties and resentments barely zipped up over the sherry, secret loves and fantasies and hatreds and epiphanies languishing inarticulate on the tips of tongues. Invariably, there is a price to pay for these excesses. Heartburn, indigestion, flatulence, cramps, headaches, poor sleep, fatigue, drowsiness\u2014we all know the symptoms. The dog was sick, Auntie Dosie had to have three aspirins, Thomas observes, and in the rich and heavy afternoon, the Uncles [were] breathing like dolphins and the snow descending. Dylan Thomas beautifully sets the scene for a memorable Christmas dinner with the Uncles, that is to say, the whole clan, even the dogs and cats. But the fulsome poet never tells us how to survive the holidays, unless you consider falling asleep and snoring in your easy chair with your palms floating on an overfed belly a kind of survival. That's what we'll do here in this modest appendage to a child's (and grownup's) Christmas in Wales\u2014or Boston, Peterborough, Northampton, Bennington, or Providence, using simple, easy-to-use natural remedies from the medicine chest of alternative medicine. Fear of Flying: Let's retrace our steps: first we had to get here, to our inlaws for the holiday weekend. There's a good chance we came by airplane, so let's be honest: the only people who truly trust airplanes are Navy pilots who fly their Harriers upside down for practice. Perhaps you like being there, but you don't enjoy getting there. So if fear of flying is your fort\u00e9, take a dose of homeopathic Arnica (30C) before take-off, during the flight, and on landing. If you can't stand (or sit through) those sudden lurches up, down, and sideways as your 747 hits air pockets, take homeopathic Borax (6C or 12X), once every three hours while travelling. Play it extra prudent and fortify yourself with Mimulus, a flower remedy which you can take every 30 minutes until you feel more relaxed or the plane lands and the problem goes away (into its hangar). Should you travel by boat or bus and your travelling companions are nausea, giddiness, sweating, or pallor from the sheer fact of motion, try homeopathic Tabacum (6C) once every three hours until you feel better. If you are truly fore-sighted, you will drink cupsful of chamomile or ginger tea the day before you leave, to calm your nerves in advance. Chilling Out: Despite everything, it was still a rough trip. The plane was late, the bus had a flat tire, you took the wrong exit on the expressway and didn't realize it for 100 miles, and you're in a different, even strange house and don't feel quite yourself. Lock yourself in the bathroom and start drawing a bath. Sprinkle a dozen drops of rosemary essential oil in an empty plastic yogurt container; fill slowly with hot water; then drizzle the contents into the water as it flows out of the tap. Add a standard bubble bath mixture so that the bath water gets luxuriously bubbly. Then dump three cups of Epsom salts into the water, stirring until they are fully dissolved. Immerse the weary body and soul under the froth and remain in place for a minimum of 20 minutes. The rosemary will reintegrate you, helping you feel yourself again. The Epsom salts will miraculously digest your stress and tension, leaving no trace of them. Prepare to collapse on your bed in a swoon of relaxation for another 30 minutes after drying yourself off. Enjoy the chill. If you're a glutton for wonderful sensations, do this bath again, but this time use lavender oil to experience a possibly irretrievable descent into complete mellowness. Meeting the Family: This after all is why you're here, except maybe Falstaffian conviviality is not your specialty. Still, it's time to face the enemy. Flower remedies can help out here, depending on your situation. If you're concerned about social status or social approval in groups, take Goldenrod. If expressing yourself and overcoming considerable inbred sensitivity is a problem, take Golden Yarrow. Perhaps you hate everyone in your family or inwardly burn with jealousy and envy; if so, please quickly take some Holly. Maybe you can't be bothered to cope with the slow pace of family sharing, so take Impatiens to get through the weekend without being thrown out of the clan. If you are at the other extreme and at age 40 expect your mother to bring you breakfast, lunch, afternoon tea, dinner, and bedtime snack while you lollygag in your pajamas in bed, perhaps Milkweed will help you finish the weaning process. The Turkey Sends Its Bill: The inevitable has happened: you have prodigiously overeaten. You may not fall asleep in your chair, breathing like dolphins as Dylan Thomas' uncles did, but your stomach feels as if it might explode. Your holiday has quickly entered the too much stage. Take one dose of homeopathic Nux vomica (30c) but skip the after-dinner coffee as it will probably antidote the action of this remedy. Now your stomach is feeling a little more hollow but your intestines are moving embarassingly towards that indelicate state William Shakespeare once likened to making a trumpet of your ass. There goes your abdomen extending as if filled with a helium balloon. Unless you prefer to retreat to the woodshed for the next two hours as your flatulence equips a brass quintet, you'd better resort to homeopathy again. If your flatulence is made worse from taking sugar-based foods and being in a crowd of relatives and is mostly engaging the left side of your intestines, take one dose of homeopathic Argentum Nitricum (6C or 12X) every three hours until you have improvement or the party is over and it doesn't matter. If you are burping and turning into a one-man gas company after too many rich desserts, with intestinal discomfort on your right side, take one dose of homeopathic Carbo vegetabilis (6C or 12X) every three hours until you have impovement. If your dyspeptic signature includes sour burps, discomfort on the right side, and a kind of rolling flatulence between the hours of 4-8 p.m., take one dose of homeopathic Lycopodium (6C or 12X) once every three hours until the winds die down. Faxxing the Sandman: You've made it through the first day, eaten, bathed, slipped into a deliciously comfortable bed, and find you can't sleep. You never get insomnia yet here it is: no sand in your eyes unless you figure something out. If you're feeling nervous or in sensory overload, take Dill flower remedy every 15 minutes until you forget to take it anymore because it's time for breakfast and you're waking from a refreshing sleep. If you have repetitive, obsessive thoughts and your mind will not shut up, take White Chestnut flower remedy. If you're wandering around the house like an unquiet ghost, try an herbal tea of chamomile, passion flower, or valerian. If you did overdo it on the Guinness or Bloody Mary's, drink 12-16 ounces of pure water before sleeping; this will help prevent your body from drying out and producing a really obnoxious hangover. In the morning, take extra B-vitamins to soothe the irritated nervous system and replace vital nutrients depleted by your uncharacteristic indulgences; don't take the Bs in the evening, they will keep you awake and alert. Thank God, We Are a Musical Nation: A character in Under Milk Wood, Dylan Thomas' play for voices, once resignedly quipped this after hearing too much singing of a less than perfect quality. If your family is a musical tribe and you sang like a diva for hours yesterday, your larynx may not be happy this morning. It may be sore at you. For a sore throat, here are a variety of possibilities: take two Kyolic garlic capsules every four hours until improvement, then two capsules four times daily for five days afterwards. Take 30 drops of Goldenseal tincture once every four hours. Take one dose every three hours of homeopathic Aconite (6C) if you have sore throat plus mild fever. In addition, take one gram hourly of vitamin C until you have improvement or reach bowel tolerance in the form of diarrhea. Gargle hourly with a strong mixture of salt (one tablespoon) and warm water (one cup). The Joy of Moving: All in all, it's not a great morning. You're up but you can't go. Your intestinal peristalsis is taking the weekend off. You'll have to forego your morning coffee, but if you want movement today, or even tomorrow, take one dose of homeopathic Nux vomica (30C) today; then again once daily for the next two days. This evening, help things along by taking two to four tablets of Swiss Kriss herbal laxative before going to sleep. You'll be lighter in the morning. While you're taking precautions, get a head start on avoiding indigestion today by taking two tablespoons of apple cider vinegar mixed with one tablespoon of honey in a glass of warm water before meals. Don't Reach for the Prozac: Holidays with the family can produce peculiar feelings. Perhaps a family member is permanently missing or a favorite uncle or grandmother is very sick or you just miss the folks and wished you didn't live in Bar Harbor and they in Anchorage. If depression arises, head for the bathtub again, this time to soak yourself in a strong infusion of thyme, melissa, or rosemary essential oils, prepared as described above. Mix three drops of neroli essential oil with two teaspoons of soybean oil, then gently rub onto your solar plexus and the nape of your neck. Breathe deeply and relax for ten minutes until your spirits lift. You're So Sensitive: It is truly hard to avoid playing out some of your perversely favorite interaction scenarios with parents, siblings, relatives, or guests, so unless you enjoy the social equanimity of someone like His Holiness the Dalai Lama at a Chinese dim sim buffet, here are more rescue remedies from the world of flowers. Take Snapdragon for irritabilty around family members. Take Violet for shyness in a new, untested social situation.Take Pink Yarrow if you feel overly sensitive and are painfully absorbing the emotional disturbances of the people around you. Take Chamomile for a general release of tension and nervousness. Take Walnut if you feel your mind stupidly slipping into old, rejected thoughts, beliefs, or influences, especially if you've been struggling to put all this behind you for the last 12 months. Take Elm if you feel you've shouldered too much responsibility in this dysfunctional family and cannot take any more, at least today. Finally, take Centaury if you feel you're too easily influenced, swayed, or commandeered by the louder, bossier ones in your party. As before, take one dropperful of flower remedy every 15\u201420 minutes until you feel your emotions shift, then take once every one to two hours for the rest of the day, then once every four to six hours the next day. Removing the Vise: You made it through lunch without overeating, getting heartburn, or billowing into antisocial flatulence. Instead, you have a headache. Of course, you could take an aspirin, but you could also combine six drops each ofpepper-mint and lavender essential oils with three drops of a pure vegetable oil then massage gently on both temples. Or, dribble a dozen drops of rosemary essential oil on a damp facecloth, take a hot shower, hold the facecloth up to your nose and slowly inhale the rosemary fumes until your head clears. The Wrong Kind of Chilled Out: You didn't quite shake that sore throat in time. Now your body is half thinking about having a cold for the holidays. If you weigh around 150 pounds, you can safely take between 10,000-20,000 milligrams of vitamin C over the next 24 hours, divided into eight three-hour intervals. You may also safely take\u2014just this once\u2014between 100,000 to 300,000 units of vitamin A divided into four sequenced doses spaced six hours apart. That's 25,000 to 40,000 I.U. every six hours. At the same time take about ten garlic capsules in the first six hours of the first signs of your cold. This may sound intense, but it comes with the imprimatur of well-known alternative medicine specialists. Here are more possibilities. If you're from Arizona and you're visiting the folks in the White Mountains and your fingers and feet remain cold despite socks and gloves, prepare a hearty bowl of miso soup, mixing two tablespoons of dark miso to one cup of boiled water. Your extremities will warm up in five minutes, guaranteed. Take homeopathic Aconite (6C) at the first sign of a cold in three doses spaced over a 24-hour period. Take 30 drops of Echinacea herbal tincture four times during the day. Drink peppermint, yarrow, and ginger tea. Sprinkle eucalyptus or peppermint essential oil on a damp washcloth and inhale while in a steaming shower. Chop a fresh onion into tiny pieces, soak in two tablespoons of honey, then eat this during the day. Tears on Leaving: There are people in this holiday blowout whom you will genuinely miss and whose company you will only reluctantly depart. Take Honeysuckle flower remedy if you feel strongly attached to one person and your experiences go way back. Take Willow if you realize, shaking hands with Aunt Milly, that you are brimming with resentment on account of something she said, didn't do, promised, forgot, or ought to have done, now or thirty years ago. Take Mariposa Lily if you feel that your young niece must be your daughter from a past life and you want to envelop her in even more motherly protection and comfort. If you're feeling glued to the sofa when you're supposed to be dashing out the door and sluggishness weighs you down like a suitcase of bricks, take a restorative dropperful of Cayenne to fire up your will power. Life in Wales: If all else fails, go outside for a long walk. Forget about everything. Have a nice fantasy or virtual reality excursion into your thoughts. That's what the young Dylan Thomas did for at least half of his Welsh Christmas. He wandered around town thinking about fishes swimming through snow, of fire brigades chasing after gloriously false alarms, of small, dry ghostly voices crooning through the keyhole of an abandoned house. Returning home, into the cries of the dock birds and the hooting of ships out in the whirling bay, he found the aunts were serving homemade parsnip wine and the uncles were awake, jolly at teatime as the ice cake loomed in the center of the table like a marble grave and Auntie Hannah laced her tea with rum because it was only once a year. Content with his heron-rimmed Welsh world, with its holiday music, lights, and steadily falling night, Thomas' child bid this holiday farewell with a few words to the close and holy darkness. Whether he slept the sleep of the well-digested Thomas doesn't say, but if you take his elegiac Welsh sensibility and mix it with the prudent first aid of natural medicine, chances are you will not only survive the holidays but remember them fondly afterwards. Scouting the Right Practitioner First Steps in Choosing Natural Medical Approaches Part of the mastery of natural medicines for a consumer is to identify which modality is best suited to you and your particular constitution. While acupuncture and homeopathy are both empirically validated, one may work better for you than the other. Here are a few tips about how to evaluate them, and a few other approaches, for your best benefit. With her left arm almost numb, her fingertips cold to the touch, and moderate pain assailing her entire body, Betty LaFontaine did what most Americans would do in a medical emergency\u2014she consulted an M.D., in this case, a vascular surgeon. He performed a battery of tests then concluded that as Betty had no pulse in her left arm when raised, the nerve supply must somehow be cut off. Her M.D. prescribed a set of physical exercises but when, after three days of exercising, Betty's pain only intensified, the doctor advised surgery to remove her top left rib to give her veins and nerves more breathing space inside her chest. Aside from the fact this operation would cost several thousand dollars, require six weeks of recovery time, and produce considerable loss of worktime and wages, Betty didn't like the idea at all. It was her good fortune at this point that a friend tipped her off about chiropractic. The chiropractor took X-rays of Betty's neck and shoulder and examined her physical reflexes. It was obvious to him that certain nerves in her neck, which feed the left arm, were pinched (chiropractors call it subluxated) by the misalignment of several cervical vertebrae. During a ten-day period Betty's chiropractor adjusted her neck four times; it was a relatively straightforward, simple, painless manipulation taking only minutes, and costing about $35 a session (or, with X-rays, initial exam, and four treatments, about $400). While Betty lay comfortably on a padded table, her chiropractor used his hands to apply a sudden and precise force (as chiropractors describe it) to her vertebrae to remove nerve interference caused by displaced vertebrae. Her relief was instant and sustained. After only four sessions Betty enjoyed complete, lasting relief from all her symptoms: no numbness, no coldness, no pain\u2014and no surgery. Chiropractic doesn't always work that fast and that thoroughly (although it does, reliably, almost immediately remove the acute symptoms of pain and physical discomfort); many more sessions over a period of several months may be required before a relatively permanent structural change occurs. Betty was stunned when she reflected that the proposed surgery, in addition to its cost and debilitating complications, wouldn't have resolved her problem, because to a chiropractor it's obvious you can't correct a pinched nerve in the neck by removing a rib. In fact, from a chiropractic viewpoint, that would almost qualify as malpractice. With her rib out, her neck nerves would still be pinched. Betty was so impressed with chiropractic that soon afterwards she became office manager at her own chiropractor's busy practice. These days, if you chat with her in the waiting room, Betty will be the first to confidently suggest you needn't always resort to an M.D. at the first sign of medical trouble. The United States is world-renowned for allopathic, conventional medicine of high professional standards. America's approximately 500,000 M.D.s pride themselves, understandably, on the achievements of their sophisticated high-technology approach to medicine. But they're not too likely to inform patients that often allopathy isn't the best or only course of treatment. Most M.D.s are reluctant to tell you that any one of a cluster of holistic natural therapies\u2014such as chiropractic, homeopathy, naturopathy, herbalism, acupuncture, or nutrition\u2014might do the job a lot better, cheaper, more thoroughly, more safely, and without unwanted side-effects and complications. If you ask a stridently mainstream M.D. why, he'll probably reply that allopaths don't believe natural medicine is better, that they don't believe it's sufficiently founded on a scientific basis, and that it may have pockets of unlicensed quacks. And quite accurately your mainstream M.D. will also point out that insurance companies often do not reimburse as fully (or at all) for the various natural approaches; that accessibility to holistic practitioners is somewhat limited once you leave urban centers; that therapeutic effects may be slower and subtler and may require some cooperation by the patient; and that it may be hard for consumers to know which practitioners are competent and responsible because unlike allopathy, where M.D.s are licensed according to uniform standards, regulations for natural care-givers vary widely from state to state, if they exist at all. All of which tends to make natural medicine controversial, but that's no reason not to consider it as an alternative. Many Americans don't realize that conventional medicine, or allopathy, represents a philosophy of therapy, but not the final word on what's efficacious in healing. Simply put, other nonal-lopathic therapies work very well too\u2014often better. Allopathy, its critics argue, too often depends on invasive, surgical procedures and tests, high-technology interventions, a warehouse of antibiotics and powerful biochemicals; further, it often costs too much, has (sometimes) awful side-effects, sometimes shoots in the dark and misses (as in Betty's misdiagnosis), and generally ignores the whole person in favor of the localized pathology. Allopathy says healing comes from outside, brought by the medicine, the doctor, the machine, whereas holistic medicine contends that true healing originates within the human body and its innate vitality, and that medicines and techniques only awaken and stimulate this. An encouraging trend is that some M.D.s are becoming holistic, adopting some of the thinking and practices of natural medicine thereby giving consumers the best of both worlds. At the heart of holistic natural medicine is an unwavering appreciation for the integrity of the individual, for the whole person\u2014and that means mind, body, emotions, vitality, lifestyle, attitude, and presenting symptoms. A practitioner of this kind of medicine, whether it's a chiropractor, acupuncturist, or homeopath, makes a diagnosis and prescribes treatment based on everything she can find out about the patient, not just whether he has too much Streptococcus in his throat or chronic heartburn. Frequently, the holistic practitioner encourages, if not expects, the patient to actively engage in the healing process by changing eating and lifestyle habits, examining and changing inner attitudes, detoxifying the body through herbs and fasting\u2014all of which encourage one to heal from within. Holistic medicine asks the client to take responsibility for one's newfound health by adjusting attitude and lifestyle to favor early prevention over last minute crisis intervention. Chiropractic: Today chiropractic, literally the therapy done with the hands, is a physical manipulative technique widely practiced throughout the U.S. by some 35,000 trained and licensed chiropractors, called D.C.s. It's probably the most widely accepted of the alternative natural medicines. The reputation of chiropractic has steadily grown since Daniel David Palmer, its originator, introduced its clinical principles in 1895 in Davenport, Iowa. In 1913, Kansas became the first state to license chiropractic, but today it's licensed in all 50 states, requiring a four-year specialized college program for certification. With an estimated 13 million patients annually, it's now America's second largest health-care system, even bigger than the more mainstream osteopathy which has about 28,000 U.S. practitioners. In Palmer's model of chiropractic, the correct alignment of the 24 spinal vertebrae\u2014meaning, with no pinching of nerves by displaced or subluxated vertebrae\u2014is crucial to nerve system function and thus overall bodily health because it is the nervous system that controls and coordinates all internal organs and bodily functions. In Palmer's view, structure governs function, which means that displacement of the spinal vertebrae restrict nerve force ( pinching the nerves) and thereby compromise organic function. When the spinal structure is distorted, this interferes with the nerve supply to various organs or muscles, and dysfunction results. If, for example, you have symptoms that include indigestion, heartburn, and stomach discomfort, you may find that your sixth thoracic vertebrae in your midback is displaced; if you have poor circulation in the legs, swollen or weak ankles, leg cramps or cold feet, it may be because your fifth lumbar vertebrae at the top of your buttocks is subluxated. Chiropractic doesn't claim that the subluxation always produces these symptoms, but it suggests that a chronic subluxation will maintain, even exacerbate, organic problems such as these. Chiropractic is an obvious first choice for potential relief from all obvious musculoskeletal complaints, such as back pains, aches, and strains, whiplash injuries, facial neuralgia, sciatica, arthritic conditions, bursitis, stiff neck, restriction of movement, and headaches. But chiropractic also successfully addresses a host of apparently indirect conditions including allergy, respiratory and gastrointestinal disorders, neuritis, migraine, high blood pressure, shingles, sinusitis, constipation, bronchial asthma, according to information provided by both Michael Copland-Griffiths, D.C. in his Dynamic Chiropractic Today and Susan Moore, D.C., in her Chiropractic\u2014The Art and Science of Body Alignment. Chiropractic treatment works best with muscular and structural imbalances before they can contribute to or even produce serious organic problems, dysfunctions, and degenerative diseases. You wouldn't consult a chiropractor for cancer, atherosclerosis, or immune system dysfunctions\u2014that's too late for their style of physical spinal manipulation; but you could wisely have a treatment long before your subluxated vertberae help create those more serious organic problems. The success of chiropractic treatment depends largely on the training and expertise of the practitioner. Chiropractic is sometimes criticized, even by loyal patients, for being inconclusive, meaning, your vertebrae get misaligned again and you're back on the table for frequent remedial adjustments. This is due partly to the fact there are different schools and approaches to practice within chiropractic, old styles and fresh innovations. There are in fact 36 different types of chiropractic adjustment techniques. Chiropractors frequently call upon related disciplines in their work, such as applied kinesiology, sacral-occipital technique, acupuncture, massage, reflexology, and aromatherapy. The best chiropractors\u2014especially those who start by re-establishing the stability of the spine from the sacrum up\u2014effect sustained structural improvement in about three months and don't want you back on their tables except for occasional maintenance check-ups. Homeopathy: The therapeutic principle underlying homeopathy is simple but profound: Like cures like. Homeopathy's law of similars means if you have a skin irritation or even acute measles, for instance, you might take Rhus tox, a remedy derived from poison ivy. You needn't fear that you're ingesting the dreadful leaves of poison ivy itself; homeopathic remedies (customarily in pill form, drawn from a huge repertory derived from the plant and mineral world) are extremely dilute forms of the original substances, so subtle, in fact, that chemically there is no trace of the material substance discernible in the pill. Homeopathy calls this "}
