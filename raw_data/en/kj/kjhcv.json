Although the world slowed down, my life seemed to speed up. Planning, working all hours, juggling home schooling, finding solutions to the new challenges, all confined with the four walls of our home. Thoughts of travel parked firmly in the back of my mind as I ploughed on making the best of a bad situation. Eventually travels restrictions eased, but the idea of lateral flow, PCR tests and queuing at airports filled me with dread. Two years on, still no holiday, having recently recovered from Covid, starting to experience peri-menopause symptoms, my mind and body was definitely now frazzled. I needed a break, a little bit of 'me' time, a place to unwind, chillout, read a good book with a bottle of wine! Travelling as a solo traveller I didn't want to travel far, still no planes for me and no long treks to the other side of the country. Instead, I settled on an overnight stay just over an hour away in the beautiful Surrey Hills. Arriving at the picturesque village of Hambledon, The Merry Harriers, with its origins dating back to the 16th century, was a welcome sight after my trip round the M25. Bursting with charm and character, their family and dog friendly inn promised to offer excellent food, award-winning local ales and wines, first rate accommodation and an element of the unexpected with a llama trek. I discovered the [Merry Harriers](https://merryharriers.com/) is a natural stopover for walkers, cyclists and dog owners and as it turns out the perfect place for a solo traveller in need of some rest & relaxation. Staying in a shepherd hut Staying in one of their 5 [shepherd huts](https://merryharriers.com/accommodation/rooms/shepherd-huts/), I was soon relaxing in a cosy, stylish space packed with luxuries reminiscent of a hotel suite! Each hut comes with downy double bed, underfloor heating, log burner and a cosy seating area with games. The was a little kitchen corner where I discovered my complimentary bottle a local wine and fresh milk. The bathroom included a luxurious walk-in rain shower with toiletries and soft towelling bathrobes. My hut was equipped with Netflix enabled smart TV and thoughtful little extras include a hair dryer and a hot water bottle. Outside a firepit for marshmallow toasting under the stars, and teak sun loungers primed for curling up with a good book on a sunny afternoon, completed the accommodation. Curled on the bed, looking out across the pond I spent the next few hours just watching the leaves fall, the bright blue sky evening fading into a dark Autumn evening. No book, no TV... just watching the miracles of nature unfold. Dining in the pub as a solo traveller was lovely, there was someone celebrating a birthday, there were children, dogs, laughter and a party atmosphere that I haven't seen in a long time. An excellent sized fish & chips and chocolate brownie was the perfect meal before heading back to the hut to light the log burner and toast marshmallows. Lessons from my llama trek Next morning, after devouring my breakfast (it was so good to not have to cook my own food) I set off with Clara for my [llama trek](https://merryharriers.com/llama-treks/). I wasn't sure what to expect but I had fully intended to trek the Surrey Hills. Used to fast paced walking I was ready for this adventure. However, my Llama had other ideas. His slow pace, as he enjoyed a smorgasbord of nettles, holly and gorse, meant the trek was anything but fast paced. I wondered if I was doing it wrong, but no amount of talking to Goji or gently pulling on his lead was going to make him budge. It took me an hour to realise that there was no need to rush, there was no deadline, no exact place we needed to be. My Llama was reminding me to just 'slow down' take notice of the surroundings and just enjoy the walk while chatting with Clara. Once I embraced that it was going to be more of an amble that a trek, I relaxed... so did Goji and we eventually reached the view-point looking across the Surrey Hills. I had a wonderful break, the place was beautiful, the people friendly and the llamas wise. I will definitely be back but next time I am taking my family as I want them to enjoy this amazing place as well and to see that other lesson I can learn from my llama! Winter Wellness Guests will enjoy the feelings of contentment and comfort that they get from this cosy stay which includes a Hygge Welcome Pack comprising a blanket, luxury hot chocolate, marshmallows and a book all about Hygge.
