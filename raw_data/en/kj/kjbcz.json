After the first EEG, my doctor told me I had epilepsy and put me on Tegretol. I took the medication only for a year, and then moved over to Klonopin, which I have taken ever since. When I was 22, I had another EEG, and the doctor told me I was fine. I was living overseas at the time of my 2nd EEG and I really can't vouch for the expertise of the doctor. Despite what the doctor told me of my EEG, my seizures continued and had never stopped. The seizures I was having were incredibly breif lasting only a second or two. My eyes would roll back into my head, I would NOT fall to the ground. I'd lose muscle control from the neck and above, and kind of twitch my head back and forth with very small jerks that were almost unnoticeable. In any event, I was sick with the flu recently, and during my doctor's visit, I had one of these seizures, and he insisted I see a nuerologist again. I had an EEG and MRI, and I've been told again that I have a seizure disorder. I just started taking Lamictal. I'm very keen to how my body responds to foods, stress, and specific situations. If I were able to simply avoid all the situations that trigger my seizures which in most cases are stress-induced, I believe that I could live seizure-free without medication. But that is not possible. What IS possible - is for me to overcome the situations that trigger my seizures with a different mental outlook. Although I have not been able to successfully change my mental approach to the situations that cause my seizures all the time, I have had success in many instances. To sum it up, I strongly believe that it would be possible to take control of my seizure disorder through a non-medicated approach. Perhaps my seizures are just different. I don't even know at this point what kind of seizures I have. All I know is that both of my EEGs in the US showed with certainty that I have a seizure disorder. I have left a message with my doctor today, to get more information on his diagnosis, and will post it here when I receive that information (see below). I will continue taking my Lamictal. What I want to know is if anybody agrees that it could be possible to correct a form of seizures with a non-medicated mental approach; any doctors or patients? I am not a scientologist. In fact, I'm not even sure what their approach to a seizure disorder is. I am just stating what I think I have the power to do, and want to find out if anybody shares those ideas. Update I spoke with my doctor today. The seizures that I have been having are simple and complex focal seizures.

I have TLE and been suffering petit mal seizures since I was a kid, but after tests around late teens I was put on Tegretol. Now I'm 30, on Depakene after trying almost all medications, and back to square 1. To be honest, I feel that the only person who can take care of my case is myself and other people with epilepsy by sharing experiences, and not any doctor. I've been to many doctors, but I think being a doctor knowing all the theory is quite different from being a person who's living with epilepsy. The last couple of doctors I've been to (based on their name and reputation), made me feel just like a guinea pig, and nothing more. One was trying different meds to see which ones work, and got me poisoned. I was actually seeing double and felt like the world was rolling backwards every time I took the meds. The other...he just never listened to what I would say, and would just add more drugs and increase the dosage! Anyways...what was best for me to control seizures and feel healthy: - Stress free life - I got my worst seizure after being extremely stressed out at work - Exercise - even if light exercise to keep the blood flowing and feeling healthy - Healthy diet - Drink enough water especially when I wake up, make sure no poisons or additives are in my diet like MSG, aspartame and food additives/colours, no foods that trigger attacks such as red meat, caffeine, chocolate aubergine, tea/coffee and canned food. The best thing I found for myself is to monitor my diet and pay attention to what triggers my attacks. I'm currently living without any supplements or vitamins. Right now, I don't have a doctor since the one I went to last left the country (the Dr. who put me on Depakene). But what I would like to do is to control attacks without living on medications, especially those with nasty side effects. I hope the above was of any help. I would be really grateful if you can share any details regarding supplements and vitamins. All the best. L. Hi, Thanks all for sharing your information.

Re: Controlling seizures without medication Submitted by gregs_seizures on Sun, 2009-05-10 - 12:20 I agree with everything you said labush. I have had the most success it seems by living a healthy stress-free life. I started on Tegretol when I was 19. But later moved to Klonopin. Now that the seizures have picked up again, I am on Lamictal. I am 35 now. I will continue to take whatever medication the doctor suggests. But I think if it is possible to defeat the problem while off medication, it should also be possible to defeat the problem the same way while on medication. Probably the biggest mistake for me would be to give up on the ways I feel I have had the most success, and surrender to the possibility that the mediacation will handle it for me. I am only on the third week of Lamictal and until I am into week 5, I will not be taking the full dosage that the doctor has prescribed. At this point, I am still having seizures. I do hope that the medication will stop the seizures, but I don't want to be reliant on JUST the medication either. I do believe there are other ways to handle this problem. I am proof of that. I have \"felt\" where I need to be in regards to my mental state, in order to stop the seizures. The only problem is that it is difficult for me to be there all the time. I have not mastered control of that mentatlity. It may sound a bit crazy, but obviously after reading some other posts here, I am not alone in that thinking. I agree with everything you said labush.

Re: Controlling seizures without medication Submitted by HHC on Sun, 2009-05-10 - 13:31 Lamictal is a good drug. It is usually used with another drug. I'm taking Lamictal with Topamax and Depakote (For the time being) for my JME. The only thing I don't like about Lamictal is that you start to lose and or your hair starts thinning out! It started for me at age 20 and I'm 24!! I'll like to find alternative treatments, diets, any route that can get me off these meds. I've been on all the meds for JME. Topamax is the most recent. Started it 2 1/2 months ago and I'm giving it a 50/50 chance of ditching it. I had a grand mal after the transition from Depakote. Thats the only reason I'm on it and it sucked getting back on it. When I got off of it, lost 15 lbs and when I got back on it, gained 10!! Got to love Depakotes side effects!! Thats one thing I can't stand and I know a lot of you guys and gals out there can't stand is some of those can't harsh side effects that effect everyday life. Topamax's side effects has been hitting me hard since I'm at college and it's been giving me problems with memory, my spelling, and my speech. At the house I get that itchy feeling in my feet but the one that scares me the most and I talk to my pharmacist about it was when I get this feeling, almost like freaking out, a hallucination, my head going a million miles a hour, sweating, and while thats going on my heart is racing. This only last a few minutes. It doesn't lead up to a seizure. The pharmacist never heard of this side effect!!!! She said if it last and doesn't go away, call the good old doc! I have more side effects I can talk about but no need for it as I had to see more doctors because of it!! Example: Urologist, not a good one to see for a 24 year old. I know a good percentage of people are not a big fan of marijuana as a alternative treatment but I'm also considering that as an option since I live in California and for medical it is legal. MY EXPERIENCE with mj has never had any draw backs, no seizures created from smoking it. The years in high school I smoked, I had no seizures! I don't know if it help or not but who knows if it did!

Not really long after I started this thread. I feel much better without the medicine. I tried to explain to the doctor that my seizures were related to stress in some ways. Whether it is mental stress, physical stress, or other, there were triggers that I was aware of that would induce a seizure. He never ackowledged what I was saying. Instead he seemed intent on disproving my claim. I still beleive I can control this without meds, and until I have a major fit that I can't explain, I don't think I will ever go back to meds again. I have more clarity about my body chemistry without the extra garbage in their trying to prevent natural occurrences. The medicine is like a dam. It prevents the overflow, but puts a huge amount of pressure on the structure that holds the water in. I'm done with that. I've quit my meds. I quit about 2 months ago.

Re: Controlling seizures without medication Submitted by TaniaJaye on Wed, 2009-04-22 - 20:48 Hi, unfortunately it wouldn't be an option for me to go med free as my TLE seizures occur in clusters and if I forget to take them I end up in Status.... However, I have found that decreasing my stress levels through gentle exercise and giving myself something to focus on such as writing music and poetry, has been a sufficient enough outlet to make a small difference. My partner and I are gradually making many changes in our lives to do all we can to reduce the seizures. I'll keep an eye on this thread though, as I am interested in what people may say about it and the results you and they have with it.

I am a 24 year old female, and I was diagnosed with epilepsy when I was in grade 7. It's been a long time since I have seen a neurologist- I guess it just frightens me. Anyway, I seem to have 2 types, I have petit mal seizures(day dreaming spells) and tonic clonic(grand mal) seizures. My mother, also did have epilepsy. She took me for my first EEG after about 2 years of noticing these odd day dreaming spells that I would constantly have, I had the EEG and was informed that I did indeed, have epilepsy. Never ONCE did I have a tonic clonic seizure until AFTER I was diagnosed and put on Epival. It sucked, to put it frankly..I was taking 6 horse pills a day, at the same time, and I just truely felt like I hated my life(I was in grade 7). I went into a huge depression where all I would do, was sleep. I continued to have tonic clonic seizures every now and then- I also don't think I was that great with taking my meds.. To make a long story short, when I reached high school, I made the decision to stop taking my medication. I just..simply stopped, because I knew that my mother had just stopped..out of the blue, and is now seizure free. After comin off of my medication, I had quite a few tonic clonic seizures. I was having approximately 8 a year, which to some- that is not alot at all, and I am thankful that my case is not nearly as bad as it could be. But yes, I was having 8 a year and now I am down to 2 a year. I am just a normal person my age, i dont do drugs but I have the occasional drink, I dont eat overly healthy, I do have minimal exercise, I have horrible sleep patterns and a desk job. I have come to know my warning signs, which has enabled myself and my friends and family to make sure I am out of harms way to the best of their ability. I also find that keeping myself focused, and alert helps alot as well. And also going to sleep if I do feel one coming on. What I did, probably wasn't for the best, as I did not seek any sort of advice from my neurologist about going off of my meds. In all honesty, I was spoiled little teenage brat who wanted things done her way, and I just said \"well my mom did it, and shes been seizure free for how many years now?!\". I am thankful, that I don't have an overly strong case and that going off of my medication has worked for me, I am not seizure free yet, in fact I just had a tonic clonic seizure on Saturday. I am doing a lot better than I was, but that is how it worked for me. I Know most of you are older than me, but if you are considering going off of your medication, talk to your doctor and make sure everyone around you knows that you are coming off of it.

After taking this for a year, I asked the neurologist if I could stop and he said it was \"too early\". I took this for code that he was not going to take the rap for letting me go off of the drugs and then getting in a car accident or something - so I did it myself. I reduced the prescription slowly. It took over a month to go completely drug free. I was drug free for 13 years - then I had another seizure at home - and another at work about a month later. I'd love to be drug free again, but I love being able to drive a lot more! So, I'm back to the drugs (now Carbitrol) and have been seizure free for over 7 years. I still have brief episodes/auras but they only last 5-10 seconds. That is enough to scare me into staying on the drug therapy. The only encouragement I might be able to give you is that I was under a lot of job related stress AND had sleep apnea when the seizures re-appeared. Maybe if I had taken it easy and had gotten a CPAP machine earlier, the seizures might not have ever reappeared... I'll never know.

Josh has had a couple of periods of time in his life when he was totally seizure free (without medications) for 2-2 1/2 years. We got concerned when they started again when he was 10 yo, and we started medications. He always seemed to be anxious on the medicines (and really dopey on some), and none of them controlled his seizures for any length of time except clonazepam. But, he developed a tolerance to clonazepam, and it was a very long wean from that med. He ended up on zonegran to try to get him off clonazepam, but that didn't control the seizures either. So, he just completed the zonegran wean about 4 weeks ago, and we're trying to get the seizures under control without medication. He really isn't any worse off than he was, but is having a couple of grand mals and a few anxiety attacks per week. Our chiropractor has put him on a number of supplements to help with anxiety (and hopefully seizures). I don't know if they do anything or not, but I'll keep him on them until we get past all this. He's on inositol, cataplex G, and min-tran put out by Standard Process. All of these are sold through health care professionals only. The chiropractor used to be a pharmacist, so we've learned alot working with him and our neurologist (who is very good, but openly admits he doesn't have all the answers for cases like this). One thing to keep in mind is that seizures can happen BECAUSE of medication adjustments, especially coming off a seizure medicine. So don't assume that if you're weaning off something and still having seizures, that it's your condition. It could be the process itself. Another thing to keep in mind is that many seizure medicines are stored in the fat tissues, so it can be 4-6 plus weeks after coming off before your body is clear of the meds. I'll keep you posted as to how this all works for him. I think nutrition and stress levels are key things to watch, but it's been difficult for him to find a middle-ground (teenaged boy, doesn't want to eat totally healthily). I have decided as others on this forum have said, that we need to keep trying things until we find something that works. Josh was a \"guinea pig\" on meds, he's a \"guinea pig\" off meds.

I have decided as others on this forum have said, that we need to keep trying things until we find something that works. Josh was a \"guinea pig\" on meds, he's a \"guinea pig\" off meds. But at least he doesn't have the side effects he was experiencing before!

He quit taking medication and tried to control his seizures through eliminating stress and better diet. How did it go? Well, he can't tell you because he died from a seizure. Christmas Eve 1994 his room-mate went to check why he wasn't up for work and found my brother-in-law dead in his bed. Merry Christmas, eh? You've got nothing to lose--except your life.

LOL a school project! **grin** but over the years i had slowly pulled myself off of pills, i noticed that when i was over medicated i twitched more, on \"monthlys\" i have more problems {i take 1 more tegretol til its over} and i have no problems. now i have started a brand new regimend. i have started taking gabba complex. i take 3 pills morning and 3 night, that takes place of tegretol, and i take topiamate. i now have no problems except for the tingling sensation still, but no headaches like i used too. if you want to find out if you can control them w/o meds, what i did, is i took 1 pill away {in retrospect i would have done it 1/2} for a week, if it works and you do good, then you can go to the next one, most of the time i waited for 2 weeks, and that was only because if something bad happend it always did on the 3rd day for me. the next thing, eating is very important, you need to find foods that are high in gabba. google them. they are mostly the dark vegies if i remember right. also leaving out the fatty foods and dairy as much as possible. then, excersize, walking as much as possible, or what ever, just make sure that you are doing something to make your pulse come up!! don't over do it, this helped \"tire out\" the extra energy in that causes the seizures, i don't know how to explaine it other than that. if i don't do the excersize then i have problems, if i do then i'm good to go. when i don't i get these kinda like screechy squeales in what i imagine is little veines in my head and i can feel it too. and i also have really hard jerks and almost drop to the ground. sometimes almost into a seizure. sooo, i am very careful about the \"excersize\".

I see doctors when I have a problem I can't deal with which I have been doing for many years. I have epilepsy and I hate taking medications for it. I know they are there to help control the electrical impulses hitting in the brain. I have had seizures for more than 50 years some of those were seizure free. You are right when talking about education and learning what medications can do. Any medication including asperin have side effects. What medications for seizures do is control electrical impulses the same medication can cause electrical impulses in others. A good diet helps but I love my steaks seafood and everything else that I have fixed. I would love to live where I could raise my own veggies but I don't I do go to farmers markets and try and buy fresh veggies that were grown near where I live. I bake my own bread which if not eaten in 3 days goes in the fridge because it does not have all the stuff in it so mold will hit it fast especially in a humid environment. Some people need to look at old home remedies they would be surprised at what vinegar water an honey can do if it is taken daily, I have been able to do alot mentally. What most people do not know is that they only use a very small portion of their brain. Once I was put on meds for my epilepsy I steared away from taking anything else. SOme people need pain killers and I know that because my brothers and sister have had to use them. I have had knee surgery which can hurt bad. The first time I took 1 pain killer I gave the rest of the bottle to the doc. the second time I had it 30 years later I was given a filled RX when leaving the hospital which I took none of. My doctor was working on my hand which I had burned and he stated my blood presure was high and I was to see him in 3 days. I asked him what he wanted my blood presure to be. He said normal would be 120/80 I asked what mine was and it was higher than I wanted it. I told him I would have it down to normal and the next visit it was 120/80. He asked what I had done to get it down I told him the mind is a wonderful thing and people can use theirs to help them. Doctors know a lot but people do not know that the doctor is part of a team. The patient is the other part of the team. People need to note their seizures and if they think something triggered the seizure note the trigger. the length of time in the seizure should be noted and the time it takes to get back to normal. Giving the doctor that information gives the doctor more information to work with. He has knowledge of medications and procedures that can help many but each persons seizures are different as are the triggers and medications. The more information he has the better he can serve us.

Re: Controlling seizures without medication Submitted by randres on Wed, 2012-04-11 - 11:08 Hello everyone - i have read the comments in an effort to understand your experiences. I am a researcher for a living so I research EVERYTHING...habit. I have had epilepsy since I was around 12 - the onset of puberty. At the time I was diagnosed with absence seizures and once they stopped over-medicating me I was completely controlled and not perpetually sleeping. I have been fortunate in that I lived a seizure free life until I hit 40 (no side-effects, nothing) - I am on Frisium (clobazam). Then, after a year of begging my neurologist to do something (as I was having absence seizures one day a month - during my cycle) ...wham! Full on tonic clonic (grand mal) seizures - hospitalization and medication jacked up as high as they could. I quickly put a stop to the Epival as I gained a ridiculous amount of weight on it and so they just upped my existing Frisium. A couple things I have learned since then. EVERYONE has a seizure threshold. Literally, everyone on the planet could have a seizure given the right conditions in your brain. Second, the threshold is controlled by hormones. The higher your progesterone, the greater your tolerance. For men and women. For women, when they start with \"the change\" many undergo spikes of estrogen and low levels of progesterone = seizure. The progesterone always needs to be kept elevated or at normal levels. I am right now on the pill (which is of course bad for me but my OB/GYN agreed to as long as I'm not a smoker and my neurologist totally disregards its value \"you can take it if you want to but it won't do anything\". In fact, I tested out his theory and within a week off of the pill, I could feel the absence seizures returning (however brief). Since my absence seizures are now the precursor to a grand mal seizure, I immediately get to a safe place even if nothing happens. I am currently investigating the possibility of controlling my seizures with a far lower dose of the Frisium (30mg instead of 50mg, no birth control pill but using natural progesterone and bio-identical hormones as a substitute. I have eaten healthy my whole life so tend not to focus on diet. I will keep you posted. For me - hormones are directly related to how severe (or not) my seizures get. Here's a tip for you - the next time a dr. prescribes something for you, ask him or her if they know why it works. Then, go ask a pharmacist. I have yet to find a neurologist that understands why or how any of the drugs they are prescribing work...save one. Dr. Blume. I haven't found a good neurologist since he retired.

I also found out that progesterone controlled my seizures when I gave up drugs when I was pregnant. I, too am embarking on a journey, and I would be very interested to hear from you. I have waking epilepsy, and I think similar epilepsy to you. I have the progesterone coil, unfortunately after a time I feel it starts to be less effective. I don't take drugs, but ocassionally I do have the odd fit, when my progesterone level drops off. I have just done some research into neurofeedback particularly something called LENS. Recent research is very promising and there is hope of more devices coming onto the market, especially a device which stimulates the trigennimal nerve (don't think I've spelt that correctly) whilst your asleep. It has yet to come onto the market though-LENS treatment is quite expensive but I'm wililing to give it go and it has a good statistical rate of helping people. I will write on this forum about my experiences. I am interested. Where do you get natural progesterone from? Also the hydro-electric water, could someone give me information on that please? I originally was on epilim, which basically make me into a zombie, however, I wish to get better control over my fits (waking and progesterone related too). I would be very interested to hear form anyone participating on this forum, and I will also write about my experiences too. Thanks Hello, I am in a situation.

I also know that a seizure is an electrical impulse hitting th brain wrong causing a chain reaction. If yoou think you can control all the electrical impulses hitting in your brain go for it. What you need to think about is what can be triggering your seizures. You stated you watch out for foods and stress. Good many different things can trigger seizures. I watch what I eat and try to not get stressed out. Stress can trigger my seizures. Getting too hot too fast can also trigger seizures in epileptics. Been there done that. simple seizures are not long at all mine last split seconds and I'm back to normal in less than a minute. Complex focal I am not fomiliar with. Complex partial I am. Those can be longer. If you neuro calle them FOCAL then I may know what he is talking about. I had Grand Mal, Focol motor and pettit mal seizures but those terms were back in 1963 and used for many years. A focal motor seizure starts in one area of the body and moves. Those seizures can become convulsive. In those seizures I could see hear and understand everything going on around me I just couldn't control anything. They can look like grand mal seizures. They are tiring. The mind can and does many things. I have controlled my blood presure using it. All I need to know is where the doctor wwants it and I can get it down. Kind of like having knee surgery and not taking any pain pills. I block out pain because I do not want any medications enterferring with the meds I take to control my seizures. I hope you get the answers you need but pease do not get off your meds without your doctor telling you to.

They are tiring. The mind can and does many things. I have controlled my blood presure using it. All I need to know is where the doctor wwants it and I can get it down. Kind of like having knee surgery and not taking any pain pills. I block out pain because I do not want any medications enterferring with the meds I take to control my seizures. I hope you get the answers you need but pease do not get off your meds without your doctor telling you to. The medications you are taking are to keep the electrical impulses hitting wrong and make them hit right. "}
