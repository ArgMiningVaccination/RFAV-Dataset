The previous applicant shall respond to a request for agreement, within a period of three months. A partial reference is not admissible . Section 24b Authorisation of a generic medicinal product, docum ent protection (1) In the case of a generic medicinal product wit hin the meaning of sub-section 2, ref- erence can be made, without the previous applicant' s agreement, to the documents referred to in sentence 1 of Section 22 sub-section 2 sentence 1 numbers 2 and 3 and Section 23 sub- section 1, including the expert report referred to in Section 24 sub-section 1 sentences 2 to 4 for the previous applicant's medicinal product (ref erence medicinal product), provided that the reference medicinal product has been authorised for at least eight years or was authorised at least eight years previously; this shall also apply to authorisation in another Member State of the European Union. A generic medicinal product aut horised pursuant to this provision shall not be placed on the market until ten years have elapse d following the first authorisation of the ref- erence medicinal product. The period referred to in sentence 2 shall be extended to a maxi- mum of eleven years if, during the first eight year s of authorisation, the marketing authorisation holder obtains authorisation for one or more new th erapeutic indications which during the sci- entific evaluation conducted prior to their authori sation by the competent higher federal author- ity are held to bring significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing therapies. (2) Authorisation as a generic medicinal product p ursuant to sub-section 1 shall require that the medicinal product in question has the same qualitative and quantitative composition of active substances and the same pharmaceutical form as the reference medicinal product and that the bioequivalence has been demonstrated in bi oavailability studies. The different salts, esters, ethers, isomers, mixtures of isomers, compl exes or derivatives of an active substance - 79 - shall be considered to be one and the same active s ubstance unless their properties differ sig- nificantly with regard to safety or efficacy. In su ch cases, the applicant must submit additional proof of the safety or efficacy of the different sa lts, esters, ethers, isomers, mixture of isomers, complexes or derivatives of the active substance. T he various immediate release oral pharma- ceutical forms shall be considered to be one and th e same pharmaceutical form. The applicant shall not be required to submit bioavailability stu dies if he/she can otherwise demonstrate that the generic medicinal product meets the relevant bi oequivalence criteria in accordance with current scientific knowledge. In cases where the me dicinal product does not meet the require- ments of a generic medicinal product or where the b ioequivalence cannot be demonstrated through bioequivalence studies or in the case of a change in the active substance, therapeutic indication, strength, pharmaceutical form or route of administration vis-\u00e0-vis the reference me- dicinal product, the results of appropriate preclin ical tests or clinical trials shall be provided. In the case of medicinal products intended for use in animals, the corresponding safety studies and in the case of medicinal products intended for use in food-producing animals, the results of corresponding residue tests shall also be submitted . (3) If the reference medicinal product was not aut horised by the competent higher fed- eral authority but by the competent authority of an other Member State, the applicant shall indi- cate in the application form, where the reference m edicinal product is or has been authorised. In this case, the competent higher federal authorit y shall ask the competent authority of the other Member State to transmit within one month a c onfirmation that the reference medicinal product is or has been authorised, together with th e full composition of the reference medicinal product and other documents relevant to the authori sation of the generic medicinal product. In the case where the reference medicinal product has been authorised by the European Medi- cines Agency, the competent higher federal authorit y shall ask the latter for the information and documents referred to in sentence 2. (4) If the competent authority of another Member S tate where an application is submit- ted requests information or documents referred to i n sub-section 3 sentence 2 of the compe- tent higher federal authority, the latter shall res pond to this request within one month, provided that at least eight years have elapsed since the re ference medicinal product was first author- ised. (5) Where a biological medicinal product which is similar to a biological reference me- dicinal product does not meet the conditions for ge neric medicinal products, referred to in sub- section 2 owing to, in particular, differences rela ting to raw materials or differences between the manufacturing processes of the biological medic inal product and the reference biological - 80 - medicinal product, the results of appropriate precl inical tests or clinical trials relating to these deviations must be provided. The type and quantity of the supplementary data to be provided must comply with the relevant criteria according to current scientific knowledge. The results of other tests from the documents submitted for the re ference medicinal product's authorisation shall not be provided. (6) In addition to the provisions laid down in sub -section 1, where an application is made for a new therapeutic indication for a known a ctive substance that has been in general medical use for at least ten years in the European Union, a non-cumulative period of one year of data exclusivity shall be granted for the data g ained from significant preclinical or clinical studies carried out in connection with the new ther apeutic indication. (7) Sub-section 1 sentence 3 and sub-section 6 sha ll not apply to generic medicinal products intended for use in animals. The period re ferred to in sub-section 1 sentence 2 shall be extended: 1. to thirteen years in the case of veterinary medi cinal products intended for use in fish or bees, 2. in the case of veterinary medicinal products in tended for one or more food-producing species, containing a new active substance that had not been authorised in the Commu- nity by 30 th April 2004, by one year for each extension of the marketing authorisation to another food-producing species which takes place wi thin the five years following the granting of the initial marketing authorisation. Th is period shall not, however, exceed a total of thirteen years for a marketing authorisati on for four or more food-producing spe- cies. The prolongation of the ten-year period to eleven, twelve or thirteen years for a veteri- nary medicinal product intended for a food-producin g species shall be granted only if the mar- keting authorisation holder also originally applied for the setting of maximum residues limits for the species covered by the authorisation. (8) If the extension of a marketing authorisation is for a veterinary medicinal product registered pursuant to Section 22 sub-section 3 and relates to a food-producing species and was obtained on submission of new residue tests and new clinical trials, the data obtained in the aforementioned tests shall be covered by an exc lusivity period of three years after the granting of the authorisation. - 81 - Section 24c Additional requests If several holders of a marketing authorisation ha ve to be requested to submit additional documents, the competent higher federal authority s hall notify every holder of a marketing au- thorisation of the documents necessary for the furt her assessment as well as of the names and addresses of the other holders of a marketing autho risation who are involved. The competent higher federal authority shall give those holders o f the marketing authorisation who are in- volved the opportunity to decide among themselves a s to who will submit the documents within a period of time to be determined by the authority. If an agreement is not reached, the compe- tent higher federal authority shall decide and imme diately notify all persons concerned. Unless the other holders of a marketing authorisation choo se to forgo the marketing authorisation granted for their own pharmaceutical product, they shall be obliged to contribute proportionally to the expenditure incurred in the preparation of t he documents, calculated according to the number of marketing authorisation holders involved; they are jointly and severally liable. Sen- tences 1 to 4 shall apply mutatis mutandis to persons using standard marketing authorisations , as well as in cases where documents with the same c ontents are requested from several ap- plicants in ongoing marketing authorisation procedu res. Section 24d General right of use The competent higher federal authority is empowere d to utilize the documents submit- ted to it, with the exception of those referred to under Section 22 sub-section 1 numbers 11, 14 and 15 as well as sub-section 2 number 1, and the e xpert opinion pursuant to Section 24 sub- section 1 sentence 2 number 1, in fulfilling its ta sks under the present Act, provided that at least eight years have elapsed since the medicinal product first received a marketing authorisa- tion in one of the Member States of the European Un ion or a procedure pursuant to Section 24c has not yet been terminated, or in so far as Se ctions 24a and 24b do not contain more special provisions for referring to the documents o f a previous applicant. Section 25 Decision on marketing authorisation (1) The marketing authorisation, together with a m arketing authorisation number, shall be issued in writing by the competent higher federa l authority. The marketing authorisation shall only be applicable to the medicinal product s pecified in the marketing authorisation notice - 82 - and, in the case of medicinal products manufactured according to homeopathic manufacturing procedures, it shall also apply to the degree of di lution mentioned in results published pursuant to Section 25 sub-section 7 sentence 1 of the versi on in force prior to 17 th August 1994 and specified in the marketing authorisation notice. (2) The competent higher federal authority may onl y refuse to grant the marketing au- thorisation if: 1. the documents submitted, including such document s as are to be submitted pursuant to a regulation of the European Community or the Europ ean Union, are incomplete, 2. the medicinal product has not been sufficiently tested in accordance with the confirmed state of scientific knowledge or the other scientif ic information material referred to in Sec- tion 22 sub-section 3 does not correspond to the co nfirmed state of scientific knowledge, 3. the medicinal product is not manufactured in acc ordance with recogni sed pharmaceutical rules or does not meet appropriate quality standard s, 4. the therapeutic efficacy attributed to the medic inal product by the applicant is lacking or is insufficiently substantiated by the applicant in ac cordance with the confirmed state of sci- entific knowledge, 5. the benefit/risk profile is unfavourable, 5a. in the case of a medicinal product containing m ore than one active substance, insufficient grounds are provided to demonstrate that each activ e substance contributes towards a positive assessment of the medicinal product, where by the special features of the par- ticular medicinal product should be considered in a risk evaluation, 6. the stated withdrawal period is not long enough, 6a. in the case of medicated pre-mixes, the test me thods used for the qualitative and quanti- tative detection of the active substances in the me dicated feedstuffs cannot be routinely conducted, - 83 - 6b. the medicinal product is intended for use in fo od-producing animals and contains a pharmacologically active constituent not listed in Table 1 of the Annex to Regulation (EU) No. 37/2010, 7. the placing of the medicinal product on the mark et or its administration to animals would violate legal regulations or a regulation, directiv e, decision or resolution by the European Community or the European Union. The marketing authorisation may not be refused pur suant to sentence 1 number 4, be- cause therapeutic results have been achieved in onl y a limited number of cases. Therapeutic efficacy is lacking if the applicant fails to prove , according to the confirmed state of scientific knowledge at the time, that a therapeutic effect ca n be produced with the medicinal product. Medical experience in the particular therapeutic fi eld shall be considered. Pursuant to sentence 1 number 6b, the marketing authorisation may be ref used if the medicinal product is intended for the treatment of individual equidae to which th e conditions referred to in Article 6 paragraph 3 of Directive 2001/82/EC apply and if it fulfils t he other conditions in Article 6 paragraph 3 of Directive 2001/82/EC. (3) The marketing authorisation shall be refused f or a medicinal product which differs, in the nature or the quantity of its active substances , from a medicinal product bearing the same name which has been authorised for marketing or is already on the market. Deviating from sentence 1, a difference in the quantity of active substances shall be harmless if the medicinal products differ in their pharmaceutical form. (4) If the competent higher federal authority is o f the opinion that a marketing authorisa- tion cannot be granted on the basis of the document s submitted, it shall inform the applicant, stating reasons. The applicant shall then have the opportunity to correct the flaw within an ap- propriate deadline which may not exceed six months. Should these flaws not be corrected within the prescribed deadline, the marketing autho risation shall be refused. After the decision has been taken to refuse the marketing authorisatio n, the submission of documents in order to correct flaws shall not be allowed . (5) The marketing authorisation shall be granted o n the basis of the examination of the documents submitted as well as on the basis of the expert opinions. In the assessment of the documents, the competent higher federal authority m ay utilize its own scientific results, call in experts or request expert opinions. The competent h igher federal authority may examine au- thorisation-related data and documents also in conn ection with a marketing authorisation pur- - 84 - suant to Article 3 paragraph 1 or 2 of Regulation ( EC) No. 726/2004 in enterprises and facilities which develop, manufacture, test or clinically inve stigate medicinal products. For this purpose, persons commissioned by the competent higher federa l authority, in consultation with the re- spective competent authorities, may enter the opera ting and business premises during usual business hours to inspect documents and request inf ormation. Moreover, in making a decision in respect of the marketing authorisation, the comp etent higher federal authority is also entitled to have the documents assessed by independent count er-experts and shall apply the results of their evaluation in deciding on the marketing autho risation and, in so far as medicinal products which are subject to mandatory prescription under S ection 48 sub-section 2 number 1 are con- cerned, as a basis for the draft of the marketing a uthorisation decision which is to be submitted to the marketing authorisation commission pursuant to sub-section 6 sentence 1. The compe- tent higher federal authority may commission, as a counter-expert pursuant to sentence 5, any person who possesses the requisite expert knowledge and the reliability required to do the work of a counter-expert. Upon request, the applica nt shall be permitted to peruse the expert opinions. If the applicant requires that experts be called in whom he himself selects, these per- sons shall also be heard. Sub-Section 6 sentences 5 and 6 shall apply mutatis mutandis for the appointment of experts and counter-experts. (5a) The competent higher federal authority shall also prepare an assessment report on the quality, safety and efficacy documents submitte d containing a statement on the findings of pharmaceutical and pre-clinical tests as well as cl inical trials and, for medicinal products for human use, also on the risk-management and on the p harmacovigilance system; in the case of medicinal products intended for use in food-produci ng animals, the assessment report shall also relate to the results of residue tests. The as sessment report should be updated if any new information becomes available. (5b) Sub-section 5a shall not apply to medicinal product s which have been manufac- tured according to homeopathic manufacturing proced ures in so far as these medicinal prod- ucts are subject to Article 16 paragraph 2 of Direc tive 2001/83/EC or Article 19 paragraph 2 of Directive 2001/82/EC. (6) Prior to the decision on the marketing authori sation of a medicinal product which is attributed to the phytotherapy, homeopathy or anthr oposophy schools of therapy and which is subject to prescription pursuant to Section 48 sub- section 2 number 1, a marketing authorisa- tion commission shall be consulted. The hearing sha ll cover the contents of the documents presented, the expert opinions, the expertises requ ested, the comments of the experts sum- moned, the result of the tests and the reasons whic h played an essential role in the decision - 85 - taken on the marketing authorisation or the assessm ent of the counter-experts. Should the higher federal authority diverge from the result of the hearing in deciding on the application, it shall set forth its reasons for doing so. The Feder al Ministry shall appoint the members of the marketing authorisation commission in agreement wit h the Federal Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Consumer Protection, in so far as medicina l products intended for administration to animals are concerned, taking into account the prop osals of the chambers of the medical pro- fessions, the professional societies of medical pra ctitioners, dentists, veterinarians, pharma- cists, alternative medical practitioners as well as the main central associations of the pharma- ceutical entrepreneurs, patients and consumers resp onsible for representing their interests. In appointing the commission's members, consideration shall be given to the individual peculiari- ties of the medicinal products. The experts to be a ppointed to the marketing authorisation commission shall be persons who possess scientific knowledge and have gained practical ex- perience in the specific therapeutic indications as well as in the school of therapy in question (phytotherapy, homeopathy, anthroposophy). (7) For medicinal products not subject to prescrip tion pursuant to Section 48 sub- section 2 number 1, commissions shall be set up for specific therapeutic indications or schools of therapy at the competent higher federal authorit y. Sub-section 6 sentences 4 to 6 shall apply mutatis mutandis. In preparing the decision regarding the prolongati on of marketing authorisa- tions pursuant to Section 105 sub-section 3 sentenc e 1, the competent higher federal authority may involve the competent commission. If the decisi on pursuant to sentence 3 affects medici- nal products from a specific school of therapy (phy totherapy, homeopathy, anthroposophy), the competent commission shall be involved if the inten tion is to refuse the prolongation pursuant to Section 105 sub-section 3 sentence 1 totally, or if the decision is of fundamental importance; the competent commission shall be afforded a period of two months in which to respond. In cases where the competent higher federal authority does not take the comments of the com- mission into account in making its decision under s entence 4, it shall set forth its reasons for not doing so. (7a) In order to improve the safety of medicinal p roducts for children and young people, a Commission on Medicinal Products intended for Chi ldren and Young People shall be set up at the Federal Institute for Drugs and Medical Devi ces. Sub-section 6 sentences 4 to 6 shall apply mutatis mutandis . In preparing the decision regarding an applicatio n for a marketing au- thorisation for a medicinal product which is also i ntended for use in children and young people, the competent higher federal authority shall involv e said commission. Furthermore, the compe- tent higher federal authority is entitled to involv e the commission when preparing a decision re- garding an application for a marketing authorisatio n of a medicinal product, other than that - 86 - specified in sentence 3, for which the administrati on to children or young people is envisaged. The commission has the opportunity to issue an opin ion. In cases where the competent higher federal authority does not take the commission's co mments into account in making its decision, it shall set forth its reasons. Furthermore, in the case of medicinal products which have not been authorised for administration to children and young people, the commission may estab- lish the prerequisites for their administration to children and young people in accordance with recognised scientific principles. In the case of me dicinal products from the phytotherapeutic, homeopathic and anthroposophic schools of medicine, the tasks and authority conferred by sentences 3 to 7 shall be assumed by the commission s pursuant to sub-section 7 sentence 4. (8) In the case of sera, vaccines, blood preparati ons, tissue preparations, allergens, xenogenic medicinal products, which are not medicin al products pursuant to Section 4 sub- section 9, the competent higher federal authority s hall grant the marketing authorisation either on the basis of an examination of the documents sub mitted, its own tests or based on observa- tion of the tests carried out by the manufacturer. For this purpose, persons commissioned by the competent higher federal authority, in consulta tion with the respective competent authori- ties, may enter the operating and business premises during usual business hours and carry out an inspection, both of said premises and of the com pany's transport facilities. At the request of the competent higher federal authority, the applica nt shall give information about the manufac- turing process. Sub-sections 6, 7 and 7a shall not apply to these medicinal products. (8a) Sub-section 8 sentences 1 to 3 shall apply mutatis mutandis to test methods pur- suant to Section 23 sub-section 2 sentence 3. (9) If an application is submitted for different s trengths, pharmaceutical forms, admini- stration routes or presentations of a medicinal pro duct, at the applicant's request, these can be the subject of a uniform comprehensive marketing au thorisation; this shall also apply to subse- quent amendments and extensions. This shall require a uniform authorisation number to which further codes must be added to allow differentiatio n between the different pharmaceutical forms or concentrations. For authorisations pursuan t to Section 24b sub-section 1, individual authorisations of a reference medicinal product sha ll be regarded as a uniform comprehensive authorisation. (10) The marketing authorisation shall be without prejudice to the pharmaceutical en- trepreneur's penal or civil liability. - 87 - Section 25a Prior examination (1) The competent higher federal authority can hav e the application for a marketing au- thorisation examined by independent experts to dete rmine whether it is complete and whether the medicinal product has been sufficiently tested according to the current, recognized state of scientific knowledge. Section 25 sub-section 6 sent ence 5 shall apply mutatis mutandis. (2) Should flaws within the meaning of sub-section 1 be identified, the expert shall grant the applicant an opportunity to correct such flaws within a period of three months.

Section 58c Determining the treatment frequency (1) For each enterprise that has been issued with a registration number in accordance with the animal health provisions on the handling o f livestock and the corresponding species of the animals being kept, taking into account the typ e of production, the competent authority shall ascertain, for each half-yearly period, the a verage number of treatments involving anti- bacterially active substances on the basis of the p rocedure for calculating treatment frequency of 21 st February 2013 (Federal Gazette AT 22.02.2013 B2), namely by: 1. multiplying the number of treated animals with the number of treatment days for each substance used and then adding together the resulti ng figures for all of the substances administered during the half-yearly period, and sub sequently 2. dividing the figure resulting from number 1 by t he average number of animals of the af- fected species that were kept during the half-yearl y period (half-yearly treatment frequency in enterprises). - 170 - (2) By no later than the end of the second month o f the half-yearly period that follows the notifications from the previous half-yearly per iod pursuant to Section 58b sub-section 1 sentence 1, the competent authority shall inform th e Federal Office of Consumer Protection and Food Safety, for the purposes of sub-section 4 and Section 77 sub-section 3 sentence 2, in anonymised form of the respective half-yearly tr eatment frequency ascertained pursuant to sub-section 1. In addition, the competent authority shall provide the Federal Institute for Risk Assessment, at the latter's request in each case, w ith the half-yearly therapy frequencies as- certained pursuant to sub-section 1, in anonymised form, together with the information listed in Section 58b sub-section 1 sentence 1 number 4, inso far as this is necessary for the Federal Institute for Risk Assessment to conduct a risk ass essment in the area of resistance to antibiot- ics. In accordance with Section 10 of the Data Prot ection Act, the notifications as required by sentences 1 and 2 may be made via an automated data retrieval procedure. (3) If the Laender establish a joint agency for th e purposes of sub-section 1, the infor- mation listed in Sections 58a and 58b is to be tran smitted to this agency. The agency shall then ascertain the half-yearly treatment frequency in enterprises in accordance with the proce- dure for calculating treatment frequency described in sub-section 1 and shall transmit this in- formation to the authorities mentioned in sub-secti on 2 sentences 1 and 2. Sub-section 2 sen- tence 3 shall apply mutatis mutandis . (4) From the data it receives on half-yearly treat ment frequency in enterprises, the Fed- eral Office for Consumer Protection and Food Safety shall ascertain: 1. as the first parameter, the median (the value be low which 50 per cent of all recorded half- yearly therapy frequencies fall), and 2. as the second parameter, the third quartile (the value below which 75 per cent of all re- corded half-yearly therapy frequencies fall) of the nationwide half-yearly treatment frequency f or each animal species referred to in Section 58a sub-section 1. The Federal Office of Consumer P rotection and Food Safety shall promul- gate these parameters in the Federal Gazette by the end of the third month of the half-yearly period following the notifications from the previou s half-yearly period pursuant to Section 58b sub-section 1, breaking them down according to type of production . (5) The competent authority or the joint agency pu rsuant to sub-section 3 shall inform the animal keeper of the half-yearly treatment freq uency ascertained pursuant to sub-section 1 - 171 - for each species of animal in his/her keeping withi n the meaning of Section 58a sub-section 1, taking into account the type of production. The ani mal keeper may also request information about the data which have been collected, saved or otherwise processed in accordance with Sections 58a and 58b, insofar as these data relate to his/her enterprise.

This period shall begin on the day follo wing 30 June or 31 December of the half-yearly period in wh ich the nationwide half-yearly treatment frequency was promulgated pursuant to sub-section 4 . Upon the expiry of this period, the data are to be deleted. Section 58d Reduction in treatment with antibacterially active substances (1) In order to contribute towards effectively red ucing the use of medicinal products con- taining antibacterially active substances, any pers on who keeps animals professionally or com- mercially within the meaning of Section 58a sub-sec tion 1 sentence 1 is: 1. to ascertain, two months after the data on the n ationwide half-yearly treatment frequency are promulgated pursuant to Section 58c sub-section 4 sentence 2, whether, in the ex- pired period, his/her enterprise's half-yearly trea tment frequency for the individual species of animals kept, taking into account the type of pr oduction, and in respect of the livestock enterprise for which a registration number has been issued to him/her in accordance with the animal health provisions on the handling of liv estock, is above parameter 1 or pa- rameter 2 of the nationwide half-yearly treatment f requency; 2. to record the ascertainment pursuant to number 1 in his/her company documentation without delay once it has been made. (2) If an animal keeper's half-yearly treatment fr equency, in respect of the livestock en- terprise for which a registration number was issued to him/her in accordance with the animal health provisions on the handling of livestock: 1. is above parameter 1 of the nationwide half-year ly treatment frequency, the animal keeper is to examine, by consulting a veterinarian, what reasons may have led to this pa- rameter being exceeded, and how the treatment of an imals kept by him /her within the - 172 - meaning of Section 58a sub-section 1 with medicinal products containing antibacterially active substances may be reduced; or 2. is above parameter 2 of the nationwide half-year ly treatment frequency, the animal keeper is to draw up a written plan, based on veter inary advice, within two months of the date established pursuant to sub-section 1 number 1 , containing measures that aim to reduce treatment with medicinal products containing antibacterially active substances. If the examination by the animal keeper pursuant t o sentence 1 number 1 indicates that the treatment with the medicinal products in questi on can be reduced, the animal keeper is to take steps which can lead to a reduction. The anima l keeper is to ensure that the animals re- ceive the necessary medicinal treatment while the m easure pursuant to sentence 1 number 1 and the steps listed in the plan pursuant to senten ce 1 number 2 are carried out. The plan pur- suant to sentence 1 number 2 is to be supplemented to include a time schedule if the meas- ures to be taken pursuant to the plan cannot be ful filled within six months. (3) The plan pursuant to sub-section 2 sentence 1 number 2 is to be submitted, unsolic- ited, to the competent authority, at the latest two months after the date established pursuant to sub-section 1 number 1. Insofar as is necessary for the effective reduction of treatment with medicinal products containing antibacterially activ e substances, the competent authority may, in respect of the animal keeper 1. issue an order that the plan be amended or suppl emented, 2. issue orders, taking into account the state of v eterinary science, to reduce treatment with medicinal products containing antibacterially activ e substances, in particular with regard to: a) compliance with generally recognised guidelines on the use of medicinal products containing antibacterially active substances, or pa rts thereof, and b) vaccination of the animals, 3. with regard to preventing diseases, and taking i nto account the state of good practice in agriculture or good hygienic practice in animal hus bandry, issue orders regarding the keeping of the animals, in particular with regard t o the feeding, the hygiene, the type and - 173 - manner of the fattening, including the length of th e fattening period, the equipping of the stalls, the fittings of the stalls and the stocking density, 4. issue an order that medicinal products containin g antibacterially active substances may, for a specified period, be used in a livestock ente rprise only by the veterinarian, if the half-yearly treatment frequency ascertained for the animal species held by an animal kee- per, taking into account the type of production, is considerably higher than parameter 2 of the nationwide treatment frequency twice in a row. The order issued pursuant to sentence 2 Number 1 mu st give the aim pursued by the amendment of or addition to the plan. Orders issued pursuant to sentence 2 numbers 2, 3 and 4 must ensure that the animals receive the necessar y medicinal treatment at all times. The competent authority may instruct the animal keeper to take measures pursuant to sentence 2 number 3 even if these measures revoke or limit rig hts granted to the animal keeper by other administrative acts or legislation, in so far as th e necessary reduction of treatment with medici- nal products containing antibacterially active subs tances cannot be achieved by means of other effective measures and the competent authority has actual findings on the effectiveness of the further measures. Sentence 5 shall not apply insofa r as directly applicable legal provisions of the European Community or of the European Union exi st to the contrary. (4) If the animal keeper has not complied with ord ers issued pursuant to sub-section 3 sentence 2 numbers 1 to 4 (in the case of number 3 also in conjunction with sentence 5), and if the half-yearly treatment frequency ascertained for the respective animal species kept by an animal keeper, taking into account the type of prod uction, is for this reason repeatedly above parameter 2 of the nationwide treatment frequency, the competent authority may order the sus- pension of animal husbandry in the animal keeper's enterprise for a specified period, up to a maximum of three years. The order to suspend the an imal husbandry is to be revoked as soon as it is ensured that the orders described in sente nce 1 are being complied with.
