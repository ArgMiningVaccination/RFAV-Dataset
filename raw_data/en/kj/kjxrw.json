Seepage2Golden Year of Infrastructure Construction SinceChang'e- 4probe'slanderand rovermadethefirst-eversoftlandingon the far side of the moon in January 2019, they have been hard at work on the lunar surface for more than three years. However, before the launch of Chang'e-4,thedesignedservicetimefor theYutu-2roverwasonly 3months.For- tunately, the efforts of scientists' mak - ing deliberate design and technological innovations have prolonged the rover's lifespan. Firstly, the spacecrafts were de - signed for high performance at the out - set of the project. Each component was selected to meet the high standards, to ensure a longevity and reliable perfor - mance, said Fu Qiang, chief designer of the Chang'e- 4mission ground applica -tionsystem. Secondly, the lander and rover were designed with enhanced radiation resistance. Due to the absence of a pro - tective layer on the moon, many space particlescanaffectspacecraftonthelu - nar surface. Better radiation resistance can protect spacecraft from damage, whichcannotonlyprolongtheirservice life, but also guarantee the accuracy of datacollected. Thirdly, scientists designed a \"nap\" mode and \"dormant\" mode for the spacecrafttobetteradapttomoontem - peratures, which can range from- 180 to160onthesurface,withatempera - turedifferencebetweendayandnightof morethan300degrees. Both vehicles must sleep when the sun is directly overhead to avoid over - heating. They also power down duringthe lunar night, when temperatures plummet to- 173, to avoid damaging theirinstruments. Lunar days and nights are both equivalent to 14days on Earth. From January15, Chang'e-4probe's lander and rover were switched to the dor - mant mode during the lunar night. Af - ter a break, it will start to work for the 39th lunar day. After 38lunar days' test, the work procedure of the space - crafts was proved to be reasonable, saidFu. Yutu-2is exploring Von Karman crater, where an ancient lunar impact may have exposed the moon's mantle. By studying this region directly, scien - tists will learn more about the early larsystemandtheEarth.Todate,Yutu- 2 hastraveledmorethan 1,000metersand obtainedmorethan 114trillionRMB, saidNingJizhe,CommissioneroftheNa - tionalBureauofStatisticsofChina,ata pressconferenceinBeijingonJanuary 17. Despite the ongoing impact of COVID-19, China's GDP growth exceed - ed the anticipated 6percent. \"In gener - al, China's economy has been recover - ing continuously and stably in 2021, with major indexes meeting the antici - patedtargets,\"saidNing. The uplift of China's economy also drovethegrowthoftheworldeconomy, with an estimated contribution rate of about25percent. Increased opening up has led to newbreakthroughs.In 2021,China'sto- talvolumeoftradeingoodssurpassed 6 trillion USD for the first time, showing the highest growth rate since 2011. The import and export volumes with coun - tries along the Belt and Road Initiative reached11.6trillion RMB. With 15,000trips, the number of the China-Europe freighttrainsroseby 22percent. One of the contributing factors for thegoodperformanceofChina'secono - my,accordingtoNing,wasthatthedriv - ing force of innovation was effectively strengthened. The total spending on re - searchanddevelopment(R&D)wentup by14.2percent, continuing the double- digit growth since the 13th Five-Year Planperiod.ThespendingonR&Dcom - prised2.44percent of China's GDP, and spending on basic research surged by 15.6percent compared with that of last year, making up 6.09percent of the to - talspendingonR&D.

However, every cloud has a silver lining. Afterdecadesofhardwork,Chinare - alized the eradication of extreme poverty and completed the first centenary goal of building a moderately prosperous society in all respects in 2021, which also contrib - uted to poverty elimination all over the world. Without having to worry about their basic needs, Chinese people are now enjoyingamuchbetterqualityoflife. We are also inspired by the sci-tech achievements made last year. Three of the notable were: China twice sending taikonauts to its own space station Tian - gong and conducting multiple space - walks; the successful development of the quantum computer prototypes \"Jiuzhang 2.0\" and \"Zuchongzhi 2.1\"; and Baihetan, the world's largest station under construction, beginning operation,and contributing to the country's green development. Along with the rest of the world, we have experienced the COVID- 19pandem- ic, which has been brought under control inChinabytheadoptionofadynamicze - ro-tolerance policy and more than 1.2bil- lion Chinese people being fully vaccinat - ed to date. China has also offered two bil - lion doses of COVID- 19vaccines to more than120countries and international or - ganizations, playing an important role in theglobalresponsetothepandemic. The shadow of COVID- 19is still there,along with many other challenges. But with what we have witnessed and the experience gained last year, we can look forward to building the future with confidence. The Spring Festival is drawing clos - er and it will be the Year of the Tiger. In Chinese culture, a tiger is considered the symbolofbraveryandstrength.By\"giving the tiger wings\" we will survive through this bitter winter and conquer the severe challenges that lay ahead, including COVID-19,together, and with certainty.

By2025,10percent of its GDP is expectedtocomefromtheaddedvalue of core digital industries, up from 7.8 percent in2020, according to a docu - ment released by the State Council on January12. The document, titled the Outline of the14th Five-Year Plan ( 2021-2025) for Digital Economy Development ,draws upthecountry'sroadmaptobuildadig - italpowerhouse. In recent years, the digital econo - my is booming in China, with signifi - cantprogressmadeininformationinfra - structure, digital transformation of in - dustries,andnewbusinessmodes. Today, China is the world's second largest digital economy in scale, and leads the world in many digital fields, such as5G, industrial Internet and e- commerce. The country is also the largest e- commerce market globally, generating almost50percent of the world's trans - actions. In2021, China's e-commerce market is predicted to be larger thanthe U.S., UK, Japan, Germany and Francecombined. And its potential is still enormous. By2025, China's e-commerce transac - tion scale is expected to rise to 46tril- lion RMB from 37.2trillion RMB in 2020,accordingtotheoutline. Thesoftwareandinformationtech -nologyserviceindustryisalsoexpected to grow from 8.16trillion RMB in 2020 to14trillionRMBin 2025. To achieve these goals, the outline puts forward a series of key tasks, in - cluding optimizing and upgrading digi - talinfrastructure,bringingdataelement intofullplay,andacceleratingdigitalin -dustrialization. Aiming to build a smart compre - hensive digital information infrastruc - ture, China will focus on areas such as gigabitbroadband, 5G,and6G. It anticipates the users of gigabit broadband to increase from 6.4million in2020to60millionin2025. Meanwhile, the country will pro - mote the commercial deployment and large-scaleapplicationof 5G. Other key areas such as core tech - nology innovation, elevating the digital level of public services and improving governance systems are greatly empha - sizedintheoutline. The outline also calls for expand - inginternationalcooperationonthedig - italeconomy,includingcross-borderda - ta flow, cross-border e-commerce, and governancecooperation.

Chuah received the Chinese Government Friendship Award in 2021 for his contributions to China's social development. He told Science and Technology Daily , \"Every award is a recognition, and in a way, it illustrates and recognizes the close relationship between China and Malaysia.\" Education as a family tradition Chuah is proud of his identity as an educator, having spent 33years searching for the essence of what it means to be a good educator. He suc - ceeded in achieving that goal, and his studentsrefertohimas\"araregemand atrue-blueeducator.\" When discussing the origins of his dream, he attributed it to the influence ofhisfamily.Hisparentsvaluededuca - tion and provided equal opportunities for their daughters and sons, although for many families the son had been moreprivilegedinyearsgoneby. \"We believe education is the most important asset that people can leave behind,\"hesaid,addingthatitisimpor - tant to pass the baton on to others to ensurecontinuedprogress.

The signing of the agreement was a significant milestone for engineers worldwide,inwhichthemembercoun - tries agreed to promote quality engi - neering education, training, and prac - tice, as well as mobility, leading to a largermarketfortheirservices. His previous working experiences taught him that the world is becoming smaller due to new technologies. \"It is time to establish an international stan - dard to facilitate global mobility among engineers,\" he said, further noting that this brings tangible benefits for coun - triesandengineers. In order to further implement the agreement, Chuah and his Chinese counterparts established a NPU-FEIAP Belt & Road Engineering EducationTraining Centre at NPU, which serves as a platform for training academic staff, policy makers and industry play - ersfromallthemembereconomies,not just those from China, but also those fromAsia,thePacificandAfrica. High-quality cooperation Chuah has a strong belief in the role of international cooperation and has highlighted ways to increase high- quality people- to- people exchanges basedonhisyearsofexperience.

(COURTESYPHOTO)I am a citizen of Nepal and have been in China since 2010, working at the Northwestern Polytechnical Univer - sity for the past four years, and would like to share some of my academic and lifeexperiencesinChinawithyou. As per QS World University Rank - ings2022, China is home to many world- renowned universities. Chinese universitiesencouragecreativityandin - dependent thinking. Being a lecturer, and teaching students of almost all lev - elsattheSchoolofManagement,Imust saythatChinesestudentsareveryconfi - dent in their own judgments, willing to ask questions and challenge other pointsofview. Moreover, students are also given the chance to study abroad through some exchange programs. In this way Chinese students are exposed to differ - ent cultures and backgrounds. That is why the academic environment in Chinaisgainingagreatreputation. Chinahadmorethan 2.1millionre- searchersin2019,anincreaseof 13per- cent compared with 2018. China is also becoming a hub for sci-tech talent at homeandabroad. The first benefit of doing research in China is that the country is working to de-emphasize researchers who pub - lish a lot of papers and to find new waystoassesstheimpactoftheirwork. Asaresult,China'sshareofthetopone percent most cited science publications has been growing faster than its share of total publications, a clear indication that the quality of the country's basic scientificresearchisrapidlyimproving. According to King's College Lon - don, China is set to overtake the U.S. to become the world's biggest spender on R&D and one of the most signifi - cant research partners in the world. This is another benefit of doing re - search in China. The country has be - come a popular research destination for many students from the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) countries, the GlobalSouthandbeyond. Moreover, China is generally more bilateral in its international co-author - ship than other large countries. Around three-quartersofitsrecentpapersco-au - thoredwiththeU.S.arebilateral,asare about60percentofpaperswithCanada and Australia, while 40percent of its collaborative papers with Germany and France are solely bilateral. The mission of NSFC, a mainly basic-research foun - dation in China, is to be a \"friend\" of scientists, including giving fair reviews, rewardingresearch,internationalpartic -ipation, efficient management, large numberofgrants,anddiversedisciplin - arycoverage.

His outstanding contributions have left a lasting influence on China's science and technology development. The United Nations Astronomical Orga - nization named a crater on the back of themoon\"ZhangHengCrater\"andthe asteroid1802in the solar system \"ZhangHengStar\"inhishonor. Zhang was credited with inventing the world's first earthquake detection device\u2014Houfeng Didong Yi, meaning \"an instrument for measuring the sea - sonal winds and the movements of the Earth.\" Zhang believed that an earth - quake was caused by winds and chang - es in air pressure, a lot earlier than the plate tectonic theory appeared in the early20thcentury. Although there are no surviving physical remains or illustrations ofZhang Heng's seismoscope device, it was, according to historical descrip - tions, a large bronze instrument resem - blinganurnorvaseinshape.
