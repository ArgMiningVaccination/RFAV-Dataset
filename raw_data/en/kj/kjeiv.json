This is what it tells you about Reiki: Reiki is a form of paranormal or energy healing popularised by Japanese Mikao Usui (1865-1926). Rei means universal spirit (sometimes thought of as a supreme being) and ki is the assumed universal life energy. - - Reiki is based on the assumptions of Traditional Chinese Medicine and the existence of 'chi', the life-force that determines our health. - Reiki practitioners believe that, with their hands-on healing method, they can transfer 'healing energy' to a patient which, in turn, stimulates the self-healing properties of the body. They assume that the therapeutic effects of this technique are obtained from a 'universal life energy' that provides strength, harmony, and balance to the body and mind. - There is no scientific basis for such notions, and reiki is therefore not plausible. - Reiki is used for a number of conditions, including the relief of stress, tension and pain. - There have been several clinical trials testing the effectiveness of reiki. Unfortunately, their methodological quality is usually poor. - A systematic review summarising this evidence concluded that the evidence is insufcient to suggest that reiki is an effective treatment for any condition. Therefore, the value of reiki remains unproven.

Some practitioners advise caution about using reiki in people with psychiatric illnesses because of the risk of bringing out underlying psychopathology. | | PLAUSIBILITY | | Negative | | EFFICACY | | Negative | | SAFETY | | Positive | | COST | | Positive | | RISK/BENEFIT BALANCE | | Negative [[1]](https://d.docs.live.net/72b3711d37d5b850/Alternative%20Medicine%20a%20critical%20evaluation%20of%20150%20modalities/PART%202/CHAPTER%2010%20OTHER%20THERAPIES/REIKI.docx#_ftnref1) [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=lee+pittler+ernst%2C+reikiv](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=lee+pittler+ernst%2C+reikiv) [[2]](https://d.docs.live.net/72b3711d37d5b850/Alternative%20Medicine%20a%20critical%20evaluation%20of%20150%20modalities/PART%202/CHAPTER%2010%20OTHER%20THERAPIES/REIKI.docx#_ftnref2) [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25835541](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25835541) So, Reiki is both implausible and unproven. Now a new, large trial has emerged that might change this verdict. The main purpose of this [study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31638407) (published in [JCAM](https://edzardernst.com/2017/10/john-weeks-admitted-to-the-alt-med-hall-of-fame/)) was to measure the effect of a single session of Reiki on physical and psychological health in a large nonclinical sample. The study design was a single arm effectiveness trial with measures at pre-and postintervention. The study took place at private Reiki practices across the United States. Reiki practitioners were recruited from an online mailing list to participate in the study with their Reiki clients. A total of 99 Reiki practitioners met the inclusion criteria and participated in the study. Reiki practitioners were instructed to give a flyer to each of their Reiki clients that contained information about the study and invited the client to complete a survey before and after their Reiki session. Trained and certified Reiki Masters conducted the Reiki sessions in person, with each session lasting between 45 and 90 min. The 20-item Positive and Negative Affect Schedule was used to assess affect, and brief, single-item self-report measures were used to assess a wide range of physical and psychological variables immediately before (pre) and after (post) the Reiki session. A total of N = 1411 Reiki sessions were conducted and included in the analysis. Statistically significant improvements were observed for all outcome measures, including positive affect, negative affect, pain, drowsiness, tiredness, nausea, appetite, shortness of breath, anxiety, depression, and overall well-being (all p-values <0.001). The authors concluded that the results from this large-scale multisite effectiveness trial suggest that a single session of Reiki improves multiple variables related to physical and psychological health. Really? This 'large scale' effectiveness trial' could make you laugh and cry at the same time. - Laugh, because it is almost comically daft. - Cry, because the conclusion is bound to mislead a lot of gullible people. Without a control group, the study cannot even attempt to determine anything like the effectiveness of Reiki. What the results truly show is that consumers who consult (and pay) a Reiki master expect to have a positive effect. The expectation translates into a sizable placebo response. The investigators seem to be clueless scientists, or they wilfully mislead the public (the senior author is from the ' [The Center for Reiki Research](https://www.centerforreikiresearch.org/MissionStatement.aspx)' which, according to its mission statement, is dedicated to gaining acceptance for the practice of Reiki by the medical community). The only conclusion that can honestly be drawn from the data is that consumers who pay for a serivce often like this service (otherwise they would not use it!). It's a bit like the thing with the hamburger joint that I often cite: if you ask people eating in a McDonalds whether they enjoy hamburgers, most will answer in the affirmative. But there might be a valuable lesson in this paper after all: never trust the [JACM](https://edzardernst.com/2017/10/john-weeks-admitted-to-the-alt-med-hall-of-fame/) further than you can throw it. "}
