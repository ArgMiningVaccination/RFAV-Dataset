AmiClear may work by regulating your blood sugar levels, enhancing insulin sensitivity, and promoting glucose uptake into your body's cells.

Guarana contains compounds that may help stimulate insulin production, making your body more sensitive to this essential hormone. This increased sensitivity allows for better regulation of blood sugar levels and prevents spikes or crashes. Another powerful ingredient found in AmiClear is grape seeds. Grape seeds contain antioxidants called proanthocyanidins, showing blood sugar-lowering effects. These antioxidants may improve insulin function and reduce inflammation, improving blood sugar control. Gymnema is yet another vital component of AmiClear. This herb known as a traditional medicine for centuries because it reduces cravings for sweet foods and balances blood sugar levels. Gymnema works by blocking the taste receptors responsible for detecting sweetness on our tongues, thus reducing our desire for sugary treats.
