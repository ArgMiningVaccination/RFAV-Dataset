They often need you to take an active part in your own treatment with lifestyle changes (e.g. diet, exercise, meditation or psychological exercises). They are diverse in nature and origins. The ways in which these therapies are thought to work are also diverse, although many are based on the idea of enabling your body's ability to heal itself. Medical treatments mainly focus on understanding and correcting the underlying problems that are causing your symptoms. In many instances these aren't fully understood, although there have been major advances in recent years in general medicine. Medical treatments are often criticised for treating the condition and not the person, expecting you to accept the diagnosis and treatment. It is important to increasingly recognise your involvement and choice in treatment, and many argue this is due to the influence of natural therapies. Both types of treatment emphasise the quality of the relationship between you and the practitioner. A good relationship is important for a successful outcome. Often, both natural therapies and medical treatment approaches are used, this is called integrated medicine. "}
