On the Cover If one had to imagine the best thing that could happen to a young uni\u00ad versity, it would be exactly what happened to UCI on October II, 1995. Nobel Prizes in physics and chemistry were awarded to two UCI faculty members, a feat that has never been achieved in the same year through\u00ad out the history of the UC system, and is quite rare in the history of the Nobel Prize. The honors were long overdue for Frederick Reines and F. Sherwood Rowland , two of UCI's-and the nation 's-most accomplished scientists . -Chancellor Laurel L.

UC IRVINE - 1996-1997THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA Richard C. Atkinson, President The University of California was chartered as the State's only Land Grant College in 1868. Throughout its first decades, the University's development was strongly influenced by leading edu\u00ad cators and scholars from various parts of the country. Supported by the State and many generous benefactors, the University was responsive to the needs of California while progressing on a steady climb toward eminence in academic and scientific achievement. Today the University system includes nine campuses: Berkeley, Davis, Irvine, Los Angeles, Riverside, San Diego, San Francisco, Santa Barbara, and Santa Cruz. All of the campuses adhere to the same admissions guidelines and high academic standards, yet each one has its own distinct character. Among the campuses there arc five medical schools, three law schools, and a school of veterinary medicine, as well as professional schools of business administra\u00ad tion, education, engineering, oceanography, and many others. The University's libraries are among the finest in the United States; the collections of the more than I 00 University of California libraries on the nine campuses are surpassed in size on the American conti\u00ad nent only by the Library of Congress collection. The University is one of the world's largest and most renowned centers of higher education. The faculty is internationally noted for its distinguished academic achievements. On its nine campuses, the University has a total of 19 Nobel laureates. National Academy of Sciences membership on all campuses numbers 252, greater than any other college or university system. The University maintains a variety of research facilities, agricul\u00ad tural field stations, and extension centers in more than 100 loca\u00ad tions throughout California. Public services include medical and dental clinics, information services for agricultural and urban pop\u00ad ulations, and a broad program of continuing education for adults in the arts, business, and professions. Under contract with the U.S. Department of Energy, the University operates three national research facilities: the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory adjoining the Berkeley campus; the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory at Livermore, California; and the Los Alamos National Laboratory at Los Alamos, New Mexico. Other major research facilities include Lick Observatory, White Mountain Research Station for high-altitude research, Laboratory of Radio Astronomy, Bodega Marine Laboratory, Scripps Institu\u00ad tion of Oceanography, Institute of Transportation Studies, State\u00ad wide Air Pollution Research Center, Space Sciences Laboratory, Hormone Research Center, and Philip L. Boyd Deep Canyon Desert Research Center, among others. One of the University's unique resources is its roster of University Professors. The University Professor title is reserved for certain distinguished faculty members who are recognized nationally and internationally as scholars and teachers of exceptional ability. A University Professor may visit a number of University of Califor\u00ad nia campuses during the academic year, holding conferences with students and staff and speaking before general public audiences. A list of University Professors may be found in the Appendix. Governance. Under the State constitution, governance of the Uni\u00ad versity is entrusted to the Board of Regents. The Regents appoint the President of the University, and with the President's advice, the officers of the University. Among these are the Vice Presidents, the Chancellors, and the Directors of the major laboratories. The Regents also directly appoint the principal officers of the Regents: the General Counsel, the Treasurer, and the Secretary. Authority in academic matters is delegated by the Regents to the Academic Senate, which consists of faculty and certain administra\u00ad tive officers. The Academic Senate determines academic policy for the University as a whole, sets conditions for admission and the granting of degrees, authorizes and supervises courses and curric\u00ad ula, and advises the University administration on faculty appoint\u00ad ments, promotions, and budgets. Students participate in policy-making at both the campus and Uni\u00ad versitywide levels. The Board of Regents includes seven ex officio board members, and 18 regular members who are appointed by the Governor for 12-year terms after consultation with an advisory committee. In addition, The Regents appoint a student Regent for a one-year term as a voting Board member with full rights of participation. The Chair and Vice Chair of the Academic Council serve as faculty representatives to the Board and participate fully in all discussions. A constitutional amendment provides that \"Regents shall be able persons broadly reflective of the economic, cultural, and social diversity of the State, including ethnic minorities and women.\" They shall have \"full powers of organization and government, sub\u00ad ject only to such legislative controls as may be necessary to ensure compliance with the terms of the endowments of the University and the security of its funds.\" The President is executive head of the total institution. Each of the nine campuses has a Chancellor as its chief administrative officer. The Chancellor is responsible for the organization and operation of the campus, including academic, student, and business affairs. The names of University Regents, Officers, and Chancellors are pre\u00ad sented in the Appendix. THE IRVINE CAMPUS Laurel L. Wilkening, Chancellor The University of California, Irvine (UCI) opened in 1965 with 116 faculty and I ,589 students. In the succeeding 31 years, UCI has attained national and international distinction in its programs and faculty. The campus challenges its students both academically and personally and relics on the commitment, curiosity, imagina\u00ad tion, and judgment of its faculty and students to assure its contin\u00ad ued intellectual and cultural vitality. UCI is among the leading research universities in the United States. In 1994-95, UCI received more than $126 million from federal and state agencies and private organizations for the support of the teaching, research, and public service missions of the Uni\u00ad versity. Research is an integral part of all schools and departments, and many of UCI's research programs have achieved national and international distinction for their work. The research programs at UCI have a positive impact on both undergraduate and graduate education. Research is critical to grad\u00ad uate education because of the research-oriented nature of doctoral study. At the undergraduate level, research at UCI provides under\u00ad graduate students with access to \u00b7a faculty made up of researchers at the forefront of their fields. As a consequence, the knowledge received by UCI students is the most up-to-date available. UCJ is committed to the pursuit and transmission of knowledge. It makes available to its 17,280 students (13,830 undergraduate, 2,280 graduate, and I, 170 health sciences students and medical residents) opportunities for gaining knowledge, training, skills, UC IRVINE - 1996-1997FROM THE CHANCELLOR Dear Colleagues: Welcome to UCI. It is my pleasure to introduce you to a campus of great achievements. In its short history UCI has emerged as a major research university with many innovative aca\u00ad demic programs. As part of the largest public university system acclaimed throughout the world for its teaching, research, and public service excellence, UCI is that rarely found mix\u00ad ture of youth and experience, wisdom and innovation. Those qualities are serving us well as we head into a new century and a new era of achievement for UCI. In 1994 we set the goal to be ranked among the top 50 universities in the country by the year 2000. To my great pleasure, 20 of our 24 ranked Ph.D. programs placed well within the top 50. And the 1995 awarding of two Nobel Prizes to founding faculty members in Physics and Chemistry has never before happened at a public university. These achievements have propelled us inexorably toward the top 30. The reason is clear. This campus has managed to achieve a remarkable excellence among our scientific, humanistic, and cultural treasures. Virtually every school is distinguished for its faculty and its achievements. How have we arrived at such an enviable position for a campus barely three decades old? It stems from the foresight of UCI's founders. They recruited talented young faculty who advanced the educational goals of this growing university. In so doing, our faculty have become national leaders by shaping new ideas and revolutionizing our knowledge of the world. Following this tradition, we continue to recruit young promising faculty who com\u00ad plement the wisdom and experience of our prominent researchers and teachers. In this edition of the General Catalogue, we honor not only our Nobel Laureates, but also the recipients of the 1995-96 UCI Academic Senate Distinguished Faculty Awards. Our Nobel Laureates are featured on the next two pages, followed on pages 14-19 by messages from some of our outstanding faculty. So what does this mean to those of you who commit to a UCI education? It means the com\u00ad mitment to excellence I mentioned earlier. UCI attracts some of the brightest students in the country, who come to us full of potential. We are committed to a quality undergraduate experience and offer our students every opportunity to fulfill the goals they have set for themselves. Our students are succeeding because the university has made education-the growth and dissemination of knowledge-the center of our universe. In choosing UCI you have begun an educational journey toward the global society of the twenty-first century. I look forward to the exciting, rewarding moments ahead as we make that journey together. Sincerely yours, Laurel L. Wilkening Chancellor 5 UC IRVINE - 1996-19971995 NOBEL LAUREATE IN PHYSICS FREDERICK REINES UCI Distinguished Professor Emeritus of Physics The 1995 Nobel Prize in Physics was awarded to Frederick Reines \"for the detection of the neutrino,\" a feat that Reines achieved in the mid-1950s together with his Los Alamos Scien\u00ad tific Laboratory colleague, Clyde Cowan. The neutrino had been postulated by Wolfgang Pauli, over 20 years earlier, as a means of preserving fundamental conservation laws in radioactive decays of nuclei, in particular, the conservation of energy and angular momen\u00ad tum. Enrico Fermi suggested the name \"neutrino\" (i.e., \"little neutral one\"), to distinguish it from the neutron, and formulated a successful theory of weak nuclear processes with the neutrino as a central participant. The neutrino was postulated to have no electric charge and no (or very little) mass, and was predicted to be able to penetrate vast distances through matter without undergoing collisions. This made the prospect of actually detecting the elu\u00ad sive particle much too remote for most physicists to contemplate. There the matter stood until Reines and Cowan, starting at a nuclear reactor in Hanford, Washington, and later moving to the new Savannah River Plant reactor in South Carolina, performed their definitive and ground-breaking experimental detection. In addition to resolving and clarifying the highly unsatisfactory status of a fundamental particle which was needed for the consistency of theory, but which was virtually unobservable, this feat also demonstrated the possibility and practicality of doing \"neutrino physics,\" thus opening the door to the use of neutrinos as a sensitive probe of elementary particles. Indeed, a few years after the seminal work of Reines and Cowan, physicists began to use neutrinos regularly to investigate the weak interactions, the structure of protons and neu\u00ad trons and the properties of their constituent quarks. These investigations have used accelera\u00ad tor-produced neutrinos, as well as the reactor and cosmic ray neutrinos which Reines con\u00ad tinued successfully to use. Following the first detection, Reines' extraordinarily productive career became firmly iden\u00ad tified with neutrino physics, as he proceeded to devote the major part of his research to the understanding of the neutrino's properties and its interactions. His studies produced many fundamental findings and \"firsts,\" including the first detection of neutrinos from a super\u00ad nova, which occurred in 1987, confirming the central role played by neutrinos in stellar processes. The latter observation is considered to have signaled the birth of a new field, \"neutrino astronomy.\" Reines received his undergraduate degree (M.E.) in engineering (1939) and his M.S. degree in mathematical physics (1941) at the Stevens Institute of Technology, and his Ph.D. degree in theoretical physics (1944) at New York University. Even before completing the writing of his dissertation, he was recruited as a staff member in the Theoretical Division at Los Alamos to work on the Manhattan Project. About a year after he arrived he became a group leader iii the Theoretical Division and, later, the director of Operation Greenhouse, which consisted of experiments on Eniwetok atoll. In 1958 he was a delegate to the Atoms for Peace conference in Geneva. He left Los Alamos in 1959 to become Professor and Head of the Department of Physics of the Case Institute of Technology, where he formed his \"Neu\u00ad trino Group.\" In 1966 he came to UCI as the first Dean of Physical Sciences, bringing his Neutrino Group with him. Reines' distinguished career has been recognized by his peers. He is a member of the National Academy of Sciences, a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and a Foreign Member of the Russian Academy of Sciences. He has been a Guggenheim Fellow, an Alfred P. Sloan Fellow, and has won the J. Robert Oppenheimer Memorial Prize, the Michelson-Morley Award, the Franklin Medal, the W.K.H. Panofsky Prize, and the National Medal of Science, in addition to a host of other awards, prizes, and distinguished lectureships. UC IRVINE - 1996-19971995 NOBEL LAUREATE IN CHEMISTRY F. SHERWOOD ROWLAND Bren Research Professor of Chemistry and Earth System Science F. Sherwood Rowland was awarded the 1995 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for his work in atmospheric chemistry, particularly concerning the formation and decomposition of ozone. Rowland shares the prize with former UCI colleague Mario Molina, who is a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and Paul Crutzen, a professor at the Max-Planck\u00ad Institute for Chemistry in Germany and an adjunct professor at UC San Diego's Scripps Institution of Oceanography. The Nobel Committee praised the three researchers for \"con\u00ad tributing to our salvation from a global environmental problem that could have catastrophic consequences.\" Rowland and Molina published a landmark report in 1974 that described the threat to the ozone layer from chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) gases used in aerosol spray cans, refrigerators, and plastic foams. In the late 1970s their work led to a ban on the use of CFCs in aerosol cans in the United States, Canada, and Scandinavia. In 1987 the United Nations created an international protocol on the protection of the ozone layer. Under the most recent tightening of the protocol, the most dangerous ozone-destroy\u00ad ing gases have been totally banned from 1996 forward. The ozone layer should gradually begin to heal after the turn of the century, but the healing process will require most of the twenty-first century. Rowland received his B.A. degree from Ohio Wesleyan University in 1948, and his M.S. and Ph.D. degrees from the University of Chicago in 1951 and 1952, respectively, under the direction of Willard Libby. His work at this time involved carbon-dating. In 1964 Rowland came to UCI as the first Chair of the Department of Chemistry. His work here began in the area of chemical reaction kinetics, and he is now involved in many studies concerned with the concentrations of trace gases in the upper atmosphere. Rowland's investigation of the impact of methane gas on the atmosphere has shown that the atmospheric concentrations have been increasing steadily at about one percent per year since 1978. The excess release of methane is contributing to the \"greenhouse effect,\" the gradual warming of the earth's surface. Rowland is a member of the National Academy of Sciences, the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, the American Association for the Advancement of Science, and the American Philosophical Society. From 1982 to 1984 he served on a White House committee to evalu\u00ad ate the problem of acid rain. Rowland's many awards include the prestigious Japan Prize in Environmental Science and Technology received in 1989. In 1992 he served as President of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, and since 1994 he has been the Foreign Secretary of the National Academy of Sciences. UC IRVINE - 1996-19978 UCI 1996-97 Introduction and credentials which in turn can provide the basis for enhanced social and economic opportunities. With regard to making these opportunities available to all students, UCI takes very seriously its responsibility to establish and implement programs that go beyond legal minimums to ensure that all qualified segments of the public have access and equal opportunity to participate in its academic programs. UCI's education and research missions are fulfilled in its schools, departments, and programs, which are described briefly below, and in its formal research units, which are described in the Research and Graduate Studies section. The School of the Arts teaches the creative as well as the acade\u00ad mic and critical dimensions of the arts. It is concerned with the vitality of the arts in society. Faculty energies are directed toward the refinement, enhancement, and encouragement of students' artis\u00ad tic and creative talents and toward the development of the stu\u00ad dents' understanding of related theory and history. The School offers programs which emphasize extensive studio and workshop experiences, essential theoretical and historical background studies, and exercises in criticism. There are 610 students in the School, including 510 undergraduate and 100 graduate. The School of Biological Sciences is one of the campus' larger academic units, with 3,600 students (3,410 undergraduate and 190 graduate).

In addition, the Executive M.B.A. Program, the Health Care Executive M.B.A. Program, and the Fully Employed M.B.A. Program have a total of 290 students. The School of Physical Sciences has a student body of I ,260 (970 undergraduate and 290 graduate). Researchers in the School are conducting investigations in atmospheric chemistry (including the discovery of the adverse impact of manmade chlorofluorocarbon compounds on the earth's ozone layer), biogeochemistry and cli\u00ad mate, synthetic chemistry, laser spectroscopy, elementary particle physics (including the discoveries of a new subatomic particle\u00ad the neutrino-and a rare subatomic event-the double beta decay), plasma physics, and applied mathematics and mathematical physics. The School of Social Ecology, a multidisciplinary unit established in 1970, is unique to UCI. The School's central objectives are the application of scientific methods to the analysis and resolution of societal problems and the development of theory and knowledge pertinent to environmental and social phenomena. Among issues of long-standing interest are crime and justice in society, social influ\u00ad ences on human development over the life cycle, and the effects of the physical environment on health and behavior. There are 1,770 students in the School, including 1,650 undergraduate and 120 graduate. The School of Social Sciences, with 2,830 students (2,600 under\u00ad graduate and 230 graduate), is one of the larger academic units at UCI. The faculty, several of whom are nationally recognized, has expertise in a wide range of specific social science topics, for example, the mathematical modeling of perception and cognitive processes; the economic analysis of transportation; the examination of the impact of society's political system on its economy; the study of social structure and values in different cultures through a formal-scientific methodology; and the exploration of authority structures and inequality in society. The UCI College of Medicine has 1,170 students (390 medical, 660 resident-physicians and fellows, and 120 graduate). It offers one of the country's largest residency training programs in primary care and internal medicine and houses some of the most advanced equipment in medical imaging and laser medicine available in the world (including a positron emission tomography scanner and an UC IRVINE - 1996-1997ultrasound microscope, which is one of only two such machines in the U.S. and the only one used in biomedical research). The Col\u00ad lege's faculty conduct innovative research in the following areas of emphasis: bioethics, biomolecular structure, oncology, cardiovascu- geriatric medicine, immunology, mole\u00ad cular and human genetics, the neurosciences, and perinatology. Academic Goals UCI offers programs designed to provide students with a founda\u00ad tion on which to continue developing their intellectual, aesthetic, and moral capacities. Programs and curricula are based on the belief that a student's collective University experience should pro\u00ad vide understanding and insight which are the basis for an intellec\u00ad tual identity and lifelong learning. An important aspect of the educational approach at UCI is the emphasis placed on student involvement in independent study, research, and the creative process as a complement to classroom study. Independent research in laboratories, field study, involvement in writing workshops, and participation in fine arts productions are normal elements of the UCI experience. In many departments spe\u00ad cial programs and courses which involve students in original research and creative activities are integrated into the curriculum. UCI provides an atmosphere conducive to creative work and scholar\u00ad ship at all levels, to the exploration of the accumulated knowledge of humanity, and to the development of new knowledge through basic and applied research. Along with these objectives, UCI has a serious commitment to public service. The campus generates research expertise which may be applied to regional and national social issues, and seeks to provide humanistic understanding of the problems of society. Academic Structure Instruction and research programs at UCI focus on fundamental areas of knowledge, and at the same time provide for interdiscipli\u00ad nary and professional study. The academic units are the School of the Arts, School of Biological Sciences, Department of Education, School of Engineering, School of Humanities, Department of Information and Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Programs, Graduate School of Management, School of Physical Sciences, School of Social Ecology, School of Social Scie11ces, and the Col\u00ad lege of Medicine.

In my research I focus on under\u00ad standing the inner coherence of the traditional system of thought which was ultimately overthrown in the seventeenth century, but which thrived for over 2,000 years. Grounded in ancient texts like those of Aristotle and Pliny, this traditional natural philosophy provided explanations of the natural world that \"worked\" across many centuries and were transmitted for generations with subtle variations and adaptations. Why, then, fairly suddenly, did radi\u00ad cally new conceptions of nature and scientific method emerge-those which ultimately led to important modem developments? This question has fascinated historians since the emer\u00ad gence of the discipline of the history of science early in this century. I try to approach it from a new angle, by looking at the survival and reactions of the \"losing\" side, in which, inevitably, all the proponents for modem science and their audiences were initially trained. These research interests shape my teaching at all levels. In using mostly primary sources as reading assignments, I encourage students to set aside their modem assumptions (about science, or politics, or the past) in order to take seriously the often quite different categories and presuppositions that prevailed at a particular time and place. As in my research, I emphasize in my courses the role of unexpected consequences in shaping historical develop\u00ad ments in order to shed the notion that historical developments were inevitable, as they sometimes seem from the vantage point of the present day. Above all, I try to share my enthusiasm for analyzing all kinds of historical sources, from rare printed books to old scientific instruments, from manuscripts in the archives to works of art, for what they tell us, each in different ways, about how the world made sense to Europeans of the early modem period. Professor Blair, a UC1 faculty member since 1993, has recently accepted a position at Harvard University. MICHAEL BUTLER Professor Emeritus of Social Sciences Former Dean of Undergraduate Studies Director of the Farm School Daniel G. Aldrich Jr. Distinguished University Service Award, 1995 Creative activity and its cross-links with teaching are resonant themes for me. At UCI I have been a professor and administrator, but on the side I've led another, wholly unexpected life: directing an experimental elementary school in the University for over 25 years. The philosophy that animates the school grew out of reflection strongly shaped by studying, teaching, and working in research universities, most notably this one. In the late 1960s I was a very junior professor, and although I had long been fascinated by the act of learning, UCI was the first place I taught. Among other things I taught mathematics. UC IRVINE - 1996-1997DISTINGUISHED FACULTY The experience was immensely rewarding but unsettling. I thought of math as beautiful, richly ordered, and fun. Most of my students in those required courses appeared to think of it, at least at first, as arbitrary, impenetrable, incoherent and dull; some of them found it scary. A few students happily explored the distribution of a sample statistic, for example, pushing and pulling at it to see how it worked, but they were regarded as having a peculiar knack. There was no shame in not having it; that was just the luck of the genetic draw. Or did the attitude of the others toward math have to do with the way they had been edu\u00ad cated? Their reports of their pre-college math study matched what I found when I started visiting elementary and high schools and reading texts of that era: my students had been spending most of their time memorizing calculation recipes and learning to run them more or, often, less well. But that wasn't at all what the kind of people who had discovered the math did. Mathematicians look for and find patterns in formal objects, extend them, seek counter-examples, figure out why the patterns work, and then, finally, publish a convention\u00ad ally constrained account of one way that they work. The last is the public part, but the rest is what they do. Almost none of my undergraduate students seemed to have had much expe\u00ad rience with that. There was an odd disjunction between what practitioners did and what we asked students to do, a disjunction that was deeper and odder the more you looked at it. It was as though we had plucked the fruit \"mathematics\" for use in schools, peeled it, and fed students the rind instead of the flesh. Much the same thing seemed to be true in other areas. What working historians did, for example, or scientists, was rarely much like what schoolchildren did, so it wasn't surprising that undergraduates found it hard to think that way when asked. Again, it was as though we had discovered what it was that delighted practitioners, that drew them to their discipline\u00ad and in fact kept it a discipline, a thing that people were willing to spend their lives in, over generations-and having found these sources of delight in practice, we threw them away and taught the residue. So we and the times and UCI being young, and there being some farmhouses available on the edge of the campus, some of us made a schoolto redress these wrongs. We wanted a school where children would learn to do what finders and makers do, not just master more or less badly and mechanically some scattered things they have worked out. The students would ideally acquire some of the skills and habits of mind of mathematicians and histori\u00ad ans and writers and scientists and artists-even learn to do what good thinkers do when they are thinking well, independent of a particular practice; and they would learn to find matter of interest in and around themselves, and to develop and sustain those interests, as creators of new art and knowledge must do. These were not the only aims of the School, called the Farm School, but they were central. We are older now, but the School, and children, and the promise that comes from being in a university, where people explore as a deep part of their lives, are all still there. 15 UC IRVINE - 1996-199716 UCI 1996-97 Distinguished Faculty JULIA REINHARD LUPTON Associate Professor of English and Comparative Literature Presidential Award for Excellence in Undergraduate Research, 1995 (Faculty-member recipient) I'm a scholar of the Renaissance ( 1300-1600), a period of \"discovery\" -not so much the invention of new things as the uncovering of old ones, in particular, the great poems, statues, and philosophies of ancient Greece and Rome. In some cases, this process of \"dis-covering\" involved the actual excavation of statues, manuscripts, or buildings from centuries of medieval debris and neglect. Yet much of Renaissance discovery entailed not the actual retrieval of lost works so much as a change in perception toward extant ones. Renaissance \"discovery\" entailed a new respect and appetite for objects from a past era, a pagan rather than Christian culture in which the human mind, the human body, and the natural world were seen as objects of beauty, intrinsic worth, and potential knowledge. It is not enough to teach my students about this historic moment of discovery; I also need to produce the act and attitude of discovery in them. My students need to experience the same combination of historical awe and creative passion for a past world that led Renaissance poets, humanists, and artists to struggle to understand classical antiquity, and to reconstruct it in the landscapes and libraries of their present reality. I need to communicate the vitality of the classical heritage as a living body of stories, images, and paradigms that continue to inform the present, from the Shakespeare allusions that still enliven the dialogue of movies and television shows, to the humanist ideal of equality under law embodied in the United States Constitution, to the troubling complicity between classic civic virtues and imperial\u00ad ism that links the ancient world to contemporary politics. As a lecturer in the Humanities Core Course, I introduce students to classics of Western civilization in relation to an urgent contemporary issue or theme. In this way, freshmen can \"discover\" the continued impact of these master works on the texture of the world in which they live. In my more advanced undergraduate classes, students encounter classical and Renaissance works in their historical unfolding, so that they can \"discover\" how traditions come into being-not only the Western tradition, but global and local ones as well. I try to lead my honors thesis students and graduate students to make their own discoveries about the past by tracing new connections between disparate works. At all levels, I ask my stu\u00ad dents to discover discovery-to encounter, understand, and reproduce the many acts of cultural restoration and revision that make up the dramas great and small that we call \"the humanities.\" LYNN MALLY Professor of History Distinguished F acuity Lectureship Award for Teaching, 1996 When I tell people I am a historian, I sometimes get a bewildered response: \"How can you stand it? So many names and dates.\" Many students come to the University with the same impression. They expect to be confronted with long lists of facts to memorize and reassem\u00ad ble on exams. It is my job to convince them that historical analysis is a process of discov\u00ad ery. Names and dates are of course important, but they are only the starting point. How do historians create their accounts of past events? How do their own views of the current world affect their vision of the past? How can students learn to evaluate this material critically and construct their own interpretations of historical events? These are the questions I try to raise in my classes. In order to give students a sense of the creative process involved in historical analysis, I make extensive use of written and visual primary source materials. Because I specialize in Russian history, a field that is unfamiliar to most of my students, I believe it is especially important to present sources generated from within Russian society. When investigating the UC IRVINE - 1996-1997changes Nikita Khrushchev implemented in the Soviet Union after Stalin's death, for exam\u00ad ple, I show students a broad range of materials. We examine documents generated by the Communist Party together with memoirs, films, and popular literature. Armed with this information, I ask students to come to their own conclusions about how significantly Khrushchev's reforms altered the Soviet system. My training as a Russian and Soviet historian makes me particularly sensitive to the central\u00ad ity of primary source materials in the process of historical discovery. Before the demise of the Soviet Union, unpublished materials held in archives were tightly controlled by the gov\u00ad ernment. Foreign scholars were denied access to whole sets of documents and sometimes even denied visas to study in the Soviet Union. Beginning with Gorbachev's reforms in the late 1980s, archives and restricted libraries began to open to the public. Scholars now have a chance to evaluate a wide range of materials and to address questions that were once only the subject of speculation. This unprecedented access to new sources has allowed historians to reexamine old debates and pursue entirely new areas of inquiry. As a result of these changes, my area of research is experiencing a wonderful burst of creative energy. I hope I can transmit this sense of excitement and discovery to the students in my classes. KAI-VEUNG (SUNNY) SIU Assistant Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering Distinguished Assistant Professor Award for Research, 1995-96 We currently are experiencing a radical change in our daily lives, thanks to the availability of efficient, low-cost information and communication technology. These technological advances promise to significantly enhance the quality of communication, health care, education, and entertainment, and improve the utilization of our natural resources. As a faculty member of Electrical and Computer Engineering, I have been involved in several research projects in information and networking technology. The research problems my students and I address find a common theme in the technological challenge of constructing an integrated architecture in which computers and communication networks are components of an intelligent information infrastructure. Since I joined the UCI faculty, my research program has taken a new and accelerated path, partly because of the concentration of high-tech industries surrounding our campus. Many of these industries are searching for efficient solutions to new sets of technical issues and they offer a rich source of research problems. Although my research focuses on fundamental concepts and theories, the resulting new insight permits rapid short-term solutions to practi\u00ad cal problems, including those of interest to industry. The exciting new role of the \"informa\u00ad tion engineer\" in solving real-world problems often finds its way into my lectures because I believe understanding how to apply ideas is as important as the ideas themselves for a good engineering education. Speaking of practical applications, local industries offer plentiful employment opportunities for our students following graduation! In the past several years at UCI, I have had some exciting moments of discovery. These moments were special to me not only because they constituted milestones in my research career, but also because they advanced UCI's goal of establishing itself as a premier research institution. I feel fortunate to be able to involve many bright undergraduate and graduate students in my research program. Some of my discoveries would not have been possible without their contributions. With the increasingly widespread use of information and communication technology, these collaborative projects are particularly exciting because they have poten\u00ad tial impact on all walks of life. A great number of my former students have remained in close contact with me since they graduated, and I find hearing about their progress and success most satisfying. Distinguished Faculty 17 UC IRVINE - 1996-199718 UCI 1996-97 Distinguished Faculty In today's environment of rapid technological changes, we also face new challenges in edu\u00ad cating our future engineers. It has always been my conviction that we should emphasize in our classrooms the engineering principles and theoretical foundations. On the other hand, I see an increasing need to inform our students of the latest advances in technology and how they can be applied. Our curriculum has evolved to address the chalienge of balancing the\u00ad ory with practice and, based on my discussions with former students, our graduates have been well served by this approach. At UCI we have some of the newest and finest computing facilities and library resources. Our faculty are involved in leading research while remaining committed to high standards of excellence in education. Consequently, our students are well prepared for meeting the future demand in the coming era of information technology. UCI is a university in which we take pride and which offers a stimulating environment for those eager to experience and share the excitement of discovery. ETEL SOLINGEN Associate Professor of Politics and Society Distinguished Assistant Professor Award for Teaching, 1995-96 Over my years at UCI, I have encountered a special openness on the part of students to learn about the phenomenon of international cooperation. That openness allowed me to develop a dedicated space in our curriculum for the study of international cooperation. On the one hand, understanding cooperation among states requires deepening our knowledge of global political and economic processes as well as of remote regions and cultures. On the other hand, our daily individual experiences are a rich source of ideas that can help us untangle the makeup of cooperative behavior. The ability to link the two levels, the global and the more parochial or personal, offers a particularly rewarding learning context. In addition, students at UCI, whether they come from Orange County or from overseas, bring in a diverse baggage of experiences of particular value to the understanding of inter\u00ad national (and interpersonal) cooperation. This diversity, in turn, provides both students and professors with a privileged environment in which different and innovative approaches can be formulated and tested. The classroom thus functions as both a virtual laboratory on the more elusive global dimensions, and on the more concrete local expressions, of cooperation. To put it simply, diversity at UCI drives intellectual progress in the study of international cooperation. And such progress results from interactions in the classroom as well as in the more individualized-but often cooperative-research activities of students and professors. A further contribution to the study of international cooperation at UCI is the result of an interdisciplinary interest in the topic. To begin with, all the social sciences converge in their concern with the political, economic, psychological, and sociological dimensions of cooper\u00ad ation. Moreover, students majoring in physical and biological sciences have shown to be no less challenged to explore this subject matter. In the first place, they do sense the evident links between the global and local. They also quickly realize that, whatever their field of inquiry, an international cooperative dimension is at play, be it in the realm of environmen\u00ad tal, health, or any other technical field. The basic idea is to create an intellectually stimulating learning environment that plants the seeds for a lifelong interest in cooperation at all levels. Students are not passive recipients in this endeavor, but, instead, contribute to the development of a common enterprise at UCI and beyond. UC IRVINE - 1996-1997In Memoriam JOHN J. WASMUTH Professor of Biological Chemistry, Pediatrics, imd Psychiatry, 1977-1995 Distinguished Faculty Lectureship Award for Research Since I have been old enough to read, mystery stories have captured most of my free time and imagination. Although it may sound very nonacademic, my favorites have been books by Agatha Christie and Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's chronicles of one of my idols, Sherlock Holmes. Both authors scattered a few clues throughout their stories, each of which taken by itself, meant very little. However, someone who had the insight to connect the relevant clues and eliminate the irrelevant information always got the brass ring. When I began to decide what I wanted to do for a living in my adult life, I knew it had to involve solving mysteries. As a graduate student in genetics I realized that, for me, the ultimate mysteries involved understanding the intricacies of how seemingly insignificant differences in the hereditary material, DNA, could explain the enormous variations among people. In particu\u00ad lar, I was struck by the fact that minor differences in almost any one of the 100,000 genes we all have in all our cells could be the difference between a happy, healthy person and a person with a horrible, debilitating genetic disease. What could be a greater mystery to solve than to find the one change in three billion \"bits\" of DNA that is the difference between health and horrible, agonizing death? It is not only a fascinating detective story and a complex puzzle but, once you have solved the mystery for any given genetic disease, you might well have provided the critical piece of information that will enable other scientists or physicians to cure the disease. Since coming to UCI more than 18 years ago, I have spent most of my professional life searching for genes that cause different genetic disorders. As is often the case in science, the first 14 or 15 years of my work involved laying the basic groundwork that I thought was necessary to solve the mysteries of several genetic disorders. Fortunately, the groundwork has paid off in a big way over the past three years; my laboratory and the Human Genome Center that I direct have been involved in identifying the genes and the exact mutations that cause six different genetic diseases, including the genes responsible for an inherited form of colon cancer, a gene that causes the most common form of dwarfism, a gene that is respon\u00ad sible for the most common genetic cause of infant death, and the gene responsible for a severe neurological disorder, Huntington disease. Throughout this work, graduate students, postdoctoral scientists, and undergraduate students have played key roles in each of these discoveries. In fact, without the students, the work could never have been done. As exciting as these discoveries are to me, the students in my laboratory are even more excited when they realize that work they did led directly to solving the extraordinary mystery that is any genetic disorder. No one can imagine what it is like to be the first person in the world to see the exact DNA sequence mutation that causes a genetic disease. It's like being the first person to walk on the moon, except that finding the DNA sequence change that causes a genetic disorder is much more important in terms of the future of humankind than walking on any other celes\u00ad tial body. I am very proud that so many students working with me have experienced the feelings of joy, awe, and ecstasy that come with being the first to visualize the basic cause of a genetic disease that scientists and physicians have been trying to understand for decades or centuries. Professor Wasmuth, one of the world's most prominent genetic researchers, passed away on December 29, 1995. He also was Director of UCI's National Center for Human Genome Research, the sixteenth such site selected by the National Institutes of Health. In his mem\u00ad ory, the Wasmuth Family and UCI have established the John J. Wasmuth Fellowship Fund. For information about this fund, contact the UCI Foundation at (714) 824-6535. Distinguished Faculty 19 UC IRVINE - 1996-1997PREADMISSION MATTERS HOW TO USE THE CATALOGUE The UCI General Catalogue contains general administrative and academic information, descriptions of schools and departments and their curricula, and descriptions of student activities and services. Because the Catalogue must be prepared well in advance of the year it covers, changes in some programs inevitably will occur. The selection of courses to be offered each quarter is subject to change without notice, and some listed courses are not offered each year. The Schedule of Classes, a publication available from the Registrar's Office shortly before registration begins each quar\u00ad ter, provides more current information on classes to be offered, instructors, enrollment procedures, enrollment restrictions (for example, open to majors only, or consent of instructor required), class hours, room assignments, and final examination schedules. Students should consult the appropriate academic unit for even more up-to-date information. (Admission to UCI does not guaran\u00ad tee enrollment in any particular course.) Presentation of information in the UCI General Catalogue is divided into five main concepts (details are found in the Table of Contents): 1. Introduction to UCI 2. Preadmission Matters 3. Information for Admitted Students 4. Research and Graduate Studies 5. Academic Programs: Arts, Biological Sciences, Education, Engineering, Humanities, Information and Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Studies, Management, Physical Sciences, Social Ecology, Social Sciences, and Medicine. Included in the academic unit descriptions are the following kinds of information: a. Brief descriptions of the areas that are covered in each school or program and a brief statement of the educational philoso\u00ad phy and orientation of the unit. b. Lists of faculty members, the institutions from which they received their highest degrees, and their areas of academic interest. c. Requirements for undergraduate and graduate degrees, including those for majors and minors. d. Additional areas of study (referred to as concentrations, spe\u00ad cializations, or emphases). e. Advice about planning a program of study, and other infor\u00ad mation relevant to the academic progress and experience of students majoring in fields within each school or program. f. Courses offered, divided into undergraduate and graduate course listings; those units that are departmentalized present their courses according to the department. Course Listings Undergraduate courses are classified as lower division (numbered 1-99) and upper division (numbered 100-199). Courses numbered 200 and above are graduate or professional courses. Lower divi\u00ad sion usually refers to freshman-sophomore courses, upper division to junior-senior courses. However, junior and senior students may take lower-division courses, and freshmen and sophomores may normally take upper-division courses when upper-division standing is not a prerequisite and when any academic or other prerequisites have been met. Prerequisites for courses should be noted carefully; a course has no prerequisites unless indicated. Courses with sequential designations (for example, lA-B-C) nor\u00ad mally indicate multiple-quarter courses; except as noted, each course in a sequence is prerequisite to the one following. The letter L following a course number usually designates a laboratory course. The letter H preceding a course number designates an hon\u00ad ors course. The (4) or (4-4-4) designation following the course title indicates the quarter unit credits toward graduation. Some courses give other than four units of credit; for example, two, five, or a range of from one to 12. The notations F, W, S, or Summer after the course number and title indicate when the course will be offered: fall, winter, or spring quarter, or summer session. When a course is approved for satisfaction of the UCI breadth requirement, the breadth category is indicated by a Roman numeral in parentheses at the end of the course description. However, courses which have been approved to fulfill the upper-division writing requirement are not designated in this Catalogue. Rather, they are designated in the quarterly Schedule of Classes with a W following the course number. Students should refer to the Schedule of Classes for a complete listing of approved upper-division writ\u00ad ing courses. OFFICE OF ADMISSIONS AND RELATIONS WITH SCHOOLS The Office of Admissions and Relations with Schools is a division of Student Services. The mission of the Office of Admissions and Relations with Schools is to: (1) optimize UCI's undergraduate enrollments by implementing Academic Senate, universitywide, and campus policies for the selection and admission of new fresh\u00ad man and transfer students; and (2) stimulate and advance coopera\u00ad tive educational relationships between UCI and California schools and colleges.

UC IRVINE - 1996-1997UNDERGRADUATE MAJORS, MINORS, AND ASSOCIATED AREAS OF STUDY Students are urged to become informed of and understand all requirements concerning their intended majors, minors, and associ\u00ad ated areas of study. Special restrictions apply to some majors and minors; for example, some minors require formal application or declaration by students, others may be completed without such for\u00ad malities. Information about the programs listed below may be found in the academic unit sections of the Catalogue. Undergraduate majors are offered in all of the bachelor's degree programs on the list of degree titles; the degree programs are referred to as majors in the following list. In association with these majors, UCI offers a number of minors, concentrations, specializa\u00ad tions, and emphases. A minor consists of a coordinated set of courses (seven or more) which together take a student well beyond the introductory level in an academic field, slitlject matter, and/or discipline but which are not sufficient to constitute a major. An interdisciplinary minor consists of courses offered by two or more schools or programs. All minors, including interdisciplinary minors, are available to all students regardless of their major, with the exception that students may not minor in their major. Minors are listed on a student's tran\u00ad script but are not listed on the baccalaureate diploma. A concentration is a program of interdisciplinary study consisting of courses offered by two or more schools or programs. Concentra\u00ad tions are similar to minors in that they require fewer units of work than majors do, and the area of concentration appears on the stu\u00ad dent's transcript but not on the baccalaureate diploma. Concentra\u00ad tions are taken in combination with a major in one of the schools or programs offering the concentration. A specialization is a program of study which enables students to focus on courses in a particular field within a major. The area of specialization pursued appears on the student's transcript but not on the baccalaureate diploma. An emphasis is a program of study within a major which empha\u00ad sizes a specific area of the discipline. Emphases usually have a defined course of study and are not listed on the transcript nor on the baccalaureate diploma.

MAJORS AND CAREERS Choosing a Major Many students select their University major, the field of study which represents their principal academic interest, at the time they fill out their University of California Undergraduate Application. Some students, however, are not ready to choose a major at the time they apply, and still others may wish to change to a different major after they have enrolled. In preparation for choosing a major, students need to familiarize themselves as much as possible with UCI and its academic pro\u00ad grams. Entering students are exposed to a wide range of areas of study, and it is not unusual for students to become enthusiastic about academic disciplines previously unfamiliar to them. At UCI a number of traditionally separate academic disciplines have strong interrelationships, so that the academic environment is influenced by broad interactions among disciplines. As a complement to class\u00ad room study, UCI encourages its students to become involved in a variety of educational experiences such as independent study, labo\u00ad ratory research, field study, writing workshops, computing, and fine arts productions. Such experiences can help students identify additional areas of interest. The UCI General Catalogue is a good place to find specific infor\u00ad mation about programs available, requirements for majors, and course offerings. In addition to consulting the Catalogue, students are encouraged to talk to academic counselors and faculty advisors about the opportunities which are open to them. They may go to any department in order to learn more about its programs of study, its requirements for graduation, and possible enrollment limita\u00ad tions. (Some majors are impacted, that is, more students apply than can be accommodated. See the Undergraduate Admissions section for information.) While advisors may not be familiar with all fields, they can suggest ways to investigate other areas of study and be helpful in planning a lower-division program which will keep several options open. Courses and workshops designed to assist students in choosing a major are offered by the Career Plan\u00ad ning and Placement Center and by the Division of Undergraduate Education, as well as by some of the academic units. All students are required to choose a major by the time they reach junior status. It is important to look well ahead to this decision and to think about it carefully during the freshman and sophomore years. When considering possible majors, students should keep in mind that some major programs require quite specific preliminary study. At the same time, excessive early concentration could reduce a student's options and could cause the student to need more than four years to obtain the baccalaureate degree. Furthermore, courses required for graduation need to be considered. For these reasons, it is desirable for students to plan their programs carefully and thoughtfully, seeking a balance between exposure to a variety of academic areas and completion of courses which are prerequisite to a major under consideration. A qualified student interested in two areas of study may graduate with a double major by fulfilling the degree requirements of any two programs. Certain restrictions may apply; students interested in pursuing a double major should check with their academic advisor. Each school or program has its own standards for change of major, and some majors are impacted, as indicated above. Once a student selects a major, or decides to change majors, the student should visit the academic counseling office for their prospective major to obtain current information about prerequisites, program planning, and poli\u00ad cies and procedures. In addition, a form called the Undergraduate Petition for Change of Major must be completed. The form is avail\u00ad able from academic counselors and the Registrar's Office. Undecided/Undeclared Students Students who enter the University as freshmen or sophomores may be uncertain about which major they should choose and may not feel ready to declare their major until they have been on campus for a while. Such students participate in the General Studies Advis\u00ad ing Program (GSAP) which is administered by the Division of Undergraduate Education. The goal of GSAP is to help students make the best informed and most rational choice of a major that is possible. All students at UCI are required to choose their major by the time they reach junior status. To make a good decision about what major to declare, students should know what programs UCI offers and have some experience with them, have a good knowledge of their own abilities and inter\u00ad ests, have clear educational goals, and have a good sense of their vocational goals and of the academic programs at UCI that will provide appropriate preparation. Students in GSAP receive individ\u00ad ualized counseling that helps them explore the variety of course offerings on campus, become more aware of their own interests and abilities, formulate sound educational goals, and learn how to prepare for graduate education and/or possible careers. To assist students in choosing a major, GSAP has created a two\u00ad quarter required course designed to expose undecided/undeclared students to a variety of opportunities and resources available to them on the campus, and to introduce students to each of the schools and majors offered. In addition, students learn about research and career opportunities within different disciplines. GSAP is located in 256 Administration Building; telephone (714) 824-6987. Courses in Undergraduate Education University Studies lA-B University Experience: Issues and Options for Undecided/Undeclared Students (2-2). Introduces new undecided/unde\u00ad clared freshmen to university issues, resources, and options as they learn about the academic undergraduate culture at UCI. Two-quarter course emphasizes necessary skills and tools for being a successful student, fol\u00ad lowed by a systematic exploration of UCI's undergraduate majors with a focus on decision-making skills. University Studies 192 Group Project for Discussion Leaders (2). For dis\u00ad cussion leaders for University Studies lA-B. Weekly discussion group train\u00ad ing for leading effective groups in addition to evaluations of weekly discus\u00ad sion sections and completion of a special project on issues of freshman development. Prerequisite: consent of instructor. UC IRVINE - 1996-199727 UC/ students are encouraged to participate in research, independent study, creative activities, and field study to complement their classroom experi\u00ad ences. Many departments offer special programs and courses that integrate these activities into the curriculum. UC IRVINE - 1996-199728 UCI 1996-97 Preadmission Matters Preparation for Graduate or Professional Study Undergraduate students ought to keep the possibility of future graduate or professional study in mind as they plan their academic programs, and they should discuss their career goals with their advisors. Students who have an idea of the direction in which they would like to go should familiarize themselves with the basic requirements for postbaccalaureate study and keep those require\u00ad ments in mind when selecting courses. Furthermore, students should supplement their undergraduate programs by anticipating foreign language or other special requirements at major graduate schools and by intensive work in areas outside their major that are of special relevance to their intended graduate work. For information about graduate or professional study in a given field, students should consult the graduate advisor or academic counselor in the academic unit corresponding to the area cf inter\u00ad est. Also, the Career and Life Planning Center frequently sponsors seminars on specific career areas and offers a number of services useful to those considering graduate or professional study. Preprofessional Preparation LAW Law schools want to produce lawyers to serve the entire legal spectrum (for example tax, criminal, entertainment, or immigration law), and this requires a wide range of academic backgrounds. Law schools look less for specific areas of study than they do for evi\u00ad dence of excellence in any academic program. A good record in physics or classics, for example, will be preferred over a mediocre record in history or political science. The majority of law schools give equal preference to students from all academic disciplines. Courses that help develop writing and analytical skills (logic, writ\u00ad ing, mathematics, research methods, and statistics courses, for example) build skills that are the key to doing well on the Law School Admissions Test (LSAT), succeeding in law school, and entering the legal profession. UCI offers a number of law-related courses that students in any major may take. The School of Humanities offers courses in logic and the philosophy of law. The School of Social Sciences offers courses in the study of law, international relations, and economics of law and recommends that students take some political science courses as well. The School of Social Ecology offers many law\u00ad related courses in both substantive law (such as environmental and criminal law) and in law and society and criminal justice. The School also offers its majors the opportunity to apply theories learned in the classroom to actual problems through its field study program. Students interested in applying to law school after completing the baccalaureate degree should know that law schools look closely at five aspects of a student's application: grades, LSAT results, the applicant's statement of purpose, in-depth letters of recommenda\u00ad tion, and extracurricular activities and law-related work experience. Students should be aware that not everyone who applies is admit\u00ad ted to law school. One consideration in selecting an undergraduate major is alternative career opportunities should one's career goals change or should experience with law school result in a decision not to enter the field of law. MEDICINE AND OTHER HEALTH-RELATED SCIENCES Although leaders in health science education strongly recommend that students obtain a bachelor's degree prior to admission to the health sciences, there is no preferred major. Many UCI students who plan to enter the health professions major in Biological Sci\u00ad ences because much of the basic course work for that major is the same as the preparation required for medical school admission; however, students may major in any academic field as long as they also take the courses required by professional health science schools. The minimum amount of undergraduate preparation required by most medical and health-related schools includes one year each of English, biology with laboratory, general chemistry with laboratory, organic chemistry with laboratory, physics with laboratory, and college mathematics, especially calculus and statis\u00ad tics. Courses in cell or molecular biology, biochemistry, genetics, developmental physiology or comparative anatomy, and vertebrate embryology are recommended, as is course work in computer sci\u00ad ence. In addition, some health sciences schools have certain non\u00ad science course requirements or recommended courses in, for exam\u00ad ple, English and/or a foreign language. Facility with the Spanish language is very helpful in California medical schools and in other areas of the United States with large Hispanic populations. Although many factors ultimately are considered when reviewing applicants for admission, admission committees look carefully at the following seven areas: college grade point average (science and nonscience grades are evaluated separately, and evidence of improvement in work during the undergraduate years is important); results of the Medical College Admission Test (MCAT), the Dental Admission Test, and other aptitude examination scores; the stu\u00ad dent's personal essay and/or personal interview; in-depth letters of recommendation; practical experience in the health sciences, whether paid or volunteer, which is regarded favorably as an indi\u00ad cation of exposure to and interest in the health sciences; extracur\u00ad ricular activities which demonstrate the applicant's ability to inter\u00ad act successfully with others; and research experience, especially in a biological, medical, or behavioral science. Since medical programs cannot accommodate all qualified appli\u00ad cants and competition for entrance is keen, it is important to keep in mind alternative career opportunities should one not be accepted to medical, dental, pharmacy, optometry, podiatry, or veterinary school, or should one decide to pursue instead one of the expand\u00ad ing number of health-related programs now available. BUSINESS/MANAGEMENT The contemporary executive or manager must be a creative thinker, make complex decisions, and have the ability to perceive and par\u00ad ticipate in the full scope of an enterprise while understanding its role in the economy. Effective management requires leadership ability, strong problem-solving skills, the ability to successfully deploy and manage information technologies, effective oral and written communication skills, analytical skills, an understanding of global economic trends, and a basic knowledge of behavioral processes in organizations. Although UCI does not offer a prebusiness program leading to an undergraduate degree in business, the Graduate School of Manage\u00ad ment offers a minor in Management as a supplement to any under\u00ad graduate major. This minor can provide students with a broad understanding of management theory and practice. In addition, it may be helpful to students in determining whether they wish to pursue a career in business or management or undertake further study in management at the graduate level. Students can also supplement their major course work to develop the skills needed for business and management by taking electives such as calculus, statistics, economics, psychology, sociology, computer science, and political science. Students are encouraged to undertake intensive course work in the culture, history, geography, economy, politics, and language of specific foreign countries. For admission purposes, the majority of graduate schools of busi\u00ad ness look at five areas: grades, scores on the Graduate Management Admission Test (GMAT), the applicant's statement of purpose, in\u00ad depth letters of recommendation, and evidence of leadership in school and community activities and work experience. Substantive UC IRVINE - 1996-1997work experience is becoming an increasingly important prerequi\u00ad site for many programs. Students from a variety of undergraduate disciplines including lib\u00ad eral arts, social sciences, physical or biological sciences, computer science, and engineering are encouraged to apply to UCI's Gradu\u00ad ate School of Management. Career Opportunities The eight academic units at UCI which offer undergraduate educa\u00ad tion leading to the bachelor's degree provide students with a vari\u00ad ety of opportunities to explore a wide range of interests leading to a career choice or to further education at the graduate or profes\u00ad sional level. The lists which follow are meant to indicate to stu\u00ad dents the many and varied career areas pursued by UCI graduates, and to make students aware of some of the vast array of career choices available. Additional discussions of careers are presented in individual academic unit sections. Any major can lead to any number of careers. Some examples of careers frequently led to by majors available within the academic units at UCI are listed below.

However, there are many other careers to explore in numerous arts-related areas, or the graduate may wish to combine part-time professional performance with supplemental work. The field of arts administration is an increasingly important career area, offering opportunities to work with opera and dance companies, repertory theatre companies, museums, state and local arts coun\u00ad cils, community arts organizations, and arts festivals.

Their careers typically involve them in one or more of the following: design, research and development, manu\u00ad facturing or construction, operations, consulting, applications and sales, management, or teaching. At UCI they will have had the choice of Aerospace, Chemical, Civil, Computer, Electrical, Envi\u00ad ronmental, or Mechanical Engineering, as well as a general pro\u00ad gram in Engineering. However, they will frequently find challeng\u00ad ing positions in related areas such as biomedical or industrial engineering, for which their general and specialty course work at UCI, followed by formal or informal, on-the-job training will qual\u00ad ify them. Approximately half of UCI's engineering graduates even\u00ad tually obtain advanced degrees (at UCI or elsewhere), and almost all engage in some sort of continuing education to keep abreast of advances in technology. Many engineering graduates have used their engineering background to enter graduate programs and obtain degrees in the fields of administration, law, medicine, physics, or mathematics. Humanities Career Areas Advertising Banking Broadcasting Business Foreign Service Government Service Human Resources Insurance International Relations Journalism Law Library Science Management/ Administration Marketing Personnel Public Administration Public Relations Publicity Publishing Research Retail Sales Social Welfare Teaching Technical Writing Tourism Translating/Interpreting Writing Diverse career fields available to Humanities graduates include entry-level positions in both the public and private sectors or pro\u00ad fessional-level opportunities combining the degree with further UC IRVINE - 1996-199730 UCI 1996-97 Preadmission Matters specialization. Humanities graduates may also elect to enter profes\u00ad sional programs such as law, library science, medicine (with proper prerequisites), or public administration. Business and industry uti\u00ad lize Humanities graduates for management training programs in banking, retail sales, and insurance. Graduates with special skills in oral and written communications may look to positions with newspapers, advertising agencies, public relations firms, radio and television stations, and publishing houses. Technical writers are currently in demand, particularly those who have had some preparation in engineering, computer science, and the sciences. Opportunities for graduates fluent in foreign lan\u00ad guages exist in government, business, social service, counseling, foreign service, and international trade, among others.

Many graduates specify, design, and develop a variety of computer-based systems comprised of software and hardware in virtually every application domain, such as aerospace, automotive, biomedical, consumer products, engi\u00ad neering, entertainment, environmental, finance, investment, law, management, manufacturing, and pharmacology. res graduates also find jobs as members of research and development teams, developing advanced technologies, designing software and hard\u00ad ware systems, and specifying, designing, and maintaining comput\u00ad ing infrastructures for a variety of institutions. Some work for established or start-up companies while others work as indepen\u00ad dent consultants. After a few years in industry, many move into management or advanced technical positions. Some ICS students also use the undergraduate major as preparation for graduate study in computer science or another field (e.g., medicine, law, engineer\u00ad ing, management). Physical Sciences Career Areas Actuarial Science Aerospace Analytical Chemistry Applied Physics and Chemistry Astrophysics/ Astronomy Bioscience Computers Energy Science Electronics Engineering Applications Environmental Science Food Chemistry Forensic Chemistry Geoscience Inorganic Chemistry Instrumentation Laboratory Science Lasers Materials Science Medicine Nuclear Science Optical Devices Organic Chemistry Pharmacology Physical Chemistry Plasma Physics Quality Control Radiation Science Radiology Solid State Devices Space Science Statistics Teaching Graduates of the School of Physical Sciences have backgrounds appropriate to a variety of areas in research, teaching, and manage\u00ad ment. Career opportunities for physical scientists are found in fed\u00ad eral, state, and local government as well as in private industry. Chemists may work in research and development and in jobs deal\u00ad ing with health, pollution, energy, fuel, drugs, and plastics. Water districts, crime labs, and major chemical and oil companies are also good resources for employment. Mathematics graduates find employment in both government and the private sector in such technical fields as operations research, computer programming, marketing research, actuarial work, banking, retail management, and scientific research. Physics graduates find professional posi\u00ad tions in education, research and development, and in the electronic and aerospace industries.

UC IRVINE - 1996-1997SPECIAL PROGRAMS Educational Opportunity Program UCI recognizes and values the contributions of a student commu\u00ad nity that ryf!ects the cultural, ethnic, and socioeconomic diversity of the people of California. The Educational Opportunity Program (EOP) provides pre-University programs and services aimed at increasing the eligibility rates for socioeconomically disadvantaged students. Qualification for EOP is based primarily on f~mily income level, and all students served by the program must be Cali\u00ad fornia residents, with the exception of American Indian students. EOP programs and services are located in the Office of Admissions and Relations with Schools and in the Center for Educational Part\u00ad nerships; telephone (714) 824-7484; e-mail: oars@l!ci.edu. Admission. Outreach counselors in the Office of Admissions and Relations with Schools visit high schools and community colleges throughout California and meet with prospective students, parents, teachers, counselors, and school officials to discuss the admission and financial aid process, housing, and the academic opportunities available at UCI. Prospective students indicate their interest in being considered for EOP services on the UC Undergraduate Application for Admission and must pr~vide the information requested. Application fee waivers are available for low-income applicants who meet the eli\u00ad gibility criteria. Housing. UCI guarantees on-campus housing to all new EOP stu\u00ad dents who meet the housing application deadline. Prior to enrolling at UCI, a limited number of admitted EOP stu\u00ad dents are invited to participate in a Summer Bridge Program spon\u00ad sored by Student Academic Advancement Services (SAAS). SAAS and the California Alliance for Minority Participation in Science, Engineering, and Mathematics (CAMP) offer a variety of services to EOP students once they\"enroll at UCI including advising, tutor\u00ad ing, and learning skills services. Center for Educational Partnerships The Center for Educational Partnerships supports cooperative edu\u00ad cational partnerships among UCI and California schools and col\u00ad leges, and provides pre-enrollment services to prospective students. Partnership Programs. The Partnership Network, an academic collaboration including UCI, K-12 schools, and postsecondary institutions, was established to encourage and develop creative leadership through various forums and to bring to light the best understanding of effective educational practices, paradigms, and structures. Project STEP (Student/Teacher Educational Partnership) is a regional model of institutional collaboration from K-16 to improve the college attendance rates of minority students. Participating campuses include UCI, California State University at Fullerton, Rancho Santiago College, Chapman College, and the Santa Ana Unified School District. Santa Ana Networks includes activities which focus on increasing the educational achievement of at-risk youth and is based on the premise that the educational system must reach and serve students in new far-ranging ways, and engage partners who are equally committed to student success. This is accomplished on the strength of two existing programs, Project STEP, which is mentioned above, and Santa Ana 2000, a business/community/citywide partnership. Summer Scholars Transfer Institute, a collaborative Rancho Santi\u00ad ago College/UCI residential summer institute, facilitates the trans\u00ad fer of at-risk students to a four-year university and is a successful model of two institutions working together to provide academic readiness. Special Programs 31 Pre-College Initiatives and Services. The Center for Educational Partnerships promotes statewide pre-college initiatives that help disadvantaged students develop the academic skills and back\u00ad ground needed to enter college. These initiatives include Mathe\u00ad matics, Engineering, Science Achievement (MESA); Young Black Scholars; Upward Bound; and California Student Opportunity and Access Program (Cal SOAP). Call (714) 824-7482 for information. Early Academic Outreach and Academic Development Partnerships provide pre-enrollment services.

Student Academic Advancement Services Student Academic Advancement Services (SAAS), a unit of the Division of Undergraduate Education, provides support services to students who are first-generation college students or low-income students, as well as disabled students (those with physical and/or learning disabilities). The goal of SAAS is to help students earn their University degree. See the Division of Undergraduate Educa\u00ad tion section of the Catalogue for additional information. Graduate and Professional Opportunity Program Through the Graduate and Professional Opportunity Program (GPOP), steps are taken to increase the participation of students from traditionally underrepresented groups in graduate education. The University has identified African-Americans, Mexican-Ameri\u00ad cans/Chicanos, American Indians/Native Americans, Filipinos, and Latinos as the most severely underrepresented groups, and it recog\u00ad nizes that Asian-Americans and women are underrepresented in certain fields. GPOP offers several programs and services for new and continuing graduate students. Eligibility for merit-based fellowships is based on demonstrated scholastic achievement, full-time status, and U.S. citi\u00ad zenship. Students may be asked to provide verification of ethnicity. Assistance is offered during the admission process, and every effort is made through GPOP advisement and support to ensure that all stu\u00ad dents will have the opportunity to attain their academic objectives.

UC IRVINE - 1996-199734 UCI 1996-97 Preadmission Matters CALIFORNIA RESIDENCE AND THE NONRESIDENT TUITION FEE All students who have not lived in California with the intent to make California their permanent home for more than one calendar year prior to the residence determination date for each quarter or semester they propose to attend the University must pay a Nonresi\u00ad dent Tuition Fee. The residence determination date is the day instruction begins at the last of the University of California cam\u00ad puses to open for the quarter, and for schools on the semester sys\u00ad tem, the day instruction begins for the semester. Laws Governing Residence The rules regarding residence classification for tuition purposes at the University of California are governed by the California Educa\u00ad tional Code and implemented by Standing Orders of the Regents of the University of California. Under these rules adult citizens and certain classes of aliens can establish residence for tuition pur\u00ad poses. There are particular rules that apply to the residence classi\u00ad fication of minors. Who Is a Resident? Adult students (at least 18 years of age), may establish residence for tuition purposes in California if they are a: (1) U.S. citizen; (2) permanent resident or other immigrant; or (3) a nonimmigrant who is not precluded from establishing a domicile in the U.S. This includes nonimmigrants who hold valid visas of the following types: A, E, H-1, H-4, I, K, L, 0-1, 0-3, orR. To establish residence a student must, immediately prior to the residence determination date: 1. Be physically present in California for more than one calendar year, and 2. Must have come to California with the intent to make California the permanent home. For example, physical presence within the state of California solely for educational purposes does not con\u00ad stitute the establishment of California residence, regardless of the length of stay. 3. Students whose parents are not residents of California will be required to meet the Financial Independence requirement to be a resident for tuition purposes. Residence cannot be derived from a spouse or parents. Requirements for Financial Independence Students are considered \"financially independent\" if they fall into at least one of the following categories: 1. At least 24 years of age by December 31 of the calendar year for which residence classification is requested. 2. Veteran of the U.S. Armed Forces. 3. A ward of the court or both parents are deceased. 4. Have legal dependents other than a spouse. 5. A married student, or a graduate student, or a professional stu\u00ad dent who was not claimed as an income tax deduction by par\u00ad ents or any other individual for the tax year immediately preced\u00ad ing the term for which resident classification is requested. 6. An unmarried undergraduate student not claimed as an income tax deduction by parents or any other individual for the two tax years immediately preceding the term for which resident classi\u00ad fication is requested and can demonstrate self-sufficiency for those years. NOTE: Financial dependence is not a factor in residence status for graduate student instructors, graduate student teaching assistants, research assistants, junior specialists, postgraduate researchers, graduate student researchers, and teaching associates who are employed 49 percent or more of full time in the term for which resident classification is requested. Establishing Intent to become a California Resident Relevant indicia that contribute to the demonstration of a student's intent to make California the permanent home include, but are not limited to the following: registering to vote and voting in Califor\u00ad nia elections, designating a California permanent address on all records (i.e., school, employment, military), a California Driver's License, a California Identification Card, California vehicle regis\u00ad tration, paying California income taxes as a resident (including taxes on income earned outside California from the date California residence was established), maintaining a California residence in which personal belongings are kept, licensing for professional practice in California, and the absence of these indicia in places other than California during any period for which residence in Cal\u00ad ifornia is asserted. General Rules Applying to Minors The residence of the parent with whom an unmarried minor (under the age of 18) lives is the residence of the unmarried minor. When the unmarried minor does not live with either parent, the residence of the unmarried minor is that of the parent with whom the unmar\u00ad ried minor last lived. An unmarried minor may establish his or her own residence when both parents are deceased and a legal guardian has not been appointed unless the unmarried minor is a minor alien who is precluded by the Immigration and Nationality Act from establishing domicile in the U.S. The residence of an unmarried minor who has a parent living cannot be changed by the unmar\u00ad ried minor's own act, by the appointment of a legal guardian, or by the relinquishment of a parent's right of control. Specific Rules Applying to Minors 1. Parent of Minor Moves from California. If the California resi\u00ad dent parent(s) of an eligible minor moves from California, the minor will be entitled to resident classification as long as the minor enrolls for full-time attendance in a California public postsecondary institution within one calendar year of the par\u00ad ent's departure, and remains physically present in California. This classification will continue until the minor has attained the age of majority and has resided in California for the minimum time required to become a resident. The Financial Independence requirement does not apply to this situation. 2. Self-Supporting Minor. Minor students who are U.S. citizens or eligible aliens may be eligible for resident classification if documentation of physical presence, intent to be a California resident, and self-support through the student's own employ\u00ad ment or credit is provided for the entire calendar year prior to the residence determination. 3. Two-Year Care and Control. Minor students who are U.S. citi\u00ad zens or eligible aliens may be eligible for resident classification if they have lived with and been under the continuous care and control of an adult or series of adults other than a parent for not less than two calendar years. The adult or series of adults must have been responsible for care and control for the entire two\u00ad year period and must be California residents prior to the resi\u00ad dence determination date. Exemptions from the Nonresident Tuition Fee Students for which the following conditions apply may be eligible to an exemption from the Nonresident Tuition Fee. 1. Member of the Military. A student who is a member of the United States military stationed in California on active duty, unless assigned for educational purposes to a state-supported institution of higher education. UC IRVINE - 1996-19972. Child or Spouse of a Member of the Military. A student who is the natural or adopted dependent child or spouse of a member of the United States military stationed in California on active duty, unless the member of the military is assigned for educational purposes to a state-supported institution of higher education. 3. Child or Spouse of a Faculty Member. To the extent that funds are available, a student who is the unmarried, dependent child under the age of 21 or the spouse of a University of California faculty member who is a member of the Academic Senate. 4. Child or Spouse of a University Employee. A student who is the unmarried, dependent child under the age of 21 or the spouse of a full-time employee of the University of California who is permanently assigned to work outside the state of Cali\u00ad fornia (i.e., Los Alamos National Laboratory). 5. Child of a Deceased Public Law Enforcement or Fire Sup\u00ad pression Employee. A student who is the child of dece;tsed pub\u00ad lic law enforcement or fire suppression employees, who were California residents and who were killed in the course of law enforcement or fire suppression duties. 6. Dependent Child of a California Resident. A student who has not been an adult resident for more than one year and is the nat\u00ad ural or adopted dependent child of a California resident who has been a resident for more than one year immediately prior to the residence determination date. The student must also maintain full\u00ad time attendance in a California public postsecondary institution. 7. Graduate of a California school operated by the Federal Bureau of Indian Affairs (B.I.A.). A student who is a graduate of a California school operated by the B.I.A. (i.e., Sherman Indian High School) and who enrolls at the University of California. Temporary Absences If a nonresident student is in the process of establishing a residence for tuition purposes and returns to his or her former home during noninstructional periods, the student's presence in California will be presumed to be solely of educational purposes and only convincing evidence to the contrary will rebut this presumption. Students who are in the state of California solely for educational purposes will not be classified as residents for tuition purposes regardless of their length of stay in California. If a student who has been classified as a resident for tuition pur\u00ad poses leaves California temporarily, the absence could result in the loss of California residence. The burden is on the student to prove by documentation that he or she (or the parents if the student is a minor) did nothing inconsistent with a claim of continuing Califor\u00ad nia residence during an absence. Steps that should be taken to retain California residence include, but are not limited to: 1. Continue to use a California address on all records (educational, employment, military, among others). 2. Continue to satisfy California tax obligations. A student claim\u00ad ing California residence is liable for payment of income taxes on his or her total income from the date he or she begins to establish residence in California including income earned in another state or country. 3. Retain a California voter's registration and vote by absentee ballot. 4. Maintain a California Driver's License, California Identification Card, and vehicle registration in California. If it is necessary to change the driver's license or vehicle registration, then it must be changed back to California in the time prescribed by law. Petition for Resident Classification A Petition for Resident Classification must be filed in person at the Office of the Registrar by the applicable deadline to be eligible for Expenses and Fees 35 a change of classification from nonresident to resident for tuition purposes. Specific filing deadline dates for each quarter are printed in the Schedule of Classes. Late petitions will not be accepted. Time Limitation on Providing Documentation Students may be allowed a period of time no later than the end of the quarter to provide additional documentation required for resi\u00ad dence classification. Incorrect Classification Any student found to be incorrectly classified as a resident is sub\u00ad ject to nonresident classification and to payment of all Nonresident Tuition Fees not paid. If a student has concealed information or furnished false information and was classified incorrectly as a result, the student is also subject to University discipline. Resident students who become nonresidents of California must immediately notify the UCI Residence Deputy. Inquiries and Appeals Inquiries regarding residence requirements, determination, and/or recognized exceptions should be directed to the Residence Deputy, Office of the Registrar, 215 Administration Building, University of California, Irvine, CA 92697-4975, telephone (714) 824-6129, or to the Legal Analyst, Residence Matters, 300 Lakeside Drive, 7th Floor, Oakland, CA 94612-3565. No other University personnel are authorized to supply information relative to residence require\u00ad ments for tuition fee purposes. This summary is not a complete explanation of the law regarding residence classification. A copy of the regulations adopted by The Regents of the University of California is available for inspection in the Office of the Registrar. Changes may be made in the resi\u00ad dence requirements between the publication of this statement and the relevant residence determination date. Any student, following a final decision on residence classification by the Residence Deputy, may appeal in writing to the Legal Analyst within 45 days of noti\u00ad fication of the Residence Deputy's final decision. Fee Refunds Student Fee Refunds Students who pay fees for a regular academic quarter and then decide to withdraw from the University must submit a Cancella\u00ad tion/Withdrawal form to the Registrar's Office after obtaining the signatures of their academic dean and, for undergraduate students, the University Ombudsman. Medical students must submit the form to the Curricular Affairs Office in the College of Medicine. This form serves two purposes: (1) a refund of fees, if applicable; and (2) automatic withdrawal from classes. The effective date of withdrawal used in determining the percent\u00ad age of fees to be refunded is the date on which the student submits the Cancellation/Withdrawal form to the Registrar's Office, or, in the case of medical students, to the Curricular Affairs Office. It is presumed that no .University services will be provided to the stu\u00ad dent after that date. Registration fees are refunded as follows. New Undergraduate Students.

Any cash disbursements, other than work-study, that a student received may also require repay\u00ad ment. The refund amount for new students who receive Title IV Federal financial assistance and withdraw during their first term at UCI is calculated as shown below. Students withdrawing who received loans must schedule an exit interview with the Financial Services Office at (714) 824-7081.

FINANCIAL AID Lack of funds need not be a barrier to attending UCI; more than 60 percent of UCI's enrolled students receive some form of financial aid. Students who demonstrate that they need financial assistance in order to attend may be eligible for scholarships, grants, loans, and/or work-study awards through the Financial Aid Office. In addition to awarding aid on the basis of financial need, some scholarships are awarded on the basis of academic excellence. Information regarding the application process, deadlines, and financial aid programs for undergraduate, graduate, and medical students may be found in the Financial Aid at UCI handbook. The handbook is mailed to entering students in December and is avail\u00ad able to continuing students in January in the Financial Aid Office, 102 Administration Building; telephone (714) 824-8262. Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA/Renewal Application). To obtain financial aid, new and continuing students must file the FAFSA/Renewal Application and the necessary sup\u00ad porting documents each year. The FAFSA is available at high schools, local colleges and universities, and at the UCI Financial Aid Office. Renewal applications are mailed to current financial aid recipients starting in mid-November and continuing through mid-December. Students are encouraged to apply as early as possi\u00ad ble after January 1. The priority deadline for loans, work-study, and most grants is March 2. The University expects the student and the parent (or spouse) to contribute toward the educational costs to every extent possible. For dependent students, an analysis of the FAFSA and supporting documents determine the amount a student and the student's par\u00ad ents can be expected to contribute toward the cost of the student's education. For independent students, the analysis determines the amount a student and/or, if applicable, a spouse can contribute to the cost of the student's education. Income, assets, size of family, and the number of family members in college are the major factors considered in the analysis. Assets include, but are not limited to, equity in real estate other than family residence; stocks, bonds, and other securities; business equity; and cash, savings, and checking accounts. Income includes wages, salaries, interest, dividends, and nontaxable income such as Social Security and Veterans' benefits. All undergraduate financial aid applicants are required to apply for a Pell Grant, and, in addition, eligible California residents are required to apply for a Cal Grant. The application deadline for Cal Grants is March 2 for the following academic year. Special Expenditures. Financial aid recipients who are in need of money for special expenditures (beyond the cost of books and basic supplies associated with certain courses of study) may make an appointment to see a financial aid counselor to explore the pos\u00ad sibility of a budget extension, based on the availability of funds. Examples of such special expenditures include special equipment for students with disabilities. Eligibility Requirements Federal financial aid programs are subject to regulations that define the crite\u00ad ria students must meet to qualify and maintain eligibility for those programs. The regulations state that a student must: (1) be a U.S. citizen or an eligible noncitizen of the U,S.; (2) be accepted for admission to the University; (3) be enrolled in good standing at the University; units taken through the Univer\u00ad sity Extension program are not counted toward half-or full-time enrollment; (4) demonstrate financial need (except for Federal Direct Unsubsidized Stafford Loans and Federal PLUS loans); financial need is the difference between the reasonable and approved expenses of attending UCI and all available resources, including a contribution from parents, the student, and any outside aid; (5) maintain satisfactory academic progress for financial aid, as outlined below; (6) be registered with the Selective Service if the student is a male at least 18 years old, born after December 31, 1959, and not on active duty with the armed forces. Once a student meets the above criteria, disbursement of financial aid funds is made only if the student does not have outstanding debts owed to UCI, has not defaulted on any loan received while attending any postsecondary institution, and does not owe a refund on any grant received at any postsec\u00ad ondary institution. UCI POLICY ON SATISFACTORY ACADEMIC PROGRESS FOR FINANCIAL AID Undergraduate and Graduate Students In defining student eligibility for financial aid, the Higher Education Act Amendments of 1986 state that a student must maintain \"satisfactory progress in the course of study the student is pursuing, according to the stan\u00ad dards and practices of the institution at which the student is in attendance.\" Federal regulations of May 1982 state that each institution shall establish, publish, and apply \"reasonable standards\" for assuring that every student receiving need-based financial aid should maintain \"satisfactory progress in his/her course of study.\" Final Federal regulations, published October 6, 1983, state that \"in order to receive student financial aid under the programs authorized by Title IV of the Higher Education Act, a student must be main\u00ad taining satisfactory progress in the course of study he or she is pursuing according to the standards and practices of the institution in which he or she is enrolled.\" Satisfactory Academic Progress Requirements for Financial Aid The following requirements for satisfactory academic progress for receipt of financial aid apply to all applicants for any financial aid awards administered by the UCI Financial Aid Office. These requirements are separate and dis\u00ad tinct from UCI's policy regarding satisfactory academic progress. UC IRVINE - 1996-19971. Grade Point Average (GPA).

NOTE: Undergraduate and graduate students who enroll in more than the minimum number of units required per quarter in the first and second years will have the additional units carried forward for the cumulative total. 3. Quarter Limits for Eligibility. All financial aid applicants exceeding the following quarter limits will be ineligible for financial aid consideration. Stu\u00ad dents will not be granted additional quarters of eligibility solely by reason of changing their field of study or pursuing more than one major. Undergraduate students: 1. Entering freshmen are eligible for all types of financial aid for a total of 15 quarters of academic year attendance. 2. Advanced standing transfer students will have transcripts from previous postsecondary institutions evaluated to determine the number of remaining quarters of financial aid eligibility at UCI. 3. Students acquiring a second bachelor's degree will have up to six quarters of additional financial aid eligibility for a maximum of 21 quarters of under\u00ad graduate attendance. Graduate students: 1. Limited Status (California educational credential) students: four quarters of academic year attendance. 2. Limited Status (noncredential) students: four quarters of academic year attendance. 3. Master's degree designed for completion in: a. three quarters: five \u00b7quarters of academic year attendance. b. six quarters: eight quarters of academic year attendance. c. nine quarters: eleven quarters of academic year attendance. 4.

Required remedial courses will count toward the undergraduate, graduate, and medical student minimum unit/clock-hour requirement of the satisfactory academic progress policy for financial aid. 2. Grade evaluation. As defined below, units for the following grades will not be counted toward meeting the minimum unit/clock-hour requirement. Undergraduate and graduate students: F (Failure), I (Incomplete), NP (Not Pass), U (Unsatisfactory), W (Withdraw), NR (No grade reported), Repeat courses (Repeat of a D grade or higher; repeat of an advanced standing or high school course). Medical students: F (Failure), NR (No grade reported), Repeat courses (Repeat of a D grade or higher). 3. Incomplete courses-medical students. Clock-hours for a grade of Incomplete (I) will be counted toward satisfactory academic progress for the quarter/quintile during which the student took the course. If the student fails to meet the requirements for removing the I and the I becomes a grade ofF, the clock-hours for that course will be deleted retroactively from the stu\u00ad dent's satisfactory academic progress record. 4. Courses in progress-medical students. Clock-hours for courses In Progress (IP) will be counted toward satisfactory academic progress during the first quarter/quintile of a course requiring more than two quarters/quin\u00ad tiles for completion. Should the student fail to receive a passing grade, after the course has been completed the clock-hours for that course will be deleted retroactively from the student's satisfactory academic progress record. Deficiencies in Satisfactory Academic Progress and Their Effect on Receiving Financial Aid The requirements for undergraduate and graduate student satisfactory acade\u00ad mic progress stated above are monitored each quarter and at the end of each academic year. Students who fail to maintain satisfactory academic progress will have their financial aid eligibility affected in the following manner. 1. Quarterly totals-unit and GPA a. A total below the minimum cumulative GPA total: Students are placed on Satisfactory Academic Progress probation for the remainder of the academic year. They are able to receive financial aid funds for that academic year but the GPA deficiency must be cleared by the end of spring quarter or the end of summer session. Eligibility for the following ac\"ademic year will be dependent upon clearing the GPA deficiency. Note: GPA deficiencies must be cleared at a University of California campus. b. Unit deficiencies: i. Enrolled in less than the minimum units required but at least six per quarter. Students are placed on Satisfactory Academic Progress probation for the remainder of the academic year. They are able to receive financial aid funds for that academic year but the unit deficiency must be cleared by the end of spring quarter or the end of summer session. Eligibility for the follow\u00ad ing academic year will be dependent upon clearing the unit deficiency. ii. Enrolled in less than six units per quarter. Students are placed on Satisfactory Academic Progress probation for the remainder of the academic year. They are able to receive campus-based financial aid funds for that acad\u00ad emic year but the unit deficiency must be cleared by the end of spring quarter or the end of summer session. Eligibility for the following academic year will be dependent upon clearing the unit deficiency. 2. Academic year totals-units and GPA. The Financial Aid Office will ver\u00ad ify the cumulative totals for units and GPA atter the conclusion of spring quarter. Students who have unit or GPA deficiencies will be required to make up the deficiency prior to receiving any financial aid funds, including funds that would also be used for payment of fees. 3. Quarter limits of eligibility. At the end of the quarter students will be notified by the Financial Aid Office if they are nearing the quarter limit of eligibility for financial aid. The notice will indicate how many quarters of eligibility remain. Students also will be notified when they have completed the maximum number of quarters of eligibility for financial aid. Satisfactory Academic Progress Appeals After failure to maintain satisfactory academic progress, a student will be considered for financial aid only when one of the following conditions has been met: (a) sufficient units/clock-hours have been completed and/or the minimum cumulative GPA requirement has been satisfied, or (b) it is estab\u00ad lished through the financial aid appeals process that the student encountered some type of extenuating circumstances during the quarter(s) in question which hindered academic performance (i.e., prolonged hospitalization, death in the family). UC IRVINE - 1996-199738 UCI 1996-97 Preadmission Matters Appeals Procedure Students wishing to appeal must submit the UCI Financial Aid Appeal Request Form and a letter to the Financial Aid Office stating their reasons for failing to meet the unit, clock-hour, or GPA progress requirements, and whether or not they have solved their difficulties. Undergraduate and gradu\u00ad ate students may seek the assistance of the University Ombudsman in the preparation of appeals. Medical-students may seek the assistance of the Asso\u00ad ciate Dean of Student and Resident Affairs in the preparation of appeals. They may also be required to submit a degree check, course plan, or letter from their dean. Undergraduate Students-All relevant material will be presented to the Financial Aid Appeals Board (the Board is composed of Financial Aid pro\u00ad fessional staff). Once material has been reviewed, the Board will decide whether eligibility for aid will be reinstated. In the event the Board decides not to accept an appeal, the student will be given the right to a personal inter\u00ad view with the Board. If the student decides to exercise this right, a final rec\u00ad ommendation based upon the interview and written material will be made by the Board and forwarded to the Assistant Vice Chancellor of Financial Aid for a final decision. Graduate Students-Appeals are reviewed by (I) the Graduate Advisor of the student's advanced degree program and (2) the Dean of Graduate Studies, who will make the final recommendations to the Assistant Vice Chancellor of Financial Aid for a final decision. Medical Students-All relevant materials will be presented to the Committee on Promotions and Honors. If the Committee, after consideration of the appeal, determines that the appeal should be approved, its decision will be forwarded to the Assistant Vice Chancellor of Financial Aid and aid will be reinstated. In the event the appeal is denied by the Committee, the student will be given the right to a personal interview with the Committee. The Com\u00ad mittee will forward the final decision to the Assistant Vice Chancellor of Financial Aid for implementation. Scholarships Scholarships are awarded on the basis of academic ability, achieve\u00ad ment, and promise. They do not require repayment. Although a few honorary scholarships are awarded on the basis of academic excel\u00ad lence alone, many also require that an applicant demonstrate finan\u00ad cial need. UCI offers students with proven high academic achieve\u00ad ment and leadership potential seven top honors awards: Regents', University, Chancellor's Club, Alumni Association, Scholar's Cir\u00ad cle, UC Irvine Scholar, or UCI Foundation Scholarships. The scholarships have stipends which range from $250 to full in-state fees; or, in the case of Regents' Scholarships, provide full demon\u00ad strated need. Entering Freshman and Transfer Students Students who are entering UCI in the fall must complete the schol\u00ad arship section of the UC Application for Undergraduate Admission and Scholarships and submit the application by November 30. The Financial Aid Office automatically collects information about applicants' scholarship qualifications. Applications that meet the requirements are reviewed by the Faculty Committee on Under\u00ad graduate Scholarships, Honors, and Financial Aid. Information about the Alumni Scholarship is available in the UC Application for Undergraduate Admission and Scholarships. Continuing UCI Students Academic records of all current UCI students also are reviewed. Continuing students who meet the qualification requirements are invited to apply. Applications are reviewed by the Faculty Commit\u00ad tee on Undergraduate Scholarships, Honors, and Financial Aid. Restrictive Endowment Scholarships Eligibility requirements for Restrictive Endowment Scholarships vary greatly and are restricted in terms of such student characteris\u00ad tics as geographic location, family background, academic major, and career goals. For the most part, these scholarship awards are based on the student's established financial need. All UCI students will be considered for Restrictive Endowment Scholarships based upon information from the UC Application for Undergraduate Admission and Scholarships and their current academic records. Regents' Scholarships Regents' scholarships, among the highest honors conferred upon UC students, are awarded on the basis of academic excellence and exceptional promise. Undergraduate students are eligible upon graduation from high school or upon completion of the sophomore year of college. Medical students are eligible during any year of their study in medical school. The scholarship is awarded both as an honorarium and a stipend. It may be renewed for an additional one or three years depending on the year of appointment, provided the student completes an average of 12 units per quarter and main\u00ad tains a grade point average of at least 3.0. The honorarium is based upon year of appointment as a Regents' Scholar and is awarded without reference to financial need. The amount of the stipend will vary depending on the student's established financial need. University Scholarships University scholarships are offered to students entering their fresh\u00ad man year who show evidence of high scholastic attainment. Stu\u00ad dents who demonstrate financial need may receive stipends funded by The Regents of the University of California. These stipends may be renewed by completing the application process and demon- strating financial need. \u00b7 National Merit Scholarships UCI is a sponsor of the National Merit Scholarship.

UC IRVINE - 1996-1997These federal grants range from $100 to $4,000 per year, depend\u00ad ing upon financial need. UC Grant-In-Aid (GIA) is funded by The Regents of the Univer\u00ad sity of California and by the State of California and provides grant aid for full-time students who demonstrate financial need. The amount awarded depends upon financial need. Loans Loans are often part of a financial aid award. They provide recipi\u00ad ents with an opportunity to defer the cost of their education by borrowing when needed and paying later. However, loan recipients must pay interest on the amount borrowed. The deferment and can\u00ad cellation provisions for the loans listed below are contained on the promissory note each recipient must sign and also may be obtained from the Financial Aid Office. A student's loan responsibilities, prior to acceptance of the loan, are to understand the terms of the loan and participate in an entrance interview. After accepting the loan, the recipient must repay the loan in accordance with the repayment schedule, advise the Financial Services Office upon leaving UCI; participate in an exit interview; and provide the Financial Services Office with a current address after leaving UCI. In case of death or total disabil\u00ad ity, outstanding loan obligations may be canceled upon presenta\u00ad tion of official confirming documents. Federal Perkins Loan (formerly National Direct Student Loan) provides long-term federal loans for U.S. citizens and eligible noncitizens. The amounts awarded vary, depending on financial need, but cannot exceed $3,000 annually for undergraduates and $5,000 annually for graduate students.

UC IRVINE - 1996-1997UNDERGRADUATE ADMISSIONS The Office of Admissions and Relations with Schools is responsible for the admission of new undergraduate freshman and transfer stu\u00ad dents. Inquiries may be addressed to the Office of Admissions and Relations with Schools, 204 Administration Building, University of California, Irvine, CA 92697-1075; telephone (714) 824-6703. The Office is open from 8:00a.m. to 5:00p.m., Monday through Friday. The information on admission to UCI given below is organized as follows: Categories of Application Admission as a Freshman Applicant Admission to the University Program for High School Scholars Admission as a Transfer Applicant Nonresident Admission Requirements Admission of International Students Advanced Placement Credit Application Procedures Categories of Application An undergraduate applicant is a student who wishes to complete a program of study leading to a Bachelor of Arts, Bachelor of Music, or Bachelor of Science degree. A freshman applicant is a student who has graduated from high school or has completed a California Certificate of Proficiency, an equivalent proficiency examination from another state, or the Gen\u00ad eral Educational Development (GED) Certificate, but has not enrolled in a regular session of any collegiate-level institution. Summer sessions immediately following graduation are excluded in the determination of freshman status. The University considers a transfer applicant as a student who has completed high school and who has been a registered student in a regular session of a college or university. Students who meet this definition cannot disregard their college record and apply as freshmen. To be considered as a California community college transfer applicant to UCI, a student must have earned at least 28 semester units from a California community college in the last two regular terms of enrollment. A nonresident applicant is a student whose legal permanent resi\u00ad dence (as determined by the University) is outside of the State of California. Nonresident applicants are generally required to pay Nonresident Tuition and must also present a higher grade point average than is required of California residents. Refer to the Non\u00ad resident Admission Requirements section for further information. An applicant for readmission is a student who was formerly regis\u00ad tered and enrolled at UCI and who has interrupted the completion of consecutive quarters of enrollment. See Readmission: Under\u00ad graduate and Graduate Students. A second baccalaureate applicant is a college graduate who because of a change of objective wishes to obtain a second bache\u00ad lor's degree in a major different from that of the first degree. An international applicant is a student who holds or expects to hold a student, exchange, visitor, or diplomatic visa and who wishes to attend school in the United States. A University Program for High School Scholars (UPHSS) appli\u00ad cant is an accelerated high school student who wishes to pursue a particular subject beyond the level offered by the high school or perhaps an area of interest not offered by the high school in which the student meets the necessary prerequisites. Participants are offi\u00ad cially registered UCI students who enroll in the same courses and are evaluated on the same basis as full-time undergraduates. UPHSS students enroll-in one or two UCI courses on a reduced-fee basis concurrently with their high school courses. Undergraduate Admissions 41 Admission as a Freshman Applicant The undergraduate admissions policy of the University of Califor\u00ad nia is guided by the University's commitment to serve the people of California and the needs of the State, within the framework of the California Master Plan for Higher Education. The University's entrance requirements follow the guidelines set forth in the Master Plan, which specify that the top one-eighth of the State's high school graduates be el(gible for admission to the University of California. These requirements, described in detail in the Basic Eligibility Requirements section, are designed to ensure that all eligible students are adequately prepared for University work. Meeting eligibility requirements entitles an applicant to be consid\u00ad ered for admission but does not constitute an offer of admission. Since at UCI, as at most University of California campuses, the number of eligible applicants exceeds the number of spaces avail\u00ad able, the campus uses selection criteria which are more demanding than minimum UC eligibility requirements. Academic qualifica\u00ad tions are foremost, with 60 percent of freshman applicants selected solely on traditional academic criteria, all test scores, and high school grade point average. To attain a student body that meets the University's high academic standards and reflects the cultural, geo\u00ad graphic, economic, and social diversity of California, the remain\u00ad ing 40 percent of successful applicants are admitted on criteria which supplement the student's scholarly qualifications and which demonstrate academic backgrounds and motivation not reflected by the indices alone. These selection procedures are described in the Selection Criteria section. SELECTION CRITERIA All applicants from high school are ranked on a Selection Index which sums (a) the grade point average (multiplied by 1,000) attained on all high school academic courses, plus scores on (b) the SAT I (or the ACT equivalent), and (c) the three required SAT II examinations. Additional emphasis is placed on the strength of the curriculum which the applicant has elected, and has projected through the senior year. Admitted applicants should satisfy all pub\u00ad lished UC admission requirements prior to enrolling, and are expected to improve or maintain the level of performance reported in the application through the eleventh grade. Academic Criteria . Sixty percent of freshman applicants to be admitted are identified solely on traditional criteria utilized in the Selection Index above. In the case that UCI is unable to accommodate all qualified applicants in their first-choice major, students may be offered admission in another major. Therefore, all applicants are encouraged to indicate an alternate major on their UC Appli\u00ad cation for Admission. Students who wish to change their major after enrolling at UCI must file a change of major petition. Engineering: Preference will be given to applicants who have four years of mathematics and who rank highest using the academic criteria. Biological Sciences: There is a restriction on the number of appli\u00ad cants admitted directly into the major. Generally, preference is given to those who rank highest using the academic criteria. Psychology and Social Behavior (School of Social Ecology): There is a restriction on the number of applicants admitted directly into the major. Generally, preference is given to those who rank highest using the academic criteria. Supplemental Criteria The remaining 40 percent of freshmen applicants to be admitted will be of lower Selection Index ranking, but their academic crite\u00ad ria will be augmented by evidence of academic backgrounds and motivation not adequately reflected by the Index. These include an UC IRVINE - 1996-199742 UCI 1996-97 Preadmission Matters exceptionally challenging curriculum; accomplishments relevant to academic aims; a thoughtful match between UCI's offerings and the student's objectives; potential contributions to the campus; hard\u00ad ships, disabilities, or origins which have restricted the development of potential; and constraints on feasible educational alternatives. BASIC ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS The University defines a freshman applicant as a student who has graduated from high school or completed a California Certificate of Proficiency, or the General Educational Development (GED) examination, and who has not enrolled in a regular session of any collegiate-level institution. Summer sessions are excluded in the determination. Freshman applicants who are not residents of California should refer to the Nonresident Admission Requirements section. Applicants who do not meet the requirements for admission at the time of high school graduation may be considered after they meet the requirements for admission in advanced standing (see Admis\u00ad sion as a Transfer Applicant). Transfer credit will be granted for an acceptable course from an accredited college or university taken while still in high school if reported on a valid transcript issued by the college which conducted the course. REQUIREMENTS To be eligible for admission to the University as a freshman, an applicant must meet the Subject, Scholarship, and Examination requirements. It is also possible to qualify for admission by exami\u00ad nation alone, as explained in the Admission by Examination Alone section. Meeting basic eligibility requirements entitles an applicant to be considered for admission but does not constitute an offer of admission. 1. UC Subject Requirement The UC subject requirement consists of several courses from six core subjects. These required courses are called the \"a through f' subjects. Students are required to complete 15 \"a through f' sub\u00ad jects as described below. (A one-year course is equal to one unit; a one-semester course is equal to one-half unit.) Also, at least seven of the 15 units must have been earned in courses taken during the last two years of high school. To meet the subject requirement, these courses must appear on a certified cour_se list which is avail\u00ad able in the high schools for California applicants. The Office of Admissions and Relations with Schools will review and accept courses that meet the requirements for applicants graduating from out-of-State schools. \"A through F\" Course Requirements a. History/Social Science: 2 years required. Two years of his\u00ad tory/social science, including one year of U.S. history or one\u00ad half year of U.S. history and one-half year of civics or Ameri\u00ad can government; and one year of world history, cultures, and geography. b. English: 4 years required. Four years of college-preparatory English composition and literature. (All English courses must require frequent and regular writing and reading of classic and modern literature, poetry, and drama. Only two semesters of a certified English-as-a-second\u00ad language [ESL] course will be accepted. Also, not more than two semesters of ninth-grade English will be accepted for this requirement.) c. Mathematics: 3 years required; 4 recommended. Three years of mathematics elementary algebra, geometry, and advanced (second-year) algebra. (Mathematics courses taken in grades 7 and 8 may be used to meet part of this requirement if they are accepted by the high school as equivalent to its own courses.) d. Laboratory Science: 2 years required; 3 recommended. Two one-year courses in laboratory science providing knowledge in at least two of the fundamental disciplines of biology, chemistry, and physics. Two years of an integrated sciences program are acceptable provided the courses cover the basic concepts of two of the three fundamental disciplines. Laboratory courses in earth/space sciences are acceptable if they have as prerequisites or provide basic knowledge in biology, chemistry, or physics. Not more than one year of ninth-grade laboratory science can be used to meet this requirement. e. Language Other Than English: 2 years required; \u00b73 recom\u00ad mended. Two years of a single language other than English in which there is substantial literature. Courses should emphasize speaking and understanding, and include instruction in grammar, vocabulary, reading, and composition. (Language other than English courses taken in grades 7 and 8 may be used to meet this requirement if they are accepted by the high school as equivalent to its own courses. Students are strongly encouraged to complete three or four years of one language in preparation for the UCI language other than English breadth requirement.) f. College-Preparatory Electives: 2 years required. Two units (four semesters), in addition to those required in the \"a-e\" requirements chosen from the following areas: visual and per\u00ad forming arts, history, social science, English, advanced mathe\u00ad matics, laboratory science, and languages other than English-a third year in the language used for the \"e\" requirement or two years of another language. The general objective of the elective program is to improve the student's analytical ability, promote their artistic development, and strengthen their oral and writing skills. Electives should involve considerable reading and writing in an amount appropri\u00ad ate to the course and the subject matter. The emphasis in elec\u00ad tive courses should be to prepare for future college-level work. Courses Satisfying the \"f\" Requirement: History: All history courses should require extensive reading and writing. Courses should enable students to establish a breadth of understanding of history (for example, world history, political his\u00ad tory, or economic history) and should provide an understanding of the human past, including its relation to the present. Courses should develop a student's critical thinking, ability to evaluate his\u00ad torical data, and ability to analyze and synthesize evidence. English: All English courses should require substantial reading with frequent and extensive practice in writing which is carefully evaluated and criticized. A course in journalism, speech, debate, or drama is acceptable if it meets the rigor in reading and writing stated above. An advanced-level course in English as a second lan\u00ad guage may be acceptable provided it meets the standards outlined under the \"b\" requirement. Advanced Mathematics: Courses in mathematics with second-year algebra as a prerequisite such as trigonometry, linear algebra, pre\u00ad calculus (analytic geometry and mathematical analysis), calculus, combinatorics, probability, and statistics are acceptable electives. A computer science course is an acceptable mathematics elective if it fulfills the following objectives. The course should enable each student to express algorithms in a standard computer language such as Pascal, BASIC, FORTRAN, or COBOL. By the end of the course each student should complete substantial programming pro\u00ad jects in the language used. The course should also involve the study and mastery of various aspects of computer science: how UC IRVINE - 1996-1997computers deal with data and instructions, the internal components of a computer, and the underlying computer logic. Laboratory Science: A laboratory science course should be a course in the biological or physical sciences in which students make their own observations and measurements and analyze these data to obtain further information. On average the laboratory activ\u00ad ities should involve an amount of time equivalent to at least one full class period per week. An introductory science course normally offered in the ninth grade is an acceptable science elective provided it is designed to prepare students for laboratory science courses in the tenth grade and . beyond. The course must provide an introduction to the fundamen\u00ad tal principles of physical and biological science. Laboratory activi\u00ad ties as defined above shall be included. (A terminal course designed only to meet graduation requirements is not an acceptable science elective.) Language Other Than English: It is recommended that elective courses be in the same language used to satisfy the language other than English \"e\" subject requirement. Elective courses in this lan\u00ad guage must have at least two years of the language as prerequisite. In order for a second language to qualify as an elective, at least two years of this language must be completed. Social Science: Courses should be in one of the social sciences: anthropology, economics, geography, political science, psychology, or sociology, or, alternatively, courses should be interdisciplinary, drawing knowledge from two or more of these fields. Course objec\u00ad tives should include as many of the following as are applicable to the field: (1) to understand the development and basic features of major societies and cultures, (2) to examine the historic and con\u00ad temporary ideas that have shaped the world, (3) to understand the fundamentals of how differing political and economic systems func\u00ad tion, (4) to examine the nature and principles of individual and group behavior, and (5) to study social science methodologies. In order to develop a student's critical thinking, ability to evaluate ideas and information, and ability to analyze and synthesize quali\u00ad tative and quantitative evidence in the laboratory and in the field, a social science course must include a body of basic knowledge, extensive reading, and written and oral exposition. Courses which are designed to meet State-mandated social studies graduation requirements are acceptable provided that they meet the above criteria. Courses of an applied, service, or vocational charac\u00ad ter are not acceptable social science electives. Visual and Performing Arts: Courses in this area consist of instruction in dance, drama/theatre, music, and the visual arts. Courses should give specific attention to as many of the fundamen\u00ad tal arts components as possible, including the perceptual, the cre\u00ad ative, the historical, or the critical as are applicable. Courses should enable students to understand and appreciate artis\u00ad tic expression and, where appropriate, to talk and write with dis\u00ad crimination about the artistic material studied. Courses devoted to developing creative artistic ability and those devoted to artistic per\u00ad formance should have prerequisites (either course work or experi\u00ad ence approved by the instructor) and should assume proficiency beyond the introductory level. Courses must require on average the equivalent of a five-period class per week. Work outside of class must be required; for exam\u00ad ple, portfolio/performance preparation, reading, writing, or critical listening/viewing. Dance courses offered for physical education credit or under any other departmental arrangement are acceptable provided they include content satisfying the above criteria. Courses which are primarily athletic, or body conditioning are not acceptable visual and performing arts electives. Undergraduate Admissions 43 2. Scholarship Requirement Applicants who attain a minimum grade point average of 3.30 (where the letter grade A= 4, B = 3, and C = 2) in \"a through f' subjects taken after the ninth grade will be considered eligible for admission to the University regardless of their scores on the stan\u00ad dardized tests used for the examination requirement. Applicants whose grade point average is below 3.30 but above 2.81 are eligi\u00ad ble to be considered for admission if they achieve the composite or total test score specified on the Eligibility Index. The grade point average will be based on semester grades, unless a high school gives only year grades. (Grades earned in ninth grade or earlier are not used to calculate the grade point average for admission; how\u00ad ever, these courses will be used to meet the subject requirement if they are completed with grades of C or better.) Freshman appli\u00ad cants may be required to present academic qualifications beyond those described here. Applicants should have earned grades of C or better in meeting the subject requirement. Any \"a through f' course in which a student received aD or F grade must be repeated with a higher grade or, in sequential areas of mathematics, chemistry, and language other than English, only validated by completion of advanced course work. (Applicants should consult with their counselors as to how these grades can be remedied and how the University will use them in the evaluation of the high school record.) Honors-Level Courses. Advanced Placement courses, higher-level courses offered through the International Baccalaureate Program, courses certified by the University as honors courses, and college courses in the \"a through f' college preparatory subjects that are transferable are examples of honors-level courses. The University assigns extra grade points for up to four units of honors-level courses taken in the last three years of high school. NOTE: No more than two units of honors-level courses taken in grade 10 may be assigned extra points. Grades in honors courses will be counted as follows: A = 5 points, B = 4 points, and C = 3 points. Grades of D are not assigned extra points. To be counted, these grades must have been earned in University-approved honors-level courses in history, English, advanced mathematics, laboratory science, lan\u00ad guage other than English, computer science, social science, and the visual and performing arts. 3. Examination Requirements All freshman applicants must submit examination scores as described below. Students applying for admission for fall quarter should complete their examination requirements during May or June of their junior year or during their senior year, but no later than the December test date. (Typically, this means that students will take either the Scholastic Assessment Test I or the American College Test in October or November, and will take the Scholastic Assessment Test II in November or December.) Scores from earlier dates will be accepted. Applicants must ensure that reports for all scores have been submitted directly to the UCI Office of Admis\u00ad sions and Relations with Schools. The following examinations are required: 1. One Aptitude Test, either: a. The Scholastic Assessment Test I: Reasoning Test (SAT I): the verbal and mathematical reasoning scores submitted from this test must be from the same sitting; or b. The American College Test (ACT) composite score and 2. Three Scholastic Assessment Test II: Subject Tests (SAT II) examinations, which must include (a) writing, (b) math, level 1, 1 C, or 2C, and (c) one from among English literature, language other than English, sciences, or social studies. The SAT II exam\u00ad ination in Literature may not be substituted for the Writing Test. UC IRVINE - 1996-199744 UCI 1996-97 Preadmission Matters Admission by Examination Alone Astudent can qualify as a freshman by examination alone. The required total score on the SAT I is 1,4001. (If the ACT is pre\u00ad sented, the minimum score is 31.) Also, the student's total score on the three SAT II examinations must be 1,7602 or higher, or at least 1,8503 if a nonresident of California, with no score less than 5304 on any individual SAT II examination. This option does not apply to students who will have completed more than 12 transferable units prior to admission. The SAT II examinations cannot be taken in academic subjects covered by transferable college courses a stu\u00ad dent may have taken. Freshman applicants who qualify for admis\u00ad sion by examination alone may be required to present academic qualifications in addition to the test scores listed above. I 1,300 if taken prior to April1995. 2 1,650 if taken prior to May 1995. 3 1,730 if taken prior to May 1995. 4 500 if taken prior to May 1995.

Use the first score listed if the SAT I was taken prior to April 1995. Use the second score if the test was taken April 1995 or later. Admission to the University Program for High School Scholars (UPHSS) The opportunity to enroll in University classes concurrent, usually, with the senior year of high school is available to certain acceler\u00ad ated students. Admission to UPHSS is based upon a combination of criteria including grades, specific preparation in the field of interest, standardized test scores, recommendations, and statement of purpose. Through UPHSS, qualified high school students may enroll in UCI courses, receive grades based on the same standards as full-time students, and receive full University of California credit for their work. To continue at UCI after high school graduation, a UPHSS student need only complete a change-of-major petition and enroll as a full\u00ad time student. The change of major petition must be filed with the Registrar by the third week of the quarter prior to full-time enroll\u00ad ment. Graduation requirements (UC, UCI, school, and major) for UPHSS students will be determined by the year of the first enroll\u00ad ment in a course as a UPHSS student. However, regulations limit\u00ad ing the ways in which matriculated students may fulfill the writing requirements (Subject A, lower-and upper-division) do not apply to UPHSS students until they enroll as regular UCI students after high school graduation. If the UPHSS participant wishes to attend another University of California campus, the student must follow the regular admissions process and must complete a UC Undergraduate Application. High school students wishing more information about the program should contact the Office of Admissions and Relations with Schools or their high school counselor. Admission as a Transfer Applicant The University defines a transfer applicant as a student who has completed high school and who has been a registered student in another college or university or in college-level extension classes other than a summer session immediately following high school graduation. UCI considers a California community college transfer applicant as a student who has earned at least 28 semester units from a California community college in the last two regular terms of enrollment. A transfer applicant may not disregard the college record and apply for admission as a freshman. (Transfer applicants who are not residents of California should also refer to the section on Nonresident Admission Requirements.) SELECTION CRITERIA UCI attempts to accommodate as many qualified transfer applicants as possible, particularly as juniors. However, in circumstances where selectivity beyond UC eligibility is required, selection of the majority of transfer applicants is based upon GPA, transferable units, level of entry, type of school or origin, and depth of prepara\u00ad tion for the major. Highest priority for admission is given to Cali\u00ad fornia-resident junior-level applicants from California Community Colleges. Junior transfers from four-year colleges, including other UC campuses, and lower-division transfers may be considered as space permits. Transfer applicants must complete required English composition and mathematics courses by the end of the term pre\u00ad ceding enrollment at UCI (not including summer session). In the case that UCI is unable to accommodate all qualified appli\u00ad cants in their first-choice major, those students who indicate a valid alternate major may be offered admission in that major. Stu\u00ad dents who wish to change their major after enrolling at UCI must file a change of major petition. This is of particular importance to those who apply in majors which are subject to additional course prerequisites and/or have a limit placed on the number of applicants admitted into the major. (See below.) Biological Sciences: A student seeking admission to the School of Biological Sciences from colleges and schools other than UCI must satisfy the University requirements for admission to advanced standing. Preference will be given to junior-level applicants with the highest grades overall, and who have satisfactorily completed the following required courses: a year of general chemistry with laboratory, an approved sequence of biological science courses, and an approved lower-division course in writing. Chemistry: Preference will be given to junior-level applicants with the highest grades overall, and who have satisfactorily com\u00ad pleted the following required courses: one year of approved calcu\u00ad lus and one year of general chemistry with laboratory. UC IRVINE - 1996-1997Economics: Preference will be given to junior-level applicants with the highest grades overall, and who have satisfactorily com\u00ad pleted the following required courses: one-year of microeconomic and macroeconomic theory, a semester or two quarter courses of calculus, and an approvc:d lower-division course in writing. Engineering: Applicants must select either Aerospace Engineering, Chemical Engineering, Civil Engineering, Computer Engineering, Electrical Engineering, Engineering (a general program of study which is open to upper-division students only), Environmental Engineering, or Mechanical Engineering as their major on the appli\u00ad cation. Preference will be given to junior-level applicants with the highest grades overall, and who have satisfactorily completed the following required courses: one year of calculus, one year of engi\u00ad neering physics with laboratory, one semester or one year of general chemistry (whichever is required for the major), one course in com\u00ad putational methods, and one year of approved lower-division writ\u00ad ing. See the School of Engineering section of this Catalogue for information on courses required for junior academic standing. Information and Computer Science: Preference will be given to applicants with the highest grades overall, and who have satisfacto\u00ad rily completed the following required course work: one year of dis\u00ad crete mathematics or calculus, one year of computer science including a programming course in a modern high-level language (such as ADA, C, c++, Pascal), and an approved lower-division course in writing. Mathematics: Preference will be given to junior-level applicants with the highest grades overall, and who have satisfactorily com\u00ad pleted the required course work of one year of approved calculus. Physics: Preference will be given to junior-level applicants with the highest grades overall, and who have satisfactorily completed the following required courses: one year of approved calculus and one year of calculus-based physics with laboratory. Psychology and Social Behavior (School of Social Ecology): There is a limitation on the number of applicants admitted to the major. Generally, preference is given to junior-level applicants with the highest grades overall. TRANSFER STUDENT ADMISSION REQUIREMENTS The requirements for admission as a transfer applicant vary according to the high school record. Transfer applicants who have completed a California Certificate of Proficiency or the equivalent must also meet regular University. entrance requirements. Transfer applicants should also refer to the section on Information for Transfer Students: Fulfilling Requirements for a Bachelor's Degree. NOTE: New eligibility requirements take effect with students who will transfer to the University in fall 1998. The new requirements follow the current requirements listed below. The transcript submitted from the last college attended must show, as a minimum, that the student was in good standing and had earned a grade point average of 2.00 or better in all transferable course work. Applicants planning to transfer prior to fall 1998 must also meet one of the following conditions: 1. A student who met the Eligibility Index and completed all the \"a through f' courses in high school may meet minimum eligi\u00ad bility requirements after establishing an overall grade point average of 2.00 or better. If a student has completed less than 12 quarter or semester units of transferable college credit since high school graduation, the student must also satisfy the exami\u00ad nation requirement for freshmen. Undergraduate Admissions 45 2. A student who met the Eligibility Index but had not studied one or more of the required courses in high school may meet mini\u00ad mum eligibility to transfer after the student has: a. established an overall grade point average of 2.00 or better in another college or university; and b. completed, with a grade of C or better, appropriate college courses in the high school subjects lacked; and c. completed 12 or more quarter or semester transferable units, or met the examination requirement for freshmen. 3. A student who was not eligible for admission as a freshman because the Eligibility Index was not met or who both failed to meet the Eligibility Index and lacked required subjects may meet minimum eligibility requirements after the student has: a. established an overall grade point average of 2.40 or better in another college or university; and b. completed 84 quarter units (56 semester units) of college credit in courses accepted by the University for transfer; and c. completed one of the following two options: i. With a grade of Cor better, (1) one transferable course in English composition; (2) one transferable course selected from U.S. history, a laboratory science, or a language other than English; (3) courses equivalent to high school elementary algebra, advanced algebra, and geometry; or a nontransferable two-semester-unit or three-quarter-unit course in trigonometry; or a transferable mathematics course that employs the topics of intermediate algebra; or a transferable statistics course that has intermediate algebra as a prerequisite. NOTE: For UCI, in fulfilling this option, the courses in Eng\u00ad lish and mathematics should be completed no later than the term indicated below: Applicants for: Fall Winter Spring Term completed by: Spring Summer Fall ii. Appropriate college courses, with grades of C or better in the \"a through f' subjects that the student lacked. Up to two units of high school work in \"a through f' subjects will be waived, but transfer applicants must have satisfied the fresh\u00ad man admission requirements of four years of college-prepara\u00ad tory English and three years of mathematics (part of the \"a through f' requirements). Applicants planning to transfer fall 1998 and thereafter must also meet one of the following conditions: 1. Students who were eligible for admission to the University when they graduated from high school-meaning they satisfied the Subject, Scholarship, and Examination Requirements-are eligible to transfer if they have a C (2.0) average in their trans\u00ad ferable college course work. 2. Students who met the Scholarship Requirement but did not sat\u00ad isfy the Subject Requirement must take transferable college courses in the subjects they are missing, earn a grade of C or better in each of these required courses, and earn an overall C (2.0) average in all transferable college course work to be eligi\u00ad ble to transfer. Students who met the Scholarship Requirement but did not meet the Examination Requirement must complete a minimum of 12 semester (18 quarter) units of transferable work and earn an overall C (2.0) average in all transferable college course work completed. 3. Students who were not eligible for admission to the University when they graduated from high school because they did not meet the Scholarship Requirement must: UC IRVINE - 1996-199746 UCI 1996-97 Preadmission Matters a. Complete 90 quarter units or 60 semester units of transferable college credit with a grade point average of at least 2.4, and b. Complete a course pattern requirement to include: i. Two transferable college courses (3 semester or 4-5 quar\u00ad ter units each) in English composition; and ii. One transferable college course (3 semester or 4-5 quarter units) in mathematical concepts and quantitative reasoning; and iii. Four transferable college courses (3 semester or 4-5 quarter units each) chosen from at least two of the following subject areas: the arts and humanities, the social and behavor\u00ad ial sciences, the physical and biological sciences. ADMISSION FOR A SECOND BACHELOR'S DEGREE A student whose educational objective has changed substantially after receiving the bachelor's degree may be considered for admis\u00ad sion to a program for a second degree. Admission as a candidate for a second bachelor's degree requires that the applicant be fully eligible for admission to the University and have strong promise of academic success in the new major. All such admissions are sub\u00ad ject to the approval of the dean or director of the UCI school or program in which the second degree will be earned. Students who have not attended UCI as undergraduates during a regular academic quarter should complete an Application for Undergraduate Admission and a Supplementary Information for Second Baccalaureate Applicants form, available from the Office of Admissions and Relations with Schools. Students who have attended UCI as undergraduates during a regular academic quarter should obtain and complete a Second Baccalaureate Application form through the Registrar's Office. A Duplicate Degree Fee is charged to all enrolled second baccalau\u00ad reate students. Nonresident Admission Requirements Admission requirements for applicants who are not California resi\u00ad dents vary slightly from requirements for California residents. However, all nonresident freshman and transfer applicants are sub\u00ad ject to the same selection criteria as California residents, as explained in a previous section. NONRESIDENT FRESHMAN APPLICANT A nonresident freshman applicant must (I) graduate from a region\u00ad ally or state-accredited high school, or complete an appropriate proficiency examination; (2) complete satisfactorily the \"a through f' pattern of subject requirements listed under requirements for California residents; (3) earn a grade point average of at least 3.40 or higher in the required high school subjects (3.00 is equal to a B average); and (4) meet the examination requirement: one Aptitude Test either the SAT I (verbal and mathematical scores must be from the same sitting) or the American College Test (ACT) com\u00ad posite score, and three SAT II examinations which must include (a) writing, (b) math, Ievell, lC, or 2C, and (c) one from among English literature, language other than English, sciences, or social studies. (The SAT II examination in Literature may not be substi\u00ad tuted for the Writing test.) Please note that the Freshman Eligibility Index applies to Califor\u00ad nia residents only. To be considered for admission by examination alone, a nonresident applicant must score either 1,400 (1,300 if taken prior to Aprill995) on the SAT I or 31 on the ACT. The total score on the three SAT II examinations must be 1,850 or higher with a score of at least 530 on each test. (If the tests were taken prior to May 1995, the total score must be 1,730 or higher, with a minimum score of 500 on each test.) NONRESIDENT TRANSFER APPLICANT A student who met the admission requirements for freshman admission as a nonresident must have a grade point average of 2.80 or higher in college courses that are accepted by the Univer\u00ad sity for transfer credit. Nonresident applicants transfering prior to fall 1998. A non\u00ad resident applicant who graduated from high school with less than a 3.40 grade point average in the subjects required for freshman admission must have completed at least 84 quarter units (56 semes\u00ad ter units) of transferable work with a grade point average of 2.80 or higher. Upon successful completion of that work, two units of the required high school subjects may be waived but transfer applicants must have satisfied the freshman entrance requirements of four years of college-preparatory English and three years of mathematics (part of the \"a through f' requirements). A student who lacked any of the required subjects in high school must complete, with a grade of C or better, appropriate college courses in those subjects, or, with UC IRVINE - 1996-1997a grade of Cor better, (1) one transferable course in English com\u00ad position; (2) one transferable course selected from U.S. history, a laboratory science, or a language other than English; (3) courses equivalent to high school elementary algebra, advanced algebra, and geometry; or a course in mathematics, such as trigonometry or statistics, for which advanced algebra is a prerequisite. The mathe\u00ad matics courses do not have to be transferable. Beginning fall 1998 and thereafter, nonresident applicants must complete the 1998 transfer admission requirements found on pages 45-46 with a minimum transferable grade point average of 2.80. Nonresident Tuition Fee Refer to the Expenses and Fees section for information regarding residence classification for tuition purposes and the Nonresident Tuition Fee. ADMISSION OF INTERNATIONAL STUDENTS The credentials of an international undergraduate applicant-a stu\u00ad dent who holds or expects to hold a student, exchange, visitor, or diplomatic visa and who wishes to attend school in the United States-are evaluated in accordance with the general regulations governing admission. However, it is possible that international applicants to oversubscribed programs may not be offered admis\u00ad sion to either their first-choice campus or to another University of California campus. The application should be submitted to the Uni\u00ad versity of California Undergraduate Application Processing Service early in the appropriate application filing period. Official certifi\u00ad cates and detailed transcripts of records should be submitted directly to the UCI Office of Admissions and Relations with Schools only when requested. This will allow time for exchange of necessary correspondence and, if the applicant is admitted, will help the student in obtaining the necessary passport visa. International applicants whose native language is other than Eng\u00ad lish will be required to demonstrate their English proficiency. This is most often accomplished by achieving a minimum 'score of 550 on the Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL). The admission of otherwise eligible applicants who do not meet this requirement will be deferred until it is possible for them to demon\u00ad strate an adequate level of English ability. Arrangements to take the TOEFL may be made by writing directly to TOEFL, Educa\u00ad tional Testing Service, P.O. 6151, U.S.A.; telephone (609) 771-7100. Students must request the Educational Testing Service to forward results of their tests to the Office of Admissions and Relations with Schools. Completion of an acceptable English composition course (as determined by the Office of Admissions and Relations with Schools) with a grade of C or better will also clear the English proficiency requirement for international applicants. Students who wish to improve their English proficiency to meet the TOEFL requirement may enroll in the intensive Program in English as a Second Language sponsored by University Extension. Requests for information should be addressed to Program in Eng\u00ad lish as a Second Language, University of California Extension, P.O. Box 6050, Irvine, CA 92716-6050. See Supplementary Educa\u00ad tional Programs for additional information. In addition to achieving a minimum TOEFL score of 550, all inter\u00ad national students whose native language is other than English must take an English as a Second Language Placement Test upon arrival and prior to registration. Based upon the results of this test, stu\u00ad dents may be required to improve certain language skills by enroll\u00ad ing in English as a Second Language courses during their first year, with other major course work being adjusted accordingly. Generally, financial assistance and scholarships from the Univer\u00ad sity are not available to the nonimmigrant-visa student. Interna\u00ad tional students must provide proof that sufficient funds will be available to meet their educational commitments while studying in Undergraduate Admissions 47 the United States. International undergraduate students are consid\u00ad ered as nonresidents of California and are required to pay the non\u00ad resident tuition in addition to fees paid by legal residents of Cali\u00ad fornia. Students must also pay the International Student Health Insurance Fee, or have private insurance. See the Student Health Service section for additional information. Please direct all inquiries regarding the undergraduate admission of international students to the Office of Admissions and Relations with Schools. ENGUSHLANGUAGEPROA~ENCYOF PERMANENT RESIDENT, REFUGEE, AND INTERNATIONAL (F-1 VISA) STUDENTS: ENGLISH AS A SECOND LANGUAGE Any student (a) whose first or native language is not English, (b) who has not satisfied the Universitywide Subject A requirement, and (c) whose score on the verbal portion of the SAT I is 430 or less (350 or less if taken prior to April 1995), or any such student without a verbal SAT I score, must, regardless of the student's TOEFL (Test of English as a Foreign Language) score or TSWE (Test of Standard Written English) score, take an English as a Sec\u00ad ond Language Placement Test (ESLPT) prior to the first quarter of enrollment. Also, any student who is identified as an ESL student through the Universitywide Subject A Examination must take the ESLPT. The ESLPT is given prior to the beginning of each quarter, during Welcome Week prior to the beginning of fall quarter instruction, and on dates to be announced. Information concerning when and where the test will be given and the test itself can be obtained from the Program of Academic Support Services Office (telephone 714-824-6206) and the Office of English as a Second Language (telephone 714-824-6781). Based upon the results of the ESLPT, students may be required to enroll in ESL courses prior to enrolling in any other required writ\u00ad ing courses. Students required to enroll in ESL courses must begin satisfying their ESL requirements within their first or second quar\u00ad ter at UCI. They must take these courses in consecutive quarters. The ESL requirements are to be completed within the first six quarters at UCI. Students who have not satisfied the ESL require\u00ad ment by the end of their sixth quarter will be ineligible to enroll for a seventh quarter at UCI. Subject A must be satisfied during the quarter following the completion of ESL requirements. If the ESL requirements are completed during the first quarter of enrollment, the Subject A requirement must be satisfied before the beginning of the fourth quarter of enrollment. ESL courses, offered by the School of Humanities and listed in the School's section of this Catalogue, include classes in writing, speaking and listening, and reading and vocabulary development. CREDIT FOR ENGLISH-AS-A-SECOND-LANGUAGE COURSE WORK Students whose first language is not English may receive up to 12 baccalaureate credits for English-as-a-second-language course work. Students may receive workload credit for courses taken beyond this 12-unit limit but will not receive additional credits applicable to the bachelor's degree. CREDIT FOR NATIVE LANGUAGE Students whose first language is not English may receive credit for course work in their native language and literature, provided such courses were completed on the college level in the country of the vernacular, or on the upper-division or graduate level at UCI or another accredited English-speaking institution.

The unit and subject credit allowed toward degree requirements assigned to each test are shown iri the accompanying chart. Students cannot earn units or grade points at UCI in courses from which they have been exempted on the basis of Advanced Place\u00ad ment credit. Students who elect to enroll in courses for which they have already received Advanced Placement credit will have those courses specially coded on their transcript without unit or grade credit. However, if a student receives less than full series credit (i.e., 8 units of credit for a 12-unit series such as Art History 40A, 40B, 40C or 4 units of credit for an 8-unit series such as Mathe\u00ad matics 2A-B), the student may elect to take the final course in the series for credit. International Baccalaureate The University grants eight quarter units (five and one-third semes\u00ad ter units) of credit for each International Baccalaureate (IB) Higher Level examination on which a student scores 5 or higher. The Uni\u00ad versity does not grant credit for subsidiary level examinations. The units granted for IB examinations are not counted toward the maximum number of credits required for formal declaration of an undergraduate major or the maximum number of units a student may accumulate prior to graduation from the University. Students who enter the University with IB credit do not have to declare a major earlier than other students nor are they required to graduate earlier. Application Procedures Application packets for undergraduate admission to the University are available from the counseling office of any California high school or community college, or from any University of California Admissions Office. Students applying for admission to UCI should complete the appli\u00ad cation and submit it according to the instructions provided in the Undergraduate Application for Admission and Scholarships. A non\u00ad refundable application fee of $40 must accompany the application. This basic fee entitles the applicant to be considered at one campus; for each additional campus selected,\u00b7 an additional $40 fee is required. Applicants concerned with admission or application pro\u00ad cedure questions specific to UCI should communicate directly with the Office of Admissions and Relations with Schools, University of California, Irvine, CA 92697-1075; telephone (714) 824-6703.

WHEN TO APPLY FOR ADMISSION To ensure that applications will be considered for admission by both UCI (or other University campuses) and the student's choice of major or program of study, the completed application and the application fee should be filed during the priority filing period. Each campus accepts for consideration all applications it receives during this period. Additionally, students required to fulfill the examination requirements for freshman admission should make arrangements to take the standardized tests early. Completing the examination requirement (SAT I or ACT and three SAT II exami\u00ad nations) no later than the December testing date of the senior year of high school is strongly recommended for students applying for the fall quarter. Quarter to be Admitted at UCI Winter quarter, 1997 Spring quarter, 1997 Fall quarter, 1997 Winter quarter, 1998 Spring quarter, 1998 Priority Application Filing Dates File July 1-30, 1996 File October 1-30, 1996 File November 1-30, 1996 File July 1-30, 1997 File October 1-30, 1997 After the priority filing period has ended, campuses will accept applications only if they still have openings for new students. Students are advised to check with the Admissions Office to find out if the campus is accepting applications for winter or spring terms. ADDING A CAMPUS If the campus or campuses being considered are still accepting applications, students may, after submitting their application, add additional campus choice(s) to that or those initially listed on their application. A $40 fee for each additional campus will be required. Students should contact the Admissions Office on the campus to be added for information on which programs are still open and the procedures for adding campuses. Students should be aware that processing an additional campus choice will take several weeks before the new campus actually receives the application and data. Students should also be aware that special program commitments, such as the Educational Oppor\u00ad tunity Program or UCLA's Academic Advancement Program may vary from campus to campus. Students can communicate with the Housing or Financial Aid Office directly for information about deadlines, priorities, and availability of these services. UC IRVINE - 1996-199750 UCI 1996-97 Preadmission Matters TRANSCRIPTS The Office of Admissions and Relations with Schools requires complete, accurate, and up-to-date information about a student's academic program and work in progress in order to process and respond to the application in a timely manner. The transcript and other documents submitted as part of the application become the property of the University; they cannot be returned or forwarded in any form to another college or university. Freshman Applicants. Applicants will be notified if a preliminary high school transcript is required. Applicants are also responsible for asking testing agencies to report examination scores for either the SAT I or ACT tests and three SAT II examinations to the UCI Office of Admissions and Relations with Schools. An official final high school transcript showing a statement of graduation also must be forwarded to the campus at which the student has decided to register and enroll. Official final transcripts should arrive in the UCI Office of Admissions and Relations with Schools by July 15 for those students admitted for fall quarter. Those students entering in the winter or spring quarters must have their transcripts in the Office of Admissions and Relations with Schools within one month of the completion of the term of the school from which they entered. A California Certificate of Proficiency, the results from a proficiency test from any state, or a General Education Develop\u00ad ment (GED) Certificate can be accepted in place of a high school diploma. Transfer Applicants. Transfer students should not send transcripts unless requested to do so. It is essential that applicants accurately complete the self-reported college credit information in the appli\u00ad cation because it will be used for initial admission screening. Once students are admitted and decide to enroll at UCI, an official tran\u00ad script from each college attended and the high school from which they graduated must be sent to the Office of Admissions and Rela\u00ad tions with Schools. Unless a student is attending a summer session, final official transcripts should arrive in the UCI Office of Admis\u00ad sions and Relations with Schools by July 15 for those students admitted for the fall quarter. Summer-session transcripts must be submitted by September 15. Students entering UCI in the winter or spring quarters must have their final official transcripts sent to the Office of Admissions and Relations with Schools no later than one month after completion of the term of the school they are currently attending. EXAMINATION ARRANGEMENTS Students should make arrangements to take the required tests with the Educational Testing Service, College Board/ATP, CN 6200, Princeton, NJ 08541-6200, for SAT I and SAT II examinations. For the ACT, students should write to the American College Testing Pro\u00ad gram Registration Unit, P.O. Box 168, Iowa City, lA 52243. (Test fees should be paid to the testing services, not to the University.) At the same time the test is taken, students should request that their scores be reported to the UCI Office of Admissions and Relations with Schools. To prevent confusion or unnecessary delay, it is important to use precisely the same form of the student's name on both the application for admission and the test materials. In 1996-97 SAT I and SAT II are offered concurrently on the fol\u00ad lowing Saturday mornings: October 12, 1996; December 7, 1996; January 25, 1997; March 25, 1997 (SAT I only); May 3, 1997; and June 7, 1997. The 1996-97 ACT Tests are offered on the following dates: October 26, 1996; December 14, 1996; February 8, 1997; April12, 1997; and June 14, 1997. Details on testing are available from the College Board, the Ameri\u00ad can College Testing Program, and from most high school counseling offices. NOTIFICATION OF ADMISSION Most fall quarter freshmen applicants are notified of their status between March 1 and 31. Transfer applicants are usually notified by May 1. In some cases for transfer applicants, complete tran\u00ad scripts of course work are required before a final decision can be made; such records will be requested by the Office of Admissions and Relations with Schools. Note that these target dates apply only to those applicants who submitted their applications during the fall priority filing period (November 1-30). Those students who apply after the priority period will be notified as soon as possible after March 31. Statement of Intention to Register Students who are accepted for admission will receive, with their notification of admission, a Statement of Intention to Register (SIR) fohn. The SIR serves to notify each campus of the student's decision to accept or not accept its offer of admission. Before com\u00ad pleting and returning the form, students who have applied to more than one campus are advised to take as much time as is appropriate in considering their responses to each campus. However, it is essential that students allow enough time to meet the deadline for returning their SIR. Once they have decided on which campus to attend, students should submit their positive SIR and nonrefund\u00ad able $100 deposit (if applicable) to the campus Admissions Office. Students should not submit a positive SIR to more than one cam\u00ad pus. Additionally, once the positive SIR and fee have been received, the student cannot transfer to another UC campus. Freshman students entering in the fall quarter must return their positive SIR by May 1 or by the date indicated on the SIR. Transfer students entering in a fall quarter must return their posi\u00ad tive SIR by June 1, or by the date indicated on the SIR. Students entering in a winter or spring quarter must return the SIR by the date indicated on the SIR. Admission to UCI is not an assurance of receiving financial aid nor does it guarantee assignment to University housing. Separate applications are required of applicants desiring financial aid or University housing, and receipt of communications from the Finan\u00ad cial Aid Office, the Housing Office, or any office other than the Office of Admissions and Relations with Schools does not imply that eligibility for admission has been established. UC IRVINE - 1996-199751 UC IRVINE - 1996-1997INFORMATION FOR ADMITTED STUDENTS ORIENTATION Orientation programs include Welcome Week, held in the fall; the Student-Parent Orientation Program (SPOP), a live-in experience on campus for new students and their parents; Uni-Prep, a four-day program in August for aew students only; and various one-day pro\u00ad grams. All of these programs are sponsored by the Office of the Dean of Students, UCI Student Center; telephone (714) 824-7759. Welcome Week features a variety of academic and social activities for new and returning students and is scheduled the week prior to the beginning of fall quarter classes. Students who enroll later in the academic year (winter or spring quarter) participate in an abbreviated orientation prior to the beginning of the appropriate quarter. Student-Parent Orientation Programs (SPOP) are held three dif\u00ad ferent times during the summer. SPOP is designed to help new stu\u00ad dents with their registration materials and offers informative ses\u00ad sions on academic programs, extracurricular activities, housing choices, and much more. Participants and their parents live in resi\u00ad dence halls, and the program fee covers room, board, and program costs. Mini-SPOP and Transfer orientation programs are intensive one\u00ad day events held in July and August for students and parents who are unable to attend the multi-day programs. Uni-Prep is a four-day program for entering students held in August. Participants live in the residence halls and attend work\u00ad shops and other activities designed to provide them with informa\u00ad tion about shaping their academic and personal lives at UCI. A fee is charged that covers room, board, and program costs. Applicants for admission who plan to enroll at UCI in fall quarter will be sent information about SPOP, Mini-SPOP, and Uni-Prep in mid-May. DIVISION OF UNDERGRADUATE EDUCATION The core mission of the Division of Undergraduate Education is to provide campus leadership, programs, and services which enhance the quality of undergraduate education at UCI. An advocate and steward for educational excellence, the Division works with all acad\u00ad emic units, programs, and members of the UCI community to foster a climate of learning and discovery for every undergraduate student. Through its diverse and innovative programs and services, the Divi\u00ad sion provides support for student academic achievement, for a rich and coherent curriculum, and for outstanding teaching through the integration of teaching and research activities and the facilitation of effective pedagogy. The following programs and services are administered by the Divi\u00ad sion of Undergraduate Education: (1) the Program of Academic Support Services (PASS), whicl). coordinates the Learning Skills Center, Student Academic Advancement Services, the Testing, Research, and Evaluation Office, and the Tutorial Assistance Pro\u00ad gram; (2) the Center for International Education, which includes the Education Abroad Program and the International Opportunities Program; (3) General Programs, which includes responsibility for the coordination of general assignment classrooms, the enhance\u00ad ment of campus advising with special responsibility for the advis\u00ad ing of unaffiliated students (undecided/undeclared majors), the Peer Academic Advising Program, and the Student-Recommended Faculty Program; (4) the Campuswide Honors Program which also administers the Scholarship Opportunities Program; (5) the Committee for Instructional Development, which administers instructional improvement funds; (6) Instructional Development Services, which supports the improvement of teaching and innova\u00ad tion in learning within the UCI community; (7) Media Services, which supports campus academic programs by providing compre\u00ad hensive services relating to instructional technology; (8) Resource Center for Undergraduate Education Grants, which assists faculty to obtain grants to enhance undergraduate education; and (9) the undergraduate Research Opportunities Program, which encourages and supports research and creative activity of UCI undergraduates in conjunction with faculty members. Placement Testing UCI's Testing, Research, and Evaluation Office administers place\u00ad ment examinations to new and continuing students to ensure cor\u00ad rect placement in selected introductory courses and to help stu\u00ad dents assess their readiness for University-level work. These exams are selected or developed by UCI faculty who also determine the grading criteria for each exam. Results from placement tests are used by students and their academic counselors to formulate a plan of study which is best suited to the students' learning needs and career goals and to determine enrollment in introductory courses. Additional information, such as entrance examination scores, Advanced Placement (AP) scores, and high school work, also may be used to determine course placement. Placement examinations are given in the areas of chemistry, physics, precalculus, mathematical analysis, and English as a second language: I. Chemistry Placement Examination. Students who plan to enroll in an introductory chemistry course (Chemistry lP or lA) are required to take this examination unless otherwise exempt. 2. Physics Placement Examination. Students who plan to enroll in Physics SA are required to take this examination unless other\u00ad wise exempt. 3. Precalculus Placement Examination. Students who plan to enroll in Mathematics 2A are required to take this examination unless otherwise exempt. 4. Mathematical Analysis Examination. Students who plan to enroll in Mathematics lA or IB, or who have not had a prior course in precalculus and who plan to enroll in mathematics courses at UCI are strongly encouraged to take this examination. 5. English as a Second Language (ESL) Placement Examination. This examination is required of any student (a) whose native language is not English, (b) whose verbal score on the SAT I: Reasoning Test is 430 or less (350 or less for SAT tests taken prior to Apri11995), (c) who have not satisfied the Subject A requirement, and (d) who have received a letter from the ESL Program requiring them to take the ESL Placement Examina\u00ad tion. Scores from the Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL) and the Test of Standard Written English (TSWE) are not considered. The ESL Placement Examination also is required of students referred to the ESL Program on the basis of their score on the Universitywide Subject A Examination. See the section on Admission of International Students for additional information. All newly admitted freshmen will receive a detailed placement testing brochure describing the exams and the testing schedule for the next quarter. Students should take required exams before regis\u00ad tering for classes and should discuss their results with an academic counselor or faculty advisor. Students enrolling for the first time in UC IRVINE - 1996-1997fall quarter are strongly advised to take placement tests at the earli\u00ad est possible date (usually in May) in order to allow time to receive their results and discuss them with an academic counselor during the summer registration period and prior to enrolling in courses. For the convenience of continuing students, placement tests also are administered every quarter during the academic year; consult the Schedule of Classes for dates. Further information on placement testing and the testing schedule may be obtained by telephoning the Testing, Research, and Evalua\u00ad tion Office at (714) 824-6207 or on the World Wide Web at http:// www.ugs.uci.edu/-ugs/plt/. The Office is part of the Program of Academic Support Services (PASS), a unit of the Division of Undergraduate Education. University Subject A Examination The University of California system has established the University\u00ad wide Subject A Examination (see University Requirements). Results from this examination are used to place students in UCI writing and, if needed, ESL courses. There is a $55 nonrefundable administrative fee associated with the examination. The fee pay\u00ad ment process and waiver information are explained in materials students receive in April from the Educational Testing Service. Students who receive admission application fee waivers will auto\u00ad matically have this exam fee waived. Please refer to the section on Requirements for a Bachelor's Degree for complete information on the Universitywide Subject A Examination. Academic Advising At the time of admission to UCI every undergraduate student is assigned to the school or program that offers the student's selected major. Students who have indicated \"Undecided/Undeclared\" as a major on their UC Application for Admission receive assistance from the General Studies Advising Program (GSAP) until they select an academic major. GSAP is located in 256 Administration Building; telephone (714) 824-6987. Jurisdiction over all questions of academic regulations and acade\u00ad mic standing rests with the dean or director of the school or depart\u00ad ment to which a student is assigned or, in the case of undecided/undeclared majors, with the Dean of the Division of Undergraduate Education. Each academic unit provides academic advising for its students and processes requests to add or drop courses, waive or change graduation or other requirements, or change majors. Students are responsible for knowing the governing regulations of the school or program to which they are assigned. While each academic unit is responsible for maintaining a system which provides academic advising, these systems differ from unit to unit. In some, all of the faculty serve as advisors; in others, only certain members of the faculty are designated as advisors. All advising offices include academic counselors, professionals who assist students in planning their program, selecting a major, and making progress toward a degree. Peer academic advisors (trained upper-division students) assist students in many of the same areas as academic counselors. In addition, they are able to answer ques\u00ad tions relating to student life issues, providing a student perspective. Responsibility for informing students of the names of their advi\u00ad sors rests with the dean or chair of the appropriate academic unit. This is done normally by letter; however, students may obtain information by telephone from the office of the appropriate dean or chair. Telephone numbers for academic advising offices are listed in the academic unit sections of the Catalogue and in the Schedule of Classes. New students are encouraged to plan their academic programs with an academic counselor shortly after being admitted. The optimum time to initiate contact with an academic counselor is before the student enrolls in classes. The academic counselor can help the Division of Undergraduate Education 53 student determine whether the classes the student wishes to take are appropriate to the student's level of preparation, whether the proposed classes fit within the student's educational goals, and whether the classes will help meet some of the requirements for graduation. In some schools and programs, consultation between students and their faculty advisors is mandatory. Regardless of whether or not consultation between student and advisor is required, students are responsible for initiating and maintaining periodic contact with their assigned faculty advisor. The actual frequency of these meet\u00ad ings will be determined by the desires of the student, the advisor, and the unit's governing regulations. Each quarter, new students are required to go to the appropriate academic dean's office prior to the beginning of classes for advice concerning class enrollment. These procedures for new students and provisions for continuing students are explained in detail in the quarterly Schedule of Classes. Undecided/Undeclared Students Students who enter the University as freshmen or sophomores, who are uncertain about their major, and who wish to explore, experiment, and then decide, participate in the General Studies Advising Program (GSAP) administered by the Division of Under\u00ad graduate Education. The Division is devoted to enriching the learn\u00ad ing environment for lower-division students, especially those in the freshman year. Further information is available in the Majors and Careers section of this Catalogue. Program of Academic Support Services The Program of Academic Support Services (PASS) is a cam\u00ad puswide program designed to help students fulfill their potential and attain their academic goals at UCI. PASS offers a wide range of services and programs which are course-specific, discipline-spe\u00ad cific, or general. Services are provided in a variety of formats, including workshops, laboratories, adjunct classes, small-group tutoring, and individual conferences. The Program's services sup\u00ad plement classroom instruction. Counseling and referral services for specific student groups also are provided. Although most PASS programs are not offered for academic credit, they have been developed in coordination with academic depart\u00ad ments. Presented in a coherent, educationally sound manner, these programs are intended to meet the individual needs of all UCI stu\u00ad dents. For example, programs are available to students who desire greater academic proficiency in courses ranging in level from introductory through honors and upper division. Students who desire assistance have the opportunity to find a PASS program that is suited to their needs and that will make their education at UCI more successful and rewarding. Administered through the Division of Undergraduate Education, PASS programs and services are organized under three units: the Learning Skills Center, the Testing, Research, and Evaluation Office, and the Tutorial Assistance Program. All PASS units are located in the Student Services II Building. The Learning SkiiJs Center provides programs designed to help students strengthen and develop their reading, writing, mathemat\u00ad ics, science, analytic thinking, and study skills in order to enrich and enhance their education at UCI. Some Learning Skills pro\u00ad grams are neither discipline- nor course-specific, but stress the development of abilities that-alrstudents need regardless of field or major. Such programs include workshops and individual counsel\u00ad ing in writing, time-management, overcoming procrastination, lis\u00ad tening and note-taking, test-taking, and preparation for the gradu\u00ad ate entrance examinations. Classes in critical reading also are offered. UC IRVINE - 1996-199754 UCI 1996-97 Information for Admitted Students The Center offers a program of course-related adjuncts in conjunc\u00ad tion with designated introductory courses in writing, humanities, chemistry, mathematics, the biological sciences, and the social sci\u00ad ences. These adjuncts, coordinated with regular course instruction, provide an opportunity for students to improve their academic skills in specific courses. The primary responsibility of the Testing, Research, and Evalua\u00ad tion Office is to administer the placement testing program. The office also administers foreign language tests for exemption to the Language Other Than English breadth requirement, and is respon\u00ad sible for the campus-based administration of the Subject A exami\u00ad nation. The research and evaluation component of the office pro\u00ad vides evaluations of programs in PASS and in the Division of Undergraduate Education and conducts research on topics such as student retention, academic needs, course grades, and enrollment patterns. Additional information and testing schedules may be obtained on the World Wide Web at http://www.ugs.uci.edu/-ugs/ plt/, and at http://www.ugs.uci.edu/-ugslfltl. The objective of the Tutorial Assistance Program (TAP) is to aid undergraduate students in comprehending and retaining course-spe\u00ad cific subject matter and in developing the understanding necessary for successful independent learning. Through small-group tutorials, TAP activities are designed to encourage students' confidence and to cultivate, by maximizing their participation, their ability to work with and articulate aspects of the course. Tutoring is available in the following disciplines: the biological sciences, chemistry, com\u00ad puter science, engineering, the humanities, mathematics, physics, social ecology, and the social sciences. TAP also offers a review program for the physical and biological sciences sections of the Medical College Admission Test. The PASS Writing Workshops seek to provide in-depth writing assistance of a focused and methodical nature to students who may find English and Comparative Literature WR39A difficult because of insufficiencies in the University preparation. This assistance, furnished to newly admitted students, addresses specific composi\u00ad tional weaknesses and endeavors to provide students, at an early stage of their course work, with necessary verbal skills. Assistance is given in the form of workshops attached to special sections of English and Comparative Literature WR39A. The Writing Work\u00ad shops enable instructors to give intensive and individualized atten\u00ad tion to students. Student Academic Advancement Services Student Academic Advancement Services (SAAS) provides indi\u00ad vidual counseling and academic support for students who are first\u00ad generation college students or low-income students, as well as dis\u00ad abled students (those with physical and/or learning disabilities). SAAS sponsors several major projects and a variety of workshops. A primary responsibility of SAAS is to monitor the academic progress of its students. To best assist students who are having dif\u00ad ficulty with their course work, professional counselors maintain a close liaison with academic departments. When needed, referrals to other campus support services are provided. In conjunction with these academic and service units, the Engineering and Computer Science Educational Laboratory (ECSEL) program, a gradaute school preparatory course, and a variety of workshops are offered throughout the year by SAAS. SAAS also sponsors and conducts the Summer Bridge Program for underprepared students who demonstrate the potential to succeed at the University. The Program is designed to provide and refine basic academic skills necessary for students to successfully com\u00ad plete their course work during the regular school year. Students are encouraged to make appointments with Student Acad\u00ad emic Advancement Services; telephone (714) 824-6234. Honors Opportunities UCI offers challenging honors opportunities to its most motivated students, including a comprehensive Campuswide Honors Program which is open to outstanding students from all majors from the freshman through senior years, a variety of major-specific honors programs at the upper-division level, the Humanities Honors Pro\u00ad gram, and several Excellence in Research programs. These programs offer some of the advantages usually associated with selective liberal arts colleges: rigorous, small, personalized classes and the intellectual exchange that creates a community of scholars. The difference, however, is that UCI's programs have the support and benefit of the 26-million-volume University of Cali\u00ad fornia Library system (of which UCI Library collections number some 1.5 million volumes) and of the numerous state-of-the-art laboratories on campus. Honors students are encouraged to participate in the Education Abroad Program and/or the International Opportunities Program during their junior or senior year. See the Center for International Education section in this Catalogue for additional information. Campuswide Honors Program The Campuswide Honors Program is available to selected high\u00ad achieving students in all academic majors from their freshman through senior years. During the freshman, sophomore, and junior years, depending upon the individual's course of study, participants enroll in small, honors-level sections of courses and in special hon\u00ad ors courses which satisfy the University's breadth requirements in lower-division writing, humanistic inquiry, natural sciences, and social and behavioral sciences. These honors sequences provide an interdisciplinary approach to major subjects and issues. Faculty from a variety of disciplines are chosen especially for their teach\u00ad ing ability and scholarship. During the junior and senior years, par\u00ad ticipants develop creative projects and conduct original research under the direct supervision of faculty members. In addition to a specific curriculum, other benefits include a variety of student/fac\u00ad ulty social and cultural events, a weekly coffee hour, special study rooms, honors \"academic theme\" group houses on campus, and enhanced advising support. Admission to the Campuswide Honors Program as an incoming freshman to UCI is by invitation only. All eligible candidates who meet minimum criteria are reviewed and selected by faculty repre\u00ad sentatives from each academic unit. Transfer and other students not admitted as incoming freshmen are eligible to apply for admission to the Program up until the first quarter of their junior year, if they have a minimum grade point average of 3.5. Application forms are available in 204 Engineering Tower. Completion of the Campus wide Honors Program is noted on the student's transcript and baccalaureate diploma. Additional informa\u00ad tion is available 824-5461; e-mail: honors@uci.edu. Major-Specific Honors Programs Honors programs for qualified junior-and senior-level students also are available to Drama majors in the School of the Arts; to students from all schools regardless of their majors, by the School of Humanities; to Chemistry and Physics majors in the School of Physical Sciences; to Anthropology, Economics, Linguistics, Politi\u00ad cal Science, Psychology, Social Science, and Sociology majors in the School of Social Sciences; to Information and Computer Sci\u00ad ence majors; and to all majors in the School of Social Ecology. The focal point of each of these programs is the development of analytical and research skills through the pursuit of research under faculty supervision. An honors-level thesis is required in all the programs except Drama. Additional information is available in the specific academic unit sections of this Catalogue. UC IRVINE - 1996-1997Excellence in Research Programs The School of Biological Sciences, the School of Engineering, and the Department of Cognitive Sciences. offer students the opportu\u00ad nity to pursue research through their Excellence in Research Pro\u00ad grams. Students work on their research projects under faculty supervision mid have the opportunity to present their results to peers and faculty and, in certain instances, to have their research papers published. Additional information is available in the spe\u00ad cific academic unit sections of this Catalogue. Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program The Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program (UROP) encourages and supports research and creative activities by UCI undergraduates, under the supervision of faculty members. Every school on campus offers a variety of programs and courses through which undergraduates may be involved in research. For those stu\u00ad dents and faculty who seek assistance from UROP, support can be provided in all phases of research activity: proposal writing, devel\u00ad oping research plans, resource support, conducting research, ana\u00ad lyzing data, and presenting results in oral and written form (such as senior theses presented at the annual Campuswide Undergraduate Research Symposium.) Projects supported by UROP may be done at any time during the academic year and/or summer, and may be conducted in any academic department or interdisciplinary pro\u00ad gram. The research must be worthy of academic credit and must emphasize interaction between the student and the faculty supervisor. UROP coordinates its undergraduate research activities with fac\u00ad ulty in all departments, who provide suggestions about undergradu\u00ad ate research ideas and other faculty contacts. UROP also provides information about opportunities with government laboratories and industrial partners. Additional information is available from the Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program, 204 Engineering Tower; telephone (714) 824-4189; e-mail: urop@uci.edu. Scholarship Opportunities Program High-achieving undergraduate students are encouraged to learn how they can.compete successfully for the most prestigious schol\u00ad arships available for undergraduate and graduate education and to begin learning about the process as early as possible. Opportunities include undergraduate scholarships and research grants, as well as graduate fellowships. The Scholarship Opportunities program, offered through the Campuswide Honors Program, provides infor\u00ad mation, applications, and advice to qualified students; telephone (714) 824-5461. Honors Convocation The UCI Honors Convocation ceremony is held each June for all students who graduate during that academic year with academic honors (summa cum laude, magna cum laude, or cum laude), receive special awards, and get inducted into honor societies. The criteria used by each school in selecting candidates for these hon\u00ad ors are available at the counseling office of each school. One gen\u00ad eral criterion is that students must have completed at least 72 quar\u00ad ter units in residence at a University of California campus. Students who have on file recorded acts of academic dishonesty, as defined in Policies Applying to Campus Activities, Organizations, and Students-Part A, shall be excluded by the Associate Deans from consideration for academic honors at graduation. For further information contact the Division of Undergraduate Education at (714) 824-5428. Phi Beta Kappa Phi Beta Kappa, founded in 1776, maintains a chapter at UCI. Phi Beta Kappa is the nation's oldest and most prestigious honor soci\u00ad ety; it recognizes outstanding scholastic achievement in the liberal arts and sciences .. Upper-division students whose undergraduate records fulfill certain requirements are eligible for election to Division of Undergraduate Education 55 membership. Further information can be obtained from the Divi\u00ad sion of Undergraduate Education, 256 Administration Building. Center for International Education The Center for International Education (CIE) includes the Educa\u00ad tion Abroad Program (EAP) and International Opportunities Pro\u00ad gram (lOP). The Center is a comprehensive resource and counsel\u00ad ing center which helps students take advantage of the many worldwide opportunities that exist for study, work, internship, vol\u00ad unteering, research, and non-credentialed teaching, and prepares students for participation in these programs. Participating in an international educational experience typically introduces students to ways of thinking different from their own, broadens their under\u00ad standing of the historical and contemporary world, sharpens their \u00b7 interest in particular fields, and enhances their overall intellectual development. Professional staff and international peer advisors, who have returned from an lOP or EAP experience, are available to guide students in making appropriate choices of international programs for their educational goals. All EAP and lOP participants are pro\u00ad vided with pre-departure orientations, an EAP or lOP Student Guide handbook, and reentry orientations upon their return to UCI. The Global Issues and International Perspectives class, offered by the School of Social Sciences, introduces prospective EAP and lOP participants to intellectual and adjustment issues that they may face during an extended stay in a foreign country. Students can keep up-to-date on CIE events, deadlines, and new international opportunities by subscribing to the biweekly elec\u00ad tronic newsletter, CIE-NEWS. For information on how to sub\u00ad scribe, contact CIE. CIE, EAP, and lOP are located in 1010 Student Services; telephone (714) 824-6343; e-mail: cie@uci.edu. Additional information is also available on the World Wide Web at http://www.cie.uci. edu/-cie/cie.html. EDUCATION ABROAD PROGRAM The Education Abroad Program (EAP) of the University of Cali\u00ad fornia offers upper-division students the opportunity to experience a different culture while making progress toward degree objectives. EAP is an 6verseas study program which operates in cooperation with about 100 host universities and colleges in about 30 countries throughout the world. One quarter's participation in EAP fulfills the International/Global Issues breadth requirement (category VII\u00ad B). Participation in selected EAP programs also may satisfy the Language Other Than English breadth requirement (category VI); see the Requirements for a Bachelor's Degree section for a list of approved programs. Admission of University of California undergraduate students to the Education Abroad prograJns is subject to the following qualifi\u00ad cations: a minimum 3.0 cumulative grade point average at the time of application and maintained through departure; junior standing by departure (except for specific short-term programs); completion of language courses as required, with an overall minimum grade point average of 3.0 or the equivalent; and the recommendation of the campus EAP Selection Committee. Some programs require prior language study, while others either recommend it or do not require it. Students interested in the language, literature, art, culture, history, government, or social institutions of the countries where EAP study centers are located have the opportunity to gain substantially from first-hand academic experience. Classes in the natural and physical sciences, engineering, and in computer science are avail\u00ad able at selected host institutions. In addition, whatever their field of study, EAP participants can broaden their outlook and gain new skills as the result of study in a foreign country. Study abroad UC IRVINE - 1996-199756 UCI 1996-97 Information for Admitted Students allows students to experience vastly different cultures and contrast\u00ad ing patterns of thinking while making progress toward a UC degree. The cost of studying abroad through EAP is often comparable to the cost of studying at UCI. EAP participants are responsible for the same fees as they pay at UCI, including UC registration and educational fees, campus fees, and room, board, books, and per\u00ad sonal expenses. The only additional costs directly related to the program are for their round-trip transportation and orientation and intensive language program (depending on the Study Center). Most University of California financial aid, including grants, scholar\u00ad ships, and loans, is available to EAP students who qualify. EAP also offers several other scholarships including individual country incentive scholarships awarded to all students studying in these specific programs; EAP Opportunity Grants available to minority and economically disadvantaged students; and the EAP Alumni Scholarship. Contact CIE for additional information. Normally, students participate in EAP during their junior year, so application for EAP usually is made in the sophomore year, how\u00ad ever, students may apply for participation as fourth-or fifth-year seniors. Some programs are also open to sophomores. In addition, students who have completed at least one full year of graduate study and who have support of their academic department and graduate dean may apply. Students interested in EAP should con\u00ad tact CIE early in the fall quarter to obtain an informative brochure, application forms, and information concerning application deadlines. Academic Program. Generally, EAP students attend courses taught by faculty of the host university in the language of the host country. The academic program includes (1) an intensive course in the language of the host country, if applicable (this does not apply to programs in the United Kingdom, Ireland, Australia, New Zealand, or Canada in which English is the language of instruc\u00ad tion), and (2) a full year or, in some cases, a semester of academic courses. Students may go to Denmark, Egypt, Ghana, Hong Kong, Hungary, India, Indonesia, Israel, Korea, the Netherlands, Sweden, or Thailand, with no prior knowledge of these countries' lan\u00ad guages. However, for countries where the language of instruction is not English, students must spend some or all of the summer in intensive language programs which prepare them in the language for the academic year. University of California faculty who serve as directors and associ\u00ad ate directors at most Study Centers provide academic counsel to students while abroad. Full credit is granted for courses satisfacto\u00ad rily completed, and approved courses are recorded on official UC transcripts. With careful planning, most EAP students make normal progress toward their UC degrees. Application of credits earned abroad toward major or graduation requirements is determined by the academic unit in which the participant's major is offered. EAP participants who satisfy all degree requirements while abroad and who expect to graduate upon completion of their term abroad should file for candidacy to receive their degree one to two quar\u00ad ters after completion of EAP because, unfortunately, grades from abroad take time to reach the home campus. Such returnees, how\u00ad ever, may participate in June Commencement. Study Centers. The courses and fields of study open to EAP par\u00ad ticipants vary at each center, and some vary from quarter to quar\u00ad ter. Each of the host universities has special areas of excellence and strength, as described in brochures for each country which are available at CIE. Australia.

Students may choose from academic study (with transferable credit), paid work, paid or unpaid internships, unpaid or compen\u00ad sated volunteer service, field research, and paid teaching opporuni\u00ad ties in nearly every country in the world. This includes all acade\u00ad mic programs sponsored by U.S. institutions that occur on foreign soil or water (as in the case of the Semester at Sea program), direct enrollment at foreign institutions, summer session abroad programs through UCI and other UC campuses, and UCI Independent Study (199) done in foreign countries under the supervision of a UCI fac\u00ad ulty member. With careful planning lOP students participating in study programs may be able to make progress toward their UCI degree by fulfilling major, minor, or breadth requirements. \u00b7 lOP participants who have had their study program (and transfer\u00ad able credit) preapproved through completion of the International Study Advance Contract are eligible to apply for UCI financial aid. Many scholarships are also available. Any UCI student (undergrad\u00ad uate, graduating senior, or graduate) in good academic standing, regardless of major, class level, or foreign language ability, may participate in lOP. To acquaint students with opportunities abroad, lOP sponsors the yearly \"Go Abroad Fair\" and periodic presentations, orientations, and workshops. It also maintains a library of international resources and publications listing opportunities abroad. REQUIREMENTS FOR A BACHELOR'S DEGREE There are four groups of requirements that must be met to earn a baccalaureate degree from UCI. They are general University of California requirements, UCI requirements, school or program requirements, and degree-specific requirements. General Univer\u00ad sity and UCI requirements are described in detail below. School or program and major-specific requirements are described in full in the academic unit sections. Students with identified learning and/or physical disabilities, including language-acquisition problems, are eligible to receive support through the Office for Disability Services; telephone (714) 824-7494 (voice), 824-6272 (TDD). Staff can assist students from the time they are admitted to UCI until they graduate. Catalogue Rights Students enrolled at UCI from their freshman year may elect to meet as graduation requirements (UC, UCI, school, and major): (a) those in effect at the time of entrance; or (b) those subsequently established after entrance. A readmitted student who has not been enrolled at UCI for three or more consecutive quarters (excluding summer sessions) must adhere to the graduation requirements: (a) in effect for the quarter in which the student is readmitted; or (b) those subsequently established. Students transferring from other collegiate institutions may elect to meet as graduation requirements either: (a) those in effect at the time of enrollment at UCI; (b) those subsequently established; or (c) those in effect at UCI when the student first entered a previous, accredited collegiate institution, provided that the student has been Requirements for a Bachelor's Degree 57 continuously enrolled in a collegiate institution and that entry was not more than four years prior to the time of enrollment at UCI. A transfer student who has had a break of enrollment of two con\u00ad secutive semesters or three consecutive quarters (excluding sum\u00ad mer sessions) may follow the requirements in effect at UCI: (a) at the time of enrollment at UCI; (b) those subsequently established; or (c) those in effect at the time of reentry into a previous, accred\u00ad ited collegiate institution, provided that reentry was not more than four years prior to enrollment at UCI. A transfer student who has been continuously enrolled in college for more than four years prior to transfer may use: (a) the require\u00ad ments in effect at the time of enrollment at UCI; (b) those subse\u00ad quently established; or (c) those in effect at UCI four years prior to enrollment at uc;::I. Transfer students who complete one of the following options will be considered to have met the total UCI breadth requirement except the upper-division writing requirement: (a) students who transfer from a four-year institution and who have completed the general education requirements of that college, upon approval of petition; (b) students who transfer from another UC campus and have met the general education requirements of that campus (may be completed at UCI if in progress at the time of transfer); or (c) transfer students who have completed the Intersegmental General Education Transfer Curriculum prior to transfer. University Requirements ENGLISH (\"SUBJECT A\") Every undergraduate must demonstrate upon entrance to the Uni\u00ad versity an acceptable level of ability in English composition. This requirement may be met before entrance by: 1. Achieving a grade 3, 4, or 5 in either of the two College Board Advanced Placement Examinations in English; or 2. Achieving a score of 660 or better on the SAT II Writing Test (600 if taken prior to May 1995); or 3. Achieving a score of 5 or above on the International Baccalaure\u00ad ate's Higher Level English A Examination; or 4. Entering the University with credentials from another college which show the completion of an acceptable one-quarter (four units) or one-semester (three units) course in English composi\u00ad tion with a letter grade of C or better; or 5. Achieving a score of 8 or higher on the University of California writing proficiency examination (Subject A Examination); or 6. Completing the California State University English Equivalency Test with \"Pass for two full courses of College English Credit\" (this test was discontinued in 1993). Those students who have not met the Subject A requirement before entrance must satisfy the requirement before the begin\u00ad ning of their fourth quarter at UCI. Students who have not sat~ isfied the requirement by that time will be ineligible to enroll for a fourth quarter. Students enrolled in Humanities 20A-B-C-D (Writing for Stu\u00ad dents for Whom English is a Second Language) must enroll in a Subject A course (English and Comparative Literature WR 37, WR 39A, or Humanities lAS/A) immediately after they are authorized to do so. The Subject A requirement may be met after admission by one of the following three options: 1. Passing the Universitywide Subject A Examination given in mid-May (and on subsequent dates) to all entering freshmen admitted for fall quarter, 1996 (see Placement Testing). Transfer students who have not satisfied the Subject A requirement UC IRVINE - 1996-199758 UCI 1996-97 Information for Admitted Students should contact the UCI Composition Program Office (220 Humanities Office Building) for evaluation; telephone (714) 824-6717. 2. Enrolling in sections of the Humanities Core Course designated \"S/A.\" (NOTE: Students held for Subject A and enrolled in the Humanities Core must enroll in a S/ A section of the Core Course during their first quarter. Successful completion of the writing component of these sections of this course with a Jetter grade of C or better will satisfy the Subject A requirement. Stu\u00ad dents who do not receive a Jetter grade of C or better in Human\u00ad ities lAS/A in fall quarter and who continue to be held for Sub\u00ad ject A must enroll in Humanities lB S/A during the winter quarter and satisfy the requirement by earning a Jetter grade of Cor better.) 3. Taking English and Comparative Literature WR 37 or WR 39A and receiving a Jetter grade of at least a C in that course. The Pass/Not Pass grade option may not be used to satisfy the Subject A requirement. Students enrolled at UCI may take only UCI courses in satisfaction of the Subject A requirement. Continuing UCI students may not take sum1per courses at another institution to satisfy the Subject A requirement. AMERICAN HISTORY AND INSTITUTIONS This requirement may be met by one of the following options: 1. Completion in high school of one year of United States history with grades of C or better, or one semester of United States his\u00ad tory and one semester of United States government with grades of C or better. 2. Achieving a score of 3, 4, or 5 on the College Board Advanced Placement Examination in United States History. 3. Achieving a score of 550 or better on the SAT II: American His\u00ad tory and Social Studies test (500 or better on tests taken prior to May 1995). 4. Presentation of a certificate of completion of the requirement at another California institution. 5. Completion at another institution of one year of college-level United States history with grades of C or better, or one course in United States history and one in United States government with grades of C or better. 6. Completion at UCi, with a grade of C or better, of one course selected from History 10, 40A, 40B, or 40C and either Political Science 21A or 53A. UCI Requirements UNIT REQUIREMENT Credit for a minimum of 180 quarter units, earned by examination, by other evaluation, or course work is required. A course normally offers four quarter units of credit. GRADE REQUIREMENT A minimum grade average of at least C (2.0) is required (1) over\u00ad all, (2) in all of the courses required for the major program, and (3) in the upper-division courses required for the major program. Higher averages than this may be required only in honors pro\u00ad grams. Students who fail to attain a C (2.0) average in courses required in the major program may, at the option of the major unit, be denied the privilege of pursuing a major program in that unit. (In this context, \"the courses required in the major program\" are defined as the courses required for the major and offered by the program of the student's major.) RESIDENCE REQUIREMENT Credit for the last 36 units of work immediately preceding gradua\u00ad tion must be earned in residence at the UCI campus. Exceptions to this rule may be allowed, with prior departmental approval, to stu\u00ad dents enrolled in the Education Abroad Program. BREADTH REQUIREMENT Among the many possible purposes for breadth requirements, the one that stands out at UCI is that of introducing students to the basic modes of thought that characterize academic disciplines. In order to know ourselves and the world, we need to know first the ways these can and have been known. Thus the breadth require\u00ad ment at UCI requires students to devote a substantial amount of their course work, especially in their first years, to connected series of courses which provide a coherent experience within such areas as the natural and social sciences, humanistic inquiry and the arts, and the nature of symbolic systems. Several other aims that UCI regards as especially desirable are consistent with this chief purpose and are embodied to varying degrees in the UCI breadth requirement: to cultivate a historical consciousness of society and culture; to acquaint students with fun\u00ad damental ways of thinking different from their own or that of their gender, class, and culture with a view to expanding their sense of human possibilities and awakening an awareness of the condi\u00ad tioned nature of their own assumptions about the world; to equip students with a broad understanding of the contemporary world and its cultural, political, scientific, and technological problems; to equip students with the skills essential to understanding and grap\u00ad pling with these problems; to establish bridges and to understand relationships between academic disciplines; and to provide stu\u00ad dents with some intellectual experiences which virtually all can be assumed to have had in common and thus to introduce them to what, after all, a university has traditionally been supposed first and foremost to be, an intellectual community. The breadth requirement is a graduation requirement and, with the exception of the lower-division writing requirement, need not be satisfied during only the lower-division years. To satisfy the breadth requirement, courses are required in each of the following categories: I. Writing II. Natural Sciences III. Social and Behavioral Sciences IV. Humanistic Inquiry V. Mathematics and Symbolic Systems VI. Language Other Than English VII. Multicultural Studies and InternationaVGlobal Issues The specific course combinations and sequences in each area which may be used by students to satisfy the requirement are listed below. A number of the courses listed are available in more than one academic unit. When a breadth course is cross-listed with another course, that course also is available for fulfillment of the breadth requirement. Students should refer to the actual descrip\u00ad tions of the courses to determine which are cross-listed. These course combinations were selected to ensure that students, in meeting the requirement, be expo~ed to subject matter, problems, and techniques which would serve as a first introduction to an aca\u00ad demic area, as well as to a connected set of courses which provide a coherent experience in that academic area. UC IRVINE - 1996-1997With the exception of categories I and VII, a student may count toward breadth no more than a year of work taken within the disci\u00ad pline of the major. For example, a student majoring in Philosophy may count no more than three quarter courses in philosophy toward breadth categories II, III, IV, V, or VI. Students fulfill the UCI breadth requirement by completing courses from the list which follows. Students can select from among a vari\u00ad ety of courses, depending upon their area of interest. Some of the course combinations available consist of multiple-quarter courses (such as Chemistry lA-B-C under the Chemistry subsection of \"category II. Natural Sciences\"). Multiple-quarter courses are referred to as being \"sequential,\" meaning that the course work in the earlier courses is prerequisite to the later course work. Students must take each part of a sequential course in alphabetical order (e.g., students must take Chemistry lA before either 1B or lC). Sequential courses are separated by hyphens. Other course combi\u00ad nations consist of single-quarter courses (e.g., Anthropology 2A, 2B, 2C under the Anthropology subsection of \"category III. Social and Behavioral Sciences\") which are related to one another but for which no course in the combination is preparatory to any other course in the combination. Single-quarter course combinations may be taken in any order. Single-quarter courses are separated by com\u00ad mas. Semicolons separate complete course combinations. BREADTH CATEGORIES I. Writing Requirement. Because of the importance of writing in every academic discipline, the University is committed to develop\u00ad ing the writing skills of its students at all levels and in all areas. The Writing Requirement expresses this commitment, but the con\u00ad cern for and attention to clear, accurate writing is expected in all courses. The Writing Requirement consists of three courses beyond the Subject A Requirement. Except where otherwise noted below, stu\u00ad dents must satisfy the Subject A Requirement prior to fulfilling the Writing Requirement. Two of the three courses required must be lower-division courses and normally must be completed prior to the junior year (or in the case of transfer students within the first year of residency). The third course must be an upper-division course, and it must be taken only after the successful completion of 90 quarter units (achieve\u00ad ment of junior status) and completion of the lower-division requirement. Students enrolled at UCI may take only UCI courses in satisfaction of the of the lower-division and upper-division writing require\u00ad ments. Continuing UCI students may not take summer courses at another institution to satisfy lower-division or upper-division writ\u00ad ing requirements. Lower-Division Requirement: The two courses taken to fulfill the lower-division requirement must be completed with a minimum grade of C (or a Pass or Credit grade equivalent to C). Students may select from the courses specified below: 1. English and Comparative Literature WR 39B (Expository Writ\u00ad ing) and WR 39C (Argument and Research). 2. English and Comparative Literature WR 37 (Intensive Writing) and WR 39C (Argument and Research). Recommended students only. 3. Two quarters of the writing component of the Humanities Core Course (Humanities lA-B-C) beyond satisfaction of the Subject A requirement. NOTE: Students held for Subject A and enrolled in the Humanities Core must enroll in a section of the Core Course designated S/A during their first quarter. Successful completion of the writing component of these sections of this course with a letter grade of C or better will satisfy the Subject A requirement. (The Pass/Not Pass grade option may not be Requirements for a Bachelor's Degree 59 used to satisfy Subject A.) For these students, the lower-division writing requirement may be satisfied only in the second and third quarters of the Humanities Core Course. Students who do not receive a Cor better in Humanities lAS/A in fall quarter and continue to be held for Subject A must enroll in Humanities lB S/A during the winter quarter and satisfy the requirement by earning a letter grade of C or better. The lower-division writing requirement will be satisfied in the second and third quarters of the Humanities Core Course for these students. 4. Students who complete English and Comparative Literature WR 37 or WR 39B with a grade of B (3.0) or better may substitute as the second course of the lower-division Writing Requirement one of the following courses in creative writing or nonfiction and journalism: English and Comparative Literature WR 30, WR 31, WR 32, orWR 38. Upper-Division Requirement: The course taken to fulfill the upper-division requirement must be completed with a minimum grade of C (or a Pass or Credit grade equivalent to C). The require\u00ad ment may be satisfied by completing any one of the following: 1. English and Comparative Literature WR139W. 2. An approved upper-division course in nonfiction and journalism or creative writing. Such courses frequently have special prereq\u00ad uisites. Students may not use such a course to satisfy the requirement unless they have attained a B or better in both courses taken to satisfy the lower-division Writing Requirement. 3. An upper-division course designated on a list of approved courses in the quarterly Schedule of Classes as approved for sat\u00ad isfaction of the requirement. NOTE: All courses approved to fulfill the upper-division writing requirement should have a \"W\" suffix. Students are encouraged to consult the Schedule of Classes or their advisor to determine the current upper-division writing requirement course offerings. If a course on the approved list is offered without the \"W\" suffix, it does not sat\u00ad isfy the upper-division writing requirement. 4. By examination (refer to the quarterly Schedule of Classes). Juniors and seniors will be exempted from the upper-division course requirement if they successfully complete the Upper\u00ad Division Exemption Examination in English Composition. This examination may be taken only once. Students who fail to attain the required grades in the courses taken in fulfillment of the Writing Requirement should refer to the Acad\u00ad emic Regulations and Procedures section for further information.

(Consult the Center for Inter\u00ad national Education for other EAP courses of study which also may fulfill this requirement). F. The equivalent as determined by an appropriate and available means of evaluation. For information on availability of such examinations and testing schedules, consult the Testing, Research, and Evaluation Office, Student Services II, (714) 824-6207. If an appropriate means of evaluating competence in a non-English language of instruction does not exist, satisfactory completion, with a C average or better, of two years of formal schooling at the sixth grade level or higher in an institution where the language of instruction is not English will meet the requirement. Appropriate documentation must be presented to substantiate that the course work was completed. UC IRVINE - 1996-1997VII. Multicultural Studies and lnternationaVGiobal Issues. Students must select one course in multicultural studies and one course on intemationaVglobal issues from the following lists. In fulfilling category VII, students may use courses which are also being used in fulfillment of other breadth categories. For example, Anthropology 2A simultaneously satisfies category Vli-B and a portion of category III. In addition, VII-B may be fulfilled by one quarter's participation in the Education Abroad Program (EAP). Multicultural Studies (VII-A): Anthropology S5A, 125X, 136K, 13SR, 161T Classics 175 Education 124, 171 English and Comparative Literature CL 9, CL 105, E 105 Environmental Analysis 161 Women's Studies 50A, SOB, SOC, 51, 150, 160, 161, 40B, 40C East Asian Languages and Literatures 3A-B-C, 55, llO, l17, 120, 130, 150, 155, 160, ISO, 190 Economics 14SD, 152A, 152P-Q English and Comparative Literature CL 40C Environmental Analysis and Film Studies 160 French lOlA-B-C, llO, l15, l16, 117, 11S, l19, 120, 125, 127, 139, 150, 160 German 50, IOOA-B-C, 101, 102A, 102B, ll7, llS, SA, 5B, 30 Italian lOOA-B, lOlA, lOlB, lOlC, 160 Japanese 3A-B-C, lOOA-B, lOlA-B-C, 115, 150, 151, 152 Requirements for a Bachelor's Major Requirements In addition to the University and UCI requirements listed above, each undergraduate student must satisfy the degree requirements for the major and, if applicable, the minor or concentration selected. UCI, school, and departmental or major and minor requirements may overlap; courses taken to fulfill a school or departmental requirement (e.g., the physics course requirement in the School of Biological Sciences) may also help fulfill the UCI breadth requirement. Students are urged to make sure that they understand how many courses are permitted to satisfy more than one requirement. Information on specific degree requirements and courses is available in the a~ademic unit sections of this Catalogue. Students should have declared a major no later than the beginning of their junior year, having made certain that the background and the preparation prerequisite to junior and senior work in the major have been accomplished. Transfer students should read the section on Information for Transfer Students: Fulfilling Requirements for a Bachelor's Degree. Students should note that with the exception of courses designated Pass/Not Pass Only, courses taken Pass/Not Pass may not be used to satisfy specific course requirements of the student's school and major, unless authorized by the appropriate dean. Additional infor\u00ad mation on grading is located in the Academic Regulations and Procedures section. Minor Programs For certification in a minor, a student must obtain a minimum overall grade point average of at least C (2.0) in all courses required for the minor program. No more than two courses applied to a minor may be taken Pass/Not Pass. Completion of the minor is noted on a student's transcript. Students are not required to minor in a program in order to gradu\u00ad ate from UCI. Application for Graduation In order to receive a degree, an undergraduate student should file an Application for Graduation at the appropriate dean's office, preferably during the first quarter of the senior year, but no less than six months before the expected day of graduation. Specific deadline dates for filing an Application for Graduation are estab\u00ad lished quarterly by each academic unit so that candidates' acade\u00ad mic records can be reviewed to verify that all graduation require\u00ad ments have been met. These dates vary among academic units. Students should contact their academic counselors for deadline dates. UC IRVINE - 1996-199762 UCI 1996-97 Information for Admitted Students INFORMATION FOR TRANSFER STUDENTS: FULFILLING REQUIREMENTS FOR A BACHELOR'S DEGREE This section provides a guide for transfer students in understanding how their course work from another collegiate institution applies to fulfilling UCI degree requirements. Transfer students should use this information in conjunction with the previous section, Require\u00ad ments for a Bachelor's Degree. Transfer students are required to meet university, breadth, school, department, and major require\u00ad ments described in the Catalogue. The courses and descriptions in this Catalogue may be used by prospective transfer students as a guide for selecting courses of similar content and purpose in their own institutions. No student who has taken a course which is accepted for credit by the Office of Admissions and Relations with Schools and which has been mutually determined with a commu\u00ad nity college as being acceptable toward completion of the UCI breadth requirement shall incur any loss of credit in satisfaction of the requirement. Transfer students are strongly advised to check with the academic counselor in their prospective major or the Office of Admissions and Relations with Schools about courses that may be used to sat\u00ad isfy UCI requirements. Transfer Students: Completion of the UCI Breadth Requirement Students transferring to UCI must satisfy the UCI breadth require\u00ad ment by completing either: (a) the current UCI breadth require\u00ad ment, (b) one of the options listed in the Catalogue Rights section on page 57, or (c) the Intersegmental General Education Transfer Curriculum. With the exception of students who complete the Intersegmental General Education Transfer Curriculum, transfer students should not feel that the breadth requirement must be completed prior to matriculating to UCI. The breadth requirement, which must be completed prior to graduation, may be satisfied by college-level courses appropriate to UCI offerings and may be met at any time during the undergraduate years, except in the case of the lower\u00ad division writing requirement, which must be completed in the first year of residency at UCI. BREADTH CATEGORIES I. Writing. The lower-division writing requirement is met by tak\u00ad ing an approved one-year sequence in English composition. Courses used to meet the lower-division writing requirement must be completed with a minimum grade of C (or a Pass or Credit grade equivalent to C). Transfer students may not count any course designed exclusively for the satisfaction of Subject A toward the completion of the lower-division writing requirement. Any student entering UCI with only one semester or one quarter of English composition through which the Subject A requirement is fulfilled will not have satisfied any part of the writing requirement. Stu\u00ad dents enrolled at UCI may take only UCI courses in satisfaction of the lower-division and upper-division writing requirements. Con\u00ad tinuing UCI students may not take summer courses at another institution to satisfy lower-division or upper-division writing requirements. II. Natural Sciences. This requirement is met by (a) taking an approved one-year sequence in one of the following areas: general biology, general chemistry, basic physics; or by (b) taking two semesters or three quarters of approved courses in biological sci\u00ad ences or physical sciences with the exception of mathematics. These courses may or may not include a laboratory. III. Social and Behavioral Sciences. This requirement is met by taking a year of approved work in any of the following areas: anthropology, comparative culture, economics, geography, linguis\u00ad tics, political science, psychology, sociology, or social ecology. Students on the semester system may elect to take an introductory course followed by a second course in the same area or an intro\u00ad ductory course from each of any two areas. Students on the quarter system may elect to take an introductory course followed by two courses in one area, or an introductory course followed by a sec\u00ad ond course in the same area plus an introductory course from - another area. (History, for the purposes of the breadth requirement, is not considered a social or behavioral science but rather an area of humanistic inquiry.) IV. Humanistic Inquiry. This requirement is met by taking two semesters or three quarters of approved courses in one of the fol\u00ad lowing areas: classics, history, philosophy, humanities, English lit\u00ad erature, comparative literature, women's studies, dramatic litera\u00ad ture, or the history of art, dance, or music. Performance courses may not be used in satisfaction of this requirement. V. Mathematics and Symbolic Systems. This requirement is met by taking two semesters or three quarters of approved courses in mathematics, computer science, linguistics, or logic. VI. Language Other Than English. This requirement is met by (a) completing the third semester or fourth quarter of approved col\u00ad lege-level study in a language other than English; (b) credit for four years of high school study, or its equivalent, in a single lan\u00ad guage other than English with a C average or better in the fourth year; (c) a score of 4 or 5 on a College Board Advanced Placement Examination in a language other than English; (d) a score of 620 or better on a SAT II examination in a language other than English, with the exception of SAT II: Modem Hebrew for which a score of 540 or better is required (a score of 600 or better is required for all tests taken prior to May 1995); (e) completion of an approved course of study in an Education Abroad Program; or (f) the equiva\u00ad lent as determined by an appropriate and available means of evalu\u00ad ation. If an appropriate means of evaluating competence in a non\u00ad English language of instruction does not exist, satisfactory completion, with a C average or better, of two years of formal schooling at the sixth grade level or higher in an institution where the language of instruction is not English will meet the require\u00ad ment. Appropriate documentation must be presented to substantiate that the course work was completed. VII. Multicultural Studies and International/Global Issues. This requirement is met by completing: one course in multicultural studies and one course on international/global issues. One quarter's participation in the Education Abroad Program (EAP) also satisfies the international/global issues portion of the requirement. Courses satisfying the multicultural requirement specifically address the history, society, and/or culture of one or more minority groups in California and the United States. Courses satisfying the interna\u00ad tional/global requirement focus on significant cultural, economic, geographical, historical, political, and/or sociological aspects of one or more foreign countries. INTERSEGMENTAL GENERAL EDUCATION TRANSFER CURRICULUM California community college transfer students may fulfill the UCI breadth requirement by completing the Intersegmental General Education Transfer Curriculum (IGETC). The IGETC consists of a series of subject areas and types of courses which, if completed prior to transfer, will satisfy the breadth and general education requirements at any campus of the University of California. Fulfill\u00ad ment of the IGETC does not satisfy the UCI upper-division writing requirement. Students who do not complete the IGETC prior to transferring to UCI must fulfill the UCI breadth requirement in its entirety. UC IRVINE - 1996-1997Courses used to fulfill the IGETC must be completed with a grade of C or better. (Courses may also be taken on a Pass/No Pass basis provided Pass is equal to a letter grade of C or better.) Lists of specific approved courses which may be taken in ful\u00ad fillment of the IGETC are available from California community colleges. Intersegmental General Education Transfer Curriculum 1. Language Other Than English: Proficiency equivalent to two years of high school study in the same language. 2. English Communication: One course in English Composition and a second course in Critical Thinking-English Composition. 3. Mathematical Concepts and Quantitative Reasoning: One course in mathematics or mathematical statistics which has a prerequisite of intermediate algebra. Courses on the application of statistics to particular disciplines are not acceptable. 4. Arts and Humanities: Three courses, at least one in arts and one in humanities. 5. Social and Behavioral Sciences: Three courses in at least two different disciplines. 6. Physical and Biological Sciences: One physical science and one biological science course; one must include a laboratory. Transferability of Credit The University is committed to serve as fully as possible the edu\u00ad cational needs of students who transfer from other California colle\u00ad giate institutions. The principles covering transferability of unit credit and course credit are explained below and, unless otherwise indicated, are much the same whether transfer is from a two-year or a four-year institution. UNIT CREDIT FOR WORK TAKEN ELSEWHERE The University of California grants unit credit for courses com\u00ad pleted at other accredited colleges and universities when such courses are consistent with the functions of the University as set forth in the Master Plan for Higher Education in California. Equiv\u00ad alent advanced standing credit from institutions on the semester calendar may be determined at a ratio of one semester unit to one and one-half quarter units. (To graduate from UCI a minimum of 180 quarter units, equivalent to 45 UCI quarter courses, are needed.) Community Colleges A student may earn a maximum of 105 quarter units (70 semester units) at a community college toward a University degree. No fur\u00ad ther unit credit may be transferred from a community college, although subject, major, or breadth credit for courses taken will still be granted. Students anticipating transfer to UCI are urged to consult with their community college counselors. The counselors, with the aid of that college's UC transfer course list, can advise students about California community college courses and units which will transfer to the University. In addition, staff in the UCI Office of Admis\u00ad sions and Relations with Schools keep current copies of the lists and can advise students about the transferability of courses. Four-Year Institutions Unit credit is granted for courses consistent with the University of California's functions and which have been completed in colleges or universities accredited by the appropriate agencies. While limi\u00ad tations of credit may be imposed in certain subject areas, these are consonant with the curricula for all students in the University of California. No defined maximum number of units which can be earned toward the degree is set for students transferring from four-Transfer Students: Fulfilling Degree Requirements 63 year institutions. However, see the Residence Requirement in the UCI Requirements section. University of California Extension Extension courses prefixed by XB, XD, XI, XR, XSB, and XSD are granted unit credit on the same basis as courses taken in resi\u00ad dence at any accredited collegiate institution. Students intending to transfer Extension course credit for a degree at another college or university should verify acceptance of the course with that institution. Resident students of the University of California must obtain the consent of the dean of their school or college prior to enrolling for credit in an Extension course. Exten\u00ad sion courses are not accepted as part of the residence requirements of the University. Grades earned in University Extension are not used in calculating the University grade point average. Decisions regarding the acceptability of extension courses taken in institutions other than the University of California rest with the Office of Admissions and Relations with Schools. Decisions regarding the applicability of such courses toward specific degrees and majors rest with the student's academic dean. COURSE CREDIT FOR WORK TAKEN ELSEWHERE The policies above refer only to the unit transferability of courses and are uniformly implemented on all campuses of the University. Thus, courses which are determined by the University of California to be transferable are assured only of being granted elective course credit. The application of transfer work to specific course and major requirements is determined by the student's academic dean. The Irvine campus makes every effort to eliminate all barriers to orderly progress from California community colleges into UCI's programs. To this end, courses from many California community colleges have been reviewed by UCI faculty and approved as acceptable toward meeting lower-division major or breadth requirements. Although course equivalencies for the breadth requirement may be liberally interpreted for purposes of transfer, courses to be applied toward school and departmental major requirements must be more precisely equated with UCI courses in unit value and in content. Many California community colleges have entered into articulation agreements with UCI so that the specific application of their courses to UCI's breadth, school, and departmental major require\u00ad ments may be readily communicated to prospective transfer stu\u00ad dents. By careful selection of courses, it is possible for students to satisfy some or all of the lower-division requirements of their intended program or school prior to transfer. It is recommended that transfer students complete as much of the lower-division breadth, school, and major requirements as possible prior to trans\u00ad ferring to UCI. Students are urged to consult community college counselors or the Office of Admissions and Relations with Schools for information on planning a program for transfer. Prospective transfer students with specific questions about course work in their major should contact the respective school or department at UCI. UC IRVINE - 1996-199764 UCI 1996-97 Information for Admitted Students A selection of campus events includes sports club exhibitions, multicultural cele\u00ad brations, intercollegiate athletic competitions, career fairs, and student club and organization information sessions. UC IRVINE - 1996-1997ENROLLMENT AND OTHER PROCEDURES Except where noted, all information applies to both undergraduate and graduate students. Additional information concerning enroll\u00ad ment and academic policies applying only to graduate students is given in the Graduate Studies and Research section. Enrollment and Payment of Fees To receive academic credit for regular courses and other supervised instruction or research, a student must be officially enrolled prior to undertaking such activities. Registration does not become offi\u00ad cial until all required fees have been paid, and the student enrolls in classes with the Registrar. Students are responsible for ensuring that their course enrollments are correct. A quarterly calendar of dates for enrollment and payment of fees is included in each quarterly Schedule of Classes. The Schedule of Classes booklet is distributed to continuing students during the seventh week of each quarter for the ensuing quarter and also may be purchased at the UCI Bookstore. New students receive the booklet by mail. The general procedures for enrollment are: I. Consult the appropriate academic advisor to develop an approved program of study. Secure necessary authorizations for courses that require special approval. New undergraduate students entering in the fall should seriously consider attending one of the Student-Parent Orientation Pro\u00ad gram (SPOP) sessions during the summer for academic advising and enrollment assistance. 2. Pay careful attention to deadlines. Enroll in classes during the published registration period. 3. Pay required fees to the Cashier. Any other outstanding obliga\u00ad tions must be satisfied at this time also. NOTE: Late fee payment and/or late enrollment in classes may re\u00ad quire the student to enroll in classes using the Add-card procedure. TELEPHONE REGISTRATION TELE, UCI's telephone registration system, allows students to enroll in classes from anywhere in the world. Students may add and drop classes, inquire about open sections, change their grading option or units for a variable-unit class, and list their confirmed class schedule. Immediate feedback on the availability of a class and a student's eligibility to enroll is provided; schedule changes may be made during the registration period or the adjustment period. Complete information about TELE is available in each quarterly Schedule of Classes. PAYMENT OF FEES AND ENROLLMENT Registration fees are assessed quarterly and appear on the ZOT\u00ad Bills mailed to students by the Campus Billing Services Office. Students who do not pay all required fees to the Cashier's Office during the published registration period are subject to a late service fee. This fee is graduated: $25 through the end of the second week of classes; $50 thereafter. Students who do not enroll in classes during the published registra\u00ad tion period are subject to a late service fee. Between the deadline and the end of the second week of classes, the late service fee is $25 for undergraduate students. Thereafter it increases to $50. The fee is $50 for graduate students after the second week of classes. A signature of the student's dean is required for late enrollment once the quarter begins. The student is subject to both late service fees (either $50 or $100) if fees are not paid to the Cashier's Office and the student does not Enrollment and Other Procedures 65 enroll in classes by the registration deadlines, which are published quarterly in the Schedule of Classes. To avoid the expense and inconvenience of late enrollment, stu\u00ad dents are urged to enroll and pay fees well before the published registration deadlines. Students with financial need should make advance arrangements with the Financial Aid Office, or another source, to have funds available when fees are due. Late registration (payment of fees and/or enrollment in classes) is permitted only in exceptional circumstances with the authorization of the student's dean. A student who is allowed to apply late and, as a result, must pay fees and enroll late, is required to pay late service fees. Late services charges may be waived only if the Uni\u00ad versity is responsible for the late transaction. CHANGE OF CLASS ENROLLMENT After officially enrolling in classes with the Registrar, a student may add or drop courses, change sections of a course, or change the grading option by completing an Add, Drop, or Change of Grading Option Card, available from the student's academic coun\u00ad seling office or the Registrar's Office. These cards must be processed in person at the Registrar's Office. During the first two weeks of instruction, some professors permit add/drop transactions using TELE. There is a $3 service charge for all add, drop, or change transactions received at the Registrar's Office after the sec\u00ad ond week of classes. An undergraduate student may not enroll in more than 20 units or fewer than 12 units of course work during a given quarter without the permission of the student's academic dean or, for undecided/ undeclared students, the Dean of the Division of Undergraduate Education. Changes to Pass/Not Pass grading must not cause the student to exceed the limitations to Pass/Not Pass enrollment. Graduate students may not enroll in more than 16 or fewer than eight units of graduate or upper-division credit without prior approval of the departmental Graduate Advisor and the Dean of Graduate Studies. During the first six weeks of each quarter, a student may add classes provided approval to add each class is granted by the instructor in charge. To add a class, a student must obtain the instructor's signature of approval on an Add card, pay the service charge (if applicable), properly complete the Add card, and submit the card to the Registrar's Office no later than the end of the sixth week of instruction. The dated signature of the instructor is always required and is valid for I 0 working days. To drop a class or change the grading option during the first two weeks of the quarter, a student must obtain the signature of the instructor in charge as evidence of notification on a Drop or Change of Grading Option Card and submit the card to the Reg\u00ad istrar's Office no later than the end of the second week of instruction. Students may drop classes from the third through the sixth week of a quarter, inclusive, only with the permission of the instructor in charge. A student wishing to drop a class during this period must obtain the signature of approval from the instructor in charge on a Drop card, pay $3 at the Cashier's Office, and submit the card to the Registrar's Office. After the sixth week of a quarter, students may drop a course only with the permission of the instructor and the student's academic dean. Permission to drop after the sixth week can be granted only if the student is not failing the course and not subject to disqualifi\u00ad cation, and only if dropping the course would be to the educational benefit of the student, of the class as a whole, or both. To drop a class after the sixth week, a student must complete a Drop card, obtain the instructor's and the dean's signatures of approval, pay UC IRVINE - 1996-199766 UCI 1996-97 Information for Admitted Students $3 at the Cashier's Office, and submit the card to the Registrar's Office. Graduate students must have the approval of the Dean of Graduate Studies to drop a course after the sixth week. A W notation will be recorded for each course dropped after the end of the sixth week of classes. The effective date of a \"drop\" is the date the approved Drop card is received in the Registrar's Office. Every student enrolled in a laboratory course in which equipment is issued is responsible for the equipment when dropping a course and will not be permitted to drop until the equipment is accounted for. Students are responsible for their official enrollment and must be officially enrolled in each class they attend. They must officially drop classes they have ceased attending. The student cannot simply discontinue attendance in a class; a Drop card must be filed before the last day of instruction for the quarter. Students are urged to ver\u00ad ify their official enrollment early in the quarter by inquiring at the Registrar's Office. The Registrar's Office cannot accept Add, Drop, or Change cards after the last day of instruction of a particular quarter. NOTE: Instructors and deans may have earlier deadlines than those mentioned above. Part-Tirrie Status UCI offers several possibilities to pursue part-time study for credit leading to an undergraduate or graduate degree. Part-time study opportunities are available in academic units in which there exists good educational reason, as determined by the academic unit, to allow part-time study. To take advantage of reduced fees for part\u00ad time status, quarterly course enrollment is limited to 10 units or less for undergraduate students and to eight units or less for gradu\u00ad ate students. Students enrolled in excess units after the Friday of the third week of instruction are liable for full fees. The same admissions standards that apply to full-time students apply to part-time students. Under University policy, academic deans (the Dean of the Division of Undergraduate Education, for undecided/undeclared students; the Dean of Graduate Studies, for graduate students) may approve Petitions for Part-Time Status only for reasons of occupation, family responsibilities, or health. In addition to all other required fees, students approved for part\u00ad time status pay one-half of the Educational Fee and one-half of the Nonresident Tuition Fee, Professional School Student Fee, or Duplicate Degree Fee (if applicable). Undergraduate petitions are available from academic counselors or the Registrar's Office; grad\u00ad uate students may obtain further information and petitions from the Office of Research and Graduate Studies. Since there are certain restrictions on receiving undergraduate credit for part-time course work, undergraduates interested in part-time study should read, in addition to the Undergraduate Admissions section, the sections on Expenses and Fees, and Financial Aid. Graduate students should refer to the Research and Graduate Studies section. Additional information is available in the quarterly Schedule of Classes. Lapse of Status A student's status may lapse for the following reasons: Failure to pay required student fees by the prescribed deadline; failure to respond to official notices; failure to settle financial obligations when due or to make satisfactory arrangements with the Cashier's Office; failure to complete the physical examination; or failure to comply with admission conditions. Each student who becomes subject to lapse of status action is given advance notice and ample time to deal with the situation. However, if the student fails to respond, action will be taken with\u00ad out further notice. A \"hold\" will be placed on all of the student's records and the student will be entitled to no further services of the University except assistance toward clearing the hold. A student must satisfy the conditions which caused the lapse of status before the hold can be cleared. Retention of Student Records The Registrar's Office maintains a permanent record of academic work completed by each student. Support documents for the acade\u00ad mic record are kept for one year. Students are strongly advised to carefully check their academic record quarterly. (Student grade reports are available at the Regis\u00ad trar's Office shortly after the close of each quarter.) Discrepancies in the academic record should be reported to the Registrar immedi\u00ad ately. After one year, it is assumed that the student accepts the accuracy of their academic record, and supporting source docu\u00ad ments are destroyed. Transcript of Records The transcript of a student's academic records will be released only upon receipt of a signed request of the student authorizing the release. Application may be made in person or by mail; telephoned requests cannot be honored because payment is due in advance. Application for a transcript should be submitted to the Cashier's Office with a check or money order payable to Regents-UC for the exact amount due. The fee for transcripts is $3 per copy. All out\u00ad standing debts to the University (with the exception of long-term financial aid loans not yet due and payable) must be paid in full before a transcript will be released. Requests for transcripts by other than the student whose transcript is being sought can be honored only (1) if the request is accompa\u00ad nied by a written authorization signed by the student whose tran\u00ad script is sought, and (2) upon approval of the Registrar. Such tran\u00ad scripts can be released by the Registrar only to another college, university, or educationally related agencies such as the Law School Data Admissions Service (LSD AS) or the American Med\u00ad ical College Application Service (AMCAS). When a student orders a transcript to be sent to another college, university, or agency, it is extremely important for the student to provide a complete, accurate mailing address to ensure delivery to the correct office. At least two weeks should be allowed for a tran\u00ad script to be received by another institution or agency. Verification of Student Status The Registrar's Office provides verifications of student status. Needs for which such verifications are performed include reference checks, bank loans, applications for good-student-driver insurance rates, and Social Security payments. There is a $3 fee for each ver\u00ad ification, however verifications for the purpose of student loan deferments are free of charge. For verification purposes, enroll\u00ad ment in 12 units or more in regular sessions is considered to be full-time status; enrollment in 6.0-11.9 units is considered to be half-time status; enrollment in 5.9 units or less is considered to be less than half-time status. Summer session enrollment in eight units is considered to be full-time status. Cancellation/Withdrawal Students who pay fees for a regular academic quarter and then decide to withdraw from the University must submit a Cancella\u00ad tion/Withdrawal form to the Registrar's Office after obtaining the signatures of their academic dean (or the Dean of the Division of Undergraduate Education, for undecided/undeclared students) and the University Ombudsman, for undergraduate students. Medical UC IRVINE - 1996-1997students must submit the form to the Curricular Affairs Office in the College of Medicine. This form serves two purposes: (1) a refund of fees, if applicable (see Fee Refund section); and (2) auto\u00ad matic withdrawal from classes. The effective date of withdrawal used in determining the percent\u00ad age of fees to be refunded is the date on which the student submits the withdrawal form to the Registrar's Office or to the Curricular Affairs Office. A W notation will be recorded for each course in which enrollment is withdrawn if the student's effective date of withdrawal is after the end of the sixth week of classes. (See W notation under Grad\u00ad ing System section.) A graduate student in good academic standing who wishes to with\u00ad draw and intends to return within one year should submit both the Cancellation/Withdrawal form and an application for a Leave of Absence. Further information about leaves of absence and cancel\u00ad lation/withdrawals appears in the Research and Graduate Studies section. New undergraduate students are encouraged to seek advice from their admissions or academic counselor to understand the conse\u00ad quences of withdrawal and their eligibility to return. If an under\u00ad graduate student plans to leave the University after completing all academic work for the latest quarter of enrollment and has not paid fees for the next quarter, a formal notice of withdrawal is not necessary. Readmission: Undergraduate Students Students are strongly urged to consider the readmission policy in formulating plans for leaving or returning to UCI. Every effort will be made to readmit UCI students who were in good academic standing at the time they ceased attending and who have filed read\u00ad mission applications by the deadline. Former UCI students who wish to be readmitted should contact the undergraduate counseling office of the school or program which offers their intended major. Readmission is not automatic. To apply for readmission, a student must first pay a nonrefundable $40 Application Fee at the Cashier's Office, and then file an Application for Readmission with the Registrar's Office at least eight weeks prior to the quarter in which readmission is desired. Readmission is subject to dean's approval and campus deadlines (August 1 for fall quarter, Novem\u00ad ber 1 for winter quarter, and February 1 for spring quarter). New undergraduate students who cancel registration prior to the first day of the quarter must reapply to UCI; they are not eligible to file for readmission as described above. If a student has been academically disqualified from the University or has left the University while on probation or subject to disquali\u00ad fication, the student must apply for readmission. The application, however, is subject to the approval of the dean of the school which the student hopes to enter. Transcripts for work taken at other institutions must be submitted as part of the application. A nonrefundable fee of $40 is charged for each Application for Readmission. Remittance by bank draft or money order payable to Regents-UC must be attached to the application. Readmission: Graduate Students A graduate student who withdraws and has not been granted a leave of absence approved by the Dean of Graduate Studies can resume graduate study only if readmitted. The Application for Admission must be submitted by the published deadline for graduate admis\u00ad sion applications. Please refer to the statement on readmission which appears in the Research and Graduate Studies section. Enrollment and Other Procedures 67 Intercampus Visitor: Undergraduates Only A currently registered UCI undergraduate student in good standing may apply for intercampus visitor status at another campus of the University for one quarter. Forms and instructions are available at the Registrar's Office. California Residence Detailed information about California residence is available in the Catalogue's Expenses and Fees section. All inquiries with regard to the requirements for the establishment of California residence (including exceptions pertaining to minors, aliens, and dependents of military personnel stationed in California) should be directed to the Residence Deputy, Registrar's Office, 215 Administration Building, University of California, Irvine, CA 92697-4975, tele\u00ad phone (714) 824-6129, or the Office of the Legal Analyst-Resi\u00ad dence Matters, 300 Lakeside Drive, 7th Floor, University of Cali\u00ad fornia, Oakland, CA 94612-3565. Commencement UCI Commencement ceremonies are held each June for all stu\u00ad dents who graduate any quarter of that academic year. Commence\u00ad ment protocol information is mailed to all prospective graduates in the spring and also is available from the academic counselors. Additional information is available from the Commencement Office; telephone (714) 824-6378. Application for Graduation. In order to receive a degree, an undergraduate student must file an Application for Graduation at the appropriate dean's office, preferably during the first quarter of the senior year, but no less than six months before the expected day of graduation. Specific deadline dates for filing the application are established quarterly so that candidates' academic records can be reviewed to verify that all graduation requirements have been met. Students should contact their academic counselor for deadline information. Diplomas. Students are advised by mail when their diplomas are available, which is three to four months after the quarter in which the degrees are awarded. Students may then pick up their diplomas at the Registrar's Office or authorize the Registrar to send their diplomas by certified mail, or registered air mail to locations out\u00ad side the United States. There is a service charge of $5 for certified mail, $10 for registered air mail, payable to Regents-UC. All out\u00ad standing debts due to the University, with the exception of long\u00ad term financial aid loans, must be paid in full before a student's diploma will be released. UC IRVINE - 1996-199768 UCI 1996-97 Information for Admitted Students ACADEMIC REGULATIONS AND PROCEDURES Except where noted, all information applies to both undergraduate and graduate students. Additional information concerning academic regulations applying only to graduate students is given in the Research and Graduate Studies section. Student Academic Records Student's official academic records are maintained permanently by the Registrar and are used for purposes such as academic advising, scholarship awards, admission to professional or graduate schools, and future employment. Each student is responsible for carefully examining their enroll\u00ad ment and academic records and may do so throughout the acade\u00ad mic year. Students must promptly notify the Registrar's Office if they find a discrepancy in their records. Since each student's current quarter class enrollment is put directly into the academic record system from telephone enrollment or source documents completed by the student, it is extremely impor\u00ad tant for each student to complete these entries or source documents (e.g., Add/Drop/Change cards) carefully and accurately. Student academic records may not be changed after one year or, in some cases, in less than one year if Academic Senate regulations specify a shorter time limit. For example, the notation \"NR,\" which means that no grade has been reported, must be removed within one quarter of subsequent enrollment or it will automati\u00ad cally be converted to the grade \"F\" or \"NP\" (under Senate Regula\u00ad tion IR 345). After a student's degree has been certified by the student's dean, the academic record may not be altered except in those cases where a procedural or clerical error on the part of an instructor has occurred. GRADING SYSTEM A-Excellent (4.0 grade points per unit) B -Good (3.0 grade points per unit) C -Average (2.0 grade points per unit) D -Lowest passing grade (1.0 grade point per unit) F -Not passing (no grade points) I -Incomplete P -Pass (equal to grade Cor better) NP-Not Pass (equal to grade C-or below) S -Satisfactory (equal to grade B or better; graduate students only in courses designated by the Graduate Council) U -Unsatisfactory (graduate students only in courses so desig\u00ad nated by the Graduate Council) IP-In Progress (restricted to certain sequential courses, so desig\u00ad nated by the Committee on Courses or Graduate Council, for which the final quarter grade of a multiquarter sequence course is assigned to the previous quarter(s) of the sequence) NR-No Report (given when an instructor's final grade course report is not submitted or when the student's name was on the official class roster but the instructor did not report a grade for the student; NR becomes an F or NP after one quarter of subse\u00ad quent enrollment or at the end of the quarter immediately pre\u00ad ceding award of the degree, whichever comes first. The instruc\u00ad tor, at the student's request, may replace an NR with a grade within one quarter of subsequent enrollment or may authorize the student to drop the class, which would result in the NR becoming a W). UR-Unauthorized Repeat. A UR notation is recorded for the grade when a student already has a passing grade for a nonre\u00ad peatable course and has repeated the course again. W-Withdrew. A W notation is recorded on a student's permanent record for each course a student drops after the end of the sixth week of instruction in a quarter. Courses in which a W has been entered on a student's record will be disregarded in determining the student's grade point average and will not be considered as courses attempted in assessing the student's satisfaction of the normal progress requirement. Plus and minus suffixes may be attached to the grades A, B, C, and D. GRADE POINTS AND GRADE POINT AVERAGE \u00b7 Grade points are assigned on a four point basis: A, 4 points per unit; B, 3 points per unit; C, 2 points per unit; D, 1 point per unit; F and I, zero points. Plus or minus suffixes modify the above by plus or minus 0.3 grade point per unit, with the exception of the A+ grade which is assigned 4 points per unit. Requirements for a bachelor's degree, with the exception of certain programs in Engineering, include the accumulation of baccalaure\u00ad ate credit for a minimum of 180 quarter units with an average of at least C (grade point average of at least 2.0). A course at UCI nor\u00ad mally offers four quarter units of credit, and, in the following text, the term \"course\" may be understood to carry four units. The grade point average is the sum of all accumulated grade points (grade points earned in a course taken for a letter grade times the unit value of the course) divided by the sum of all units attempted. P, NP, S, U, NR, IP, and I grades, as well as workload credit, are excluded in computing grade point average. Baccalaureate credit counts toward degree requirements and is used to compute the grade point average. Workload credit is used to determine full-time status for financial aid, housing, student loans, and other purposes. For most courses at UCI, baccalaureate credit and workload credit are identical. Courses differing in this credit or \"workload credit only\" courses are identified in the course description. It should be noted that final grades as reported by professors are normally permanent and final. A professor may not change a final grade except to correct a clerical or procedural error. Clerical or procedural errors should be corrected within one regular academic quarter after the grade is assigned. No grade may be revised by reexamination or, with the exception of I imd IP grades, by com\u00ad pleting additional work. If a student is dissatisfied with a grade, the student should review their work with the instructor and receive an explanation of the grade assigned. A grade may be appealed on any reasonable grounds to the instructor, the chair of the department, and the dean of the school. If the matter is not resolved, the student may go for counsel to the Office of the University Ombudsman. Under circumstances explained in the Academic Grievance Proce\u00ad dures (Manual of the Irvine Division of the Academic Senate, Appendix II), a grade may be changed if the Academic Grievance Panel has determined that the grade was assigned on the basis of discrimination. INCOMPLETE GRADES An I or Incomplete grade is assigned to a student by an instructor when the student's work is of passing quality but is incomplete because of circumstances beyond the student's control, and when the student has been temporarily excused by the instructor from completing the quarter's work. For currently enrolled students, the maximum time limit for mak\u00ad ing up an I grade is three quarters of enrollment. After this time the I grade can no longer be replaced and will appear permanently on the record. The instructor is not obligated to allow the maximum three-quarter period. The student should consult the instructor to UC IRVINE - 1996-1997determine how the Incomplete may be made up. It is strongly rec\u00ad ommended that the student and the instructor prepare a written agreement specifying how the Incomplete can be made up and the deadline for doing so. Once the work is completed within a time agreed upon by the instructor, the student should ask the instructor to submit a change of grade form to the counseling office of the school in which the course was offered. The student should not reenroll in the course to make up the Incomplete. Students not currently enrolled at UCI have a maximum of one cal\u00ad endar year in which to replace an Incomplete grade. However, in exceptional individual cases involving the student's prolonged inability to pursue a course of study, extensions of up to two addi\u00ad tional years may be granted by the instructor with the approval of the dean of the unit offering the course; students must petition for such an extension within one calendar year following the assign\u00ad ment of the Incomplete grade. Courses graded I carry no grade points and are not included in computation of the grade point average which appears on the stu\u00ad dent's permanent record. Any I grade will remain indefinitely on the permanent record unless the work is completed and a grade assigned as described above. University of California regulations require a grade point average of 2.0 for all units attempted in order to receive a bachelor's degree. Only when a check for satisfaction of graduation require\u00ad ments is made are I's treated as F's. If the student's overall average is at least a 2.0, including the Incomplete grades computed as F's, then the student may graduate. If the Incomplete grades computed as F's decrease the student's average below a 2.0, the student may not graduate until enough I grades have been made up to bring the average up to a 2.0 and this must be done within the time limits specified abov'e. PASS/NOT PASS The Pass/Not Pass option is available to encourage students to enroll in courses outside their major field. Courses graded Pass or Not Pass are not included in computation of the grade point aver\u00ad age which appears on a student's permanent record. However, if a student receives a Pass in a class, course and unit credit for the class is received, except as provided below. If a Not Pass is received, the student receives no credit for the class. Some courses are designated by academic units as Pass/Not Pass Only. Students do not have the option of taking these courses for a letter grade. The use of Pass/Not Pass is governed by all of the following provisions: 1. A student in good standing may take up to an average of four units per quarter on a Pass/Not Pass basis. 2. In addition, students may count a total of 12 units of courses des\u00ad ignated Pass/Not Pass Only toward their graduation requirements. 3. A student who earns a grade of C (2.0) or better will have a Pass/Not Pass grade recorded as Pass. If the student earns a grade of C-or below, the grade will be recorded as a Not Pass, and no unit credit will be received for the course. In both cases, the student's grade will not be computed into the grade point average. 4. Courses taken under the Pass/Not Pass option may count toward the unit requirement for the bachelor's degree and toward the breadth requirement. With the exception of courses designated Pass/Not Pass Only, courses taken Pass/Not Pass may not be used to satisfy specific course requirements of the student's school and major, unless authorized by the appropriate dean. No more than two courses applied to a minor may be taken Pass/Not Pass. Academic Regulations and Procedures 69 Graduate students may take one course (up to four units) per quarter on a Pass/Not Pass basis. However, such courses are not considered part of the student's graduate program, may not be applied to the requirements for an advanced degree, and do not count toward the minimum number of units for which a gradu\u00ad ate student must enroll. 5. Changes to or from the Pass/Not Pass option must be made dur\u00ad ing the enrollment period. No changes can be made after the first two weeks of classes without the approval of the dean of the student's school. No changes in the Pass/Not Pass option can be made after the last day of instruction of the quarter. 6. A student on academic probation may not enroll in a course with the Pass/Not Pass option unless the course is offered on that basis only. SATISFACTORY/UNSATISFACTORY GRADES (GRADUATE STUDENTS ONLY) Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory grading, unlike Pass/Not Pass, is not a student option. With the consent of the academic units involved, individual study and research or other individual graduate work undertaken by a graduate student may be evaluated by means of the grades S or U. With the approval of the Graduate Council, cer\u00ad tain graduate courses are graded SID Only. Also, the grade S or U may be assigned provisionally in each but the last quarter of a graduate course extending over more than one quarter. Upon com\u00ad pletion of the last quarter, letter grades (A to F) replace such provi\u00ad sional grades. When a grade of S or U has been assigned on a pro\u00ad visional basis and the student does not complete all quarters of the course sequence, the instructor may assign a final letter grade or the grade of I to replace the S or U, or let the grade of S or U stand as a final grade. The gradeS is defined as equivalent to a grade of B (3.0) or better. No credit will be allowed for work graded Unsatisfactory. GRADES IN PROGRESS IP is a transcript notation, restricted to sequential courses which extend over two or more quarters, indicating that the final grade for the individual quarters will not be assigned until the last quarter of the sequence is completed. The grade for the final quarter is then assigned for all of the previous quarters of the sequence. No credit is given until the student has completed the entire sequence. IP notations may be given only for courses designated by the Aca\u00ad demic Senate Committee on Courses or Graduate Council for use of this notation. IP notations are not included in computations of the student's grade point average and do not contribute to the num\u00ad ber of quarter units completed. GRADES NOT REPORTED A student who receives an NR must immediately contact the instructor and arrange for the removal or replacement of the NR. An NR becomes an F or NP after one quarter of subsequent enroll\u00ad ment or at the end of the quarter immediately preceding award of the degree, whichever comes first. NR transcript notations are not included in computations of the grade point average and do not contribute to the number of quarter units completed. REPETITION OF COURSES With approval from their school or program, undergraduates may repeat courses only when grades of C-, D+, D, D-, F, or NP were received or when the course has been approved for repetition. (A C-earned before fall quarter, 1984, is not repeatable.) Degree credit for courses so repeated will be given only once, but the grade assigned at each enrollment shall be permanently recorded. In computing the grade point average of an undergraduate with repeated courses in which a C-, D+, D, D-, F, or NP (if repeated for a letter grade) was received, only the most recently received UC IRVINE - 1996-199770 UCI 1996-97 Information for Admitted Students grades and grade points shall be used for the first 16 units repeated. In case of further repetitions, the grade point average shall be based on all additional grades assigned. All courses which were originally taken for a letter grade must be repeated for a letter grade. Courses originally taken on a Pass/Not Pass basis may be repeated for a Pass/Not Pass or for a letter grade if the course is so offered. A graduate student may repeat only once a course in which a grade below B or a grade of U was received. Only the most recently earned grade shall be used in computing the student's grade point average for the first eight units of repeated work; thereafter both the earlier and the later grades will be used. If a student repeats a course for which a passing grade has already been received and the course is not approved as repeatable for credit, the student will receive a UR and no credit will be given. Information regarding the repetition of foreign language courses is available in the School of Humanities section. SATISFACTION OF THE WRITING REQUIREMENT Students enrolled at UCI may take only UCI courses in satisfaction of the lower-division and upper-division writing requirements. Continuing UCI students may not take summer courses at another institution to satisfy lower-division or upper-division writing requirements. The two courses taken to fulfill the lower-division Writing requirement must be completed with a grade of C or better. 1. Students who fail to attain a letter grade of C or better in Eng\u00ad lish and Comparative Literature WR37 must repeat the course or enroll in the equivalent. It is recommended that these students enroll in WR39A followed by WR39B-C to assure completion of this requirement. Students who fail to attain a grade of C or better in WR39C must repeat the course. 2. Students who fail to attain a grade of C or better in one or both courses of the English and Comparative Literature WR39B-C sequence must repeat the course or courses in question. 3. Students who fail to attain a grade of Cor better in at least.two quarters of the writing component of the Humanities Core Course after satisfying the Subject A requirement should substi\u00ad tute English and Comparative Literature WR39C if they need one quarter of additional work to complete the requirement, or English and Comparative Literature WR39B-C if they need two quarters to complete the requirement. The course taken to fulfill the upper-division writing requirement must be completed with a grade of Cor better (or a Pass or Credit grade equivalent to C). See the UCI Requirements section for fur\u00ad ther information. Credit by Examination An enrolled student may obtain credit for many courses by taking a special examination administered by a faculty member who nor\u00ad mally teaches that course. Detailed procedures for obtaining credit by examination may be obtained from the office of the dean of the school which offers the course. Approval of any petition for credit by examination must be obtained from the dean of that school before the examination can be administered. After the dean has signed the petition, the student must have it validated by paying a $5 Credit by Examination Fee at the Cashier's Office. The instructor giving the examination retains the prerogative (1) to decide whether the course can be taken by examination, (2) to determine the form such an examination may take, and (3) to stipu\u00ad late whether the grade will be reported as Pass/Not Pass or as a let\u00ad ter grade (e.g., A, B, C, etc.). A student may take the examination for a particular course only one time. After receiving the grade, the student may accept it or reject it. If the student is not satisfied with the grade received on the examination, the student may choose not to receive credit or a grade. If the student does choose to accept the results of the exami\u00ad nation, grades and grade points (if applicable) will be entered on the record in the same manner as those for regular courses of instruction. Independent Study: Undergraduates Only Another class option is available primarily to upper-division stu\u00ad dents at UCI. The independent-study option allows the student to plan with the instructor a course having a cleai relationship to the student's academic program. The plan for the course will include a reading list, a group of assignments, examinations, papers, or simi\u00ad lar evidence of intellectual achievement on which academic credit will be based. A description of the course and of its requirements must be approved by the instructor responsible for it and by the department chair or dean. Independent-study credit for undergradu\u00ad ates is limited to five units per quarter. Final Examinations Final examinations are obligatory in all undergraduate courses except laboratory and studio courses, or their equivalent, as indi\u00ad vidually determined by the Committee on Courses. In laboratory and studio courses, the department concerned may at its option require a final examination subject to prior announcement in the Schedule of Classes for the term. Normally each such examination shall be conducted in writing and must be completed by all partici\u00ad pants by the announced time shown in the Schedule of Classes for the quarter in question. These examinations may not exceed three hours duration. Special arrangements may be made for disabled students. \u00b7 Final grade reports from professors are due in the Registrar's Office within 72 hours after the final examination. Student Copies of Quarterly Grades After each quarter, a copy of the student's permanent record is available from the Registrar's Office. On the copy, the student will find grades for all the quarters taken at UCI, a computation of grade point average at the University of California, and a list of the University requirements completed (Subject A, American History, and American Institutions). Undergraduate Scholarship Requirements Requirements for a bachelor's degree, with the exception of certain programs in Engineering, include the accumulation of credit for a minimum of 180 quarter units witli an average of at least C (grade point average of at least 2.0). CLASS LEVEL Undergraduate students are classified as freshman, sophomore, junior, or senior students, based on the total number of units acquired, as follows: Freshman Sophomore Junior Senior 0 45.0 90.0 135+ COURSE LOAD LIMITS 44.9 89.9 134.9 An undergraduate may enroll in as few as 12 units or as many as 20 units. To enroll for more than 20 units or fewer than 12 units, students must obtain the authorization of their dean or, for unde\u00ad cided/undeclared students, the Dean of the Division of Undergrad\u00ad uate Education. Refer to Part-time Study in the Index. UC IRVINE - 1996-1997ACADEMIC STANDING To remain in good academic standing a student must maintain a grade point average of at least 2.0 and make progress toward the degree at a satisfactory rate. An undergraduate student normally is subject to academic proba\u00ad tion if at the end of any quarter the grade point average for that quarter, or the cumulative grade point average, is less than 2.0. A student whose grade point average falls below a 1.5 for any quarter, or who after two consecutive quarters on probation has not achieved a cumulative grade point average of 2.0 or a satisfactory rate of progress, is subject to disqualification. NORMAL PROGRESS REQUIREMENT Regular undergraduate students will become subject to probation or subject to disqualification from further registration in the Uni\u00ad versity if they fail to make normal progress toward the baccalaure\u00ad ate degree. 1. Normal progress for all regular undergraduate students is defined in the following table, in terms of quarter units com\u00ad pleted at the end of quarters enrolled. Normal Subject to Subject to Quarter Progress Probation Disqualification 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 23 39 55 71 88 105 123 141 159 2. A student who at the end of a given quarter of enrollment has completed the number of units in the range specified in the \"Normal Progress\" category under (1) is making normal progress. A student who at the end of a given quarter of enroll\u00ad ment has completed a number of units in the range specified in the \"Subject to Probation\" category under (1) is subject to being placed on probation by the faculty of that student's school or program or its designated agent or, for undecided/ undeclared students, by the Faculty Board for Unaffiliated Students or its designated agent. A student who at the end of a given quarter of enrollment has completed no more than a number of units in the range specified in the \"Subject to Disqualification\" category under (1) is subject to disqualification by the faculty of that stu\u00ad dent's school or program or its designated agent or, for unde\u00ad cided/undeclared students, by the Faculty Board for Unaffiliated Students or its designated agent. 3. Students who have completed two consecutive quarters on acad\u00ad emic probation without having achieved at the end of that period at least the normal rate of progress specified under (1) are sub\u00ad ject to disqualification. A student will be allowed to continue on probation only if the record indicates likely achievement of the required scholastic standing within a reasonable time. 4. For purposes of calculating \"Normal Progress,\" \"Subject to Pro\u00ad bation,\" and \"Subject to Disqualification,\" students admitted to the University with advanced standing will be classified with respect to quarter of enrollment at entrance in accordance with the following table: Academic Regulations and Procedures 71 Quarter at Entrance 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 Advanced Standing Quarter Units at earned under the following two circumstances are not to be counted toward determination of the quarter at entrance under (4) above: (a) Advanced Placement Examination; (b) con\u00ad current enrollment in college courses while in high school. 6. The quarter of enrollment at entrance of students (including bac\u00ad calaureate degree candidates who already hold a baccalaureate degree) seeking admission to the University with 150 or more advanced standing units will be determined by the faculty offer\u00ad ing the curriculum in which such students seek to enroll. This determination will be made consistent with the program required for such students to obtain the desired degree and with Univer\u00ad sity residence requirements. 7. The Normal Progress requirement described above is not to be confused with the Normal Academic Progress requirement for Financial Aid. The former has to do with academic standing, the latter with receipt of financial aid. (Additional information is available in the Financial Aid at UCI handbook.) Probation is not a necessary step before disqualification. If a stu\u00ad dent becomes subject to disqualification, the complete record of grades and other accomplishments will be carefully reviewed by the responsible faculty authorities of the student's school or, for undecided/undeclared students, by the Faculty Board for Unaffili\u00ad ated Students. If the record indicates little probability that the stu\u00ad dent will be able to meet the academic standards of the University of California, the student will be disqualified from further enroll\u00ad ment. Each school and department is obliged by Academic Senate regulations to maintain a procedure under which a student may appeal probation and disqualification actions. In order to transfer from one campus to another in the University of California or from one UCI school to another, a student who has been disqualified or who is on academic probation must obtain the approval of the appropriate faculty, or its designated agent, into whose jurisdiction the student seeks to transfer. HONORS Information about honors opportunities at UCI is found in the Planning an Undergraduate Program section and the academic unit sections. Quarterly Undergraduate Honors Quarterly undergraduate honors are awarded in each school to stu\u00ad dents who achieve a quarterly grade point average of 3.5 or better in a minimum of 12 graded units. Honors at Graduation Students may graduate with honors, summa cum laude, magna cum laude, or cum laude. The criteria used by each school in selecting candidates for these honors are included in each school's section of the Catalogue. A general criterion is that students must have com\u00ad pleted at least 72 units in residence at a University of California campus. Additional information is available in the Division of Undergraduate Education section of this Catalogue. UC IRVINE - 1996-199772 UCI 1996-97 Information for Admitted Students Graduate Scholarship Requirements For a graduate student, only the grades A+, A, A-, B+, B, and S represent satisfactory scholarship. Information concerning graduate student course load requirements and satisfactory academic progress is given in the Research and Graduate Studies section. Enrollment in University Extension If a UCI student wishes to enroll in a University Extension course concurrently with enrollment in regular courses, the entire program of study must be approved in advance by the dean of the student's school (in the case of graduate students, by the Dean of Graduate Studies). Fee information is available from the University Exten\u00ad sion Registration Office. Credits From Other Institutions or University Extension: Undergraduate Students UCI undergraduate students who plan to enroll in courses at another institution in either a summer or regular session and to use such courses to satisfy any UCI requirements should first consult with and secure prior approval from the academic dean or chair of their major who will determine if the credits are applicable to major and breadth requirements. UCI undergraduate students must submit an official transcript of all course work earned at another institution or college to the Office of Admissions and Relations with Schools. If such courses are determined by the Office of Admissions and Relations with Schools to be transferable, do not duplicate other credit granted, and do not exceed limitations of credit, then the units earned may be applied toward the total required for graduation. Credits From Other Institutions or University Extension: Graduate Students Graduate students may be granted unit credit (not grade credit) toward a master's degree for a limited number of acceptable gradu\u00ad ate-level courses completed at another institution or through Uni\u00ad versity Extension before enrollment in graduate study at UCI. To receive such credit, the student must submit a formal petition, including an original transcript, after enrollment in graduate study. Approval of the student's graduate advisor and the Dean of Gradu\u00ad ate Studies is required. While enrolled at UCI or on a leave of absence, a graduate student may receive unit credit for graduate-level courses completed at another institution or through University Extension only with the prior approval of the student's graduate advisor and the Dean of Graduate Studies. See the Research and Graduate Studies section for further informa\u00ad tion about graduate transfer credit and the University's Intercam\u00ad pus Exchange Program.

RESEARCH The University of California is the State's primary research institu\u00ad tion. Most scholarly research and creative activities are supported by University funds or by grants and contracts from federal and state agencies, foundations, corporations, and individual sponsors. Faculty at UCI participate in activities in many traditional fields of endeavor as well as in \"new\" interdisciplinary pursuits. For exam\u00ad ple, in the humanities, UCI has become a world center for the study of critical theory. In physics, UCI scientists are involved in ongoing studies on the nature of subatomic particles. Members of the Chemistry faculty are leaders in the study of atmospheric phe\u00ad nomena such as ozone depletion. Faculty research in biomedical sciences covers a wide range of areas including neuroscience, mol\u00ad ecular biology, genetics, and cancer-related studies. The Vice Chancellor for Research has responsibility for activities including research administration, research policy, research devel\u00ad opment, organized research activities, UCI-industry relations involving research, animal research administration, and research committee support. In addition, the Vice Chancellor is responsible for contract and grant administration which includes the submis\u00ad sion of proposals, acceptance of grant and contract awards, and negotiation of all awards for extramurally funded research, train\u00ad ing, fellowship, and public service programs. While most research takes place at the academic unit level, the academic quality of many of UCI's educational programs is enhanced by interdisciplinary research activity represented in Organized Research Units, Irvine Research Units, and Focused Research Programs that extend beyond unit boundaries. Office of University/Industry Research and Technology The Office of University/Industry Research and Technology (DIRT) fosters and coordinates relationships between UCI and industry in sponsored research and technology transfer programs. Specific services for faculty include searches for industrial research support, agreements for research materials transfer and testing, assistance with invention disclosures, patentability assess\u00ad ment, and conflict of interest administration. Specific services for business and industry include access and linkages to faculty researchers, licensing technology, assistance with research con\u00ad tracts, intellectual property, research materials transfer, and tech\u00ad nology information. DIRT acts as a coordinating focal point for all elements necessary for faculty to establish formal research and technology linkages with companies. .

University of California Humanities Research Institute The University of California Humanities Research Institute, located at UCI, was founded in 1987 to serve as the humanities center for the nine campuses of the University of California. UCHRI's distinctive mission is to foster intellectual community across campus boundaries, to mobilize the strength of the Univer\u00ad sity of California humanities faculty as a whole, and to promote innovative collaborative and interdisciplinary research in the humanities and related disciplines. At the heart of UCHRI's activities are the Residential Research Groups which bring together both UC and non-UC faculty and advanced UC graduate students to work in collaboration on inter\u00ad disciplinary topics. The Institute also offers the possibility of multi-year programs of coordinated residential research groups and conferences. Office space for up to 23 resident fellows and modest housing on the UCI campus is provided. UCHRI sponsors scholarly conferences both at the Institute and on the various UC campuses, as well as seminars and workshops for a variety of planning purposes. In addition, UCHRI has an agree\u00ad ment with the University of California Press regarding publication of scholarly work from its conferences and residential groups; scholarly work done under the auspices of UCHRI has also appeared under a variety of other imprints. UC IRVINE - 1996-1997Organized Research Units Organized Research Units (ORUs) normally consist of an inter\u00ad departmental group of faculty, students, and other researchers engaged in a continuing program of multidisciplinary or interdisci\u00ad plinary research, supported by both University and extramural funding. The work of some ORUs is directed toward the solution of complex contemporary problems, while others conduct basic research essential to the understanding of natural or social phe\u00ad nomena or of humanistic ideas and expressions. The following Organized Research Units have been established on the Irvine campus by The Regents of the University. CANCER RESEARCH INSTITUTE The Cancer Research Institute provides leadership and support for researchers working toward understanding and controlling cancer. The Institute serves as a means of focusing, coordinating, and directing efforts of scholars in basic and clinical sciences from several departments of the School of Biological Sciences and the College of Medicine. It provides a central source of information concerning cancer-related research, as well as a forum in which basic researchers and clinicians can assess advances that may be of immediate value in the diagnosis and treatment of cancer, and in the detection of chemicals or conditions that cause cancer. Ongoing and projected research activities involve the regulation of cell function, viral carcinogenesis, immunology, and basic molecular processes relevant to cancer. The Cancer Research Institute serves as the basic science arm of a National Cancer Institute-designated Cancer Center, which also includes the Chao Family Clinical Can\u00ad cer Research Center and the Cancer Surveiilance Program of Orange County. Research 83 CENTER FOR THE NEUROBIOLOGY OF LEARNING AND MEMORY The Center for the Neurobiology of Learning and Memory fosters multidisciplinary research concerning the neurobiological processes underlying learning and memory. Research efforts are stimulated and coordinated through research seminars, colloquia, quarterly meetings, and international conferences, as well as col\u00ad laborative research projects involving faculty members of the Cen\u00ad ter, research associates, visiting fellows, postdoctoral fellows, graduate students, and undergraduate students. Research programs include investigations at several levels of analysis including cell chemistry, cell physiology, brain systems, cognitive processes, and neural modeling. Members include faculty from the Departments of Cognitive Sciences, Psychobiology, Pharmacology, and Physics and Astronomy, as well as faculty from other UC campuses. CENTER FOR RESEARCH ON INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY AND ORGANIZATIONS The Center for Research on Information Technology and Organiza\u00ad tions (CRITO) is a multidisciplinary Organized Research Unit that conducts theoretical and empirical research in the field of informa\u00ad tion technology (IT). CRITO focuses on the management, use, and impact of IT in the emerging global, competitive marketplace, and the policy issues raised by its use. Under its umbrella, CRITO researchers pursue three programs of study: organizational implica\u00ad tions of information technology, management of information tech\u00ad nology, and technology policy and societal issues. Faculty from the Graduate School of Management, the Department of Information and Computer Science, the School of Social Sciences, UC IRVINE - 1996-199784 UCI 1996-97 Research and Graduate Studies and the Department of Education conduct research through the unit. There are approximately 15 faculty associates and 30-45 students i~volved in research administered by CRITO. CRITO's research projects also reflect a multidisciplinary nature. Ongoing studies include how computer integrated manufacturing (CIM) and world-class manufacturing practices assist coordination in manufacturing firms; the study and survey of the impacts of \u00b7 computing on work groups in office settings; the analysis of the effects of IT on the restructuring of work, employee performance, quality of work life, and differences in these outcomes based on gender; and studies of global growth of use of computers and other information technologies. Faculty research also involves the effects of computerization on work in organizations; interorganizational systems; information, control, and organization performance; IT investments; effectiveness of computers in government; computer support systems for group decision making; computers in the home; informatization of society; and estimation of demand for computing the U.S. In support of these research programs, CRITO sponsors regular seminars among faculty and students; cosponsors and hosts talks by nationally and internationally distinguished researchers in the field; assists in the preparation of proposals to government, foun\u00ad dations, and industry for extramural funding to support research programs and training of the next generation of researchers; and maintains a working paper series of reports and publications docu\u00ad menting its research. In addition, CRITO works with the campus academic units to match students with graduate assistantships and work-study positions that are available in conjunction with CRITO research projects. CRITICAL THEORY INSTITUTE The Critical Theory Institute provides a locus for the conduct and support of collaborative, interdisciplinary research focused on the theoretical underpinnings of such fields as history, literature, phi\u00ad losophy, art, and politics. The Institute's principal function is to provide a forum for debate among competing movements in con\u00ad temporary critical theory so that existing theoretical models can be challenged and refined. The Institute's research consists not only of the application of theory to data but also of self-reflexive investi\u00ad gation of theoretical presuppositions in order to produce alternative theoretical constructs and strategies. The Institute investigates problems according to three-year research programs, which are concluded with the publication of results. A recently completed research project of the Institute con\u00ad cerns the complex relations among politics, theory, and contempo\u00ad rary culture in current critical theories. The results are published in Politics, Theory and Contemporary Culture, edited by Institute Director Mark Poster (Columbia University Press, 1993). Research on \"Culture and the Problem of the Disciplines\" investi\u00ad gates how and why the question of culture has become a focus of theorizing in several disciplines and intellectual currents. The goal in this project is both to explore the role that cultural presupposi\u00ad tions and theories of culture have played in critical theory and to explore the theoretical presuppositions underpinning the notion of culture in its various historical and disciplinary forms. The Institute's newest research project, \"The Transnational Net\u00ad works of Globalization,\" will investigate four networks contribut\u00ad ing to new theories of international and global organization: corpo\u00ad rate, cultural, technological, and environmental. This project began with research contributions from members of the Institute and dis\u00ad tinguished visitors to the Institute in 1995 and will be completed in 1998. The Institute also sponsors various research ventures with other institutions of higher education, including the 1995 Summer Insti\u00ad tute on \"American Literature, Multiculturalism, and Critical Theory,\" sponsored by the National Endowment for the Humanities, Divi\u00ad sion of Education, and involving faculty from high schools, com\u00ad munity colleges, and four-year colleges and universities in the \u00b7southern California region. The Institute organizes colloquia, lectures, seminars, and work\u00ad shops in which leading theorists from the United States and abroad participate in its research projects. It also sponsors the annual Wellek Library Lectures in which a leading theorist gives a series of lectures on a topic of importance in critical theory. DEVELOPMENTAL BIOLOGY CENTER The Developmental Biology Center (DBC) provides focus and sup\u00ad port for research in developmental biology in several departments of the School of Biological Sciences and the College of Medicine. The research activities are concerned with identifying the activities of cells that convert the fertilized egg into a fully formed and func\u00ad tioning organism. DBC investigators are studying the processes of cell division, migration, and differentiation at the molecular, genetic, and cellular levels using a variety of experimental organ\u00ad isms, as well as human material. The DBC is the site of a National Science Foundation Biological Facilities Center which provides the latest technology in microscopic imaging, computer-based image processing and analysis, flow cytometry and single-cell microinjec\u00ad tion. These facilities are part of the Optical Biology Shared Resource Facility of UCI's newly designated National Cancer Institute Cancer Center. One of the DBC investigators is director of a National Human Genome Research Center at UCI responsible for mapping chromosome 5. The DBC administers two National Institutes of Health training grants, one in developmental mechanisms underlying congenital defects and one in developmental neurobiology; these provide sup\u00ad port for both graduate students and postdoctoral investigators. The DBC sponsors and organizes local, national, and international conferences and hosts visiting scientists for collaborative research work. The results of the work will contribute to the understanding of normal development, growth control, and the regeneration of body parts as well as abnormalities that lead to birth defects, can\u00ad cer, and nervous-system malfunction in the human body. INSTITUTE FOR BRAIN AGING AND DEMENTIA The goal of the Institute is to mobilize and unify University resources to discover meaningful ways to prevent decline in brain function with aging prior to its inception and to reverse loss of function once it has occurred. The elusive, yet attainable goal of \"successful aging,\" maintaining functionality in one's later years, is one of the great challenges facing the nation in the next century. While many individuals continue to maintain and even improve their intellectual and cognitive skills, others suffer a serious and seemingly irreversible loss of cognitive function and develop dementias, most commonly Alzheimer's disease. The Institute is a fully integrated basic science/clinical research program that oper\u00ad ates: a Dementia Assessment and Treatment Clinic; a Brain Imag\u00ad ing Acquisition/Analysis Unit; a Tissue Repository for cellular and molecular analysis of the aged and Alzheimer's brain; and a com\u00ad prehensive database of clinical and research data. Research is mul\u00ad tidisciplinary employing the latest techniques in computer science, artificial intelligence, molecular biology, and neuroscience. The Institute also sponsors a specialized educational track in brain aging and dementia for advanced students who wish to develop a career opportunity in an exciting and expanding field. The Institute is the site of a National Institute on Aging Alzheimer's Disease Research Center (jointly with the University of Southern Califor\u00ad nia) and a State of California Department of Health Alzheimer's Disease Diagnostic and Treatment Center. Faculty from the Departments of Psychobiology, Neurology, Radiology, Anatomy and Neurobiology, Molecular Biology and UC IRVINE - 1996-1997Biochemistry, Microbiology and Molecular Genetics, Cognitive Sciences, Information and Computer Science, and Electrical and Computer Engineering, and the School of Social Ecology comprise the Institute's core group of investigators. INSTITUTE FOR MATHEMATICAL BEHAVIORAL SCiENCES The goal of the Institute for Mathematical Behavioral Sciences is to foster research in the application of mathematical methods to describe and to better understand human behavior, both individual and social. The Institute sponsors specialized seminars and collo\u00ad quia, a visiting scholars program, summer workshops, and focused research groups of faculty, students, and visitors, and it maintains a Technical Report Series. Facilities include a computer network for research purposes. Participants include faculty from the Depart\u00ad ments of Cognitive Sciences, Economics, Politics and Society, Anthropology, and Sociology in the School of Social Sciences; the Department of Mathematics in the School of Physical Sciences; the Department of Philosophy in the School of Humanities; and the Graduate School of Management. INSTITUTE FOR SURFACE AND INTERFACE SCIENCE The Institute for Surface and Interface Science (ISIS) brings together faculty and researchers in the fields of chemistry, physics, and electrical engineering for collaborative projects aimed at advancing knowledge through interdisciplinary research. ISIS affil\u00ad iates engage in the study of phenomena which occur at the bound\u00ad aries between phases of matter. The properties of surfaces and interfaces control a wide variety of technologically important effects and processes. Among these are corrosion and lubrication incidents, the behavior of semiconductor devices, the fabrication of integrated circuits, and the performance of catalysts used in auto\u00ad mobile exhaust systems and throughout the chemical industry. Research conducted within the Institute is funded by a variety of extramural sources including private industry as well as several federal agencies. Collectively, research funds also help support a number of ISIS-sponsored activities, including a Distinguished Lecturer Program which brings senior scholars from around the world to UCI, visiting fellows programs, postdoctoral fellowships, seminar presentations, student research forums, and workshops. INSTITUTE OF TRANSPORTATION STUDIES The Institute of Transportation Studies (ITS), a University of Cali\u00ad fornia Organized Research Unit with branches at Irvine, Davis, and Berkeley, was established to foster research, education, and train\u00ad ing in the field of transportation. A fundamental goal of the Insti\u00ad tute is the stimulation of interdisciplinary research on contempo\u00ad rary.transportation issues. ITS research at UCI involves faculty and students from the Schools of Engineering, Social Ecology, and Social Sciences; the Graduate School of Management; and the Department of Information and Computer Science. The Institute also hosts visiting scholars from the U.S. and abroad to facilitate collaborative research and information exchange, and sponsors conferences and colloquia to disseminate research results. Research at ITS covers a broad spectrum of transportation issues. Current funded research projects at ITS Irvine focus upon: intelli\u00ad gent transportation systems, particularly advanced transportation management systems; planning and analysis of transportation sys\u00ad tems; transportation systems operation and control; artificial intel\u00ad ligence applications; transportation engineering; transportation safety; administrative issues in public transit; and envi\u00ad ronmental and energy issues. The Institute is part of the University of California Transportation Center, one of 10 Federally designated centers for transportation research. The ITS Advanced Transportation Management Systems Research 85 (ATMS) Laboratories provide facilities for the teaching, research, and development of intelligent transportation systems. These labo\u00ad ratories form the backbone of the State of California's research ini\u00ad tiative in ATMS. The transportation research program at UCI is supported by the ITS Transportation Library at UC Berkeley. In addition, ITS at UCI subscribes to all transportation research journals and offers a vari\u00ad ety of computer-based information retrieval services. The Institute maintains a regular publication series which docu\u00ad ments research conducted within its programs. ITS also is the edi\u00ad torial headquarters of four international journals-Transportation Research Part A: Policy and Practice; Transportation Research Part B: Methodological; Transportation Research Part C: Emerg\u00ad ing Technologies; and Accident Analysis and Prevention. These journals are received by over 2,000 subscribers throughout the world. The Institute works closely with campus academic units to enhance graduate education in the areas of transportation planning, engi\u00ad neering, management, and policy. Courses of study leading to graduate degrees in the Schools of Engineering, Social Ecology, and Social Sciences are available for students interested in trans\u00ad portation studies. The Institute extends its support to a large num\u00ad ber of graduate students from these various disciplines, enabling students to enrich their studies by participating in ongoing research. Irvine Research Units Irvine Research Units (IRU) are established on the Irvine campus for the purpose of providing an organizational structure for the conduct of research that is difficult or infeasible to be carried out within the normal school or departmental structure. Irvine Research Units normally are established for a period of five years, and may provide the basis for establishment of extramurally sup\u00ad ported research centers or Organized Research Units. ADVANCED COMPUTING The IRU in Advanced Computing (known as RUAC) was created with the purpose of providing a common research home for all investigators who use highly complex and advanced computing in theoretical or experimental research. RUAC promotes focused or interdisciplinary research where high-performance computing or computational sciences are the main tool or objective. RUAC has also initiated an Industry/University Consortium Center for Numerical Algorithm Development. Its activities include, but are not limited to: seminars, public lectures, symposia, formal or infor\u00ad mal gatherings, and one-day work group sessions which include industry. Undergraduate, graduate, postdoctoral, and continuing education research opportunities are actively pursued as part of RUAC's activities. ANIMAL VIROLOGY The Program in Animal Virology combines basic science and clini\u00ad cal faculty in the Departments of Molecular Biology and Biochem\u00ad istry in the School of Biological Sciences, and the Departments of Microbiology and Molecular Genetics, and Pathology in the Col\u00ad lege of Medicine in an interactive and collaborative environment united with a common interest in aspects of animal virology. The program is also an integral part of the National Cancer Institute\u00ad designated Chao Family Clinical Cancer Research Center at UCI. The major goal of the program is to provide a collaborative resource for the dissemination of expertise in a number of animal virus systems as models and vectors for the study of molecular aspects of pathogenesis, gene expression, and gene delivery. UC IRVINE - 1996-199786 UCI 1996-97 Research and Graduate Studies COMPUTER SYSTEMS DESIGN The IRU in Computer Systems Design includes faculty from the Department of Information and Computer Science and the Depart\u00ad ment of Electrical and Computer Engineering in the School of Engineering who are interested in methodologies, tools, and designs of complex information and computer systems for scien\u00ad tific and environmental applications. Faculty and students are involved in a variety of projects in parallel processing, algorithms, software tools, parallel compilers, distributed computing, network\u00ad ing, real-time systems, VLSI architecture, computer-aided design, estimation, fault tolerant and highly reliable systems, software/hardware codesign, and design science. The goal of the IRU is to provide a broad spectrum of research opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students, to enhance interaction with distinguished scientists from both industry and universities from the United States and abroad, and to foster greater cooperation between the University and industry in solving related problems. GLOBAL PEACE AND CONFLICT STUDIES Although housed in the School of Social Sciences, participating faculty in the IRU in Global Peace and Conflict Studies are also drawn from the Schools of Humanities and Social Ecology, and from the natural sciences. The goals of the IRU are: (1) interdisci\u00ad plinary research on the international and domestic conditions nec\u00ad essary for the avoidance of war or civil strife, and the creation of a stable and fruitful peace; (2) education of graduate and undergrad\u00ad uate students about these conditions; (3) enhancement of interna\u00ad tional studies in general at UCI; and (4) dissemination of research and education in the community at large. Five interconnected themes characterize the cross-disciplinary research of the cooperating faculty: the interaction of foreign pol\u00ad icy making and domestic affairs, the strategy and ethics of arma\u00ad ment and disarmament, the role of international organizations in the creation of a more enduring peace, global ecological and envi\u00ad ronmental factors in peace and conflict, and the shaping of human attitudes and perceptions with respect to peace and conflict. HEALTH POLICY AND RESEARCH The IRU in Health Policy and Research fosters multidisciplinary studies on access to medical care and prevention among special populations. Faculty from the College of Medicine, the Schools of Social Sciences and Social Ecology, and the Graduate School of Management comprise the core group of investigators. The IRU's goals include conducting multidisciplinary research to address important questions related to access to medical care and prevention in special populations; exploring interventions and health policy options that will improve access to medical care and prevention in these groups; helping to guide policy makers in their decisions about health care initiatives for special populations; and facilitating the collaboration of faculty, students, and the profes\u00ad sional community through the expertise, facilities, and activities of the unit. \u00b7 Ongoing studies include: (1) evaluation of cancer-related knowl\u00ad edge, attitudes, and behaviors among Latino, American Samoan, and Vietnamese populations; (2) assessment of AIDS prevention strategies among Latinos; (3) investigation of injury prevention among children; and (4) exploration of access to medical care and the somatization disorder among Latino refugees. In support of research, the IRU sponsors health policy and research seminars during which faculty associates and guests discuss ongo\u00ad ing or planned research; guest lectureships conducted by nationally distinguished researchers and practitioners; and workshops on top\u00ad ics related to the unit's focus for faculty, students, government offi\u00ad cials, and community members. In addition, the IRU helps health policy researchers to develop and submit grant proposals and administers grants which have been funded. SOFTWARE Computer software development and maintenance is a major com\u00ad ponent of the county's, state's, and nation's economy. The IRU in Software (IRUS) is focused on enhancing abilities to design, pro\u00ad duce, assess, and maintain diverse types of software through a pro\u00ad gram of applied research and technology partnerships with indus\u00ad try. Technical emphases of IRUS include software processes and process improvement, user interface software technology, com\u00ad puter-supported cooperative work, analysis and testing, metrics and measurement, and software understanding. In support of these objectives IRUS sponsors monthly technical interchange meetings, which bring over 100 professionals from California industry to campus each month. One of these meetings is the Southern California Software Process Improvement Network (SPIN). Another meeting series is focused on software engineering tools and techniques. IRUS also sponsors several annual events, including a symposium on software technology, and focused, three\u00ad day technical research reviews. Information on IRUS and its regular activities can be obtained on the World Wide Web at http://www.ics.uci.edu/IRUS, or by tele\u00ad phone at (714) 824-2260. Focused Research Programs Focused Research Programs (FRP) are established for the purpose of developing and, for a limited period of time, sustaining interdis\u00ad ciplinary research that could not be carried out through individual effort or within a single academic unit. Because of the develop\u00ad mental nature of these programs, they ordinarily are approved for no more than three years and are supported partly by University funds. If a research program develops successfully, it may continue with extramural and/or University support. The following groups of faculty, students, and other researchers currently are recognized as Focused Research Programs. DEMOCRATIZATION The Democratization Focused Research Group is a collegium of scholars interested in the theoretical and practical issues of democ\u00ad ratization for politics, social relations, and everyday life. The research and educational activities of the program focus on three areas. First, one of the most important and exciting areas of con\u00ad temporary politics concerns the pressure for democratization in non-democratic societies in Eastern Europe, the Pacific Rim, and Latin America. The faculty are engaged in research and outreach activities that address the questions of the cultural and institutional foundations for successful democratic transitions in these nations. Second, the FRP considers democratization to be an ongoing process that raises new political challenges even for established democracies such as the United States and Western European nations. Most advanced industrialized nations confront similar problems to the United States in dealing with a changing economic structure, new forces of cultural change, and a reshaping of the cit\u00ad izen's relationship to government. The faculty are studying these contemporary political issues; this research can provide valuable new evidence on the character of the American political system as well as contribute to a richer understanding of the democratic process. The third research theme focuses on the expansion of democratiza\u00ad tion issues beyond the polity. Within the established democracies, there is new pressure for the democratization of social institutions. The faculty are studying the politicization of social relations and social life, and the expansion of democratization issues to the fam\u00ad ily and the workplace. UC IRVINE - 1996-1997In recognition of the extensive research and educational activities associated with the FRP, the National Science Foundation selected UCI in 1994 as a national center for the study of democratization and democratic politics. The NSF Graduate Research Training Pro\u00ad gram in Democratization and Democratic Politics provides a multi\u00ad year grant to train Ph.D. students in issues of empirical democratic theory, as it applies to newly democratizing nations and the expan\u00ad sion of democracY. in advanced industrial societies. The FRP is an interdisciplinary effort involving more than 30 polit\u00ad ical scientists, sociologists, economists, psychologists, and man\u00ad agement specialists at UCI and other universities throughout the world. Affiliate faculty include scholars from England, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, and Taiwan. ENVIRONMENTAL BIOTECHNOLOGY The Environmental Biotechnology Focused Research Group is composed of faculty from the Department of Microbiology and Molecular Genetics in the College of Medicine, the Departments of Civil and Environmental Engineering and of Chemical and Bio\u00ad chemical Engineering in the School of Engineering, and the Department of Environmental Analysis .and Design in the School of Social Ecology. Combining research expertise in environmental microbiology, environmental and biochemical engineering, and molecular genetics and virology, the faculty have identified two main multidisciplinary research areas: bioremediation and environ\u00ad mental diagnostics. UCI faculty research spans a variety 'of topics. Projects include: virus transport and fate in ground water recharged with sewer water using a genetically engineered Norwalk virus capsid without nucleic acid, and differentiation between human and animal waste in the environment using molecular probe and PCR; categorization of bacterial populations entering ground waters from wastewater recharge using RNA probes; the development of enhanced PCR techniques to detect hepatitis, Norwalk, and rotaviruses in aquatic environments and shellfish; and biofiltration techniques for removal and degradation of TCE. GRADUATE EDUCATION With the exception of programs conducted by the College of Medi\u00ad cine for the training of medical professionals, the Dean of Gradu\u00ad ate Studies administers graduate education in accordance with aca\u00ad demic policies established by the Academic Senate and by the Graduate Council, a standing committee of the Irvine Division of the Academic Senate. There is no separate graduate faculty at UCI; graduate work is supervised by academic units and faculties which have concurrent responsibility for undergraduate studies. Information about graduate education at UCI is published here in the UC/ General Catalogue and in individual graduate program publications. The staff of the Office of Research and Graduate Studies is prepared to answer questions about admission, academic policies and procedures, graduate programs and degrees, financial assistance, student services, and other matters of concern to appli\u00ad cants or graduate students. The Office is located in 120 Adminis\u00ad tration Building; telephone (714) 824-6761. Through the Graduate and Professional Opportunity Program (GPOP), steps are taken to increase the participation of tradition\u00ad ally underrepresented minorities (including women and Asian\u00ad Americans in designated fields) in the graduate academic and pro\u00ad fessional programs of the University. Appropriate assistance is offered during the admission process, and every effort is made through GPOP advisement and support to ensure that all students will have a reasonable chance to attain their academic objectives. Graduate Education 87 Admission to Graduate Standing Applicants for admission to graduate study at UCI must apply for acceptance into a specific graduate program to work toward an advanced degree. A general requirement for admission is that the applicant hold the degree of Bachelor of Arts, Letters, Philosophy, or Science (or an acceptable equivalent) from a recognized acade\u00ad mic institution. A grade point average of at least B (3.0 on a 4.0 scale) is required. Each applicant's file is evaluated by the admissions committee of the speeific graduate program on the basis of such factors as acad\u00ad emic subject preparation, scholarship, letters of recommendation, test scores, and examples of previous work. A critical question is whether the applicant's academic objectives can reasonably be sat\u00ad isfied by a graduate program on this campus. The University of California does not have the capacity to accommodate all appli\u00ad cants who meet the minimum admission requirements. Application Procedures HOW TO APPLY The Application for Graduate Admission must be completed either electronically or by using a paper application. The electronic appli\u00ad cation is available on the World Wide Web at http://www.rgs.uci. edu/grad/.

Payment instruc\u00ad tions are available in both the electronic and paper versions of the application. Application fee waivers are available for needy domestic students and targeted underrepresented minority and women applicants; students may be asked to provide verification of ethnicity. Detailed instructions for both the electronic and paper applications are included in their respective formats. For additional information or to obtain a paper application, call (714) 824-6761, or send e\u00ad mail to ogsfront@ccmail.rgs.uci.edu. WHEN TO APPLY For all graduate programs, applications should be completed by January 15 to receive full consideration for fellowship and assist\u00ad antship awards. Some academic units will accept applications for winter or spring quarter admission for which deadlines are October 15 and January 15, respectively. In order to process applications in time for the applicant to receive full consideration, letters of rec\u00ad ommendation, official transcripts, and test scores must be received before the published deadlines. Some schools and departments have earlier or later deadlines for filing the application. Applicants should consult their prospective department or school for informa\u00ad tion. Telephone numbers for the schools and departments may be obtained by calling (714) 824-6761. Required Supporting Documents LETTERS OF RECOMMENDATION Applicants should arrange to have three letters of recommendation forwarded directly to their prospective major department or pro\u00ad gram. Recommendation forms are enclosed in the application packet. Only one set of recommendation letters needs to be submit\u00ad ted in support of an application for admission and fellowship or assistantship consideration. It is important that letters of recom\u00ad mendation be completed by professors or instructors in disciplines related to the proposed course of study who are in a position to analyze an applicant's abilities and academic promise. UC IRVINE - 1996-199788 UCI 1996-97 Research and Graduate Studies GRADUATE RECORD EXAMINATION (GRE) SCORES All applicants are required to take the Graduate Record Examina\u00ad tion (GRE) General Test, with the following exceptions: (1) the Graduate School of Management requires that M.B.A. applicants take the Graduate Management Admission Test (GMAT), and (2) no standardized tests are required of those who seek the Master of Fine Arts degree or the Master of Arts in Teaching. There is no minimum GRE score. Several programs also require, or strongly recommend, that an applicant report the score of a GRE Subject Test. Applicants should register for either the October or December test dates to ensure the timely receipt of their score results for admission consideration. (A computerized version of the GRE is now offered Monday through Saturday at Sylvan Technology Learning Centers.) The standard written GREis administered five times a year in the United States and in 96 other countries. In addi\u00ad tion, several administrative service tests are given each year in major U.S. cities (dates vary). Applications for the GRE may be obtained from the Educational Testing Service, P.O. Box 6000, Princeton, NJ 08541-6000. \u00b7 ACADEMIC RECORDS Domestic applicants should request that official transcripts be for\u00ad warded directly to their prospective major department or program. Two complete sets of official records covering all postsecondary academic work attempted, regardless of length of attendance, are required. University of California transcripts must also be submit\u00ad ted by applicants, with the exception of those who are UCI under\u00ad graduates. Applicants with academic work in progress must expect to complete their undergraduate degree programs before the intended date of enrollment at UCI and must submit evidence of degree conferral before officially enrolling. FOREIGN ACADEMIC RECORDS Official records from overseas institutions should be sent directly to the prospective major department or program at UCI. Records of academic study from foreign institutions must be official, bearing the signature of the registrar and the seal of the issuing institution. Applicants should not send the original of an academic record which cannot be replaced; they should obtain instead properly cer\u00ad tified copies. Unless academic records and diplomas are issued in English by the institution, the official records in their original lan\u00ad guage must be submitted with an authorized, complete, and exact English translation. Foreign academic records must be in duplicate and include all subjects or courses taken on a yearly basis, together with the units of credit or time allotted to each subject each term or year and the marks or ratings in each subject or examination passed. In all cases the institutional grading scale or other standard of evaluation, including maximal passing and failing marks and definition of grades between them, should appear on official records or as an official attachment. Official evidence of degree conferral must also be supplied, together with evidence of rank in class if available. TEST OF ENGLISH AS A FOREIGN LANGUAGE (TOEFL) All applicants whose primary language is not English are required to submit the test results of the TOEFL. The TOEFL should be taken at the earliest available date to allow for scores to be reported in time to meet the application deadlines. A score of 550 or better is required for admission consideration. (The Graduate School of Management requires a minimum score of 570.) Arrangements for taking the TOEFL may be made through the nearest United States Embassy or by writing to the Educational Testing Service, P.O. Box 6151, Princeton, New Jersey 08541-6151, U.S.A. The TOEFL is given at UCI. TEST OF SPOKEN ENGLISH (TSE) All applicants whose primary language is not English and who wish to be considered for a Teaching Assistantship appointment must undergo and submit results for the Test of Spoken English (TSE). In order for a TA offer to be made, applicants must score above a certain minimum score. The TSE is given six times during the year at TOEFL test centers around the world. Information on taking the TSE may be obtained by writing to the Test of Spoken English, P.O. Box 6157, Princeton, New Jersey 08541-6157, U.S.A. The TSE is given at UCI. SPECIAL NOTE TO FOREIGN APPLICANTS Foreign applicants are required to certify that they possess suffi\u00ad cient funds to cover all fees, transportation, and living expenses for the first year of their studies at UCI. A Foreign Applicant Ques\u00ad tionnaire for the purpose of verifying the amount and source of funds available for graduate study will be forwarded to foreign applicants upon admission to graduate study. The required finan\u00ad cial verification must be provided before visa forms can be issued. Admission and Registration A formal notice of the admission decision is sent to each applicant as soon as possible after the application and complete records are received, and after the department has made a recommendation. The official notification will be mailed well in advance of the beginning of the quarter for which application has been made. Admission to graduate standing does not constitute registration for classes. A student is not officially registered for classes until the entire registration procedure is completed each quarter. Information on registration dates and procedures will be mailed to new appli\u00ad cants prior to the registration cycle. If any applicant wishes to defer admission to a later academic quarter, the Office of Research and Graduate Studies must be noti\u00ad fied in writing. After formal admission has been offered, a request for deferral must be approved by the academic unit. Limited Status University of California academic regulations provide for the admission of students to Limited Status for two purposes: (1) to prepare for admission to a graduate or professional program by enrolling for a prescribed set of courses; or (2) to pursue a specific academic program which does not lead to a graduate degree. The general requirements for admission to Limited Status are the same as those for graduate admission, with the exception that Graduate Record Examination scores are not required. Admission to Limited Status is ordinarily for a period of three quarters (one academic year) and does not imply admission to a UCI graduate degree pro\u00ad gram at some later date. Although Limited Status does not represent graduate standing, admission is offered by the Dean of Graduate Studies upon the rec\u00ad ommendation of an academic unit which has agreed to oversee the student's program. Graduate courses taken while in Limited Status ordinarily qualify for transfer credit toward advanced degree requirements, but will not satisfy minimum degree or residency requirements for any UC graduate program to which the student eventually might be admitted. Academic Advising In each academic unit with an advanced degree program, there is at least one formally appointed graduate advisor or director of gradu\u00ad ate studies. The graduate advisor is a regular faculty member responsible for supervising graduate study in that unit, for monitor\u00ad ing the academic progress of graduate students, and for seeing that each graduate student is assigned a faculty advisor. The graduate UC IRVINE - 1996-1997advisor plays a key role in the academic lives of graduate students, advising students and other faculty members about program requirements and the academic policies of the Office of Research and Graduate Studies, approving study lists, and evaluating acade\u00ad mic petitions. In many academic units the graduate advisor is instrumental in the nomination of students for fellowship support, the selection of students for assistantship and fellowship appoint\u00ad ments, and in the supervision of graduate student teachers. In most schools there also is an associate dean for graduate studies who coordinates many of the functions which affect graduate students within that school. Both graduate advisors and deans are important links between the student and the Dean of Graduate Studies. Most graduate students also will have an individual faculty advisor or advising committee, especially after the first year of advanced study. When a student is advanced to candidacy for the Ph.D., the doctoral committee becomes the primary source of academic guid\u00ad ance; however, student academic petitions still must be approved by the Graduate Advisor. Academic Policies The academic policies described here apply to students enrolled in study leading to graduate degrees and California education creden\u00ad tials. Other regulations and procedures of importance to graduate students are covered in the Academic Regulations and Enrollment and Other Procedures sections, and in the description of each grad\u00ad uate program. SCHOLASTIC REQUIREMENTS A graduate student is expected to make satisfactory progress toward an approved academic objective, as defined by the faculty of the program in accordance with policies of the Graduate Coun\u00ad cil, and to maintain a satisfactory grade point average for all work undertaken while enrolled in graduate study. Satisfactory progress is determined on the basis of both the recent academic record and overall performance. A graduate student normally is expected to complete satisfactorily at least eight units of academic credit applicable to the graduate program in each regular academic ses\u00ad sion (unless on an approved leave of absence), and satisfy all requirements of the academic program according to an approved schedule. For a graduate student, only the grades A+, A, A-, B+, B, and S represent satisfactory scholarship and may be applied toward advanced degree requirements. However, upon petition, a UCI course in which a grade of B-is earned may be accepted in partial satisfaction of the degree requirements if the student has a grade point average of at least 3.0 in all courses applicable to the degree. Graduate students may not apply courses graded Pass or Not Pass toward any degree or satisfactory progress requirements. A grade point average below the B level (3.0 on a 4.0 scale) is not satisfac\u00ad tory, and a student whose grade point average is below that level is subject to academic disqualification. A student's academic progress ordinarily is evaluated on the basis of the academic record. A few weeks after the end of a quarter, an updated copy of each enrolled student's permanent academic record is available from the Registrar. This record lists all UCI courses for which a graduate student was enrolled (including courses taken through the Intercampus Exchange Program), the grades assigned, and the cumulative grade point average. Formal candidacy for an advanced degree, degrees conferred, certain examinations passed, unit credit accepted from other institutions, and other important academic information is recorded also. A graduate student who has not demonstrated satisfactory progress is not eligible for any academic appointment such as Reader, Grad\u00ad uate Student Researcher, or Teaching Assistant, and may not hold a fellowship or other award which is based upon academic merit. Graduate Education 89 GRADING With the consent of the academic units involved, individual study and research courses at the graduate level may be graded Satisfac\u00ad tory or Unsatisfactory (Stu). With the approval of the Graduate Council certain graduate courses are graded Stu only. A grade of S is equivalent to a grade of B (3.0) or better. No credit is given for a course in which a grade of U was assigned. Graduate students may take one course (up to four units) per quarter on a Pass/Not Pass basis. However, such courses are not considered part of the student's graduate program and may not be applied toward the requirements for an advanced degree. The grade of Incomplete (I) may be assigned by an instructor when the student's work is of passing quality but is incomplete because of circumstances beyond the student's control. Although Incom\u00ad plete grades do not affect a graduate student's grade point average, they are an important factor in evaluating academic progress. The maximum amount of time that an instructor may allow for making up incomplete work is three quarters of enrollment but stricter lim\u00ad its may be applied. When work is completed within the time allowed, the student should ask the instructor to submit a change\u00ad of-grade notice to the Registrar, ordinarily through the dean of the school in which the course was offered. If not made up within the time allowed, an I grade is recorded permanently. IP (In Progress) is a transcript notation restricted to sequential courses extending over two or more quarters for which use of the IP notation has been approved. When the last quarter of the sequence is completed, the grade for the final quarter is assigned for all quarters of the sequence. No credit is given until the student has completed the entire sequence. A student who received an NR (No Report) transcript notation must immediately contact the instructor and arrange for the removal or replacement of the NR. After one quarter, an NR becomes an F or NP which will remain permanently upon the stu\u00ad dent's record. A graduate student may repeat once a course in which a grade below B (3.0) or a grade of U was received. Only the most recently earned grade is used in computing the student's grade point aver\u00ad age for the first eight units of repeated work; thereafter both the earlier and the later grades are used. Additional information about grading may be found in the Acade\u00ad mic Regulations section. ACADEMIC DISQUALIFICATION After consultation with the student's academic unit, the Dean of Graduate Studies may disqualify a student who has a grade point average in graduate and upper-division courses below 3.0 for two or more successive quarters; or fails to pass (or does not take) a required examination within the time specified for that graduate program; or does not maintain satisfactory academic progress toward completion of an approved program of study. Unsatisfactory academic progress may be determined on the basis of explicit requirements, but the professional judgment of the fac\u00ad ulty upon review of all graduate work undertaken by the student is paramount. Ordinarily, a student whose work does not meet acade\u00ad mic standards will be given written notice and a reasonable period of time in which to make up all deficiencies. Prior to taking final action to disqualify, the Dean of Graduate Studies ordinarily will notify a student who is subject to academic disqualification and will provide reasonable opportunity for the student to correct erroneous or outdated academic records, to sub\u00ad mit other information or comments in writing, or to request a sec\u00ad ond review of his or her academic performance. Upon written notice of academic disqualification by the Dean of Graduate Studies, disqualification will be noted on the formal academic UC IRVINE - 1996-199790 UCI 1996-97 Research and Graduate Studies record of that student. Following the formal notice of disqualifica\u00ad tion, the student may appeal to the Dean of Graduate Studies only on the basis of procedural error. ACADEMIC RESIDENCE A graduate student is considered to be in residence during an acad\u00ad emic quarter if at least four units of academic credit are earned in regular upper-division or graduate courses. Credit for one acade\u00ad mic quarter of residence may be earned by completing at least two units of credit in approved courses in each of two six-week sum\u00ad mer sessions, or four units of credit in an eight-or ten-week sum\u00ad mer session. In the case of Ph.D. students, these must be consecu\u00ad tive sessions. ENROLLMENT POLICY Full-time academic enrollment is expected of graduate students at the University of California. Study for the Ph.D. requires a full\u00ad time commitment from the doctoral student. Full-time study is defined as enrollment in at least 12 units of upper-division or grad\u00ad uate academic credit per quarter, including credit for supervised research or teaching. Graduate students may enroll in lower-divi\u00ad sion courses with the approval of their academic advisors, but such courses are not considered to be part of any graduate program. Graduate students ordinarily may not receive credit for more than 12 units per quarter in graduate courses, or 16 units in upper-divi\u00ad sion courses, or a proportionate number in combination. Course loads in excess of 16 units must be approved in advance by the student's Graduate Advisor and the Dean of Graduate Studies. Although in most instances completion of an advanced degree at UCI requires full-time study, the University recognizes the legiti\u00ad mate need for part-time study opportunities and is committed to providing those opportunities wherever possible. Graduate degree programs may be opened to part-time students wherever good edu\u00ad cational reasons exist for so doing. In general, part-time status is available in master's and credential programs where part-time study has been judged academically feasible by faculty and approved by the Graduate Council. Under this policy, part-time enrollment at the graduate level is defined as enrollment for eight units or less. Within the guidelines and limitations on the applica\u00ad tion form available in the Office of Research and Graduate Studies, graduate students may petition for part-time status and, if the peti\u00ad tion is approved, shall pay the full University Registration Fee and student activities fees, one-half the Educational Fee, and one-half the Nonresident Tuition Fee (if applicable). CONTINUOUS REGISTRATION A graduate student is expected to enroll for each regular academic session (fall, winter, and spring quarters) until all requirements for an advanced degree or credential have been completed, including final examinations and the submission of an approved thesis or dis\u00ad sertation. Enrollment is not official until all required fees have been paid and the student has enrolled in classes. Students are responsible for ensuring that their course enrollment is correct. For more information, see the Enrollment and Other Procedures section. A student engaged in study or research outside the State of Califor\u00ad nia for an entire quarter ordinarily will register in absentia. Unless an official leave of absence has been granted, or a petition to pay the Filing Fee in lieu of registration has been approved by the Dean of Graduate Studies, a student who does not register by the final deadline for any regular quarter will lose graduate standing, and candidacy for any advanced degree will lapse. Prior to resum\u00ad ing graduate study in the University, a former student must suc\u00ad cessfully apply for readmission. A readmitted student must register and then be advanced or reinstated to candidacy at least one quar\u00ad ter before receiving an advanced degree. A degree cannot be con\u00ad ferred earlier than the second quarter following readmission. A graduate student who decides to leave the University after enrolling and paying fees for a quarter must file an official Notice of Withdrawal or Cancellation with the Dean of Graduate Studies. A graduate student in good academic standing who withdraws from graduate study and intends to return within one year may submit an application for a leave of absence. If the leave is approved, the stu\u00ad dent remains in good standing and need not apply for readmission in order to enroll at the expiration of the leave period. LEAVE OF ABSENCE A graduate student who withdraws from the University with the intention of returning within one year and wishes to avoid a lapse of student status should request a leave of absence. A leave of absence of up to one year's duration may be granted by the Dean of Graduate Studies upon the recommendation of the student's aca\u00ad demic unit, subject to the following guidelines: 1. The student must have completed satisfactorily at least one quarter in residence and be in good academic standing. The leave must be consistent with the student's academic objectives. 2. Leave ordinarily is approved in cases of serious illness or other temporary disability, or temporary interruption of the student's academic program for other appropriate reasons. 3. A student on leave is not eligible for assistance from a Univer\u00ad sity fellowship, research grant, or financial aid program, and may not hold an academic appointment or comparable Univer\u00ad sity employment. During a period of leave, a student may not take comprehensive or qualifying examinations or earn acade\u00ad mic credit (except by a transfer of credit from another institution approved in advance by the Dean of Graduate Studies). Univer\u00ad sity resources and facilities, including housing, are ordinarily unavailable to students on leave. 4. A student failing to register for the next regular academic ses\u00ad sion following the expiration of leave will lose graduate stand\u00ad ing and will be subject to the following readmission policy. READMISSION A student who previously withdrew from the University, or whose student status has lapsed, may request readmission to graduate study by submitting an Application for Admission with a $40 fee, which is nonrefundable. The Dean of Graduate Studies may grant readmission when recommended by the academic unit. If readmit\u00ad ted, a student's previous academic work will be applied toward the requirements for an advanced degree only with the approval of the graduate advisor and the Dean of Graduate Studies. A readmitted student must satisfy the academic requirements in effect at the time of readmission and may be required to satisfy certain requirements a second time, including those for formal advancement to candi\u00ad dacy. A readmitted student must register and then be advanced or reinstated to candidacy at least one quarter before receiving an advanced degree, which will be conferred no earlier than the sec\u00ad ond quarter following readmission. INTERCAMPUS EXCHANGE PROGRAM A graduate student in good standing who wishes to take advantage of educational opportunities available only at another campus of the University of California may do so through the Intercampus Exchange Program. Ordinarily, an exchange student will have demonstrated a high level of scholarship during at least one quarter of graduate study at the home campus and will have well-defined academic objectives. Approval of the faculty advisor, the host department(s), and the respective deans of graduate studies is required. Direct arrangements between faculty members on the two campuses are encouraged so as to ensure that courses, seminars, or facilities will be available to meet the participating student's needs. Students may take courses on more than one campus of the Uni\u00ad versity in the same academic session. UC IRVINE - 1996-1997The exchange student enrolls and pays fees on the home campus and then enrolls at the host campus, following the procedures of that Registrar's Office. A report of academic work completed will be transferred to the student's academic record on the home campus. Although eligible for all normal student services, the exchange stu\u00ad dent is a visitor and is not formally admitted to graduate study at the host campus. Application forms for the Intercampus Exchange Program may be obtained from the Office of Research and Graduate Studies and should be filed with the Office at least four weeks before the beginning of the quarter in order to avoid penalties. TRANSFERS OF CREDIT At least one-half of the course requirement for a master's degree must be completed while in residence as a graduate student at UCI. Credit for up to one-fifth of the minimum number of units required for a master's degree may be allowed for graduate-level work com\u00ad pleted at another institution or through University Extension prior to first graduate enrollment at UCI. Such courses do not count toward the required number of units in 200-series courses. Up to one-half the units required may be accepted from another graduate division of the University of California. After enrollment, the stu\u00ad dent must initiate a formal petition for such credit. The acceptance of unit credit earned in another program must be recommended by the academic unit to which the student has been admitted and be approved by the Dean of Graduate Studies. No units of transfer credit will be given for any course in which a grade below B (3.0) or equivalent was assigned. Under no circumstances will grade credit be transferred. A student currently enrolled in a master's degree program or on a leave of absence may receive unit credit (not grade credit) for graduate-level work completed at another institution or through University Extension only with the prior approval of the depart\u00ad mental graduate advisor and the Dean of Graduate Studies. No transfer credit will be given for any course in which a grade below B or equivalent was assigned. A student who begins graduate study at UCI in the fall quarter will receive appropriate credit for courses taken in preceding UCI summer sessions, provided that the formal date of admission pre\u00ad cedes summer session enrollment. Continuing graduate students will receive credit for courses taken in intervening UCI summer sessions. Graduate Degrees MASTER'S DEGREES The master's degree is conferred at the end of the academic quarter . in which all requirements have been satisfied, subject to the final approval of the Graduate Council. The student must be advanced to candidacy for the degree prior to the beginning of the final quar\u00ad ter of enrollment. Therefore, an application for advancement to candidacy, initiated by the student and approved by the academic unit, should be submitted to the Dean of Graduate Studies at least 30 days before the opening of the quarter in which the degree is expected. The Master of Arts (M.A.) or Master of Science (M.S.) degree nor\u00ad mally is attained by one of two routes: Plan I, a thesis; or Plan II, a comprehensive examination. Both require a minimum \u00b7Of one year in residence, satisfactory completion of prescribed course work, and an appropriate demonstration of achievement. Plan I includes a minimum of seven courses (28 units), 20 units or more of which must be at the graduate level; a thesis; and a general examination. Plan II requires at least nine courses (36 units), including 24 units or more at the graduate level, and a comprehensive examination covering a broad range of subject matter in the discipline: Only approved 200-series courses completed while in residence at the University satisfy the minimum graduate course requirement. Graduate Education 91 Some programs will have course requirements exceeding the mini\u00ad mums cited above and may have additional or alternative degree requirements. Please refer to the description of the specific pro\u00ad gram for more information. Master of Fine Arts (M.F.A.) degrees are awarded by the School of the Arts (M.F.A. in Dance, Drama, Music, or Studio Art) ) and by the Program in Writing (M.F.A. in English) upon successful com\u00ad pletion of the equivalent of two years or more of full-time study with an emphasis upon creative expression and professional devel\u00ad opment. Special thesis or comprehensive examination requirements are established for these programs. \u00b7 Master of Arts in Teaching (M.A.T.) degrees are awarded upon successful completion of programs designed for the professional development of secondary school teachers and college instructors. A minimum of one year in residence is required, usually including summer session course work. A thesis project or other comparable evidence of professional attainment is part of each M.A.T. program. Master of Business Administration (M.B.A.) degrees are awarded by the Graduate School of Management upon successful comple\u00ad tion of the equivalent of two years of full-time study in the devel\u00ad opment of professional managerial skills. Master of Urban and Regional Planning (M.U.R.P.) degrees are awarded by the School of Social Ecology upon successful comple\u00ad tion of the equivalent of two years of full-time study in contempo\u00ad rary methods of planning and policy analysis. DOCTOR OF PHILOSOPHY DEGREE The Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) degree is awarded on the basis of evidence that the recipient possesses knowledge of a broad field of learning and expert mastery of a particular area of concentration within it. The research dissertation is expected to demonstrate criti\u00ad cal judgment, intellectual synthesis, creativity, and skill in written communication. The candidate for the Ph.D. is expected to be in full-time residence for at least six regular academic quarters. Four to six years of full\u00ad time academic work beyond the bachelor's degree typically is required to complete the degree. At the end of the first year or so of full-time study, many programs administer a preliminary exami\u00ad nation on the student's mastery of fundamental knowledge in the discipline. Upon successfully demonstrating a high level of schol\u00ad arship on this examination and after further study, the student will continue to a series of qualifying examinations which lead to for\u00ad mal advancement to candidacy for the Ph.D. Graduate students ordinarily attain candidacy status for the Ph.D. degree when all preparatory work has been completed, when quali\u00ad fying examinations have been passed, and when they are ready for the dissertation phase. Students are recommended for advancement to candidacy by unanimous vote of the candidacy committee appointed by the academic unit on behalf of the Graduate Council. The Report on Qualifying Examination for the Degree of Doctor of Philosophy (Form I) must be signed by the committee at the time the candidacy examination is concluded and submitted to the Dean of Graduate Studies. Following a unanimous favorable vote of the committee, the student will be advanced to candidacy upon pay\u00ad ment of the $50 Candidacy Fee. Candidacy for the Ph.D. will lapse automatically if the student loses graduate standing by academic disqualification or failure to comply with the University policy on continuous registration. A readmitted student who was a candidate for the Ph.D. must again advance to candidacy and thereafter enroll as a candidate for at least one academic quarter before the Ph.D. may be conferred. Following advancement to candidacy for the Ph.D., a doctoral committee appointed by the academic unit chair (on behalf of the Dean of Graduate Studies and the Graduate Council) supervises the student's program, approves the dissertation, and conducts the final UC IRVINE - 1996-199792 UCI 1996-97 Research and Graduate Studies oral examination if required. The chair of the doctoral committee is the member of the faculty responsible for providing primary guid\u00ad ance of the student's dissertation. Ordinarily, the final examination will be given just prior to completion of the dissertation and while the student is in residence during a regular academic session, and will be open to all members of the academic community. Ph.D. degrees are conferred, subject to the final approval of the Graduate Council, as of the last day of the regular academic quarter in which all requirements have been satisfied. DOCTOR OF EDUCATION DEGREE The Doctor of Education (Ed.D.) is awarded by UCI in conjunction with the School of Education at the University of California, Los Angeles. Refer to the Department of Education section of this Cat\u00ad alogue for more information. THESES AND DISSERTATIONS Candidates for the Ph.D., Ed.D., and certain master's degrees must conduct an extensive research project and submit a dissertation or thesis in order to fulfill degree requirements. Research expenses are not supported by the University, and the cost of preparing the dissertation or thesis ordinarily ranges from $200 to $1,000, but may be considerably more. After approval by the doctoral or thesis committee appointed for each candidate by the academic unit, on behalf of the Graduate Council, two copies of the dissertation or thesis must be filed for placement in the UCI Library. The final copy must meet the Uni\u00ad versity's requirements for style, format, and appearance before the degree can be conferred. A thesis and dissertation manuscript preparation manual is available for sale in the UCI Bookstore, in the Library for photocopying, and on the World Wide Web at gopher:/ /uniedit.cwis. uci.edu:7026/ll I grad. Dissertations and theses must be filed by the deadline published in the quarterly Schedule of Classes in order for them to be reviewed and accepted in time for the degree to be conferred in that quarter. Those students who complete requirements and submit theses/dis\u00ad sertations after the end of the tenth week of classes and prior to the start of the subsequent quarter will earn a degree for the following quarter, but will not be required to pay fees for that quarter. Please note that in order to avoid payment of fees, manuscripts, all forms, and degree paperwork must be submitted prior to the first day of the quarter in which the degree is to be earned. THE FILING FEE Under certain circumstances, a student who has advanced to candi\u00ad dacy for a graduate degree may be eligible to pay a Filing Fee equal to half of the Registration Fee in lieu of registration, subject to the approval of the Dean of Graduate Studies. In general, all requirements for a degree must have been satisfied prior to the start of the quarter, except for the submission of the final version of the dissertation or thesis, or the completion of a final oral or comprehensive examination. The student who intends to make use of any University resource, to hold any academic appointment or comparable University employment, or to receive any student ser\u00ad vice for which official registration and payment of regular fees is a requirement is not eligible to pay the Filing Fee in lieu of registra\u00ad tion. A Filing Fee will not be accepted immediately following read\u00ad mission and will be accepted immediately following a leave of absence only under exceptional circumstances. The date for pay\u00ad ment of the Filing Fee is the same as that for the payment of other student fees. If all degree requirements are not completed during the quarter in which the Filing Fee is paid, the student must subse\u00ad quently register and pay all applicable fees. CONFERRAL OF GRADUATE DEGREES Prior to the beginning of the quarter in which an advanced degree is to be conferred, the student must have advanced to candidacy for that degree and should have received formal notice confirming candidacy from the Dean of Graduate Studies. The student should consult the departmental graduate advisor to determine which degree requirements, if any, have not yet been satisfied. Students are advised by mail when their diplomas are available, which is approximately six months after the quarter in which the degrees are awarded. Financial Assistance for Graduate Students Several types of financial assistance are available to graduate stu\u00ad dents at UCI. These include fellowships, teaching and research assistantships, tuition fellowships for nonresident students, grants\u00ad in-aid, student loans, and work-study. All graduate students are encouraged to submit a financial aid application each year to access state and federal grants and loans. The Free Application for Federal Student Aid is available in the Office of Graduate Studies and the Financial Aid Office after Janu\u00ad ary l, with a deadline of March 2 each year. The Financial Aid sec\u00ad tion in this Catalogue and the Financial Aid at UCI handbook, available from the Financial Aid Office, contain information about assistance based upon financial need that is administered by the Financial Aid Office. Applicants interested in assistantships or fellowships should so indicate on their application when applying for admission. For all graduate programs, applications should be completed by January 15 to receive full consideration for fellowship and assistantship awards. Continuing students interested in an assistantship or fel\u00ad Jowship should contact the Graduate Advisor for their program. The awarding of fellowships for the following academic year begins in the winter quarter. UCI subscribes to the agreement of the Council of Graduate Schools of the United States, under which successful applicants for awards of financial support are given until April 15 to accept or decline such awards. An award accepted from one of the member universi\u00ad ties may be resigned at any time through April 15. However, an acceptance given or left in force after that date commits the student to not accepting another appointment without first obtaining formal release for that purpose from the awarding institution. Regents', UCI Chancellor's Fellowships, to a number of promising students entering graduate study at UCI leading to the Doctor of Philoso\u00ad phy, Doctor of Education, or Master of Fine Arts degree. Awards may include a stipend, all required student fees, and, if applicable, Nonresident Tuition. Other fellowships are offered, including tuition awards for outstanding applicants who are not residents of California. In many cases, fellowship stipends may be supple\u00ad mented by partial assistantship appointments. Entering or continuing graduate students may be awarded research or teaching assistantships for all or part of the academic year. The types of assistantships, number available, and required duties vary according to the activities of the academic unit. A graduate assis\u00ad tant who is not a California resident also may receive a tuition fellowship. Through the Graduate and Professional Opportunity Program, a number of fellowships and assistantships are awarded to entering and continuing graduate students from groups including targeted minorities and women in certain fields who traditionally have been underrepresented in higher education in the United States. All fel\u00ad lowship awards and assistantships appointments are made in accor\u00ad dance with the affirmative action policies of the University.

The School consists of the Departments of Dance, Drama, Music, and Studio Art, and the program in Arts Interdisciplinary. Both undergraduate and graduate degree programs are offered and include extensive studio, workshop, and performing experiences, theoretical and historical studies, and work in criticism. All of the School's departments are located in the Arts Village, facilitating daily interaction among student and faculty in all Arts disciplines. The Village includes studio and classroom facilities, four theatres, a concert hall, the University Art Gallery, the Visual Resources Collection, the Gassman Electronic Studio, the Music Media Center, the Arts Computing Laboratory, and a television stu\u00ad dio. Professionally managed and staffed theatrical production shops and publicity and box offices supporting the School's exten\u00ad sive production and performance schedule also are located in the Village. Arts students regularly participate in choirs, instrumental ensem\u00ad bles, drama and dance productions, and art exhibitions. Qualified students from other academic areas also are eligible to participate in many of these activities and are encouraged to do so. Many of the School's productions take place in the Irvine Barclay Theatre, a fully equipped, 750-seat performing facility. In addition to the artists, scholars, and performers who are mem\u00ad bers of the Arts faculty, visits by distinguished guest artists/teach\u00ad ers are a feature of the School's activities. Students receive assistance with program planning and a variety of other support services from the professional staff in the Office of the Arts Student Affairs. The staff also assists the faculty in provid\u00ad ing academic counseling to Arts students. DEGREES Dance ........................................................... B.A., B.F.A., M.F.A.

Departmental Requirements: Refer to individual departments. Graduate Program The primary endeavor of the School of the Arts is the creative act. Research activities are pursued both as an end in themselves and as a source that can inform both performance and the studio experi\u00ad ence. The intellectual activity of theoretical, literary, and historical courses complements the practical work in studio workshops and performance. The aim of the M.F.A. programs in Dance, Drama, Music, and Studio Art is, thus, to produce literate artists who are responsive to intellectual stimuli, disciplined, and capable of inte\u00ad grating existing knowledge into creative projects. It is the strong belief of the School that intellectual integrity and creative excel\u00ad lence cannot exist without each other. ADMISSION TO THE PROGRAM Applications are accepted for fall quarter admission only, and ordi\u00ad narily must be completed by March 1 for all the Master of Fine Arts degrees, as the number of graduate students that can be admit\u00ad ted to the School of the Arts is limited. Applicants are advised to arrange for auditions, interviews, and the submission of portfolios, compositions, and dossiers, as appropriate, by March 1. Students applying for scholarships and fellowships should do so by January Arts Interdisciplinary 95 15, and are also encouraged to apply for financial assistance through the Financial Aid Office. The School of the Arts has a modest number of teaching assistantships available in all areas, and all candidates are automatically reviewed for teaching assistantship positions; the School informs successful candidates by June 1 for the following academic year. Upon admission to the program the student is assigned an advisor. The student should discuss with this advisor the scope of under\u00ad graduate preparation to determine any areas which may need strengthening if full benefit from graduate study is to be derived. Arts Interdisciplinary 101 Mesa Arts Building; (714) 824-6646 Stephen Barker, Director Faculty Stephen Barker, Ph.D. University of Arizona, Associate Dean of the School of the Arts, Director of Arts Interdisciplinary, Department Chair (Acting) of Studio Art, and Associate Professor of Drama The program in Arts Interdisciplinary is designed for students who wish to investigate the various disciplines in and beyond the arts. Although participation in studio classes is required, the program emphasizes the study of the history, theory, and criticism of the arts in the School's various departments and their relations to other disciplines. The nature of the program provides each student the opportunity to plan a uniquely individual course of study with the approval of the Director or an appropriate advisor. Because the Arts Interdisciplinary program is designed for students with a strong sense of personal direction and a desire for an academic appreciation of the arts, students wishing to enter the program must submit a statement of purpose to the Director prior to the quarter in which they intend to declare their major. Admission to the program is based upon the statement of purpose and upon the student's prior record of high academic performance. Upon completion of this program, students will be awarded the B.A. in Fine Arts with Arts Interdisciplinary as the area of concentration. The University's Education Abroad Program offers students the opportunity to study abroad. European study centers of particular interest to the Arts Interdisciplinary major which are strong in the history, theory, and criticism of the arts are located in Vienna, Aus\u00ad tria (music, art), Copenhagen, Denmark (medieval studies), Paris, France (French critical thought and film criticism), Gottingen, Ger\u00ad many (music, archaeology), and Bologna, Italy (music, art, drama). Arts courses also are part of the general curriculum in other study centers in France, Hungary, Spain, Israel, and Sweden, in addition to arts courses in English-language study centers in the United Kingdom, Ireland, Australia, New Zealand, Ghana, Egypt, and India.

Eastman School of Music, Assistant Professor of Dance (musical resources, music for dancers, dance accompaniment, com\u00ad position) The Department of Dance fosters an educational environment in which performance opportunities, creative projects, and theoretical studies complement and reinforce each other and provide a founda\u00ad tion for careers in dance. The program focuses on studio experi\u00ad ence in the techniques of classical ballet, modem dance, jazz, tap, and selected ethnic dance forms. Theoretical studies include his\u00ad tory; philosophy, aesthetics, and criticism; Laban studies; dance training methods; and dance science. The objective of studio work is to develop kinesthetic resources, precision, flexibility, creativity, and freedom in a coordinated and intelligently responsive dancer. The techniques of classical ballet, modem dance, and jazz constitute crafts and styles for the dancer that serve not only as a basis for the training of the body, but also as a basic language of movement for the choreographer. The theoretical, historical, and scientific courses are designed both to broaden the perspective of those students whose first interest is performance or choreography, and to provide a foundation for those students who plan to pursue careers in the academic, scien\u00ad tific, or administrative fields of dance. The dance archives in the UCI Library Special Collections offer a rich source of research materials which enhance the Dance pro\u00ad gram. Among other special holdings, the archives include the extensive Ruth Clark Lert collection of dance books, journals, pho\u00ad tographs, original costume sketches, and memorabilia of dance in Europe and the United States from pre-World War I to the present. CAREERS FOR THE DANCE MAJOR Careers in dance require excellent training and extraordinary disci\u00ad pline, tenacity, and dedication. Graduates of the Department have an excellent record of placement in the many fields of dance. Some have become professional dancers in ballet companies (including the San Francisco, Frankfurt, and Stuttgart Ballets); in modem dance companies (including the Bella Lewitzky, Lar Lubovitch, Garth Fagan, and Bat-Dor Companies); in musicals (including Jerome Robbins' Broadway, and the original cast of Chorus Line); and in films, television, and theatre. In addition to training for professional dance performance and choreography, the major in dance serves as a basis for graduate study or job opportunities in fields such as dance history, dance sci\u00ad ence, dance pedagogy, dance reconstruction, dance criticism, and dance video. Related fields, such as arts administration, law in rela\u00ad tion to the arts, arts therapies, design and production, and music also offer positions for graduates. Students who are interested in a career in physical therapy or dance science will find a major in UC IRVINE - 1996-1997Dance, with related course work in chemistry, physics, biology, and mathematics, to be excellent preparation for further study. THE UNDERGRADUATE PROGRAM The Bachelor of Arts (B.A.) is designed for those who wish to obtain a broad undergraduate background as preparation for careers or graduate work and related fields. It offers students a dance edu\u00ad cation that stresses performance and choreography, and, at the same time, intellectual depth and scope. In addition to the core, 12 units of elective Dance courses are required. The remaining elective units required for graduation may be chosen from Dance or other disciplines in relation to a student's individual interest. While the program of study in Dance stresses technical proficiency and acad\u00ad emic understanding in dance, the B.A. clegree program also enables students to pursue elective subjects in their special areas of interest in other academic disciplines. The Bachelor of Fine Arts (B.F.A.) degree program with special\u00ad izations in Performance and Choreography, is designed for students who wish to prepare intensively for careers in those areas. The courses required in addition to the core are primarily in Dance. The B.F.A. program allows for a few free electives in other areas. Admission to the B.F.A. program is by faculty approval only. Proficiency Levels In addition to meeting the general requirements for admission to UCI, applicants must demonstrate technicaVcreative promise. The Department holds annual entrance auditions for potential freshmen and transfer students during winter quarter prior to the fall quarter when entrance is anticipated. First-year students wishing to major in Dance must be at technique level II in at least one of the three major genres (ballet, modem, jazz). Placement auditions for admitted students are held during Welcome Week to determine levels of technical ability for placement in courses. Transfer students wishing to pursue a B.A. degree in Dance should have completed, in addition to their breadth requirements, one course in choreography/improvisation, one course in technique analysis/injury prevention, and one course in musicianship. Previously admitted majors who wish to obtain a B.F.A. degree with a specialization in Performance or Choreography must apply in writ\u00ad ing at the end of the second quarter of their sophomore year. An additional audition is required for acceptance into the B.F.A. pro\u00ad gram. Once accepted, students must pass yearly evaluations to con\u00ad tinue in the program. Transfer students wishing to pursue the B.F.A. degree must declare their intention in writing at the time of their entrance audition and demonstrate technique levels appropri\u00ad ate to their year. Transfer students should have completed, in addi\u00ad tion to their breadth requirements, one year of choreography, one course in technique analysis/injury prevention, and one course in musicianship. Students deficient in level of performance or academic preparation should be prepared to extend their studies beyond the normal four\u00ad year program in order to meet the requirements for graduation.

California State University Long Beach, Lecturer in Drama (costume design) The program leading to the Bachelor of Arts in Drama combines broad liberal study and comprehensive training in several subdisci\u00ad plines of drama. Each Drama major studies and practices in each of several mutually related areas of the theatre: performance, liter\u00ad ature, history, criticism, design and stage management, and produc\u00ad tion. The curriculum is structured to relate studio practices, techni\u00ad cal resources, and production techniques to the development of dramatic literature and current critical theory. The program is designed for students who, while not necessarily planning to make the theatre their vocation, have a serious interest in the literature, theory, and practice of drama, as well as for stu\u00ad dents preparing to work professionally in the theatre, often after more specialized training at the graduate level. CAREERS FOR THE DRAMA MAJOR A degree in Drama may or may not lead to professional employ\u00ad ment in theatre or film. Graduates in Drama at UCI have performed in Broadway plays, regional and summer theatres, and in films and television. They serve as artistic directors, designers, art directors, business man\u00ad agers, and performers at more than 100 theatre companies, and as faculty at more than 75 institutions of higher learning. Not all Drama students become professional theatre artists. Many embark upon careers in law, business, arts management, advertis\u00ad ing, and teaching; others pursue further study at UCI or elsewhere.

UC IRVINE - 1996-1997I 1 06 UCI 1996-97 School of the Arts PROGRAMS OF STUDY The Department of Music offers two undergraduate degrees (the Bachelor of Arts in Music and the Bachelor of Music) and the Master of Fine Arts degree in Music. The minor in Music is unavailable until further notice. The Bachelor of Music (B.Mus.) degree program is performance\u00ad oriented. It offers students the opportunity to specialize in one of the following: bassoon, clarinet, contrabass, flute, French hom, harp, lute and guitar, oboe, percussion, piano, saxophone, trom\u00ad viola, appears on the student's UCI transcript.) In addition, B.Mus. students may qualify for the Special String Performance option, an intensified curriculum for professional-level students. All B.Mus. students receive continuous private instruction, for a maximum of 12 quarters, and present a solo recital during their senior year. B.Mus. students participate in performance classes each quarter. Vocal performance students focus on diction, move\u00ad ment, stage presentation, repertory, criticism, and style. Guitar and lute students focus on ensemble work, repertory with other instru\u00ad ments and voice, criticism, and pedagogy. Piano students give weekly solo performances before other students, and also focus on criticism, style, and interpretation. String, wind, brass, percussion, and also piano students focus on quartet work, small ensembles, and solo sonatas privately coached and presented in afternoon recitals. The Bachelor of Arts (B.A.) degree program enables students to pursue elective subjects in music (such as composition or conduct\u00ad ing), in the arts, or in other academic disciplines. Students receive two years of instrumental or vocal instruction and participate at the same time in two years of ensemble or repertory classes. Students also complete a senior project in an area of particular interest (a historical project, a composition, or a lecture/performance). Music scholarships are offered to promising undergraduate per\u00ad formers. Awarding of scholarships is generally based on the pread\u00ad mission auditions which are held in February. The University's Education Abroad Program offers students the opportunity to study abroad during their junior year. Music majors may enroll in conservatories and universities in several countries; highly qualified performers may be eligible to attend the Conserva\u00ad torio G. B. Martini in Bologna, Italy. See the Educational Abroad Program section for additional information. In each baccalaureate degree program, students receive private lessons on their instruments, or in voice, and perform in orchestral . or choral concerts, in chamber ensembles, and in solo recitals; however, such participation varies according to which degree the student elects to pursue. A five-year program coordinated with the UCI Department of Edu\u00ad cation is available for students interested in obtaining a California Teaching Credential. The Master of Fine Arts (M.F.A.) degree program in Music emphasizes composition, choral conducting, voice performance, piano performance, and instrumental performance. PERFORMANCE OPPORTUNITIES ChoraiNocal The Department offers a variety of choral ensembles that give every student, regardless of major, the opportunity to sing. Some groups participate in international concert tours. The California Chamber Singers, Concert Choir, Madrigal Singers, Women's Chorus, and Men's Chorus make up the permanent ensembles. Additional per\u00ad formances are presented in conjunction with professional orches\u00ad tras, invitational festivals, and Southern California concert venues. In December, the Department also produces the annual series of Madrigal Dinners that celebrate the Christmas season at the court of Henry VIII. Instrumental The UCI Symphony Orchestra offers participants an opportunity to explore the great masterworks of the standard orchestral repertory. The orchestra performs a number of programs each year and each performance features a guest artist. Artists have included Lincoln Mayorga, piano; Margaret Strauss Jr.'s Die Fledermaus was presented in conjunction with the Departments of Drama and Dance. Additional student performance opportunities are available with three bands: the Wind Ensemble performs great works from the concert band literature; the Jazz Ensemble is a standard 18-piece big band; and the UCI Band plays at athletic events, including the men's basketball season home games. CAREERS IN MUSIC A degree in Music offers many career opportunities. Music is a highly competitive profession and a degree may or may not lead to professional employment with an orchestra or as a concert artist. Many graduates do, however, become successful freelance mem\u00ad bers of symphony orchestras, composers, and performers. Many others go on to pursue graduate degrees in performance, music his\u00ad tory, conducting, arts management, music librarianship, composi\u00ad tion, or secondary or postsecondary education. Some graduates have made careers in music publishing and in the recording industry. RECOMMENDED PROFICIENCY LEVELS FOR ENTE~ING FRESHMEN All applicants for admission are required to pass an audition in their principal performing medium and will receive infor\u00ad mation concerning the mandatory audition approximately 60 days following the close of the application period. Freshmen students wishing to enter either of the baccalaureate degree programs in Music must demonstrate appropriate perfor\u00ad mance proficiency and should have had a minimum of two years of instrumental or vocal instruction and should know scales, funda\u00ad mental notation, and triads. In addition, they should have the abil\u00ad ity to read music in both treble and bass clefs. Basic keyboard skill is highly desirable, as is experience as a solo performer.

California Institute of the Arts, Lecturer in Studio Art (sculpture and installation art) Anne Walsh, M.F.A. California Institute of the Arts, Lecturer in Studio Art (visual fundamentals, studio methods) The Department of Studio Art takes a wide-ranging, interdiscipli\u00ad nary view of contemporary art practice. The Department prefers a demanding, conceptual approach to work in process, rather than emphasizing traditional notions of product. Students are encour\u00ad aged to develop an individual, disciplined direction through an experimental approach to media, materials, and techniques. To fur\u00ad ther this end, the curriculum provides studio experiences in draw-\u00b7 ing, painting, sculpture, ceramics, photography, digital imaging, and video, in addition to emphasizing cultural studies in relation to contemporary practice. Visiting artists and theorists who teach on a quarterly basis, or who make shorter guest appearances, are an integral part of the program. The University's Education Abroad Program offers students the opportunity to study abroad. Special programs for Studio Art majors are offered in Venice (for graduate-level study also) and in Florence; the latter program, at II Bisonte, focuses on lithography and intaglio printmaking. UC IRVINE - 1996-1997CAREERS FOR THE STUDIO ART MAJOR Departmental faculty and the range of artists whose work is repre\u00ad sented in the UCI Art Gallery exhibitions provide diverse career models. Some graduates go on to careers as exhibiting artists or teachers; others work in arts-related activities in museums, gal\u00ad leries, and artists' organizations. A bachelor's degree in Studio Art is usually required as preparation for graduate-level study in studio art. REQUIREMENTS FOR THE BACHELOR'S DEGREE University Requirements: See pages 57-61.

The emphasis is on experimental, interinedia approaches rather than on the acquisition of traditional techniques. Independent work with faculty is encouraged, and maximum latitude is given in develop\u00ad ing individual research and exhibition projects. Graduate courses combine rigorous critique situations, with faculty as well as visit\u00ad ing artists, and seminars focusing on various aspects of contempo\u00ad rary art theory. Graduate students have regular opportunities to exhibit in the UCI Art Gallery. The program of visiting artists and lecturers is an integral part of the graduate experience.

General Degree Requirements Normally two years of residence are required. Each candidate must enroll for three courses each quarter for six quarters, exclusive of summer sessions. The student's progress and body of work will be reviewed by a faculty committee yearly. A satisfactory opinion by this committee will allow the student to progress to candidacy for the degree. Satisfactory attainment must be demonstrated by a specific creative project, which usually takes the form of a graduate exhibition in the University Art Gallery. This project is to be supported by a the\u00ad sis incorporating visual and written material relevant to the project and the candidate's creative research while at UCI. Oral defense of the project is required. Specific Degree Requirements Seventy-two quarter units in graduate or approved upper-division undergraduate courses must be completed with a grade of at least B or a Satisfactory in each course.

Woolfolk, Ph.D. University of Washington, Professor Emeritus of Biological Sciences Pauline I. Yahr, Ph.D. University of Texas, Professor of Biological Sciences OVERVIEW No one can predict the future, but this much is known: the next quarter century is the time of the biologist, who will be in the fore\u00ad front of the most challenging, intellectual problems, such as under\u00ad standing the most elemental building blocks of the mechanisms of life, the mechanisms of memory and of learning, the molecular basis of embryonic development, and the rules that help predict the behavior of the environment. Biology also lies at the heart of major social problems that face the human race in the coming decade, such as sensible management of the environment and the effective control of human populations. It is vital that educated people understand the contributions that biological sciences have made and will continue to make for the future welfare of human beings. The School of Biological Sciences reflects new concepts of biol\u00ad ogy in both its curriculum and its research programs. The faculty is dedicated to providing students with the opportunity to learn the principles and facts in this ever-expanding field of biology. The curriculum is designed to meet present and future educational needs of majors and nonmajors. In keeping with the responsibili\u00ad ties of the University, the School encourages vigorous faculty and student research programs. It strongly believes that excellence in research is essential for effective, enthusiastic, and up-to-date teaching. The School provides an excellent opportunity for under\u00ad graduates to participate in research, through the Biological Sci\u00ad ences 199 program. Each quarter more than 900 undergraduate stu\u00ad dents and 200 graduate and postdoctoral students participate in independent research programs. In addition to the regular University requirements for admission, students interested in the biological sciences should include in their high school curriculum, in addition to a course in biology, four years of mathematics, as well as courses in chemistry and physics, which are now an integral part of most contemporary biological work. The biological sciences are presented as an integrated area of study through the nine-quarter Biological Sciences Core. Upper-division laboratories and satellite courses developing the major concepts of modem biology expand upon and intensify areas covered in the Core and provide students with the opportunity to specialize in a particular area of the biological sciences. Introductory courses for nonmajors are designed to make the biological sciences meaningful and interesting and to inform intelligent citizens of biological phe\u00ad nomena that affect their daily lives. Graduate courses are offered in all the departments. Students should be aware that psychology courses are offered in several different departments and programs. Students interested in the biological mechanisms of behavior are advised to consult the course listings here in the School of Biological Sciences section. Students interested in other areas of psychology are advised to consult the course listings in the School of Social Ecology and the Department of Cognitive Sciences sections of the Catalogue: Students with an interest in the application of ecology to human needs may choose the Applied Ecology major, which is offered jointly by the School of Biological Sciences and the School of Biological Sciences 119 Social Ecology.

UCI Breadth Requirement Those students majoring in Biological Sciences who have com\u00ad pleted the School requirements and who have passed any two quar\u00ad ters of the writing component of the Humanities Core or its alter\u00ad native with a grade of C or better will have satisfied the UCI breadth requirement, with the exception of: the upper-division writing requirement; Category III, Social and Behavioral Sciences; Category VI, Language Other Than English; and Category VII, Multicultural Studies and International/Global Issues. Specifically, the Humanities Core Course (Humanities lA-B-C) or its alternative satisfies Category IV, Humanistic Inquiry; it also sat\u00ad isfies the lower-division writing requirement when two quarters of the writing component are passed with a grade of C or better. Chemistry and physics satisfy Category II, Natural Sciences. Cate\u00ad gory V, Mathematics and Symbolic Systems, is satisfied by com\u00ad pletion of the School mathematics requirement. PLANNING A PROGRAM OF STUDY Since biological sciences courses are built upon a base of the phys\u00ad ical sciences, it is very important for students to take their required physical sciences early, particularly general and organic chemistry. Students who have not completed high school chemistry are well advised to complete a preparatory chemistry course before entering UCI. The academic program shown is only a suggested program. Students should consult the Biological Sciences Student Affairs Office for individual academic planning. Freshmen will normally take Biological Sciences 94, Humanities 1A, Chemistry lA, and a freshman seminar (Biological Sciences 2A) during the fall quarter. Students not taking Humanities 1A should enroll in Biological Sciences 94 in the fall quarter. Students will then continue with Biological Sciences 96 and complete their general chemistry and humanities requirement the remaining win\u00ad ter and spring quarters. Sophomores begin organic chemistry (Chemistry 51A or 52A), continue the Biological Sciences Core with 97, 98, and 99, and com\u00ad plete the Humanities requirement if they have not taken it during their freshman year. Sophomores often begin taking courses in other disciplines to meet the UCI breadth requirement and fulfill their mathematics requirement if they have not done so as freshmen. During their junior year, most majors complete the Biological Sci\u00ad ences Core and take physics. Students who intend to double major Biological Sciences 121 in Chemistry will be required to take Physics 5A-B-C or H6A-B-C in place of Physics 3A-B-C. Juniors complete their breadth requirements and usually start their research and their upper-divi\u00ad sion laboratory and satellite courses. Since research and the con\u00ad tent of satellite courses are based upon material contained in the Core, it is usually preferable for students to have completed most of the Core before undertaking certain satellite courses or research projects. Finally, during their senior year, students continue their research and their optional specializations by completing the remaining required upper-division laboratory and satellite courses. A special program of study should be considered by students who enter the biological sciences with a weak background in the sci\u00ad ences and/or in writing skills. A weak background might consist of not completing high school chemistry or mathematics through trigonometry, and/or not satisfying the Subject A requirement before entering the University. This program allows a student to gain the necessary background skills and will probably require five years of study at the undergraduate level. Before beginning this program of study, students must see an academic counselor in the Biological Sciences Student Affairs Office.

Students must satisfy the Subject A requirement prior to fulfilling the lower-division writing requirement. Students taking Humanities 1 A must enroll in the Subject A section of this course if they have not satisfied the Subject A requirement. 2 Students may take Chemistry 52A-B-C, 52LA-LB instead of 51A-B-C, 51 LA\u00ad LB. 3 Biological Sciences 1 OOL may be taken concurrently or upon completion of Biological Sciences 98. It must be completed prior to taking the three required upper-division laboratories. 4 In addition to the listed Biological Sciences satellite courses, Chemistry 130A\u00ad B-C or 131A-B-C, and Psychology 112A-B-C (for Biological Sciences/Psy\u00ad chology double majors) are counted as satellites. 5 Electives should be chosen with the following purposes in mind: UCI breadth requirements; students' own - 1996-1997I 122 UCI 1996-97 School of Biological Sciences Special Programs and Courses Biological Sciences 199 Every undergraduate student in the School of Biological Sciences has the opportunity to pursue independent experimental laboratory or field research under the direct supervision of a professor in the School of Biological Sciences or in the College of Medicine as an apprentice scientist. Under the guidance of a senior scientist, the student is able to experience the challenge and excitement of the world of science and to develop new scientific skills. This activity may commence as early as the sophomore year or, in the case of exceptional students, earlier. Interested students should investigate the possibilities for research early in order to obtain a great deal of research experience, if they so desire, before they graduate. Although the School of Biological Sciences does not require training in a foreign language, some areas of research demand that students possess foreign language skills. Students are, therefore, encouraged to discuss foreign lan\u00ad guage needs with their advisors to see if such training is important for their own careers. Advising for research careers in the biologi\u00ad cal sciences is best accomplished by students working together with a faculty advisor. Students are permitted to take a maximum of five units per quarter in all independent study courses taken under any school or program. White Mountain Research Station (WMRS) Supercourse: Environmental Biology The White Mountain Research Station Supercourse exposes and trains students in diverse approaches to solving problems about plant and animal interactions with each other, and with their envi\u00ad ronments, both pristine and human-perturbed. In this course, the Owens Valley of eastern California serves as a microcosm of nat\u00ad ural resource exploitation, symbolic of many global systems, where a major resource (water in this instance) is collected and exported, potentially to the detriment of the source ecosystems. Students are in residence at the WMRS facility in Bishop, Califor\u00ad nia, for the entire spring quarter. Research studies include both tra\u00ad ditional natural history-based field methods, and modern labora\u00ad tory-based techniques. Students enroll in three concurrent courses, worth 4 units each-Field Ecology (Biological Sciences 133), Conservation Biology (Biological Sciences 170), and Physiological Ecology (Biological Sciences 126). In addition, students enroll for 4 units of independent research and give .a poster presentation at the annual Physiological Ecology meeting held at WMRS. Call the Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology at (714) 824-6006 for more information. Howard Hughes Undergraduate Biological Sciences Minority Research and Training Program The Howard Hughes Undergraduate Biological Sciences Minority Research and Training Program was established for underrepre\u00ad sented minorities and women pursuing biological and biomedical research. The program offers research exposure, faculty mentor\u00ad ship, access to a state-of-the-art computer laboratory, summer research internships, academic support, and networking, and pro\u00ad vides opportunities to attend scientific conferences at other institu\u00ad tions. Additional information is available from the Program Office, telephone (714) 824-2363. Excellence in Research Program The School of Biological Sciences believes that successful partici\u00ad pation in creative research is one of the highest academic goals its undergraduates can attain and accordingly rewards such students with Excellence in Biological Sciences Research certificates. Through undergraduate research and the Excellence in Research Program in Biological Sciences, students have the opportunity of presenting the results of their research endeavors to peers and fac\u00ad ulty, and possibly of seeing their research papers published. Selected papers are published in the School's Journal of Under\u00ad graduate Research in the Biological Sciences. All Biological Sciences majors doing experimental research under Biological Sciences 199 who have completed a minimum of three quarters on the same project (with at least one quarter taken during the academic year of the symposium) are eligible to participate. They must be in good academic standing, have a grade point aver\u00ad age of 2.7 or better, and be making normal progress in Biological Sciences. Undergraduate Teaching Opportunities Through the Tutoring Program, students can immediately put to practice skills they have learned in their biology training. This program provides opportunities for students to develop teaching abilities and to perform a worthwhile and necessary service. In the Tutoring Program, UCI students tutor other UCI students in biol\u00ad ogy, chemistry, mathematics, and physics. Minor in Global Sustainability The interdisciplinary: minor in Global Sustainability trains students to understand the changes that need to be made in order for the human population to live in a sustainable relationship with the resources available on this planet. See the Interdisciplinary Studies section of this Catalogue for more information. Education Abroad Program Upper-division students have the opportunity to experience a dif\u00ad ferent culture while making progress toward degree objectives through the Education Abroad Program (EAP). EAP is an overseas study program which operates in cooperation with host universities and colleges throughout the world. See the Center for International Education section for additional information. Students may wish to participate in the Education Abroad Program's Tropical Biology Quarter which is for undergraduates with at least one year of introductory biology, one quarter of upper-division biology, and a serious interest in biological studies. The program includes lectures, field laboratories, and independent research, with an emphasis on direct field experience.

Students normally apply for this program early in their junior year. See the Graduate School of Management section for further information. Special Research Resources Special research resources include the Beckman Laser Facility and Medical Clinic, a research, training, and service facility in the area of laser.microbeam technology; the School of Biological Sciences Biohazard (P-3) Facility, which provides laboratory facilities\u00b7 for working with biological agents or biological molecules such as recombinant DNA which would be hazardous when used in open laboratories; the Developmental Biology Center, devoted to analyz\u00ad ing the cellular and genetic mechanisms underlying growth, de\u00ad velopment, and regeneration; the Center for the Neurobiology of Learning and Memory, a research center for studies of the brain mechanisms underlying learning and memory; the UCI Arboretum, a botanical garden facility; the San Joaquin Freshwater Marsh Reserve, which supports controlled marsh biota; the Burns Pinon Ridge Reserve, a high-desert habitat in San Bernardino County; and the UCI Ecological Preserve, which includes coastal hills on the campus, once under heavy grazing, but now returning to a more natural state. It is important to note that the School has access to the College of Medicine, thereby providing an opportu\u00ad nity for the sharing of both teaching and research activities. UC IRVINE - 1996-1997Advising: Academic, Career, Health Sciences Academic Advising The Biological Sciences Student Affairs Office coordinates the advising program and provides academic counseling as well as special services particularly in the area of preprofessional career counseling. Undergraduate Biological Sciences students should consult the Biological Sciences Student Affairs Office for informa\u00ad tion on academic requirements for the degree, career opportunities, the Biological Sciences 199 Research Program, available tutoring for Biological Sciences courses, Biological Sciences student orga\u00ad nizations, and scholarship information. Students can also come to the Biological Sciences Student Affairs Office to change their major, apply for graduation, or for any other help they might need related to their academic career at UCI. All freshmen will enroll in small-group freshman seminars (Bio\u00ad logical Sciences 2) and all other new students will enroll in special sections of Biological Sciences 190. Upper-division peer advisors are actively involved in these seminars. Peer Academic Advisors. The Peer Academic Advisors are upper\u00ad division Biological Sciences majors who bring with them valuable academic and social experiences. Their functions include counsel\u00ad ing students in matters of major selection, program planning, peti\u00ad tioning, tutoring, learning skills problems, and participation in cocurricular and extracurricular activities. The Peer Advisors are located in the Biological Sciences Student Affairs Office. Office hours are posted at the beginning of each quarter. Career Advising Information on graduate and professional schools in the health sci\u00ad ences can be obtained from the Biological Sciences Student Affairs Office. The UCI Career and Life Planning Center provides services to UCI students and alumni including career counseling, informa\u00ad tion about job opportunities, a career library, and workshops on resume preparation, job search, and interview techniques. See the Career and Life Planning Center section for additional information. The Student Affairs Office has developed a complete career library and a close relationship with the Center in an effort to provide cur\u00ad rent, relevant career information for students. Areas of opportunity open to those with a Bachelor of Science degree include laboratory technology, publishing, technical editing, pharmaceutical sales, and training programs in county, state, and federal agencies. The bachelor's degree is necessary to pursue studies leading to the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees. The B.S. degree, plus short training periods, may prepare students for employment in education, medical technology (usually one year), physical therapy, and various other areas. Education (community colleges, state colleges, or private schools), medical illustration, and public health (which includes hospital administration, biostatistics, epidemiology, environmental health sciences, social work, public health education, maternal and child health, and infectious and tropical diseases) are fields in which opportunities are available upon completion of a Master's program. The Ph.D. degree may lead to research in many areas, among them biochemistry, biometeorology, botany, cytology, ecology, fishery biology, genetics, home economics, microbiology, molecular biol\u00ad ogy, pathology, physiology, psychobiology, public health, range management, soil conservation, and zoology. Other areas where advanced degrees are necessary include medi\u00ad cine, dentistry, law, optometry, podiatry, osteopathy, and veterinary medicine. Biological Sciences 123 Health Sciences Advising Advising for careers in the health sciences is a specialty of the Biological Sciences Student Affairs Office. Students desiring to enter the health sciences should have their programs checked in the Office. They also should check deadlines for taking the Medical College Admission Test (MCAT) or other required tests and appli\u00ad cation deadlines. The New MCAT and the Dental Admission Test, required by most medical and dental schools, are administered in spring and fall each year at UCI. These tests should be taken in the spring, a year and one-half before the student plans to enter med\u00ad ical or dental school. Leaders in nearly all health professional schools recommend that students preparing to seek admission to their schools plan to obtain a bachelor's degree. Students who plan to enter a school of den\u00ad tistry, medicine, or other areas of the health sciences may receive the required preprofessional training at UCI. This preprofessional training may be accomplished by (1) completing the major in Bio\u00ad logical Sciences or (2) majoring in any school or department and fulfilling concurrently the specific course requirements of the den\u00ad tal, medical, or other professional school the student expects to \u00b7attend. Students interested in the health sciences should choose electives in the social sciences, possibly a foreign language, physical chem\u00ad istry, or other specific courses required or recommended by gradu\u00ad ate schools. The Biological Sciences Student Affairs Office offers specialized services, for a fee, to all students applying to postgraduate profes\u00ad sional schools in the health sciences, including a personal file con\u00ad taining the student's letters of recommendation, and a service of sending all recommendations for a student to professional and graduate schools. Student Participation AED. Alpha Epsilon Delta (AED) is a national honor society for students preparing for careers in the health professions. AED strives to stimulate an appreciation of health careers through inter\u00ad action among prehealth students, health educators, and practition\u00ad ers in a variety of health care fields. Guest speakers from every aspect of the health care field highlight weekly meetings. AED annually sponsors workshops on interview techniques and a series of talks on selecting, applying to, and financing medical school. Blood drives sponsored by AED are offered in conjunction with the American Red Cross and take place twice a year. AED recruits new members early in the fall and spring quarters. Because AED is an honor society, membership is contingent upon class ranking (the top 35 percent), completion of five quarters of academic work, and a brief pledge period, during which commitment to the society is assessed. All Students for Health. All Students for Health (ASH) assists pre-health students in attaining their career goals through providing opportunities to learn more about health careers via workshops, field trips, and the ASH volunteer program. The organization also provides information about health professional schools and the application process to these schools, and sponsors tours to various campuses. Social interaction and friendships are promoted between students via counseling and social activities. BSSO. The Black Students Science Organization (BSSO) was established to provide the leadership and academic support neces\u00ad sary for African-American students to successfully complete their undergraduate studies in the biological sciences, physical sciences, and engineering at UCI.

GRADUATE STUDY IN BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES The School of Biological Sciences offers graduate study in a wide variety of fields ranging across the spectrum of the biological sci\u00ad ences. The four Departments of the School of Biological Sciences (Developmental and Cell Biology, Ecology and Evolutionary Biol\u00ad ogy, Molecular Biology and Biochemistry, and Psychobiology) and four basic science Departments of the College of Medicine (Anatomy and Neurobiology, Biological Chemistry, Microbiology and Molecular Genetics, and Physiology and Biophysics), repre\u00ad senting respective concentrations of study under the Ph.D. degree in Biological Sciences, cooperate in the conduct of graduate educa\u00ad tion administered by the School of Biological Sciences. Although all programs admit students for study leading to the Doctor of Phi\u00ad losophy (Ph.D.) degree, the Master of Science (M.S.) degree may be earned in pursuit of the Ph.D. Each department has a graduate advisor whom students may consult in regard to the technical details of the individual programs. Applications for admission to graduate study are evaluated by the department or program to which the student has applied on the basis of letters of recommendation, Graduate Record Examination scores, grades, and other relevant qualifications of the applicant. Candidates for graduate admission are urged to consult the particu\u00ad lar department or program whose faculty and expertise best fit their interests and background. MASTER OF SCIENCE AND DOCTOR OF PHILOSOPHY IN THE BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES While both the Master of Science and Doctor of Philosophy pro\u00ad grams are offered, emphasis at the graduate level is on the Ph.D. programs. Most training takes place within one of the departments, although full facilities and curricular offerings are available to all graduate students in all departments of the Biological Sciences. Interdisciplinary study and research are encouraged. Students are expected to maintain a B average at all times, attain the Master's degree in two years, and attain the Ph.D. in four or five years, depending on departmental affiliation. A Master's degree, however, is not a prerequisite for the Ph.D. degree. During the first part of the initial year of graduate work, the stu\u00ad dent plans an academic program in consultation with the graduate advisor or a small committee. Faculty advisors are changed if the specific interests of the student change. In addition, it is possible for students to transfer to another program in the School, subject to the approval of the Dean of Graduate Studies, provided they are accepted into that program. Students are encouraged to consult with other faculty members with regard to their research and acad\u00ad emic interests. During their graduate training all students will serve some time as teacher apprentices under the direction of advanced teaching assis\u00ad tants and faculty. Advanced graduate students may work closely with faculty in the planning and execution of the teaching program. The amount and exact nature of the teaching experience varies with the department. Master of Science Depending upon the program, there are two plans by which a Mas\u00ad ter of Science degree may be obtained. Plan 1: Thesis Plan. The student completes seven upper-division and graduate courses including a minimum of five nonresearch courses. The student then presents a thesis based upon research done while in the School. Plan II: Comprehensive Examination Plan. The student com\u00ad pletes a minimum of nine upper-division and graduate courses. At least six must be graduate courses (numbered 200-299) in the stu\u00ad dent's field specialization. This program is terminated with a com\u00ad prehensive final examination. Doctor of Philosophy First Level of Competence. The student attains this level by completing oral or written examinations at the discretion of the department. Second Level of Competence. This level is attained by passing an examination dealing with the student's particular interests. A committee for the purpose of administering this examination is appointed by the School, on behalf of the Dean of Graduate Stud\u00ad ies and the Graduate Council. Once this examination is completed, the student is advanced to candidacy for the degree and is considered to have formally begun dissertation research. The student submits a dissertation on this research and defends it at an oral examination during the final year of graduate study. Graduate student status or consent of instructor is a prerequisite for all 200-299 courses. INTERDISCIPLINARY GRADUATE PROGRAMS The School is structured in a manner that encourages an interdisci\u00ad plinary approach to scientific problems. Interaction and coopera\u00ad tive efforts across traditional institutional boundaries are especially evident in the School's participation in various organized research units (described in the previous Research and Graduate Studies section) and in two interdepartmental!interschool graduate pro\u00ad grams described below.

Each depart\u00ad ment administers a graduate concentration in association with the MBGB program, which leads to the Ph.D. degree in Biological . Sciences. The MBGB program is designed to offer students a um\u00ad fied curriculum, broad training, and a wide range of research opportunities in the following areas: cancer biology, cell biolo~y, developmental biology, genetics, immunology and pathogenests, mechanisms of gene expression, molecular neurobiology, molecu\u00ad lar physiology and biophysics, structural biology/protein engineer\u00ad ing, and virology. The goal of the combined program is to produce creative and productive scientists who have an in-depth compre\u00ad hension in a given subspecialty. During the five years established as the normative time for com\u00ad pleting the Ph.D. degree, students complete the MBGB program UC IRVINE - 1996-1997132 UCI 1996-97 School of Biological Sciences requirements during their first two years, and in the remaining three years, complete the requirements of one of the five affiliated concentrations. In the first year of study, emphasis is placed on immediate research participation supported by formal course work in protein and nucleic acid biochemistry, cell biology, and gene expression, and one genetics course. At the end of the first year, student competence and critical thinking in the molecular aspects of biological sciences are.tested through a comprehensive prelimi\u00ad nary examination and overall evaluation. Selection of an advisor from among the more than 80 laboratories usually occurs prior to the preliminary examination. Regular teaching of undergraduates is part of graduate student training in the second year of study. At this time, students also begin to lay the experimental foundation for their dissertation project proposal. During the second year and beyond, students participate in the departmental journal club and seminar series of the department in which they have elected to carry out their dissertation work, as specified by the concentration requirements. In years three and beyond, students fulfill depart\u00ad mental requirements for the Ph.D. Further information is available in the Catalogue sections of the participating departments and through the MBGB program office in the Biological Sciences Administration building. Applicants should have significant laboratory experience and be well-prepared in calculus, physics, organic chemistry, and bio\u00ad chemistry.

This has provided new approaches to the basic study of protein structure and function, as well as the opportunity to design and produce pro\u00ad teins with a broad spectrum of industrial and health-related appli\u00ad cations. The School of Biological Sciences, in conjunction with the Department of Chemistry in the School of Physical Sciences and the Department of Chemical and Biochemical Engineering in the School of Engineering, offer an interdisciplinary graduate program leading to the Ph.D. in Biological Sciences, Chemistry, or Engi\u00ad neering with a concentration in Protein Engineering Science. The program brings together faculty with research interests in: struc\u00ad ture/function of enzymes, metalloproteins, receptors, and X\u00ad ray crystallography. Upon entrance to the program, students choose a Protein Engineer\u00ad ing curriculum leading to one of the three degrees. First-year stu\u00ad dents take courses in molecular biology and protein chemistry, structure, and engineering, and complete three laboratory rotations of their choice. Additional elective courses, current literature semi\u00ad nars, and research presentations are used to broaden training in subsequent years. A qualifying examination is administered at the end of the first year for students in the Schools of Biological Sci\u00ad ences and Engineering. For students in Chemistry, a written exami\u00ad nation is administered early in the second year. Students are then expected to select a laboratory and begin work toward completion of a Ph.D. dissertation based upon their own original research. Stu\u00ad dents advance to candidacy for the Ph.D. by presenting their dis\u00ad sertation proposal to an examining committee which also guides and advises the students and monitors research progress throughout their graduate training. The normal time for completion of the Ph.D. is five years. DEPARTMENT OF DEVELOPMENTAL AND CELL BIOLOGY 5205 Biological Sciences II; (714) 824-6681 Susan V.

Weller: Plant reproductive ecology; plant population ecology Ecology and evolutionary biology deals with the establishment of adaptations over evolutionary time and with the organismal func\u00ad tion in ecological time. Faculty in the Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology study questions pertinent at a variety of lev\u00ad els of biological organization, from molecular aspects of evolution, to organismal structure and performance, to the ecology of ocean ecosystems. Research is conducted in both the laboratory and field and includes work on a variety of organisms from phage and bacte\u00ad ria, to higher plants and animals. Primary attention is given to evolu\u00ad tionary, ecological, and functional questions rather than to particular habitats or taxa. Faculty and graduate student research is often col\u00ad laborative and interdisciplinary in approach. Departmental research activities include physiological ecology energetics, plant-herbivore and plant-pollinator interactions, microbial ecology and coevolu\u00ad tion, quantitative genetics, life history evolution, population and reproductive ecology, and community ecology. These research endeavors provide a balance between empirical and theoretical approaches to evolutionary, organismal, and ecological problems. Primary emphasis in the graduate program is placed on training leading to the Ph.D. in Biological Sciences; under exceptional cir\u00ad cumstances, a student may be admitted initially to the M.S. pro\u00ad gram. A basic course sequence consisting of Ecology and Evolu\u00ad tionary Biology 205, 206, 207, and 208 is recommended for most entering students during their first year. At the end of the first year, students complete an oral examination based upon three of these course!! (205, 206, and 208) and other materials the Department might require. Satisfactory performance on this examination is required for continuation in the graduate program. Each entering graduate student chooses a faculty advisor and a three-person advisory committee for guidance, with whom the stu\u00ad dent meets at least twice each year. All students are encouraged to submit a research proposal to their advisory committee during their first year of residency. A comprehensive proposal is required before the end of the second year. The progress of each student is reviewed by the departmental faculty once each academic year. Normally, all requirements for the Ph.D. should be completed within five years. No more than six years will be allowed for com\u00ad pletion of the program. Advancement to doctoral candidacy by a comprehensive oral examination will be expected during the third year for students entering with a B.A. or B.S. or during the second year for those entering with an M.A. or M.S. Applicants for this program should have a solid undergraduate program in biology and ecology, emphasizing both research and field work. In addition, course work in statistics, mathematics, and physical and chemical sciences is expected. All applicants are required to submit aptitude and advanced biology GRE scores. The deadline for application is January 15. Courses in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology 200A-B-C Research in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology (2 to 12 per quarter) F, W, S.

Weiss: Excitatory amino acids in neural signaling and neuro\u00ad degeneration Pauline I. Yahr: Behavioral neuroendocrinology Psychobiology is concerned with the biology of the nervous system and behavior. The Department of Psychobiology emphasizes the adaptive aspects of neural and behavioral plasticity. The faculty's research interests include the biochemical, endocrinological, genetic, and experiential determinants of nervous system function and behavior. Focal topics synaptic processes, and memory, reproductive behavior, and communica\u00ad tion. The importance of developmental and comparative approaches to these problems is stressed. The Department of Psychobiology offers graduate training leading to the Ph.D. in Biological Sciences. Graduate students must com\u00ad plete a sequence of core courses (lectures and laboratories) during their first year, and maintain an overall GPA of 3.3 or better. They also must take a minimum of four advanced courses before gradua\u00ad tion and must participate in directed research and teaching each year. During their second year, students prepare a Master's thesis, which must be defended by the end of that year. All students meet\u00ad ing minimal requirements will receive an M.S. degree, but only those students judged well qualified will be recommended for con\u00ad tinuation in the Ph.D. program. To advance to candidacy for the Ph.D., students must further prepare a research proposal and must pass an oral examination by the end of the third year. Graduation depends on successful preparation and oral defense of a disserta\u00ad tion based on the student's research. Students are expected to com\u00ad plete this program in flve years of study. Ideally, applicants for this program should have taken undergradu\u00ad ate courses in biology (one introductory year plus some advanced UC IRVINE - 1996-1997work), psychology (experimental, physiological, and learning), chemistry through biochemistry, introductory physics, calculus, and statistics. They also must submit GRE Aptitude test scores. Because graduate training emphasizes research, preference is given to applicants having laboratory research experience as undergradu\u00ad ates. Although students are examined for an M.S. degree as an intercalated part of the Ph.D. program, the Department accepts only those students seeking a doctorate. Applicants with substantial outside commitments that would curtail laboratory research or pro\u00ad long the time to degree are not accepted. Students are encouraged to take the GRE no later than October. The deadline for application is January 7. Courses in Psychobiology 200A-B-C Research in Psychobiology (2 to 12 per quarter) F, W, S.

Weiss: Mechanisms of neural degeneration The Department of Anatomy and Neurobiology in the College of Medicine offers a doctoral program leading to the Ph.D. degree in UC IRVINE - 1996-1997Biological Sciences, with specialized research training in the neu\u00ad rosciences. Research programs in the neurosciences include molec\u00ad ular neurobiology, mechanisms of neural development, ion channel physiology, experimental neuroanatomy, cellular neurobiology, and structure and function of sensory and motor systems. The Depart\u00ad ment maintains research facilities to provide the student with expe\u00ad rience in a variety of techniques laser confocal microscopy; and computer analysis of data. Students are encouraged to become proficient in multiple areas of study using interdisciplinary techniques. Students in the Department of Anatomy and Neurobiology have two major goals. The first goal is to attain the necessary technical skills, theoretical background, and experimental knowledge neces\u00ad sary to conduct innovative and fundamentally important research. The second goal is to gain the knowledge and ability to teach grad\u00ad uate, undergraduate, and professional courses in the neurosciences. These two goals are achieved through\u00b7a basic and extended acade\u00ad mic program that is tailored to the individual needs of the student. The new combined neurosciences graduate core curriculum is designed to provide all students with a fundamental knowledge of modem neurobiology, with an emphasis on molecular, morphologi\u00ad cal, and physiological approaches. In the first year, students are required to take selected courses in neuroanatomy, neurophysiol\u00ad ogy, cell and molecular neurobiology, and developmental neurobi\u00ad ology. In the second year, students select from a variety of courses including neural systems, neurochemistry, and pharmacology. Over the usual four-year training period the student is required to com\u00ad plete a practical course in statistics, selected seminar courses, at least two laboratory rotations, and a total of 50 credit hours of research. The student typically devotes the majority of the first year to taking core courses and about half of the second year to taking electives. Following the first year, the student is expected to act as a teaching assistant in the neuroanatomy core course. The emphasis of the graduate program in Anatomy and Neuro\u00ad biology is on research, and a student's participation in laboratory research begins in the first week of graduate study. Students rotate through at least two laboratories during the first year. By the end of the first year the student and the Graduate Committee select a faculty sponsor who will supervise the dissertation research. A two-part Qualifying Examination is given to the student by a Can\u00ad didacy Committee no later than the end of the fall quarter of the third year. The first part consists of a written examination in three of the following areas: molecular The second part consists of an oral examination and a dissertation proposal. The dissertation research topic is chosen by the student and faculty advisor under guidance of the Dissertation Committee, and an oral research proposal is made. The majority of the third and fourth years is devoted to completing the research and preparing a written dissertation suitable for publication. An oral defense of the dissertation research before the student's advisor and Dissertation Committee constitutes the final examina\u00ad tion. The Ph.D. degree in Biological Sciences is awarded following completion of all the requirements, a process that normally will take four. to five years to complete.

University of La Verne, Lecturer (school law, labor relations) The Department of Education is dedicated to academic scholarship and the application of research to educational practice. The Depart\u00ad ment offers programs leading to credentials required for teaching or administration in the public schools of California, and to the Ed.D. degree in Educational Administration. Faculty associated with the Department of Education include researchers and scholars of national and international reputation. Many faculty have taught or served as administrators in public schools, and all are commited to the continued improvement of education through conducting research and the development of more effective approaches to teaching. Teaching and Service Credential Programs The Department of Education offers professional education pro\u00ad grams which lead to California teaching and service credentials as established by the Teacher Preparation and Licensing Law of 1970, known generally as the Ryan Act. The Department of Education offers full-time programs leading to California's two basic teaching credentials-the Single Subject c;::redential and the Multiple Subject Credential. There are two paths available to obtain the teaching credential: the Intern Teaching Cre\u00ad dential Program and the Student Teaching Credential Program. Preliminary and Professional Clear Teaching Credentials The Preliminary Credential is awarded by the State upon com\u00ad pletion of a baccalaureate degree, the professional education course sequence, a course in the teaching of reading, student teaching, a college-level course or examination covering the U.S. Constitution, the passage of the California Basic Education Skills Test, (CBEST), and verification of subject matter competence, e.g., Praxis II, Single Subject Assessment for Teaching (SSAT), or an approved subject-matter program. (See Verification of Subject Matter Competence). The Professional Clear Credential is awarded by the State upon completion of a baccalaureate degree and all fifth-year requirements. The fifth year is defined as 45 quarter units of upper-division or graduate-level post-baccalaureate courses including computer edu\u00ad cation, special education, mainstreaming, and health education which requires Cardio-Pulmonary Resuscitation training. The fifth year may also include the professional education program. Intern Teaching Credential Program Through the intern program, a student may earn a stipend for one year of teaching while completing either the Multiple or Single Subject Credential requirements. The stipend is paid by the school district. To serve as an intern in a school district, the student must be enrolled as a graduate student in the Department of Education. Intern teachers are selected by participating school districts and UCI based on the background and experience of the candidate, the needs of the particular school district, and the candidate's eligibil\u00ad ity for UCI's Education program. The number of internships varies from year to year. For further information see the intern program coordinator in the Department of Education. UC IRVINE - 1996-1997144 UCI 1996-97 Department of Education Student Teaching Credential Program The Student Teaching Credential Program is characterized by a full year of involvement in the public schools beginning with school observations in the fall quarter and culminating in student teaching during the winter and spring quarters. (Students are required to begin the school observations when the public schools open in September. Student teaching concludes as the public schools com\u00ad plete the school year in June.) Intensive course work in the fall quarter prepares students for full\u00ad time student teaching experiences which begin in the winter and continue through the spring quarter. Course work related to student teaching continues at a reduced level during the winter and spring quarters. The student teaching experiences are supervised by school-site teachers trained as University Associates. SINGLE SUBJECT INSTRUCTION \"Single subject instruction\" means the practice of teaching in a specific subject area, as is commonly practiced in California high schools and junior high schools. UCI offers Single Subject Teach\u00ad ing Credentials in art, English, languages other than English, mathe\u00ad matics, music, sciences, and social science. Candidates who enroll in the Single Subject Credential program at UCI generally are required to take the following courses: Educa\u00ad tion 101, 102A-G (students enroll in the section of their proposed credential * Ed. 173 is a prerequisite and must be successfully completed prior to beginning the credential program. Ed. 176 may substitute for Ed. 173. NOTE: In addition to Ed. 173, Ed. 124 is a prerequisite for students pursuing the CLAD/BCLAD emphasis. t Ed. 162, 302B, 302LB, and 380 are required for the Professional Clear Creden\u00ad tial and must be taken within five years of issuance of the Preliminary Creden\u00ad tial.

MULTIPLE SUBJECT INSTRUCTION \"Multiple subject instruction\" means the practice of teaching mul\u00ad tiple subjects as commonly practiced in California elementary schools. Candidates who enroll in the Multiple Subject Credential program at UCI generally are required to take * Ed. 173 is a prerequisite and must be successfully completed prior to beginning the program. Ed. 176 may substitute for Ed. 173. NOTE: In addition to Ed. 173, Ed. 124 is a prerequisite for students pursuing the CLAD/BCLAD emphasis. t Ed. 162, 301B, 301LB, and 380 are required for the Professional Clear Creden\u00ad tial and must be taken within five years of issuance of the Preliminary Creden\u00ad tial.

Multiple Subject candidates are assigned to teach in grades K-6. Student teaching for Multiple Subject candidates is defined as a full-day, four-day per week assignment during the first quarter of student teaching and a full-day, five-day per week assignment dur\u00ad ing the second quarter. The assignment is split to include two lev~ els within the K-6 range. Each student will have student teaching and/or field experience in a multi-or cross-cultural situation. Clearances for student teaching are processed by the Department of Education and are contingent upon the Certificate of Clearance, a current tuberculin test clearance, academic preparation clearances including CBEST, and verification of subject matter competence. A grade of B or better is required in all courses and student teach\u00ad ing for successful completion of the program. If competence has been demonstrated by the conclusion of the student teaching pro\u00ad gram and all other requirements are met, the student is eligible for a credential recommendation by UCI. Administrative Services Credential Services Credentilils are issued by the State in pupil personnel ser\u00ad vices, administrative services, health services, library services, and clinical-rehabilitative services. UCI offers a program leading to the Professional Administrative Services Credential generally required for school administrators. The Administrative Services Credential is a two-stage credential. In the first stage, a candidate obtains the Preliminary Administra\u00ad tive Services Credential by completing an approved program and by securing an administrative position in public education. It is at this point that the candidate begins pursuing the Professional Administrative Services Credential (stage two). The Professional Administrative Services Credential requires the completion of 36 quarter units and two years of acceptable full\u00ad time administrative experience. These requirements must be com\u00ad pleted prior to the expiration date of the Preliminary Administra\u00ad tive Services Credential. Students interested in this credential should make an appointment with a counselor in the Department of Education. Preparation for Applying to the Credential Programs A student's eligibility for admission is supported by passing the CBEST and successfully completing the appropriate subject area examinations or an approved subject matter program prior to applying for admission to the Department of Education. Reservations to take examinations must be made well in advance of the test date. Students are urged to contact the Department of Education for information about the tests and test dates at least one year before application deadline. The Department of Education recommends appropriate field expe\u00ad riences prior to entering the program. Course credit for field expe\u00ad rience is available through Education 100, as well as through other University programs. Field experience can also be earned by other appropriate activities, e.g., tutoring, assisting in public school classrooms, and participating in the Teachers of Tomorrow Club. An application is enhanced if prerequisite courses (Education 173 for all teaching credential programs and Education 124 for the CLAD/BCLAD emphasis) are completed prior to application. Edu\u00ad cation 176 may be substituted for Education 173. UC IRVINE - 1996-1997ADMISSION TO THE CREDENTIAL PROGRAMS Information and applications are available from the Department of Education, 245 Berkeley Place. Admission is based on a broad index, including, but not limited to, the following: Academic Achievement. Completion of a baccalaureate degree from an accredited institution and a minimum grade point average of 3.0 will support consideration of admission to the Department of Education. Undergraduates who enroll in courses leading to acre\u00ad dential are not guaranteed admission to the program; admission through the regular graduate admissions process is required. Written Recommendations. Three letters of recommendation are required for admission. These letters should relate to the student's potential for success in teaching or administration and should indi\u00ad cate the student's ability to perform graduate-level work. For appli\u00ad cants to the teaching credential programs, at least one letter should be from an instructor in the student's undergraduate major. CBEST. Evidence of having passed the California Basic Educa\u00ad tional Skills Test should accompany the application for admission. Absence of Criminal Conviction that Would Preclude the Issuance of a Credential. All students are required by law to obtain a Certificate of Clearance from the Commission on Teacher Credentialing prior to beginning student teaching. This process is primarily a fingerprint check to determine that the student is clear of criminal conviction. See a counselor upon admission to the Department of Education for advice on how to handle this process. Verification of Subject Matter Competence Single Subject Credential. California requires all credential can\u00ad didates to demonstrate subject matter competence prior to student teaching. This can be achieved by passing the appropriate Praxis II subject assessments and the SSAT specialty area tests or by com\u00ad pleting a subject matter program in the teaching area. (Students pursuing a subject matter program may student teach with a mini\u00ad mum of four-fifths of the subject matter program completed. How\u00ad ever, the entire subject matter program must be completed for the credential.) Many academic majors at UCI, which correspond to disciplines commonly taught in public schools, are approved as subject matter programs if additional specific requirements are met. Students should consult a counselor in the Department of Education for detailed information. Multiple Subject Credential. The Praxis II Multiple Subject Assessment for Teachers (MSAT) or an approved subject matter program is a requirement for the Multiple Subject Credential. The MSAT consists of three sections: Content Knowledge, Content Area Exercises 1, and Content Area Exercises 2. It includes the following areas: English, mathematics, science, social science, physical education, human development, and visual and perform\u00ad ing arts. All students must pass the MSAT prior to beginning stu\u00ad dent teaching or must complete at least four-fifths of an approved subject matter program. Completion of the entire subject matter program or the passage of the MSAT is required for the credential. Supplementary and Additional Teaching Authorizations After acquiring a basic credential, it is possible to add further teaching authorizations. Students wishing to be authorized in more than one subject area may qualify in either of two ways: 1. Students may complete 30 quarter units (15 units if they are upper-division) in college-level course work to develop a sup\u00ad plementary authorization to teach in areas other than the major teaching area. Consult a counselor in the Department of Educa\u00ad tion for details. Education 145 2. Students may pass the appropriate examinations in any area of their choice and thus qualify for the additional teaching autho\u00ad rization in that subject. CLAD/BLCAD EMPHASIS PROGRAM The California Commission on Teacher Credentialing has adopted new credential regulations to authorize both Single Subject and Multiple Subject teachers to serve the State's growing number of Limited-English-Proficient (LEP) students. In accordance with these new regulations, UCI offers the Crosscultural Language and Academic Development (CLAD) emphasis and the Bilingual Crosscultural Language and Academic Development (BCLAD) emphasis in Spanish. (The CLAD/BCLAD emphasis is not avail\u00ad able through the intern program.) After meeting prerequisites Education 173 and 124, and verifica\u00ad tion of experience related to a second language, and immediately before the teacher preparation year, CLAD/BCLAD candidates attend a summer seminar and practicum (Education 165, 166, and 167). BCLAD candidates must demonstrate advanced language proficiency in Spanish, complete the CLAD seminar and practicum, and follow the bilingual teaching course requirements. Upon successful completion of the CLAD/BCLAD summer pro\u00ad gram and the academic year teacher education program, students are eligible for a preliminary teaching credential with a CLAD/ BCLAD emphasis. Graduate Degree Programs MASTER OF SCIENCE IN CHEMISTRY OR MATHEMATICS WITH A tEACHING CREDENTIAL In cooperation with the Department of Chemistry and the Depart\u00ad ment of Mathematics, the Department of Education sponsors coor\u00ad dinated two-year programs leading to the California Single Subject Teaching Credential and a Master of Science degree in Chemistry or Mathematics. Additional information is available from the Department of Education counseling office and the graduate affairs office in the Departments of Chemistry and Mathematics. DOCTORAL DEGREE IN EDUCATIONAL ADMINISTRATION The Department of Education, in cooperation with the School of Education at the University of California, Los Angeles, offers a program leading to the Ed.D. degree in Educational Administra\u00ad tion. The Ed.D. program aims to prepare outstanding educational leaders who are able to articulate and accomplish important improvements in educational practice while attending to the com\u00ad plex demographic, social, and economic challenges faced by K -12 education. The program emphasizes a range of social and behav\u00ad ioral science frameworks and research methodologies relevant to scholarship about schooling and has a strong focus on using theory and research to select, orchestrate, and implement useful and effec\u00ad tive educational practices. Admission Requirements Applicants submit transcripts, three letters of recommendation, and scores from the General Test of the Graduate Record Examination. Other requirements include samples of written work and demon\u00ad strated evidence of potential for leadership in school administra\u00ad tion, educational policy, or other fields pertinent to school practice and educational scholarship. Program of Study Course work is covered in three years-including three summers\u00ad of study prior to the dissertation. Students enroll for no more than eight units per quarter during the academic year, and most quarters enroll for only six units. All students begin work in the summer. UC IRVINE - 1996-1997I 146 UCI 1996-97 Department of Education During the first and second years, all courses are taken at UCI, with the exception that a student may petition to take a substitute course at UCLA. Three quarters of registration will be at UCLA, mainly during the third year. Students admitted to the program are expected to take all courses on schedule. First-Year Requirements First-year required courses. During the first academic year, the following courses covering fundamental issues in the study of schooling and educational leadership are required: History of School Innovations and Current Reform Movements (Education 250); Organizational Theory, Planning, and Application (Education 271); Philosophy and Ethics of Educational Leadership (Education 272); Student Assessment (Education 273A); First-Year Seminar (Education 259A); Functional, Interpretive, and Critical Analyses of Schooling (Education 260); School Restructuring and Resource Allocation (Education 277 A).

Aca\u00ad demic study combined with individual and group research projects prepare students for the professional practice of engineering. Pro\u00ad grams of study at all levels emphasize fundamental principles in order to provide the basis for lifelong professional development as technology continues to evolve. The School offers undergraduate majors in Aerospace Engineering (AE), Chemical Engineering (ChE), Civil Engineering (CE), Com\u00ad puter Engineering (CpE), Electrical Engineering (EE), Engineering (a general program, GE), Environmental Engineering (EnE), and Mechanical Engineering (ME). The majors in Aerospace, Chemi\u00ad cal, Civil, Computer, Electrical, and Mechanical Engineering are accredited by the Engineering Accreditation Commission of the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology. Aerospace Engineering considers the flight characteristics, perfor\u00ad mance, and design of aircraft and spacecraft. An upper-division series of courses in aerodynamics, propulsion, structures, and control follows a common core with Mechanical Engineering. The UC IRVINE - 1996-1997skills acquired in those courses are integrated in the capstone aero\u00ad space design course. The intent of the program is to produce highly proficient engineers who can tackle the aerospace engineering challenges of the future. See pages 180-185. Chemical Engineering applies the knowledge of chemistry, mathe\u00ad matics, physics, biology, and humanities to solve societal problems in areas such as energy, health, the environment, food, textiles, shelter, and materials. Employment opportunities exist in various industries such as chemical, petroleum, polymer, pharmaceutical, food, textile, fuel, consumer products, and materials. See pages 161-164. The study of Civil Engineering addresses the challenges of large\u00ad scale engineering projects of importance to society as a whole, such as water distribution, transportation, and building design. Specializations are provided in Environmental, Structural, Trans\u00ad portation, and Water Resources Engineering. See pages 165-170. The undergraduate curriculum in Computer Engineering addresses the design and analysis of digital computers, including both soft\u00ad ware and hardware. Computer design includes topics such as computer architecture, VLSI circuits, design automation, system software, and data structures and algorithms. Courses include pro\u00ad gramming in high-level languages such as Pascal, C, FORTRAN; use of software packages for analysis and design; design of system software such as editors, compilers, debuggers, and operating sys\u00ad tems; application of computers in solving engineering problems, and laboratories in both hardware and software experiences. See pages 173-179. Electrical Engineering is one of the major contributors to the mod\u00ad ernization of our society. Many of the most basic and pervasive products and services are either based on or related to the scientific and engineering principles taught at the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering. Students can specialize in four general areas of studies-Electro-optics and Solid-State Devices, Micro\u00ad electronics Systems Manufacturing, Power Systems, and Systems and Signal Processing-all at the forefront of technological advancement. See pages 173-179. The major in Engineering is a special program of study for upper\u00ad division students who wish to combine the study of engineering principles with other areas such as the physical and biological sci\u00ad ences, social and behavioral science, humanities, and arts. Students may construct their own specialization. See pages 156-158. Environmental Engineering concerns the development of strategies to control and minimize pollutant emissions, to treat waste, and to remediate polluted natural systems. Emphasis areas include water quality, air quality and combustion, and water resources engineering. See pages 165-170. Mechanical Engineering considers the design, control, and motive power of machinery ranging from household appliances to space\u00ad craft. Specializations allow students to focus their technical elec\u00ad tives in the areas of Aerospace Engineering, Combustion/Propul\u00ad sion, Heat Transfer/Fluid Mechanics, Materials Science and Engineering, and Mechanical Systems. See pages 180-185. Graduate study is offered leading to the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in Chemical and Biochemical Engineering; Civil Engineering; Elec\u00ad trical and Computer Engineering with concentrations in Electrical Engineering and in Computer Engineering; Engineering, with con\u00ad centrations in Environmental Engineering, Materials Science and Engineering, and Protein Engineering Science; and Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering. Specialized research opportunities are available within each of these programs. Bioreaction and bioreactor engineering, recombinant cell technology, and bioseparation processes are research areas in Biochemical Engineering. In Civil Engineering, research opportunities are provided in structural/ earthquake engineering, reliability engineering, transportation sys\u00ad tems engineering, environmental engineering, and water resources. Engineering 153 Research opportunities in Electrical and Computer Engineering are available in the areas of distributed computer systems, image engi\u00ad neering, machine vision, optical and solid-state devices, photonics, and manufacturing.

UNDERGRADUATE PROGRAM Undergraduate Student Affairs Office 101 Engineering and Computing Trailer; (714) 824-4334 John LaRue, Associate Dean PLANNING A PROGRAM OF STUDY Advising Academic advising is available from academic counselors and peer advisors in the School's Undergraduate Student Affairs Office, 101 Engineering and Computing Trailer, and from faculty advisors. Stu\u00ad dents must realize, however; that ultimately they alone are respon\u00ad sible for the planning of their own program and for satisfactory completion of the graduation requirements. Students are encour\u00ad aged to consult with the academic counselors in the Engineering Undergraduate Student Affairs Office whenever they desire to change their program of study. All Engineering majors are required to meet with their faculty advisor at least once each year. It is not uncommon for engineering students to need more than four years to obtain their B.S. degree, particularly if part-time employment or extracurricular activities make heavy demands on their time. Occasionally students can catch up by enrolling in sum\u00ad mer sessions at UCI or at other institutions when a petition has been approved in advance. High-achieving students may declare a double major. Early consul\u00ad tation with the School is advisable. Students may substitute courses of their choosing for those required if they can substantiate the merits of the program of study and obtain prior approval from faculty of the School. Students should be aware that most Engineering courses require the completion of prerequisites. The sample programs shown in each departmental description constitute preferred sequences which take into account all prerequisites. Students must complete all of the required lower-division courses in the freshman and sophomore years in order to enroll in any upper-division Engineering course. UC IRVINE - 1996-1997I 154 UCI 1996-97 School of Engineering School of Engineering policy does not permit the addition or dele\u00ad tion of Engineering courses after the third week of the quarter. Individual instructors may have more stringent add/drop policies; students should request a statement of the instructor's policy at the beginning of each quarter's class. Qualified undergraduate students who have high academic stand\u00ad ing, who have completed the necessary prerequisites, and who have obtained permission from the School's Undergraduate Studies Committee may take certain graduate-level courses. Students are required to complete UCI's lower-division writing requirement (see the Requirements for a Bachelor's Degree sec\u00ad tion) during the first two years. Thereafter, proficiency in writing and computing (using a higher-level language such as BASIC, FORTRAN, and/or Pascal) is expected in all Engineering courses. Students in the School of Engineering, in accordance with general campus policy, are permitted to take courses in certain areas on a Pass/Not Pass basis. With respect to programs in Engineering, such areas are courses which do not fulfill the major requirements and the breadth courses (except for courses taken in fulfillment of the UCI Subject A and upper-division writing requirements). Admissions The sequential nature of the Engineering program and the fact that many courses are offered only once a year make it beneficial for students to begin their studies in the fall quarter. Applicants wish\u00ad ing to be admitted for the fall quarter, 1997 must have submitted their completed application forms during the priority filing period (November 1-30, 1996). High school students wishing to enter the UCI Engineering pro\u00ad gram are advised to have completed four years of mathematics and one year each of physics and chemistry. That preparation, along with honors courses and advanced placement courses, is funda\u00ad mental to success in the Engineering program and is vital to receiving first consideration for admittance to an Engineering major during periods of restricted enrollments. Special attention will also be given to applicants who have submitted their SAT I and three SAT II examination scores by mid-January, 1997. Appli\u00ad cants must apply for admission to a specific Engineering major. If enrollment limitations make it necessary, unaccornrnodated Engineering applicants may be offered alternative majors at UCI. Transfer students may be admitted to a program in the School of Engineering either from another major at UCI or from another col\u00ad lege or university, including a community college. A student seek\u00ad ing admission to the School of Engineering from colleges and schools other than UCI must satisfy the University requirements for admission with advanced standing and should have completed the appropriate prerequisites for the major they wish to enter. It is to the student's advantage to complete as much of the UCI breadth and lower-division requirements as possible prior to transferring to UCI. Since the requirements vary from major to major, those con\u00ad templating admission with advanced standing to the School should consult each Department's Catalogue section and the Office of Undergraduate Student Affairs, 101 Engineering and Computing Trailer, (714) 824-4334, for the specific requirements of each pro\u00ad gram. All transfer students should arrange for early consultation with the Office so that a smooth transition can be planned. Proficiency Examinations A student may take a course by examination with the approval of the faculty member in charge of the course and the Dean of the School. Normally, ability will be demonstrated by a written or oral examination; if a portion of the capability involves laboratory exer\u00ad cises, the student may be required to perform experiments as well. The proficiency examination is not available for any course a stu\u00ad dent has completed at UCI. CAREER ADVISING The Career and Life Planning Center provides services to UCI stu\u00ad dents and alumni including career counseling, information about job opportunities, a career library, and workshops on resume preparation, job search, and interview techniques. See the Career and Life Planning Center section for additional information. In addition, special career planning events are held throughout the year including an annual Career Fair. Individual career counseling is available, and students have access to the Career Library which contains information on graduate and professional schools in engi\u00ad neering, as well as general career information. HONORS Graduation with Honors. Undergraduate honors at graduation in the School of Engineering are computed by using 50 percent of the overall UCI GPA and 50 percent of the upper-division Engineering GPA. (Engineering E190 is not used in the calculation of the upper-division GPA.) A general criterion is that students must have completed at least 72 units in residence at a University of Califor\u00ad nia campus. Approximately 1 percent of the graduating class shall be awarded summa cum laude, 3 percent magna cum laude, and 8 percent cum laude, with no more than 12 percent being awarded honors. Other important factors are considered (see page 55). Dean's Honor List. The quarterly Dean's Honor List is composed of students who have received a 3.5 GPA while carrying a mini\u00ad mum of 12 graded units. Excellence in Engineering Research Award.

Additional infor\u00ad mation is available in the Catalogue section entitled Research and Graduate Studies. Admission to graduate standing in the School of Engineering is generally accorded those possessing a B.S. degree in engineering or an allied field obtained with an acceptable level of scholarship from an institution of recognized standing. Those seeking admission without the prerequisite scholarship record may, in some cases, undertake remedial work; if completed at the stipu\u00ad lated academic level, they will be admitted to full graduate stand\u00ad ing. Those admitted from an allied field may be required to take supplementary upper-division courses in basic engineering subjects. The Graduate Record Examination General Test is required of all applicants. FINANCIAL SUPPORT Teaching assistantships and fellowships are available to qualified applicants (who should contact the Department to which they are applying for information). Research assistantships are available through individual faculty members. It is beneficial for applicants to contact the faculty member directly to establish the potential for research support. Early applications have a superior chance for financial support. PART-TIME STUDY Those students who are employed may pursue the M.S. degree on a part-time basis, carrying fewer units per quarter. Since University residence requirements necessitate the successful completion of a minimum number of units in graduate or upper-division work in each of at least three regular University quarters, part-time students should seek the advice of the graduate counselor in the School of Engineering and the approval of the chair of their program. M.S. programs must be completed in four calendar years from the date of admission. Students taking courses in University Extension should consult the section on Transfer of Courses below. TRANSFER OF COURSES Upon petition, a limited number of graduate-level courses taken through University Extension, on another campus of the Univer\u00ad sity, or in another accredited university may be credited toward the M.S. degree after admission. With the exception of work under\u00ad taken in another graduate division of the University of California, transfer credit will not be applied to the minimum required units in 200-series courses.

Sirignano: Combustion, pollutant formation, fire spread, noise suppression Thomas K. Wood: Bioremediation of chlorinated aliphatics and aromatics using both natural and genetically engineered microorganisms, biological reactors for site remediation Environmental Engineering addresses the development of strate\u00ad gies to control anthropogenic emissions of pollutants to the atmos\u00ad phere, waterways, and terrestrial environment; the remediation of polluted natural systems; the design of technologies to treat waste; \u00b7 fire safety; noise suppression; energy efficiency; and the evaluation of contaminant fate in urban environments. Environmental engi\u00ad neering issues are now an important component in the development of many engineering technologies and consequently are an impor\u00ad tant aspect of an engineering education. The discipline itself is interdisciplinary and requires a curriculum that provides students with an understanding of fundamentals in air-and water-quality sciences, contaminant fate and transport, and design concepts fot pollutant emission control and treatment. To avoid the develop\u00ad ment of environmental engineering solutions which only transform one form of pollution to another, modern engineering education programs must require exposure and familiarity with a greater number of subjects than ever before. Environmental engineers with an interdisciplinary background are particularly sought to address the complex infrastructure needs of today's society, where they must be able to communicate with teams of scientists and engineers from different disciplines. Envi\u00ad ronmental engineering graduates who meet this description can expect to remain in strong demand in the private and public employment sectors, and their range of career opportunities is highly diverse. Examples of career fields and activities include the development of new technologies to genetically engineer microor\u00ad ganisms for waste treatment, design of combustion and control processes that minimize pollutant emissions and maximize energy efficiency, resolution of complex pollutant transport processes in naturally heterogeneous systems, development of new physical\u00ad chemical treatment approaches, and characterization of pollutant transformation mechanisms in natural systems. Curricular and research subjects of interest in Environmental Engi\u00ad neering include environmental air and water chemistry, environ\u00ad mental microbiology, combustion technologies, aerosol science, transport phenomena, reactor theory, unit operations and systems design, mathematical modeling, energy systems, soil physics, fluid UC IRVINE - 1996-1997mechanics, hydrology, and meteorology. Interdisciplinary research endeavors commonly bridge many of these different subjects and a current focus is maintained on new and emerging technologies. Curriculum objectives have also been set to maintain a balance between the depth and breadth of program scope for each student. Programs of study leading to the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in Engi\u00ad neering are offered. Required Background The interdisciplinary nature of the program allows students with a variety of backgrounds to undertake studies in this field. Students with a background in engineering-particularyly chemical, civil, environmental, and mechanical engineering-as well as scientists from biology, chemistry, environmental science, and physics, are encouraged to participate. Students admitted to the program are expected to have had rigor\u00ad ous undergraduate exposure to a number of relevant subject areas including air quality, environmental chemistry, fluid mechanics, microbial processes, and reactor theory and design. The degree to which each student meets the program's background requirement is determined by participating faculty at the time of adrilission. Stu\u00ad dents with an insufficient background who are offered admission will be required to take a set of appropriate prerequisite courses. Prerequisite work typically involves at least two and frequently as many as five or six upper-division, undergraduate courses each of which must be completed with a final grade of B or better. Occa\u00ad sionally, lower-division work in chemistry, mathematics, or physics is required. The student's specific prerequisite course work require\u00ad ment, if any, is stated the letter of admission. The background requirement establishes a common foundation for graduate study in the program. Not all students are required to take prerequisite course work; those who are may do so following matriculation in the graduate program. In addition, M.S. students may use a limited amount of upper-division course work taken to meet the background requirement in partial fulfillment of graduate degree requirements. Although this list is not exhaustive, commonly required prerequi\u00ad site courses within each of the required background areas are as follows: Air Quality: Engineering MEllO, ME162, or ME164 ME130A Reactor Theory and Design: Engineering ChE160 Core Requirement Students must complete an advanced mathematics course, either Engineering BE220 (Applied Chemical Engineering Mathematics), CE283 (Mathematical Methods in Engineering Analysis), or ME200B (Engineering Analysis II). . Areas of Emphasis Each student selects a primary area of emphasis within Environ\u00ad mental Engineering: Water Quality, Water Resources, or Air Qual\u00ad ity and Combustion. To achieve the interdisciplinary objectives of the program, students are required to take at least two electives outside their primary area, one each in two different areas. These outside electives may also be taken from approved courses in other academic units, including the Schools of Social Ecology and Phys\u00ad ical Science, and the College of Medicine. Electives within each of the emphasis areas in Engineering are listed below. Water Quality: Engineering BE230 (Transport Phenomena), BE240 (Bioengineering with Recombinant (Colloid Transport Phenomena I, II), CE263 (Water and Waste Treatment Engineering 159 Technology), CE264 (Chemical Equilibria in Natural Waters), CE265 (Chemical Dynamics in Natural Waters), CE266 (Aqueous Geochemistry), CE269 (Hazardous Waste Remediation). Water Resources: (Unsaturated Flow in Soils), CE272 (Groundwater Hydrology), CE274 (Transport Air Quality and Combustion: Engineering ME210 (Advanced Fun\u00ad damentals of Combustion), ME215 (Advanced Combustion Technol\u00ad ogy), ME233A, B (Numerical Methods in Heat, Mass, and Momen\u00ad tum Transport), ME230A (Advanced Incompressible Fluid Dynamics I), ME231 (Fundamentals of Turbulence), ME232 (Atmospheric Turbulence), ME260 (Issues Related to Atmospheric Processes), ME261 (Air Pollution Modeling), ME264 (Combustion Particulates and Aerosols), ME280 (Digital Data Acquisition and Analysis). MASTER OF SCIENCE DEGREE Two options are available for M.S. degree students: a thesis option and a comprehensive examination option. Both options require the completion of 36 units of study. Study plans for both options must also include two graduate courses from outside the student's pri\u00ad mary area of emphasis. Plan I. Thesis Option A thesis option is available to students who prefer to conduct a focused research project. Students selecting this option must com\u00ad plete an original research investigation and a thesis, and obtain approval of the thesis by a thesis committee. Of the 36 required units, at least 20 must be graduate courses (numbered 200-289), including either Engineering BE220, ME200B, or CE283. A maxi\u00ad mum of eight M.S. research units and up to eight units \u00b7of upper\u00ad division undergraduate elective courses may be applied to the degree with the approval of a faculty advisor. Plan II. Comprehensive Examination Option Alternatively, students may select a comprehensive examination option in which they must successfully complete 36 units of study and pass a comprehensive examination. At least 24 units must be graduate courses (numbered 200-289), including either Engineer\u00ad ing BE220, ME200B, or CE283. Up to 12 units may be taken as upper-division undergraduate elective courses. DOCTOR OF PHILOSOPHY DEGREE The Ph.D. concentration ih Environmental Engineering requires the achievement of original and significant research that advances the discipline. Doctoral students are selected on the basis of an out\u00ad standing record of scholarship and potential for research excellence. The doctoral study program is tailored to the individual student in consultation with a faculty advisory committee. There are no spe\u00ad cific course requirements, however, additional mathematics courses beyond those required for a M.S. degree are generally required, reflecting the student's specific research interests. Milestones to be passed include: admission to the Ph.D. program by the faculty, passage within the first year of a preliminary examination or simi\u00ad lar assessment of the student's background and potential for suc\u00ad cess, research preparation, formal advancement to candidacy by passing a qualifying examination, completion of a significant research investigation, and the submission and oral defense of an acceptable dissertation. Committees for preliminary and Ph.D. qualifying examinations and the doctoral committee must have at least one Environmental Engi\u00ad neering faculty member from outside the student's area of emphasis. The student's dissertation topic must be approved by the student's UC IRVINE - 1996-1997I 160 UCI 1996-97 School of Engineering doctoral committee. The degree is granted upon the recommenda\u00ad tion of the doctoral committee and the Dean of Graduate Studies. Doctoral programs must be completed within seven calendar years of the date of admission.

Wolfenstine: Mechanical behavior, kinetic properties, processing of ceramics materials Materials Science and Engineering is concerned with the genera\u00ad tion and application of knowledge relating the composition, struc\u00ad ture, and processing of materials to their properties and applica\u00ad tions. During the past two decades, the field has become an important component of modern engineering education, partly because of the increased level of sophistication required of engi\u00ad neering materials in a rapidly changing technological society, and partly because the selection of materials has increasingly become an integral part of almost every modern engineering design. In fact, further improvements in design are now viewed more and more as primarily a materials issue. Both the development of new materials and the understanding of present-day materials demand a thorough knowledge of basic engineering and scientific principles including, for example, crystal structure, mechanics, mechanical behavior, electronic, optical and magnetic behavior, thermodynam\u00ad ics, phase equilibria, heat transfer, diffusion, and the physics and chemistry of solids. The field of Materials Science and Engineering ranks high on the list of top careers for scientists and engineers. The services of these engineers and scientists are required in a variety of engineering operations dealing, for example, with design of semiconductors and optoelectronic devices, development of new technologies based on composites and high-temperature superconductivity, bio\u00ad medical products, performance (quality, reliability, safety, energy efficiency) in automobile and aircraft components, improvement in nondestructive testing techniques, corrosion behavior in refineries, radiation damage in nuclear power plants, and fabrication of steels. Subjects of interest in the field cover a wide spectrum, ranging from metals and optical and electronic materials to superconduc\u00ad tive materials, ceramics, advanced composites, and biomaterials. In addition, the emerging new research and technological areas in materials are in many cases interdisciplinary. Accordingly, the principal objective of the graduate curriculum is to integrate a stu\u00ad dent's area of emphasis-whether it be structural materials, chemi\u00ad cal processing, mechanics of solids, or electronic devices-into the whole of material science and engineering. Such integration will breed familiarity with other disciplines and provide the students with the breadth they need to face the challenges of current and future technology. Programs of study leading to the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in Engi\u00ad neering are offered. Recommended Background Given th~ nature of Materials Science and Engineering as a cross\u00ad disciplinary program, students having a background and suitable training in either Materials, Engineering (Mechanical, Electrical, Civil, Chemical), or the Physical Sciences (Physics, Chemistry, Geology) are encouraged to participate. Recommended background courses include an introduction to materials, thermodynamics, mechanical behavior, and electricaUopticaUmagnetic behavior. A student with an insufficient background may be required to take remedial undergraduate courses. Core Requirement Because of the interdepartmental nature of the concentration, it is important to establish a common foundation in Materials Science and Engineering for students from various backgrounds. This foun\u00ad dation is limited to comprehensive materials science topics and is covered in the three core courses: MSE200, MSE205, and MSE210. Areas of Emphasis Each student selects an area of emphasis within Materials Science and Engineering: Electronic and Photonic Materials, Structural Materials, Mechanics of Solids, or Chemical Processing of Materi\u00ad als. Students select specific course requirements within the areas of emphasis in consultation with the program director and their faculty advisor. Typical examples follow. Chemical Processing: Engineering BE210 (Chemical Engineering Thermodynamics), BE230 (Transport Phenomena), BE260 (Reac\u00ad tion Engineering), BE280 (Fundamentals of Phase Transformations). Electronic and Photonic Materials: .Engineering ECE217 A (Advanced Semiconductor Devices I), ECE217B (Advanced Semi\u00ad conductor Devices II), ECE275A (Electrooptical Devices). Mechanics of Solids: Engineering CE242 (Continuum Mechanics), CE243 (Mechanics of Composite Material), CE281 (Finite Element Method in Continuum Mechanics). Structural Materials: Engineering ME200A or 200B (Engineering Analysis), ME251A (Dislocation Theory), ME252A (Diffusion Theory), ME253 (Kinetic Phenomena in Materials), ME254A (Mechanical Behavior of Engineering Materials), ME255 (Ceramic Materials), ME256A (Fracture of Engineering Materials), ME259A (Electron Microscopy). MASTER OF SCIENCE DEGREE A minimum of 36 approved units is required for the M.S. degree. Two options are available, a thesis option and a courses only option. The thesis option requires a research study of greater depth and originality than the courses option. For the thesis option, stu\u00ad dents are required to develop and obtain approval for a complete program of study. A committee of three full-time faculty members is appointed to guide development of the thesis. At least 21 units must be from courses numbered 200-289, among which nine units are from MSE core courses and 12 units are in an area of emphasis approved by the faculty advisor and the graduate advisor. Up to eight units of Engineering ME296 or ECE296 and up to eight units of undergraduate elective courses can be applied toward the 36-unit requirement. For the courses only option, at least 24 units must be from courses numbered 200-289, among which nine units are from MSE core courses and 15 units are in an area of emphasis approved by the faculty advisor and the graduate advisor. Up to UC IRVINE - 1996-1997eight units of undergraduate elective courses can be applied toward the 36-unit requirement. DOCTOR OF PHILOSOPHY DEGREE The Ph.D. concentration in Materials Science and Engineering requires a commitment on the part of the student to dedicated study and collaboration with the faculty. Ph.D. students are selected on the basis of outstanding demonstrated potential and scholarship. Applicants must hold the appropriate prerequisite degrees from recognized institutions of high standing. After sub\u00ad stantial preparation, Ph.D. candidates work under the supervision of faculty advisors. The process involves extended immersion in a research atmosphere and culminates in the production of original rese:rrch results presented in a dissertation. Milestones to be passed in the Ph.D. program include the follow\u00ad ing: acceptance into a research group by the faculty advisor during the student's first year of study; successful completion of the Ph.D. preliminary examination; preparation for doing research, comple\u00ad tion of the School of Engineering teaching requirements, and the development of a research proposal; passing the qualifying exami\u00ad nation which assesses the candidate's preparation for research and evaluates the proposed research; successful completion of the research; development and approval of the dissertation; presenta\u00ad tion of the dissertation and a final examination on its contents. There is no foreign language requirement. The preliminary examination, to be taken in the fall of the second year of the Ph.D. program, is based on the MSE core courses and courses taken in the area of emphasis. The examination committee is appointed by the program director with subsequent approval by the Chair of the appropriate department of the area of emphasis. The degree is granted upon the recommendation of the doctoral committee and the Dean of Graduate Studies. The program must be completed within seven calendar years of the date of admission.

It serves a variety of processing industries whose vast array of products include chemicals, petroleum products, plastics, pharmaceuticals, foods, textiles, fuels, consumer products, and electronic and cryogenic materials. It also serves society to improve the environment by reducing and eliminating pollution. Chemical engineering is an engineering discipline that has its strongest ties with the molecular sciences. This is an important asset since sciences such as chemistry, molecular biology, biomedi\u00ad cine, and solid-state physics are providing the seeds for future technologies. Chemical engineering has a bright future as the disci\u00ad pline which will bridge science with engineering in multidiscipli\u00ad nary environments. Biochemical Engineering is concerned with the processing of bio\u00ad logical materials and processes that use biological agents such as living cells, enzymes, or antibodies. Biochemical Engineering, with integrated knowledge of the principles of biology and chemi\u00ad cal engineering, plays a major engineering role in the rapidly developing area of biotechnology. Career opportunities in Bio\u00ad chemical Engineering are available in a variety of industries such as biotechnology, chemical, environmental, food, petrochemical, and pharmaceuticalindustries. The principle objectives of the graduate curriculum in Chemical and Biochemical Engineering are to develop and expand students' abilities to solve new and more challenging engineering problems and to promote their skills in independent thinking and learning in preparation for careers in manufacturing, research, or teaching. These objectives are reached through a program of course work and research designed by each student with the assistance, advice, and approval of a primary faculty advisor and a faculty advisory committee. Programs of study leading to the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in Chemical and Biochemical Engineering are offered. Graduate study and research in materials includes investigations of materials processing, composite materials, creep, fracture and fatigue, ceramics, and superplasticity. UC IRVINE - 1996-1997Several faculty in the Department are also members of the graduate program in Protein Engineering, which is described in the School of Biological Sciences section of the Catalogue. MASTER OF SCIENCE DEGREE Two plans are available for the M.S. degree: a thesis option and a course work option. Opportunities are available for part-time study toward the M.S. degree. Students who enter the program with a B.S. degree in chemical engineering must take at least six graduate-level courses (22 units), while students who enter without undergraduate preparation in chemical engineering are required to take three to five additional prerequisite courses (Mathematics 105A-B-C and Engineering ChE60, ChE120A, ChE160, and ChE165.) A detailed program of study for each entering student is formulated in consultation with a faculty advisor. Plan 1: Thesis Option The thesis option requires completion of 38 units of study (eight of which can be taken for study in conjunction with the thesis research topic); the completion of an original research project; the writing of the thesis describing it; and successful defense of the thesis. Plan II: Course Work Option The course work option requires the completion of 39-40 units of study, of which 31-32 must be nonresearch, graduate-level courses. DOCTOR OF PHILOSOPHY DEGREE The doctoral program is tailored to the individual needs and back\u00ad ground of the student. The detailed program of study for each Ph.D. student is formulated in consultation with an advisory com\u00ad mittee which takes into consideration the objectives and prepara\u00ad tion of the candidate. The program of study must be approved by the faculty of the School. There are no specific course requirements, but there are several milestones to be passed: three courses (9 to 12 units) beyond those required for the M.S. program, acceptance into a research group by the faculty advisor, successful completion of the Ph.D. preliminary examination, formal advancement to candidacy by passing the qualifying examination which assesses the candidate's preparation for research and evaluates the proposed original research, success\u00ad ful completion of the research, and presentation and successful defense of the dissertation. There is no foreign language require\u00ad ment. Ph.D. students have to meet departmental research require\u00ad ments as a research assistant or equivalent, with or without salary. The degree is granted upon the recommendation of the Doctoral Committee and the Dean of Graduate Studies. For at least the final two years of the doctoral program it is expected that the student will be a full-time resident in the School. Doctoral programs must be completed in seven calendar years from the date of admission.

The success of this endeavor is evident all around us. The inhospitable arid plain which greeted the early settlers in Southern California has been transformed into a thriving metropolis largely by the application of civil engineering. The goal of the Civil Engineering curriculum is to prepare gradu\u00ad ates for a career in practice, research, or teaching. At the under\u00ad graduate level a common core of fundamental subjects is provided, and students are required to specialize in their senior year. Special\u00ad izations are offered in Environmental, Structural, Transportation, and Water Resources Engineering. Graduate opportunities are in three major thrust areas: structural analysis, design, and reliability; transportation systems engineering; and water resources and envi\u00ad ronmenta.l engineering. UC IRVINE - 1996-1997I 166 UCI 1996-97 School of Engineering The career opportunities in civil engineering are varied as in any other discipline. Graduates may look forward to long-term careers in major corporations, public bodies, the military, private consult\u00ad ing firms, or to being self-employed in private practice. History has shown a civil engineering education to be a good ground for many administrative and managerial positions. Environmental Engineering involves designing environmental protection or remediation strategies for multiple resources-water, air, and soil, often with combinations of physical, chemical, and biological treatment methods in the context of a complex regula\u00ad tory framework. The goal of the Environmental Engineering curriculum is to pre\u00ad pare graduates with a strong basic science background, particularly in chemistry and biology, and to provide students with a broad exposure to several environmental engineering science disciplines. Courses relating to transport processes, water quality control, air quality control, and process design are included in the core. Career opportunities in environmental engineering are diverse. Graduates generally find careers related to pollution control and the remediation of air, water, and soil environments. Undergraduate Major in Civil Engineering The program objective is to prepare civil engineering graduates for a career in the profession or for entry into graduate school. The curriculum provides the opportunity to obtain a firm foundation in engineering science and to develop the techniques of analysis and design, which are basic for the successful practitioner. Emphasis is placed on developing problem-solving skills. ADMISSIONS High School Students: See page 154. Transfer Students.

Graduate Study in Civil Engineering Civil Engineering addresses the technology of constructed environ\u00ad ments and, as such, embraces a wide range of intellectual endeav\u00ad ors. The Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering focuses its graduate study and research program on three areas: structural engineering, including aspects of structural dynamics, earthquake engineering, and reliability and risk assessment; trans\u00ad portation systems engineering, including traffic operations and management, expert systems applications, travel behavior, and transportation systems analysis; and water resources and environ\u00ad mental engineering, including water resources, contamination man\u00ad agement, and pollution control technologies. Programs of study leading to the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in Civil Engineering are offered. MASTER OF SCIENCE DEGREE The M.S. degree reflects achievement of an advanced level of competence for the professional practice of civil engineering. Two plans are available to those working toward the M.S. degree: a the\u00ad sis option and a course work option. Opportunities are available for part-time study toward the M.S. degree. Plan 1: Thesis Option The thesis option requires completion of 36 units of study (eight of which can be taken for study in conjunction with the thesis research topic); the completion of an original research project; the writing of the thesis describing it; and presentation of the thesis UC IRVINE - 1996-1997168 UCI 1996-97 School of Engineering research findings in a public seminar. Of the 36 units, a minimum of 20 units must be in nonresearch, graduate-level courses. Plan II: Course Work Option The course work option requires the completion of 36 units of study, at least 30 of which must be in nonresearch graduate-level courses. The remaining six units may be earned as graduate-level course work, individual research, or upper-division undergraduate units. DOCTOR OF PHILOSOPHY DEGREE The Ph.D. degree indicates attainment of an original and signifi\u00ad cant research contribution to the state-of-the-art in the candidate's field, and an ability to communicate advanced engineering con\u00ad cepts. The doctoral program is tailored to the individual needs and background of the student. The detailed program of study for each Ph.D. student is formulated in consultation with an advisory com\u00ad mittee which takes into consideration the objectives and prepara\u00ad tion of the candidate. The program of study must be approved by the faculty of the Department. There are no specific course requirements, but there are several milestones to be passed: admission to the Ph.D. program by the faculty; early assessment of the student's research potential (this includes a preliminary examination), research preparation, formal advancement to candidacy by passing the qualifying examination, completion of a significant research investigation, and the submis\u00ad sion and oral defense of an acceptable dissertation. The prelimi\u00ad nary examination is required of each student and must be taken prior to the start of the fourth quarter of residency in the Ph.D. pro\u00ad gram. The examination may be repeated, but must be passed prior to the start of the seventh quarter of residency. There is no foreign language requirement. Ph.D. students have to meet departmental research requirements as a research assistant or equivalent, with or without salary. The degree is granted upon the recommendation of the Doctoral Committee and the Dean of Graduate Studies. For at least the final two years of the doctoral program it is expected that the student will be a full-time resident in the School. Doctoral pro\u00ad grams must be completed in seven calendar years from the date of admission. THE INSTITUTE OF TRANSPORTATION STUDIES The Institute of Transportation Studies at Irvine (ITS) is part of a multicampus research unit of the University of California. Several faculty studying transportation systems engineering in the Depart\u00ad ment of Civil and Environmental Engineering participate in the Institute. Students choosing to focus their studies in transportation will find strong interdisciplinary opportunities between the Depart\u00ad ment and ITS.

Santina: Control systems Electrical and Computer Engineering is a broad field encompassing such diverse subject areas as computers, control, electronics, digi\u00ad tal systems, communications, signal processing, electromagnetics, and physics of electronic devices. Knowledge of the mathematical and natural sciences is applied to the theory, design, and imple\u00ad mentation of devices and systems for the benefit of society. Some electrical engineers focus on the study of behavior of elec\u00ad tronic devices and circuits that are the basic building blocks of complex electronic systems. Others study the generation, transmis\u00ad sion, and utilization of electrical energy. A large group of electrical engineers studies the application of these complex systems to other areas, including medicine, biology, geology, and ecology. Still another group studies the behavior of complex electronic systems such as computers, automatic controls, telecommunications, and signal processing. Of this latter group, those engaged in designing a variety of electronic computers and computer-based application systems are often called computer engineers. The undergraduate curriculum in Electrical Engineering provides a solid foundation for future career growth, enabling graduates' careers to grow technically, administratively, or both. Many electri\u00ad cal engineers will begin work in a large organizational environ\u00ad ment as members of an engineering team, obtaining career satisfac\u00ad tion from solving meaningful problems that contribute to the success of the organization's overall goal. As their careers mature, technical growth most naturally results from the acquisition of an advanced degree and further development of the basic thought processes instilled in the undergraduate years. Administrative growth can result from the development of management skills on the job and/or through advanced degree programs in management. The undergraduate curriculum in Computer Engineering addresses the design and analysis of digital computers, including both soft\u00ad ware and hardware. Computer design includes topics such as com\u00ad puter architecture, VLSI circuits, design automation, system soft\u00ad ware, and data structures and algorithms. Computer Engineering courses include programming in high-level languages such as Pas\u00ad cal, C, FORTRAN; use of software packages for analysis and design; design of system software such as editors, compilers, debuggers, and operating systems; and application of computers in solving engineering problems. Laboratories in both hardware and software experiences are integrated within the curriculum. Graduates of Computer Engineering will find a variety of career opportunities. The information technology areas include computer hardware and software design, design of computer-based control systems, application software, artificial intelligence, data storage and retrieval, graphics, pattern recognition, computer modeling, parallel computing, and operating systems. UC IRVINE - 1996-1997I 17 4 UCI 1996-97 School of Engineering Undergraduate Major in Computer Engineering The undergraduate Computer Engineering curriculum includes a core of mathematics, physics, and chemistry.

Graduate Study in Electrical and Computer Engineering The Department offers M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in Electrical and Computer Engineering with concentrations in Computer Engineer\u00ad ing and in Electrical Engineering. The Computer Engineering con\u00ad centration covers VLSI design, architectures, and systems. The Electrical Engineering concentration includes optical and solid\u00ad state devices, and systems engineering and signals processing. Because most graduate courses are not repeated every quarter, stu\u00ad dents should make every effort to begin their graduate program in the fall. MASTER OF SCIENCE DEGREE GENERAL REQUIREMENTS The Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering offers two plans for the M.S. degree: a thesis option and a comprehensive examination option. For both options, students are required to develop and obtain approval by the Department's graduate advisor of a complete program of study. Opportunities are available for part-time study toward the M.S. degree. The program of study must be completed within four calendar years from the date of admission. Plan 1: Thesis Option The thesis option requires completion of 36 units of study; the completion of an original research investigation; the writing of the thesis describing it; and approval of the thesis by a thesis commit\u00ad tee. Required undergraduate courses and seminar courses such as ECE294 and ECE295 may not be counted toward the 36 units. No more than four units of ECE299 and three units of undergraduate electives may be counted. The thesis option is available for those graduate students who might best benefit from intense concentration on a specific prob\u00ad lem. A committee of three full-time faculty members is appointed to guide development of the thesis and, to approve it. Plan II: Comprehensive Examination Option The comprehensive examination option requires the completion of 36 units. Students must take four courses among the concentration core courses (see listings under Computer Engineering and Electri\u00ad cal Engineering concentrations) and a coherent set of courses in a UC IRVINE - 1996-1997I 176 UCI 1996-97 School of Engineering specialization approved by their faculty advisor. In addition to the University's grade-point-average requirements, each of the core courses taken must be completed with a grade of B or better. Required undergraduate courses and seminar courses such as ECE294 and ECE295 may not be counted toward the 36 units. No more than three units of ECE299 and six units of undergraduate electives may be counted. All M.S. students with the comprehensive examination option are required to enroll in the weekly departmental seminar, ECE294, for at least two quarters. DOCTOR OF PHILOSOPHY DEGREE GENERAL REQUIREMENTS The doctoral program in Electrical and Computer Engineering is tailored to the individual needs and background of the student. The detailed program of study for each Ph.D. student is formulated in consultation with an advisory committee which takes into consid\u00ad eration the objectives and preparation of the candidate. The pro\u00ad gram of study must be approved by the faculty of the Department. There are several milestones to pass: admission to the Ph.D. pro\u00ad gram by the faculty; within one year of arrival on the campus, pas\u00ad sage of a preliminary examination on the student's background and potential for success in the doctoral program; meeting departmen\u00ad tal teaching requirements which can be satisfied through service as a teaching assistant or equivalent; research preparation; develop\u00ad ment of a research proposal; formal advancement to candidacy through qualifying examination conducted on behalf of the Irvine division of the Academic Senate; completion of a significant research investigation, and completion and approval of a disserta\u00ad tion. Four quarters of ECE294 must be completed. There is no for\u00ad eign language requirement. Ph.D. students have to meet depart\u00ad mental research requirements as a research assistant or equivalent, with or without salary. The degree is granted upon the recommen\u00ad dation of the Doctoral Committee and the Dean of Graduate Stud\u00ad ies. For at least the final two years of the doctoral program it is expected that the student will be a full-time resident in the School. Doctoral programs must be completed in seven calendar years from the date of admission. The Ph.D. preliminary examination contains two parts: a depth examination administered at the end of the first year of doctoral study by faculty in the student's area of specialization; and, pre\u00ad ceding it, a breadth examination consisting of the General Record Examination Subject Test in one of several areas (see listings under Computer Engineering and Electrical Engineering concentrations). The results of the Subject Test must be made available to the fac\u00ad ulty prior to the end of the winter quarter of the student's first year of study in the doctoral program. The Ph.D. preliminary examina\u00ad tion may be repeated once. COMPUTER ENGINEERING CONCENTRATION Computer engineering is concerned with the set of engineering principles which are used for design and construction of informa\u00ad tion-processing systems. The engineering design procedures are based on both the computational principles and theories discovered in the field of computer science and new highly integrated compo\u00ad nent devices made by electrical engineers. Computer engineers are concerned with design constraints such as cost, performance, relia\u00ad bility, size, and power consumption. The main research activities of the faculty that are related to computer engineering are in the areas of fault-tolerant computing, parallel and distributed computer systems, ultra-reliable real-time computer systems, VLSI architec\u00ad tures, computer design automation, numerical processing, com\u00ad puter graphics, intelligent management, and computer communica\u00ad tion networks. In addition to the general departmental requirements, the following requirements must be met. Master of Science Degree Plan 1: Thesis Option Four out of five Computer Engineering core courses must be com\u00ad pleted with a grade of B or better. Three additional Computer Engineering concentration courses must be completed. With approval of the thesis advisor and the Department's graduate advi\u00ad sor, two of these courses may be non-seminar graduate courses outside of the Computer Engineering concentration list. These courses must be related to the student's thesis topic. No more than 12 units of ECE296 (M.S. Thesis Research) may be counted toward the degree. Two quarters of ECE294 must be completed. Plan II: Comprehensive Examination Option A minimum of seven Computer Engineering concentration courses of which four are core courses must be completed. A minimum of three additional non-seminar graduate courses are required.

To achieve their goals, mechanical engi\u00ad neers use mathematics, physics, and chemistry together with engi\u00ad neering science and technology in areas such as fluid mechanics, heat transfer, dynamics, controls, and atmospheric science. Mechanical Engineering students at UCI learn the problem-solv\u00ad ing, modeling, and testing skills required to contribute to advances in modern technology. Mechanical Engineering undergraduates complete required courses that provide engineering fundamentals and technical electives that allow students to study particular areas of interest. Specializations are available in: Aerospace Engineering, Combustion/Propulsion, Environmental Engineering, Heat Transfer/Fluid Mechanics, Mate\u00ad rials Science and Engineering, and Mechanical Systems. Indepen\u00ad dent research opportunities allow students to pursue other avenues for focusing their studies. Since mechanical engineering covers a wide spectrum of subjects, many students use the undergraduate curriculum as preparation for further studies in engineering or in areas such as medicine, law, and management. Aerospace Engineering deals with all aspects of aircraft and space\u00ad craft design and operation, thus requiring the creative use of many different disciplines. Aerospace engineers work on the forefront of technological advances and are likely to be leaders in scientific discoveries. The undergraduate curriculum in Aerospace Engineering includes courses in subsonic and supersonic aerodynamics, propulsion, con\u00ad trols and performance, light-weight structures, and advanced mate\u00ad rials. In the senior capstone course, students work in teams on the preliminary design of a commercial jet transport. Career opportunities for Aerospace Engineering graduates are in the broad range of aerospace industries, including manufacturers of aircraft, spacecraft, engines, and aircraft/spacecraft components; makers of aircraft/spacecraft simulators; and government research laboratories. Areas of graduate study and research are the thermal and fluid sci\u00ad ences, combustion and propulsion, mechanical systems and robot\u00ad ics, environmental engineering, and aerospace engineering. Appli\u00ad cation areas in mechanical engineering include combustion, heat engines, refrigeration, and robotics. Application areas in aerospace engineering include propulsion, aerodynamic design, and guidance and control.

Graduate Study in Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering The Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering faculty have special interest and expertise in three thrust areas: systems and design, fluid and thermal sciences, and combustion and propulsion. Sys\u00ad tems and design faculty are studying robust control, parameter identification for flexible space structures, computer-aided design, and robotics-including mechanical design, robot navigation, and coordination of multiple robot systems. Thermal and fluid sciences encompasses multiphase heat transfer and fluid flow, convection, turbulent transfer, atmospheric processes, and supersonic shear flows. Combustion and propulsion research efforts include studies of the processes of fuel-air mixing, turbulent transport, liquid sprays, and the formation of gaseous and solid pollutants in gas, liquid, and coal-fueled combustion systems, including gas turbines, boilers, incinerators, and rockets. Aerospace engineering research efforts combine specialties from each of the three thrust areas as well as study in propulsion, aero\u00ad dynamics, trajectory optimization and guidance, and control of flexible space structures. Programs of study leading to the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering are offered. MASTER OF SCIENCE DEGREE Two plans are available to pursue study toward the M.S. degree: a thesis option and a comprehensive examination option. Opportuni\u00ad ties are available for part-time study toward the M.S. degree. Plan 1: Thesis Option The thesis option requires completion of 36 units of study; the completion of an original research project, the writing of the thesis describing it; and approval of the thesis by a thesis committee. This plan is available for those who wish to gain research experi\u00ad ence or as preparation for study toward the doctoral degree. To complete the required 36 units, students inust complete a minimum of 20 units in graduate courses numbered ME200-289, and 16 units from unrestricted courses of which not more than eight units are in Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering 183 ME296 and not more than five units are in other courses numbered ME291-299. The courses planned for study must be approved by a faculty advisor and the graduate advisor. Plan II: Comprehensive Examination Option The comprehensive examination option requires completion of 36 units of study, 24 units of which must be from graduate courses numbered ME200-289. With a faculty advisor approval, the remaining 12 units can include execution and documentation of a research or design project (which can count for up to seven of the 36 required units). The courses planned for study must be approved by a faculty advisor and by the graduate advisor. DOCTOR OF PHILOSOPHY DEGREE The doctoral program in Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering is tailored to the individual needs and background of the student. The detailed program of study for each Ph.D. student is formulated in consultation with a faculty advisor who takes into consideration the objectives and preparation of the candidate. Within this flexible framework the Department maintains specific guidelines that outline the milestones of a typical doctoral pro\u00ad gram. All doctoral students should consult the Departmental Ph.D. guidelines for program details, but there are several milestones to be passed: admission to the Ph.D. program by the faculty; comple\u00ad tion of six non-research courses beyond M.S. degree requirements; passage of a preliminary examination or similar assessment of the student's background and potential for success in the doctoral pro\u00ad gram; course work; meeting departmental teaching requirements, which can be satisfied through service as a teaching assistant or equivalent; research preparation; formal advancement to candidacy through a qualifying examination conducted on behalf of the Irvine division of the Academic Senate; development of a research pro\u00ad posal; completion of a significant research investigation, and com\u00ad pletion and defense of an acceptable dissertation. There is no for\u00ad eign language requirement. The degree is granted upon the recommendation of the Doctoral Committee and the Dean of Grad\u00ad uate Studies. A program of part-time study is not available for the Ph.D. Doctoral programs must be completed in seven calendar years from the date of admission. Before seeking admission, Ph.D. applicants are encouraged to communicate directly and in some detail with prospective faculty sponsors. The student's objectives and financial resources must coincide with a faculty sponsor's research interests and research support. Financial aid in the form of a teaching assistantship or fel\u00ad lowship may not cover the period of several years required to com\u00ad plete the program. During the balance of the period the student will be in close collaboration with the faculty research advisor.

Clark, Dean (Acting) 101 Humanities Trailer Complex Undergraduate Counseling: (714) 824-5132 Graduate Counseling: (714) 824-4303 World Wide Web: http://www.humanities.uci.edu/ The School of Humanities comprises the three fundamental areas of history, literature, and philosophy, and the intellectual activity of its departments and programs reflects both the discrete concerns of these three basic disciplines and their intersections. By studying and developing linguistic practices (foreign language training, rhetoric, and composition) and cultural know ledges (history, litera\u00ad ture, and philosophy), humanists define the fundamental tech\u00ad niques of communication used by other components of the modern university and the larger society, as well as analyze and question those techniques and the cultural web of beliefs in which they are practiced. In its current configuration at UCI, the School of Humanities brings together its communications and critical func\u00ad tions, its traditional and postmodernist concepts to examine new areas of interest throughout the University and larger society. These interests might be called \"critical literacy.\" The study of crit\u00ad icalliteracy investigates rhetorical techniques and contexts: innov\u00ad ative technologies of communication (the electronic media revolu\u00ad tion) and the multicultural and global conditions of communication (cultural diversity within a democratic society and cultural differ\u00ad ences in a transnational setting). Because language is the humanist's essential tool and the medium of historical record, philosophical speculation, and literary creation and criticism, the School of Humanities places special emphasis on language and training in composition. The campuswide Writing Program is housed in the School of Humanities, as well as distin\u00ad guished programs in creative writing. The School of Humanities also offers programs in over a dozen foreign languages, both classical and modern, and requires that its majors take two years or the equivalent of foreign language study. The pursuit of critical literacy involves analyzing and understand\u00ad ing our immediate culture, and one way to do this is through the study of foreign languages and the cultural systems they entail. We rarely scrutinize or analyze something we know as intuitively as our native language, yet it is by means of this language that we organize and express our thoughts. The \"foreignness\" of a foreign language permits us to objectify an entire linguistic system, to observe its structure and its usage, and then to make comparisons with our own linguistic situation. The knowledge of one's native language, gained by this kind of comparative observation, is the foundation of critical reflection on texts of any nature-historical, philosophical, literary, political, legal, scientific, or other. Serious study of a foreign language is, therefore, crucial to any university education that aims at fostering critical thinking and objective self\u00ad reflection. The School of Humanities requires all its majors to take the Humanities Core Course, which integrates the study of philosophy, literature, and history along with lower-division writing. Interdisci\u00ad plinary studies are also an essential feature of the Humanities Hon\u00ad ors Program, Film Studies, and Comparative Literature, and a number of the campus' Interdisciplinary Programs are affiliated with the School of Humanities. The School also maintains close ties with the School of Social Sciences' Department of Linguistics. Because humanists deal analytically with the most complex prob\u00ad lems and issues affecting people, and because they are especially adept at analyzing language and texts, students majoring in the humanities are particularly well-prepared for careers in all fields in which analysis, judgment, and argument are important. Thus a background in the humanities is advantageous not only for a career in a university or school, but also for careers in such fields as man\u00ad agement, law, medicine, communications, diplomacy, social work, and politics. In a changing world where the terms of employment and professional activity are no longer stable, it is crucial that stu\u00ad dents achieve not only knowledge, but also the skills of analysis and imagination that are fostered by humanistic inquiry and critical literacy.

Honors at Graduation Students are nominated for honors at graduation on the basis of scholarship and special achievements. To be eligible for nomina\u00ad tion the student must, by the end of the winter quarter of the senior year, file an Application for Graduation and meet the following criteria: (1) achieve a UC grade point average of at least 3.50, (2) complete at least 18 courses (72 units) in residence at a UC cam\u00ad pus, and (3) receive strong recommendation from the major depart\u00ad ment. Eligible students are automatically considered for Honors at Graduation. Other important factors are considered (see page 55). HUMANITIES INSTRUCTIONAL RESOURCE CENTER The Humanities Instructional Resource Center (HIRC) provides comprehensive technology support for instruction, research, and faculty and staff development, and serves as the center of innovative technology-mediated instruction within the School of Humanities. HIRC services and facilities include computer laboratories, video editing, video and audiotape libraries, fee-based laser printing, audio production, computing consultation, and technology-related research and development assistance for faculty, graduate, and undergraduate students. The HIRC's Macintosh and AST laboratories provide a wide vari\u00ad ety of instructional resources including, among others, multimedia applications and development stations, foreign language word pro\u00ad cessing and language learning materials, and logic simulations. Both laboratories are connected to a central server and to the cam\u00ad pus backbone for access to the Internet, World Wide Web, Melvyl, and other research resources. The Macintosh laboratory consists of networked Centris 650 machines with CD-ROM drives. Both labo\u00ad ratories are available to Humanities students, instructors, and staff for class instruction and drop-in purposes. UC IRVINE - 1996-1997Additional information may be obtained from the HIRC Computer Consultant's Office, 213 Humanities Hall, telephone (714) 824-8493, or the HIRC main offices, 269 Humanities Hall, tele\u00ad phone (714) 824-6344. Undergraduate Programs In addition to 16 majors and 17 minors, the School also offers a formal concentration in Medieval Studies and courses in Italian and Portuguese. The academic counselors in the Humanities Undergraduate Coun\u00ad seling Office, located in the Humanities Trailer Complex, help all students in planning a program of study. Transfer students in par\u00ad ticular need to consult an academic counselor to determine major requirements. Students who expect to pursue graduate study also should consult with appropriate faculty members to ensure proper preparation. A corps of lower-division advisors is designed to meet the special needs of freshmen and sophomores who are interested in the humanities but who have not chosen a major in the School. The advisors are particularly interested in undergraduate education and are especially knowledgeable about University regulations, require\u00ad ments in and outside the School, course content, options to major, and other matters that may present difficulties. For the first two years, students in Humanities are encouraged to explore the vari\u00ad ous disciplines represented in the School. During that time the lower-division advisor is prepared to help the undeclared student keep options to a major open, plan a coherent program of humanis\u00ad tic study, and reach an eventual decision about the major. Generally each major stipulates a one-year course that is both an introduction to the discipline and a prerequisite to the major itself. Students who plan wisely will construct programs that include a good number of such courses. NOTE: In many undergraduate courses in the School of Humani\u00ad ties, additional meetings between individual students and the instructor may be required. Many courses are composed of both lectures and required discussion sessions. Undergraduate students in the School of Humanities participate in the affairs of the School in a number of ways: by serving on com\u00ad mittees of various departments, by sitting with the faculty in its meetings, by working as peer academic advisors in the Undergrad\u00ad uate Counseling Office, and by serving on the Humanities Council, which directly advises the Dean. HUMANITIES PEER MENTOR PROGRAM The Humanities Peer Mentor Program is designed to address some of the academic, cultural, and social needs of minority students in the School of Humanities. The Program features two-tiered men\u00ad toring, with successful upper-division students mentoring small groups of new students, and the student mentors in turn working with faculty and staff. An undergraduate intern coordinates the activities. Another focus of the Program is to encourage and assist student mentors to go on to graduate school. Participants attend workshops on topics such as study skills, library research, time management, and careers, as well as a vari\u00ad ety of social events, and keep journals in which they express their ideas and raise issues for their mentors. Additional information is available from the Humanities Undergraduate Counseling Office; telephone (714) 824-5132. HUMANITIES HONORS PROGRAM 101 Humanities Trailer Complex; (714) 824-5132 Lamar Hill, Director Humanities 189 The Honors Program of the School of Humanities is a two-year, upper-division program designed to challenge superior students from all fields by providing special opportunities for interdiscipli\u00ad nary work within an intellectually charged framework. Small semi\u00ad nars and the opportunity for independent research are some of the advantages offered by the Program, which is open by invitation to all UCI students regardless of their majors. Students in the Program benefit from their involvement in the cam\u00ad pus community of Humanities scholars. They enjoy a close rela\u00ad tionship with the faculty and profit from intense interaction with their intellectual peers. A comprehensive advising program involv\u00ad ing Honors faculty advisors as well as specially trained Honors peer advisors ensures that Humanities Honors students continually receive timely, individualized advice about their academic careers. Formal as well as informal gatherings, including student-organized social activities ranging from coffee hours to theater parties, aug\u00ad ment a wide range of campus activities. Humanities Honors students have the opportunity to become some of the campus' best informed scholars on a broad range of topics: from artificial intelligence to medical ethics, from Shakespeare to Gilbert and Sullivan, from problems of the ancient Near East to the dilemmas of modernity. Humanities Honors students complete a two-part course of study. In their junior year, students take three quarters of an interdiscipli\u00ad nary Proseminar (Humanities Hl20) organized about a single topic or problem, such as crime and punishment, the other, the develop\u00ad ment of religion in the West, the self, nature, or the American dream. The sequence is designed to compare and contrast modes of analysis and critical thinking In history, literary studies, and philos\u00ad ophy. In a small seminar setting, students are encouraged to become reflective about their own chosen disciplines. In their senior year, students take a sequence beginning in the fall with a Senior Honors Seminar (Humanities H140), and continuing in the winter and spring with the Senior Honors Thesis (Humani\u00ad ties Hl41) and the Senior Honors Colloquium (H142), prepared as an independent research project under the direction of a faculty member on a topic chosen by the student. Students present-their theses in an informal gathering with their faculty advisors in the spring, and a prize is awarded for the year's outstanding thesis. In both sequences the Honors students benefit from their close association with exceptional scholars and the challenge and sup\u00ad port of their intellectual peers. Students interested in learning how the Humanities Honors Pro\u00ad gram will fit into their regular courses of study are encouraged to contact the Senior Academic Counselor in Humanities; telephone (714) 824-5132. CENTER FOR INTERNATIONAL EDUCATION The Center for International Education, which includes the Educa\u00ad tion Abroad Program (EAP) and the International Opportunities Program (lOP), assists students in taking advantage of the many worldwide opportunities that exist for study, work, internship, vol\u00ad unteering, and research. School of Humanities majors and minors can benefit from a broader perspective of their fields by studying for one year at a university in such countries as China, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Russia, Spain, or the United Kingdom through EAP. Students can also augment their exposure to other cultures with programs sponsored through lOP. See the Center for International Education section of the Catalogue or an academic counselor for additional information. UC IRVINE - 1996-1997I 190 UCI 1996-97 School of Humanities REQUIREMENTS FOR THE BACHELOR'S DEGREE University Requirements: See pages 57-61. School Requirements Satisfactory completion of the following, which must be taken for letter grades: Humanities lA-B-C, tilken in the freshman year (transfer students may substitute appropriate course work in compo\u00ad sition, literature, history, humanities, and philosophy for the Core Course by permission; apply in the Humanities Undergraduate Counseling Office); two years of work in a single acceptable foreign language, either modem or classical (through 2C), or equivalent competence; quarterly consultation with an assigned advisor and the advisor's written approval for the program of study decided upon. NOTE: Within the beginning and intermediate foreign language instructional sequences (lA-B-C and 2A-B-C, and for Latin and Greek, lA-B-C and 25), students must earn a grade of C or better in order to advance to the next level of instruction. Foreign Language Placement. Students entering UCI with previ\u00ad ous foreign language training are placed as follows: in general, one year of high school work is equated with one quarter of UCI work. Thus, students with one, two, three, or four years of high school foreign language will normally enroll in lB-, lC-, 2A-, or 2B-level language courses, respectively. Exceptions must have the approval of the appropriate course director and the Associate Dean, Under\u00ad graduate Study. Transfer students may not repeat foreign language courses for which they received credit upon matriculation to UCI. Native Speakers of Languages Other Than English. A native speaker of a foreign language, defined by the University as some\u00ad one who attended the equivalent of secondary school in another country where the language of instruction was other than English, may be exempted from taking third-year language study in that language for some majors offered by the School of Humanities. In this case, the student must substitute appropriate upper-division courses in the major to replace the number of exempted courses. For example, if a native speaker of French is exempted from French lOOA and lOOB, that student must replace those two courses with two other upper-division French courses offered by the Department of French and Italian. Repeating Deficient Foreign Language Grades. First-and sec\u00ad ond-year foreign language courses and third-year foreign language composition courses are sequential and each is prerequisite to the next. This is true also of fourth-year Chinese, Japanese, and Russ\u00ad ian. Students wishing to repeat a deficient grade in one of these courses must repeat it prior to continuing on to the next level of the language. A student may not take a lower-level course for credit once a more advanced level has been completed with a pass\u00ad ing grade. Maximum Overlap Between Major Requirements: Students completing double majors within the School of Humanities may count no more than two courses for both majors simultaneously (i.e., a double major in Comparative Literature and Spanish can count only two upper-division Spanish literature courses for both majors). Maximum Overlap Between Major and Minor Requirements: Students completing majors and minors within the School of Humanities may count no more than two courses for both a major and a minor. No course may be counted for two minors. School Residence Requirement: At least five upper-division courses required for each major must be completed successfully at UCI. Completion of a minor program is optional; however, for cer\u00ad tification in a minor, at least four upper-division courses required for the minor must be completed successfully at UCI. See individ\u00ad ual major and minor requirements for specific courses. Exceptions are considered on a case-by-case basis and decided in consultation with the appropriate department or faculty member. Off-campus Internship Policy. In most cases, students are not allowed to earn credit for off-campus internships taken as Indepen\u00ad dent Study in the School of Humanities. However, when the stu\u00ad dent's department or program determines that the internship is aca\u00ad demically appropriate to the student's program and promotes the student's academic goals, credit may be given. A maximum of four units total may be earned for internships; how\u00ad ever, the units may not be counted toward the student's major requirements. The sponsoring department or program and the instructor will in all cases require a substantial academic product, such as a paper, growing out of the internship. A student who wishes to seek approval for an off-campus intern\u00ad ship must file an Independent Study form with the Humanities Undergraduate Study Office prior to beginning the internship. Graduate Programs The School offers a wide program of graduate degrees. Although the Master's degree is offered in most departments, the programs emphasize the Ph.D. and give distinct preference in admission to those students who intend to take that degree. Exceptions are the two-year Master of Fine Arts in English (Creative Writing) and the two-year Master of Arts of Teaching in Spanish. In addition to the seminars offered by the various departments, the School sponsors a number of interdisciplinary seminars annually. These courses are taught by faculty members from various departments. Further, sev\u00ad eral departments offer a few students the opportunity to do part of their work for the Ph.D. in a related discipline. A limited number of students are accepted annually to study for teaching credentials. This program is a cooperative effort between the School and the UCI Department of Education. Graduate students in the School of Humanities participate in the affairs of the School by serving on committees of the various departments and sitting with the faculty in its meetings.

The program is concerned with both the formal structure of the visual arts and their function within society. Students majoring in the history of art thus are UC IRVINE - 1996-1997urged to take appropriate courses in classics, history, philosophy, literature, and in other areas of the arts. All majors also are encour\u00ad aged to study a second language beyond the minimum departmen\u00ad tal requirement of two years in a single foreign language at the University level. The University's Education Abroad Program offers students the opportunity to study abroad. Study centers of particular interest to Art History majors are in Vienna, Venice, Padua, Madrid, Cairo, Jerusalem, Leningrad, Latin America, France, Great Britain, Ire\u00ad land, and Scandinavia. In addition, students focusing in Asian art may be interested in programs in China, India, Korea, Indonesia, Thailand, or Japan; and Chengchi University in Taipei offers a track in English that is devoted to Chinese art and art history. Spe\u00ad cial scholarships are available for Pacific region programs. CAREERS FOR THE ART HISTORY MAJOR A Bachelor's degree in Art History is excellent preparation for pur\u00ad suing either a career as an art historian, art conservator, or museum curator, or professional study in an entirely different discipline. Art History majors have gone on to graduate and professional school to study art history, archaeology, architecture, law, library science, business (in some cases with special focus in the arts), or teacher education. The study of the history of art is a valuable part of a lib\u00ad eral education that provides a means of looking at the history and culture of both the past and the present.

DEPARTMENT OF CLASSICS 156 Humanities Hall; (714) 824-6735 Walter Donlan, Department Chair Faculty Luci Berkowitz, Ph.D. The Ohio State University, Research Professor of Classics (pastoral poetry, literary criticism) Theodore F. Brunner, Ph.D. Stanford University, Research Professor of Classics and Director, Thesaurus Linguae Graecae (computer application to Classical literature, Augustan literature) Cynthia L. Claxton, Ph.D. The University of Washington, Lecturer in Classics (Greek prose, historiography) Walter Donlan, Ph.D. Northwestern University, Depanment Chair and Professor of Classics (early Greek literature and social history) Richard I. Frank, Ph.D. University of California, Berkeley, Associate Professor of History and Classics (Roman history, Classical tradition) B.P. Reardon, D.U. Universite de Nantes, Professor Emeritus of Classics (Late Greek literature, Greek novel) Patrick Sinclair, Ph.D. Northwestern University, Associate Professor of Classics (Latin prose, lexicography) Dana F. Sutton, Ph.D. University of Wisconsin, Professor of Classics (Greek and Latin drama, Greek poetry, Anglo-Latin literature) Undergraduate Program The Department of Classics aims to provide the undergraduate stu\u00ad dent with a working knowledge of the origins and heritage of Greco-Roman civilization. The Department is committed to a twofold purpose: (1) disseminating interest in and knowledge of Classical Civilization through the teaching of Greek and Latin lan\u00ad guage and literature; and (2) helping students, through courses in Classical literature, history, civilization, mythology, and religion taught through English translations, to appreciate the high achieve\u00ad ments of Greek and Roman culture and their pervasive influence on our own civilization. The Department offers both a major in Classics (with an emphasis on Greek, Latin, or Linguistics) and a major in Classical Civiliza\u00ad tion in which most of the required courses are in English transla\u00ad tion. Students are encouraged to consult with the Classics faculty regarding the appropriate choice of major and design of program. For the Classics major, study of the Classics must be based on competence in both Greek and Latin. The Classics program is designed to provide the student with this competence as rapidly as possible, so that by the end of first-year Greek or Latin the student has already been introduced to some of the major Classical authors in the original. From then on, courses are devoted to reading and interpreting the literature of ancient Greece and Rome. In addition to their training in the languages, students gain first-hand knowl\u00ad edge of the literature, history, and thought of the ancient world through the close study of some of its finest writers. The major in Classical Civilization is designed for students who do not plan to concentrate on the Classical languages or pursue gradu\u00ad ate study in the Classics, yet wish to obtain an undergraduate degree based on a sound knowledge of the Classical world. This major requires one year of study (or its equivalent) in either Greek or Latin and a minimum of 10 courses taught in English translation concerning such topics as Classical literature, civilization, history, archaeology, art, drama, and philosophy. The student planning to major in Classics or Classical Civilization should obtain a copy of the brochure, \"Undergraduate Study in Classics,\" available in the Department office. Students entering UCI with previous Greek or Latin training can be given advanced standing. Usually, one year of high school work is equated with one quarter of UCI work. Thus, students with one, two, three, or four years of high school Latin (or Greek) will enroll in Latin (or Greek) 1B, 1C, 25, and 101 respectively. Placement may vary, depending on the extent of the student's preparation. Students with transfer credit for Greek and/or Latin may not repeat those courses for credit. Students with high school training in the Classical languages are encouraged to consult with the Classics staff before enrolling in Classics courses. The Department adheres to the policy of giving its students an opportunity to participate in the departmental decision-making process. Student representatives, elected from and by the under\u00ad graduate majors, participate in all departmental meetings. Repre\u00ad sentatives are responsible for maintaining close liaison with their constituency, for representing the students' interest in curriculum and personnel matters, and for the evaluation of both the academic program and the academic staff. Inquiries regarding ianguage placement, prerequisites, planning a program of study, or other matters related to the Department's offerings should be directed to the Office of the Chair, 156 Human\u00ad ities Hall, telephone (714) 824-6735. Hebrew and Judaic Studies Courses in Hebrew and Judaic Studies were initiated by the Department of Classics in September 1976, through a joint agree\u00ad ment between the School of Humanities and the University of Judaism in Los Angeles. Courses are offered in aspects of Jewish history, philosophy, and literature (Classics 180A-B-C, 181, and 182A-B-C). Through this program the Department of Classics is able to broaden its offerings to include both the Greek and Hebrew contributions to Western civilization. REQUIREMENTS FOR THE BACHELOR'S DEGREE University Requirements: See pages 57-61. School Requirement~: See page 190. Departmental Requirements for Majors Two separate majors: Classics (with an emphasis in Greek, Latin, or Linguistics) and passical Civilization. Classics (Greek emphasis): Greek 1A-B-C; Greek 25; Greek 101-102. Classics (Linguistics emphasis): two possible plans of study.

NOTE: With the permission of the Department, an additional course at the 100 level in the same language may be substituted for Greek or Latin 25. Classical Civilization: Latin (or Greek) lA-B-C, Classics courses; three additional courses in Classical history, Classical philosophy, or Classical art. Residence Requirement for the Major: At least five upper-divi\u00ad sion courses required for the major must be successfully completed at UCI. UC IRVINE - 1996-1997Departmental Requirements for Minors The Department offers minors in Greek, Latin, and Classical Civilization. Greek: Greek 1A-B-C, 25, 101, 102, 105A-B-C. Greek 120 may be substituted for one course at the 100 level. Latin: Latin 1A-B-C, 25, 101, 102, 105A-B-C. Latin 120 may be substituted for one course at the 100 level.

Residence Requirement for the Minor: Four upper-division courses must be successfully completed at UCI. PLANNING A PROGRAM OF STUDY The Department believes in close consultation with students on academic advising and program planning. Students planning to major (or minor) in Classics or Classical Civilization are strongly urged to consult with the departmental faculty at the earliest possi\u00ad ble moment to learn about the various programs. CAREER OPPORTUNITIES The study of the ancient world is a valuable possession for modem life. The discipline of Classics is an important part of a liberal edu\u00ad cation. Greek and Latin language and literature, history and philos\u00ad ophy, mythology and religion make an excellent basis for explor\u00ad ing all periods of Western culture down to the present day. Classics is an interdisciplinary study, exploring human culture by a variety of methods from a variety of points of view. For this reason, the student who chooses to major in Classics or Classical Civilization may find many professional opportunities open. Graduate and professional schools in medicine, law, management, and other fields welcome students with training in the Classics. So do many business corporations. Business, industry, and technology are well acquainted with the value of a Classical education. They are aware that students with a strong background in a respected and challenging major such as Classics are disciplined thinkers who can express themselves in clear, coherent, and cogent lan\u00ad guage, capabilities that are considered valuable in future physi\u00ad cians, lawyers, and managers. There are also specific vocational opportunities open to the gradu\u00ad ate in Classics or Classical Civilization. A major in this field may lead to a career in high school teaching, or (after appropriate fur\u00ad ther study) in college or university teaching. It is also an excellent preparation for advanced study in other academic disciplines such as archaeology, history, comparative literature, philosophy, and lin\u00ad guistics, as well as for theological studies and for work in a wide range of the humanities and social sciences. The Career and Life Planning Center provides services to UCI stu\u00ad dents and alumni including career counseling, information about job opportunities, a career library, and workshops on resume preparation, job search, and interview techniques. See the Career and Life Planning Center section for additional information. The Department of Classics encourages students to take advantage of educational opportunities abroad while making progress toward their UCI degree. Classics and Classical Civilization majors and minors can benefit from a broader perspective of the field by studying for one year at a university in France, Germany, Italy, Spain, or the United Kingdom through the Education Abroad Pro\u00ad gram. Students can also augment their exposure to Greek, Latin, and Classical civilizations by studying for a summer in Greece or Italy at programs sponsored by other UC campuses through the International Opportunities Program. See the Center for Interna\u00ad tional Education section of the Catalogue or your academic coun\u00ad selor for additional information. Classics 195 Graduate Program From the program's inception in 1970, emphasis has been on close attention to each student's progress, together with a relatively high reliance on independent work. Each graduate student is assigned to a faculty preceptor, who monitors student progress in language skills, knowledge of the discipline, competence in research, and experience in teaching. The graduate program is closely connected with the Thesaurus Linguae Graecae research project and the Con\u00ad sortium for Latin Lexicography (the electronic version of the Munich-based Thesaurus Linguae Latinae). These projects afford special opportunities for students interested in computing as a means for research and teaching. The Department offers a Ph.D. program with specializations in Greek or Latin. Except for students with advanced standing, three years (nine quarters) of course work are required. Normal course requirements are four quarters of the core courses, Classics 200A\u00ad B-C and 201; nine quarters of Classics 220; and five quarters of Classics 205. (Classics 280 may be substituted for these courses at the discretion of the Department.) Students are encouraged to take courses and seminars in relevant areas outside the Department. Students must demonstrate reading proficiency in German by the end of the second year and in another modem language (usually French or Italian) by the end of the third year. In order to become a candidate for the Ph.D. and enter the dissertation stage, a student must pass an individually designed set of qualifying examinations consisting of translation examinations in Greek and Latin, written examinations or lengthy papers in special authors and fields, and an oral examination. The normative time for the completion of the Ph.D. is six years. All students entering the Ph.D. program, with the exception of those granted advanced standing because they hold the M.A. degree from another institution, will be concurrently enrolled in the M.A. program. The requirements for the M.A. degree are two years (six quarters) of course work, passage of a special set of examinations, and completion of a paper. The normative time for completion of the M.A. degree is two years. Course work for the M.A. degree normally consists of four quarters of Classics 200A\u00ad B-C and 201; four quarters of Classics 220; and five quarters of Classics 205. (Classics 280 may be substituted for these courses at the discretion of the Department.) A reading knowledge of Ger\u00ad man, demonstrated by examination or other means, is a require\u00ad ment for the M.A. degree. Upon completion of the requirements for the M.A. degree, a student will be permitted to continue in the Ph.D. program only upon a positive vote of a majority of the Clas\u00ad sics faculty. The program puts emphasis on the tradition, methods, and tools of Classical scholarship, with special attention to computer applica\u00ad tion to scholarly research. Students are required to read extensively in the general field of Classics and ancient history, under faculty guidance. Experience in supervised teaching and/or research activ\u00ad ity normally is required. The resources of the program are enhanced through a cooperative teaching arrangement among the Classics graduate programs of the UC campuses at Irvine, Los Angeles, Riverside, San Diego, and Santa Barbara, and the University of Southern California. The pro\u00ad gram has entered into a special arrangement with faculty in Clas\u00ad sics and related disciplines at UC Riverside and UC San Diego, with the future purpose of forming a three-campus joint-degree program in Classics. Thesaurus Linguae Graecae The Thesaurus Linguae Graecae, a unique resource for research in Greek literary and linguistic studies, is closely affiliated with the Department of Classics although it is administratively separate.

East Asian Languages and Literatures 197 DEPARTMENT OF EAST ASIAN LANGUAGES AND LITERATURES 440 Humanities Office Building; (714) 824-2227 Steven D. Carter, Department Chair Faculty Steven D.

Fuller, Ph.D. Yale University, Associate Professor of Chinese (Chinese poetry and poetics, the cultural and intellectual contexts for poetry, aesthetic theory, linguistic issues in classical Chinese) Hu Ying, Ph.D. Princeton University, Assistant Professor of Chinese (narra\u00ad tive literature, translation theory, feminist theory) Martin W. Huang, Ph.D. Washington University, Assistant Professor of Chinese (narrative theories and traditional Chinese fiction) Susan B. Klein, Ph.D. Cornell University, Assistant Professor of Japanese (premodern and modern theater and dance; Japanese religions; feminist critical theory) The curriculum in East Asian Languages and Literatures enables students to understand the extensive and rich literary, historical, social, and aesthetic traditions of East Asia through the intensive study of an East Asian language and of literary texts in translation and in the original language. Students take a total of four years of courses in the modern language, in which comprehension, speak\u00ad ing, reading, and writing are stressed. Studies of texts take place throughout the curriculum: the first three years students read texts in translation and the fourth year they read in the original language. The literature-in-translation courses consist of general introductory overviews as well as more specific topics at the intermediate level for those students whose language proficiency is insufficient to cope with difficult literary texts. At the advanced level, course con\u00ad tent focuses on reading texts in the original language and rotates among significant literary and cultural topics. In these courses, the curriculum integrates the study of East Asian literatures with theo\u00ad retical issues that shape the study of world literature in general. In this way, the student gains the dual perspectives of studying East Asian cultures on their own terms as well as recognizing the affini\u00ad ties these civilizations share with the emerging world culture. CAREERS FOR THE MAJOR Studies in East Asian languages and literatures will give the stu\u00ad dent the intensive linguistic and cultural preparation needed to pur\u00ad sue a career involving these important Pacific Rim nations. In an era in which the United States is seeking to come to grips with the challenges and opportunities presented by this vital area of the world, the training in language and literature offered by the depart\u00ad mental faculty will serve the student well in a variety of endeavors, such as international business, law, government service, journal\u00ad ism, teaching, and other careers involved with public affairs. Undergraduate studies in an EasrAsian language are also a valu\u00ad able preparation for those students intent upon pursuing graduate study in any field of East Asian language or culture. The Career and Life Planning Center provides services to UCI stu\u00ad dents and alumni including career counseling, information about job opportunities, a career library, and workshops on resume preparation, job search, and interview techniques. See the Career and Life Planning Center section for additional information. UC IRVINE - 1996-1997198 UCI 1996-97 School of Humanities Undergraduate Program The Department offers three undergraduate majors: the B.A. degree program in Chinese Language and Literature, the B.A. degree pro\u00ad gram in Japanese Language and Literature, and the B.A. degree program in East Asian Cultures. In addition, minors are offered in Chinese Language and Literature and Japanese Language and Literature. PLANNING A PROGRAM OF STUDY The student and the faculty advisor (assigned upon entering the major) should plan a coherent program that both fulfills the requirements of the major and covers the student's areas of interest in allied fields outside East Asian Languages and Literatures. Students are placed in Chinese, Japanese, and Korean courses according to their years of previous study. In general, one year of high school language taken in the United States is equated with one quarter of UCI work. Thus students with one, two, three, and four years of high school work will most often enroll in levels 1B, 1C, 2A, and 2B, respectively. Students with background in an Asian language gained through primary or secondary school work taken in Asia must consult with the faculty to determine their proper placement level. Those who have gained substantial knowl\u00ad edge of Chinese, Japanese, or Korean either through secondary school work or through college-level language courses may not repeat those courses for credit. Prospective majors who place out of the upper-division language requirement are expected to substi\u00ad tute an equivalent number of other courses to be selected in con\u00ad sultation with their advisor. The faculty encourages students to study abroad, either through the University's Education Abroad Program or independently, after completing at least two years of study (or its equivalent) of the rel\u00ad evant language at UCI. Additional information is available in the Department office. REQUIREMENTS FOR THE BACHELOR'S DEGREE University Requirements: See pages 57-61. School Requirements: See page 190. Departmental Requirements for the Majors Three separate majors: Chinese Language and Literature, Japanese Language and Literature, and East Asian Cultures. Chinese Language and Literature: Completion of Chinese 3C or equivalent; Chinese lOOA-B-C, lOlA-B-C; East Asian Languages and Literatures 190; one course dealing with the literature or cul\u00ad ture of another East Asian country; and at least four additional courses in Chinese literature, history, art history, linguistics, or comparative literature, of which one may be a lower-division East Asian course offered by the Department. Japanese Language and Literature: Completion of Japanese 2C or equivalent; Japanese 3A-B-C, lOOA-B, 101A-B-C; East Asian Languages and Literatures 190; one course dealing with the litera\u00ad ture or culture of another East Asian country; and at least five additional courses in Japanese literature, history, art history, lin\u00ad guistics, or comparative literature, of which one may be a lower\u00ad division East Asian course offered by the Department. East Asian Cultures: Completion of Chinese 3C, Japanese 3C, or East Asian Languages and Literatures (Korean) 3C; two quarters of East Asian Languages and Literatures 155, with different topics; East Asian Languages and Literatures 190; and nine additional upper-division courses, at least three of which must pertain to a country other than the one of language specialization; up to four of these courses may be taken outside the Department, with the approval of the undergraduate advisor. . Residence Requirement for the Majors: At least five upper-divi\u00ad \u00b7sion courses required for the major must be completed successfully at UCI. Students are encouraged, however, to complete up to a year of their language study in approved programs of study abroad. Requirements for the Minors Two separate minors: Chinese Language and Literature and Japan\u00ad ese Language and Literature. \u00b7Chinese Language and Literature: A three-quarter sequence selected from Chinese 3A-B-C, 100A-B-C, or 101A-B-C; and four courses selected from the East Asian Languages and Literatures offerings on Chinese topics and/or the upper-division courses in Chinese. Japanese Language and Literature: Either Japanese 3A-B-C, lOOA-B, or lOlA-B-C; and four courses (or five courses, if the \u00b7lOOA-B sequence has been chosen) selected from the East Asian .Languages and Literatures offerings on Japanese topics and/or the upper-division courses in Japanese. Residence Requirements for the Minors: A minimum of four upper-division courses required for the minor must be successfully completed at UCI. .Graduate Program The Department offers a program of graduate study leading to the Ph.D. degree in East Asian Languages and Literatures, with con\u00ad centrations in Chinese, Japanese, and East Asian Cultural Studies. The M.A. degree may be awarded to Ph.D. students in progress \u00b7 toward the doctoral degree. A graduate emphasis in Feminist \u00b7 Studies also is available. Refer to the Women's Studies section of the Catalogue for information. The graduate program emphasizes rigorous training in language and textual analysis, with equal attention given to the historical, \u00b7 social, and cultural dimensions of literary study. In addition to more traditional vocabularies of criticism and theory, the curricu\u00ad lum encourages exploration of recent challenges to established conceptual and methodological frameworks. The program builds on the foundation of a faculty whose research interests engage major issues in Chinese, Japanese, and Korean literature and cul\u00ad ture, while developing connections with the larger community of scholarship at UCI. An emphasis in Critical Theory is available to graduate students in all departments of the School of Humanities. Because the graduate program is designed to prepare students for both college-level teaching and advanced research, each student will be required to serve, under direct faculty supervision, as a teaching assistant in an appropriate undergraduate course offered through the Department. As noted below, one quarter's worth of this teaching may be counted as part of the required course work toward completion of the degree. Assuming that a student is enrolled full-time and enters the pro\u00ad gram with no major deficiencies in background or training, normal time needed to complete the Ph.D. degree is six years from matric\u00ad ulation. For students admitted with an M.A. degree or its equiva\u00ad lent from another institution, certain course requirements may be . waived upon the approval of a faculty advisory committee, with a consequent reduction in normative time for completion of the Ph.D. MASTER OF ARTS IN EAST ASIAN LANGUAGES \u00b7 AND LITERATURES Students are not admitted to an M.A.-only degree program but may be granted an M.A. in recognition of progress toward the Ph.D., normally after six quarters of course work and submission of two approved seminar papers, which will serve as the M.A. examination. UC IRVINE - 1996-1997DOCTOR OF PHILOSOPHY IN EAST ASIAN LANGUAGES AND LITERATURES Requirements for Admission In addition to meeting the general requirements for admission to graduate study at UCI, specified by the Office of Graduate Studies, all students must present the following for review by an admis\u00ad sions committee composed of members of the faculty in East Asian Languages and Literatures: records of prior scholastic perfor\u00ad mance, including all college transcripts; three letters of recommen\u00ad dation; samples of written work; and aptitude scores from the Graduate Record Examination. Although the Department does not require entering students to have received an undergraduate degree comparable to its own, it recommends as much preparation in an East Asian language as possible. It also welcomes applications from students whose language training may not be as extensive but who have shown promise in the study of related disciplines. The study of appropriate European languages is encouraged as well. General Requirements Upon admission to the program, the student is assigned a graduate advisor, in consultation with whom an advisory committee consist\u00ad ing of two additional faculty members is constituted. The student. and committee plan a program of study consisting of 15 graduate courses. Before advancement to candidacy (normally after three years of graduate study), the student must have: (1) completed required course work as detailed below; (2) prepared one paper of publish\u00ad able quality; (3) completed language requirements as listed below; (4) prepared five research reports on current scholarly articles to be decided upon in consultation with the fitculty advisor; and (5) passed the qualifying examinations on four topics to be selected in consultation with the faculty advisory committee no more than two quarters before the examinations are to be taken. At least one of the topics should be related directly to the student's projected area of specialization in dissertation research. Students who complete the qualifying examinations successfully are advanced to candidacy for the Ph.D. degree. They then write their doctoral dissertation on a topic developed in consultation with the faculty advisory committee. Some period of study abroad, for enhancement of language proficiency and/or dissertation research, is strongly encouraged. Concentration in Chinese Course Work. Each student is required to complete: three courses from Chinese 201-204; Chinese 211A-B or 212A-B; Chinese 213A\u00ad B; Chinese 214; and seven additional courses (of which one may be in the graduate teaching program) as determined upon consulta\u00ad tion with faculty advisors. At least three of these additional courses must be taken outside the Department on a relevant topic in liter\u00ad ary or cultural theory. Courses taken to fulfill language require\u00ad ments may not be counted toward the course work requirement. Language Requirements. Before advancement to candidacy, all students must have completed four years of modern Chinese, two years of classical Chinese, and three years of modern Japanese, and have demonstrated reading proficiency in another appropriate language. Much of this work may, of course, have been completed prior to admission. In addition, the requirement for a second year of classical Chinese may be fulfilled by taking three reading courses in classical literature. Concentration in Japanese Course Work. Each student is required to complete: three courses from Japanese 201-204; Japanese 211A-B or 212A-B; Japanese 213A-B; Japanese 214; and seven additional courses (of which one may be in the graduate teaching program) as determined upon consultation with faculty advisors. At least three of these additional East Asian Languages and Literatures 199 courses must be taken outside the Department on relevant topics in literary or cultural theory. Courses taken to fulfill language require\u00ad ments may not be counted toward the course work requirement. Language Requirements. Before advancement to candidacy, all students must have completed four years of modern Japanese and one year of classical Japanese, and have demonstrated reading pro\u00ad ficiency in another appropriate language. In addition, students emphasizing classical Japanese are required to take one year of classical Chinese. Much of this work may, of course, have been completed prior to admission. Concentration in East Asian Cultural Studies Course Work. Each student is required to complete: four Theory and Cultural Studies graduate courses; four graduate courses in Chinese, Japanese, or Korean; and seven additional courses (of which one may be in the graduate teaching program) as determined upon consultation with faculty advisors. At least three of these additional courses must be taken outside the Department on rele\u00ad vant topics. Courses taken to fulfill language requirements may not be counted toward the course work requirement. Other Requirements. Before advancement to candidacy, all stu\u00ad dents must have completed examinations in four areas as deter\u00ad mined upon consultation with faculty advisors. These areas will vary according to the interests of the student; examples might be Colonial and Postcolonial Theories; Modernity and East Asia; Cri\u00ad tique of Asian Studies as a Field; Gender, Class and East Asia; Visual Culture and Japan; and Theorizing Minority Status in East Asia. All students must have completed four years of Chinese, Japanese, or Korean, or the equivalent. Three years or the equiva\u00ad lent in a second East Asian Language is recommended. Much of this work may, of course, have been completed prior to admission. Courses in Chinese UNDERGRADUATE lA-B-C Fundamental Mandarin Chinese (5-5-5) F, W, S.

Wlecke, Ph.D. Michigan State University, Professor Emeritus of English (English and American Romanticism, teaching of composition) Geoffrey Wolff, Novelist and Biographer, Director of Fiction, Programs in Writing, and Professor of English and Creative Writing (creative writing, fiction, biography) The Department of English and Comparative Literature is con\u00ad cerned with the nature and value of literature, possible approaches to literary works, and the relation of literary criticism to the intel\u00ad lectual issues of the day. Fundamentally it is concerned with the humanistic problem of value. Thus its main literary concern is crit\u00ad ical and theoretical. Though not alone in the task, the Department recognizes a continuing obligation to help all students write the English language with clarity and grace. Students are given the opportunity to participate in departmental affairs through two elected student committees, one of undergradu\u00ad ates, one of graduates. The committees meet periodically with fac\u00ad ulty committees of the Department, and the recommendations of student committees become matters of record which accompany any recommendations emanating from the Department. Each quar\u00ad ter all students taking classes within the Department have the opportunity to evaluate their courses and teachers. CAREERS FOR THE ENGLISH OR COMPARATIVE LITERATURE MAJOR The study of literature helps students to express their ideas clearly, do independent research, and think analytically and imaginatively. These capabilities will help qualify majors for careers in education, law, technical writing, communications, journalism, public rela\u00ad tions, business, and management. An undergraduate major in either English or Comparative Literature is also an especially good preparation for graduate study. Departmental advisors encourage their students to investigate vari\u00ad ous careers-especially those outside the traditional fields for such majors (e.g., graduate study and law)-before these students have completed their undergraduate educations. UC IRVINE - 1996-1997The Career and Life Planning Center provides services to UCI stu\u00ad dents and alumni including career counseling, information about job opportunities, a career library, and workshops on resume preparation, job search, and interview techniques. See the Career and Life Planning Center section for additional information. Undergraduate Program The Department offers to the undergraduate three areas of study: The Program in Literary Criticism, which emphasizes a variety of critical approaches in the reading and criticism of English, American, and comparative literature. \u00b7 The Programs in Writing, which offer an emphasis in the writing of poetry or fiction. Undergraduate courses in journalism and non\u00ad fiction are also available, including formal instruction and work\u00ad shop experience for staff members of the campus newspaper. The aim of these programs is to encourage the creative powers of stu\u00ad dents while introducing them to the discipline of reading and prac\u00ad tical criticism, often in workshop situations. Under certain circum\u00ad stances, creative writing courses may satisfy part of the writing requirement portion of the UCI breadth requirement (Category 1). The Program in Comparative Literature, which, though admin\u00ad istratively a part of the Department, is basically interdisciplinary in its orientation, drawing on faculty and other resources from the fields of the various modem and classical literatures and drama. The consciousness of the modern educated person is the product of centuries of cultural heritage, including not only works of literature in one's own language but world literature from Homer to Gide and Thomas Mann. At UCI, Comparative Literature is regarded as the study of literature from the international point of view rather than in a national framework. A student who completes a degree in Comparative Literature will be expected to have a grasp of the his\u00ad tory of literature in its broad outlines and to be able to deal compe\u00ad tently with literary texts, whatever their period or national origins. Comparative Literature is well-suited for students interested in a double major. Since the Department believes that a student of literature should recognize the importance of understanding theoretical problems in literature, of developing a broad acquaintance with literary texts, and of experiencing the problems of literary creation at first hand, the Department invites students to take work in all three of its pro\u00ad grams, with an emphasis in one of the first two (toward a Bache\u00ad lor's degree in English) or a major in the third (toward a Bache\u00ad lor's degree in Comparative Literature). Many of the courses will vary in specific content from year to year, depending on the plans of individual teachers, since the Department recognizes that no course can treat all the major authors and works relevant to a given period or topic. REQUIREMENTS FOR THE BACHELOR'S DEGREE University Requirements: See pages 57-61. School Requirements: See page 190. Departmental Requirements for the English Major Three courses selected from E 28A (orE 28D), E or CL 50A (in some cases, students who change their majors to English after taking E 6, E 7, E 8 may petition to substitute one of those courses for a course from theE 28 series); CR lOOA; CR lOOB and CL 100 (in some cases, students may petition to substitute courses numbered 102-106 for these courses); E 102A, E 102B, E 102C, E 102D; at least three more Departmental courses num\u00ad bered 102 or above (excluding E 140, E 150, WR 139, or WR 179); and either E 105 or CL 105. English and Comparative Literature 203 Competence in a foreign language, either classical or modern, equivalent to six quarters of work at UCI (in classical languages, lA-B-C, 25, 101, 102) plus (in modern languages) one course in a foreign literature in whichtexts are read in the original language. (Some languages, such as Chinese, Japanese, or Russian, may ordi\u00ad narily require three years of language study as preparation for the study of literature; a student who lacks three years of language study may occasionailyarrange with the instructor of a literature-in\u00ad translation course to read selected texts in the original language.) Students selecting a writing emphasis have some flexibility in sub\u00ad stituting writing workshops for period and genre courses; their -total courses riorlnally _number more than the usual major. Residence Requirement for the English Major: CR 1 OOA, CR 100B, and three E 102s must be completed successfully at UCI. Departmental Requirements for the English Minor Three courses selected from E 28A (orE 28D), E 6, E 7, E 8, CL 8, including at least one quarter of E 28; and at least five English or writing courses numbered 102 or higher (excluding WR 139), although two courses from the following may be substituted: CR 100A, CR 100B, WR 100B, CL 100, for the English Minor: Four upper-divi\u00ad sion courses must be successfully completed at UCI. Departmental Requirements for the Comparative Literature Major Sufficient competence in a foreign language, either modern or clas\u00ad sical, to be able to read any standard literary or critical text in that language. If the student intends to continue with graduate work, the study of a second foreign language is highly recommended before graduation. Three quarters of lower-division work: Comparative Literature majors are normally required to take CL 50A, B, C. Transfer stu\u00ad dents may be required to take one or more courses in the sequence depending on the courses they have taken previously. \u00b7 . Normally 10 upper-division courses in addition: usually these will \u00b7 include CR 100A, CL 100 twice, two courses (one 101 and one above 101) in a selected foreign language, or two lOis in two dif- . ferent foreign languages, or two years of a classical language; two courses from CL 103 or CL 104; three additional upper-division :courses chosen from the offerings in comparative literature, Eng\u00ad lish, literary criticism, and creative writing. Courses in allied areas, e.g., history, philosophy, social science, may be counted toward the major if they deal with literary or philosophical texts, though prior approval of a faculty advisor is necessary. Residence Requirement for the Comparative Literature Major: CR lOOA and four upper-division English or Comparative Literature courses must be completed successfully at UCI. Departmental Requirements for the Comparative Literature Minor CL 50A, B, C, CR lOOA, CL 100, CL 103 or 104 (three courses), and one upper-division literature course taught in a foreign language. Residence Requirements for the Comparative Literature Minor: Four upper-division courses must be successfully com\u00ad pleted at UCI. PLANNING A PROGRAM OF STUDY . Students should plan coherent programs of study with their faculty advisors, including undergraduate seminars, workshops in writing (for students choosing a writing emphasis), and courses in allied areas outside the Department. It is possible to combine a cluster of courses in literature with other majors in the sciences and social UC IRVINE - 1996-1997I 204 UCI 1996-97 School of Humanities sciences, and to use an English or Comparative Literature major as preprofessional training in government, law, or medicine. Students who wish advice in planning such programs should consult both the Department and people in their prospective professional areas. Students who intend to pursue a single-subject or multiple-subject teaching credential must consult the UCI Department of Education to ensure that they understand the departmental and State requirements. A student who intends to continue with graduate work is urged to study a second foreign language before graduation. Students are also encouraged to take advantage of the opportunity to study abroad through the Education Abroad Program. See the Center for International Education section of the Catalogue or your academic counselor for additional information. Graduate Program The Department's three principal areas of work on the undergradu\u00ad ate level-English and American Literature, Comparative Litera-\u00b7 ture, and the English major with writing emphasis-are reflected in the graduate programs: the M.A. and Ph.D. in English, the M.A. and Ph.D. in Comparative Literature, and the M.F.A. in English (Creative Writing). A student's courses for the M.A. and Ph.D. in English may include or emphasize work in American literature as well. The faculty is particularly equipped to guide students with special interests in criticism and theory, an area which candidates for the Ph.D. in English or in Comparative Literature may stress in their qualifying examinations and dissertations. Ordinarily students are not admitted to the English or Comparative Literature pro\u00ad grams unless they plan to continue, and are qualified to continue, to the degree of Ph.D. Students are admitted to the M.F.A. program chiefly on the basis of submitted creative work. A committee of the Department, with the consent of the Dean of Graduate Studies, admits students to these programs. Each program has a director appointed by the Department Chair, but there are close administra\u00ad tive and intellectual ties among the programs. Specific requirements for the graduate degrees will be established by consultation between members of the faculty and the candidate. The first-year graduate student or the candidate for the Master of Fine Arts in English (Creative Writing) plans a program with an assigned advisor; candidates for the Ph.D. plan with an advisor and three-person committee. At the time of the M.A. examination, the Graduate Committee evaluates the student's graduate career up to that point and offers advice about future prospects. Candidates for literary degrees are encouraged to study philosophy, history, for\u00ad eign languages and literatures, and the fine arts. Applicants for graduate degrees in English must submit scores for the Graduate Record Examination (GRE) including the Subject Test in Literature in English; applicants to the Comparative Litera\u00ad ture program need not submit the Subject Test in Literature in English. Only in exceptional circumstances will students be permitted to undertake programs of less than six full courses during the acade\u00ad mic year. The normal expectation is enrollment in three courses each quarter; Teaching Assistants take two courses in addition to earning credit for University teaching. Students who are not teach\u00ad ing should be able to complete course work in two years. The Ph.D. qualifying examination should be taken within a couple of quarters after courses are finished. Dissertations can be written in a year. The Ph.D. in English or the Ph.D. in Comparative Literature normally should be completed in six years or less. The Department recognizes that many of its graduate students intend to become teachers, and it believes that graduate departments should be training college teachers as well as scholars-indeed, that teach\u00ad ing and most literary scholarship complement one another. Thus the Department has initiated a program by which all its Ph.D. can-didates, in English as well as in Comparative Literature, may gain supervised training as part of the formal seminar work required for the degree. M.F.A. candidates also have the opportunity to partici\u00ad pate in this program. Candidates for the Ph.D. are expected to acquire experience in teaching. All those interested in graduate study in the Department should obtain the brochure on graduate programs from the departmental office. The Murray Krieger Endowed Fellowship in Literary Theory will be awarded for the first time in the 1996-97 academic year. It is intended for an outstanding entering graduate student who is pur\u00ad suing the Ph.D. in English or Comparative Literature and who demonstrates a primary interest in theory as theory relates to liter\u00ad ary texts. This prestigious grant is the foremost fellowship in the Humanities and one of the largest at UCI. The five-year support package is worth over $92,000. Also included is a readership and study space in the Rene Wellek Collection at the UCI Library, in addition to benefits such as priority housing and access to child care. A range of other fellowships is also available to students in the Department. Emphasis in Feminist Studies A graduate emphasis in Feminist Studies also is available. Refer to the Women's Studies section of the Catalogue for information. ENGLISH Master of Arts in English Each candidate for the M.A. will be assigned to a graduate advisor who will supervise the student's program. The M.A. plan of study includes (1) the completion of course work, as advised, for three quarters or the equivalent; (2) demonstrated proficiency in reading a designated foreign language, modern or classical; and (3) the submission of materials (including a statement about work accom\u00ad plished imd plans for future study, and a sample essay) to the Grad\u00ad uate Committee, who will review and assess the student's progress, recommend whether further study toward the Ph.D. is advisable, and, if so, give advice about areas for further study. The Department of English and Comparative Literature sponsors a Summer M.A. Program in English designed for teachers. The M.A. degree in English is awarded to candidates who complete 32 units of graduate course work through two consecutive summers in the program and submit an acceptable Master's essay. Applicants from outside the State of California may apply for the program. Master of Fine Arts in English The Master of Fine Arts (M.F.A.) is a degree in creative writing. The M.F.A. degree is normally conferred upon the completion of a two-to three-year residence. Each quarter the candidate will be enrolled in either the poetry or fiction section of the Graduate Writers' Workshop, which will constitute two-thirds of a course load, the other course to be selected in consultation with the stu\u00ad dent's advisor. It is expected that M.F.A. candidates will complete at least one supervised teaching seminar. In addition to course work, the candidate is required to pass an examination on a reading list of literary works in the genre selected, and to present as a thesis an acceptable book-length man\u00ad uscript of poetry or short stories or a novel. Doctor of Philosophy in English The program for the Ph.D. in English requires about two years of full-time enrollment in regular courses beyond the B.A. (two courses of which may be in the graduate teaching program); profi\u00ad ciency in the reading of two acceptable foreign languages, modern or classical; the dissertation; and satisfactory performance on designated examinations. UC IRVINE - 1996-1997The languages acceptable depend upon the nature of the student's program as determined by the student's advisors. Reading compe\u00ad tence in one of these languages must be established in the first year of residence, and competence in the second well before the general examination. Students admitted at the post-M.A. level must provide evidence of satisfactory competence in foreign languages. Competence in one of the two languages required for the Ph.D. is verified through a course in theory and practice of translation; the other language may be verified through examination. Upon completion of course work the student is examined in four areas: (1) literary theory and criticism; (2) literary form; (3) histor\u00ad ical period of English and/or American literature; and (4) selected major authors. The student has the opportunity to present personal choices for the examination, but the choices must enable an indi\u00ad vidual to demonstrate breadth of historical knowledge and literary understanding and therefore must be approved by the advisory committee. Upon satisfactorily completing the general examination and the oral Qualifying Examination, the student is admitted to candidacy for the degree. As soon after completion of the general examina\u00ad tion as is practical, the student presents an essay leading to disser\u00ad tation for the approval of the doctoral committee. The dissertation itself must also be approved by the committee, which may or may not require an oral examination on it. All work for the Ph.D. degree must be in courses limited to graduate students. COMPARATIVE LITERATURE Applicants to the Comparative Literature program must hold a B.A. or equivalent degree and should normally have majored in Comparative Literature, English, or a foreign literature. Majors in other disciplines (e.g., philosophy, history) can be considered, pro\u00ad vided that a sufficient background in literature and literary theory, as well as in at least one foreign language, is demonstrated. For the graduate student in Comparative Literature a professional competence in foreign languages is essential. French and German are usually expected of all doctoral students, but other languages (for instance, Spanish, Italian, Russian, or an Asian language) may be substituted. A classical language may prove indispensable for work in many traditional fields of literary study, and the scholar's own specialization may require the mastery of still other languages. An important part of the foreign language requirement is the course CL 220 (Problems in Translation) in which the student plans and carries out a high-quality translation of a literary or theoretical text. The translation, along with an introduction or other scholarly apparatus explaining and defending the technical decisions in\u00ad volved in the task, is then submitted as a paper for course credit. Master of Arts in Comparative Literature Entering students are assigned a faculty advisor who usually serves as the chair of the student's M.A. examination committee (which consists of at least two other members of the faculty). The M.A. examination is normally taken during the quarter in which the stu\u00ad dent completes the course work; nine courses, including at least one CL 220, are required. The candidate submits an M.A. paper as well as a statement of purpose outlining past and future course work and preliminary plans for the qualifying examination. The M.A. examination itself consists of a discussion of the student's paper and the statement of purpose. In practice, the examination resembles an extended advising session, but with particularly close attention given to the student's paper. Doctor of Philosophy in Comparative Literature The doctoral program in Comparative Literature is designed to pre\u00ad pare the student for a professional career in literary studies. Details of the program may be found in the departmental graduate student English and Comparative Literature 205 handbook. Normally, students who have not done graduate work at another university complete at least 16 courses before the qualify\u00ad ing examination, including two translation seminars (CL 220). Upon completion of the course work, the student takes a general examination based on six topics formulated by the student in con\u00ad sultation with the four faculty members who will make up the exam\u00ad ination committee. The topics should combine historical breadth and some generic variety with special fields. The examination is part written, part oral, according to a formula decided by the stu\u00ad dent and the committee. The examination as a whole should reflect the student's ability to work in at least two foreign languages. After passing the qualifying examination, the student forms a dis\u00ad sertation committee of three faculty members, formulates a disser\u00ad tation topic in consultation with them, and submits a prospectus for the dissertation along with a preliminary bibliography. The study toward the Doctor of Philosophy degree culminates in the writing of a suitable dissertation, often on a comparative subject, although subjects lying within a single literature or dealing with general lit\u00ad erary and theoretical problems not confined to any specific litera\u00ad tures are also acceptable.

Yet so much of our exposure to these forces remains taken for granted, indeed unreflected. The sights and sounds of movies and television compel and excite us, perhaps more so than many of us realize or would like to admit. An under\u00ad graduate education in Film Studies encourages students to explore the appeal and operation of these complex meaning-producing \u00b7 machines we call cinema and television. The course work leading to the B.A. degree in Film Studies trains students to become visually and aurally literate, to grasp films and images in their socioeconomic, political, and aesthetic dimensions. This entails looking at mainstream films with a more critical gaze as well as gaining a regard for different kinds of movies and alter\u00ad native ways of seeing. The Film Studies curriculum is systematic and comprehensive; courses are typically taught by regular faculty in classes of about 20 to 50 students. During the 1995-96 academic year, there were more than 85 Film Studies majors enrolled at UCI. The Program familiarizes students with the history, theory, and art of cinema, individual filmmakers, period styles, genres, and aspects of television. Additional courses address the practical and technical concerns of film production and scriptwriting. Regular course offerings are complemented by student-run film series; spe\u00ad cial screenings and retrospectives; visits from directors, critics, and scholars; and trips to film festivals, as well as critical symposia. Film Studies at UCI is unique in its concentration on the history, theory, and criticism of cinema and television. The faculty has pub\u00ad lished books and articles on such topics as French surrealist cin\u00ad ema, films of the Third Reich, images of the Vietnam war, Holly\u00ad wood melodramas, contemporary avant-garde directors, film and postmodernism, and women filmmakers. The Program provides its majors with a thorough appreciation of the modern media's innu\u00ad merable functions in contemporary society. The School of Humanities charges a laboratory fee of $20 per course to all students taking Film Studies courses. Film Studies students have the opportunity to spend their junior year in France studying at the Inter-University Center for Film and Critical Studies in Paris, through the University's Education Abroad Program. Information is available both in the Film Studies Office and the Education Abroad Program Office. CAREER OPPORTUNITIES A degree in Film Studies will provide students with a variety of opportunities to explore a wide range of interests leading to a career choice or to further education at the graduate or professional level. Graduates from the program have gone on to a host of differ\u00ad ent careers. Some have pursued graduate work in critical film stud\u00ad ies at leading institutions such as the University of California, Los Angeles, and the University of Iowa. Others have entered M.F.A. programs in production at places like the University of Southern California or San Francisco State University. Many are now at work in various sectors of the entertainment industry as feature film editors, executives in video distribution companies, techni\u00ad cians for local news programs, and independent filmmakers. The Career and Life Planning Center provides services to UCI stu\u00ad dents and alumni including career counseling, information about job opportunities, a career library, and workshops on resume preparation, job search, and interview techniques.

Rabine, Ph.D. Stanford University, Professor of French (nineteenth\u00ad century French literature and women's studies) Richard L. Regosin, Ph.D. The Johns Hopkins University, Department Chair and Professor of French (sixteenth-century French literature) The Department of French and Italian offers courses designed to provide linguistic competence and a broad knowledge of aspects of French and Italian culture: literary, social, historical, and aesthetic. It seeks to enrich students' appreciation of their own civilizations and to create a deeper sense of international understanding. The program brings the students to participate in the creative process of language, to think in French or Italian as they learn to understand, speak, read, and write. Most classes are taught entirely in the foreign language, and a multiple approach stresses the inter\u00ad dependence of the four basic skills and makes them mutually rein\u00ad forcing. The Language Laboratory is used to complement class\u00ad room activity. All upper-division literature and culture courses are taught in the seminar mode. Because classes are limited in number of students, they promote and encourage participation and discussion and facil\u00ad itate direct contact with professors. Representatives chosen by the undergraduate French majors and by the graduate students serve on departmental committees. These representatives also participate in Department meetings and are responsible for student evaluation procedures. UC IRVINE - 1996-1997I 210 UCI 1996-97 School of Humanities CAREERS FOR THE FRENCH MAJOR The great majority of students who major in French pursue careers in various sectors of the world of business and commerce, where they can take advantage not only of their competency in communi\u00ad cating in French but also of what they have learned from the study of French literature and civilization. The study of literature teaches students to think critically and develops analytical skills; it also helps them to express their own ideas clearly and persuasively. In practical terms, these skills will allow them to operate efficiently in marketing, publicity, public relations, and management, where sophistication has become essential. A number of students also fol\u00ad low careers in education, continue their studies in graduate school, or enter the diplomatic service. The Career and Life Planning Center provides services to UCI stu\u00ad dents and alumni including career counseling, information about job opportunities, a career library, and workshops on resume preparation, job search, and interview techniques. See the Career and Life Planning Center section for additional information. Undergraduate Program in French While preparing the student for graduate work and for the teaching profession, the French major is essentially a liberal arts program offering a broad, humanistic course of study. At the intermediate lower-division level, texts of contemporary lit\u00ad erary and social interest provide the focus for advanced conversa\u00ad tion, reading, and composition. After the second year, courses in speaking (conversation and pho\u00ad netics) and writing enable the students to attain a greater degree of proficiency, preparing them for further study in French literature and linguistics and in French civilization and culture. In the introductory courses in literature, complete texts are studied in their historical context. The student learns to analyze and inter\u00ad pret different types of creative literature and is introduced ~o vari\u00ad ous critical concepts and vocabulary. At the more advanced level, literature courses may emphasize a single author, movement, or critical problem within a historical period. Many courses are multi\u00ad disciplinary, bringing together reading material and methodologies from the various disciplines in order to address interpretive prob\u00ad lems of French literature, culture, and history. In recent years, courses have been offered in literature and existentialism; repre\u00ad sentations of the Franco-Prussian war; drama and politics in the court of Louis XiV; literature and French fascism; memory, orality, and tradition in French-African literature; images of death in the literature and culture of the French Renaissance. The content of these courses changes yearly according to the interests of both fac\u00ad ulty and students. Senior seminars are offered periodically to dis\u00ad cuss literary problems which cannot be dealt with in depth in the regular offerings. Students are placed in French courses according to their years of previous study. In general, one year of high school French is equated with one quarter of UCI work. Thus, students with one, two, three, and four years of high school French will enroll in French lB, lC, 2A, and 2B, respectively. Exceptions to this place\u00ad ment formula must be approved by the appropriate course director. Students with transfer credit for college-level French may not repeat those courses for credit. REQUIREMENTS FOR THE BACHELOR'S DEGREE University Requirements: See pages 57-61. School Requirements: See page 190. Departmental Requirements for the Major French lOOA-B, 101A-B-C, and nine other upper-division courses taught in the Department. Students may take up to two courses from the Department offerings taught in English. Residence Requirement for the Major: At least five upper-divi\u00ad sion courses (above 101A-B-C) required for the major must be completed successfully at UCI. Departmental Requirements for the Minor French lOOA-B plus five other French courses, four of which must be upper-division. Prerequisite: French 2C or equivalent. Residence Requirement for the Minor: Four upper-division courses must be successfully completed at UCI. PLANNING A PROGRAM OF STUDY The student and the faculty advisor (assigned upon entering the major) should plan a coherent program of courses to fulfill the major requirements. The Department encourages the student to study in France, either through the University's Education Abroad Program or indepen\u00ad dently. Information is available in the Department Office. Students should consult with faculty members concerning career plans in areas such as teaching, industry, journalism, law, and civil service. Undergraduate Program in Italian The Department offers a minor in Itaiian. Lower-division courses gradually develop the student's mastery of spoken and written Ital\u00ad ian and, as the sequence progresses, introduce readings in literature and culture. A third-year, two-quarter sequence is designed to improve the stu\u00ad dent's proficiency in aural and written comprehension as well as in speaking and writing skills. A three-quarter introduction to Italian literature acquaints the student with major historical periods and genres, and introduces the student to various critical concepts and vocabulary. Tutorial and seminar courses provide the advanced stu\u00ad dent with an opportunity for in-depth study of a single author, criti\u00ad cill problem, or historical period. From year to year, the Depart\u00ad ment's offerings in literature vary considerably; students interested in planning course work in Italian should consult with Department of French and Italian faculty. Students are encouraged to pursue their interests through a major in Humanities, leading to a B.A. degree in Humanities, which com\u00ad bines Italian literature, culture, history, art, and music. Departmental Requirements for the Minor ltallan lOOA-B, lOlA-B-C, 130, and one other course outside the Department on Italian history, film, art, or other aspect of Italian culture, chosen in consultation with Department of French and Italian faculty. Residence Requirement for the Minor: Four upper-division courses must be successfully completed at UCI. Graduate Program in French The Department's program of graduate study reflects its concern with the nature of both literature and the critical discourses used to interpret it. Seminars focusing on relationships between literature and theory explore various critical approaches and engage related UC IRVINE - 1996-1997fields of inquiry such as history, philosophy, aesthetics, psycho\u00ad analysis, women's studies, and anthropology. MASTER OF ARTS IN FRENCH The Master of Arts degree is considered to be a step toward the Ph.D. degree; only students intending to'pursue .studies for the doc\u00ad torate are admitted to the program. Performance on the Master's examination, usually given in the second year of graduate study, determines entrance into the doctoral program. Most candidates take a minimum of 11 graduate courses. Particularly\u00b7 well-prepared students may receive special permission to take a minimum of nine courses and to write a short thesis, for which two course credits are given. All entering graduate students are counseled by the graduate advisor. During the spring quarter of each year, the teaching per\u00ad formance and academic record of each student who is a Teaching Assistant are evaluated. All graduate students are also given a writ\u00ad ten evaluation of their work on a course-by-course basis. Profi\u00ad ciency in a foreign language in addition to French is required for the M.A. degree (proficiency is defined as the equivalent of the level attained at the end of course 2C). All M.A. candidates are required to pass a written and oral com\u00ad prehensive examination on material drawn from the class program and the Master's reading list. The student writes essays demon\u00ad strating skills of literary analysis and an understanding of theoreti\u00ad cal concepts and their application to the study of specific literary texts. The oral part of the examination allows elaboration on aspects of the written examination, but seeks as well to test the stu\u00ad dents' broader knowledge. The Master's examination is normally given at the end of winter quarter. Students who are Teaching Assistants normally take the examination in the fifth quarter of their studies. DOCTOR OF PHILOSOPHY IN FRENCH Upon successful completion of the Master's examination and admission to the Ph.D. program, or upon admission with a Mas\u00ad ter's degree from an accredited institution, a Guidance Committee is appointed in consultation with the student. The Guidance Com\u00ad mittee advises the student in the choice of courses to help prepare for the written and oral Qualifying Examinations leading to advance\u00ad ment to candidacy for the Ph.D. degree. The Committee is com\u00ad prised of five faculty members: three from the Department, one from outside the Department who represents the student's outside area of specialization, and, for the qualifying examination, another faculty member not affiliated with the Department who represents the faculty-at-large. One member of the Committee is expected to direct the dissertation. Language Requirements: A reading knowledge of two foreign languages relevant to the student's area of specialization and sub\u00ad ject to the approval of the Guidance Committee. Course Requirements: A minimum of 18 graduate courses or seminars in French beyond the B.A. and three graduate courses outside the Department in areas related to the field of specializa\u00ad tion are required. A student may pursue the Ph.D. with particular emphasis in literary theory by taking additional course work in the Department and in the Critical Theory Program beyond the minimum number required. A graduate emphasis in Feminist Studies also is available. Refer to the Women's Studies section of the Catalogue for information. Teaching: Since the overwhelming majority of Ph.D. candidates plan to teach, the Department recognizes its responsibility to train them as teachers. Therefore, as far as it is possible, all candidates without previous teaching experience are required to participate in a program of supervised teaching for at least one year. French and Italian 211 Qualifying Examination-Written and Oral: Upon completion of course work, the student takes a series of examinations involving problems of a critical and interpretive nature. The Ph.D. Examina\u00ad tion encourages focus and depth at a time when the student's area of specialization and eventual dissertation topic should be taking an increasingly clearer shape. Accordingly, the examination is divided into five topic areas: author, genre, period, critical problem, and an outside area. In consultation with the Guidance Committee, the stu\u00ad dent defines the precise nature and scope of the topics for the exam\u00ad ination, which consists of written and oral parts. Upon successful completion of the written and oral Qualifying Examinations, the student is advanced to candidacy for the Ph.D. degree. Dissertation: The dissertation topic chosen by the candidate will normally, but not necessarily, fall within one of the major fields covered by the Qualifying Examination. The dissertation must be defended in an oral examination and approved by the Doctoral Committee before the candidate is recommended for the degree. Three faculty members, chosen by the candidate, proposed by the Department, and appointed on behalf of the Dean of Graduate Studies and the Graduate Council, constitute the Doctoral Commit\u00ad tee which directs the preparation and completion of the doctoral dissertation. The Doctoral Committee supervises an oral defense, the focus of which is the content of the doctoral dissertation, and certifies that a completed dissertation is satisfactory.

Saine, Ph.D. Yale University, Professor of German (eighteenth\u00ad century German literature, Goethe) \\John H. Smith, Ph.D. Princeton University, Associate Professor of German (eighteenth- and nineteenth-century literature and intellectual history, literary theory) The Department of German pursues a program of German studies as part of the humanistic endeavor to understand and evaluate cul\u00ad ture. Departmental courses are focused on language, literature, and film in context, that is, within the historical, social, intellectual, and political circumstances of their production and continuing recep\u00ad tion. Clearly, we come to understand ourselves and our immediate culture much better through the study of different languages and cultural systems. Therefore, university language study is not merely a matter of memorizing vocabulary and practicing pronunciation. It is the serious investigation of a foreign linguistic system and the cultures which are defined by it. It is difficult-in fact, nearly impossible-for us to scrutinize and analyze something we know as intimately as our native language, and yet this is the order by which we formulate our thoughts and the order which may some\u00ad times formulate our thoughts for us. The \"foreignness\" of a foreign language allows us to objectify an entire linguistic system, to observe its structure and its usage, and then to make comparisons with our own linguistic situation. This kind of knowledge of one's native language is the foundation of critical reflection on texts of German 213 any nature-historical, philosophical, literary, political, legal, jour\u00ad nalistic, and others. Thus, serious study of a foreign language is absolutely crucial to a university education. The Department teaches its language courses with this principle in mind and seeks to provide its students with a framework for these linguistic and cultural comparisons. Department literature and film courses offer a variety of critical perspectives from historical, social, or politically engaged readings to feminist and post-structuralist analysis. Topics range from stud\u00ad ies of individual authors, periods, and genres to the history of Ger\u00ad man-language literature and film, the theory of criticism, and the relations of German-language literature to other literatures. Undergraduate Program The German major offers alternative emphases, one in literature and another in linguistics. The majority of students choose the lit\u00ad erature major. All courses in the Department are taught in German to the extent compatible with the aim of the course. In the basic courses, stu\u00ad dents develop an understanding of the language and its cultural context while learning the necessary skills for oral and limited written communication. Sessions in the language laboratory, the recently updated Language Learning Resource Center, assist stu\u00ad dents with their speaking and listening skills. By the end of the first year, students have learned the basic structure of the German language as they develop fundamental reading, writing, and speak\u00ad ing skills and listening comprehension. The intermediate and advanced levels reinforce these basic skills, while concentrating on increasing reading speed, writing fluency, and cultural competency. After completion of the intermediate level, students enroll in the Introduction to Literature course (German 101), which provides an introduction to genre, periodization, and the German terminology used in critical analysis. This course is taken in preparation for the upper-division literature and film courses (German 102, 117, 118, 119, 120), which range historically from the Reformation to the present and cover a variety of topics and approaches. A further series of courses (German 130, 140, 160) is taught in English for both German students and those who do not speak the language, and covers topics in literary theory and criticism as well as Ger\u00ad man-language cinema. Students are encouraged to participate in work-and study-abroad programs during the summer and their junior year. The Department recommends the University's Education Abroad Program (EAP) in Gottingen, Germany. Gottingen is an old university town in central Germany, where EAP students complete an advanced language program and enroll in university courses with great success, usu\u00ad ally achieving native or near-native fluency during this exciting year abroad. All EAP courses taken in Gottingen are accepted for UCI graduation credit and many contribute to fulfillment of the German major and minor requirements. More information is avail\u00ad able from your academic counselor. Students are placed in German courses according to their years of previous study. In general, one year of high school work is equated with one quarter of UCI work. Thus students with one, two, three, and four years of high school German will normally enroll in Ger\u00ad man 1B, 1C, 2A, and 2B respectively. Exceptions to this placement procedure must have the approval of the director of first-or sec\u00ad ond-year German instruction. Students with transfer credit for col\u00ad lege-level German may not repeat those courses. UC IRVINE - 1996-1997I 214 UCI 1996-97 School of Humanities CAREERSFORTHEGERMANMAJOR The ability to speak and write German can open up opportunities in communications, foreign trade and banking, transportation, gov\u00ad ernment, science and technology, tourism, library services, and teaching. Because German plays such an important role in modem technology, employers in international law, business, the foreign service, the airline industry, journalism, professional translating, and all levels of education increasingly seek students with a knowledge of German. German is excellent preparation for profes\u00ad sional schools. It can be combined successfully with work in the natural sciences, business and management, and the computer sci\u00ad ences, and it is invaluable for advanced work in the humanities and the arts. Recent graduates of the German Department have begun careers in international law, business, the foreign service, the airline industry, journalism, and all levels of education, including university teaching. The Career and Life Planning Center provides services to UCI stu\u00ad dents and alumni including career counseling, information about job opportunities, a career library, and workshops on resume preparation, job search, and interview techniques. See the Career and Life Planning Center section for additional information. REQUIREMENTS FOR THE BACHELOR'S DEGREE University Requirements: See pages 57--61. School Requirements: See page 190. Departmental Requirements for the German Major with Literature Emphasis German 100A-B-C; German 101; eight upper-division literature courses; and two courses selected from German 140, 150, 160, Linguistics 3, English and Comparative Literature CL 50A-B-C, a course in German history, German philosophy, or German political science, as approved by the advisor for the major. The upper-divi\u00ad sion writing requirement must be met by additional course work either within or outside the Department. Students who plan to acquire a teaching credential, or intend to do graduate work in literature, are encouraged to take the major with literature emphasis. Departmental Requirements for the German Major with Linguistic Emphasis German 100A-B-C; German 101; five upper-division literature courses; Linguistics 3, 110, 120; one course selected from Linguis\u00ad tics 170, a Middle High German course, or a course in the history of the German Language; one course selected from German 140, 150, 160. The upper-division writing requirement must be met by additional course work either within or outside the Department. The German major with linguistic emphasis is recommended espe\u00ad cially for students who intend to do graduate work in linguistics or enter a linguistics-related profession. Residence Requirements for the Major: At least five of the upper-division courses required for the major must be completed successfully at UCI. Departmental Requirements for the Minor Seven upper-division courses, which must include German 100A\u00ad B-C and German 101. Not more than one course from German 140, 150, or 160 may be counted for the minor. German 139 may not be used to satisfy minor requirements. Residence Requirement for the Minor: Four upper-division courses required for the minor must be completed successfully at UCI. Distinguished Visiting Professors The Department's Distinguished Visiting Professors program brings students into direct contact with some of the outstanding scholars in the field of German Studies. Distinguished Visiting Professors typically visit for one quarter, during which they teach a graduate course and an undergraduate course and present a lecture to which students, faculty, and other members of the University community are invited. Program participants include Bengt Algot Sprenson (Odense), Uwe Ketelsen (Bochum), Peter State), Hans Wysling (Zurich), Hans-Wolf Jager (Bremen), Norbert Oellers (Bonn), Hans Rudolf Vaget (Smith College), Heinrich Detering (Gottingen), Wolfgang Martens (Munich), and Anna Kuhn (UC Davis). Graduate Program In its graduate courses the Department stresses theoretical under\u00ad standing of the nature of literature and culture. Seminars focus on German literary and cultural development after 1700. An emphasis in Critical Theory is available to graduate students in all depart\u00ad ments of the School of Humanities. A graduate emphasis in Femi\u00ad nist Studies also is available. Refer to the Women's Studies section of the Catalogue for information. The graduate program in German is essentially a program leading to the Ph.D. The M.A. requires a minimum of one year in acade\u00ad mic residence and must be completed in no more than two years of full-time graduate study. The Department will decide after comple\u00ad tion of the M.A., at the latest, whether or not to permit the student to continue in the Ph.D. program. The M.A. thus may be in some cases a terminal degree. In those cases where the student enters the UCI graduate program in German with an M.A. from another insti\u00ad tution, the Department will evaluate the student's progress during the first year of study before deciding to allow continuation toward the Ph.D. Students who enter with normal academic preparation and pursue a full-time program of study ordinarily should be able to earn the Ph.D. degree within six years or less. MASTER OF ARTS IN GERMAN Before entering the program, a candidate is expected to have the equivalent of our undergraduate major. Students with a bachelor's degree in another subject may be considered for admission. Nor\u00ad mally their course of studies will have to be extended in order to make up for the deficiency. However, each case is considered indi\u00ad vidually by the faculty. The minimum course requirement for the M.A. degree is nine courses, eight of which must be taken within the Department of German. Reading knowledge of a foreign lan\u00ad guage other than German also is required for the M.A. degree. Whenever possible, a candidate is urged to complete this require\u00ad ment before entering the program. Further requirements follow. The Preparation of a Reading List. All candidates should prepare as early as possible a list of works read in the field of German lit\u00ad erature, both primary texts and critical works. This list should preferably be augmented by critical texts and by works from other literatures which, in the candidate's opinion, relate to the German works on the list. Since it should ultimately contain representative selections from various eras of German literature and some works of criticism, a tentative list must be discussed with the graduate advisor before the end of the fall quarter of the year in which the candidate expects to receive the M.A. Candidates should indicate on the Jist a number of works with which they are especially famil\u00ad iar. In its final form (including works read during the course of study both in and out of class) the list will be submitted together with the essay two weeks before the oral examination. It is the stu\u00ad dent's responsibility to keep the reading list current. UC IRVINE - 1996-1997The Master's Essay. The purpose of the written part of the M.A. comprehensive examination is to show the candidate's method\u00ad ological progress in interpreting German literature. It consists of an essay in which a text is elucidated and related to: (a) pertinent works by the same author, (b) its social and historical context, and (c) other works of German or other literatures with which the can\u00ad didate is familiar. The level of the discussion will normally be enhanced by the candidate's knowledge of the relevant secondary literature. The topic of the essay should be tentatively formulated and reported to the graduate advisor before the end of the second quarter of the student's residence. The Oral Examination. During the oral examination the follow\u00ad ing items will be discussed: (a) the essay, (b) the reading list. The discussion based on the reading list will\u00b7focus on works which the student knows well, but may broaden into other areas. One Year of Residence. DOCTOR OF PHILOSOPHY IN GERMAN The Department requires a minimum of 22 approved courses from students entering with a bachelor's degree. These may include courses in philosophy, history, comparative literature, and others suitable for the individual student's program of study. The student also will participate in each of the German Department's colloquia. The student will augment the reading list and keep it current dur\u00ad ing the whole course of study. At least two years of residence are required. Students entering with the master's degree will be advised individ\u00ad ually \"as to remaining course requirements. Since the majority of Ph.D. candidates choose careers as teachers, the German Department recognizes its obligation to offer them preparatory experience. Therefore, all candidates for the Ph.D. are required to teach under the supervision of a faculty member at least one course in each of three quarters (for which they will receive credit as German 399). Three of these courses may be counted toward the 22 courses required for the Ph.b. Comprehensive Examination. There are two parts to the exami\u00ad nation. In order to fulfill the written examination requirement the student will choose either (1) to present a lecture to the faculty and to the other graduate students, or (2) to write a three-part examina\u00ad tion (one part on a significant author, one on a major genre, and one on an historical period) within a period of two weeks. These examination essays may be either closed-book or take-home, by agreement with the candidate's examination committee. The exam\u00ad ination essays or the lecture will be on a text or texts selected by the faculty from a reading list submitted by the student for the comprehensive examination. The second part of the comprehensive examination is the formal oral qualifying examination of up to three hours duration ranging over the whole field of the student's studies, to be taken within two weeks after completion of the writ\u00ad ten examination. The student will submit the reading list at least two weeks before the written examination after consultation with the members of the examination committee. Language Requirements. The candidate must demonstrate read\u00ad ing knowledge of two languages or extensive competence in one language other than German or English. Choice of language(s) depends on the student's area of specialization. French and Latin are recommended. For the various ways in which these require\u00ad ments may be fulfilled, the student should see the graduate advisor. Dissertation. Toward the end of the second year of study, the student should formulate a tentative dissertation topic. Three faculty members proposed by the Department and appointed on behalf of the Dean of Graduate Studies and the Graduate Council constitute the Doctoral Committee which directs the preparation and comple\u00ad tion of the dissertation. The Doctoral Committee certifies that a German 215 compieted dissertation is satisfactory through the signature of the Committee members on the signature page of the dissertation.

The Department presents a variety of approaches to history, and each emphasizes basic disci\u00ad plinary skills: weighing evidence, constructing logical arguments, and exploring the role of theory in historical analysis and human action. The Department offers a number of lower-division courses open to nonmajors as well as majors, most of which fulfill part of the UCI breadth requirement. The Department requires all majors to take a survey course in world history, United States history, European history, Latin American history, or East Asian history. These courses are also open to nonmajors. Students who are interested in the study of history but are majoring in other disciplines may minor in History. The minor incorporates elements of the Department's program for majors but allows stu\u00ad dents enough flexibility to pursue programs in other departments and schools. Upper-division courses range from the examination of individual nation-states (e.g., Chinese history), to studies of the relations am_ong nation-states (e.g., European International History), to his\u00ad toncal analyses of political, socio-economic, and cultural factors (e.g., Women in the United States). Students are also provided the opportunity for small-group learning experiences in a series of col\u00ad loquia in social history, political history, international history, intel\u00ad lectual history, social thought, and comparative history. The collo\u00ad quia are conducted as discussion groups and involve close reading and analysis of secondary texts. The research seminar is a one\u00ad quarter seminar in primary materials that culminates in the writing of a research paper. The faculty encourages History majors and minors to study abroad and experience a different culture while making progress toward their UCI degree. The Center for International Education, which includes the Education Abroad Program (EAP) and the Interna\u00ad tional Opportunities Program (lOP), assists students in taking advantage of the many worldwide opportunities that can provide other perspectives on history. See the Center for International Edu\u00ad cation section of the Catalogue or your academic counselor for addition~! information. CARI;ERS FOR THE HISTORY MAJOR The training and discipline derived from historical studies provide a valuable experience for all educated persons seeking to under\u00ad stand themselves and their World. Many students who complete undergraduate degrees in the Department of History go on to grad\u00ad uate school in a variety of fields, including history, law, business, international relations, and teacher education. The study of history is valua?le preparation for many other careers as well. The strong academic and professional orientation acquired by History majors is necessary to pursue successful careers in such diverse fields as advertising, banking, journalism, management, public relations, publishing, and government service. The Career and Life Planning Center provides services to UCI stu\u00ad dents and alumni including career counseling, information about job opportunities, a career library, and workshops on resume preparation, job search, and interview techniques. See the Career and Life Planning Center section for additional information. History 217 REQUIREMENTS FOR THE BACHELOR'S DEGREE University Requirements: See pages 57-61. School Requirements: See page 190. Departmental Requirements for the Major Fourteen courses are required: a year-long survey selected from world history (History 21A, 21B, 21C), United States history (His\u00ad European history (History Latin American history (History 42A, history (History 43A, 43B, 43C); five upper-division History courses; two colloquia (History 190), one of which is followed by a research seminar (History 192); and three additional lower-or upper-division History courses. If a student has satisfied the survey requirement with United States or European history, then at least two of the other required History courses selected must deal with Latin American, East Asian, Mid\u00ad dle Eastern, North African, or world history. Conversely, if a stu\u00ad dent has satisfied the survey requirement with Latin American or East Asian history, then at least two of the other required History courses selected must deal with United States or European history. Residence Requirement for the Major: Three history courses, a colloquium, and a research seminar must be completed success\u00ad fully at UCI. Departmental Requirements for the Minor Seven courses are required: a year-long survey in world history (History 21A, 21B, 21C), United States history (History 40A, 40B, 40C), European history (History 41A, 41B, 41C), Latin American history Asian history (History 43A, 43B, 43C), or Crises and Revolutions (History 50, three different topics required); and four upper-division History courses. Residence Requirement for the Minor: At least four upper-divi\u00ad sion History courses must be completed successfully at UCI. Graduate Program The graduate program leading to the M.A. and Ph.D. degrees in History is designed to provide students with both advanced histori\u00ad cal skills and a rigorous grounding in historical theory. This combi\u00ad nation of theoretical study with training in historical method reflects the Department's conviction that scholars should be encouraged to deal with significant questions about the past and to approach these questions in a methodologically sophisticated way. This approach requires that the student develop the critical abilities necessary to deal with primary sources, secondary syntheses, and the interrelationship of history and theory. Candidates for an advanced degree in History are expected to gain teaching experi\u00ad ence as an integral part of their graduate training. Ordinarily this is accomplished through service as a Teaching Assistant. Basic to the curriculum is the Department's course in History and Theory which deals with poth theoretical texts and historical stud\u00ad ies that have utilized theoretical concepts and models. The course directs attention to the diverse implications of modernity, to the groups who dominated and were dominated by it, and to the costs and benefits of the process. These matters can be studied most sat\u00ad isfactorily by the historian whose theoretical self-consciousness and methodological facility have been systematically and carefully developed. The colloquium, a reading course that examines a field's chief his\u00ad torical works, enriches the student's knowledge of the main areas of historical research and develops critical reading skills. Collo\u00ad quium series are offered yearly in American history and modern European history, biannually (depending on demand) in early mod\u00ad ern European history, Latin American history, East Asian history, and ancient history, and occasionally in medieval history. A student may prepare a dissertation in any of these fields. UC IRVINE - 1996-1997I 218 UCI 1996-97 School of Humanities In addition to the History and Theory sequence and the major field colloquia, students also take a proseminar/research seminar sequence during their first year. The proseminar provides an orien\u00ad tation to the literature on a broad historical subject, and the associ\u00ad ated seminar offers guidance in research and writing on problems within this broad area. Students awarded M.A. degrees at other institutions before entering the graduate program at UCI may be exempted from this requirement, subject to evaluation of their M.A. theses. During the second year of study, Ph.D. students normally take a colloquium series in their second field. They also take a two-quar\u00ad ter research seminar where they have an opportunity to work on problems of their own choosing; students who entered the program with an M.A. degree must also take this seminar. In addition, inde\u00ad pendent reading and research courses are provided for advanced, specialized study in tutorial form. The immediate objective for the doctoral student is to develop two fields of competence in, addition to History and Theory. Compe\u00ad tence in the two fields is demonstrated by the satisfactory comple\u00ad tion of three courses in each of these areas. A comprehensive oral examination on the student's major field follows fulfillment of all degree requirements. However, those students who elect a second field administered by another program or department (e.g., Critical Theory) must complete requirements, which sometimes include a written examination, for that field. Competence in History and Theory is demonstrated by satisfactory completion of History 200A and 200B. History 200C may be taken as an elective. The subsequent objective, to write a distinctive dissertation, is of crucial importance. To assist in accomplishing both objectives, the Department offers intensive consultation with the faculty as well as a lively intellectual atmosphere. Students have long shared in the decision-making processes of the Department, which engages the entire historical community at UCI in the collective pursuit of excellence. Students profit also from a vigorous visiting speakers program that brings scholars from other campuses and other nations to meet and interact with UCI students and faculty. MASTER OF ARTS IN HISTORY Requirements for Admission. Although it is desirable that an applicant have the equivalent of an undergraduate major in History, the Department also accepts students who have previously special\u00ad ized in other subject areas and who show promise of sustained and self-disciplined work in history. Typically, a minimum undergradu\u00ad ate grade point average of 3.3 (B+) is required for admission, with evidence of better work in history. In addition, all applicants are asked to submit three letters of recommendation and scores from the Graduate Record Examination. An example of written work in history from undergraduate courses is also required. Students are accepted for admission for fall quarter only, and the deadline for application for fall admission is February 1. Program of Study. The M.A. program emphasizes the theoretical and historiographical dimensions of history. Each candidate for the M.A. will choose a graduate advisor who will supervise the stu\u00ad dent's program. Nine courses are required for the degree: two in History and Theory (History 200A and 200B), three in a collo\u00ad quium series, three in proseminars (or two in proseminars and one in History 200C), and one in a related first-year research seminar. Students intending to pursue the Ph.D. should begin at once to delineate doctoral interests in order to fit their work for the M.A. into the total program. Language Requirement. Normally a reading knowledge of one foreign language is required for the M.A. degree. Students in American history, with an advisor's permission, may substitute a one-quarter departmental course in quantitative methods for the M.A. foreign language requirement. Language competency is demonstrated by passing a departmental examination administered by a faculty member proficient in the chosen language. Comprehensive Examination. At the end of the final quarter the M.A. candidate must pass a comprehensive oral examination cov\u00ad ering the student's major field (e.g., America, Early Modem Europe) and focusing upon material assigned in the three-quarter ) colloquium series. Time Limits. The M.A. requires a minimum of one year in acade\u00ad mic residence and must be completed in no more than two years of graduate study. DOCTOR OF PHILOSOPHY IN HISTORY Requirements for Admission. Applicants submit transcripts, three letters of recommendation, aptitude scores from the Graduate Record Examination, and a sample of written work. In addition, a departmental interview may be required. Ph.D. students are advised to begin their graduate work at UCI, since. those who have taken the M.A. elsewhere will be expected to enroll in the same courses that are required of all incoming stu\u00ad dents, with the exception of the First-Year Research Seminar. Sub\u00ad ject to evaluation of their M.A. theses, these students will be exempted from this requirement. In the second and third years, the greater experience of those who enter with an M.A. may work to advantage in speeding them to the qualifying examination. To be admitted formally into the doctoral program, students must satisfactorily pass a departmental evaluation at the end of their first year of study; this includes students who entered with an M.A. from another institution. Incoming students are admitted for fall quarter only, and the dead\u00ad line for application for fall admission is February 1. Art History. A concentration in Art History, leading to the Ph.D. degree in History, is available through the Departments of Art His\u00ad tory arid History. Information is available in the Department of Art History section of the Catalogue. Feminist Studies. A graduate emphasis in Feminist Studies also is available. Refer to the Women's Studies section of the Catalogue for information. Program of Study. The Department requires doctoral students to prepare themselves in three different areas: 1. History and Theory. 2. The first field (such as Modem Europe), which is designed as a teaching field as well as the focus of the student's dissertation. 3. The second field (such as American History or Critical Theory), which is designed as a second teaching field. The courses required in this preparation include the History and Theory sequence, colloquium series in both fields, First-Year Pros\u00ad eminar/Research Seminar sequence, and the Second-Year Research Seminar. The normal academic load is three courses per quarter. However, applicants may be eligible for approved part-time status, which allows students to take a lighter course load at reduced fees for a maximum of two academic years. Every doctoral student will be assisted by a departmental advisor in the student's general area of study who will be responsible for approving defined fields, guiding the student to consultant faculty, and supervising the examination. Language Requirements. All students, except as specified below, must demonstrate a reading knowledge of two foreign languages prior to taking the Ph.D. candidacy qualifying examination. Com\u00ad petency in a language may be established either by passing a departmental examination or through extensive language use in one of the research seminars. The specific languages that may be used to satisfy this requirement depend on the student's first field. UC IRVINE - 1996-1997Students in American history may use a substitute for one of their languages. They may take either the Department's graduate course in quantitative methods or two graduate courses in an allied disci\u00ad pline (e.g., critical theory, political theory, cultural anthropology, feminist theory, art history linguistics). Students pursuing the sec\u00ad ond option are expected to write a substantial paper that demon\u00ad strates the value of the allied discipline to historical inquiry. The two courses for the second option may not count toward fulfilling the requirement for the second field. Qualifying Examination and Dissert~tion. In preparation \"for the oral Qualifying Examination, the student will present to the Ph.D. Candidacy Committee a portfolio of three papers totaling at least 45 pages on subjects related to the major field. Su9cessful comple\u00ad tion of this examination results in the student's advancement to Ph.D. candidacy. Within one academic quarter of the oral examina\u00ad tion, new candidates must meet in a colloquy with their Doctoral Committee to present their dissertation proposal. Once the Doc\u00ad toral Committee approves the proposal, the student begins inten\u00ad sive work upon the dissertation. The research and writing involved in this effort are expected to require from one to three years. At the end of this period an oral defense of the dissertation normally will be held, focusing on the adequacy of the student's research and thesis. Students who enter with normal academic preparation and pursue a full-time program of study should be able to earn the Ph.D. degree within six years.

SPECIAL PROGRAMS Undergraduate Major in Humanities The interdisciplinary major in Humanities is one of the many options available to a student who wants to select a major in the School of Humanities. As such, the major in Humanities is on a par with the major in Spanish, the major in Classics, the major in Phi\u00ad losophy, and other majors in the School. The major in Humanities accommodates students who want to organize their undergraduate education around a humanistic perspective on a topic, a field, or a problem which is interdisciplinary in scope (e.g., Literature anq Politics in Twentieth-Century America; The Problem of Commu\u00ad nity; Social and Religious Thought in the Age of the Reformation); Italian Society and Culture. The student enters the program at the end of the sophomore year and, in consultation with the Humani\u00ad ties Major Committee, devises an individually tailored set of \"major requirements,\" not all of which need be offered in the School of Humanities. The Committee will assign an advisor on the basis of the student's own preference, if possible. At the end of the senior year the student will prepare, under the advisor's super\u00ad vision, a long paper (40-50 pages) in the area ()f the special major. This requirement is satisfied by taking Humanities 199. A student majoring in the Humanities must also meet the regular School, UCI, and University requirements for graduation. Inquiries by UC IRVINE - 1996-1997I 224 UCI 1996-97 School of Humanities third-quarter sophomores should be addressed to the Senior Acade\u00ad mic Counselor in the School's Office of Undergraduate Study.

Ph.D. with Interdisciplinary Emphasis in Humanities The School of Humanities offers no degree called the Ph.D. in Humanities. However, some Ph.D. students in regular programs in the School may elect an interdisciplinary modification of their degree with the permission of the departments or programs con\u00ad cerned. Such students will do about 60 percent of their graduate work in a major field and about 40 percent in one or more minor fields. Those interested in an interdisciplinary degree should con\u00ad tact the Associate Dean for Graduate Studies or the Graduate Advi\u00ad sor in their major department. Emphasis in Critical Theory 200 Humanities Office Building; (714) 824-6712 Alexander Gelley, Director Committee on Critical Theory Harold Baker, Assistant Professor of Russian Stephen Barker, Associate Dean of the School of the Arts, Director of Ans Interdisciplinary, Department Chair (Acting) of Studio An, and Associate Professor of Drama Lindon W.

Hillis Miller, UCI Distinguished Professor of English and Comparative Literature Gonzalo Navajas, Professor of Spanish Jane Newman, Associate Professor of Comparative Literature Margo Norris, Professor of English and Comparative Literature Mark Poster, Professor of History and of Information and Computer Science Leslie Rabine, Professor of French Gabriele Schwab, Professor of English and Comparative Literature David W. Smith, Professor of Philosophy John H. Smith, Associate Professor of German Brook Thomas, Depanment Chair of English and Professor of English Juan Villegas, Research Professor of Spanish Andrzej Warminski, Professor of Comparative Literature Linda Williams, Director of the Program in Film Studies and Professor of Film Studies An emphasis in Critical Theory, under the supervision of the Com\u00ad mittee on Critical Theory, is available for doctoral students in all departments of the School of Humanities. Ph.D. students may, with Committee approval, complete the emphasis in addition to the degree requirements of their graduate program. Although there is no change in the existing Ph.D. program requirements or procedures, if the student wishes to have a letter (signed by the Dean and by the Director of Critical Theory) testifying that the student has satisfac\u00ad torily added this theoretical dimension to the graduate program, then additional requirements must be met. Critical theory at UCI is understood in the broad sense as the study of the shared assump\u00ad tions, problems, and commitments of the various discourses in the humanities. The faculty regards critical theory not as an adjunct to the study of one of the traditional humanistic disciplines but as a necessary context for the study of any humanistic discipline. Requirements for the emphasis are: a three-quarter Critical Theory Workshop, three Humanities 270 courses offered under the super\u00ad vision of the Committee on Critical Theory, participation in two mini-seminars (six to eight hours) offered by visiting scholars and sponsored by the Committee, and a research paper written under the guidance of a three-member committee selected by each indi\u00ad vidual student in consultation with the Director. Emphasis in the History and Philosophy of Science 220 Humanities Office Building 2; (714) 824-6565 Brian Skyrms, Director An emphasis in the history and philosophy of science is available for doctoral students in the Departments of History and Philoso\u00ad phy. The emphasis is administered by the Committee on the His\u00ad tory and Philosophy of Science. It provides a means for doctoral students to supplement their general studies in history and philoso\u00ad phy with specific studies directed toward the natural and social sci\u00ad ences. It also allows history of science and philosophy of science students to broaden their knowledge of each other's fields. The history of science encompasses such topics as how science is actually done and how it has been influenced by and has influ\u00ad enced other aspects of culture. The history of science has recently proven a very active and influential field of historical research. It has changed many assumptions about science and mathematics in a way that has deeply influenced the philosophy of science and has arguably influenced the practices of the sciences themselves. The philosophy of science includes such topics as the nature of sci\u00ad entific explanation, the role of logic and language in science and mathematics, the problems inherent in inductive or ampliative inference, the cognitive and epistemic status of scientific laws and theories, and the nature of empirical evidence and its role in theory construction. Students in the emphasis study various ways to assess the epistemological foundations of scientific and mathematical inquiry, account for the apparent successes of the sciences, and resolve problems of philosophical interest that arise within the con\u00ad text of particular sciences. Students are required to take three graduate-level courses in the history of science and three in the philosophy of science, as well as fulfill special examination and dissertation requirements. Addi\u00ad tional information concerning the emphasis is available from the Director. GRADUATE COURSES Graduate courses in flumanities are under the direction of the School's Associate Dean for Graduate Studies and are designed for all graduate students in the School of Humanities. Humanities 200 and 220 introduce study in various disciplinary areas, either to students planning a degree in history or one of the UC IRVINE - 1996-1997literature departments or to those seeking familiarity with disci\u00ad plines other than their own.

Walsh, M.B.B.S., Ph.D. University of Queensland, Professor of Psychiatry and Human Behavior; Philosophy, and Anthropology Philosophy addresses itself to questions that arise insistently in every area of human experience and in every discipline within the university. Each discipline inevitably poses problems concerning the nature of the standards appropriate to it and the place of its subject matter within the total framework of human knowledge. If we are to understand science or art or literature, or such human practices as religion and moral thought, we are bound to address ourselves to philosophical issues relating to their nature, the uses of reason appropriate to them, and the contributions they make to our understanding and appreciation of ourselves and the world in which we live. \u00b7 CAREERS FOR THE PHILOSOPHY MAJOR The study of argument and the precision and clarity of thought and writing required of Philosophy majors are excellent preparation for a variety of careers. Many undergraduates trained in Philosophy go on to professional schools in medicine, business, or law. The ana\u00ad lytical skills developed in Philosophy courses are especially useful . in legal education; indeed, many UCI Philosophy graduates have been successful at top law schoolS. Former Philosophy students have also used their skills to advantage in careers in government, business, teaching . law enforcement, and computer programming. Many Philosophy majors also continue their education at the grad\u00ad uate level, either in philosophy or a related discipline. The Career and Life Planning Center provides services to UCI stu\u00ad dents and alumni including career counseling, information about job opportunities, a career library, and workshops on resume preparation, job search, and interview techniques. See the Career and Life Planning Center section for additional information. Undergraduate Program Instruction in philosophy relies essentially upon discussion in which students are active participants. Wherever possible, there\u00ad fore, classes are severely limited in size in order to permit sus\u00ad tained interchanges between students and instructor. Some of the courses offered are of general interest to all students. Others are designed to explore issues that arise in selected and spe\u00ad cial disciplines such as art or science. The undergraduate advisor should be consulted for advice about courses best suited to the spe\u00ad cialized needs of particular students. The program of course offerings is also designed for those majors in philosophy whose intention may be either to enter some profes\u00ad sional school upon graduation (e.g., law) or to engage in graduate work in philosophy. UC IRVINE - 1996-1997I 228 UCI 1996-:97 School of Humanities REQUIREMENTS FOR THE BACHELOR'S DEGREE University Requirements: See pages 57-61. School Requirements: See page 190. Departmental Requirements for the Major Philosophy 30A-B, 10, 12, and either 11 or 13; Philosophy 101, 102, 103, and five additional quarter courses from Philosophy 100, 105-199. Students planning to go on to graduate school are strongly advised to take Philosophy 105A and 105B. Residence Requirement: At least five upper-division courses required for the major must be completed successfully at UCI. Departmental Requirements for the Minor The minor consists of two portions: a lower-division portion and an upper-division portion. Both must be satisfied. Lower division: Three courses selected from Philosophy 1, 4, 5, 30A or three courses selected from Philosophy 1, 6, 7, 30A or three courses selected from Philosophy 10, 11, 12, 13, 30A. Upper division: Four courses in a given subfield of philosophy, some of which have been pre-approved by the Department and are included below: History of Philosophy (Philosophy 110--117); Metaphysics and Epistemology (Philosophy 120--124); Value The\u00ad 115, 140-148). Other four-course sequences may be possible, subject to written permission by the Department. Such a sequence must consist of related courses in a coherent subfield. Residence Requirement for the Minor: Four upper-division courses must be successfully completed at UCI. Graduate Program Students are encouraged to seek the counsel of any and all mem\u00ad bers of the Department whose recommendations the student would deem helpful. It is hoped that there will be a close intellectual rela\u00ad tionship between graduate students and professors in order to pro\u00ad vide the students with optimum conditions for philosophical devel\u00ad opment and to expedite their progress toward advanced degrees. In addition, the Department sponsors a series of colloquia each year. Participation in these colloquia is an important part of the graduate student's training. Every new graduate student is assigned a faculty member whose purpose is to oversee the student's progress through the major requirements for the advanced degree. The student consults with the faculty each quarter about progress and any administrative or academic difficulties. Each student's overall record is evaluated by the Department each year, customarily during the first two weeks of April. When the student has satisfied residency, tools of research, logic, and portfolio requirements, the Candidacy Com\u00ad mittee supervises the qualifying examination and the development of a dissertation project, and the subsequent writing of the disserta\u00ad tion itself. The Chair of this committee is the principal person with whom the graduate student will consult on the dissertation. MASTER OF ARTS IN PHILOSOPHY There is no list of courses required for the M.A. degree. The M.A. program in Philosophy takes one year at a minimum. The student may elect to follow either of the following routes to the degree: write a thesis on a subject to be chosen in consultation with an advisor and defend the thesis in an oral examination, or satisfy the Logic and Portfolio requirements for the Ph.D. degree. Please refer to the Research and Graduate Studies section for information on the minimum number of courses required for the M.A. degree. Advancement to candidacy for the M.A. degree is not automatic, but requires formal application to the Dean of Graduate Studies via the Philosophy Department Office. Application must be made with the recommendation of the Philosophy Department and must take place before the beginning of the quarter in which the student expects to receive the degree. DOCTOR OF PHILOSOPHY IN PHILOSOPHY There is no set number of courses required for the Ph.D., so that work can be tailored to the individual student's needs and interests. However, as a prerequisite for the Ph.D. degree, every student is required to have some experience in teaching. The Ph.D. program is designed to take five years for the normally qualified student. In exceptional cases it may be possible to obtain the degree within four years. A Master's degree is not a prerequi\u00ad site for the Ph.D. The following items are requirements for the Ph.D. degree. Distribution Requirements. Students are required to take a range of courses designed to expose them to the various historical peri\u00ad ods and fields of philosophy. No particular courses are required; when course offerings are announced, students are notified about which courses can be used to satisfy which requirements. In some cases, the requirement satisfied will ultimately depend on the con\u00ad tent of the student's term paper(s). The Distribution Requirements are: 1. History. To satisfy this requirement, students must receive a grade of B or better in at least four courses covering at least three of the following five historical periods: Ancient, Medieval, Modem, Kant and Nineteenth Century, and Twentieth Century. 2. Field. To satisfy this requirement, students must receive a grade of B or better in two courses in value theory and one course each in metaphysics and epistemology. These requirements must be completed by the end of the seventh quarter in residence. Logic Requirement. Students entering the program are expected to be familiar with elementary propositional and quantificational logic, including natural deduction techniques for both. A student with a weak background may wish to audit the lower-division courses Philosophy 30A and 30B or review the material in an inde\u00ad pendent study course (299) under the supervision of individual fac\u00ad ulty members. Given that background, to satisfy the Logic Requirement, students must receive a grade of B or better in Philosophy 205A and 205B. The first of these covers the language and techniques of elemen\u00ad tary set theory: basic operations with sets, relations and functions, natural numbers and mathematical induction, and cardinal num\u00ad bers. The second covers basic proof theory and model theory of first-order logic, including the deduction theorem, soundness and completeness theorems, compactness, and Lowenheim-Skolem the\u00ad orems. These courses are devised to provide students with (a) the tools to assess logic-based arguments in the contemporary litera\u00ad ture, and (b) a firm foundation on the basis of which students can explore further logical topics as their area of concentration requires. This requirement must be completed by the end of the seventh quarter in residence. Tools of Research. This requirement allows students to pursue the tool which they and their advisors deem most useful for their area of concentration, either a foreign language or some course of study outside philosophy. To satisfy this requirement, a student must pass an examination in a single appropriate foreign language or receive a grade of B or better in each of three appropriate graduate-level courses in a discipline other than philosophy. The two-hour foreign language examination (administered by the Philosophy Department) requires students to translate, with the aid of a dictionary, passages from one or two philosophical authors. For the second option, courses of study outside philosophy will be UC IRVINE - 1996-1997approved (by the Director of Graduate Studies) when they bear on a student's area of philosophical concentration. Though the courses must be in a discipline other than philosophy, they may in fact be taught in the Philosophy Department (e.g., a course in mathemati\u00ad cal logic taught by a Philosophy faculty member). This requirement must be completed by the end of the ninth quar\u00ad ter in residence. The Portfolio. A portfolio is an extended writing sample designed to demonstrate a student's ability (a) to understand, analyze, and evaluate positions and arguments in classical and contemporary philosophical literature, and (b) to formulate and defend an origi\u00ad nal philosophical thesis. These virtues must be displayed at a level of sophistication that indicates the student's ability to write a Ph.D. dissertation. The portfolio must be submitted to the Graduate Coordinator at the end of the fourth week of the student's seventh quarter in residence. Candidacy Examination. In preparation for the Candidacy Exami\u00ad nation, students consult with their thesis advisor and other appro\u00ad priate faculty to prepare a reading list on their area of concentra\u00ad tion and a brief dissertation proposal. Students apply for candidacy by filing appropriate forms, including a list (devised in consulta\u00ad tion with their advisor) of appropriate members for their Candi\u00ad dacy Committee; one of these, the External Examiner, must come from outside the School of Humanities. The Committee is then appointed by the Department, on behalf of the Dean of Graduate Studies and the Graduate Council, to administer the oral Candidacy Examination on the reading list and proposal to determine whether or not the student is prepared to begin work on the dissertation. This requirement must be completed by the end of the ninth quar\u00ad ter in residence. The Department Chair, on behalf of the Dean of Graduate Studies and the Graduate Council, then appoints a Doc\u00ad toral Committee (typically taken from the Candidacy Committee and naturally including the dissertation advisor) to supervise the writing of the dissertation. Dissertation Defense. Students must defend their dissertation dur\u00ad ing an oral examination administered by their Doctoral Committee. THE SALZBURG EXCHANGE PROGRAM Both faculty and graduate students participate in this exchange of scholars between the University of Salzburg and the UCI Philoso\u00ad phy Department. To be eligible, students must have advanced to candidacy. Students who are selected spend one semester in Salzburg and teach one course in the general area of their disserta\u00ad tion topic. An upper-division course may be taught in English, but lower-division courses must be taught in German. (Some previous visitors have learned serviceable German by attending a Goethe institute during the preceding summer.) Typically, a Salzburg visi\u00ad tor receives a Salzburg Fellowship intended to cover travel expenses, and a stipend; those who teach while in Salzburg also receive a salary intended to cover living expenses (including health and dental insurance). EMPHASIS IN CRITICAL THEORY The School of Humanities offers an Emphasis in Critical Theory. Students may petition the Critical Theory Committee for admission to the emphasis, normally by the middle of the second year of graduate study, after completing the Critical Theory Workshop, and with the recommendation of a workshop instructor or a faculty rep\u00ad resentative from Philosophy. In addition to the requirements for the Ph.D. in Philosophy, students must satisfy the following requirements: 1) The Workshop. Students must successfully complete the three\u00ad quarter Critical Theory Workshop. This sequence is conceived as a reading group, normally conducted by a team of instructors, and developed with the input of all participants. Significant texts Philosophy 229 are discussed and analyzed in class; no term papers are required. (Students receive 0 units and In-progress grades for the fall and winter quarters; passing students receive 4 units and a Satisfac\u00ad tory grade for the spring quarter. 2) Advanced Critical Theory. Students must receive a grade of B or better in three Humanities 270 courses offered under the super\u00ad vision of the Critical Theory Committee. At least three such courses will be offered each year. With the approval of the Department, these courses can be used to satisfy the Tools of Research requirement. 3) Students must participate in two committee-sponsored mini\u00ad seminars (six-eight hours each) offered by visiting scholars on their ongoing research. 4) Students must complete a research paper under the guidance of a three-member committee, selected in consultation with the Director of the Emphasis; at least one member must be from outside of the Philosophy Department. This paper may (but need not) be part of the portfolio or dissertation. Upon completion of the Emphasis requirements, a letter certifying that fact, signed by the Dean of Humanities and the Director of the Emphasis, will be added to the student's dossier. EMPHASIS IN HISTORY AND PHILOSOPHY OF SCIENCE An interdisciplinary group of faculty in the humanities and various sciences offers an emphasis in History and Philosophy of Science. In addition to the requirements for the Ph.D. in Philosophy, stu\u00ad dents must satisfy the following requirements: 1) History of Science. Students receive a grade of B or better in History 275 and two sections of independent readings in the his\u00ad tory of science, which are often offered in conjunction with an upper-division undergraduate section of History 135A-F. With the approval of the Department, this sequence can be used to satisfy the Tools of Research Requirement. 2) Philosophy of Science. Students must receive a grade of B or better in three courses from the following list: Philosophy 205C, 206, 240, 245, 247. (These may be repeated as topics vary, except Philosophy 205C.) 3) The portfolio must contain at least one paper in the philosophy of science. 4) The dissertation must contain a significant philosophy of science component. With the recommendation of a Department of Phi\u00ad losophy faculty member of the History and Philosophy of Sci\u00ad ence Committee, the dissertation proposal may be submitted to the Committee for approval. EMPHASIS IN LOGIC AND METHODOLOGY An interdisciplinary group of faculty in the humanities and various sciences offers an emphasis in Logic and Methodology. This Emphasis is offered for students who wish to study topics related to logic, the philosophy of mathematics or logic, or the philosophy of science. In addition to the requirements for the Ph.D. in Philoso\u00ad phy, students must satisfy the following requirements: 1) Mathematics or Science. Students must receive a grade of B or better in three graduate-level courses in mathematics or in the same science which have methodological content. With the approval of the Department, these courses can be used to satisfy the Tools of Research Requirement. Students may elect to sat\u00ad isfy a more stringent requirement (the math track) by taking a series of at least six mathematics courses either at UCI or at UCLA through the Intercampus Exchange Program. The courses are selected in consultation with the student's UCI Philosophy advisor. Regular mathematics department qualifying examina\u00ad tions may be substituted for some of the course work. UC IRVINE - 1996-1997230 UCI 1996-97 School of Humanities 2) Philosophy of Science. Students must receive a grade of B or better in three courses from the following list: Philosophy 205C, 206, 240, 245, 247. (These may be repeated as topics vary, except Philosophy 205C.) Courses used to satisfy this require\u00ad ment cannot also be used to satisfy requirement 1. 3) The portfolio must contain at least one paper in logic, the phi\u00ad losophy of mathematics or logic, or the philosophy of science. 4) The dissertation must contain a significant logic, philosophy of mathematics or logic, or philosophy of science component.

Green, Director Faculty Harold Baker, Ph.D. Brown University, Assistant Professor of Russian (comparative literature, critical theory, literature and visual culture, Tolstoy, Mandelstam) Guy de Mallac, Ph.D. Cornell University, Professor Emeritus of Russian (modem Russian literature, peace studies, philosophy of nonviolence, Tolstoy's thought, Gandhi's thought, religious studies, Russian intellectual thought, Pasternak's life and work) Michael A. Green, Ph.D. University of California, Los Angeles, Director of the Program in Russian and Associate Professor of Russian (eighteenth\u00ad century Russian theatre and literary theory, Pushkin, Chekhov, Kuzmin, Russian Symbolist theaier, cabaret theatre, Russian literature and theater of the 1920s) Victorina Lefebvre, Ph.D. Lomonosov Moscow State University, Lecturer (methods of teaching, comparative study of Western and Soviet culture, Russian language and literature) The Program in Russian provides a coherent course of undergradu\u00ad ate studies in Russian language, culture, and society, yet is flexible and dynamic enough to respond to students' individual needs and interests, as well as to changes in Russia itself. The Program emphasizes undergraduate research, which is required of all Russ\u00ad ian majors. Russian majors and students from outside the Program are exposed to the elements of Russian literature, culture, and area studies through a range of courses taught in English and, as a rule, without prerequisites. The Russian Culture course (Russian 50) focuses on UC IRVINE - 1996-1997particular issues of Russian culture and society. Student input is actively solicited in the development of new topics for this course. The final year of study for Russian majors includes, along with continuing language study, a sequence of experiences culminating in an independent undergraduate research project overseen by one or more faculty members. This advanced stage of the curriculum involves intensive training in reading original Russian sources and a guided group reading course in which the participants explore potential research topics. In appropriate cases, the Program will seek to place fourth-year students as interns in faculty-generated research projects dealing with Russia. It is also possible to complete a Russian minor by studying the Russian language through the third year and taking a selection of other Program courses. All students in Russian language courses are encouraged to take part in the University's Education Abroad Program and spend a portion of their junior or senior year studying in Russia. Additional information is available in the Center for International Education section of this Catalogue. REQUIREMENTS FOR THE BACHELOR'S DEGREE University Requirements: See pages 57-61. School Requirements: See page 190. Program Requirements for the Russian Major Russian lOOA-B-C, 101A-B-C, 150, 151, 152; 50 must be taken three times, with three different topics; either 191, 192, and 193, or a year-long research commitment, inside or outside the Pro\u00ad gram, approved by the Program (Russian 195A-B-C). Residence Requirement for the Major: At least five upper-divi\u00ad sion courses required for the major must be completed successfully at UCI. Program Requirements for the Russian Minor Russian lOOA-B-C; Russian 50 must be taken two times, with two different topics; two additional courses offered by the Program, one of which must be an upper-division course and one of which may be an additional Russian 50 with a different topic. Residence Requirement for the Minor: Fou.r upper-division courses must be successfully completed at UCI. PLANNING A PROGRAM OF STUDY The Program in Russian believes in close consultation with stu\u00ad dents on academic advising, program planning, and discussion of goals and direction. Students should schedule a formal meeting with their advisor at least once per year, usually during Orientation Week before the beginning of classes in the fall, to review course choices and progress toward degree completion. More generally, the Program faculty can provide full information and consultation on graduate school, study and work opportunities abroad, and the full range of outside programs. In addition, a file of companies and organizations having contacts with Russia is maintained to assist students seeking internships or employment. CAREER OPPORTUNITIES Russian is not a pre-professional program, but rather a humanistic discipline. Its goals, similar to those of other humanistic disci\u00ad plines, are to increase knowledge of the world and human society, develop the intellectual skills of analysis and criticism, deepen communicative abilities and sensibilities, clarify values and con\u00ad flicts of values, and, in general, problematize the human condition, render vivid and dramatic its peculiar responsibilities and creative potential. Russian is distinct from other humanistic disciplines in being centered on a particular object of knowledge-Russia, its Russian 233 culture, history, and society-and a particular central skill-knowl\u00ad edge of the Russian language. The faculty believe that a UCI graduate with a degree in Russian is a broadly educated, intellectually and culturally empowered indi\u00ad vidual who will be valuable in any undertaking or enterprise, by virtue of both a specific knowledge of Russia and Russian and a general capacity for independent, productive thought and activity. Graduates with an excellent academic record should be good can\u00ad didates for postgraduate professional training of all kinds and espe\u00ad cially for those with strong verbal and analytical requirements, such as law, business, and public administration. During the twentieth century, Russia has become one of the world's dominant political, cultural, and economic entities. Due to the peculiar relationship of antagonism that has existed between Russia and the United States through most of this century, most career possibilities using Russian in this country have been in gov\u00ad ernment, and specifically in the foreign policy, national security, intelligence, and defense establishments. In recent years, the relationship of antagonism has ended, but Rus\u00ad sia's importance in the world has not been essentially altered. While the demand for specialists in various sectors of government has eased, relationships between our countries at other levels of society are growing more active. Particular areas in which the need for Russian language and cultural competence are particularly evi\u00ad dent right now include trade, environmental protection, social ser\u00ad vices, law, medicine, and technology. However, this picture may evolve in the years ahead, Russia's natural and human resources and its geopolitical centrality guarantee it a continuing dominant importance in all of the United States' international relationships, particularly its economic ones. Russian is, of course, also a properly academic specialty, and the need for teachers and researchers in Russian at all levels continues to be strong. In recent years, Russian has been the second fastest\u00ad growing language in American colleges and universities. It also continues to be taught at a significant number of secondary schools. Students with very strong achievement in Russian lan\u00ad guage competence, as well as broad humanistic interests in cultural and literary or linguistic studies, should consult with the Program faculty on the possibility of applying to graduate school. A variety of higher academic disciplines involve the knowledge of Russian, including Slavic Languages and Literatures, Russian and East European Area Studies, and others. In addition to the counseling resources provided by the Program in Russian, the Career and Life Planning Center provides services to UCI students and alumni including career counseling, information about job opportunities, a career library, and workshops on resume preparation, job search, and interview techniques.

Students are placed in Spanish courses according to their years of previous study. In general, one year of high school Spanish is equated with one quarter of UCI work. Thus, students with one, two, three, and four years of high school Spanish will enroll in Spanish IB, lC, 2A, and 2B, respectively. Exceptions to this place\u00ad ment formula must be approved by the appropriate course director. Students with transfer credit for college-level Spanish may not repeat those courses for credit. All courses in Spanish and Portuguese, unless specifically stated, are taught in the foreign language. By the end of the first year, stu\u00ad dents attain mastery of the basic structure of the language and abil\u00ad ity to converse on everyday topics as well as to read and write on an elementary level. In the second year, emphasis is put on gradually raising the level of the student's ability to read and write. A third-year two-quarter sequential course stresses composition and introduction to literary analysis. Further, a course in phonetics perfects pronunciation and UC IRVINE - 1996-1997presents historical and dialect variants of Spanish. The introductory courses in literature, also in the third year, emphasize the analysis and appreciation of complete literary works rather than the study of many short selections of innumerable authors in an anthology. The courses in Hispanic civilization combine a panoramic over\u00ad view with a close look at a specific country or topic. Although a major in Portuguese is not offered, advanced literature courses are available. In addition, an undergraduate minor is offered. The faculty encourages Spanish majors or minors who are serious about improving their Spanish language ability in reading, writing, and speaking to take advantage of opportunities to immerse them\u00ad selves in the Spanish language by studying in Chile, Costa Rica, Mexico, Spain, or other Spanish-speaking countries through the Education Abroad Program (EAP) or through the International Opportunities Program (lOP). Programs are available for the sum\u00ad mer, one quarter, one semester, or one year. While studying abroad through EAP, students can continue to make progress toward their UCI degree. See the Center for International Education section of the Catalogue or an academic counselor for additional information. REQUIREMENTS FOR THE BACHELOR'S DEGREE University Requirements: See pages 57-61. School Requirements: See page 190. Departmental Requirements for the Major Spanish 2C or Spanish 5 is a prerequisite to major requirements. Spanish lOA is a prerequisite to Spanish lOB. Spanish lOB is either a prerequisite or a corequisite for the Spanish lOOA-E series. Core: Spanish lOA-B; 110B, 110C in the bilingualism track must take 110C); Spanish 113A. In addition, the student must choose one or more of the following emphases: Literature and Culture: Six upper-division courses in literature, two of which may be in culture, film, and/or creative writing, plus two additional courses in the Spanish lOOA-E series (therefore, the entire lOOA-E series must be completed). NOTE: two courses in the Spanish lOOA-E series must be completed before enrolling in upper-division literature courses numbered above 100. Students may not enroll in more than two of the 100 series courses per quarter. Linguistics: Linguistics 3, Spanish 113B, plus any three courses selected from: Linguistics 154, 169, 170 and Spanish 187,201, 202, 205 (students are encouraged to take no more than one of the Spanish 200 series courses; if at all possible, this course should be taken in their senior year). In addition, students must take two additional upper-division Spanish linguistics or general linguistics courses (general linguistics courses are offered by the Department of Linguistics). Students may double major in Spanish and Lin\u00ad guistics but may not count the same course for both majors. Bilingualism: Spanish 15, 107, 113B, 142 (previously Spanish 134), 105 (previously lOOA), 106A or 106B (previously Spanish lOOB and 115, respectively), 114, and one additional upper-divi\u00ad sion Spanish literature course. Residence Requirement for the Major: At least five upper-divi\u00ad sion courses required for the major must be completed successfully at UCI. Departmental Requirements for the Spanish Minor Spanish 2C or 5 (or equivalent) is a prerequisite to minor requirements. Seven courses in Spanish, including Spanish lOA and lOB and at least four upper-division courses. Spanish and Portuguese 235 Residence Requirement for the Minor: At least four upper-divi\u00ad sion courses required for the minor must be completed successfully at UCI. Departmental Requirements for the Portuguese Minor Prerequisite: Portuguese lC or the equivalent. Requirements: Seven upper-division courses: Portuguese 140A-B, 141, 142, 143, 144, 145. (These are offered on a two-year cycle.) Residence Requirement for the Minor: At least four upper-divi\u00ad sion courses required for the minor must be completed successfully at UCI. CAREER OPPORTUNITIES Spanish is particularly useful in international business or trade, community or social service, and in foreign service. Spanish majors interested in writing may look to publishing, writing, or editing positions. Majoring in Spanish is excellent preparation for graduate and pro\u00ad fessional study in law, medicine, social welfare, library science, business or public administration, education, international relations, journalism, or advanced study in Spanish. An option available to Spanish majors is UCI's 3-2 Program offered by the Graduate School of Management, in which students may earn a Bachelor's degree in Spanish and a Master's degree in Management in five years rather than the usual six. The emphasis in bilingualism is very useful for many of the fields described above. The Career and Life Planning Center provides services to UCI stu\u00ad dents and alumni including career counseling, information about job opportunities, a career library, and workshops on resume preparation, job search, and interview techniques. See the Career and Life Planning Center section for additional information. Distinguished Visiting Professors The Department's Distinguished Visiting Professors program brings students in direct contact with some of the outstanding intellectuals in the field of Spanish, Latin American, and Chicano/United States Latino literatures and cultures. Distinguished visiting professors teach both graduate and undergraduate courses during winter and spring quarters and produce a publication for the Hispanic Studies Series published by Juan De La Cuesta. Program participants have included Professor Elias L. Rivers (1991) from the State University of New York at Stonybrook, one of the most important American scholars in Spanish Golden Age literature; Alfonso Sastre (1992), the most prestigious Spanish playwright and intellectual; Professor Heman Vidal (1993) from the University of Minnesota, a well\u00ad known theorist and scholar in Latin American literature and cul\u00ad ture; Professor John Kronik (1994) from Cornell University, a renowned scholar of modem Spanish literature; and Professor Jose Agustin (1995), a leading Mexican novelist and cultural critic. Graduate Program All graduate courses in the Department of Spanish and Portuguese are taught in Spanish, unless otherwise indicated in the course description. MASTER OF ARTS IN SPANISH The candidate is expected to have the equivalent of the UCI under\u00ad graduate major. The student takes a minimum of 11 courses, eight of which must be at the graduate level. Two of the 11 courses must be in linguistics. Spanish 239A, Methods of Literary Criticism, is required of all literature majors. A maximum of two courses may be transferred from another university, but a maximum of five may be accepted from another University of California campus. Profi\u00ad ciency (defined as the equivalent of the level attained at the end of UC IRVINE - 1996-1997I 236 UCI 1996-97 School of Humanities course 2C) in a foreign language other than the major language is required. The comprehensive examination, in part written, in part oral, will be based both on a reading list and the courses taken and will also test students ability to express themselves correctly in Spanish. No thesis is required. The student may choose an empha\u00ad sis in literature or linguistics. The M.A. requires a minimum of one year in academic residence and must be completed in no more than three years of graduate study. Normally only students who are studying for the Ph.D. are admitted to the graduate program. The comprehensive examination for the M.A. may be accepted as the written portion of the qualifying examination for the Ph.D. MASTER OF ARTS IN TEACHING IN SPANISH This program is specifically designed to meet the needs of working credentialed teachers, although others may apply. It seeks to pro\u00ad vide a group of modern, relevant courses that will enable teachers to keep abreast of recent developments in their field. Applicants should have a B.A. in Spanish and should acquire proficiency in a foreign language other than Spanish. The program consists of 10 courses (eight of which must be at the graduate level) as follows: three courses in Hispanic literature; three courses in Hispanic civi\u00ad lization; three courses in Hispanic linguistics; and one course in Recent Trends in Foreign Language Teaching, to be combined with a curricular research project or a thesis. M.A.T. students are coun\u00ad seled by a faculty member in the Department. DOCTOR OF PHILOSOPHY IN SPANISH The Department of Spanish and Portuguese offers a Ph.D. degree in Spanish with a specialization in Spanish literature, Spanish\u00ad American literature, or Chicano!Latino literature. The program attempts to integrate period and genre studies with work in literary theory, linguistics, and socio-historical studies. Students are advised to take a number of courses outside of the Department. The Depart\u00ad ment thereby hopes to aid in the formation of Ph.D. candidates who are not narrow specialists but rather scholars acquainted with the various fields that relate to their discipline. The Department is concerned also with the practical aspects of helping its graduates become good teachers. The minor field can be Spanish literature, Spanish\"American litera\u00ad ture, Chicano studies, Spanish linguistics, literary theory, compara\u00ad tive literature, or a non-Hispanic literature. A graduate emphasis in Feminist Studies also is available. Refer to the Women's Studies section of the Catalogue for information. Language Requirements A reading knowledge of Portuguese and two other languages rele\u00ad vant to the student's area of specialization is required. Advanced study in one of these languages may be offered in lieu of the read\u00ad ing knowledge of the other. The choice of languages requires Department approval. Course Requirements A minimum of 23 courses beyond the B.A. or 12 beyond the M.A. are required: two courses in linguistics, one diachronic and one synchronic; one course in Luso-Brazilian literature; two courses in literary theory (Spanish 239A and one other course from within or outside the Department). The remaining courses are distributed according to the student's needs and interests. These are determined in consultation with the students' guidance committee, which is comprised of three faculty members who are appointed to recommend the student's program. A minimum of 12 courses should be taken during the student's res\u00ad idence at UCI as a Ph.D. candidate, even if some of them have been taken in partial fulfillment of a M.A. degree elsewhere. Stu\u00ad dents are normally encouraged to take more than the minimum number of required courses. Teaching Since the overwhelming majority of Ph.D. candidates plan to teach, the Department recognizes its responsibility to train them as teach\u00ad ers. Therefore, all Ph.D. candidates without previous teaching ex\u00ad perience are required to teach one course under supervision in each of three quarters at UCI. Candidates are also required to assist in teaching an upper-division course related to their specialization. Comprehensive Examination The student is admitted to candidacy by passing, by a majority vote, an oral examination administered by a Candidacy Committee appointed by the Department, on behalf of the Dean of Graduate Studies and the Graduate Council. The Candidacy Committee is composed of five members, four of whom are from the Depart\u00ad ment. The oral examination will be preceded by a written examina\u00ad tion consisting of three parts: 1. A four-hour examination on the specialization, which includes questions of (a) a panoramic nature, either synchronic or dia\u00ad chronic, the choice being left to the student; (b) theory of the genre of choice; and (c) the specific emphasis selected by the student. 2. A three-hour examination on the minor field. 3. A three-hour examination on a topic that may cross generic or chronological lines. The student will propose the topic, which is subject to the approval of the guidance committee, and which cannot duplicate substantially any other parts of the examination. Dissertation A dissertation topic will be chosen by the candidate and will nor\u00ad mally fall within one of the major fields covered by the compre\u00ad hensive examination. Three faculty members appointed by the Department Chair, on behalf of the Dean of Graduate Studies and the Graduate Council, constitute the Doctoral Committee which supervises the prepara\u00ad tion and completion of the doctoral dissertation. The Doctoral Committee supervises a final examination, the focus of which is the content of the dissertation. Ordinarily, the final examination will not be given after the dissertation is completed, but rather at an appropriate point during its development. Such final examina\u00ad tion normally will be given while the graduate student is in resi\u00ad dence at UCI. The Doctoral Committee certifies that a completed dissertation is satisfactory through the signatures of the individual Committee members on the title page.

From the largest information processing problems to the control of the engines in our automobiles, these technologies play a vital role. This revolution is only a few decades old, but already futurists talk about the twenty-first century in terms of the \"infor\u00ad mation Department of Information and Computer Sci\u00ad ence (ICS) is in the center of this revolution, with programs of instruction and research in a variety of areas within computer and information technology. ICS faculty cover a broad spectrum of important topics in their research and teaching interests including: formal and mathematical methods for improving the performance and power of computa\u00ad tional systems; advanced processes for design and engineering of computer systems and communication networks; the software that Information and Computer Science 241 makes the computer useful, with particular concern for the design and engineering of large software systems for critical applications; the fascinating area of intelligence, and the connections between natural and artificial intelligence; the economics, sociology, and application of tht< technology in modem organizations, and the use of interactive multimedia in computer systems that facilitate learn\u00ad ing. The faculty are concerned with more than just technology, however. The fundamental intellectual features of the information and computer sciences are applicable to many scholarly and scien\u00ad tific fields. ICS is truly an interdisciplinary department, simultane\u00ad ously grounded in science and oriented toward application. Computer resources available for campuswide use include the Maspar and Hypercube parailel processors, which are made avail\u00ad able by various departments at UCI. Additionally, systems avail\u00ad able from the UCI Office of Acadeiil.ic Computing (OAC) include Convex C3840 (UNIX), DEC VAXstation (VMS), Sun SPARC servers, numerous workstations, and color scanners and printers. Campus dial-up lines provide support for home connections to many of these systems as well as systems within the Department of Information and Computer Science. X teriil.inals, Pentium PCs, and Power Macintoshes also are available via laboratories open 24 hours a day. Additional information may be obtained by calling OAC at (714) 824-6116 or by sending electronic mail to oac@uci.edu. Computer resources within the Department 9f Information and Computer Science include a wide range of instructional and research machines. For instructional computing, these include two UNIX servers (a Sun SPARCserver 1000 multiprocessor and a Sun 670MP multiprocessor), 50 SPARC workstations, 180 Macin\u00ad toshes, and some additional PCs and general purpose terminals. For research computing, resources include a Sequent multiproces\u00ad sor and over 250 varying types of Sun workstations and servers. DEGREES Information and Computer Science ....................... B.S., M.S., Ph.D. Honors Honors at magna cum laude, summa cum laude, are awarded to approximately 12 percent of the gradu\u00ad ating seniors. Students are nominated for honors based on criteria such as grade point average (including overall, ICS, mathematics); number of upper-division ICS courses completed beyond the mini\u00ad mum; courses taken outside ICS beyond required breadth; and research activities. To be eligible for honors, a general criterion is that students must have completed at least 72 units in residence at a University of California campus. Other important factors are con\u00ad sidered (see page 55). CAREERS FOR THE ICS MAJOR Many career opportunities exist for students with an undergraduate degree in computer science. Entry-level positions have included systems programmer, systems analyst, network administrator, man\u00ad agement information systems consultant, and software engineer. The Career and Life Planning Center provides services to UCI stu\u00ad dents and alumni including career counseling, information about job opportunities, and a career library, as well as workshops on resume preparation, job search, interview techniques, and intern\u00ad ship opportunities. Additional information is available in the Career and Life Planning Center section. Undergraduate Program The ICS undergraduate program prepares students for professions and careers in industry and provides students with the tools for advanced education at the graduate level. Many ICS graduates fol\u00ad low career paths immediately after graduation; others go on to advanced study in a variety of fields, including computer science, UC IRVINE - 1996-1997I 242 UCI 1996-97 Department of Information and Computer Science management, engineering, law, medicine, and so on. An ICS undergraduate education is a blend of scholarship, science, tech\u00ad nology, and practical application that forms an excellent foundation for professional life in the twenty-first century and prepares a stu\u00ad dent with serviceable skills useful for a lifetime. The basis of the ICS undergraduate program is a set of fundamen\u00ad tal courses in mathematics and computer science, supplemented by breadth requirements from other academic disciplines. A premium is placed on writing and quantitative skills. Students start early with hands-on experience with advanced computing systems, and intense use of computer and network technologies continues throughout the undergraduate program. ICS students study data organization, algorithm design and analysis, design and organiza\u00ad tion of hardware and network systems, software engineering, artifi\u00ad cial intelligence, social aspects of system design and use, and management of technology. In the process, students work with state-of-the-art hardware and software technologies, learn several contemporary programming languages, and make extensive use of computer-based utilities such as electronic mail. ICS students can send and receive electronic mail over the Internet, read and respond to Internet bulletin boards, and browse the World Wide Web. Students who are doing, or planning to do, extensive work with numerical problems are advised to consider courses in numerical analysis, statistics, probability, or other applied mathematics areas. Students may also wish to consult the list of courses offered by the School of Engineering. Students enrolled in other degree programs who are interested in digital computer programming and the field of computer science will normally begin their studies with Introduction to Computer Science I (ICS 21) and continue in the programming sequence with Introduction to Computer Science II and III (ICS 22 and 23) as far as their interests require and their programs permit. The ICS Undergraduate Student Affairs Office is staffed by profes\u00ad sional academic counselors and peer advisors. These individuals are available to assist students with program planning, questions on University and departmental policies and procedures, progress toward graduation, and other questions that arise in the course of a student's education. Faculty also are available for advising, gener\u00ad ally for suggestions of additional course work in the student's area of specialization and on preparation for graduate school. TRANSFER STUDENT POLICY Students who transfer to UCI are held to the following require\u00ad ments: 1. One year of college mathematics. Courses equivalent to Mathe\u00ad matics 6A-B-C are preferred as this facilitates scheduling after transfer to UCI. If not available, students should take first-year calculus. A semester of precalculus and a semester of calcuhis may not be used to satisfy this requirement. 2. Completion of one year of computer science courses. The year of computer science course work must contain one program\u00ad ming course involving concepts such as those found in Pascal, C, C++, Ada, or another modem, high-level language. Program\u00ad ming-only courses in BASIC, FORTRAN, and COBOL are not sufficient. Additional classes beyond the programming course must be taken to satisfy the year of computer science. It is strongly recommended that these courses be selected from classes that do not focus strictly on learning a programming lan\u00ad guage, such as courses in data structures or computer architec\u00ad ture, if such courses are available. 3. Completion of one course in approved lower-division writing. NOTE: The lower-division requirement in ICS consists of five courses which must be taken in a certain order and which are prerequisites for upper-division courses. Students who transfer to UCI as juniors and must complete all or part of this sequence will therefore find that it will take longer than two years to complete their degrees. To ensure admission consideration for the fall quarter, students should be sure to file their application by November 30 of the prior year. The selection criteria include grades, test scores, and other considerations. Note, however, that in cases where the number of incoming freshmen and advanced standing students who elect ICS as a major exceeds the number of positions available, not all appli\u00ad cants will be accommodated. Alternately, students can come to the campus without declaring a major and take the courses necessary to meet the ICS change-of\u00ad major requirements, Once the course work is completed, and the other conditions for changing majors met, students may then apply for a change of major to ICS. Additional information is available from the ICS academic counselors. REQUIREMENTS FOR THE BACHELOR'S DEGREE University Requirements: See pages 57-61.

Admission to the program is based on a formal application submitted to the Department in the spring. Applications are available each year beginning May 15 and must be submitted by June 15 to ensure consideration. For an application to be considered, the following conditions must be met (although exceptions may be granted in unusual circumstances): 1. The student must have completed the required lower-division ICS courses and Mathematics 6A-B-C by the end of the spring quarter in which the application is made. 2. The student must have the following grade point averages: a. an overall grade point average of at least 3.2; b. a grade point average of 3.5 or higher in the required lower\u00ad division ICS courses; c. a grade point average of 3.5 or higher in Mathematics 6A-B-C. 3. Application must be made in the spring of the student's sopho\u00ad more year. Certain exceptions are available, for example, for transfer students whose completion of the lower-division courses is delayed. In selecting students for the honors program, the Department also considers evidence of ability and interest in research. Students admitted to the program participate in the ICS Honors Seminar (ICS Hl97), which provides an introduction to research areas in the Department, followed by a minimum of two quarters of inde\u00ad pendent supervised work (ICS H198). Passing these two 198s counts for one of the project courses required for the major, provided that the other project course taken is in a different area. In order for the student to be considered to have successfully completed the honors program, the work must be certified to be of honors quality by the student's advisor and by the program advisor. THE 3-2 PROGRAM WITH THE GRADUATE SCHOOL OF MANAGEMENT Outstanding students who are interested in a career in management may wish to apply for entry into the Graduate School of Manage\u00ad ment's 3-2 Program.

UC IRVINE - 1996-1997I 244 UCI 1996-97 Department of Information and Computer Science CONCENTRATION IN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI) Artificial intelligence has as its twin goals the understanding of liv\u00ad ing intelligence and the creation of intelligent artifacts. Inherently interdisciplinary, work in the field draws heavily on solid results from the theory of computation, cognitive and behavioral psychol\u00ad ogy, and neuroscience. Topics range from \"bottom-up\" modeling of brain operation and its emergent function to high-level opera\u00ad tions such as problem-solving, learning, language understanding, and reasoning. The ICS artificial intelligence group maintains a balance between these two concerns, recognizing that each contributes to the other. Of particular importance to AI researchers in ICS are findings from psychology and neurobiology that suggest computational algo\u00ad rithms, and analyses of such algorithms that suggest explanations for capabilities and limitations of human cognition. The ICS artifi\u00ad cial intelligence group is also distinguished by its concern with machine learning-the mechanisms by which knowledge is acquired through experience. Required Courses The following courses must be passed with a grade of B or better: Seminar in Research in ICS (ICS 202); two courses of Special Topics in Information and Computer Science (ICS 280) taught by AI area faculty; three courses selected from: Introduction to Artifi\u00ad cial 270A), Networks (ICS or Neural Networks (ICS 276A); two additional courses from: Advanced Artificial Intelligence Programming (ICS 270B), Knowledge Rep\u00ad resentation in AI (ICS 271A), Qualitative Reasoning (ICS 271B), Problem Solving and Planning (ICS 272A), Natural Language (ICS 272B), Rea\u00ad soning/ Belief Networks (ICS 275B), Seminar in Models of the Brain (ICS 276B), Cognitive and Computational Neuroscience (ICS 276C); and five graduate courses outside of Artificial Intelli\u00ad gence, at least three of which must be within the ICS Department. Paper Requirement Each student must write two research papers of publishable quality. CONCENTRATION IN COMPUTER SYSTEMS DESIGN (CSD) New application areas are placing increasingly challenging demands on existing computer systems. At the same time, advanced tech\u00ad nologies are being developed that make the design and manufactur\u00ad ing of computer systems faster and cheaper. The current trend in computerization is toward application-targeted systems that solve specific problems well. The development of such systems requires an understanding of the complex interactions between applications, software, and hardware. The Computer Systems Design area addresses the various aspects of bridging the gap between the demands Of new applications and available technology. It is designed to produce computer scientists with an increased awareness of the demands imposed on computers by the application domains which have traditionally been viewed as extrinsic to computer science. This application sensitivity will give students a unique advantage in the increasingly important area of integrated software/hardware computer and information systems and will prepare them to meet the challenges of real-world problems. Required Courses Computer Systems Design is a broad concentration and is divided into two specializations: (1) Design Science, and (2) Parallel, Distributed, and Network Systems. The course requirements for Computer Systems Design have been selected to encourage students to take courses in either one of these two speciality areas. The following courses must be passed with a grade of B or better: Seminar in Research in ICS (ICS 202); at least three quarters of either Seminar in Parallel Distributed and Network Systems (ICS 249) or Seminar in Design Science (ICS 259); five graduate courses outside of Computer Systems Design but within ICS, no more than three of which may be in one area; and five core courses selected from the following (four from the student's area of specialization and one from the other area): Design Science: Computer Systems Architecture (ICS 241), Digital System Verification and Testing (ICS 251), Introduction to Com\u00ad puter Design (ICS 252), Design Description and Modeling (ICS 253), VLSI System Design (ICS 254), Physical Design Automation (ICS 255), Design Synthesis (ICS 256), System Tools (ICS 257). Parallel, Distributed, and Network Systems: Computer Systems Architecture (ICS 241), Parallel Computer Architectures and Lan\u00ad guages (ICS 242), Computer Networks (ICS 243), Parallel Com\u00ad puting (ICS 244), High-Performance Architectures and Their Com\u00ad pilers (ICS 245), Computer Systems Modeling and Performance Evaluation (ICS 246), Distributed Computer Systems (ICS 247). Paper Requirement Each student must write two research papers of publishable quality. CONCENTRATION IN COMPUTING, ORGANIZATIONS, POLICY, AND SOCIETY (CORPS) UCI is an internationally recognized center for research on the social and managerial dimensions of computerization. One stream of this research examines the impacts and policy issues that sur\u00ad round computerization. A second stream, which is longitudinal and organizational in emphasis, examines the ways in which users develop computing technologies, including workplace negotiations and coalitions. CORPS researchers study these topics in various public and private settings including government agencies, large and small commercial enterprises, and universities. CORPS has recently added research focusing on computer-sup\u00ad ported cooperative work and human-computer interaction. Exam\u00ad ples of specific interests are social and behavioral factors affecting the design and adoption of groupware, and technical support for organizational learning and memory. Work in these areas consists of both empirical research and the building of prototype systems. Other projects focus on information technologies such as digital libraries and decision support systems. CORPS researchers focus on understanding the \"reality\" of computerization, in contrast with utopian promises and anti-utopian fears. A large fraction of the research is empirical, and is conducted in vivo-in organizations or other social settings where computer-based systems are developed and used routinely. The empirical studies of work organization and organizational control patterns also have an important theoretical dimension. Other theoretical studies conducted by CORPS researchers build upon a broad body of empirical studies of the social dimensions of information technologies. Required Courses The following courses must be passed with a grade of B or better: Seminar in Research in ICS (ICS 202); Social Analysis of Comput\u00ad ing (ICS 230); at least three quarters of Seminar in Research on Social Analysis and Information Systems (ICS 239); four courses chosen from: Computer Supported Cooperative Work (ICS 233), Computerization, Work, and Organizations (ICS 234A), Theories of Computerization and Information Systems (ICS 234B), Qualita\u00ad tive Research Methods in Information Systems (ICS 235A), Quan\u00ad titative Research Methods in Information Systems (ICS 235B); and five or six graduate courses outside of CORPS, only one of which may be ICS 280. The five or six courses are chosen as follows. A student who does not elect to take an optional minor outside of ICS must take five UC IRVINE - 1996-1997graduate courses within ICS in at least two areas other than CORPS. A student who elects to take a minor outside of ICS must take three graduate courses within ICS in at least two areas other than CORPS, in addition to three graduate courses outside of ICS. The minor outside of ICS consists of three graduate courses which form a coherent area of study. Paper Requirement Each student must write a survey paper and a research paper of publishable quality. CONCENTRATION IN SOFTWARE The ICS software faculty is engaged in fundamental studies, devel\u00ad opment, integration, and empirical evaluation of technologies in four key subareas of software and software engineering research: modeling and analysis; environments; advanced methods and tools; and evaluation. The modeling and analysis of software systems has been in exis\u00ad tence the longest and is a traditional part of software development Concerns of correctness and performance are considered here, as well as tasks such as debugging. Software development environments can promote efficient applica\u00ad tion of tools, provide uniform user interfaces, manage the multi\u00ad tude of objects created during the life of a software system, and be proactive in supporting development and maintenance activities. The challenge here is in creating extensible environment architec\u00ad tures which incorporate the best features from early environments, satisfy the demands of new tools, and integrate analysis, design, and management methods. The emphasis on advanced methods and tools includes work on novel software development processes and their representation and advanced tools that automate significant portions of processes. The emphasis of the evaluation research area is to study, develop, and apply methods for characterizing and evaluating the effect of software technologies on the software development process, the delivered software product, and the soft\u00ad ware developers. Controlled empirical studies play a central role in the assessment of software technologies and in the advancement of theories of software development. Background: Students must have basic competency in the follow\u00ad ing computer science topics: programming language concepts, data structures, analysis of algorithms, automata theory or formallan-. guages, artificial intelligence, computer architecture, and operating systems. The software faculty will evaluate, upon entry to the Ph.D. program, whether a student has satisfied these requirements through courses taken previously (e.g., at the undergraduate level) or through equivalent experience. Satisfaction of any unfulfilled requirements may be achieved through either graduate or under\u00ad graduate classes in an individualized program worked out with a software area graduate advisor. Required Courses The following courses must be passed with a grade of B or better: Seminar in Research in ICS (ICS 202); Software Engineering (ICS 221A); Formal Methods in Software Engineering (ICS 222); at least three quarters of Seminar in Software (ICS 229); two courses from: Software Analysis and Testing (ICS 224A), Software Processes (ICS 225), Software Measurement (ICS 226), Software Environments (ICS 228); two other courses from the Software area (ICS 220 -228, including ICS 280s taught by Software area fac\u00ad ulty); and four graduate courses outside of Software, including Fundamentals of Scientific Research (ICS 201) and Models of Computing (ICS 203), drawn from a list maintained by the faculty. Paper Requirement Each student must write a survey paper with an extensive bibliog\u00ad raphy and a research paper of publishable quality. Information and Computer Science 245 CONCENTRATION IN ALGORITHMS AND DATA STRUCTURES (THEORY) The goal of research in theoretical computer science is to produce results, supported by rigorous proof, about problems dealing with computers and their applications. The questions to be investigated are often motivated by practical problems, but the goal of under\u00ad standing the underlying combinatorial properties of the problem is often as important as producing a solution of immediate applicabil\u00ad ity. The actual problems to be solved are often very complicated, so researchers seek some abstraction that can be rigorously studied. In particular, they often seek to investigate the fundamental combi\u00ad natorial structure of a problem abstracted away from the original physical setting. For example, the problem of placing a set of files onto as few floppy disks as possible without exceeding their stor\u00ad age capacity is fundamentally the same as the problem of loading a set of items onto as few trucks as possible without exceeding their weight limit. Many problems, from a variety of application areas, fall into the category of efficient algorithm design. A key property of work in this area is its emphasis on the amount of resources required by a given algorithm; this is called the com\u00ad plexity of the algorithm. The resource most commonly considered is time, but other resources often considered are the amount of memory required and, in the case of parallel computation, the num\u00ad ber of processors required. For many problems, an efficient solu\u00ad tion has been obtained only after deep insights into the nature of the problem. For many problems, the efficiency of the best solution possible remains unknown. Research in algorithms and data structures grapples with such questions. It is a young science with an inherently interdisciplinary flavor. Problems to be investigated have come from a variety of sources, such as VLSI design, image processing, genetics, trans\u00ad portation, and artificial intelligence. Solution methods are brought to bear from areas such as discrete applied mathematics, probabil\u00ad ity theory, and a rich body of insights developed within theoretical computer science. The goal of the research, as in mathematics, is to produce results supported by rigorous proof; the emphasis on complexity gives this area its unique flavor. Results that first might appear to be only of theoretical value are sometimes of profound relevance to practical problems. Required Courses The following courses must be passed with a grade of B or better: Seminar in Research in ICS (ICS 202); Data Structures (ICS 261); Automata Theory (ICS 262); Analysis of Algorithms (ICS 263); two courses from: Advanced Analysis of Algorithms (ICS 264), Graph Algorithms (ICS 265), Computational Geometry (ICS 266), Special Topics in ICS (ICS 280) taught by Theory faculty; and five graduate courses outside of Theory, at least three of which must be within ICS; if the student has an optional minor, at least two of these courses must be outside the minor.

Weinberger, Ph.D. Case Western Reserve University, Professor of Biological Sciences Peter Woodruff, Ph.D. University of Pittsburgh, Associate Professor of Philosophy The minor in the History and Philosophy of Science is intended for students who wish to study the history of science, the philosophical foundations of scientific inquiry, and the relationship between Latin American Studies 253 science and other fields. The history of science explores how sci\u00ad ence is actually done and how it has influenced history. This may involve tracking down an idea's source or its influences, evaluating the cultural forces at work in the generation of a scientific theory or the reaction of culture to science, or taking a detailed look at the work of a particular scientist or movement within science. The philosophy of science is concerned with determining what sci\u00ad ence and mathematics are, accounting for their apparent successes, and resolving problems of philosophical interest that arise in the sciences. Philosophy of science courses cover such topics as the role of logic and language in science and in mathematics, scientific explanation, evidence, and probability. These courses may also cover work that has been done on the philosophical problems in specific sciences-for example, the direction of time in physics, the model of mind in psychology, the structure of evolution theory in biology, and the implications of GOdel's incompleteness theorems for mathematics. The minor is available to all UCI students. Course descriptions may be found in the academic unit sections of the Catalogue.

Whalen, Ph.D. University of California, Los Angeles, Department Chair of Psychology and Social Behavior and Professor of Social Ecology and Psychiatry and Human Behavior Women's Studies, like feminism, is a way of asking questions rather than a particular set of answers or conclusions. How does being female affect one's participation in family, literature, history, art, politics, economy, and education? How do language, visual representations, beliefs, and valuj!s shape women's and men's status in society and culture? How does the experience of women differ by race, class, nationality, religion, and sexual preference? The new knowledge and perspectives provoked by such questions have established Women's Studies as a dynamic and compelling field of study and have spurred the restructuring of curriculum and knowl\u00ad edge across the other disciplines. The field of women's studies has developed at a phenomenal rate from a handful of student-initiated courses in the early 1970s to more than 500 programs in colleges and universities across the United States offering degrees at the B.A., M.A., and Ph.D. levels. The Program in Women's Studies at UCI was founded in 1975 and has grown significantly since that time. The program offers a major leading to the B.A. degree in Women's Studies, an under\u00ad graduate minor, and a graduate emphasis in Feminist Studies. The undergraduate program in Women's Studies draws upon fac\u00ad ulty with expertise in humanities, social sciences, and the arts. Through diverse course offerings, the program examines the con\u00ad tributions of women from different backgrounds to culture and society and to explore women's and men's lives in the context of changing gender relations. The program emphasizes interdiscipli\u00ad nary, multicultural scholarship and includes course work in femi\u00ad nist theories, the cultural roles of women, women's socioeconomic condition, women's history, women's literature in a cross-cultural frame, women's images in fine arts and film, women of color, and lesbian and gay studies. Women's Studies provides a unique intellectual community where faculty and students share a commitment to interactive teaching and learning. Students work closely with faculty and the program's academic coordinator to plan a coherent program of study and to anticipate work toward advanced degrees and a wide variety of career options. CAREER OPPORTUNITIES A degree in Women's Studies prepares students for the expanding opportunities available in graduate programs and in numerous careers in both the public and private sectors. As more women work, business and corporations find the need for increased knowl\u00ad edge about women, and the growth of women's organizations and agencies-at the local, national, and global levels-is creating new opportunities for graduates with specializations in Women's Stud\u00ad ies. Graduates bring unique skills and knowledge to the professions of law, medicine, social work, teaching, counseling, and to govern\u00ad ment service, all of which increasingly require expertise on issues concerning women and gender. A background in Women's Studies develops critical and analytical skills which prove valuable in the full range of life choices. The Career and Life Planning Center provides services to UCI stu\u00ad dents and alumni including career counseling, information about job opportunities, a career library, and workshops on resume preparation, job search, and interview techniques. In addition, the Women's Studies Office provides more specialized career counsel\u00ad ing and information on graduate programs in Women's Studies and related fields.

GRADUATE EMPHASIS IN FEMINIST STUDIES The Program in Women's Studies offers an emphasis in Feminist Studies, which is available in conjunction with the Ph.D. programs in the Departments of Anthropology, Art History, East Asian Lan\u00ad guages and Literatures, English and Comparative Literature, French and Italian, German, History, Sociology, and Spanish and Portuguese; with the Ph.D. concentration in Social Relations; and with the M.F.A. programs in the Departments of Drama and Studio Art. Satisfactory completion of the emphasis is certified by the Director of Women's Studies and is noted in the student's dossier. Admission to the Program Applicants must first be admitted to, or currently enrolled in, one of the participating programs noted above. Applicants must submit to the Women's Studies Graduate Program Committee: (1) an application form listing prior undergraduate and graduate course work related to Feminist Studies, institutions attended, and majors(s); (2) a one-to two-page statement of purpose, including career objectives, areas of interest and research, record of research, teaching, community and/or creative work; and (3) a sample of written work related to Feminist Studies. The Committee determines admissions, in consultation with the Women's Studies Core Faculty, based upon the extent to which the applicant's research interests relate to Feminist Studies, the appli\u00ad cant's previous course work, and research or other experience related to Feminist or Women's Studies. Lack of prior course work does not preclude admission, so long as a compelling statement of research interests congruent with the graduate emphasis makes the case. Emphasis Requirements Minimum course work for the graduate emphasis in Feminist Stud\u00ad ies consists of four courses: two core courses, Women's Studies 200A-B, a coherent sequence normally taken in consecutive quar\u00ad ters; and any two courses selected from the list of courses in Femi\u00ad nist Studies approved by the Committee, as long as one of these is a graduate course in the student's own department or area of inter\u00ad est. In keeping with the interdisciplinary focus of this emphasis, it is highly recommended that the other be a course from a discipline outside that department or area. The course requirements for Ph.D. and M.F.A. candidates are the same. For doctoral students, the qualifying examination and dissertation topic should incorporate gender as a central category of analysis. One member of the candidate's qualifying examination committee Women's Studies 257 and of the candidate's dissertation committee is normally a mem\u00ad ber of the Women's Studies Core Faculty. There are no require\u00ad ments concerning qualifying examinations or theses for M.F.A. students.

UC IRVINE - 1996-1997ADDITIONAL OPPORTUNITIES FOR INTERDISCIPLINARY STUDY Minor in Global Sustainability 321 Steinhaus Hall; (714) 824-6006; Fax (714) 824-2181 Peter J. Bryant A. Bowler, Co-directors Core Faculty Peter A.

Reeburgh, Ph.D. The Johns Hopkins University, Professor of Earth System Science Susan E. Trumbore, Ph.D. Columbia University, Assistant Professor of Earth System Science The interdisciplinary minor in Global Sustainability trains students to understand the changes that need to be made in order for the human population to live in a sustainable relationship with the resources available on this planet. As a result of population growth and the pursuit of higher standards of living, humanity has initiated many global trends that cannot be sustained indefinitely. Some of these trends are physicochemical in nature, such as the rapid deple\u00ad tion of fossil fuels and the increasing pollution of our environment, including the accumulation of ozone-depleting chemicals with con\u00ad sequent increase of ultraviolet radiation at the earth's surface, and the buildup of carbon dioxide that is almost certainly causing global warming. Other trends are biological ones including the degradation of agri\u00ad culturalland, the destruction of many kinds of wildlife habitat with associated high rates of species extinction, and the depletion of wildlife populations by over-exploitation. Global changes are also taking place in the human situation including loss of cultural diver\u00ad sity, a growing income gap between rich and poor nations leading to deepening poverty and additional pressure for biological resource exploitation, accelerating urbanization with associated social problems, and regional population and economic imbalances leading to escalating political tensions and potential for conflict. This program examines the causes of, and interrelationships between, these problems and considers new approaches to solving them. Its goal is to provide broad, interdisciplinary training that will allow students to better understand and effectively deal with the serious environmental problems that we will face in the twenty-first century. The minor is open to all UCI students. Course descriptions are available in the academic unit sections of the Catalogue.

The undergraduate minor is designed for those who wish to gain some insight into issues of modem man\u00ad agement, as well as those who anticipate future graduate work in Management. The Master's degree is professional in nature and is intended to provide future managers with a firm foundation in the basic disciplines and in management tools and techniques; the Ph.D. in Administration is for those who wish to pursue a career in scholarly research. Educational Objectives Three basic premises underlie the School's philosophy of graduate education. First, there are significant phenomena and problems common to business, educational, and governmental organizations; second, a common set of disciplines, concepts, techniques, and technologies exist which are appropriate to a wide range of organi\u00ad zational or scholarly roles; third, many administrators in the future will work in more than one of the three arenas during their careers. Regardless of the content of particular courses, it is expected that all degree candidates will be exposed to and have the ability to use the following: General Knowledge. The broad context of organizations and man\u00ad agement; the late twentieth and the early twenty-first century (sig\u00ad nificant trends, conditions, and problems); history of science, sci-entific inquiry, and the philosophy of science; economic, political, and social analysis. A Global Perspective. An in-depth knowledge of how to manage companies in the global environment of the future, how business is done in the major economic centers throughout the world, and ways in which cultural and historical factors influence business transactions. Conceptual and Empirical Knowledge of Organizations. Basic concepts of management; the structure and functions of organiza\u00ad tions, including comparative analysis and interorganizational rela\u00ad tions; levels and units of decision making; individual behavior and group norms; operating environments of organizations. Specific Knowledge of Particular Arenas of Administration. In\u00ad depth study of specific institutional environments for administra\u00ad tive practice, such as governmental and business organizations, and other types of organizations. Mathematics and Statistics. As tools of precise reasoning, as lan\u00ad guages which will tend more and more to dominate professional and scholarly literature, and above all, as foundations for relevant quantitative methods. Technical Bases of Management. Decision processes; operations research; systems and policy analysis; budgeting and accounting techniques; human resources policies; techniques for measuring and affecting attitudes and behavior; research design and strategies. Information Technology. How technology affects organizations and markets, and how to use information to create new strategic options and gain a lasting competitive advantage. General Skills. Political skills, effective management of interper\u00ad sonal relations, leadership strategies and tactics, and competence in oral, graphic, and written expression. Professional Orientations. Identification of factors, values, and policies which might bear on successful, responsible, and intellec\u00ad tually honest performance of organizational roles. Recognition of the administrator's potential contributions to society and of ethical and moral problems which arise from social research and the man\u00ad agement of human enterprises. General Admission Requirements Evaluation of the applicant's file for admission to the Master's and Ph.D. degree programs will consist of an integrated assessment of all materials (test scores, transcripts of previous academic work, statement of purpose, and letters of recommendation). The Univer\u00ad sity admission standard of a 3.0 or better undergraduate grade point average (on a 4.0 scale) is required. The minimum TOEFL (Test of English as a Foreign Language) score acceptable for study at GSM is 570. Requests for application material should be addressed to the Grad\u00ad uate School of Management, Admissions Office, University of Cal\u00ad Irvine, CA 92697-3125; e-mail: gsm-mba@uci.edu; World Wide Web: UC IRVINE - 1996-1997Doctor of Philosophy in Administration GSM admits students for the Ph.D. in the fall quarter only. The deadline for application is February 1: The Ph.D. program requires a commitment to full-time study. In addition to the other require\u00ad ments, Ph.D. applicants are encouraged to submit a previously pre\u00ad pared paper (research report, Master's thesis, essay, case study) which may be indicative generally of the applicant's interests and capabilities. GSM offers the Ph.D. in Administration to students with back\u00ad grounds in a variety of disciplines. While a master's degree is pre\u00ad ferred, students rhay be admitted to the doctoral program directly from the baccalaureate degree. There are many appropriate under\u00ad graduate majors, including (but not limited to) psychology, politi\u00ad cal science, business or public administration, mathematics, com\u00ad puter sciences, economics, sociology, and so forth. Students with academic strengths in disciplines not usually considered as precur\u00ad sors for management (e.g., natural sciences, humanities, and the arts) are encouraged to apply. The Ph.D. program is designed to prepare students for academic careers in a number of the fields of management, e.g., organizational behavior, operations and decision technologies, management information systems, finance, account\u00ad ing, marketing, and strategy/policy. Requirements of the Ph.D. pro\u00ad gram include a broad knowledge of core management disciplines. In addition, the Ph.D. student must qualify as a skilled researcher and must complete a dissertation demonstrating these skills. There are no foreign language requirements in the GSM Ph.D. program. The Ph.D. program is divided into two phases: qualification and dissertation. In the qualification phase the student prepares for dis\u00ad sertation research in an area of specialization. This phase is com\u00ad pleted when an oral qualifying examination is passed and the can\u00ad didacy committee recommends advancement to candidacy for the Ph.D. The dissertation phase involves a significant original research project which demonstrates the Ph.D. student's creativity and ability to launch and sustain a career of research. Students are expected to complete the Ph.D. in four to five years. Master's Degree Programs GSM offers a variety of programs leading to the M.B.A. (Master of Business Administration) degree. These include a two-year, full\u00ad time M.B.A. program; a 21-month Executive M.B.A. program; a two-year Health Care Executive M.B.A. program; and a three-year Fully Employed M.B.A. program. M.B.A. PROGRAM GSM admits students to the two-year, full-time M.B.A. Program in the fall quarter. Students from a variety of undergraduate disci\u00ad plines, including liberal arts, social sciences, physical or biological sciences, computer science, and engineering, are encouraged to apply. The deadline for completion of all phases of the application procedure is April 1. In addition to the general University rules governing admission to graduate study, GSM normally requires the following: 1. Completion of the Graduate Management Admission Test (GMAT). 2. Completion of a course in both introductory calculus and statis\u00ad tics with probability with a grade of B or better. Undergraduate courses in the social sciences (e.g., economics, psychology, sociology), information and computer sciences, and accounting are strongly recommended. Students also are encouraged to un\u00ad dertake intensive course work in the culture, history, geography, economy, politics, and language of specific foreign countries. Management 265 The evaluation of an applicant's file for admission consists of an integrated assessment of all materials submitted including test scores, transcripts of previous academic work, statements on appli\u00ad cation forms, and letters of recommendation. Above and beyond these factors, substantive work experience is given serious consid\u00ad eration in. the evaluation process. . The full-time M.B.A. program requires a minimum of23 quarter courses (92 units) with a minimum grade point average of 3.0 in the Core and overall. The curriculum consists of courses divided into two groups designed to. achieve specific educational objec\u00ad tives. The courses are divided as follows: 12 required Common Core Courses and 11 elective courses which students select to emphasize career goals and educational interests. A thesis is not required. Required Course Work. Common Core Courses, each of which is four units, are: Management of Complex Organizations, Statistics for Management, Management Science or Operations Manage\u00ad ment, Organizational Analysis for Management, Financial and Man\u00ad agerial Accounting for Management, Microeconomics, Macroeco\u00ad nomics for Management or Government and Public Policy, Information Technology for Management, Marketing for Manage\u00ad ment, Managerial Finance, Business Strategy. International Requirement. Students must fulfill the international requirement in one of the following ways; completion of a GSM international elective in a functional area; participation in a GSM international exchange program; or completion of an upper-divi\u00ad sion or graduate international course offered by a University of California school, with the approval of the GSM Associate Dean. Electives. Eleven electives are required. The major emphasis in the elective courses is to develop additional depth in a discipline or interdisciplinary area or specialized competence in the use of a par\u00ad ticular set of technical tools and methods. Students select their elec\u00ad tives in light of their educational and career goals and interests. The 3-2 Program for Undergraduates In addition to the full-time Master's program for students who have already received a bachelor's degree, outstanding UCI under\u00ad graduate students may apply to enter a cooperative 3-2 Program with GSM and most other campus units. Acceptance into the 3-2 Program constitutes advanced admission to the graduate program. Such students complete their undergraduate major requirements by the end of their junior year. During their senior year, they take graduate courses in GSM. These courses are used to satisfy their undergraduate unit requirements, and at the same time apply toward their graduate degree. Successful completion of the require\u00ad ments in the program normally leads to the bachelor's degree in the cooperating discipline after the fourth year, and the M.B.A. degree after the fifth year. Students should consult with their acad\u00ad emic counselor in their major School for further information about completing undergraduate requirements in three years. Students contemplating entering such a program should contact the Gradu\u00ad ate School of Management prior to, or early in, the start of their junior year for the purpose of program consultation. NOTE: With the exception of 3-2 students, no undergraduates will be enrolled in GSM graduate-level courses. Special Opportunities Within the M.B.A. program, GSM has created the Professional Track in Information Technology (IT), an intensive curriculum that provides students with sophisticated, state-of-the-art knowledge and practical experience in this rapidly evolving arena. Students admitted into the Professional Track in IT form a separate cohort who take the customary M.B.A. core courses, augmented by a set of IT applications courses in the functional areas. In addition, many of the electives are specialized courses that reflect the chang\u00ad ing nature of organizational management. Representative electives UC IRVINE - 1996-1997I 266 UCI 1996-97 Graduate School of Management are: Electronic Commerce, Information Technology and Organiza\u00ad tional Forms for the Twenty-First Century, Information Technology and Financial/Capital Markets, Information Technology and Man\u00ad agerial Decision Making, Financial Decision Support and Expert Systems, Information Technology and the Consumer, Marketing Research, and Forecasting. Additional activities designed to sup\u00ad plement this innovative curriculum include seminars given by industry leaders and relevant internships. Admission into the Professional Track in IT is competitive and a limited number of spaces are available. In addition to the standard admissions criteria, the Admissions Committee is particularly interested in how prospective candidates envision the current role and future potential of information technology in business. The Graduate School of Management offers course work in Health Care Management within the M.B.A. program. The courses pro\u00ad vide training not only in health care and related issues, but also expose students to professionals in the areas of management, finance, marketing, and strategic planning. Skills in these areas are critical to the success of health care organizations in the late 1990s and beyond. In today's interconnected global business world, it has become increasingly important for management students to learn to operate in an international environment. At GSM, M.B.A. students in the full-time program can gain first-hand knowledge of the culture and management practices of other industrialized countries by partici\u00ad pating in an academic exchange with universities located abroad. This experience, combined with GSM course work in international management, prepares students for the demands and complexities of the growing global economic environment. Currently, GSM has exchange relationships with the ESSEC Graduate agement, Belgium; of Economic Sciences (BUES), Budapest, Hungary; Vienna Uni\u00ad versity of Economics and Business Administration, Vienna, Aus\u00ad tria; ITESM (The Monterrey Institute of Technology and Higher Education), Monterrey, Mexico; Bocconi University, Milan, Italy; Swedish School of Economics and Business Administration, Helsinki, Finland; and Hong Kong University of Science and Tech\u00ad nology, Kowloon, Hong Kong. To complement the academic curriculum, a Management Internship Program provides practical application and work experience to selected GSM Master's students. Student interns are employed in administrative positions by local organizations. Course credit is available for participants in the Internship Program through the Management Practicum course. GSM faculty and organizational representatives, as well as student interns, participate in this semi\u00ad nar which deals with specific topics and projects encountered by the interns in their positions. Opportunities for students to take part in ongoing research exist through two Universitywide research units based on the Irvine campus. Through the Center for Research on Information Technol\u00ad ogy and Organizations (CRITO), a student may participate in research on significant public policy issues. CRITO projects are multidisciplinary by nature. The unit offers a unique opportunity for students to interact with scholars from allied disciplines such as social science, information and computer science, and social ecol\u00ad ogy. The Institute of Transportation Studies (ITS) conducts research in the areas of urban transportation policy and planning, transit management and labor relations, and transportation system evaluation. Qualified GSM students may participate in ITS projects as research assistants. M.B.A. Career Services The M.B.A. Career Services Office, located within the School, was established to serve the unique placement needs of M.B.A. stu\u00ad dents and alumni. It has two main functions: (1) attracting a vari\u00ad ety of organizations to interview and hire graduates and (2) coun\u00ad seling students in career opportunities and the techniques necessary to conduct effective job searches, not only for their first jobs but throughout their careers. The relatively small size of the M.B.A. program allows considerable interaction between the Career Ser\u00ad vices Office and students.

UC IRVINE - 1996-1997SCHOOL OF PHYSICAL SCIENCES Ralph J. Cicerone, Dean 180 Physical Sciences I Academic Counseling: (714) 824-6507 World Wide Web: http://www.physsci.uci.edu/ The School of Physical Sciences offers both professional training and general education in the Departments of Chemistry, Earth Sys\u00ad tem Science, Mathematics, and Physics and Astronomy. The fac\u00ad ulty, active in research and graduate education, are at the same time vitally concerned with undergraduate teaching. Curricula of the School are designed to meet the needs of a wide variety of stu\u00ad dents ranging from those with little technical background who seek insight into the activities and accomplishments of physical scien\u00ad tists to those seeking a comprehensive understanding that will pre\u00ad pare them for creative research in physical science. Over the course of the past century and a half, physics, chemistry, and mathematics have evolved into interdependent but separate intellectual disciplines. This development is reflected in the depart\u00ad mental structure of the School of Physical Sciences. In the same period, these fundamental disciplines have moved into domains of abstraction unimagined by early scientists. This trend to abstraction with its concomitant increase in understanding of the physical uni\u00ad verse provides the major challenge to the student of the physical sciences. Mathematics, physics, and chemistry, while providing the foundation of the technology that dominates contemporary civiliza\u00ad tion, underlie to an ever-increasing extent the new developments in the biological and social sciences. Earth system science is grounded in the traditional physical sciences while breaking new paths in the quantitative study of changes in the global environ\u00ad ment. In recognition of the contribution students can make to the acade\u00ad mic affairs of the School, a variety of responsibilities on School and departmental committees is given to undergraduate and gradu\u00ad ate students. DEGREES Chemistry ............................................................... B.S._, Honors Criteria used by the School of Physical Sciences in selecting candi\u00ad dates for honors at graduation are as follows: Approximately I per\u00ad cent will be awarded summa cum laude, 3 percent magna cum laude, and 8 percent cum laude. Honors are awarded on the basis of a student's performance in research, cumulative grade point average, and performance in upper-division courses in the major. A general criterion is that students must have completed at least 72 units in residence at a University of California campus. Other impor\u00ad tant factors are considered (see page 55). The School of Physical Sciences also grants special honors to students who have distin\u00ad guished themselves by their work in their major subject. Undergraduate Programs Each department offers courses that are of value to nonmajors and majors in the sciences. The programs for majors are designed to meet the needs of students planning careers in business or industry, of students planning advanced professional study, and of students planning graduate work that continues their major interest. Intro\u00ad ductory courses in chemistry, mathematics, and physics meet the needs of students majoring in the sciences, mathematics, and engineering and are also appropriate for students in other disci\u00ad plines who seek a rigorous introduction to the physical sciences. In addition, a number of courses within the School have few or no prerequisites and are directed particularly toward students majoring in areas remote from the sciences. PLANNING A PROGRAM OF STUDY Students who choose a major in the School of Physical Sciences have a variety of academic advising and counseling resources available to them. In addition to faculty advisors, there is a Chief Academic Advisor in each department who is responsible for inter\u00ad preting degree requirements, reviewing student petitions, and assisting with special advising problems. An academic advising and counseling staff, employed in the Associate Dean's Office, is available to serve a broad range of student advising needs. In con\u00ad sultation with their faculty advisor or an academic counselor, stu\u00ad dents should plan a course of study leading to a major in one of the departments of the School. In carrying out this major, students may often concentrate very heavily in a second department within the School or in some other school. Occasionally students choose to pursue a double major. Permission to do so may be sought by a petition submitted to the Office of the Associate Dean of Physical Sciences. All initial courses of study for majors include mathematics through calculus, and calculus is a prerequisite for much of the upper-divi\u00ad sion workin each major. A student interested in any of the physical sciences should continue mathematical training beyond these pre\u00ad requisite courses. Furthermore, students interested in either physics or chemistry usually will include work in both of these subjects in their undergraduate careers. Students in the physical sciences are urged to acquire a working knowledge of computer programming at an early stage of their . University studies. This can be accomplished by taking Informa\u00ad tion and Computer Science 21, Engineering ElO, Engineering ECEll, or Physics 9. CAREER OPPORTUNITIES The majority of graduates continue their education beyond the Bachelor's degree level. Many pursue advanced academic degrees in preparation for careers in scientific or medical research, engi\u00ad neering, or postsecondary education. Some students enter profes\u00ad sional school in areas such as medicine, dentistry, law, or business administration. Students who choose not to continue their studies beyond the baccalaureate level most frequently find employment in private business or industry. In addition to technical areas directly related to their major fields of study, students often enter careers in less obviously related fields such as computing, systems analysis, engineering, journalism, marketing, or sales. The Career and Life Planning Center provides services to UCI stu\u00ad dents and alumni including career counseling, information about job opportunities, a career library, and workshops on resume preparation, job search, and interview techniques. See the Career and Life Planning Center section for additional information. SPECIAL PROGRAMS Education Abroad Program Upper-division students have the opportunity to experience a dif\u00ad ferent culture while making progress toward degree objectives through the Education Abroad Program (EAP). EAP is an overseas study program which operates in cooperation with host universities UC IRVINE - 1996-1997I 274 UCI 1996-97 School of Physical Sciences and colleges throughout the world. See the Center for International Education section for additional information. 3-2 Program Chemistry, Physics, or Mathematics majors who are interested in a career in management may wish to apply for entry into the Gradu\u00ad ate School of Management's 3-2 Program. Students normally apply for this program early in their junior year. See the Graduate School of Management section for further information. Interdisciplinary Minors These interdisciplinary minors are available to all UCI undergradu\u00ad ates. A brief description follows; detailed information is included in the Interdisciplinary Studies section of the Catalogue. The minor in Global Peace and Conflict Studies is an interdisci\u00ad plinary curriculum which addresses the problem of international violence; the threat of global war; and paths to world-wide cooper\u00ad ation in building a secure, prosperous, and democratic future. The minor in Global Sustainability trains students to understand the changes that need to be made in order for the human popula\u00ad tion to live in a sustainable relationship with the resources avail\u00ad able on this planet. REQUIREMENTS FOR THE BACHELOR'S DEGREE University Requirements: See pages 57-61. School Requirements: None. Departmental Requirements: Refer to individual departments.

The curriculum of the Department is designed to sat\u00ad isfy the diverse needs of these students and others who may have occasion to study chemistry. The year course Chemistry lA-B-C is prerequisite to all study in the Department at more advanced levels. The subject matter of this course serves also as a thorough intro\u00ad duction to the varied aspects of modern chemistry for students who do not wish to pursue their studies beyond the introductory level. In order to enroll in Chemistry lA, students must pass the Chem\u00ad istry Placement Examination, which is given in late spring, sum\u00ad mer, and during Orientation Week prior to the beginning of fall quarter. A preparatory course, Chemistry lP, is offered in summer and fall for those who do not pass the Chemistry Placement Exam\u00ad ination or who need additional preparation prior to entering Chem\u00ad istry lA. A grade of Cor better in Chemistry lP automatically qualifies the student for Chemistry lA. UC IRVINE - 1996-1997Completion of a one-year sequence in organic chemistry, either Chemistry 51A-B-C or 52A-B-C, is required for Chemistry majors and for students of the life sciences. Certain advanced courses required of Chemistry majors may also be of interest to others. The undergraduate program of the Chemistry Department empha\u00ad sizes close contact with research. Chemistry majors are urged to engage in research or independent study under the direction of a faculty member. A handout describing the procedures for arranging an undergraduate research opportunity is available from the Chem\u00ad istry Undergraduate Affairs Office, 248/250 Physical Sciences I. Much of the important chemical literature is being and has been printed in foreign languages, principally German, Russian, Japanese, and French. Reading competence in one or more of these languages is desirable, and many graduate schools require the demonstration of such competence as a prerequisite for an advanced degree. Chemistry majors are encouraged to acquire this competence. Chemistry majors who are interested in teaching chemistry at the secondary level are urged to contact the UCI Department of Educa\u00ad tion. A two-year post-baccalaureate program leading to the M.S. in Chemistry and a California Secondary Teaching Credential is described in the Chemistry Graduate Program section. Chemistry majors who plan subsequent study in medical, dental, or other pro\u00ad fessional schools should request information concerning admission requirements directly from the schools which they seek to enter. Counseling about preparation for a career in the health sciences is provided by the health science advisors in the School of Biological Sciences. Those intending to pursue graduate studies in chemistry should discuss their plans with a faculty member no later than the fall quarter of their senior year. Admission to the Major Students may be admitted to the Chemistry major upon entering the University as freshmen, via change of major, and as transfer students from other colleges and universities. Information about change of major policies is available in the Physical Sciences Stu\u00ad dent Affairs Office. For transfer student admission, preference will be given to junior-level applicants with the highest grades overall, and who have satisfactorily completed the following required courses: one year of general chemistry with laboratory and one year of approved calculus.

Scientific Breadth Requirements: A total of six additional four\u00ad or five-unit courses chosen from the offerings of the Departments of Earth System Science, Mathematics, Physics and Astronomy, and Information and Computer Science, and the Schools of Biolog\u00ad ical Sciences and Engineering, excluding the following: Earth Sys\u00ad tem Science 20E-F, Mathematics H90A, Physics 1, Physics 3A-B\u00ad C, Physics H90A, and courses which are designed primarily for upper-division writing or tutoring credit. No more than two quar\u00ad ters of the requirement may be met with independent study or research courses. (These may be taken on a Pass/Not Pass basis subject to the usual restrictions on Pass/Not Pass enrollment.) HONORS PROGRAM IN CHEMISTRY The Honors Program in Chemistry is a research-based program offered to selected Chemistry majors during their final year. Appli\u00ad cants to the program must have completed their junior year with a grade point average of at least 3.3 overall and in their Chemistry courses. They must also have demonstrated the potential of carrying out research of honors quality, as judged by the Chemistry faculty member who will supervise their research. Students in this program enroll in Honors Research in Chemistry (Chemistry Hl80A-B-C) throughout their senior year and submit a formal thesis late in the spring quarter. They also enroll in the Honors Seminar in Chem\u00ad istry (Chemistry H181), in which they receive instruction in scien\u00ad tific writing and present a formal research seminar. Successful completion of Chemistry Hl81 satisfies the UCI upper-division writing requirement. Students who complete these requirements, whose grade point average remains above the 3.3 standard, and whose research is judged to be of honors quality will graduate with Departmental Honors in Chemistry. The Department also offers an Honors General Chemistry series, H2A-B-C. This course in general chemistry is designed for mem\u00ad bers of the Campus wide Honors Program (CHP) and other highly qualified students. It covers the same material as Chemistry lA-B\u00ad C, but in greater depth. Additional information is available from the Chemistry Undergrad\u00ad uate Affairs Office. PLANNING A PROGRAM OF STUDY The departmental requirements leave the student a great deal of latitude in choice of courses; the student can choose to pursue interests ranging from biochemistry on the one hand to chemical physics on the other. Many of the basic requirements above coin\u00ad cide with those of the School of Biological Sciences. For this rea\u00ad son a double major in Chemistry and Biological Sciences is popu\u00ad lar and requires little extra course work. The Department is approved by the American Chemical Society to offer an undergrad\u00ad uate degree certified by the Society as suitable background for a career in chemistry or for graduate study in chemistry. While it is not mandatory, it is desirable for students to pursue a course of study that the Department judges to merit a certified degree. Specifically, the following courses must be included in the pro\u00ad gram of study: two courses from Mathematics 2D-F, 3A, 3D; Chemistry 152 and 153; at least one advanced laboratory course from Chemistry 156, 160, 170, and 180. These courses must be taken for a letter grade. UC IRVINE - 1996-1997I 276 UCI 1996-97 School of Physical Sciences Students should consult with their academic advisors on courses of study. A Chemistry major normally takes Chemistry !A-B-C and lLB-LC, Mathematics 2A-B-C, and required writing courses dur\u00ad ing the freshman year. The sophomore year should include Chem\u00ad istry 52A-B-C and 52LA-LB-LC 5A-B-C and 5LB-LC sequences should be completed no later than the fall quarter of the junior year. The balance of the freshman and sophomore program can be chosen at the student's qiscretion with consideration given to progress toward completion of the UCI breadth requirement and the Chemistry Department sci\u00ad entific breadth requirement. In the junior year all Chemistry majors should enroll in a year sequence of physical chemistry and in Chemistry 151 (fall), 107 (winter), and 107L (spring). Chemistry 130A-B-C and 131A-B-C are parallel courses in physical chemistry; both are acceptable to satisfy the physical chemistry requirements for the major. Chemistry 130A-B-C, designed specifically for students with career interests in biochemistry, biophysics, physiology, and other basic life sci\u00ad ences, emphasizes applications of physical chemistry to liquid solutions, macromolecules, and other topics of biological rele\u00ad vance. Because of these significant differences in course content, students starting in one series may not switch to the other in subse\u00ad quent quarters. During the junior and senior years the Chemistry Department elec\u00ad tives requirement should be fulfilled, as should other University and departmental requirements. Sample programs for Chemistry majors, American Chemical Soci\u00ad ety-certified Chemistry majors, and Chemistry-Biological Sciences double majors are shown in the accompanying charts. Sample pro\u00ad grams for Chemistry majors wishing to emphasize chemical physics, computational or theoretical chemistry, chemical synthesis and reactivity, materials or polymer science, or public school science teaching in their undergraduate programs are available from the Chemistry Undergraduate Affairs Office, 248/250 Physical Sciences I.

Satellite or Lab or Lab or Lab Breadth/Elective Breadth/Elective Breadth (upper- division writing) Graduate Program The Department offers graduate programs leading to the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in Chemistry. The Ph.D. degree is granted in recog\u00ad nition of breadth and depth of knowledge of the facts and theories of modern chemistry and an ability to carry out independent chem\u00ad ical research demonstrated through submission of an acceptable doctoral dissertation. The M.S. degree may be earned either through submission of an acceptable Master's thesis (Plan I) or through an approved program of graduate course work (Plan II). A Master's degree is not a prerequisite for admission to the Ph.D. program. Upon entering the graduate programs, all students are required to take a series of Area Examinations which test the students' compe\u00ad tence in the general areas of chemistry (e.g., organic, physical, inorganic) at the undergraduate level. The Area Examinations are designed to ensure a proper fundamental level of preparation for graduate study and are used as a guide in choosing the appropriate program of course work for each entering student. Students in the Ph.D. and M.S. Plan I (Thesis) programs are required to complete a minimum of seven approved courses (or 28 units), including six graduate-level courses (or 24 units), in chem\u00ad istry. The M.S. Plan II (Course Work) program requires that the student complete 10 graduate-level chemistry courses (or 40 units). Graduate students are expected to attain grades of B or better to remain in good academic standing. Progress toward the Ph.D. degree during the first year is assessed by a written examination administered early in the second year of study. This examination covers either research accomplishments during the first year or comprehensive knowledge acquired in course work, depending upon the student's specific area of interest. Training in teaching is an integral part of each graduate program, and all graduate degree candidates are expected to participate in the teaching program for at least four quarters during their gradu\u00ad ate career. UC IRVINE - 1996-1997Participants in the Ph.D. program take an oral examination for for\u00ad mal Advancement to Candidacy. This examination normally comes in a student's second or third graduate year and consists of an oral defense before a faculty committee of the student's dissertation research project, and an original research proposition conceived, developed, and documented by the student. The committee may examine the student at this time on any subject it deems relevant to the independent pursuit of chemical research. The most important component of the Ph.D. program is the doc\u00ad toral dissertation, which must describe the results of original research performed by the student under the supervision of a fac\u00ad ulty member of the Department. The criterion for acceptability of the dissertation is that its contents be of a quality suitable for pub\u00ad lication in a scientific journal of high editorial standards. Each Ph.D. candidate is expected to present the work described in the completed dissertation in a seminar before the Department, follow\u00ad ing which the candidate will be examined in public on the contents of the dissertation by a committee of the faculty. A Master's thesis presented in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the M.S. under Plan I must also describe the results of a student's original research performed under the direction of a faculty member. How\u00ad ever, no public oral defense of the Master's thesis is required. Residency requirements specify a minimum of six quarters in residence at UCI for Ph.D. candidates and three quarters for M.S. candidates. CONCENTRATION IN PROTEIN ENGINEERING SCIENCE Several faculty in the Department of Chemistry, in conjunction with faculty in the School of Biological Sciences and the School of Engineering, participate in the joint graduate program in Protein Engineering. This interdisciplinary graduate program offers stu\u00ad dents the opportunity to work with faculty in any of the participat\u00ad ing academic units; take course work in the areas of protein struc\u00ad ture, function, and molecular biology; and earn the Ph.D. in Chemistry, Biological Sciences, or Engineering with a concentra\u00ad tion in Protein Engineering Science. Additional information is available in the School of Biological Sciences section of the Cata\u00ad logue and through the graduate program in Protein Engineering office in the Biological Sciences Administration Building. MASTER OF SCIENCE IN CHEMISTRY WITH A TEACHING CREDENTIAL In cooperation with the UCI Department of Education, the Chem\u00ad istry Department sponsors a coordinated two-year program leading to the M.S. degree in Chemistry and the California Single Subject Teaching Credential. The M.S. degree may be obtained under either Plan I or Plan II described below. Prospective graduate stu\u00ad dents interested in this program should so indicate on their gradu\u00ad ate application and should request a detailed description of the pro\u00ad gram from the Chemistry Department Graduate Affairs Office or the Department of Education. The following lists specify requirements for each of the graduate programs offered by the Department of Chemistry.

Sherwood Rowland, Ph.D. University of Chicago, Research Professor of . Chemistry and Earth System Science, and Bren Chair (atmospheric chem- istry and radiochemistry) The goal of the Department of Earth System Science is to increase the scientific understanding of the Earth as a coupled system of atmosphere, ocean, and land. Undergraduate course offerings are designed to educate both science and non-science majors in the physical, chemical, and biological principles underlying global environmental problems. The Department offers graduate programs leading to M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in Earth System Science. Grad\u00ad uate study emphasizes laboratory, field, and modeling studies of global change in the environment from the perspective of physical, chemical, and biological processes occurring in and linkages among the atmosphere, the ocean, and terrestrial systems. Students are admitted to the Ph.D. program only; the Master's degree is awarded upon progress to the Ph.D. Applicants to the Earth System Science Ph.D. program should have a broad quantitative scientific background, with an undergraduate degree in natural science or related fields such as applied mathe\u00ad matics and engineering. Undergraduate preparation should involve mathematics including differential equations, a year-long sequence of physics and of chemistry, and courses in general biology, ecol\u00ad ogy, or geology. Entering graduate students plan their courses and research with the help of the Earth System Science Advisory Com\u00ad mittee of academic and research faculty. Earth System Science 281 To complete the course requirements for the Ph.D. program, a minimum of 10 approved graduate-level courses, including the core curriculum, must be completed with an average grade of B or better. All courses must be approved by the student's Advisory Committee. The core curriculum consists of: Earth System Science 201A-B-C (Earth Systems), 202 (The Principles of Atmospheric Chemistry), one quarter of 210 (Geoscience Modeling) or 212 (Atmospheric Dynamics), and at least one quarter of either 231 (Topics in Biogeochemistry) or 233 (Topics in Climate Dynamics). These courses are described below. Students are also expected to participate in the Earth System Science seminar. Additionally, stu\u00ad dents are required to complete a teaching assistant training pro\u00ad gram and, if opportunities are available, to serve as a teaching assistant. Academic Senate regulations specify a minimum period of resi\u00ad dence of six quarters for Ph.D. candidates. Enrollment in a mini\u00ad mum of 12 units of graduate/upper-division course work per quar\u00ad ter is required. Registration in every regular academic session is necessary until all requirements for the degree have been completed, unless a formal Leave of Absence is granted by the Office of Grad\u00ad uate Studies. All Ph.D. requirements must be completed within 15 quarters in residence, excluding summer quarters. Exceptions must be put to a vote of the Earth System Science faculty. A single departmental Qualifying Examination for all eligible Earth System Science students is administered each spring quarter. This examination determines the student's readiness to begin research for the dissertation and should be taken following comple\u00ad tion of the core course work, no later than the end of the spring quarter of the second year. The Qualifying Examination consists of both written and.oral parts. The written portion of the examination emphasizes breadth, general knowledge, and the ability to integrate and use information covered in the core curricl!lum and other \u00b7course work. The oral examination provides an opportunity to clar\u00ad ify questions arising from the student's performance on the written examination. Following completion of the Qualifying Examination, those stu, dents who receive a recommendation to continue Ph.D. work will pursue research on a potential dissertation topic and then take the \u00b7 Advancement to Candidacy Examination. This oral examination is given by a faculty committee, including extra-departmental faculty. Concurrent with this examination, the Ph.D. candidates present a research seminar to the entire Earth System Science Department outlining their proposed dissertation work. A dissertation based on original research and demonstrating critical judgment, intellectual synthesis, creativity, and clarity in written communication is required for the Ph.D. degree. The dissertation must summarize the results of original research performed by the student under the supervision of a faculty member of the Depart\u00ad ment. The criterion of acceptability of a dissertation is that its con\u00ad tents be judged by the committee as suitable for publication in a peer-reviewed scientific journal of high editorial standards. The dissertation may be a compilation of published papers or manu\u00ad scripts accepted for publication, so long as a major proportion of the material has been produced independently by the candidate. The format and content are approved by the Dissertation Commit\u00ad tee, and University requirements for style, format, and appearance are met. The Master's degree is awarded only to students admitted to the Ph.D. program who have completed a total of 10 courses, met the three-quarter residency requirement, and completed the Qualifying Examination. A summary of the requirements follows. UC IRVINE - 1996-1997I 282 UCI 1996-97 School of Physical Sciences DOCTOR OF PHILOSOPHY IN EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE 1.

Undergraduate mathematics courses are of several kinds: courses preparatory to advanced work in mathematics, the exact sciences, and engineering; courses for students of the social and biological sciences; and courses for liberal arts students and those planning to enter the teaching field. Admission to the Major Students may be admitted to the Mathematics major upon entering the University as freshmen, via change of major, and as transfer students from other colleges and universities. Information about change of major policies is available in the Physical Sciences Stu\u00ad dent Affairs Office. For transfer student admission, preference will be given to junior-level applicants with the highest grades overall, and who have satisfactorily completed the following required course work of one year of approved calculus.

Among the fields cov\u00ad ered are analysis, algebra, functional analysis, geometry and topol\u00ad ogy, probability and statistics, ordinary and partial differential equations, and mathematical logic. In addition to formal courses, there are seminars for advanced study toward the Ph.D. in various fields of mathematics. Topics will vary from year to year. Each seminar is conducted by a staff member specializing in the subject studied. Enrollment will be sub\u00ad ject to the approval of the instructor in charge. MASTER OF SCIENCE IN MATHEMATICS The Department offers four pathways which lead to the Master of Science in Mathematics degree: Pure Mathematics, Applied Mathe\u00ad matics, Applied Mathematical Statistics, and the Master of Science with a Teaching Credential. The first three programs are described below; the last is described in the next section. The Master's program serves a dual purpose. For some students it will be a terminal program of mathematics education; for others it will lead to study and research at the doctoral level. To earn the Master of Science degree, the student must satisfy course, lan\u00ad guage, and residency requirements, and pass a comprehensive examination administered by the Graduate Studies Committee of the Department. There are three areas of concentration: Pure Mathematics, Applied Mathematics, and Applied Mathematical Statistics. Each concen\u00ad tration requires the satisfactory completion of 12 upper-division or graduate lecture courses; this includes a core of nine courses (36 units), in each of which the student must earn a grade of B (3.0) or better, and three elective courses (9 to 12 units). At least eight of these courses must be at the graduate level (200-series courses). The specific requirements are described below. A grade point aver\u00ad age of at least B (3.0) is required for all courses applicable to the M.S. degree. The student's selection of alternative or elective courses must be approved by the Graduate Studies Committee. The nine required core courses for the Pure Mathematics concen\u00ad tration are Mathematics 210A-B-C, 220A-B-C, and 230A-B-C. The student must complete three additional approved courses. The nine required core courses for the Applied Mathematics con\u00ad centration are Mathematics 210A-B-C, 220A-B-C, and the A-B-C sequence of one of the following: Mathematics 201, 292, 295, or Physics 212. The student must complete three additional approved courses; these may be selected from the preceding list. The nine required core courses for the Applied Mathematical Sta\u00ad tistics concentration are Mathematics 201A-B-C and 201LA-LB\u00ad 204A-B and 204LA-LB, and either 203A-B-C or 210A-B-C. In order to satisfy the Comprehensive Examination requirement in the regular Master's program in Mathematics, a student in either the Pure Mathematics concentration or the Applied Mathematics concentration must pass two of the three written Area Examina\u00ad tions (see the Ph.D. program below) at the Master's level or better. In the Applied Mathematical Statistics concentration, however, the Comprehensive Examination ordinarily is comprised of the final examinations in the following courses: Mathematics 201C, 202, and 204B. Students must satisfy the language requirement by demonstrating reading proficiency in French, German, or Russian. Proficiency in a higher level programming language may be substituted for French, German, or Russian only for the Master's degree with con\u00ad centration in applied mathematical statistics. Mathematics 285 The residency requirement ordinarily is satisfied by full-time enrollment for three quarters immediately preceding the award of the M.S. degree. When appropriate, a leave of absence may be granted between matriculation and the final quarters of study. Master of Science in Mathematics with a Teaching Credential In cooperation with the UCI Department of Education, the Depart\u00ad ment of Mathematics sponsors a coordinated two-year program leading to the M.S. degree in Mathematics and the California Sin\u00ad gle Subject Teaching Credential. In this program the M.S. degree can be obtained under one of two plans: either Plan I (Thesis) or Plan II (Comprehensive Examination). Prospective graduate stu\u00ad dents interested in this program should so indicate on their applica\u00ad tions and should request a detailed description of the program from the Department of Mathematics or the Department of Education. DOCTOR OF PHILOSOPHY IN MATHEMATICS A student seeking the Ph.D. in Mathematics must demonstrate mastery in the three basic areas of Real Analysis, Complex Analy\u00ad sis, and Algebra, by (a) passing Mathematics 210A-B-C, 220A-B\u00ad C, and 230A-B-C (or approved equivalents) with a grade of B or better; and (b) passing three written Area Examinations, one for each of these basic areas, at the Ph.D. level. The Area Examina\u00ad tions, which include both undergraduate and graduate material, are normally given twice each year, just before the start of the fall and winter quarters. All students seeking the Ph.D. degree must suc\u00ad cessfully complete these examinations within two years of entering the graduate program; students admitted to the Ph.D. program with a Master's degree in mathematics from another institution must successfully complete at least one of these examinations within one year (and complete the rest within two years). The Department also requires the following for advancement to candidacy for the Ph.D. degree: satisfactory performance at the post-Master's level in nine approved one-quarter graduate lecture courses, which must exclude Mathematics 201, 202, 204, 210, 220, 230, 298, 299, and 399; satisfactory performance in one language examination (French, German, or Russian); and satisfactory perfor\u00ad mance in the oral qualifying examination. The oral qualifying examination is conducted by a candidacy com\u00ad mittee, appointed by Department on behalf of the Dean of Gradu\u00ad ate Studies and the Graduate Council, including at least one mem\u00ad ber of the faculty outside of the Mathematics Department. After the student meets the requirements, the Graduate Studies Committee recommends to the Dean of Graduate Studies the advancement to candidacy for the Ph.D. degree. Teaching experience and training is an integral part of the Ph.D. program. All doctoral students are expected to participate in the teaching program of the Department. The candidate must demonstrate independent, creative research in mathematics by writing and defending a dissertation that makes a new and valuable contribution to mathematics in the candidate's area of concentration. Following advancement to candidacy, a doc\u00ad toral committee, appointed by the Department Chair on behalf of the Dean of Graduate Studies and the Graduate Council, guides and supervises the candidate's research, study, and writing of the dissertation; conducts an oral defense of the dissertation; and rec\u00ad ommends that the Ph.D. be conferred upon approval of the doctoral dissertation.

Yodh, Ph.D. University of Chicago, Professor of Physics (experimental particle physics) Clare Yu, Ph.D. Princeton University, Associate Professor of Physics (condensed matter theory) Physics is that branch of science concerned with the study of nat\u00ad ural phenomena at the fundamental level. Physicists study the smallest particles of matter (quarks and leptons), nuclei, and atoms; the fundamental forces; the properties of solids, liquids, gases, and plasmas; the behavior of matter on the grand scale in stars and galaxies; and even the origin and fate of the universe. Other disciplines such as chemistry, biology, medicine, and engi\u00ad neering often build upon the foundations laid by physics. The Department of Physics and Astronomy offers courses for stu\u00ad dents of various interests, from those in the humanities and social sciences, to those in biological sciences, and to those in physics, engineering, and other sciences. Faculty members are conducting active research in several forefront areas of physical research, and there is student access to specialized research areas such as ele\u00ad mentary particles, plasma physics, astrophysics, and condensed matter at both advanced and undergraduate course levels. The fac\u00ad ulty is vigorous, innovative, and engaged in everything from the traditional activities of research, education, and university service to community action, literature, and national policy making, to mention a few examples. The Department encourages student-fac\u00ad ulty interaction. The Department consists of people committed to intellectual activities and is exciting to those who are so inclined. Undergraduate Program Courses in the Department are designed to meet the needs of many kinds of students, from those students without facility in mathe\u00ad matics whose main interests lie in the humanities or the arts to those students with professional goals in science and engineering. The Physics major, concentrations in Applied Physics and Biomed\u00ad ical Physics, and a specialization in Astrophysics are offered. The four lower-division sequences in physics are distinguished by their intended audience, their mathematical prerequisites, and the extent to which they offer preparation for more advanced courses. These aspects of the beginning courses are summarized as follows: Physics 3: Intended audience: Premedical students, Biological Sci\u00ad ences majors. Prerequisites: algebra and trigonometry; concurrent enrollment in Mathematics 2. Preparation for advanced courses: Physics SC with permission. Physics 5: Intended audience: Physics, Chemistry, Mathematics, and Engineering majors. Prerequisites: Mathematics 2A (Calcu\u00ad lus); Physics 1 or passing score on physics placement test. Prepa\u00ad ration for advanced courses: all upper-division courses in physics. Physics H6: Intended audience: Physics, Chemistry, Mathematics, and Engineering majors. Prerequisites: Advanced Placement (AP) mathematics and physics or passing scores on physics placement test. Preparation for advanced courses: all upper-division courses in physics. \u00b7 Physics 16-24: Intended audience: Nonscience majors. Prerequi\u00ad sites: none. Preparation for Advanced courses: none. Admission to the Major Students may be admitted to the Physics major upon entering the University as freshmen, via change of major, and as transfer stu\u00ad dents from other colleges and universities. Information about change of major policies is available in the Physical Sciences Stu\u00ad dent Affairs Office. For transfer student admission, preference will be given to junior-level applicants with the highest grades overall, and who have satisfactorily completed the following required courses: one year of approved calculus and one year of calculus\u00ad based physics with laboratory. REQUIREMENTS FOR THE BACHELOR'S DEGREE University Requirements: See pages S7-6l. School Requirements: None. Departmental Requirements Physics SA-B-C (or H6A-B-C) and SD-E laboratory courses Physics lllA-B-C, 112A-B-C, 113A\u00b7 B, and liS; (Physics 120- 123); Mathematics 2A-B-C-D, 3A, and 3D; and four additional coherently related four-unit upper-division courses chosen from the Schools of Physical Sciences, Biological Sciences, Engineering, or the Department of Information and Computer Science. Students who complete a program in Applied Physics, Biomedical Physics, or Astrophysics fulfill this requirement with course work taken in satisfaction of concentration or specialization requirements. Requirements for the Concentration in Applied Physics The requirements of the concentration in Applied Physics include all the requirements of the Physics degree plus six courses in engi\u00ad neering approved by the Department of Physics and Astronomy. If these courses include Electrical and Computer Engineering 110A\u00ad B, the advanced laboratory requirement is reduced to one quarter of Physics 121-123. Requirements for the Concentration in Biomedical Physics The requirements of the concentration in Biomedical Physics include all the requirements of the Physics degree (except the four additional coherently related upper-division science electives), plus the following: Biological Sciences 94, 97, and Chemistry 1A-B-C, lLB-LC, SlA-B, SlLA-LB (or S2A-B and S2LA-LB). Requirements for the Specialization in Astrophysics The requirements of the specialization in Astrophysics include all the requirements of the Physics degree plus the three astrophysics courses (Physics 137, 144, 14S) and any two of the four special topics courses (Physics 132, 134, 13S, 136). Mathematics 2E is strongly recommended during the sophomore year. UC IRVINE - 1996-1997Honors Program in Physics The Honors Program in Physics provides an opportunity for selected students majoring in Physics to pursue advanced work in one of the research areas of the Department. Admission to the pro\u00ad gram is based on an application normally submitted by the sixth week of the spring quarter of the junior year. Applicants must have an overall grade point average of at least 3.4 and a grade point average in physics courses of 3.S or better. (Exceptions to these procedures and standards may be granted in unusual circum\u00ad stances.) In selecting students for the program, the Department considers evidence of ability and interest in research. Students admitted to the program participate in a year-long course, Physics H196A-B-C, which includes two quarters of research and a final quarter in which a written thesis is submitted. If this work and the student's final GPA are deemed of honors quality by the program advisor, the student then graduates with Departmental Honors in Physics. Additional information and program applications are available in the Department Office. PLANNING A PROGRAM OF STUDY Physics 3 is a one-year course suitable for premedical students, students majoring in Biological Sciences, and nonscience majors. It surveys most of the important branches of physics. Laboratory work accompanies the course. Nonscience majors with some mathematical skill may wish to consider Physics 3 as an alternative to Physics 16 through 24. A student who decides to major in Physics after completing Physics 3 with a grade of A or B may, with the consent of the Department, enroll in Physics SC. The premedical physics require\u00ad ments may be met with Physics 3, SA-B-C, or H6A-B-C. Physics 1 (or a satisfactory examination score as explained in the Physics SA course description) is a prerequisite for the Physics S sequence and offers a review of math and problem-solving tech\u00ad niques in the context of introducing physics. Physics S is an intensive five-quarter course for students in physics, chemistry, engineering, and other areas who are interested in a careful quantitative approach to the subject. Laboratory work accompanies the course. Students expecting to enroll in the entire five-quarter sequence of Physics S should enroll in Mathematics 2D concurrently with Physics SC. Students planning to enroll in only three quarters of Physics Sneed not enroll in Mathematics 2D. Physics H6A-B-C is an honors sequence for the student with a strong background in calculus. The content parallels Physics SA-B\u00ad C, but includes more mathematical sophistication and phenomeno\u00ad logical material. Physics 9 is an introduction to the use of computers in Physics. Physics courses numbered between 16 and 24 are general educa\u00ad tion courses intended for nonscience majors. The content and for\u00ad mat of Physics 21 through 24 will vary from year to year. Courses numbered 111 and above are for Physics majors and other qualified students. This series of courses in the upper-division cur\u00ad riculum is sufficiently broad to provide programs both for the Physics major who does not intend to pursue the study of physics beyond the Bachelor's degree level and for the Physics major preparing for a professional career in physics. Courses numbered between 111 and 116 emphasize the mathematical and theoretical structures that have unified our understanding of nature. It should be noted that multi-quarter courses such as 113A-B-C must be taken and passed in sequential order. Laboratory work is assigned to separate courses, numbered 120-123. Any Physics major who is so inclined may take more than the minimum two quarters of advanced laboratory work. Courses numbered between 132 and 149 introduce active subdisciplines in current research. The Physics and Astronomy 291 Physics major with a career goal, for example, in law, teaching, or business should emphasize the Physics 130 series, which covers most of the important phenomena of physics. Every Physics major is encouraged to participate in independent research (19S, 196). Transfer students are specifically advised to seek individual con\u00ad sultation with a member of the Physics and Astronomy faculty before deciding on a program of courses. Every Physics major should avoid overspecialization and wisely use undergraduate years to explore some areas remote from physics. Introductory courses in biology and chemistry are recom\u00ad mended options. Note also that alternatives to Physics major requirements can be approved upon petition to the Department and the Office of the Associate Dean. Furthermore, exceptionally prepared students are allowed to enroll in graduate-level courses; to do so requires the approval of the Physics and Astronomy Department Undergraduate Committee. As a guide to preparing a suitable program, the Department makes the following suggestions: Physics majors considering the possibility of graduate school in engineering should complete the Applied Physics requirements. The course program of Physics majors considering graduate work in chemistry, biology, or various interdisciplinary areas should con\u00ad tain: Chemistry 1A-B-C and S1A-B-C, and selected courses from the Biological Sciences core curriculum. The concentration in Biomedical Physics is offered for Physics majors who wish to follow an integrated program which combines biology and/or chemistry with physics, and is suitable preparation for a graduate career in one of these interdisciplinary areas. The course program of Physics majors considering a teaching career in the public schools or the community colleges should con\u00ad tain: Education 173 and additional preparation in some other area of science or mathematics. Courses from the Physics 16 through 24 sequence may be appropriate. The course program of Physics majors considering graduate work in the history of science should contain courses from History 60 and 186, Philosophy 40 and 140. Courses from the Physics 16 through 24 sequence may be appropriate. Sample Program -Physics A typical course program for Physics majors considering the possibility of graduate study in physics is shown below.

It combines the fundamental knowledge of physical processes obtained from physics courses with the technical knowl\u00ad edge obtained from engineering courses, particularly electrical engineering courses. In addition to the basic courses in physics, a student is required to complete six courses in the School of Engi\u00ad neering approved by the Physics and Astronomy Department. Examples of appropriate courses include completion of the Applied Physics concentration, the student will receive a B.S. degree in Physics.

Elective Elective A typical course program for Physics majors in the Applied Physics concentration differs from the Physics major program pri\u00ad marily in the junior and senior years. NOTE: Most upper-division Engineering courses have several lower-division prerequisites which should be completed before the junior year; for example ECEll and ECE70A are prerequisites to most upper-division courses in Electrical Engineering. Program Planning-Biomedical Physics The Biomedical Physics concentration is designed for the student who anticipates a career in physics applied to biology and medi\u00ad cine, such as health physics or radiological physics, or who intends to work in a scholarly field which deals with the physical aspects of biology or medicine, such as molecular biology or physiology. Completion of requirements for the Physics major is required as are nine quarters of basic courses in biology and chemistry. Stu\u00ad dents who wish to follow the Biomedical Physics concentration are advised to seek guidance early in their college careers. The requirements are such that coordination of a program in the first and second years is essential. Program Planning-Astrophysics The Astrophysics specialization is primarily for students planning graduate work in astronomy or astrophysics. It also is a suitable \u00b7focus for students who do not plan to pursue a graduate degree but anticipate a career in science journalism, teaching, science administration, or public relations. The course work includes that of the standard Physics major plus three courses in astrophysics (Physics 137, 144, 145) and two courses in related branches of physics (selected from Physics 132, 134, 135, and 136).

Active pro\u00ad grams of research are underway in high energy physics, condensed matter physics, low temperature physics, plasma physics, mathe\u00ad matical physics, gravitational physics, and astrophysics. In general, graduate study in physics is expected to be a full-time activity. Other proposed arrangements should be approved by the Graduate Committee. Completion of the Ph.D. typically requires six years of full-time study. Complementing the formal courses, the Department offers regular colloquia and informal seminars. The graduate student is a member of an intellectual community and is expected to participate fully in departmental activities. Attendance at colloquia is considered an essential part of graduate study. In addition, there are regular weekly research seminars in condensed matter, high energy, plasma physics, and astrophysics. UC IRVINE - 1996-1997Sources of support available to graduate students include teaching assistantships, research assistantships, and fellowships. Students planning to pursue graduate work in physics should obtain a copy of the Department's graduate brochure. MASTER OF SCIENCE IN PHYSICS The requirements for the M.S. degree are: (I) at least three quar\u00ad ters of residence; and (2) mastery of graduate course material, which may be demonstrated by passing, with a grade of B or bet\u00ad ter, a minimum of nine quarter courses numbered between 200 and 259, including 211, 213A-B, 214A, and 215A-B, and a written comprehensive examination. Under special circumstances, a research project and thesis may be accepted in lieu of a written comprehensive examination. There is no foreign language require\u00ad ment for the M.S. degree. In addition to the stated course require\u00ad ments, all students who have not passed the Ph.D. qualifying examination must register for Physics 264 (Seminar in Conceptual Physics). A typical program in preparation for the written examination for the M.S. degree would consist of 12 courses: 211 213C, 214C, 215C, or undergraduate upper-division courses in related areas. DOCTOR OF PHILOSOPHY IN PHYSICS The principal requirements for the Ph.D. degree are a minimum of six quarters of residence, passage of a written and a two-part oral examination, and successful completion and defense of a disserta\u00ad tion reporting results of original research. In addition, the Ph.D. candidate must complete certain graduate course requirements. There is no foreign language requirement for the Ph.D. degree. Course Requirements. The student is required to exhibit mastery of the basic sequences, Mathematical Physics, Classical Mechan\u00ad ics, Electromagnetic Theory, Quantum Mechanics, Relativistic Quantum Mechanics, and Statistical Mechanics. A minimum of 15 quarter courses numbered between 200 and 259, including 211, 212A-B, 213A-B, 214A-B, and 215A-B-C, must be passed with a grade of B or better. Students are strongly encouraged to take Physics 211, 212A-B-C, 213A-B, and 215A-B-C in their first year of study. In addition, all students who have not passed the Ph.D. qualifying examination are required to register for Physics 264. It is expected that students, having selected a research specialty, will ordinarily take the core course in that subject (236A-B-C, 237 A-B\u00ad C, 238A-B-C, or 239A-B-C-D) early in their graduate career. Qualifying Examination. For advancement to Ph.D. candidacy, a student must pass a qualifying examination consisting of a written part and two oral parts. The written part, covering a broad range of fundamentals of physics at the advanced undergraduate and gradu\u00ad ate levels, is normally taken in the fall following the student's first year. The first oral examination is administered along with the written examination. All members of the first oral committee will be from the Department of Physics and Astronomy. A second attempt at this set of examinations will be permitted if the first is not successful. A third attempt will be permitted only in extraordi\u00ad nary circumstances. The second part of the oral examination will be taken approxi\u00ad mately one year after successful completion of the written exami\u00ad nation and the first oral. The candidacy committee that administers the second oral examination will contain one or two faculty mem\u00ad bers from outside the Department. The second oral will cover material principally related to the broad and general features of the student's dissertation area. Physics and Astronomy 293 Teaching Program. Experience in teaching is an integral part of the graduate program, and all graduate students are expected to participate in the teaching program for at least three quarters dur\u00ad ing their graduate careers. All new teaching assistants are required to enroll in Physics 269. Dissertation. A dissertation summarizing the results of original re\u00ad search performed by the student under the supervision of a doctor\u00ad al committee, appointed by the Department Chair on behalf of the Dean of Graduate Studies and the Graduate Council, will be required for the Ph.D. degree, A criterion for the acceptability of a dissertation by the Department is that it be suitable for publication in a scientific journal. The dissertation must not have been submit\u00ad ted to any other institution prior to its submission to the UCI Physics and Astronomy Department. Defense of Dissertation. Upon completion of the dissertation, the student will take an oral examination, open to the public, before the doctoral committee. Suggested Course Sequence.

The School is comprised of the Departments of Criminology, Law and Society; Environmental Analysis and Design; Psychology and Social Behavior; and Urban and Regional Planning. It has 48 full\u00ad time faculty, 1,600 undergraduate majors, and 130 graduate stu\u00ad dents. Social ecology applies scientific methods to the study of a wide range of recurring social and environmental problems. Among issues of long-standing interest in the School are crime and justice in society, social influences on human development over the life cycle, and effects of the physical environment on health and behavior. The School maintains a central interest in human adapta\u00ad tion and a special, but not exclusive, interest in the study of events in the natural settings in which they occur. The faculty is multidisciplinary. It includes psychologists with a variety of specialties (e.g., developmental, clinical, social, and environmental psychology), sociologists, program evaluators, crim\u00ad inologists, lawyers, urban and regional planners, environmental health scientists, and environmental design specialists. Faculty members conduct research and teach courses that integrate concepts and perspectives of several disciplines. This focus arises from commitment to the view that the analysis of complex societal prob\u00ad lems requires interdisciplinary efforts (i.e., the joining of talents by people with different intellectual backgrounds). A number of fac\u00ad ulty members are involved in interventions directed toward improving the way groups of individuals, institutions, and commu\u00ad nities fup.ction; a number of others are involved in interventions aimed at improving the quality and control of the environment. Research Facilities The Social Ecology Building features several facilities for experi\u00ad mental research, including wet laboratories for research and teach\u00ad ing in the environmental health sciences; behavioral assessment laboratories for research \u00b7in human development, social relations, and legal studies; anq ap environmental simulation laboratory for studying the effects of environmental conditions. The wet laborato\u00ad ries are used for studying air and water pollution. The behavioral assessment laboratories are used for studying social phenomena such as parent-child interaction, cooperation among children, hyperactivity, social support processes, and mock jury discussions. The environmental simulation laboratory permits full-scale, realis\u00ad tic simulations of interior environments such as offices, class\u00ad rooms, and apartments. Within these settings, physical conditions (e.g., ambient lighting and color patterns, music and noise, spatial arrangements and physical density) and social processes (e.g., group communication patterns) can be varied experimentally so that researchers can assess the separate and joint effects of these conditions and processes upon occupants' performance and well\u00ad being.

Eligibility for such honors will be on the basis of grade point average. A minimum overall GPA of 3.5 is required. A general criterion is that students must have completed at least 72 units in residence at a University of California campus. Final deci\u00ad sions concerning the awards of summa cum laude, magna cum laude, and cum laude are the responsibility of a committee chaired by the Associate Dean for Undergraduate Studies. Other important factors are considered (see page 55). Undergraduate Program The School of Social Ecology offers either a general interdiscipli\u00ad nary degree in Social Ecology or a more focused experience through degree programs in Applied Ecology, Criminology, Law and Society; Environmental Analysis and Design; and Psychology and Social Behavior. Continuing-Student Applicants. Due to the high demand for admission to the School of Social Ecology, not all eligible continu\u00ad ing-student applicants may be accommodated at the time they may wish to change or declare a major within the School. Interested students should apply during the first three weeks of the spring quarter in the Social Ecology Undergraduate Counseling Office. UC IRVINE - 1996-1997The following criteria must be met to be considered for admission into the School of Social Ecology. General Social Ecology major; Criminology, Law and Society major; and Environmental Analysis and Design major: (a) completion of the Subject A requirement; (b) completion of two of the Social Ecology lower-division core courses, one of which must be in the major of your choice, with a minimum grade of a C in both courses (see School Requirements); (c) an overall minimum 2.3 GPA. Psychology and Social Behavior major: (a) completion of the Subject A requirement; (b) completion of two of the Social Ecol\u00ad ogy lower-division courses, one of which must be Psychology and Social Behavior P9, Introduction to Human Behavior, with a mini\u00ad mum grade of a C in both courses (see School Requirements); (c) an overall minimum 2.5 GPA. Applied Ecology major: (a) completion of the Subject A require\u00ad ment; (b) completion of two courses selected from Environmental Analysis and Design E5 or E8, Chemistry 1A-B-C, Biological Sci\u00ad ences core curriculum, with a grade of a C or better in both courses. Selection criteria are subject to change. Students should consult with the Social Ecology Undergraduate Counseling Office for cur\u00ad rent information. HONORS PROGRAM IN SOCIAL ECOLOGY The Social Ecology Honors Program provides the opportunity for selected School of Social Ecology students to pursue advanced independent study. Admission to the program is based on formal application normally submitted in the spring quarter of the junior year. In order to be considered, a student must have satisfied the following requirements: completion of all lower-division Social Ecology courses required for the major; completion of at least five upper-division Social Ecology courses with a grade point average of at least 3.5 in these courses; and achievement of an overall grade point average at UCI of at least 3.2. Invitation to the pro\u00ad gram is based upon evidence of the student's ability, interest in research, and proposed thesis project. Successful completion of the program requires two quarters of supervised, independent work on a thesis research project (Social Ecology H190A-B) and written and oral presentation of an honors thesis (Social Ecology H190W). CAREER OPPORTUNITIES Graduates of the School of Social Ecology bring a distinctive cross-disciplinary perspective to the job market. The School pro\u00ad vides a solid foundation for those students who seek jobs in plan\u00ad ning departments, mental health settings, educational institutions, and a variety of community and governmental agencies. Many Social Ecology students find that their interdisciplinary training is also useful for careers in management. The School also provides sound preparation for students who wish to apply to graduate and professional schools of law, administra\u00ad tion, public health, social welfare, psychology, sociology, criminol\u00ad ogy, and urban planning. The Career and Life Planning Center provides services to UCI stu\u00ad dents and alumni including career counseling, information about job opportunities, a career library, and workshops on resume preparation, job search, and interview techniques. Additional infor\u00ad mation is available in the Career and Life Planning Center section. FIELD STUDY An important aspect of the undergraduate program is its field study requirement for majors. Field study is designed to provide students with an opportunity to examine social-environmental problems as they occur in community settings; to evaluate the merit of ideas presented in the classroom; and to conduct naturalistic observations Social Ecology 299 and investigations at field sites. Under the supervision of a Social Ecology faculty sponsor, students have the opportunity to test their skills in the community, to evaluate procedures and problem-solv\u00ad ing strategies used in the work place, and to observe the links between community practices and academic ideas and issues. The settings provided for field study include a wide range of prob\u00ad lem-oriented institutions and agencies in both the private and the public sector (e.g., Orange County Public Defender's Office; UCI Medical Center; California Coastal Commission; primary and secondary schools; Fairview Development Center; planning, legal, and design corporations). Students must select a placement site from those listed and approved by the School of Social Ecology. Unlisted or inappropriate placements, as well as those that could give the appearance of nepotism or prefer\u00ad ential treatment, will not be approved. Departmental approval for field study will be determined by the Field Study Coordinator. Field study is open only to upper-division School of Social Ecol\u00ad ogy students who are in good academic standing and have com\u00ad pleted all prerequisite course work. All field studies are taken on a Pass/Not Pass grading basis. Further information, including field study sign-up procedures and prerequisites, must be obtained from the Social Ecology Undergraduate Counseling Office. Planning a Program of Study Because there are many alternative ways to plan a program, some of which may require careful attention to specific major require\u00ad ments, students should consult with the Undergraduate Counseling Office, 163 Social Ecology Building, to design an appropriate pro- gram of study. \u00b7 Students who elect one of the majors in the School of Social Ecol\u00ad ogy in their freshman year might begin by taking the introductory courses required by their major. It is a good idea to take these courses early because they include fundamental concepts that are widely applicable in more advanced courses. Iri addition, the lower-division writing requirement of the breadth requirement (cat\u00ad egory I) should be completed during the first year. In the sopho\u00ad more year, the student might complete three courses toward the breadth requirement, four courses in their major, and four elec\u00ad tives. Students who are planning to go on to graduate school can use their freshman and sophomore years to advantage by taking courses in theory, research methods, statistics, and other areas important to graduate study. In the junior and senior years, the stu\u00ad dent should take courses in the major area and should create an individualized program of study through a combination of courses and course modules which fall in an area of interest. Particular attention should be paid to planning a program of study that will ensure that major requirements are met prior to graduation. Requirements for the Bachelor's Degree University Requirements: See pages 57-61. School Requirements Criminology, Law and Society 17, Environmental Analysis and Design E8, Psychology and Social Behavior P9, Social Ecology 10, 13, 194, 195 (four units), and one additional upper-division course (four units) chosen from any department in the School of Social Ecology or an additional four units of Social Ecology 195.

Undergraduate Major in Applied Ecology 163 Social Ecology; (714) 824-6861 101 Biological Sciences Administration; (714) 824-5318 The School of Social Ecology and the School of Biological Sciences offer a program of undergraduate instruction leading to a B.S. degree in Applied Ecology. The interdisciplinary curriculum furnishes a Social Ecology 301 strong undergraduate foundation for students interested in advanced study .in environmental planning and resource management. An Applied Ecology major receives the basic science training of a Biological Sciences major and utilizes these skills in a core of environmentally based courses taught in Social Ecology. Social Ecology brings to this major a unique combination of courses in Environmental Quality and Health, Planning and Public Policy, and Law and Society. This combination, together with a strong biology background contributed by the School of Biological Sciences and a general science background contributed by the School of Physical Sciences, enables students selecting this major to pursue interdisci\u00ad plinary learning experiences which are difficult to achieve within traditional disciplines. The first three years of the major are very structured, leaving the last year open for students to specialize in an area of their choice. PLANNING A PROGRAM OF STUDY It is important that students take the required science courses early, in order that the science background may be utilized in the Social Ecology courses. There are many required courses, and the student must plan carefully. For initial academic advising, students should consult the Social Ecology Counseling Office or the Biological Sciences Student Affairs Office. Faculty academic advisors may be either Social Ecology or Biological Sciences faculty members. CAREERS IN APPLIED ECOLOGY Careers in the fields of environmental and resource management and planning are particularly suited to an Applied Ecology back\u00ad ground. Many graduates hold technical or administrative positions in, for example, the United States Environmental Protection Agency; or in California's Regional Water Quality Control Board, Air Resources Board, Department of Fish and Game, and Depart\u00ad ment of Health and Human Services; or in various county and city agencies. A variety of firms in the private sector employ Applied Ecology graduates to prepare environmental impact reports, labora\u00ad tory analyses, and planning studies. Industrial health professionals are in demand to help determine the safety of workplace environ\u00ad ments for the labor force. The Applied Ecology major also pro\u00ad vides a strong academic foundation for graduate or professional study in areas such as conservation and natural resources, environ\u00ad mental health science, microbiology, public health, law, medicine, planning, and administration. The Applied Ecology major provides students with a comprehen\u00ad sive treatment of basic ecological principles and their relevance to human needs.

Environmental Health Science: Biological Sciences LAW AND SOCIETY Henry N. Pontell, Department Chair The Department of Criminology, Law and Society focuses, first, on the manifestations of criminal behavior and the methods for con\u00ad trolling that behavior, and second, on the relationships and interac\u00ad tions between social processes and legal systems. Basic courses present overviews of American legal systems with particular emphasis on criminal and juvenile justice, the forms of criminal behavior, the role of law in understanding social and psychological phenomena, and the applications of sociological theory in under\u00ad standing law and legal systems. Subsequent course work provides understanding of the theoretical structures used to explain criminal behavior, the effects of crimes from the perspectives of victims, the operations of systems of justice and their underlying institutions, the goals of governmental regulation and the methods used to achieve those goals, and more advanced issues in the interactions of law and such fields as psychology, sociology, and planning. In addition, substantive areas of law, such as criminal, environmental, and family law, are introduced. The undergraduate program leads to a B.A. degree in Criminology, Law and Society. Students are provided with opportunities to become acquainted with the varieties of behavior that society chooses to control or regulate, the methods and institutions used to achieve that control or regulation, and the approaches aimed specifically at altering unacceptable behavior. In addition, there is provision for students to use their increasing knowledge of the law, its procedures, and institutions to enhance their understanding of the social sciences. The course of study provides excellent preparation for law school and for graduate study in sociology, criminology, and criminal jus\u00ad tice. Careers for students who terminate their University education at the baccalaureate level may be developed through placements in criminal justice and regulatory agencies, in organizations determin\u00ad ing public policy, and in programs that deliver services to people who have difficulties with some aspect of the legal system. Students are strongly encouraged to select electives in a variety of departments. Courses in areas such as Psychology, Sociology, Eco\u00ad nomics, and Political Science can provide a further context for the understanding of crime, law, and criminal justice, while courses in areas such as art history, theater, and music can enhance the quality of the student's entire life. Field study placements are available in police departments, public defenders' offices, probation and parole agencies, the Orange County District Attorney's Office, the State juvenile detention sys\u00ad tem, the Orange County Victim/Witness Assistance Program, juve\u00ad nile shelters, legislative offices, and in private legal firms.

DEPARTMENT OF PSYCHOLOGY AND SOCIAL BEHAVIOR Carol K. Whalen, Department Chair The Department of Psychology and Social Behavior is concerned with human behavior in social contexts. A major objective is to study variations in social environments (e.g., the family, school, workplace) that affect human behavior over the life cycle. Students begin with basic course work in developmental, social, health, and abnormal psychology. Subsequent course work examines a variety of topics pertinent to the fields of community, abnormal, develop\u00ad mental, environmental, clinical, and health psychology, and the psychological study of social problems. Courses cover such topics as psychosocial development in children, adolescents, and adults; gerontology; childhood behavior disorders and developmental psychopathology; clinical and emotion; stress and coping; and counseling and therapy. Opportunities also are available to work with faculty on research in these and other areas. The undergraduate program leads to a B.A. degree in Psy\u00ad chology and Social Behavior. Students are given a foundation that will enable them to work after graduation from UCI in the private or public sectors or to do grad\u00ad uate work in psychology, human development, public health, health services, social work, counseling, or education. Field study opportunities includ(' schools, child care facilities, community clin\u00ad ics, counseling centt\";\u00b7s, hospital settings, and social service agen\u00ad cies, among others. Students should be aware that psychology courses are offered in several different departments and programs. Students interested in developmental, clinical, environmental, health, or social psychol\u00ad ogy, or in psychology and the law, are advised to consult the course listings here in the Department of Psychology and Social Behavior section. Students interested in other areas of psychology are advised to consult the course listings in the Department of Cognitive Sciences and the School of Biological Sciences sections of the Catalogue. In addition to courses in the Department of Psychology and Social Behavior, strongly recommended courses for students who antici\u00ad pate pursuing graduate study in psychology include: Biological Sciences 1 C, when topics concern the biological bases of behavior; Social Ecology 166A-B-C (Social Science Statistics I, II, III); and Psychology 112A-B-C (Experimental Psychology), 140L (Learning Theory), and 146A (Human Memory).

UC IRVINE - 1996-1997I 312 UCI 1996-97 School of Social Ecology DEPARTMENT OF URBAN AND REGIONAL PLANNING Mark Baldassare, Department Chair Faculty research interests in the Department of Urban and Regional Planning include community attitudes and social policy, economics and public policy, land-use and growth management, transportation policy, community health planning and policy, and urban design and well-being. The Department has collaborative academic and research ties with other units on campus including the School of Social Sciences, the Graduate School of Management, and the Institute of Transporta\u00ad tion Studies. Currently, the Department offers a program of study leading to the Ph.D. degree in Urban and Regional Planning, the Master of Urban and Regional Planning degree (M.U.R.P), and an undergraduate minor in Urban and Regional Planning. Departmental faculty also teach courses within the School's under\u00ad graduate programs in Social Ecology; Criminology, Law and Soci\u00ad ety; Environmental Analysis and Design; and Psychology and Social Behavior. Ph.D. in Urban and Regional Planning: See page 316. Master of Urban and Regional Planning: See page 313. Urban and Regional Planning Minor Requirements Nine courses (36 units): Environmental Analysis and Design E8, E104U, E107U, and six additional upper-division Environmental Analysis available in the Department of Environ\u00ad mental Analysis and Design section. NOTE: A maximum of three courses may be counted toward both the minor in Urban and Regional Planning and the majors in Envi\u00ad ronmental Analysis and Design or Social Ecology. (Environmental Analysis and Design E8 is by necessity one of the three.) GRADUATE PROGRAMS Graduate training in the School of Social Ecology is organized around the study of contemporary problems in the social and phys\u00ad ical environment. Emphasis is placed primarily upon theory and research that have implications for policy and intervention. Prob\u00ad lems are investigated from the complementary perspectives of a multidisciplinary faculty that includes specialists in social, devel\u00ad opmental, clinical, environmental, and health psychology; urban and regional planning and architecture; urban sociology; law; crim\u00ad inology; and environmental health. Among issues of long-standing interest in the School are crime and justice in society, social influences on health and human develop\u00ad ment over the life course, and the effects of the physical environ\u00ad ment on health and human behavior. The graduate curriculum emphasizes an interdisciplinary orientation, training students to draw upon the knowledge offered by several of the traditional aca\u00ad demic fields in order to examine important social, legal, and envi\u00ad ronmental problems from a perspective of breadth as well as depth. Programs of study leading to the M.A., M.S., M.U.R.P., and Ph.D. degrees are offered. Doctoral students have the opportunity to pur\u00ad sue an individualized course of study in the principles and methods of social ecology, leading to the Ph.D. in Social Ecology, or a spe\u00ad cialized course of study that leads to the Ph.D. in Social Ecology with a concentration in Environmental Analysis and Design. Addi\u00ad tional programs lead to one of the following degrees: Ph.D. in Criminology, Law and Society; Ph.D. in Environmental Health Science and Policy; Ph.D. in Health Psychology; Ph.D. in Human Development; or Ph.D. in Urban and Regional Planning. Master's degree students may elect a course of study that leads to the M.A. in Social Ecology, the M.S. in Environmental Health Science and Policy, or the Master of Urban and Regional Planning. Social Ecology faculty members apply diverse methods of scien\u00ad tific inquiry to social and environmental problems. Evaluation research, legal research, questionnaire and survey methods, field research, naturalistic observation, and quasi-experimental tech\u00ad niques receive emphasis along with laboratory experimentation. Collaborative research with faculty members is an important com\u00ad ponent of graduate education in the School. A sampling of faculty research and teaching interests includes human stress, health promotion, biobehavioral bases of health and iiiness, program evaluation, economic change and behavioral dis\u00ad orders, atyp!cal child development, adaptive aging, violence and aggression, use of deadly force by police, legal sanctions and deterrence, white-collar and organized crime, transitions to parent\u00ad hood, personality and psychopathology, effects of social environ\u00ad ments on early child development, urban growth management and policies, transportation policies, poverty and homelessness, water quality, air quality, biotechnology, epidemiology, the use of scien\u00ad tific information in public policy formation and litigation, the health impacts of work environments, and processes involved in environmental regulation. ADMISSION Students should submit their application by January 15 to receive full consideration for fellowship and assistantship awards. The deadline by which the application file must be completed, includ\u00ad ing the application form, transcripts, three letters of recommenda\u00ad tion, and Graduate Record Examination (GRE) scores, is February 1. Additional information is available from the Social Ecology Graduate Counselor; telephone (714) 824-5917, 824-5918. CAREER OPPORTUNITIES Graduates enjoy a wide variety of career opportunities and have succeeded in obtaining positions in academic institutions such as Stanford University; Rutgers University; The Johns Hopkins Uni\u00ad versity; Temple University; University of California, Los Angeles; University of California, San Diego; University of Colorado; Uni\u00ad versity of Kansas; University of the Ore\u00ad gon; the University of Wisconsin; Indiana University; Carnegie Mellon University; and the City University of New York. Other graduates have established research and administrative careers in government agencies and private firms throughout the United States and Canada, including the National Institutes of Health, the Toronto Department of Public Health, The United Cerebral Palsy Foundation, The Philadelphia Geriatric Center, The New Mexico Tumor Registry, Orange County Superior Court, Southern Califor\u00ad nia Metropolitan Water District, and in marketing and research firms such as the Yankelovich Group. Master's Programs M.A. IN SOCIAL ECOLOGY The Master's program offers advanced training that prepares stu\u00ad dents for a variety of positions. Many recent M.A. graduates are now employed in federal, state, county, city, and private agencies in such areas as planning, mental health and welfare, environmen\u00ad tal regulation, and probation and parole. In addition, a number of students with the Master's degree in Social Ecology have entered Ph.D. programs at other universities. Each incoming Master's degree student is assigned a faculty advi\u00ad sor with whom the student discusses an individual program of edu\u00ad cation. The program leading to the M.A. degree requires a thesis UC IRVINE - 1996-1997and satisfactory completion of seven approved courses (28 units), including the Seminar in Social Ecology (Social Ecology 200), Research Methods (Social Ecology 201), and at least one addi\u00ad tional approved course in statistics or methodology. Other courses should be selected with regard to the student's academic and career objectives, and must be approved by the faculty advisor. The seven required courses must include at least five graduate courses and must be exclusive of any directed study, independent study, or the\u00ad sis courses (Social Ecology 298, 299, or 295). A grade of B or bet\u00ad ter must be achieved in all courses. Students are advanced to can\u00ad didacy for the M.A. degree, and a thesis committee is appointed, after a review of their graduate work and thesis plans by a faculty committee. All M.A. students who have been in the M.A. program for three or more years will be formally evaluated by the Social Ecology faculty at the end of each academic year. At that time the faculty may recommend that the student continue toward the M.A. or cease study in the School. One year of academic residence is required, but completion of all M.A. requirements, including a the\u00ad sis approved by the student's committee, ordinarily takes two years. M.S. IN ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH SCIENCE AND POLICY The Master of Science (M.S.) in Environmental Health Science and Policy (EHSP) trains environmental professionals for applied analytical and administrative positions in government, commerce, and the nonprofit sector. In common with the doctoral program in EHSP, training focuses on the integration of natural and social sci\u00ad ence knowledge for the promotion of human health within a sus\u00ad tainable ecosystem. M.S. students must complete a core of five required courses: Environmental Health Science (EHS) I, II, III; Data Analysis, Part A (Social Ecology 264A); and Data Analysis, Part B (Social Ecology 264B) or Ecological Modeling (Social Ecology 252); and three electives. Students must also complete a field study of about six months in duration, resulting in a defended Master's thesis and degree completion within two to three years. MASTER OF URBAN AND REGIONAL PLANNING The Master of Urban and Regional Planning (M.U.R.P.) program seeks to train researchers and professionals in contemporary meth\u00ad ods of planning and policy analysis. Students gain familiarity with planning problems and practices through a series of courses on the growth and development of metropolitan areas, and the environ\u00ad mental, economic, and social challenges that modem communities face. This program views planners as mediators between the mar\u00ad ket-driven forces of metropolitan change and the environmental, economic, and social impacts of such change. Some of the specific planning issues addressed include tne envi\u00ad ronmental, social, health, and economic impacts of urban and regional development; regional growth management; state and municipal fiscal policy; poverty-related concerns; urban design; the operation of housing markets; land-use law and regula\u00ad tion; transportation planning; and planning for urban development in newly industrialized countries. Students are provided not only with a rigorous foundation in the tools that public and private sec\u00ad tor planners use, but also with the intellectual wherewithal to use them effectively in addressing these concerns. Participation in fac\u00ad ulty research is encouraged as part of the program, as are field placements in local planning agencies and private planning and development firms. The range of employment opportunities for professional planners in the public and private sectors is expanding due to rapid metro\u00ad politan growth, rising concerns over health and environmental issues, and the continuing need for redevelopment and social ser\u00ad vices in older communities. Career paths exist in government agen\u00ad cies dealing with urban planning, economic development, trans\u00ad portation planning, regional growth management, air quality and Social Ecology 313 water treatment, public utilities, health care organizations and pub\u00ad lic health agencies, and conservation organizations and agencies. Many employment possibilities also exist with private consulting firms specializing in environmental impact assessment, with resi\u00ad dential and commercial development firms, and many engineering and architectural firms. The program leads to the M.U.R.P. degree- Master of Urban and Regional Planning. Students are required to complete 72 units, dis\u00ad tributed between core and elective courses. In addition, a written comprehensive examination or a professional report is required during the last quarter of residency in the program. A total of four units (two courses) of independent study in preparation for the examination or the professional report also is recommended. Suc\u00ad cessful completion of the examination is required before the degree can be awarded. A thesis is not required. Ph.D. Programs The doctoral programs offered by the School of Social Ecology prepare students for academic careers in research and teaching. Graduates also are well qualified for employment in private or government agencies, where they can bring advanced academic training, strong methodological and statistical skills, and special expertise to such issues as environmental health and design, urban and regional planning, criminal justice, and social policies affect\u00ad ing mental and physical health across the life course. Students who enter with the normal academic preparation and pursue a full-time program of study ordinarily should be able to earn the Ph.D. in four to five years of study beyond the baccalaureate. Each incoming Ph.D. student is assigned a faculty advisor with whom the student should meet at least once every quarter to dis\u00ad cuss an individualized program of graduate education. The follow\u00ad ing core courses are required of all Ph.D. students except those enrolled in the Environmental Health Science and Policy doctoral program and the Urban and Regional Planning doctoral program: Seminar in Social Ecology (Social Ecology 200), Research Meth\u00ad ods (Social Ecology 201), two approved quarters of graduate-level statistics, and one additional approved research methods course. In addition to these five required core courses, doctoral students take additional required and elective courses, as summarized in subsequent sections that describe the individual Ph.D. programs. This additional course work is exclusive of any field study, directed study, independent study, or dissertation-research courses (Social Ecology 297, 298, 299, or 296). School faculty believe that Ph.D. students should become involved in research very early in their graduate careers. To encourage such involvement, doctoral students are required to complete a research project before advancement to candidacy for the Ph.D. degree. The method of research may include experiments, questionnaire and interview studies, systematic field observation, secondary analysis, computer simulations, legal research, and other methods. It is expected that students will begin their project during the first year in residence and will complete it during the second year. The writ\u00ad ten report of the project may be equivalent to a Master's thesis and may be submitted as such if the student's committee approves. Before being officially advanced to candidacy for the Ph.D. degree, doctoral students must demonstrate mastery of a broad base of knowledge within their area of study. This is accomplished through successful completion of either a written comprehensive examination or a breadth requirement (see individual program descriptions for specific requirements). The breadth requirement can be completed by submitting a major paper or series of papers that intensively examine specific substantive problems and bodies of research. Preferably, the perspective taken should be multidisci\u00ad plinary, but a single disciplinary approach is acceptable if it is more congruent with the student's educational goals and is acceptable to UC IRVINE - 1996-1997I 314 UCI 1996-97 School of Social Ecology the student's committee. Each student's plans for completing the breadth requirement are developed in collaboration with a commit\u00ad tee of three Social Ecology faculty members. Students are encour\u00ad aged to meet with this committee as early as possible during their graduate career and are required to do so by no later than the third quarter of their second year. Once the student's plans have been approved and implemented, the examining committee will deter\u00ad mine whether the breadth requirement was successfully completed, and will recommend additional academic work if it is deemed necessary. A student may be formally advanced to candidacy for the Ph.D. degree when all requirements except the dissertation have been completed, and when the student's dissertation plan has been approved by the candidacy committee appointed by the School of Social Ecology, on behalf of the Dean of Graduate Studies and the Graduate Council. The student will appear before this committee for an oral examination. The dissertation plan will include a thor\u00ad ough examination of the history of the problem being proposed for investigation, its current status, the way in which the proposed research will further knowledge, a detailed specification of the pro\u00ad posed method of investigating the problem, and a description of the planned methods for analyzing the data collected. It is strongly recommended that students advance to candidacy during their third year of study. In no case will students be allowed to advance to candidacy after the end of their fifth year of study. Formal advancement to candidacy for the Ph.D. degree will be approved by the Dean of Graduate Studies upon recommendation by a unanimous vote of the student's candi.dacy committee. Alter\u00ad natively, the committee may recommend a course of action to \u00b7 strengthen the student for advancement to candidacy at a future date. When the student is advanced to candidacy, a doctoral com\u00ad mittee will be appointed on behalf of the Graduate Council. The doctoral committee, ordinarily consisting of three members of the faculty, will supervise the preparation and completion of the doc\u00ad toral dissertation. The dissertation should be completed and accepted within one to two years, and no later than three calendar years after the student's advancement to candidacy. All Ph.D. students who have not been advanced to candidacy will be formally evaluated by members of the Social Ecology faculty at the end of each year. At that time, the faculty may recommend that the student continue toward the Ph.D. degree, complete the M.A. degree only, or cease graduate studies in the School. Evaluation of Ph.D. students who have advanced to candidacy is the responsibil\u00ad ity of the student's doctoral dissertation committee. Prior to the award of the Ph.D. degree, each doctoral student must serve as a Teaching Assistant under faculty supervision for at least two quarters. Ph.D. IN SOCIAL ECOLOGY The training program that leads to the Ph.D. in Social Ecology allows students to develop a tailored course of graduate study that draws upon the knowledge of several traditional academic disci\u00ad plines. This is a small distinguished program intended for gen\u00ad uinely interdisciplinary doctoral students. The emphases of this training program are in keeping with the academic mission of the School, namely, its emphases on an ecological approach to research and policy, an interdisciplinary approach to research and community intervention, and the application of theory and research to community problem solving. Students are encouraged to inte\u00ad grate the diverse theoretical and methodological insights of several disciplines in order to analyze important social and environmental problems from a perspective of breadth as well as depth. In doing so, students gain familiarity with the classic and contemporary lit\u00ad erature in social ecology and with the application of the ecological paradigm, as it has evolved in the natural and behavioral sciences. Each incoming student takes the five core courses required of most Ph.D. students, noted above, and six elective courses, chosen in consultation with the faculty advisor. The normative time for com\u00ad pletion of the Ph.D. requirements is four to five years. Students are encouraged to become involved in research in their first year of study by participating in the research projects of the faculty. Stu\u00ad dents complete a supervised research project before they begin work on their doctoral dissertation. Research is broadly construed to include experimental methods, questionnaire and interview stud\u00ad ies, systematic field observation, secondary analyses, and legal analyses. This predissertation research project should be completed during the second year in residence and must be evaluated and approved by a committee of three faculty members. Students com\u00ad plete the breadth requirement, described earlier, during their third year of study. The fourth and possibly fifth years of study are devoted to developing and defending a dissertation proposal and conducting dissertation research. Ph.D. IN SOCIAL ECOLOGY WITH A CONCENTRATION IN ENVIRONMENTAL ANALYSIS AND DESIGN The doctoral concentration in Environmental Analysis and Design prepares students to conduct research on questions of vital impor\u00ad tance to environmental and planning professionals. These questions reflect an overarching concern with the health of humans and the natural environment. Students conduct analyses of sociocultural, behavioral, and environmental factors that influence health and well-being, including public and private sector policy. The curricu\u00ad lum and the diversity of faculty within the concentration afford unique opportunities for multidisciplinary research and training. One of the concentration's strengths is its research methods sequence, which draws from several disciplines and includes sur\u00ad vey and epidemiologic methods, water and air quality testing, facilities programming and postoccupancy evaluation, legal research, and assessment of psychological effects of environmental factors. Potential employment sources for graduates include acade\u00ad mic and research institutions; federal agencies; policy-making organizations; urban and regional planning community, and workplace health-promotion programs; and envi\u00ad ronmental design consulting firms. Each incoming student takes the five core courses required of most Ph.D. students, noted earlier, and eight elective courses drawn from the three focal areas within this concentration: Environmental Design and Behavior, Urban Planning and Design, and Environ\u00ad mental Health and Public Policy. The elective courses cover topics such as environmental and urban design, environmental health risks, urban planning, facilities design and management, behavioral epidemiology, demography, the regulatory process, urban and regional analysis, technological hazards and change, and environ\u00ad mental toxicology. The normative time for completion of the Ph.D. requirements is four to five years. Students are expected to become involved in research activities in their first year of graduate study. Students complete a supervised research project before they begin work on their doctoral dissertation. This predissertation research project should be completed during the second year in residence (preferably by the end of the winter quarter of the second year). The research project must be evaluated and approved by a commit\u00ad tee of three faculty members. Students complete the breadth requirement, described earlier, during their third year of study. The fourth and possibly fifth years of study are devoted to developing and defending a dissertation proposal and conducting dissertation research. UC IRVINE - 1996-1997Ph.D. IN CRIMINOLOGY, LAW AND SOCIETY The study of the criminal, crime, and institutional responses to ille\u00ad gal behavior is the focus of the doctoral program in Criminology, Law and Society. Students examine issues related to the etiology of crime, the impacts of crime on society, and the process of changing criminal behavior. Students also become acquainted with social regulation and the civil justice system, allowing them to address the nature of illegal activities as well as the response of individuals and social systems to those activities. Students gain familiarity with a number of subjects including sen\u00ad tencing; crime ra:tes; selective incapacitation; modes of modifying criminal prediction of offender dangerousness; to incarceration; victi\u00ad mology; white-collar and organized crime; behavior of courts, juries, and regulatory agencies; and interactions among organiza\u00ad tions within the legal system. Students may concentrate on particu\u00ad lar substantive areas of law and society including occupational health and safety, white-collar or economic crime, environmental law, and business-government interactions. In general, students are introduced to the leading classical and contemporary issues in criminology, law and society and to ways of understanding them through interdisciplinary research. The training program aims to develop theoretical sophistication and to prepare the graduate stu\u00ad dent for faculty positions at major universities; and for research and administrative work in institutions in the legal system, the criminal justice system, and related organizations. In addition to the five core courses required of most Ph.D. stu\u00ad dents, noted earlier, students take at least three required courses, Theories of Crime, (C235), Law and Society, (C239), Legal Rea\u00ad soning, (C237), and four elective courses in Criminology, Law and Society. These elective courses should be chosen in consultation with the student's faculty advisor. Students become involved in research activities from the earliest stages of their training and complete an independent, supervised research project during the second year of graduate study. Methods of research may include experiments, questionnaire and survey studies, systematic field observation, computer simulation, and legal analyses. Students complete a written comprehensive examination during year three, which requires them to demonstrate mastery of the principles of social ecology and general knowledge of major theoretical, sub\u00ad stantive, and methodological issues in criminology, law and soci\u00ad ety. The fourth and, possibly, fifth years of study are devoted to developing and defending a dissertation proposal and completing dissertation research. Opportunities for field placements in legal and criminal justice settings also are available. Ph.D. IN ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH SCIENCE AND POLICY Human health and the integrity of the natural environment are interdependent. More now than ever, challenges in public health and the environment must be faced using knowledge both from the social and the natural sciences. The graduate program in Environ\u00ad mental Health Science and Policy (EHSP) is rooted in existing dis\u00ad ciplines, but emphasizes an emerging common base of knowledge that spans both the social and the natural sciences. To optimize flexibility, including options for primary emphasis on laboratory and field work, the curriculum is organized around four concentra\u00ad tions. The concentration in Environmental Biotechnology pro\u00ad vides training in the use of microbial, genetic, or molecular appli\u00ad cations for environmental monitoring, environmental cleanup, and other related purposes. The concentration in Environmental Health Science expands its conventional focus to include ecologi\u00ad cal context. The concentration in Environmental Management and Policy explores the linkages between physical environmental problems and the social institutions that are both their cause and solution. The concentration in Epidemiology and Public Health Social Ecology 315 embeds traditional approaches in these fields within a framework of physical and natural systems. Within each concentration, students are expected to develop inter\u00ad ests in particular substantive problems, for example, those of the core faculty, which include water quality monitoring and bioreme\u00ad diation, toxic metals in the environment (their characterizations, exposure levels, and health effects), international conflict and cooperation in resource management, habitat restoration and con\u00ad servation biology, the demographic foundation of health and well\u00ad being, and the epidemiology of violence and injury-prevention. Students are prepared to become active researchers, able to assume positions in higher education, government, commerce, or the non\u00ad profit sector-wherever environmental quality is of concern. Prior to graduate program admission, students must elect one of the four EHSP concentrations listed above. For all concentrations, students must complete a core of five required courses: Environ\u00ad mental Health Science (EHS) I, II, III; Data Analysis, Part A (Social Ecology 264A); and Data Analysis, Part B (Social Ecology 264B) or Ecological Modeling (Social Ecology 252). In addition, students must complete six approved electives relating to their respective concentrations. Consistent with the program's multidis\u00ad ciplinary nature, elective courses may be drawn not only from within the Department of Environmental Analysis and Design but (with approval) from throughout the School of Social Ecology and the campus (including, for example, the College of Medicine or the School of Engineering). About the end of the second year, students are expected to demonstrate methodological and theoretical compe\u00ad tence in their concentration through successful completion of an oral examination. Approval of a dissertation research plan should occur about the third year en route to degree completion in four or five years. In addition, doctoral students must complete a mini\u00ad mum of three quarters as a teaching assistant. Ph.D. IN HEALTH PSYCHOLOGY Doctoral training in Health Psychology focuses on identifying, evaluating, and enhancing the psychosocial and behavioral factors that promote health, prevent disease, and optimize medical treat\u00ad ments. The training program involves a strong commitment to mul\u00ad tidisciplinary scholarship and a focus on knowledge and theory, research competencies, and professional skills. Students are encouraged to join active investigative teams studying processes such as adaptive aging; stress, coping, and social support; biobe\u00ad havioral mechanisms of cardiovascular reactivity; personality fac\u00ad tors that increase resilience to health threats; the development of heart-healthy behavior patterns during childhood and adolescence; worksite health promotion and the design of work environments; and perceptions of health and environmental risks. In addition, a year-long practicum provides students with research experience in health care settings and exposure to clinical interventions in the field of health psychology. Potential employment sites for gradu\u00ad ates include academic institutions; health care settings; federal workplace, and community health-promotion pro\u00ad grams; research organizations; and university and government pol\u00ad icy institutes. Students take the five core courses required of most Ph.D. students, noted earlier. In addition, students take four required health psychol\u00ad ogy courses, Seminar in Health Psychology (P258), Biobehavioral Aspects of Health and Illness (P273), Human Stress and the Envi\u00ad ronment as Stressor (P267), and the three-quarter Practicum in Psychology (P290A-B-C). Also, students take one health psy\u00ad chology elective, Child Health Psychology (P277), Perceptions of Environmental and Health Risks (E206), Interpersonal Processes and Health (P262), or Psychosocial Dimensions of Chronic Illness (P231 ); and three additional courses, e.g., Late Adulthood and Aging (P225), Environmental Psychology (E288), Violence and Its Social UC IRVINE - 1996-1997I 316 UCI 1996-97 School of Social Ecology Impact (P237). Research on Subjective Well-Being (P248), only one of which can be taken from the Health Psychology cluster. Students are expected to become involved in research activities from the earliest stages of their training and must complete an independent, supervised research project during their second year. Students take a written comprehensive examination during their third year, which requires them to demonstrate mastery of the prin\u00ad ciples of social ecology and major theoretical, substantive, and methodological issues in health psychology. The fourth and possi\u00ad bly fifth years are devoted to developing and defending a disserta\u00ad tion proposal and completing dissertation research. Opportunities for field placements in health-related settings also are available. Students must complete all requirements for the Ph.D. in Health Psychology no later than their eighth year of study, adjusted for any approved leaves of absence that may have been taken. It is expected that most students will complete the degree requirements well in advance of this deadline. Ph.D. IN HUMAN DEVELOPMENT The doctoral program in Human Development focuses on the development of individuals across the life course and the effects of the varying social, physical, and cultural contexts in which devel\u00ad opment takes place. Students are introduced to key developmental theories and concepts, with attention to all phases of the life course; the research methods of several social science specialities; and the conduct of problem-oriented research that is relevant to the improvement of individual and societal functioning. Potential employment sites for graduates include academic institutions (e.g., departments of psychology or human development); research orga\u00ad nizations; human services settings (e.g., hospitals, schools, com\u00ad munity agencies); government policy institutes; and a variety of private sector employers. Students are encouraged to become actively involved in research from the earliest stages of their training. Through close association with faculty members in the Human Development program and participation in their research projects, students learn to use a vari\u00ad ety of research methods and to conduct methodologically sophisti\u00ad cated research that addresses contemporary social issues. Current research teams are investigating the effects of divorce and custody arrangements; the effects of maternal and paternal employment on parents' well-being and child and adolescent outcomes; children's health risk perceptions; the strengths and limitations of children as witnesses; modes of adapting to stress over the life span; and the impact of activity patterns and social ties on the well-being of the elderly. Students take the five core courses required of most Ph.D. stu\u00ad dents, noted earlier. In addition, students take two required human development courses, Principles of Human Development (P220) and Issues in Human Development (P236A-B); and two of five life cycle courses chosen from the following: Infancy (P218), Child\u00ad hood (P234), Adolescence (P204), Adulthood (P230), Late Adult\u00ad hood and Aging (P225). An additional four elective courses are selected from the following six clusters: life span development; foundations of development; social, physical, and cultural contexts of development; health and adjustment over the life span; social problems and policies; and methods and strategies of research. These courses should be chosen according to a plan that best meets the needs of the individual student, as determined in consultation with the student's faculty advisor. In addition to courses offered by the School of Social Ecology, the Human Development curriculum may include courses offered by the Department of Psychobiology in the School of Biological Sciences, the Graduate School of Man\u00ad agement, and the Departments of Anthropology and Sociology in the School of Social Sciences. Students complete an independent, supervised research project dur\u00ad ing their second year. They take a written comprehensive examina\u00ad tion during their third year, which requires them to demonstrate mastery of the principles of social ecology and of major theoreti\u00ad cal, substantive, and methodological issues in the study of human development. The fourth and possibly fifth years are devoted to developing and defending a dissertation proposal and completing dissertation research. Students must complete all requirements for the Ph.D. in Human Development no later than their eighth year of study, adjusted for any approved leaves of absence that may have been taken. It is expected that most students will complete the degree requirements well in advance of this deadline. Ph.D. IN URBAN AND REGIONAL PLANNING The doctoral program in Urban and Regional Planning seeks to train researchers and professionals who will further our under\u00ad standing of how planning and policy-making can best improve the social, economic, and environmental characteristics of our commu\u00ad nities and regions. The curriculum emphasizes the analytic, applied planning, and policy skills required of contemporary planners. Spe\u00ad cializations include community attitudes and social policy, land use and growth management, economics and public policy, transporta\u00ad tion policy, community health planning and policy, and urban design and behavior. UCI's close proximity to both urban centers and planned suburban communities, as well as its location within the dynamic Southern California and Pacific Rim regions, add to the program's appeal. The Ph.D. program in Urban and Regional Planning features course work in planning theory and research methods, and there are substantial choices in elective courses on critical issues in urban and regional planning. A pre-dissertation research project, supervised by a faculty member, is required during the second year. The third year includes preparation for, and completion of a comprehensive examination. Following this, dissertation proposals and research begin. Graduate Courses in Social Ecology 200 Seminar in Social Ecology ( 4).

Yell ott, Jr., Ph.D. Stanford University, Chair of the Department of Cognitive Sciences and Professor of Psychology Moira Yip, Ph.D. Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Faculty Associate to the Dean and Professor of Linguistics OVERVIEW Undergraduate and graduate education in the School of Social Sciences at UCI represents a commitment to modem social science. The classic subject areas of anthropology, economics, geography, linguistics, political science, psychology, and sociology are in\u00ad cluded in the School's educational programs, but these programs go well beyond the traditional disciplines and can be characterized by the following emphases. First, the faculty recognizes the value of systematic empirical observation and quantitative analysis in the study of human behav\u00ad ior. Developments in computer science and in mathematics ori\u00ad ented toward the problems of the social sciences, and the refine\u00ad ment of techniques for the observational, experimental, and statistical study of human behavior, have contributed major new elements to social science. Students in the School of Social Sci\u00ad ences will become familiar with the mathematical, computational, and statistical tools underlying modem social science. Second, many of the most interesting questions in the study of human behavior cannot be fixed within the traditional disciplinary boundaries. Some of the new and evolving areas which cross orthodox boundaries are political sociology, public policy, cogni\u00ad tive anthropology, and psycholinguistics. Therefore many courses and course modules are built around social science phenomena rather than representing social science disciplines. UC IRVINE - 1996-1997I 324 UCI 1996-97 School of Social Sciences Third, the School shares the academic philosophy that considers the design of hypotheses and of systems of interrelated ideas about the possible structure of the world to be an essential part of scien\u00ad tific pursuit. Consequently, the educational programs place sub\u00ad stantial emphasis on understanding social science phenomena through the development of theories that can be used to guide empirical studies. Educational opportunities for students in the School of Social Sciences extend well beyond attendance at courses. Students may develop independent study proposals in cooperation with interested faculty members; they are invited to participate in the quarterly evaluation of courses and instructors, to propose new courses and other modifications in existing programs, to nominate candidates for visiting faculty appointments, and to serve on School commit\u00ad tees. The School provides a variety of opportunities for faculty-stu\u00ad dent interaction, and students will find the faculty, administration, and academic counseling staff of the School highly accessible and responsive. Special Facilities The School of Social Sciences maintains several special facilities for research and education. The Social Sciences Research Labo\u00ad ratory occupies the entire fourth floor of the Social Sciences Lab\u00ad oratory Building. The facility contains 40 experiment and control rooms situated around a central core where two Micro Vax II com\u00ad puter systems are available for experimental research. The labora\u00ad tory is used for both faculty and student research. The Farm School, a small, open, and ungraded elementary school located in a rural setting adjacent to the campus, serves as a research facility for faculty and students having interests in chil\u00ad dren and how they learn. Each quarter undergraduates receive course credit for assisting staff teachers, for developing educational materials, and for observing and analyzing child behavior at the school. The Laboratory of Anthropology is used for research in medical anthropology, quantitative studies, discourse analysis, and artificial intelligence. Facilities include personal computers; computer ter\u00ad minals and software for statistical studies, parallel distributed pro\u00ad cessing, and content analysis. The Social Science Academic Resource Center provides personal assistance to all Social Science students on research opportunities, off-campus internships, and graduate and professional programs. In addition, the Resource Center offers counseling on postbaccalaureate programs, provides Internet access and instruction to students, and disseminates information on scholarships, workshops, and other ser\u00ad vices through a quarterly newsletter, the Social Sciences Hotsheet. Visiting Distinguished Professorships The School of Social Sciences sponsors a program of Visiting Dis\u00ad tinguished Professorships that exposes students to seminal thinkers in the social sciences. The professorships normally are of a quarter's duration. Participants have included Martin Bronfenbrenner, Profes\u00ad sor of Economics at Duke University and Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences; Philip Converse, Robert C. Angell Professor of Political Sciences and Sociology (University of Michi\u00ad gan), President of the American Political Science Association, and member of the National Academy of Sciences and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences; Beatrice Whiting, Professor of Anthropology and Education Emeritus, Graduate School of Educa\u00ad tion (Harvard University), and member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences; John Whiting, Professor of Social Anthropology (Harvard University) and member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences; and James Coleman, Professor of Sociology (Univer\u00ad sity of Chicago) and member of the National Academy of Sciences and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.

Linguistics, supervised by faculty in the Department of Linguistics. Mathematical Behavioral Science, supervised by an interdiscipli\u00ad nary group of faculty. Social Networks, supervised by the faculty in Anthropology and Sociology. Social Relations, supervised by the faculty in Anthropology and Sociology. 1 The degree programs in Comparative Culture are not available at this time; however, multicultural/international courses are offered under Social Science. 2 The major of Geography is not available at this time; however, courses in Geography are offered under Social Science. 3 Supervised by the Interdepartmental Group in Transportation Science. HONORS Honors at graduation, i.e., cum laude, magna cum laude, or summa cum laude, are awarded on the basis of academic performance. Of the graduating seniors, approximately 1 percent will be awarded summa cum laude, 3 percent magna cum laude, and 8 percent cum laude. To be considered for honors, a student must have a mini\u00ad mum of 72 units in residence at a University of California campus. Other important factors are considered (see page 55). Undergraduate Program PLANNING A PROGRAM OF STUDY Since there are many alternative ways to plan a program, some of which may require careful attention to specific major requirements, students should consult with the School of Social Sciences Under\u00ad graduate Counseling Office to design an appropriate program of study. Students who elect one of the School majors in their freshman year might begin by taking the one-digit courses required by their major and one of the mathematics sequence~ listed under Part A of the School requirements. It is a good idea to take these courses early since they include fundamental concepts that will be widely applic\u00ad able in more advanced courses. In addition, the lower-division writing requirement of the breadth requirement (Category I) should be completed during the first year. In the sophomore year, the stu\u00ad dent might complete the course on computing, three courses toward the breadth requirement, four courses in the social sciences, and four electives. Students who are planning to go on to graduate school can use their freshman and sophomore years to advantage by taking courses in theory, research methods, mathematics, and other areas important to graduate study. In the junior and senior years, the student should take courses in the major area and should create an individualized program of study through a combination of courses and course modules which fall in an area of interest. Particular attention should be paid to planning a program of study that will ensure that major requirements are met prior to graduation. UC IRVINE - 1996-1997Double Majors In order to double major within the School of Social Sciences, the following conditions must be met: (I) Neither major program may be the Social Science major. (2) Major and School requirements must be met for both majors with no overlap of courses except for those used to satisfy the mathematics, computer technology, and introductory social science requirements. The mathematics and computer courses need only be taken once. Only two introductory social science classes are needed, provided this also meets the requirements of both major programs. The same two-digit and upper-division courses may not be used to meet the requirements of more than one major program. For example, a student who wishes to major in Psychology and Anthropology may take one of the mathematics sequences, Infor\u00ad mation and Computer Science 1A, IP, or 21, or Social Science 3A, and may use Introduction to Psychology and Introduction to Anthropology to meet the major and School requirements for both programs. However, two different sets of two-digit and upper-divi\u00ad sion courses must be taken to complete the major and School requirements of the two programs. Teaching Credentials The major in Social Science, with the specialization in Social Stud\u00ad ies, is specifically designed for prospective K-12 teachers. Stu\u00ad dents planning to seek State of California teaching credentials in the social sciences should discuss their undergraduate curriculum plans with the School's academic counselors. Mathematics and Social Sciences The mathematics requirement stems from the nature of modem social science. The concepts and terms of mathematics, statistics, and computers are an important part of the social scientist's vocab\u00ad ulary. Basic knowledge of these tools is necessary to an under\u00ad standing of current literature in the social sciences, to the analysis of data, and to an intelligent use of social science models. Each candidate for a degree in the School of Social Sciences is expected to have a basic knowledge of probability, statistics, and computing. In addition, for students who are preparing for graduate school in an area of social science, it will be important to supplement the minimal mathematics requirements with additional courses related to mathematics and social science methodology. The particular courses which would be recommended are not specified here, how\u00ad ever, since they are highly dependent on the major emphasis of the student. Students who are preparing for graduate study should con\u00ad sult their advisors to determine a program of study which will give them the research skills necessary for successful graduate work. REQUIREMENTS FOR THE BACHELOR'S DEGREE University Requirements:' See pages 57-61. School Requirements A. Familiarity with basic mathematical, computational, and statis\u00ad tical tools underlying modem social sciences. This requirement is met by passing a three-course sequence in mathematics Sociology lOA-B-C). Computer education is essen\u00ad tial for a complete social science education. This requirement can be satisfied by passing Information and Computer Science lA, lP, or 21, or Social Science 3A. Departments may have preferences for specific courses; see your major department for acceptable courses. These courses normally should be taken during the student's first year. B. An understanding of the fundamental concepts, analytical tools, and methods of social science. This requirement is met by taking two introductory courses in the School of Social Sciences bearing Social Sciences 325 a one-digit course number. These courses normally should be taken during the student's first year. C. An understanding of important advanced areas in social sci\u00ad ence. This requirement is met by passing satisfactorily nine upper\u00ad division courses in the School of Social Sciences, where at least three of these courses comprise a module. For modules which are listed with more than three courses, the student may normally elect to take any subset of three courses in the module. Appropriate sub\u00ad stitutions may be made upon petition. D. Four additional social science courses from any level. Students are reminded that the Pass/Not Pass option is not applic\u00ad able to course requirements A through D above or to any addi\u00ad tional requirements listed for specific major programs. However, Information and Computer Science 1A, 21, and Social Sciences lOOA are exceptions to this rule and may be taken Pass/Not Pass. Courses used to meet requirements B through D above are included in the computation of the grade point average in courses required in the major program. TRANSFER STUDENTS Freshmen and Sophomores: Students transferring to UCI as freshmen or sophomores will fulfill the regular requirements of the four-year program either through work at UCI or through transfer credit for comparable work elsewhere. Juniors: Following review by the School of Social Sciences, it may be determined that junior transfer students electing to major in one of the School's degree programs, who have good records at other accredited colleges and universities, have satisfied School requirement B and the University requirements. However, all trans\u00ad fer students must fulfill the upper-division writing breadth require\u00ad ment (category I) while at UCI. Students anticipating transfer to UCI in their junior year should plan their curriculum so as to antic\u00ad ipate the special mathematics requirement (School requirement A). Every effort will be made to accommodate individual variation in background, provided students are prepared to commit themselves to intensive work in areas of deficiency. Ordinarily, the typical two-year program for junior transfers is simply the last two years of the regular four-year program, except that students who have not satisfied the mathematics requirements of the School should plan to do so in the junior year and must do so before graduation. Seniors: Students wishing to graduate with a degree in the School by transferring to UCI in their senior year should plan their work carefully to ensure that the requirements can be met in one year of residence. In general, differences between the program at UCI and programs elsewhere make senior transfers difficult. SPECIAL PROGRAMS 3-2 Program with the Graduate School of Management Outstanding students who are interested in a career in management may wish to apply for entry into the Graduate School of Manage\u00ad ment's 3-2 Program. Students normally apply for this program early in their junior year. See the Graduate School of Management section for additional information. Education Abroad Program Upper-division students have the opportunity to experience a dif\u00ad ferent culture while making progress toward degree objectives through the Education Abroad Program (EAP). EAP is an overseas study program which operates in cooperation with host universities and colleges throughout the world. Additional information is avail\u00ad able in the Center for International Education section. UC IRVINE - 1996-1997I 326 UCI 1996-97 School of Social Sciences Interdisciplinary Minors A variety of interdisciplinary minors are available to all UCI students. A brief description of each program follows; detailed information is included in the Interdisciplinary Studies section of the Catalogue. The minor in African-American Studies is an interdisciplinary program which offers undergraduate students an opportunity to study those societies and cultures established by the people of the African diaspora and to investigate the African-American experi\u00ad ence from a variety of disciplinary perspectives and theoretical approaches. The minor in Asian American Studies is an interdisciplinary cur\u00ad riculum which examines the historical and contemporary experi\u00ad ences of Asians after their arrival in the United States and seeks to provide an awareness of the history, culture (e.g., literary and cre\u00ad ative art accomplishments), psychology, and social organization of Asian American communities. The minor in Chicano/Latino Studies is an interdisciplinary cur\u00ad riculum designed to provide an awareness, knowledge, and appre\u00ad ciation of the language, history, culture, literature, sociology, anthropology, politics, social ecology, health, medicine, and cre\u00ad ative (art, dance, film, drama, music) accomplishments in the Chi\u00ad cano/ Latino communities. The minor in Global Peace and Conflict Studies is an interdisci\u00ad plinary curriculum which addresses the problem of international vio\u00ad lence; the threat of global war; and paths to world-wide cooperation in building a secure, prosperous, and democratic future. The minor in Global Sustainability trains students to understand the changes that need to be made in order for the human population to live in a sustainable relationship with the resources available on this planet. The minor in the History and Philosophy of Science explores how science is actually done and how it has influenced history, and is concerned with determining what science and mathematics are, accounting for their apparent successes, and resolving problems of philosophical interest that arise in the sciences. The minor in Latin American Studies is an interdisciplinary cur\u00ad riculum designed to develop in students an awareness, knowledge, and appreciation of Latin American issues in the areas of language, history, culture, literary studies, sociology, anthropology, political science, health, folk medicine, and creative (art, dance, film, drama, music) accomplishments. The minor in Native American Studies focuses on history, culture, religion, and the environment. The three core courses serve as an introduction to the Native American experience from the perspective of different historical periods and frameworks of analysis. The minor in Religious Studies focuses on the comparative study of religions in various cultural settings around the world and seeks to provide a wide-ranging academic understanding and knowledge of the religious experience in society. The minor in Women's Studies offers a curriculum drawing from the humanities, social sciences, and the arts to examine contributions of women from different backgrounds to culture and society and to explore women's and men's lives in the context of changing gender relations. CAREERS IN SOCIAL SCIENCES Graduates of the School of Social Sciences find many and diverse career opportunities. Social Sciences graduates have been in demand for jobs in government, primary and secondary teaching, and human services, as well as for careers in business. Social Sci\u00ad ences graduates have gone on to further studies, some at the doc\u00ad toral level in preparation for careers in research and university teaching, others in the professions of law and medicine, in educa\u00ad tion, and in business administration. Because all Social Sciences degrees \u00b7involve an educational pro\u00ad gram that is interdisciplinary and that prepares students to under\u00ad stand quantitative methods of data analysis, graduates of the School are well-positioned for research and analysis careers at all levels of government and in private firms. Their solid grounding in contemporary social science methods and their familiarity with a broad spectrum of social scientific thinking gives them an excel\u00ad lent foundation for the pursuit of further training in graduate and professional programs. The Career and Life Planning Center provides services to UCI stu\u00ad dents and alumni including career counseling, information about job opportunities, a career library, and workshops on resume preparation, job search, and interview techniques. Additional infor\u00ad mation is available in the Career and Life Planning Center section. Graduate Program The School of Social Sciences offers graduate training in the fol\u00ad lowing areas: Anthropology, leading to the Ph.D. in Social Science; Cognitive Sciences, leading to the Ph.D. in Psychology; Econom\u00ad ics, leading to the Ph.D. in Economics; Linguistics, leading to the Ph.D. in Social Science; Mathematical Behavioral Science, leading to the Ph.D. in Social Science; Politics and Society, leading to the Ph.D. in Political Science; Social Networks, leading to the Ph.D. in Social Science; and Social Relations, leading to the Ph.D. in Social Science. In addition, an interdisciplinary concentration in Public Choice is offered within the programs in Economics and Political Science, a specialized concentration in Transportation Economics is offered within the program in Economics, and a concentration in Political Psychology is offered within the program in Political Sci\u00ad ence. When an applicant's interests lie outside of or across these areas, the Associate Dean of Graduate Studies, School of Social Sciences, may, on rare occasions, appoint a three-member faculty committee to guide an independent course of study leading to the Ph.D. degree in Social Science. Although the School does not admit students for a Master of Arts degree, the M.A. degree in Economics or Social Science may be conferred upon students in progress toward the Ph.D. degree. A graduate program leading to the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in Transportation Science is supervised by an interdepartmental fac\u00ad ulty group. Information is available in the Interdisciplinary Studies section of the Catalogue. The graduate program in Comparative Culture is not available to new students at this time. ADMISSION Potential graduate students should apply by January 15 to receive fullest consideration for financial aid. Applicants should indicate the title of the degree sought (Economics, Political Science, Psy\u00ad chology, or Social Science), and the academic area of concentra\u00ad tion (see above). All applicants are required to submit Graduate Record Examination General Test scores. Letters of recommenda\u00ad tion and the applicant's statement of interest are important factors in the admission decision. In addition to the University admission requirements described in the Research and Graduate Studies section, individual graduate programs may prescribe special requirements or expectations of applicants, subject to the approval of the Graduate Council. Such requirements are minimum standards only; successful applicants typically must exceed them by a substantial margin. UC IRVINE - 1996-1997FINANCIAL SUPPORT Many students receive financial support in the form of~ellowships, teaching assistantships, or research assistantships available under grants to individual faculty. Before accepting an offer of admission with financial support for the first year, applicants should inquire about the likelihood of such support in future years. Occasionally, a newly admitted student may receive a multiyear commitment of some specified financial support, but this is not the rule. Students are also advised to seek aid from sources external to the Univer\u00ad sity. (NOTE: Teaching assistantships do not include remission of fees or nonresident tuition.) LENGTH OF STUDY AND RESIDENCE Students who enter with normal academic preparation should be able to earn the Ph.D. within four to five years, or in the case of Anthropology, six years. Because the intellectual training offered by the School requires full-time study and constant contact with the faculty, the School does not accept part-time students. DEPARTMENT OF ANTHROPOLOGY 4223 Social Sciences II; (714) 824-7602 Leo R. Chavez, Department Chair Anthropology is the comparative study of past and contemporary human societies and cultures. The Department of Anthropology emphasizes contemporary theory in social and cultural anthropol\u00ad ogy, the anthropological tradition of field research, and formal methods for collecting and analyzing anthropological data. The Department has a strong interdisciplinary bent, with research and teaching interests in psychological anthropology, economic anthro\u00ad pology, social history and social change, culture and health, and social structure. Undergraduate Program REQUIREMENTS FOR THE BACHELOR'S DEGREE University Requirements: See pages 57-61. School Requirements: See page 325. Departmental Requirements for the Major School requirements must be met and must include 10 courses (40 units) as specified below: A. Anthropology 2A. B. Anthropology 2B, 2C, or 2D. C. Three courses (12 units), no more than one course from any of the following topical areas in anthropology: (1) Kinship and Social Structure (Anthropology 121A, 121B, 1210, 121G, 121H) 125M, 125P-Q, 125X, 132A, 132B, 134A, 134D, 134E) 136K, 136M) D. Two courses (eight units) on a geographical area, selected from courses in the Area Studies module (Anthropology 160-169). E. Three additional anthropology courses (12 units) selected from those numbered Anthropology 40-180 or Social Science 70C. Anthropology 327 Students are strongly encouraged to take Anthropology 71A early in their studies and Anthropology 180A after they have had at least three courses beyond Anthropology 2A, 2B, 2C, or 2D. The faculty encourages Anthropology majors or minors to study abroad and experience a different culture while making progress toward degree obje<;tives. The Center for International Education, which includes the Education Abroad Program (EAP) and the Inter\u00ad national Opportunities Program (lOP), assists students in taking advantage of many worldwide opportunities. For example, EAP offers excellent opportunities to study anthropology at many univer\u00ad sities abroad and courses taken for departmental requirement C, D, and E would be excellent choices to take. Study abroad also can pro\u00ad vide opportunities for cross-cultural experience, field research, and foreign language training. See the Center for International Education section of the Catalogue for additional information. Honors Program in Anthropology The Honors Program in Anthropology is designed to allow under\u00ad graduates to pursue field research and write an honors thesis on topics of their choice under the guidance of Department of Anthro\u00ad pology faculty members. Research projects typically involve a combination of library research, exploratory ethnographic inter\u00ad views, participant observation, and systematic data collection and analysis. The program is open to all senior Anthropology majors with a grade point average of 3.3 or better overall, with 3.5 in Anthropology courses (at least five courses). Successful comple\u00ad tion of the Honors Program and the honors thesis satisfies the upper-division writing requirement. Although course work for the Honors Program does not start until the senior year, it is highly recommended that during the spring quarter of the junior year, students find a professor willing to serve as their research project advisor on the basis of a mutually acceptable abstract that indicates the goal and significance of their project. If extensive research is to be undertaken at this time, stu\u00ad dents enroll in Anthropology 199. During the fall quarter of the senior year, students enroll in Anthro\u00ad pology H190A and write a proposal describing their research ques\u00ad tion, the relevant background literature, and the method of data collection and analysis. Field work for the project may begin dur\u00ad ing this quarter. In the winter quarter of the senior year, students begin or continue enthnographic field research by enrolling in Anthropology Hl90B. Field research typically combines exploratory field research with fixed format data collection methods. In the spring of the senior year, students enroll in Anthropology H191 and complete a senior honor thesis that is typically 40 to 80 pages long. Honor theses are read and evaluated by the advisor and a second faculty member chosen by the chair of the undergraduate committee in consultation with the advisor. Anthropology Minor Requirements Requirements for the minor in Anthropology are met by taking eight anthropology courses (32 units) as specified below: A. Anthropology 2A. B. Anthropology 2B, 2C, or 2D. C. Three courses (12 units), no more than one from any of the fol\u00ad lowing topical areas in anthropology: (I) Kinship and Social Structure (Anthropology 121A, 121B, 1210, 121G, 121H) 125M, 125P-Q, 125X, 134D, 134E) UC IRVINE - 1996-1997I 328 UCI 1996-97 School of Social Sciences (4) Religion (Anthropology 135A, 135H, 138M, 136K, 136M) D. One course (four units) on a geographical area, selected from courses in the Area Studies module (Anthropelogy 160-169). E.

The program focuses on social and cultural anthropology, with emphases in political economy and economic anthropology, cogni\u00ad tive anthropology, ethnography, and medical anthropology, and has multiple faculty interested in ethnicity, gender, historical anthro\u00ad pology, international migration, and social networks. The program also provides rigorous methodological training, with special strengths in quantitative and formal analysis and in the methodol\u00ad ogy of ethnographic fieldwork. The Department is committed to exploring new and innovative approaches to culture and society in a pluralistic and intellectually open academic environment. Pro\u00ad gram faculty take diverse theoretical and methodological approaches to a variety of substantive issues. They are united, however, in a willingness to question taken-for-granted theoretical premises and analytic frames, and to engage in good-faith intellec\u00ad tual dialogue about alternative models and approaches. ADMISSION Students are admitted to the concentration based on their applica\u00ad tion materials and evidence of scholarly potential, including grade point average, GRE scores, and letters of recommendation. REQUIREMENTS Students must complete a one-year Proseminar in Anthropology during their first year and one course in Anthropological Fieldwork during their second year. In addition, students are required to com\u00ad plete two quarters of Statistics, one course in Research Design, and six elective courses in Anthropology, which are selected in consul\u00ad tation with their advisor and which normally cover a coherent area of specialization within the field. All course work must be com\u00ad pleted before a student is advanced to candidacy. At the end of the first year, students must pass a formal evaluation which is made by the Department of the basis of (1) the first-year course work and (2) examinations to be taken as part of the Pros- . eminar. Students should advance to candidacy by the end of the third year; the advancement to candidacy examination is based on a research proposal, a review of relevant literature, and an anno\u00ad tated bibliography. The fourth (and, in many cases, some or all of the fifth) year is normally devoted to extended anthropological fieldwork. The sixth year (in some cases, also part of the fifth) is devoted to writing the dissertation, in close consultation with the advisor. Social Networks and Social Relations The Department of Anthropology administers two additional grad\u00ad uate programs, Social Networks and Social Relations, in conjunc\u00ad tion with the Department of Sociology; see pages 364-365.

The main areas of research strength within the Department are visual and auditory perception, experimental psychology, and mathemati\u00ad cal psychology. Undergraduate Program Students should be aware that psychology courses are offered in several different departments and programs. Students interested in general psychology including the areas of development, clinical, perception, learning, memory, and cognitive processes are advised to consult the course listings here in the Department of Cognitive Sciences section. These courses are designed to provide students with a strong foundation in general psychology. Students interested in other areas of psychology are advised to consult the course list\u00ad ings in the School of Social Ecology section. In anticipation that the number of students who are qualified to elect Psychology as a major will exceed the number of positions available, students applying for admission for fall 1997 should be sure to file their application before November 30, 1996. Continuing-Student Applicants: Students who were not admitted to the Psychology major upon their admission to the University may apply for entry into the major during the first five weeks of any quarter after their freshman year. Applications must be filed in the School of Social Sciences Undergraduate Counseling Office. To be considered for admission into the Psychology major, stu\u00ad dents must have completed the following: (a) the lower-division writing requirement and (b) the requirements of two additional campus breadth categories. Students applying to the major should have an overall grade point average of at least 2.7. NOTE: Accep\u00ad tance into the major is not guaranteed. In the event that more appli\u00ad cations are received than can be accommodated, applicants may be subject to screening beyond these minimum criteria. Excellence in Psychological Research: Psychology majors doing independent research under Psychology 199 may be eligible for participation in the Excellence in Psychological Research program. Participants have the opportunity to present their research papers published in a peer-reviewed student journal. Guidelines for the program are available from the Department of Cognitive Sciences office. UC IRVINE - 1996-1997REQUIREMENTS FOR THE BACHELOR'S DEGREE University Requirements: See pages 57-61.

Most psychology graduate programs require statistics (which, at UCI, may be satis\u00ad fied by taking Social Sciences IOA-B-C, Psychololgy IOA-B-C, or Social Sciences IOOA-B-C), but some require calculus (which, at UCI, may be satisfied by taking Mathematics 2A-B-C). Honors Program in Psychology The two-year honors program in Psychology is open to selected juniors who are majoring in Psychology. It provides basic training in research methods and culminates with the opportunity for basic research in some area of psychology under faculty supervision. The program has a limited number of openings and seeks to attract outstanding students who plan to undertake postgraduate education in some field of the psychological sciences. Admission to the pro\u00ad gram is based on a formal application that is normally submitted in the spring quarter of the sophomore year. Applicants should have an overall grade point average of at least 3.2 and a grade point average of at least 3.5 in psychology courses, although this requirement may be waived in unusual cases. Cognitive Sciences 333 During the junior year, students who participate in the program are expected to enroll in Honors Experimental Psychology (H111A-B\u00ad C), and in the fall quarter of the Honors Seminar in Psychology (H101A). As seniors, following successful completion of these junior-year requirements, Psychology honors students are enrolled in the Honors Seminar in Psychology (H101B-C) in the winter and spring quarters. Participants in the honors program are expected to complete course work beyond the breadth requirement in one or more of the following areas: biological sciences, mathematics, computer science, physical science, linguistics, philosophy. The honors seminar may be used to satisfy two of the courses required by Part E of the Psychology major requirements. To graduate with Honors in Psychology, a student must successfully complete the requirements for the B.A. degree in Psychology with an overall grade point average of 3.2 and a grade point average of at least 3.5 in Psychology courses.

Yellott, Jr.: Mathematical psychology and visual perception UC IRVINE - 1996-1997334 UCI 1996-97 School of Social Sciences The Department of Cognitive Sciences offers a program of study leading to the Ph.D. in Psychology. The faculty are interested in human cognition, perception, cognitive psychology, and psycholin\u00ad guistics. They lay special stress on precise scientific approaches to issues in human cognition, and view formal models as instrumental in understanding the nature of the human mind. Research interests include: mathematical psychology, perception (visual and auditory), cognitive development, problem solving, artificial intelligence, learning, memory, psycholinguistics, semi\u00ad otics, and theoretical linguistics. The graduate program does not emphasize traditional training in psychology; rather, it stresses the integration of research in the areas mentioned above, and in related areas, into a discipline whose central focus is the study of human knowledge and human information processing, regardless of the medium in which it is expressed. ADMISSION In addition to meeting the general requirements for admission, applicants should have acquired a background in mathematics equivalent to at least one year of calculus. Advanced courses in some of the following fields are considered highly desirable: com\u00ad puter science, mathematics and the physical sciences, biology, logic, and linguistics. Each admission application will be considered on its own merits. REQUIREMENTS Each student is expected to take two three-course graduate sequences. The first is a three-quarter methods sequence covering the areas of probability, statistics, and experimental design (Psy\u00ad chology 203A, 203B, 203C). The other is a proseminar sequence covering areas such as learning, memory, perception, and linguis\u00ad tics (Psychology 202A-B-C). Suitable substitutes may be made with written approval of the Department's Director of Graduate Studies. Additional advanced course work in other fields relevant to the student's interests will supplement the required courses. Knowledge of one foreign language appropriate to the student's research concerns is required. Students are expected to enroll in the Cognitive Sciences Research Seminar (Psychology 201A-B-C) during all quarters in residence prior to advancement to candidacy. In addition, students must take at least six more courses prior to advancement to candidacy. These courses must be taken from at least three of the following five modules: Foundations (Psychology 200-209); Human Cognition (Psychology 210-229); Human (Psy\u00ad chology 250-269); and Sensation and Perception (Psychology 270-289). Each student is expected to carry out theoretical/empirical research during the first two years. By the end of the second year, each stu\u00ad dent should have completed a research project of a scope and nature that is potentially publishable in a relevant journal. The stu\u00ad dent's advisor is responsible for assisting in the planning and other facets of the project. Students are expected to write a paper based on their research and to present a talk to the \"Cognitive Sciences Seminar\" or another appropriate forum by the end of the spring quarter of their second full year in the graduate program. Reviews At the end of each academic year the faculty of the Department will meet to discuss the progress of each of its students and to pro\u00ad vide feedback on the progress and perceived deficiencies of each student. The advancement-to-candidacy examination will consist of an oral examination and, at the faculty's option, a written examination as well. Normally this step will be completed by the end of the third or beginning of the fourth year of the program. The examination will be based on the student's dissertation proposal. Prior to submission of the final version of the dissertation the student will be expected to defend the dissertation in a public colloquium.

DEPARTMENT OF ECONOMICS 3223 Social Sciences II; (714) 824-5788 Amihai Glazer, Department Chair Economics is concerned with the way individuals or societies allo\u00ad cate scarce resources and distribute goods and services. Any situa\u00ad tion requiring choice among competing alternatives can be viewed as an economic problem. Economics courses enable students to study the way individuals make these choices (microeconomics), the way governments make these choices (public choice), and the aggregate consequences of these choices (macroeconomics). In addition, the economics curriculum addresses international trade, money and banking, and economic development of the less devel\u00ad oped nations. The Department of Economics is composed of faculty with inter\u00ad ests in a broad range of areas within micro-and macroeconomics, and the evaluation of public policy. It is especially strong in applied econometrics, public choice, and applied microeconomics including transportation, energy, industrial organization, labor, and urban development. Members of the Department maintain close ties with members of the Department of Politics and Society and the Graduate School of Management. Undergraduate Program In anticipation that the number of students who want to major in Economics will exceed the number of positions available, students applying for admission for fail 1997 should be sure to file their application before November 30, 1996. In the event the major in Economics receives more qualified appli\u00ad cants than can be accommodated, applicants may be subject to screening beyond minimum University of California admissions requirements. Freshman applicants not selected for Economics at the time of admission will be encouraged to opt for the Undeclared major within the School of Social Sciences or for any other open major for which they qualify. However, lower-division courses pre\u00ad requisite to upper-division major study are available to all students, and selection to the Economics major at the end of the sophomore year will be based on performance in those courses. Continuing-Student Applicants. Sophomore students who were not admitted to the Economics major upon their admission to the University may apply for entry into the major. Such students should apply in the School of Social Sciences Undergraduate Counseling Office. The following three criteria must be met to be considered for admission as a junior: the student must have (a) completed two quarters of calculus (Mathematics 2A-B) with a minimum grade of B, (b) completed the basic economic theory sequence (Economics 20A-B-C) with a minimum grade of a Bin at least two of the three quarters, and (c) must have completed the lower-division writing requirement. UC IRVINE - 1996-1997Transfer-Student Applicants: See page 44. REQUIREMENTS FOR THE BACHELOR'S DEGREE University Requirements: See pages 57-61. School Requirements: See page 325. Departmental Requirements for the Major School requirements must be met and must include 15 courses (60 units) as specified below: A. Economics 20A-B-C; this course is a prerequisite for almost all upper-division economics courses. B. All majors must demonstrate competence in probability and statistics prior to enrolling in any upper-division economics course, or they must be concurrently enrolled in an approved probability and statistics course. Students may satisfy this requirement by completing Economics lOA-B-C or an equiva\u00ad lent course. C. All majors must demonstrate competence in calculus by com\u00ad pleting Mathematics 2A-B or equivalent courses. Students must complete at least Mathematics 2A or an equivalent course prior to enrolling in Economics 1 OOA. D.Economics lOOA-B-C. E. Four additional four-unit upper-division economics courses.

Uhlaner: Comparative political participation, formal models of polit\u00ad ical behavior The Department of Economics offers a program of study leading to the Ph.D. in Economics. Drawing upon the School's strong quanti\u00ad tative tradition, it specializes in public choice, transportation eco\u00ad nomics, urban economics, econometrics, and applied microeco\u00ad nomics. Admission is highly selective and is limited to students whose interests mesh closely with those of the faculty. By requir\u00ad ing a high degree of overlap between faculty and student research interests, the program offers extensive faculty contact within a tutorial framework. Motivated and well-qualified students find the graduate program highly attractive because of its small size and its great flexibility. Self-discipline and an inquiring mind are prerequisites. ADMISSION The deadline for application for admission is January 15 for fall quarter. Students are admitted for winter or spring quarters only under exceptional circumstances. Late applications are considered on a space-available basis. All applicants must take the Graduate Record Exam (GRE) prior to the application deadline. Foreign applicants must also submit Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL) scores. REQUIREMENTS All students must show competence in microeconomic theory, macroeconomics, and econometrics. Normally this is done by tak\u00ad ing a three-course sequence in each of these areas. Students also must master two fields of applied economics by taking a two\u00ad course sequence (possibly including independent reading courses) and writing a research paper in each field. Students also must enroll for at least four quarters in the graduate colloquium, in which attendance at regular Economics faculty research colloquia is supplemented by discussion of the papers presented and addi\u00ad tional reading. Students are encouraged to become conversant with areas of current economic research early in their graduate careers, in order to facilitate a timely transition from meeting course and field requirements to thinking through a dissertation research plan. Knowledge of one foreign language is required; a computer lan\u00ad guage may be substituted at the discretion of the faculty. After meeting the above requirements, the student will be advanced to candidacy upon completion of an oral examination on a written dissertation proposal. UC IRVINE - 1996-1997340 UCI 1996-97 School of Social Sciences Concentration in Transportation Economics Students can also be awarded a Ph.D. in Economics with a concen\u00ad tration in Transportation Economics. This option draws upon the transportation researchers on the campus, both within the School of Social Sciences, the School of Engineering, the Graduate School of Management, and the School of Social Ecology. Students benefit from association with the Institute of Transportation Studies. It facilitates student research by providing research assistantships and interdisciplinary seminars on all modes of transportation. Requirements for the concentration are the same as those described above with the following three exceptions: (1) instead of the third quarter of microeconomic and macroeconomic theory, students may substitute specified courses such as Discrete Choice Econo\u00ad metrics (Economics 223A), Advanced Travel Demand Analysis (Engineering CE220A), or Operations Research for Management (Management 201B); (2) one of the student's two required fields of competence must be transportation economics; the other must be a related field such as urban economics, labor economics, industrial organization, or a transportation-related field from outside econom\u00ad ics (such as travel demand and flow theory, urban and transporta\u00ad tion policy analysis, environmental impacts of transportation, or urban and transportation planning) subject to the approval of the Director of Graduate Studies for Economics; and (3) students must take at least one additional course from a list of designated courses in transportation and related subject areas. Concentration in Public Choice Students can also earn a Ph.D. degree in Economics with a concen\u00ad tration in Public Choice. This is an interdisciplinary field, at the intersection of Economics and Political Science, which draws on quantitative tools to model the functioning of political institutions. Faculty from the Departments of Economics, Politics and Society, and Philosophy and from the Graduate School of Management are involved in research that supports the concentration. Students who elect this concentration are admitted under the nor\u00ad mal procedures for the program in Economics and must fulfill all the requirements for the Economics degree with the following modifications: (l) one of the student's two required fields of com\u00ad petence must be public choice; included is a three-quarter core course in public choice, which is jointly organized by faculty in the Department of Economics and the Department of Politics and Soci\u00ad ety. (A background in economic theory equivalent to Economics HlOOA-B-C, Honors Intermediate Economic Theory, is a prerequi\u00ad site to this sequence.) The requirement for competence in a second field may be met with a one-quarter course, instead of two, if it provides sufficient fluency in the field; and (2) students must obtain a background knowledge in political science equivalent to that provided by a one-year undergraduate survey course, if they do not already have it. RESEARCH FACILITIES UCI is a major research university and has an excellent library with a collection of more than 1.5 million volumes, as well as spe\u00ad cial interlibrary loan arrangements with other University of Cali\u00ad fornia libraries. The School of Social Sciences provides a computer laboratory. The Economics Department has a small library with current journals and unpublished working papers from other uni\u00ad versities. Students also have access to several campus computers including a Convex C240 mini-super computer. Three Organized Research Units, the Institute of Transportation Studies, the Center for Research on Information Technology and Organizations, and the Institute for Mathematical Behavioral Sciences, provide research opportunities for graduate students.

James Huang, Department Chair Language is one of the most fundamental human instincts. It is an extraordinarily intricate system that all of us master as young chil\u00ad dren without special teaching, and that gives us the ability to com\u00ad municate, tell stories, and express our deepest feelings. Linguistics is the scientific study of this human language. It is concerned with \u00b7understanding the nature of langmige and our knowledge of it, how we acquire it, and how that knowledge is put to use. It is connected to many other fields of study, including psychology, anthropology, sociology, biology, physics, mathematics, computer science, philos\u00ad ophy, and literature. Undergraduate Program REQUIREMENTS FOR THE BACHELOR'S DEGREE University Requirements: See pages 57-61. School Requirements: See page 325. Departmental Requirements for the Major School requirements must be met and must include 14-15 courses (56-63 units) as specified below: A. Six core courses: Linguistics 3, 10, 20, 100, 111, and 121. B. Six linguistics courses, at least four of which must be upper\u00ad division. One of these four upper-division courses must be 112, 122, or 143. C. NaturaUFormallanguage requirement. One of the following three groups of courses: ( 1) Three courses in a single language other than English, or equivalent. Courses taken to satisfy breadth requirement cat\u00ad egory VI do not qualify. (2) Two linguistics courses on the structure of foreign languages (e.g., Linguistics 165A, 165B, 165C, 166A, and as the topics might apply, 160 and 164A). (3)Two courses in logic (from the Philosophy series 30A-B or 105A-B-C) or computation (from the Information and Com\u00ad puter Science series 21-22). Residence Requirement for the Linguistics Major: At least five upper-division courses required for the major must be completed successfully at UCI. Honors Program in Linguistics The Honors Program in Linguistics is designed for selected junior and senior Linguistics majors who have shown interest in moving beyond the material covered in the regular undergraduate program and demonstrated their readiness for more advanced work than is usually expected at the undergraduate level. An overall grade point average of 3.0 with 3.5 in Linguistics courses is required. Participating students design their program in consultation with the faculty and complete a specified set of courses, culminating in the production and oral defense of a senior thesis. Successful comple\u00ad tion of the Honors Program satisfies the upper-division writing requirement. Four one-quarter courses are required, including Linguistics Hl95 (Honors Research Workshop) and Hl90 (Senior Thesis). Students also select one or two courses from Linguistics 114, 119, 124, 129, 139, 149, 159, and Hl92. Students also may choose to take either Linguistics 198 or 199. Each of these courses will normally require a term paper, and satisfactory completion of these papers with a grade of A-or better is required for Honors students. These term papers usually are closely connected to the senior thesis topic and contribute to its final form. Two of the courses taken toward fulfilling the Honors Program requirements will also count toward the requirements for the major in Linguistics. Linguistics Minor Requirements Requirements for the minor in Linguistics are met by taking seven linguistics courses (28 units) as specified below: A. Linguistics 3, 10, and 20. B. Four additional linguistics courses, three of which must be upper-division. Residence Requirement: At least three upper-division courses required for the minor must be completed successfully at UCI.

Mann: W.C. Watt: Cognitive semiotics The doctoral concentration in Linguistics, administered by a group of faculty specializing in the field, is focused on theoretical lin\u00ad guistics and its role in the cognitive sciences. The research empha\u00ad sis is directed towards the core areas of theoretical work in syntax, semantics, phonology, and psycholinguistics with a concentration on the formal analysis of natural language. Additional emphasis is on the study of a broad range of languages and language families, including East Asian and Romance. Students are further expected to gain expertise in other areas of the cognitive sciences, especially as this pertains to the study of language. The program leads to a Ph.D. in Social Sciences with a concentra\u00ad tion in Linguistics. ADMISSION While at least some undergraduate training in theoretical linguis\u00ad tics is desirable, applications are also welcomed from students with backgrounds in other areas, e.g., philosophy, psychology, language studies, computer science. Decisions on admissions are based on students' undergraduate performance, letters of recommendation, statement of purpose, and any written research materials submitted by the candidate. Applicants must submit Graduate Record Exami\u00ad nation (ORE) scores; applicants from non-English speaking nations must also submit Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL) scores. REQUIREMENTS Course requirements consist of eight core courses (Phonology I, II, III; Syntax I, II, III; and Semantics I, II), four additional Linguistics courses, a proseminar in Cognitive Sciences or an appropriate sub\u00ad stitute, research seminars, and a research workshop. The minor area requirement can be met with two courses in a single minor area (e.g., cognitive sciences, computational linguistics, philosophy) or a UC IRVINE - 1996-1997critical literature survey in a non-core area of language research. For the qualifying examination, students must write two papers of publishable quality in different core areas (phonology, morphology, syntax, semantics, psycholinguistics). A dissertation proposal is required for the advancement to candidacy examination. Students are required to demonstrate mastery of a foreign language on the basis of a written examination. The quantitative methods requirement is fulfilled by a course on symbolic logic or formal language theory. Students are expected to defend the dissertation and to give a pub\u00ad lic presentation of their doctoral research. Courses in Linguistics LOWER DIVISION 1 Languages of the World (4).

Dalton, Department Chair Undergraduate Program The Department of Politics and Society offers a wide variety of courses at the introductory, lower-division, and more specialized upper-division levels. Courses in both micropolitics (individual and group politics) and macropolitics (politics at the state and interna\u00ad tional levels) are offered. The curriculum is organized into five areas: American politics and society, political theory, international relations, comparative politics, and public law. The Department also offers an Honors Program in Political Science for juniors and seniors, culminating in a senior honors thesis. The Department is composed of a strong and diverse faculty espe\u00ad cially interested in analyzing central questions of political science related to such topics as policy-making, political structures, partici\u00ad pation, conflict, change and development, power and authority, and interstate relations. The faculty has particular strength in interdisci\u00ad plinary approaches, in comparative analysis, and in the application of quantitative data to political science issues. REQUIREMENTS FOR THE BACHELOR'S DEGREE University Requirements: See pages 57-61. School Requirements: See page 325. Departmental Requirements for the Major in Political Science School requirements must be met and must include 11 courses (44 units) as specified below: A. Three introductory courses (12 units) in political science, Political Science 6A, 6B, and 6C. It is recommended that these courses be taken during a student's first two years as a Political Science major at UCI. - B. Two lower-division courses in political science (eight units). C. Six upper-division courses in political science (24 units) chosen from one of the political science modules numbered 120---179. Three of these courses must be from -one module. In addition, the lower-division introduction course to that module also is required. Honors Program in Political Science The Honors Program in Political Science is open to all junior and senior Political Science majors who meet the minimum academic qualificatimis (3.5 GPA in Political Science courses and 3.2 GPA overall). During their junior year, Honors program students must enroll in at least one Honors Seminar (Political Science H180). These courses include intensive reading and discussion of the most influential works and fundamental issues in modern political science, and pre\u00ad pare students for rigorous independent research. Students should also prepare a written proposal for their senior thesis. Proposals are approved by their faculty advisor and filed with the Department and Undergraduate Counseling offices. During their senior year, students must enroll in the Honors Thesis Workshop (Political Science H182A, offered during the fall quar\u00ad ter), and three quarters of the Senior Thesis course (Political Sci\u00ad ence 190). Students write their senior thesis, which is designed and completed under their faculty advisor's supervision. Upon success\u00ad ful completion of their senior thesis, students graduate with Honors in Political Science and their transcripts note that they were in the Honors Program in Political Science. Public Affairs Internship Program The Public Affairs lhternship Program, sponsored by the Depart\u00ad ment of Politics and Society, is designed to provide Political Sci\u00ad ence students with professional experience in the fields of govern\u00ad ment, nongovernmental organizations, the media, law, business, consulting, and others. The program is open to all sophomore, junior, and senior Political Science majors and minors. This program provides a selection of internship opportunities open exclusively to Political Science students by intern-sponsors, as available. Students also may create their own internship opportuni\u00ad ties, consistent with Departmental guidelines. Students are required to enroll in Political Science 183 during the quarter of their intern\u00ad ship. This course is supervised by the internship coordinator and participating members of the faculty. Information and applications are available in the Department office. Political Science Minor Requirements Requirements for the minor in Political Science are met by taking seven political science courses (28 units) as specified below: A. One course selected from Political Science 6A, 6B, or 6C. B. Three upper-division political science courses, chosen from one Political Science module. C. Three additional courses in political science, chosen from those numbered Political Science 6A, 6B, 6C, 20-79, or 120-179.

The graduate program emphasizes empirical democratic theory, with an emphasis on the United States and other industrialized and industrializing nations, within a comparative context. Faculty interests include political behavior, political psychology, public choice theory, political econ\u00ad omy, international relations, systems theory, mass media, and authority relations. Institutions of interest include the executive branch, bureaucratic politics, political parties, and representation and electoral systems. The strengths of the Political Science gradu\u00ad ate program include its small size, its personalized attention to stu\u00ad dents, and its location within an interdisciplinary school. Three Organized Research Units, the Institute of Transportation Studies, the Center for Research on Information Technology and Organizations, and the Institute for Mathematical Behavioral Sci\u00ad ences, offer opportunities for participation in ongoing faculty research. One group of Political Science faculty share interests in applied Public Choice with faculty members in both Economics and Philosophy; another group is involved with the program in Global Peace and Conflict Studies; and others are involved in the Center for the Study of Democracy. ADMISSIONS The deadline for application for fall quarter admission is January 15. Students are admitted for winter or spring quarters only under exceptional circumstances. Additional information is available in the general section on admission to Social Science graduate pro\u00ad grams. Please note especially the required examinations. REQUIREMENTS First-year students must take a core program of graduate seminars, focusing on major substantive areas as well as research methods. Students are required to complete one year of statistics, preferably before enrollment but no later than their first year. Competence in a foreign language is required. Students may substitute mastery of an advanced research skill in place of a foreign language. To \u00b7 acquire such a skill (which could involve course work in such dis\u00ad ciplines as economics, mathematics and computer science, or sta\u00ad tistics), students could take courses in econometrics, advanced multivariate regression, or computer science. Attendance in a col\u00ad loquium series also is required for all graduate students during their first two years in residence. Reviews and Examinations Students ordinarily are expected to maintain a grade point average of 3.5 or better. At the completion of the first year, a review of per\u00ad formance in the graduate program will be conducted for each stu\u00ad dent by the Politics and Society faculty. A set of three papers, normally completed by the third year of study, tests the student's competence in a set of major domains for intellectual inquiry. These domains are determined by the student and the Political Science Graduate Director. Upon successful com\u00ad pletion of these papers and demonstration of competence in mathe\u00ad matics and a foreign language or an advanced research skill, a can\u00ad didacy committee is appointed to oversee the qualifying examination and the formal advancement to candidacy. Students are expected to advance to candidacy by the ninth quarter of grad\u00ad uate study. After the student advances to candidacy, the doctoral committee, usually composed of three members of the candidacy committee, reviews a dissertation prospectus and supervises work toward com\u00ad pletion of the dissertation. Within six months of the oral qualifying_ examination (the formal advancement to candidacy), students are expected to meet with their doctoral committee, in order to discuss with the members a dissertation prospectus. Politics and Society 349 Concentration in Public Choice Students may also earn a Ph.D. degree in Political Science with a concentration in Public Choice. This is an interdisciplinary field, at the intersection of political science and economics, which draws on sophisticated quantitative tools to model the functioning of political institutions. Faculty from the Departments of Politics and Society, Economics, and Philosophy and from the Graduate School of Man\u00ad agement are involved in research that supports the concentration. Students who elect this concentration are admitted under the nor\u00ad mal procedures for the program in Political Science and must ful\u00ad fill all the requirements for the Political Science degree with the following modifications: (1) students must complete the core sequence in Public Choice, which is jointly organized by faculty in the Department of Politics and Society and the Department of Eco\u00ad nomics. (A background in economic theory equivalent to Econom\u00ad ics HIOOA-B-C, Honors Intermediate Economic Theory, is a pre\u00ad requisite to this sequence); (2) students must complete three courses out of a set designated by the interdisciplinary committee, such as American Political Institutions, Comparative Political Par\u00ad ties and Electoral Systems, and Theory of Political Coalitions; (3) students are encouraged to take graduate-level econometrics; and (4) students are expected to write their dissertation on a topic related to Public Choice. Concentration in Political Psychology Students may also earn a Ph.D. degree in Political Science with a concentration in Political Psychology.

Yellott: Mathematical psychology and vision perception Social Sciences 363 The concentration in Mathematical Behavioral Science offers a program of interdisciplinary and mathematical approaches to the study of human behavior, providing high levels of training in cur\u00ad rent mathematical modeling and mathematical skills. The program is administered by an interdisciplinary group of faculty. The Insti\u00ad tute for Mathematical Behavioral Sciences, an Organized Research Unit, provides research opportunities for graduate students. The program leads to a Ph.D. in Social Sciences with a concentra\u00ad tion in Mathematical Behavioral Science. ADMISSION Admission to the program requires evidence of appreciable mathe\u00ad matical skill and knowledge. As an absolute minimum, a candidate should have taken one full year of calculus, including calculus of several variables, and one course in linear algebra. In addition, candidates must provide evidence of additional mathematical depth of knowledge, which can be manifested in a number of different ways including, but not restricted to, an undergraduate degree in mathematics or physical science, a high score in the GRE Mathe\u00ad matics Subject Test, or a strong undergraduate minor in mathemat\u00ad ics. In addition, students should have some exposure to a behav\u00ad ioral science field; especially useful is some experience with behavioral science modeling. REQUIREMENTS Four major classes of requirements must be fulfilled. Since a num\u00ad ber of options are available, the student will, in consultation with an advisor, submit a plan of study to the Graduate Committee of the program. Quantitative/Mathematical. The quantitative methods require\u00ad ment consists of completing, by the end of the third year, the fol. lowing courses: (1) one each in analysis beyond calculus, abstract algebra beyond linear algebra, and logic; and (2) two quarters of mathematical statistics, with calculus as a prerequisite and cover\u00ad ing the fundamentals of probability and random variables. Language/Computer. All students must be sufficiently familiar with various computer programs and languages to be able to conduct serious research in their field of interest and must submit either pro\u00ad posed courses or some demonstration of competency as part of their plan of study. In addition, students must either (1) attain proficiency in reading social science technical publications in one foreign lan\u00ad guage or (2) demonstrate proficiency in computer programming con\u00ad siderably beyond that of the standard computer requirement. Because of the continually changing nature of computer languages and software, the conditions for fulfilling this additional computer expertise requirement will be left to the judgment of the faculty sub\u00ad committee on computers of the Ph.D. program. Substantive Minor. Students are expected to develop considerable expertise in some substantive field of social science and in the application of models to it. This requires the completion of three courses at the upper-division or graduate level that do not neces\u00ad sarily entail extensive modeling, and three courses or seminars in which the primary thrust is mathematical modeling. Research Papers and Colloquia. A research paper reporting origi\u00ad nal research or a penetrating analysis of some subtopic of mathe\u00ad matical behavioral science is expected at the end of the second year. An oral presentation will be given to faculty and graduate stu\u00ad dents. Students also are expected to regularly attend the Collo\u00ad quium in Mathematical Behavioral Science. UC IRVINE - 1996-1997I 364 UCI 1996-97 School of Social Sciences Master of Arts Degree The M.A. degree is awarded only to Ph.D. students in any School of Social Science program who complete necessary requirements; stu\u00ad dents are not admitted for graduate study leading only to the Mas\u00ad ter's degree. Requirements include the submission of a petition to the Graduate Committee along with a proposed plan of study con\u00ad sisting of 36 units of relevant Mathematical Behavioral Science courses, normally including the core requirement in mathematical statistics. Concentration in Social Networks Participating Faculty William Batchelder: Mathematical models, measurement, and cognitive processes Duran Bell: Formal models of social relations, economic anthropology, for\u00ad mal analysis of inter-and intra-group resource allocation process James S. Boster: Cognitive anthropology, social networks, study of intracul- tural variation, ethnopsychology, ethnobiology John P. Boyd: Mathematical anthropology and systems theory R. Duncan Luce: Mathematical behavioral science A. Kimball Romney: Experimental and psychological anthropology Danching Ruan: Personal networks, networks in China David A. Smith: Urbanization, comparative/historical sociology, political sociology, world-system analysis Christian Werner: Mathematical social science Douglas R. White: Anthropology, social networks and relations, cross\u00ad cultural comparison, mathematical models of social constraints, decision\u00ad making networks, and social processes The Departments of Anthropology and Sociology jointly offer a concentration in Social Networks that focuses on the patterns or forms of relations that link persons or other soeial actors together in coherent wholes. Thus, Social Networks stresses the structural interests of several disciplines including sociology, anthropology, and cognitive science. It is concerned with problems of represent\u00ad ing such structures, both statically and dynamically, and with exploring the implications of structural form for individual and collective behavior. In addition, the networks perspective has important applications in the study of international relations, orga\u00ad nizational behavior, health and mental health, and human commu\u00ad nications research. The program leads to a Ph.D. in Social Sciences with a concentra\u00ad tion in Social Networks. ADMISSION The graduate concentration in Social Networks seeks qualified graduate students who are well-trained in either (a) a structural approach in some traditional social science discipline or (b) mathe\u00ad matics. Students also should be willing to learn either a set of social science orientations and models or the appropriate mathe\u00ad matical skills to do research in social networks, depending upon their prior training. REQUIREMENTS Students are encouraged to develop their own research foci and specializations within the general social networks perspective. All students are expected to become acquainted with the general per\u00ad spective and to develop a minimum set of formal and methodologi\u00ad cal skills. A set of core courses has been developed that is aimed at acquaint\u00ad ing incoming students with theoretical, mathematical, and method\u00ad ological tools for the study of social networks. The courses are Social Sciences 201 G (Analysis of Relational Data), 241A (Inter\u00ad action Models), and 241B (Network Theories of Social Structure). These courses, or equivalent training, are required of all graduate students. In addition, students are required to complete one year of training (or demonstrate equivalence) in mathematics, statistics, and research methodology. Selection of other courses will be by agreement between student and advisor. In addition to relevant courses offered throughout the School, courses specifically tailored for students in Social Networks are offered by faculty on a regular basis. Students must demonstrate proficiency in reading social science publications in one foreign language or demonstrate a higher level of proficiency if required by the nature of the student's research plans. Reviews and Examinations Students enrolled in the concentration are expected to meet the requirements of UCI and the School as well as those of the concen\u00ad tration. In addition, each student is reviewed three times to ascer\u00ad tain progress. The first review is of the student's first-year performance. The review results in a faculty-student conference in which a recom\u00ad mendation is made for continuation or withdrawal. The second review is the oral examination for the student's qualifi\u00ad cation for advancement to candidacy. It is designed to assess the likelihood of the student successfully completing the Ph.D. disser\u00ad tation and is based on the student's dissertation research proposal as well as on the progress in course work. Students are expected to complete this examination on or before the end of their third year of residence. The third review is a dissertation defense. The defense will be in the form of a public colloquium presentation. The faculty may rec\u00ad ommend revisions, after which the dissertation may be submitted for the doctoral degree in Social Science. Concentration in Social Relations Participating Faculty Duran Bell: Models of social relations, economic anthropology Victoria Bernal: Economic development, peasants, gender, political economy, Africa, Muslim societies J6zsef Biiriicz: Comparative international sociology, development, state socialism and its demise, tourism, social change, east-central Europe James S.

It cen\u00ad ters on interdisciplinary research in social science, particularly where the traditional concerns of sociology and anthropology con\u00ad verge. Because of a low student-to-faculty ratio, each student works closely with a faculty committee to develop an individual\u00ad ized course of study. Students may work on a broad range of top\u00ad ics, including cognitive anthropology, the sociology of culture, cul\u00ad ture and health practices, family and gender, Third World development and social change, and social structure and networks. 'he program leads to a Ph.D. in Social Sciences with a concentra\u00ad tion in Social Relations. A graduate emphasis in Feminist Studies also is available. Refer to the Women's Studies section of the Catalogue for information. ADMISSION The faculty welcomes students from diverse educational and social backgrounds. Students who have research interests corresponding to those of specific faculty members are especially encouraged to apply to this apprenticeship-type program. REQUIREMENTS Each new student is assigned an advisor who serves until a three\u00ad person committee is formed. The committee oversees the student's academic work and ordinarily is chaired by the faculty member with whom the student plans to work most closely. A core seminar which meets two quarters in the first year and two quarters in the second year is required. Additionally, three basic courses in particular substantive areas of anthropology and sociol\u00ad ogy are offered each year as core courses. In each of their first two years, students must take two of these three focused seminars. Two quarters of statistics are required; one quarter must be taken in the first year. In addition, two quarters of research design or data col\u00ad lection methods are required; one quarter must be taken in the first year. Students also take additional seminars pertinent to their own research interests. Course work usually takes two years, during which time students choose an area of concentration. By the end of the third year, stu\u00ad dents are expected to have selected a faculty committee and to have made plans for their doctoral dissertation research. All stu\u00ad dents are expected to continue to participate in both the Social Relations Colloquium Series and in less formal aspects of intellec- tual life in the program. ' During the second year each student will prepare an original paper, which will be presented by the student at a meeting during the Social Sciences 365 spring quarter. The group will provide the student with a detailed written critique of the paper as part of the second-year evaluation of the student's overall progress. The advancement-to-candidacy examination should ordinarily be taken no later than the spring quarter of the student's third year. A speaking or reading knowledge of one foreign language is required.

MEDICAL SCIENTIST PROGRAM (M.D./Ph.D.) Alan Goldin, M.D., Ph.D., Chair (714) 824-5334 Exceptionally well-qualified students interested in careers in acad\u00ad emic medicine and with demonstrated research accomplishments may be considered for admission to the Medical Scientist Program. Students in this program pursue a combined curriculum leading to an M.D. degree from the College of Medicine and a Ph.D. degree from any of the graduate programs at UCI. A minimum of seven years is required to complete the Program. Students holding either degree are not eligible for the Program. Additional information is available from the Medical Scientist Program Coordinator's Office, (714) 824-5264. Applicants for this program must submit a supplementary applica\u00ad tion to the Medical Scientist Program when they are submitting their secondary application information to the College of Medicine. The supplementary forms can be requested from the Office of Admis\u00ad sions, College of Medicine. Students accepted into the program will have the option of pursuing graduate study in any of the graduate programs at UCI. Although a specific graduate department need not be chosen at the time of admission, students will be expected to have selected a field for their graduate studies. Financial support in the form of a fellowship, which includes a stipend as well as tuition and fees, will be provided to a limited number of students each year. Applicants not accepted into the Medical Scientist Program may be considered separately for admission to the College of Medicine. The M.D. Curriculum The M.D. curriculum requires four years to complete. If special needs are identified, the time may be extended to five years. The first and second years are scheduled on a modified quarter system. There is a 10-week vacation period between the first and second years; students may use that time for elective or research work in place of vacation. Between the second and third years is a \u00b7 five-week vacation, during which the United States Medical Licensing Examination (USMLE) will be administered. In the third year there are seven weeks vacation; students may use that time for electives. In the fourth year up to 11 weeks of vacation are allowed. Under the recommendation of faculty supported committees, UCI's M.D. program has undergone curricular reform within all four years of instruction. The College of Medicine faculty view curricu\u00ad lum development as a continual process and feel that medical edu\u00ad cation must be the highest priority and that teaching innovations must be encouraged and supported. The curriculum encourages medical students to become participants in their education process, facilitates active rather than passive learning, and encourages cooperative learning among students. The faculty also feel that the curriculum should integrate basic and clinical sciences by bringing substantial clinical material into the early phases of medical education and bringing substantial basic science materials into the later phases of medical education (verti\u00ad cal integration of course material). The College has achieved vertical integration of the curriculum with the development of the Patient-Doctor series. The Patient\u00ad Doctor courses are longitudinal multi-disciplinary experiences. Through Patient-Doctor I and II students begin clinical exposure during their first two years of instruction. During Patient-Doctor III and IV, students are given the opportunity to integrate basic and clinical science into a comprehensive forum and review major basic science topics through PCP conferences and patient workups. These courses also include special interest topics such as death and dying, cultural competence, domestic violence, and many others. Horizontal integration of the course material has been achieved through the development of multi-disciplinary courses including the Patient-Doctor series and Neurosciences. In addition, the sec\u00ad ond-year course directors have coordinated the instruction of mate\u00ad rials among Pathology, Clinical Pathology, Pharmacology, and PatientcDoctor II. The faculty and administration at the College of Medicine are com\u00ad mitted to the process of curricular reform and foresee continual implementation of new programs to ensure that medical students receive current and innovative education. To satisfy the requirements for the M.D. degree, each medical stu\u00ad dent must successfully complete the full curriculum (basic science, preclinical, clinical, and elective course work) with a passing grade and fulfill the National Board Examination requirement. After the second year, all students are required to take Step 1 of the United States Medical Licensing Examination before continuing their clin\u00ad ical clerkships. Students must also pass Step 2 of the Boards prior to graduation. In accordance with the College of Medicine policies and procedures, the examination may be taken a maximum of three times. CURRICULAR POLICIES The curricular policies of the College of Medicine are the responsi\u00ad bility of faculty committees. A listing of these policies, as well as UC IRVINE - 1996-1997information regarding registration, rules and regulations, grading procedures, and requirements for academic advancement, are con\u00ad tained in the College of Medicine Handbook, which is available from the Office of Medical Education and is distributed along with other policy statements to all students upon matriculation.

Training takes the form of graded responsibility for inpatient care, regular\u00b7 outpatient clinical responsibilities, and rotations in associated neu\u00ad rological specialties. The Department strongly believes that an understanding of basic research methods is essential for the train\u00ad ing of clinicians who will deal with the diversity of clinical prob\u00ad lems in modern neurology. Thus, during the three-year training program, residents have the opportunity to participate in a variety of ongoing basic and clinical research projects within the Department. UC IRVINE - 1996-1997I 386 UCI 1996-97 College of Medicine OBSTETRICS AND GYNECOLOGY This four-year program provides a solid foundation of reproductive pathophysiology in the obstetric, gynecologic, endocrinologic, and oncologic aspects of women's health care. Based on this founda\u00ad tion, training continues with progressive resident responsibility for operative and medical management and surgical techniques. While predominantly clinical in scope, the program is strongly flavored by academic and research exposure. Training is provided in general obstetrics and gynecology with rotations in the subspecialties of perinatology, oncology, and endocrinology. There are seven resident positions available each year, for a total of 28 resident positions. OCCUPATIONAL MEDICINE This residency program is offered by the Division of Occupational Medicine, Department of Medicine. It is intended for physicians who are seeking certification by the Board of Preventive Medicine. A prerequisite to participation is a minimum of one year of post\u00ad graduate clinical training in a primary care discipline.

This training is targeted to be of the caliber necessary for young surgeons to embark upon an academic career. This training is excellent for those going into private practice as well. PATHOLOGY The Department of Pathology offers a residency training program covering all areas of anatomic and clinical pathology. The program is affiliated with Memorial Medical Center, Long Beach and the Veterans Administration Medical Center, Long Beach. The training for the combined anatomic and clinical pathology program consists of six months training in both anatomic and clinical pathology each year. The first two years consist of a core program providing exposure to each of the subspecialty areas of clinical pathology as well as surgical pathology, autopsy pathology, and cytopathology. The program is flexible to permit concentrated study in one of the subspecialties of clinical pathology or in straight anatomic pathol\u00ad ogy during the last two years. Ample opportunities for research and teaching exist for individuals wishing an academic career. The opportunity for excellent prepara\u00ad tion is also provided for individuals planning on a private practice in a community hospital. PEDIATRICS The Pediatric Residency Program emphasizes the interrelationship of patient care, didactic teaching, and research in the training of the pediatric resident physician. The focus of the Department is on the total care of the child from birth through young adulthood. A strong clinical and educational foundation is provided through experiences in a broad spectrum of disease and/or injury as well as training in biosocial pediatrics, preventive health care, and commu\u00ad nity resources. The program offers variety and depth due to the diversity of the Department's two major teaching hospitals-the UCI Medical Cen\u00ad ter and the Miller Children's Hospital (located at Memorial Hospi\u00ad tal Medical Center, Long Beach).The faculty at these institutions provide a comprehensive teaching program in general pediatrics and cover the full range of pediatric subspecialties. The care of children seen through the two hospitals represents a cross-section of racial, cultural, and socioeconomic groups from a local popula\u00ad tion of more than 2.5 million. Thus, pediatric residents are exposed to a wide range of problems presented in settings ranging from intensive care to supervised office-based practice. PHYSICAL MEDICINE AND REHABILITATION The Department of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation offers a three-year residency for applicants who have completed a one year internship. The focus of both programs is on the diagnosis and comprehensive treatment and care of patients with neuromuscu\u00ad loskeletal or cardiopulmonary disabilities, from newborns to the elderly. Residents are also involved in research and medical stu\u00ad dent teaching. PSYCHIATRY The Psychiatry Residency Program is a four-year program that fos\u00ad ters individuality, academic excellence, and broad patient experi\u00ad ence. The core curriculum includes basic seminars, adult inpatient and outpatient psychiatry, child psychiatry, medicine, neurology, emergency psychiatry, consultation and liaison psychiatry, forensic psychiatry, psychopharmacology, and substance abuse. Residents spend time at the UCI Medical Center, private facilities, VAM\u00ad CLB, and a State hospital, all of which provide a broad base and mix of experience in psychopathology. A wide variety of elective courses and experiences are available in this flexible, eclectic pro\u00ad gram. All residents are expected to complete a research project of high quality prior to completion of the program. RADIOLOGICAL SCIENCES (DIAGNOSTIC RADIOLOGY) The Department of Radiological Sciences has 28 residents training for certification in diagnostic radiology. The program is based at the UCI Medical Center and integrated with VAMCLB, and MHMC. Residents rotate through all three institutions. The objectives of the program are (1) to provide individuals with a solid background in all modalities of imaging, (2) to provide an atmosphere conducive to research and to encourage opportunities for residents to participate in research work with physicians and scien\u00ad tists, and (3) to provide elective periods in which residents can work in given areas of the Department to increase their expertise or work on research projects during their residency training. UC IRVINE - 1996-1997The residency program includes specialized training in interven\u00ad tional radiology, ultrasonography, nuclear medicine, computerized tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, and spectroscopy, as well as opportunities to participate in major research programs conducted in the Department. All residents are expected to com\u00ad plete at least one major paper during the program. Candidates are accepted only at the postgraduate-2 level for a four\u00ad year program. Fellowships are available for an additional year in specialized areas following the successful completion of the resi\u00ad dency. The newest technologies in the field of radiological sciences are available at UCI Medical Center and the College's affiliated institutions. RADIATION ONCOLOGY The Residency Training Program in Radiation Oncology is designed to prepare suitably qualified applicants for academic and clinical practice careers in radiation oncology.

The Program includes obligatory rotations at four participating hospitals: UCI Medical Center, VAMCLB, MHMC, and City of Hope National Medical Center. RADIOLOGICAL SCIENCES (NUCLEAR MEDICINE) Candidates who wish to obtain certification for the Board of Nuclear Medicine or who wish to have further training in nuclear medicine must have completed the required period of prior resi\u00ad dency training in either diagnostic radiology, internal medicine, or pathology. The Nuclear Medicine Training Program involves one or two years and includes clinical and basic science components. It is a joint program with rotations at UCI Medical Center and VAMCLB. Didactic lecture series include physics, instrumentation, radiophar\u00ad macy computer principles, and radiation protection. All trainees are expected to be involved in some degree of research during the program. SURGERY The philosophy underlying all aspects of surgical training is that surgery is best learned, taught, and practiced as applied clinical physiology. Operative techniques and applied anatomy receive appropriate attention. Major portions of clinical experience, teach\u00ad ing, conferences, research, and patient care are oriented toward understanding and correcting disordered human biology. The surgi\u00ad cal specialty involves more years of training than other medical disciplines due to the breadth of diseases and complexity of patho\u00ad physiology involved in surgery. The Department offers residencies in general surgery, neurological surgery, orthopedic surgery, plastic surgery, and urology. Medicine 387 GRADUATE ACADEMIC PROGRAMS The College's basic medical science departments of Anatomy and Neurobiology, Biological Chemistry, Microbiology and Molecular Genetics, and Physiology and Biophysics participate jointly with the School of Biological Sciences in offering graduate instruction leading to the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in Biological Sciences.

Research programs in the neurosciences include molec\u00ad ular neurobiology, mechanisms of neural development, ion channel physiology, experimental neuroanatomy, cellular neurobiology, and structure and function of sensory and motor systems. The Depart\u00ad ment maintains research facilities to provide the student with expe\u00ad rience in a variety of confocal microscopy; and computer analysis of data. Students are encouraged to become proficient in multiple areas of study using interdisciplinary techniques. Students in the Department of Anatomy and Neurobiology have two major goals. The first goal is to attain the necessary technical skills, theoretical background, and experimental knowledge neces\u00ad sary to conduct innovative and fundamentally important research. The second goal is to gain the knowledge and ability to teach grad\u00ad uate, undergraduate, and professional courses in the neurosciences. UC IRVINE - 1996-1997I 388 UCI 1996-97 College of Medicine These two goals are achieved through a basic and extended acade\u00ad mic program that is tailored to the individual needs of the student. The new combined neurosciences graduate core curriculum is designed to provide all students with a fundamental knowledge of modem neurobiology, with an emphasis on molecular, morphologi\u00ad cal, and physiological approaches. In the first year, students are required to take selected courses in neuroanatomy, neurophysiol\u00ad ogy, cell and molecular neurobiology, and developmental neurobi\u00ad ology. In the second year, students select from a variety of courses including neural systems, neurochemistry, and pharmacology. Over the usual four-year training period the student is required to com\u00ad plete a practical course in statistics, selected seminar courses, at least two laboratory rotations, and a total of 50 credit hours of research. The student typically devotes the majority of the first year to taking core courses and about half of the second year to taking electives. Following the first year, the student is expected to act as a teaching assistant in the neuroanatomy core course. The emphasis of the graduate program in Anatomy and Neuro\u00ad biology is on research, and a student's participation in laboratory research begins in the first week of graduate study. Students rotate through at least two laboratories during the first year. By the end of the first year the student and the Graduate Committee select a faculty sponsor who will supervise the dissertation research. A two-part Qualifying Examination is given to the student by a Can\u00ad didacy Committee no later than the end of the fall quarter of the third year. The first part consists of a written examination in three of the following areas: molecular The second part consists of an oral examination and a dissertation proposal. The dissertation research topic is chosen by the student and faculty advisor under guidance of the Dissertation Committee, and an oral research proposal is made. The majority of the third and fourth years is devoted to completing the research and preparing a written dissertation suitable for publication. An oral defense of the dissertation research before the student's advisor and Dissertation Committee constitutes the final examina\u00ad tion. The Ph.D. degree in Biological Sciences is awarded following completion of all the requirements, a process that normally will take four to five years to complete. Course descriptions may be found in the School of Biological Sciences section. Biological Chemistry Building D, Room 240, Medical Sciences I; (714) 824-6051 Stuart M.

UC IRVINE - 1996-1997Toxicology involves scientific study of the entry, distribution, bio\u00ad transformation, and mechanism of action of chemical agents harm\u00ad ful to the body. The Program interprets environmental toxicology as the study of the effects and mechanisms of action of hazardous chemicals in food, air, water, and soil, in the home, workplace, and community, and considers experimentally and theoretically such diverse research problems as: (1) new scientific approaches to toxi\u00ad cological evaluation of environmental chemicals such as air and water pollutants, food additives, industrial wastes, and agricultural adjuvants; (2) mechanisms of action in chemical carcinogenesis and mutagenesis; (3) the molecular pathology of tissue injury in acute toxicity; and (4) scientific principles involved in extrapolat\u00ad ing from laboratory animal data to expected effects on human health in environmental exposures. Students entering the program have varied backgrounds, including chemistry, biology, and physiology. The curriculum is based on a foundation of basic and health sciences with applications of scien\u00ad tific principles to environmental problems. Formal course work is enriched by a strong commitment to student-professor interaction throughout the program. An important and integral part of the learning process is an early and intensive involvement of the stu\u00ad dent in ongoing original research projects in environmental toxi\u00ad cology, especially inhalation/pulmonary toxicology, chemical car\u00ad cinogenesis, biochemical toxicology, chemical pathology, and neurotoxicology. In addition to meeting the general admission requirements set by the Office of Research and Graduate Studies, applicants must be admitted by an Admissions Committee composed of faculty mem\u00ad bers from the Department of Community and Environmental Medi\u00ad cine. Candidates are selected on the basis of a balanced evaluation of the following criteria: (1) prior scholastic performance, includ\u00ad ing a consideration of grade point average, course load, nature of courses taken, and\u00b7 college attended; (2) recommendations by pro\u00ad fessors and others; (3) scores on the Graduate Record Examina\u00ad tion; the Subject Test in either Biology or Chemistry is strongly recommended; ( 4) an interview by the Admissions Committee, when feasible; and (5) experience in undergraduate research.

Graduates of the program are prepared to function as members of genetics teams engaged in providing clinical services, teaching, and research. Other roles for program graduates may include employment in local, state, or federal genetics programs, in categorical disease foundations, or in public education. Division faculty and staff are involved in teaching, research, and patient service. Clinical activities include evaluation, early ascer\u00ad tainment, prenatal diagnosis, prevention, and management of genetic disorders, birth defects, and developmentally disabling conditions. Among faculty research interests are gene mapping and linkage analysis using DNA probes and quantitative methods; malformation and chromosomal syndromes; late-onset single-gene disorders; the incidence and perception of genetic disease, birth defects, and developmental disabilities in underserved ethnic populations; factors in the etiology of chromo\u00ad somal abnormalities and congenital malformations; the cytogenet\u00ad ics of cancer and sexual differentiation; psychosocial issues in genetic disease and prenatal diagnosis; and delivery of genetic services. During the six to eight academic quarters of the program, students must complete a sequence of core courses in medical genetics, bio\u00ad chemical and molecular genetics, cytogenetics, child development, counseling issues and techniques, research methodology, ethical issues, and community resources. Experiential professional training occurs concurrently with formal course work in a variety of clinics at the UCI Medical Center and affiliated hospitals, in the prenatal diagnosis program, in the cytogenetics laboratory, and in certain community agencies. Participation in these and other divisional and departmental professional and educational activities such as lectures, seminars, Pediatric and Obstetrics Grand Rounds, cytoge\u00ad netics rounds, and research, counseling, and patient management conferences is expected throughout the program. Completion of the program requires a minimum of 58 quarter units of credit, a research thesis which should be publishable, and demonstration of satisfactory professional skills in genetic counsel\u00ad ing. The program director serves as faculty advisor to students, although teaching and supervision of professional experiential training is shared among all division faculty and staff, who fre\u00ad quently review student progress. In the second year, development of professional skills can be individualized according to the stu\u00ad dent's needs and interests. It is anticipated that graduates will be eligible for American Board of Genetic Counseling certification within a year of completing the program. Recommended undergraduate preparation includes course work in the biological and social sciences, especially in genetics, biochem\u00ad istry, psychology, and human development. Course work in statis\u00ad tics is desirable. Facility in Spanish or a Southeast Asian language is a considerable asset. Extracurricular and/or employment experi\u00ad ences which provide evidence of the student's maturity, interper\u00ad sonal skills, and promise as a genetic counselor figure prominently in the admissions decision. References should speak to these quali\u00ad ties as well as to the academic qualifications of the applicant. Graduate Record Examination (GRE) General Test scores must be submitted and Subject Test scores will be considered if they are available. Applications are accepted for the fall quarter only and must be completed by February 1. Because of keen competition for places in the program, a two-stage admissions process is employed, with approximately one-fifth of the applicants being invited for inter\u00ad views at UCI following an initial review of applications by the fac\u00ad ulty. Interviews usually are conducted from March through early April, and the final selection is made from among the interviewed candidates by late April.

Leslie Redpath: Cellular and tissue radiobiology including mechanisms of chemical modification of radiation damage; oncogenic cell transformation; genetic aspects of cellular sensitivity Werner Roeck: Engineering aspects of radiographic imaging systems; digital radiography; x-ray tube design The Department of Radiological Sciences offers graduate programs of advanced study leading to the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees. Both programs are oriented toward the education and training of the superior student who has the potential and desire to become a cre\u00ad ative and productive member of the medical or medical-related communities. The primary concentration of the program is in med\u00ad ical imaging. Medical imaging involves the study of the interaction of all forms of radiation with tissue and the development of appropriate tech\u00ad nology to extract clinically useful information from this interaction process. Such information is most often displayed in an image for\u00ad mat. Medical images can be as simple as a projection image as first produced by Roentgen nearly 100 years ago and utilized today as a simple chest x-ray, or as complicated as a computer reconstructed image, as produced by Computerized Tomography (CT) using x\u00ad rays, or by Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) using intense magnetic fields. Medical imaging is an exciting and rapidly devel-Medicine 393 oping area of research which is continuing to revolutionize diag\u00ad nostic medicine. It provides students with the rare opportunity to conduct research which will directly, and sometimes immediately, benefit humankind. The graduate program is based on a broad-based, interdisciplinary curriculum which places heavy emphasis on research and is designed to provide the student with a comprehensive and inte\u00ad grated knowledge of medical imaging in addition to an exception\u00ad ally high level of competence in one or more subspecialties. By utilizing the training received in medical imaging and its various modalities, as well as in medical physics, bioengineering, radiobi\u00ad oiogy, and radiological engineering, the student should be prepared for a wide range of career opportunities in university, hospital, or industrial settings upon completion of this program. Prospective students should be aware that the program is demanding and requires a broad base of knowledge in a variety of the conventional disciplines. The Department of Radiological Sciences has well-equipped research laboratories in imaging physics, radiation physics, radio\u00ad pharmacy, and radiological engineering located on campus and at the hospitals associated with UCI. Prospective students with partic\u00ad ular or well-defined research interests are encouraged to contact faculty members to discuss research opportunities. Admission to the graduate program is by the Dean of Graduate Studies upon recommendation of the Department and is based upon letters of recommendation, Graduate Record Examination scores, previous scholarship, and other qualifications. Details of the application process and information about financial support and university housing are described in the booklet Graduate Applica\u00ad tion for Admission which is available from the Department or from the Office of Graduate Studies. This booklet also contains the appropriate application forms which must be completed by the prospective student. The application deadline for fall quarter admission for graduate study in Radiological Sciences is June 1 of the same year. How\u00ad ever, to receive full consideration for financial assistance, fall quarter applications should be completed by February 1. Applica\u00ad tions for the winter and spring quarters will be accepted only under special circumstances. In addition to the usual University fellow\u00ad ships, the Department of Radiological Sciences offers a limited number of departmental fellowships for which entering students can be considered. Since the Department does not offer an under\u00ad graduate program of study, no teaching assistantships are available through the Department. Research assistantships may be available to advanced students. Applicants to the program should have a strong background in physics and mathematics. Some course work in the biological sci\u00ad ences would also be helpful, particularly an introductory course in physiology and/or anatomy. Since most students will need some additional work in one or more disciplines, the program allows for the correction of minor deficiencies during the first year, as deter\u00ad mined by Departmental review. Although the program of study is vigorous, it is also sufficiently flexible to allow for a wide range of interests and objectives. Students currently in the program generally have undergraduate degrees in either physics or electrical engineering. The UCI bache\u00ad lor's degree program in physics with a concentration in biomedical physics is an ideal prerequisite for graduate study in Radiological Sciences. Requirements for the M.S. degree may be satisfied in one of two ways. Under Plan I, the student completes the Radiological Sci\u00ad ences core program with an average grade of B or above and under the direction of a faculty advisor also prepares a thesis that is acceptable to the thesis committee. Under Plan II, the student com\u00ad pletes the core program plus a minimum of eight additional credits UC IRVINE - 1996-1997394 UCI 1996-97 College of Medicine (all with an average grade of B or above) in a given area of spe\u00ad cialization and satisfactorily passes the oral and written compre\u00ad hensive examinations at the M.S. level. Requirements for the Ph.D. degree may be divided into four stages. First, the student must complete the core program and take addi\u00ad tional course work as recommended by the Graduate Committee, all with a grade of B or above. Second, the student must pass a written qualifying examination given at the end of the first full year of study. This examination, normally given in September before the beginning of the fall quarter, consists of five parts: radi\u00ad ation physics, x-ray (including CT), nuclear medicine, magnetic resonance imaging, and ultrasound. A student who fails the quali\u00ad fying examination may repeat it at a later regularly scheduled time. Only one such repeat examination is allowed. Third, within a year after passing the qualifying examination, the student must present a detailed dissertation research proposal to a five-person candidacy committee appointed by the Dean, upon the recommendation of the graduate committee, proposed by the student and the student's advisor. Following the unanimous approval of the candidacy com\u00ad mittee, the student will be advanced to candidacy. The attainment of candidacy status signifies that all preparatory work has been completed and that full attention may be given to the dissertation research. Finally, the student must prepare and defend, in a final oral examination a dissertation representing original research in the student's principal field of study. The dissertation, conducted under the direction of the doctoral committee, represents the major ele\u00ad ment in the doctoral program; it must be a significant contribution to the field and is expected to demonstrate critical judgment, intel\u00ad lectual synthesis, and creativity. The doctoral committee is a three\u00ad member subset of the candidacy committee and is chaired ~y the faculty member responsible for providing primary guidance of the student's dissertation. The doctoral committee supervises the stu\u00ad dent's research program, approves the dissertation, and conducts the final oral examination.

McWilliams, Department ofPhysics and Astronomy Principles of Community UCI is a multicultural community of people from diverse backgrounds. Our activities, programs, classes, workshops, lectures, and everyday interactions are enriched by our acceptance of one another, and we strive to learn from each other in an atmosphere of positive engagement and mutual respect. Our legacy for an increasingly multicultural academic community and for a learning climate free from expressions of bigotry is drawn from the United States and California Constitutions, and from the charter of the University of California which protects diversity and reaffirms our commitment to the pro\u00ad tection of lawful free speech. Affirmation of that freedom is an effective way of ensuring that acts of bigotry and abusive behavior will not go unchal\u00ad lenged within the University. Tolerance, civility, and mutual respect for diversity of background, gender, ethnicity, race, and religion are as crucial within our campus community as are tolerance, civility, and mutual respect for diversity of political beliefs, sexual orientation, and physical abilities. Education and clear, rational, and vigorous challenges are positive responses to prej.udice and acts of bigotry. The University's nondiscrimination policy, in compliance with applicable federal and state law, covers treatment in University programs and activities as well as admission and employment. UCI expects all those affiliated with it to adhere to the letter and the spirit of University nondiscrimination policies and related federal and state laws. UC IRVINE - 1996-1997Allegations of physical abuse, threats of violence, or conduct that threatens the health or safety of any person on University property or in connection with official University functions will be investigated promptly and, where found to exist, appropriate actions will be taken in accordance with Univer\u00ad sity policy. (See Section 51.16 of the Policies Applying to Campus Activities, Organizations, and Students, Part A.) All who work, live, study, and teach at UCI are here by choice and, as part of that choice, should be committed to these Principles of Community which are an integral part of the guidelines by which the University community can successfully conduct its affairs. Student Conduct and Discipline Students enrolling in the University are expected to assume an obligation to conduct themselves in a manner compatible with the University's function as an educational institution. A handbook is available which sets forth standards of conduct expected of UCI students. Policies Applying to Campus Activities, Organizations, and Students, Part A lists rules concerning conduct and related matters, as established by the policies of the Regents and the Presi\u00ad dent of the University and also incorporates campus regulations. Copies are available from the Assistant Executive Vice Chancellor-University Ombuds\u00ad man, located in 255 Administration Building, and from the Dean of Students, located in the UCI Student Center. Academic Dishonesty The UCI Academic Senate adopted the following policies on academic dis\u00ad honesty on June 2, 1988. Academic dishonesty is unacceptable and will not be tolerated at the Univer\u00ad sity of California, Irvine. Cheating, forgery, dishonest conduct, plagiarism, and collusion in dishonest activities erode the University's educational, research, and social roles. They cheapen the learning experience and its legit\u00ad imacy not only for the perpetrators but for the entire community. It is essen\u00ad tial that UCI students subscribe to the ideal of academic integrity and accept individual responsibility for their work. All members of the academic community have a responsibility to ensure that scholastic honesty is maintained. Cheating and plagiarism are unfair, demor\u00ad alizing, and demeaning to everyone. Faculty members are expected to: 1. Uphold and enforce the principles of academic integrity and explain clearly any qualifications of these principles which may be operative in the classes they are teaching. 2. Minimize opportunities for academic misconduct in their courses. 3. Confront students suspected of academic dishonesty in a way which respects the students' privacy. 4. Afford to students accused of academic misconduct the right to appeal any resulting disputes to disinterested parties\u00b7 for hearing and resolution. Students are expected to: 1. Refrain from cheating and plagiarism. 2. Refuse to aid or abet any form of academic dishonesty. 3. Notify professors and/or appropriate administrative officials about observed incidents of academic misconduct. Academic dishonesty includes but is not limited to the following examples: Cheating 1. Copying from others during an examination. 2. Communicating exam answers with another student during an examination. 3. Offering another person's work as one's own. 4. Taking an examination for another student or having someone take an examination for oneself. 5. Sharing answers for a take-home examination unless specifically autho\u00ad rized by the instructor. 6. Tampering with an examination after it has been corrected, then return\u00ad ing it for more credit. 7. Using unauthorized materials, prepared answers, written notes or infor\u00ad mation concealed in a blue book or elsewhere during an examination. 8. Allowing others to do the research and writing of an assigned paper (including use of the services of a commercial term-paper company). Appendix 399 Dishonest Conduct 1. Stealing or attempting to steal an examination or answer key from the instructor. 2. Changing or attempting to change official academic records without proper sanction. 3. Submitting substantial portions of the same work for credit in more than one course without consulting all instructors involved. 4. Forging Add/Drop/Change cards and other enrollment documents, or altering such documents after signatures have been obtained. 5. Intentionally impairing the concentration of other students and/or the faculty member. Plagiarism Plagiarism is intellectual theft. It means use of the intellectual creations of another without proper attribution. Plagiarism may take two main forms, which are clearly related: 1. To steal or pass off as one's own the ideas or words of another. 2. To use a creative production without crediting the source. Credit must be given for every direct quotation, for paraphrasing or summa\u00ad rizing a work (in whole, or in part, in one's own words), and for information which is not common knowledge. The UCI Academic Senate has adopted a statement regarding plagiarism which is published each quarter in the UCI Schedule of Classes. Collusion Any student who knowingly or intentionally helps another student perform any of the above acts of cheating or plagiarism is subject to discipline for academic dishonesty. Procedures for Dealing with Incidents of Academic Dishonesty Many, perhaps most, incidents of academic dishonesty involve accusations which are based on clear evidence and which are not contested by the accused student. In such cases, if the infraction is relatively minor and there is no indication that the accused student has previously been involved in such incidents, it is most appropriate that the matter be resolved between the stu\u00ad dent and the .faculty member alone. When this occurs, it is nevertheless important that a written report of the incident be filed in order to ensure that penalties assessed are commensurate with the offense and that repeated infractions be detected and dealt with appropriately. \u00b7 More serious incidents and repeat offenses, which call for stronger discipli\u00ad nary action, will necessarily involve members of the University community in addition to the instructor and accused student. In such cases sanctions described in paragraph 52.130 of Policies Applying to Campus Activities, Organizations, and Students-Part A may be administered by the Office of the Vice Chancellor-Student Services in addition to academic penalties assessed by a fac!.!lty member. Finally, whenever an accusation of academic dishonesty or a penalty imposed by a faculty member is contested by an accused student, the student must have recourse to an appeal for resolution of the dispute to designated arbitra\u00ad tors or, in the last resort, to a properly constituted review panel. Processes for informal resolution by the Office of the Vice Chancellor-Student Services and for formal resolution before a Student/Faculty Board of Review are described in paragraph 52.122 of Policies. Additional avenues of appeal are described below. The procedures outlined here are designed to institute a system that recog\u00ad nizes that many cases of academic misconduct are best resolved solely between the student and faculty member involved, while it provides for appropriate handling of serious and repeated offenses and guarantees a fair hearing to an accused student. Authority of Faculty Members When a faculty member has evidence of student academic dishonesty, the faculty member has the authority to impose one or more of the following academic penalties, if possible following a private meeting with the student to present the evidence: 1. Issue a reprimand. 2. Require repetition of the questionable work or examination. 3. Reduce the grade to an F or zero, if appropriate, on the questionable work or examination. UC IRVINE - 1996-1997400 UCI 1996-97 Appendix 4. Dismiss the student from the course with a failing grade recorded on the student's permanent academic record. Any such disciplinary action must be reported in writing to the student in a letter from the faculty member. Copies of this letter must also be sent to (a) the Associate Dean of the faculty member's school, (b) the Associate Dean of the student's school, and (c) the Dean of Students' office. The fac\u00ad ulty member is strongly encouraged to consult with the Associate Dean of their school before the letter is drafted. Reference to (or a copy of) the UCI Academic Senate Policies on Academic Dishonesty should be included in the letter. If action ( 4) is taken, the faculty member is responsible for making certain that the failure is recorded by the Registrar on the student's perma\u00ad nent academic record. The academic penalty imposed by the instructor is final unless appealed by the student within 15 calendar days of mailing of the letter. Careful documentation of the incident must be maintained by the fac\u00ad ulty member in the event that their actions in the case should later be subject to review. Responsibilities of the Academic Associate Deans The Associate Dean (or equivalent official) of each school is responsible for maintaining confidential records concerning academic dishonesty of students enrolled in that school. All letters reporting faculty-imposed academic penal\u00ad ties for academic misconduct will be included in these files, and the Associ\u00ad ate Dean will be responsible for identifying serious incidents of academic misconduct perpetrated by students enrolled in that school as they occur. Such serious incidents of academic dishonesty, including all incidents which represent repeated offenses by a student, must be referred by the Associate Dean of the accused student's school to the Dean of Students and to the Uni\u00ad versity Ombudsman who will investigate the incident, if necessary. The Associate Dean of an accused student's school is required to notify that student of the appeal process available to students accused of academic dis\u00ad honesty promptly upon receipt of an instructor's letter reporting faculty\u00ad imposed academic sanctions. Honors at Graduation. Students who have on file recorded acts of academic dishonesty, as defined in Policies, shall be excluded by the Associate Deans from consideration for academic honors at graduation. Responsibility of the University Ombudsman Whenever the University Ombudsman's Office receives reports about acade\u00ad mic misconduct or student-faculty conflict from an Associate Dean, faculty member, or individual student, the Ombudsman will investigate the circum\u00ad stances of the incident, following the procedures specified under campus pol\u00ad icy 52.122, and will attempt an informal resolution of the case. In the event that the Ombudsman fails to achieve informal resolution of the matter, the case will be referred to the Dean of Students. Authority of the Vice Chancellor-Student Services When an incident of academic dishonesty is referred to the Dean of Students by the University Ombudsman, the Dean of Students will convene a Student Discipline and Grievance Review Board (composed of students, faculty, and staff) for formal resolution of the case. Attempts at informal resolution by the Ombudsman and/or the Dean of Students may continue as appropriate until the Board makes its report to the Vice Chancellor-Student Services. Formal or informal resolution under the authority of the Vice Chancellor-Student Services may result in ( 1) the withdrawal of all charges against the student, (2) the endorsement of the academic penalties imposed by the faculty mem\u00ad ber, and (3) the possible imposition of one or more of the sanctions described in policy 52.130, including suspension or dismissal from the University. Student Appeals When any student accused of academic dishonesty wishes to contest a sanc\u00ad tion imposed by a faculty member, the student may, within 15 calendar days of the mailing of written notification of the academic penalty, submit an appeal in writing to the Associate Dean of the instructor's school. The Asso\u00ad ciate Dean will promptly attempt to mediate the dispute and reach a resolu\u00ad tion. The result of a successful mediation will be reported in writing by the instructor to the student and to the Associate Deans of both the faculty mem\u00ad ber's school and the student's school. If the mediation process does not suc\u00ad ceed within 10 calendar days following appeal of the matter to the Associate Dean of the instructor's school, the matter must be forwarded by the Associ\u00ad ate Dean to the Dean of Students for resolution under the procedures of pol\u00ad icy 52.00ff. A student accused of academic dishonesty may, within 30 calendar days of the mailing of the initial letter detailing academic sanctions imposed by a faculty member for an incident of academic dishonesty, appeal the matter in writing to the Dean of Students, who wiil seek to resolve the dispute under the procedures of policy 52.00ff. Students accused of academic dishonesty or considering an appeal of acade\u00ad mic sanctions for alleged academic misconduct are urged to contact the Asso\u00ad ciate Dean of their academic school and/or the University Ombudsman con\u00ad cerning possible sources of advice and assistance. Maintenance of Disciplinary Records Records relating to academic dishonesty will be maintained by the Associate Deans (or corresponding officials) of the several academic units and the Dean of Students primarily to promote consistency of penalties for a given offense and to ensure appropriate action against repeat offenders. Records will normally be destroyed after five years, unless the Associate Dean deter\u00ad mines in any particular case that there is good reason to extend the period of retention. In order to ensure that minor and non-recurring infractions do not negatively impact a student's career beyond UCI, any student may petition the Associate Dean of their academic school to have relevant disciplinary records expunged after the record is two years old or upon graduation, whichever comes first. The Associate Dean has sole authority to consider and to grant or deny such petitions. The University will release a student's disci\u00ad plinary records to potential employers, governmental agencies, other educa\u00ad tional institutions, or other organizations or individuals only if authorized to do so by the student in question or if compelled by law. Acknowledgment The information above was inspired both in format and content by a Univer\u00ad sity of California, Santa Barbara, publication. The UCI publication Policies Applying to Campus Activities, Organizations, and Students, Part A provides additional details about the implementation of procedures specified above. Copies are available from the Office of the Vice Chancellor Student Services, 405 Administration Building. Anti-Hazing Compliance The State of California and the University of California have expressly and repeatedly asserted their opposition to hazing and preinitiation activities which do not contribute to the positive development and welfare of the indi\u00ad viduals involved. In January 1988, the Education Code of the State of Cali\u00ad fornia was modified to reflect changes to the State's anti-hazing statute. In accordance with the revised Education Code, students are advised of the following: Education Code 32050 As used in this article, hazing includes any method of initiation or preinitia\u00ad tion into a student organization or any pastime or amusement engaged in with respect to such an organization which causes, or is likely to cause, bod\u00ad ily danger, physical harm, or personal degradation or disgrace resulting in physical or mental harm, to any student or other person attending any school, community college, college, university, or other educational institutions in this state; but the term \"hazing\" does not include customary athletic events or other similar contests or competitions. Education Code 32051 No student, or other person in attendance at any public, private, parochial, or military school, community college, college, or other educational institution, shall conspire to engage in hazing, participate in hazing, or commit any act that causes or is likely to cause bodily danger, physical harm, or personal degradation or disgrace resulting in physical or mental harm to any fellow student or person attending the institution. The violation of this section is a misdemeanor, punishable by a fine of not less than one hundred dollars ($100), nor more than five thousand dollars ($5,000), or imprisonment in the county jail for not more than one year, or both. Education Code 32052 Any person who participates in the hazing of another, or any corporation or association which knowingly permits hazing to be conducted by its members or by others subject to its direction or control, shall forfeit any entitlement to State funds, scholarships, or awards which are enjoyed by him, by her, or by it, and shall be deprived of any sanction or approval granted by any public educational institution or agency. Copies of Sections 32050 through 32052 as well as UCI's policies regarding hazing are available from the Office of the Dean of Students, UCI Student Center. UC IRVINE - 1996-1997Computer-Use Policy The University of California, Irvine (UCI) provides computing resources and worldwide network access to members of the UCI electronic commu\u00ad nity for legitimate academic and administrative pursuits to communicate, access knowledge, and retrieve and disseminate information. As members sharing these resources, we also share the rights and responsibilities of their use. This document describes the shared rights and responsibilities as well as the consequences of misuse. Please read it as you are responsible for knowing and following these policies. We welcome your use of cainpus computing resources and your cooperation. Rights and Responsibilities Worldwide, open-access electronic communication is a privilege, and con\u00ad tinued access requires that users act responsibly. Users should be able to trust that the products of their intellectual efforts will be safe from viola\u00ad tion, destruction, theft, or other abuse. As a user sharing computing resources, you must respect and value the rights and privacy of others, respect the integrity of the systems and related physical resources, and observe all relevant laws, regulations, and contractual obligations. You are responsible to refrain from acts that waste resources, prevent others from using them, harm resources or information, or abuse other people. To help protect your files, you are responsible for setting passwords appropriately and keeping your password confidential by not giving it to another person. Most UCI owned computers are under the control of a system administrator or lab manager. Like you, these administrators are expected to respect the privacy of computer system users. However, UCI computer system admin\u00ad istrators may access user files or suspend services on the systems they man\u00ad age without notice as required to protect the integrity of computer systems or to examine accounts that are suspected of unauthorized use, misuse, or have been corrupted or damaged. This includes temporarily locking vulner\u00ad able accounts, removing hung jobs, reprioritizing resource intensive jobs, and more. Many UCI departments have their own computing and networking resources and policies. When accessing computing resources, users are responsible for obeying both the policies set forth in this general computing document and the policies of the other departments. Examples of Misuse Examples of misuse include, but are not limited to, the activities on the fol\u00ad lowing list: Knowingly running or installing on any computer system or network, or giving to another user, a program intended solely for the purpose of dam\u00ad aging or placing excessive load on a computer system or network. This includes, but is not limited to, computer viruses, Trojan horses, worms, or password cracking programs. Attempting to circumvent data protection schemes or uncover security loopholes without prior written consent of the system administrator. This includes creating and/or running programs that are designed to identify security loopholes and/or intentionally decrypt secure data. Using computers or electronic mail to act abusively toward others or to provoke a violent reaction, such as stalking, acts of bigotry, threats of vio\u00ad lence, or other hostile or intimidating \"fighting words.\" Such words include those terms widely recognized to victimize or stigmatize individuals on the basis of race, ethnicity, religion, sex, sexual orientation, disability, for example. Posting on electronic bulletin boards materials that violate the University's codes of conduct. This includes posting on Internet services information that are slanderous or defamatory in nature or displaying graphically dis\u00ad turbing or sexually harassing images or text in a public computer facility or location that are in view of other individuals. Attempting to monitor or tamper with another user's electronic communi\u00ad cations or reading, copying, changing, or deleting another user's files or software without the explicit agreement of the owner. Violating terms of applicable software licensing agreements or copyright laws. Using the campus network to gain unauthorized access to any computer system. Using a computer account or obtaining a password that you are not autho\u00ad rized to use. Appendix 401 Masking the identity of an account or machine. This includes sending mail that appears to come from someone else. Knowingly performing an act without authorization which will interfere with the normal operation of computers, terminals, peripherals, networks, or which will interfere with others' ability to make use of the resources. Using your account for any activity that is commercial in nature not related to your work at UCI, such as consulting services, typing services, developing software for sale, advertising products, and/or other commer\u00ad cial enterprises for personal financial gain. Deliberately wasting computing resources, such as playing games (for example, MUDS) while someone else is waiting to use the computer for UCI related work, sending chain letters, treating the printer like a copy machine, storing or moving large files which could compromise system integrity or preclude other users right of access to disk storage, and more. Consequences of Misuse Misuse of computing, networking, or information is unacceptable, and users will be held accountable for their conduct. Serious infractions can result in temporary or permanent loss of computing and/or network privi\u00ad leges, student judicial affairs review and discipline, and/or Federal or State legal prosecution. California Penal Code Section 502 makes certain com\u00ad puter abuses a crime (such as illegal reproduction of software protected by U.S. copyright law), and penalties can include a fine and/or imprisonment. Files may be subject to search under proper authorization. Minor infractions of this policy, such as poorly chosen passwords, over\u00ad loading systems, excessive disk space consumption, are typically handled internally to the department in an informal manner. More serious infrac\u00ad tions such as abusive behavior, account invasion or destruction, attempting to circumvent system security, are handled formally through the Dean of Students Office or by other appropriate officials. For More Information For more information, contact the Office of Academic Computing, E2130 Engineering Gateway Building, telephone (714) 824-6116, or send elec\u00ad tronic mail to oac@uci.edu. Also, students may want to read the UCI Interim Policies and Procedures Applying to Campus Activities, Organiza\u00ad tions, and Students, which is available from the Dean of Students Office. Acknowledgements This document has been adapted in part from the UCI ICS Department, UC Berkeley, and UC Davis computer-use policies. Student Records The University of California campuses maintain various types of records per\u00ad taining to students; some are maintained for academic purposes; others, such as hospital and employment records, are maintained for other specific pur\u00ad poses. Student records-that is, those pertaining to students in their capacity as students-include but are not limited to academic evaluations, transcripts, test scores and other academic records, general counseling and advising records, disciplinary records, and financial aid records. The disclosure of information from student records is governed in large mea\u00ad sure by the Federal Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974, by the State of California Education Code, and by University policy and proce\u00ad dures implementing these laws which protect the student's right of privacy, provide safeguards for the confidentiality of student records, and permit stu\u00ad dents access to their own records. Pursuant to the Federal Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974 and the University of California Policies Applying to the Disclosure of Infor\u00ad mation from Student Records, students at the University have the following five rights: 1. to inspect and review records pertaining to themselves in their capacity as students; 2. to inspect records maintained by the campus of disclosure of personally identifiable information from their student records; 3. to seek correction of their student records through a request to amend the records or a request for a hearing; 4. to file complaints with the Department of Health and Human Services regarding alleged violations of the rights accorded them by the Act; and 5. to have withheld from disclosure, in the absence of their prior consent for release, personally identifiable information from their student records, with exceptions as noted in the University student records policies. UC IRVINE - 1996-1997402 UCI 1996-97 Appendix NOTE: There are instances in which information can be disclosed without prior written consent of the student. University officials may require access to student records in the course of the performance of their assigned duties. Further, confidential information can be disclosed without prior written con\u00ad sent of the student (a) in connection with conditions of certain financial aid awards; (b) when the campus is complying with a judicial order or sub\u00ad poena; and (c) when authorized federal or State officials are conducting an audit or evaluation of federally supported educational programs. There are also other situations in which the University is required to disclose informa\u00ad tion. See Policies Applying to Campus Activities, Organizations, and Stu\u00ad dents, Part B, Section 10.721 for a list of exceptions. Normally, the campus will release the following as personally identifiable information which can be made public: Student's name; Address (campus, local, and/or permanent) and telephone numbers; Date and place of birth; Major field of study, dates of attendance, number of course units in which enrolled, degrees and honors received; Most recent previous educational institution attended; Participation in officially recognized activities, including intercollegiate athletics; Name, weight, and height of participants on intercollegiate University athletic teams. However, students have the right to refuse to permit any or all of these cate\u00ad gories to be designated public information with respect to themselves. (See the NOTE above.) If a student requests that information from his or her records not be regarded \u00b7as public information, then the information will not be released to anyone without the written consent of the student. The student should be aware of the important implications of exercising this right. For example, if a request is made to withhold from disclosure a student's name and degrees and honors received, the campus cannot release for publication information on any hon\u00ad ors received by the student, such as election to Phi Beta Kappa, and cannot include the student's name and degree earned in the campus commencement program without the written consent of the student. Similarly, if a request is made to withhold from disclosure a student's name and dates of attendance, a student's status as a student cannot be verified for potential employers without the written consent of the student. Further, if a student's last instruc\u00ad tion to the campus was to withhold from disclosure the degree granted to that student and the date on which the degree was conferred, that information cannot be confirmed for a third party in connection with the appointment of that graduate to a new position or in connection with an honor that individual received without the written consent of the student. Students wishing to restrict release of public information should contact the Registrar's Office for instructions on how to do so. Questions regarding the rights of students under the University policies and the federal law should be directed to the Assistant Executive Vice Chancellor-University Ombudsman, 255 Administration. It is extremely important for each student to keep the Registrar's Office cur\u00ad rently informed as personal data changes occur to assure that accurate and complete records are maintained. Students are informed annually of their rights under the University's student records policies and the federal Act. Copies of the Act and University and campus policies are available for review in the Reference Room, Main Library. In addition, University policies are published in Policies Applying to Campus Activities, Organizations, and Students-Part B, copies of which are available in the Student Activities Office. Complaints regarding alleged violation of the rights accorded students by the federal Act may be filed with the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act Office (FERPA), Department of j:klucation, 4511 Switzer Building, Washing\u00ad ton, D.C. 20202.

Crime within the UCI Community While crimes do occur within the UCI community (campus and Medical Center), the rates of both violent crime and property crime have remained low. Burglary and theft (including automobiles and bicycles) are the most prevalent crimes reported. The following data are provided in compliance with the Federal Student Right-to-Know and Campus Security Act of 1990 (Public Law 101-542), and similar California legislation (AB 3918 and 1094). Additional data, along with required campus policy and program information, are published annually in September by the UCI Police Department in the Crime Awareness Bulletin, which is distributed to new and continuing stu\u00ad dents, as well as to faculty and staff, at both the campus and the Medical Center. When a serious threat to the UCI community exists, informational crime bulletins are posted and circulated. SAFETY TIPS Day and night, no matter where students go, they should be aware of their surroundings, should exercise good common sense, and should use safety precautions as they would elsewhere. UCI provides a Campus Escort Ser\u00ad vice, which is available by contacting the UCI Police Department at (714) 824-5223. UC IRVINE - 1996-1997404 UCI 1996-97 Appendix Theft is the most common security problem. Students living on campus should keep their doors locked at all times. In offices, valuables should be kept locked up. Doors to laboratories and buildings should be locked by the last person to leave. The presence of unknown visitors should be reported to the UCI Police Department. Vehicles (including bicycles) should be locked when parked.

UCI crime statistics as reported in the Cam\u00ad pus Crime Awareness Bulletin are compiled and reconciled at year end and will denote crimes that were cleared at a later date and/or reflect cases that were determined to be unfounded. TO REPORT AN INCIDENT On campus, students should dial 9-1-1 for a police, medical, or fire emer\u00ad gency, or should use the emergency call boxes (identified by the blue light on the box) located around the ring mall, in parking structures, and in other parking areas. At the Medical Center, people should dial456-6123 for a police emergency or 456-6234 to report a fire or medical situation. UCI police officers are duly sworn State peace officers. They are armed and possess the same legal authority as do the municipal and county police agen\u00ad cies. They enforce the law, arrest violators, investigate accidents, and provide a full range of police-related services, including immediate response to med\u00ad ical aid situations and fire emergencies. POLICIES ON SUBSTANCE ABUSE AND WEAPONS UCI is designated a drug-free environment, and only under certain conditions is the consumption of alcohol permitted. State Jaws and University policies are enforced, and violators are subject to disciplinary action, criminal prose\u00ad cution, fine, and imprisonment. Section 626.9 of the California Penal Code makes it a felony to bring or to possess a firearm on the grounds, or within buildings (including private resi\u00ad dences), of the University of California. Nondiscrimination and Affirmative Action Policy Statements Student-Related Matters. The University of California, in accordance with applicable Federal and State law and University policy, does not dis\u00ad criminate on the basis of race, color, national origin, religion, sex, disabil\u00ad ity, age, medical condition (cancer-related), ancestry, marital status, citizen\u00ad ship, sexual orientation, or status as a Vietnam-era veteran or special disabled veteran. The University also prohibits sexual harassment. This nondiscrimination policy covers admission, access, and treatment in Uni\u00ad versity programs and activities.
