So the bone-chilled kids who hit the Starbucks in the student union naturally will seek out a steamy, foamy, extremely hot beverage to warm up the blood and restore inner balance. Unless they're students like James Rein or David Wolinsky. No cafe latte. No chai. No thanks, each says as he plops down in the nearby lounge. It's mid-December, and they're glad to be done with final exams and an intense fall quarter -- Rein, 21, from Lincolnshire, is double-majoring in biomedical engineering and music cognition; Wolinsky, 20, from Glencoe, is an English major and a pre-med. They're here for an informal reunion with me, to reflect a little on where they were just a few months ago -- in a place where the mercury never left the top of the thermometer and their lives were, for a couple of months, a world apart from the one they know now. They and a couple dozen other undergraduates were part of Northwestern's Public Health in China program, an international study seminar held over the summer in Beijing. There, the students immersed themselves in Chinese language and culture; toured clinics, hospitals and pharmacies to find out how health care is delivered in that vast country; and learned the basics of traditional Chinese medicine, pricking each other with acupuncture needles and picking healing herbs along an overgrown stretch of the Great Wall. They began their study of Chinese medicine with the centuries-old theory of yin and yang, in which all of nature is divided into two forces -- yin, representing cool, and yang, representing warm -- that are opposite yet mutually dependent. Levels of yin and yang are constantly shifting, in our bodies and in the larger world. Keeping those levels in relative balance is vital to harmony and health. Rein and Wolinsky's cheerful refusal to balance the outside cold with a Venti-size cup of inward warmth is no big deal, of course -- they likely never viewed the coffee as a fast way to balance their yin and yang. They likely just weren't thirsty. But it reminded me of something similar they did when I first met them in China, while I was there to help cover the Olympics. It was sort of a yang version to the yin of this wintry afternoon. Strolling through Beijing in August is like walking around Chicago on its hottest, most humid days -- but doing so in a down coat. Here in the early afternoon along Nancaiyuan Jie -- South Garden Street -- it makes sense to nap, as a cabbie does, parked with his front passenger door open and his seat dropped back, a wet handkerchief over his face. Or to sip a cool drink inside one of the dark, air-conditioned restaurants with gaudy red lanterns. It makes sense to still the torrid heat. It does not make sense to leave your air-conditioned home -- a dormitory at Capital Medical University -- to walk several blocks in the hazy, 98-degree heat and sweat a pint or two in order to dine on steaming-hot buns stuffed with pork. Outdoors. But Rein and Wolinsky, and their friend Grant Rahm, are hungry, so off we go. Cicadas hum without end in the leafy trees, which are planted thickly behind ornate gates painted red or cobalt blue, a few trimmed in gold. The street teems with a steady stream of bicycles, motor scooters, cars and rickshaws. It figures: The three friends hardly break a sweat as they amble past large restaurants and small shops, looking as comfortable as though they were walking down Davis Street in Evanston. They finally turn left down a dusty alley and into a small doorway. Parting a curtain of yellowing plastic ribbons that act as the front door, they enter the first of a couple of small rooms. In the back, a few older men sit hunched over chunks of watermelon. In the front room, a plump woman greets the young men as she pulls small bamboo steamer baskets from a black stove. They tell her, in serviceable Mandarin, how many of the savory buns they want. The cook flips each basket into a plastic grocery bag, ties the top loosely into handles and hands it over. The guys eat on the way back to campus, pulling the buns gingerly from the bags. Now they're sweating. Their ease and familiarity here is striking, but they say it hasn't been difficult to accomplish because, despite a busy schedule, they have plenty of time and leeway to explore. And the people have been friendly and inviting. Rein describes evenings after dinner, when neighborhood people come out onto the sidewalks to dance. Just dance, to music from a boom box. Families bring kids, grandparents and pet dogs. They dance alone, in couples and in lines, and Rein often joined in. Same with the pickup ping-pong games, held on makeshift tables along the streets. Players keep their paddle with them, should they be challenged to an impromptu match. One of the most avid ping-pong players in the Northwestern group is its field director, Licheng Gu, a Chinese-language professor and director of programs for the African and Asian Languages department at Northwestern. In the summer, he handles the logistics for the three study-abroad programs in Beijing. About 60 students were in this summer's programs, which included the one on public health, another on emerging legal and economic structures in China, and a third for students doing research in partnership with Chinese scientists. The programs draw students from every area of study, from journalism to engineering. In the mornings, all the students take Chinese language classes with teachers from Tsinghua University. Classes are taught at six levels, including one for students who've never taken Chinese and others for \"heritage learners\" who speak the language but need help reading and writing it. Later they visit such cultural and historical sites as the Forbidden City or Tiananmen Square, and take classes and trips related to their field of study. The Public Health students heard lectures by Capital Medical University doctors, and visited rural clinics, a geriatric hospital and China's largest hospital for transmitted diseases such as AIDS. In several of the hospitals, Western medicine and Traditional Chinese Medicine, or TCM, are practiced side by side. \"Public health is such an important field for students to understand because China is a country with a large population, but at the same time is poor,\" Gu says. \"To understand how the Chinese control epidemics, how a rural clinic is run or how people in the cities use them, how the medical insurance structure is run, and how public and private hospitals are run . . . it involves treatment for one-fifth of the world's population.\" The visits to the hospitals were eye-opening, the students report. Compared with the sterility of most Western hospitals, these looked casual and unsanitary. Patients were generally grouped according to ailment and, at least in the acupuncture ward, treated in astonishingly precise yet rapid, almost assembly-line fashion. \"And it was just one acupuncturist for all the patients in the ward,\" Rein says. Chris Chow, 20, a mechanical engineering student from Miami, found the hospitals more sophisticated than he'd expected, but says the hardest part was getting used to the smell -- the cloying, bitter odor of moxibustion, the burning of herbal leaves to encourage the circulation and flow of qi, or life energy. Rein says he'd be willing to try certain Chinese treatments, especially acupuncture. \"I feel like TCM has a more holistic view of the mind and body working together than Western medicine does,\" he says. \"I think there's a mind and body connection that can't be proven scientifically.\" For several members of the group, the highlight of the program was a bus trip to Linlong (Dragon Scale) Mountain, to pick medicinal herbs at the Great Wall. Along the mountain is an overgrown stretch of the wall owned by Capital Medical, to be used only for growing medicinal herbs. The group hiked for an hour through the dense undergrowth as they climbed toward the top of the wall, often walking precariously on overgrown paths less than a foot wide. \"It was the most natural and organic place,\" Rein says, \"but there was an element of danger. It was a really hard hike but at the top you could see far into the hills and the forests.\" \"It was amazingly beautiful,\" Chow agrees, \"but none of us really knew what we were walking into. We thought it would be just hiking, but we went with a guide who followed a path that only he could see.\" Ina Jani, 21, a pre-medical student from Albania who hopes to be a cardiothoracic surgeon, never found time to exercise at Northwestern, and she paid for it that day. She remembers briefly losing consciousness in the intense heat. \"I fainted, and everyone had to wait for me to go on with the climb,\" she says sheepishly. Along the hike, the students identified and picked different kinds of herbs. Later, they lunched on dishes made from organically grown food, and drank fresh herbal tea. Before leaving the Great Wall, a few members of the group scribbled messages for next year's students and put them in an empty water bottle. They buried it in one of the Wall's towers. \"Whatever you do, don't eat No. 34 of the herbs you collect,\" one message jokingly warned. \"We lost one person already. May he rest in peace.\" The day ended with the ceremonial explosion of 2,000 firecrackers -- to drive away any evil spirits the students might encounter on the mountain, according to Gu. few days before that trip, the students were in downtown Beijing to tour the venerable Tong Ren Tang pharmacy, where herbs and other ingredients used in Chinese medicine are processed, combined and packaged. According to its literature, Tong Ren Tang was started in 1669 by a doctor who sold herbal remedies from a cart. It eventually became the medicinal supplier to emperors and, now, to most of the TCM doctors in Beijing. Gliding up on silent escalators inside the brightly lit, three-story pharmacy, the atmosphere is much more like a Macy's than a Walgreens. Actually, it looks like a Macy's that has been taken over by the Sephora and Clinique cosmetics counters. But behind the gleaming glass cases and counters at Tong Ren Tang, the women pharmacists are dressed in pink and baby-blue nurses' caps and dresses. In the glass cases are jars, trays and boxes of brownish, wrinkled, dried-up mysteries. Sophia Wang, a TCM professor at Capital Medical who taught some of the Chinese medicine classes and gave the tour of Tong Ren Tang, offers guidance regarding those wrinkled mysteries. What are those dried-up caterpillar-looking things? Those, says Wang, are \"Winter Bug/Spring Grass\" -- the shell of a worm that has been taken over by a fungus. The fungus invades the worm as it is about to burrow underground for the winter. In the months to come, the fungus kills the worm and in the spring the odd hybrid is ready to be dug up. When cooked in a soup and ingested, the worm/fungus helps tonify, or nourish, the lungs and kidneys, Wang says. And those balls of what looks like plastic yarn? Dried swallow's nest, which, when taken as a supplement, relieves coughing and tonifies the blood, Wang says. There's no question about what's in a tall glass display case against the far wall: It's a deer head. On both sides of the head are boxes lined in red velvet. Curious gray discs the size of quarters lie on the velvet, carefully arranged to form Chinese characters. The discs are actually cross-cut slices of deer antler. When cooked with food or soaked in wine, deer antler helps people suffering from a yang deficiency, whose symptoms may include poor circulation, arthritis and male impotence, Wang says. Even more elaborate displays are devoted to ginseng. The most highly prized ginseng roots are those that grow in the wild and now are nearly impossible to find, Wang says. When you are buying ginseng, she advises, look for roots that still have as much of their weblike, hair-thin root system as possible. It's also vital to know the root's geographic origin, because ginsengs from different parts of the world have different traits, she says. Chinese ginseng has warm properties, so it is gentle and can be used to treat qi deficiencies. But Korean ginseng, with hotter properties, must be used carefully, and only on ill people. Using Korean ginseng on a healthy person can bring about excessive bleeding and other side effects. Then there is American ginseng, which has cold properties. It is extremely popular in China because it can be used by healthy people as a daily supplement to tonify qi. It is so popular that the Chinese tried to grow American ginseng in China, but it took on the properties of Chinese ginseng, Wang says. So it must continue to be imported from carefully tended ginseng farms in the U.S., Wang says reverently, \"from a place called . . . Wisconsin.\" Wang enjoys teaching the NU students, she says, because they are unafraid to ask questions. Even if they don't agree with what she says, they're engaged and interested in learning rather than just passing a test. She's right about them not all seconding her pronouncements. Wolinsky, who plans to be either an anesthesiologist or a psychiatrist, says medicine's attraction for him lies \"in figuring out which chemicals, and which balance of them, to use to help patients.\" \"I would definitely stick to using pharmaceuticals over herbal medicines and acupuncture since I'm more familiar with them, but also because my parents are both doctors. I don't believe so much in the spirit, but more in the body.\" Jani, the pre-med who struggled on Linlong Mountain, also favors a more scientific approach over Wang's. \"In Western medicine, you know exactly why and how things work. TCM is based on theory, and you can't really test a philosophy,\" she says. \"You can't explain AIDS with yin/yang; you yin/yang. \"With Western medicine,\" says Jani, \"you can see what it is; you can diagnose it and you can treat it. I want to have a clear explanation in front of my eyes -- not to be told that it works because it works.\" Interestingly, it is Chow, the aspiring mechanical engineer, who says he's \"not as strong a believer in science. \"I'm more willing to accept a spiritual side, a side you can't see. I don't feel comfortable dismissing the thousands of years the Chinese have been practicing and refining medicine.\" The ideal would be a fusion of the two, he says, adding, \"Anyway, knowledge can't hurt you, especially if you're a doctor.\" BACK AT STARBUCKS, Chow has joined Rein and Wolinsky in the lounge. Jani arrives as the others are preparing to leave. I ask whether any aspect of their time in China has changed them or their lives. Does yin/yang, with its central idea of balance, have any relevance? None of the students had signed up for the Public Health in China program to become converts to Eastern medicine, or with the conscious aim of righting some deep imbalance in their lives -- Chow and Rein wanted to improve their Chinese; Wolinsky hoped to see a different part of the world; Jani sought to beef up her medical school resume. But each did come away having discovered a new aspect of themselves. The discovery helped to balance parts of their lives they hadn't even realized were lacking. Rein believes he is more assertive now, and more willing to act quickly. It's because, as he learned while trying to make his way in Beijing, no one is going to do it for him. \"You need to make up your mind or someone literally will take your place,\" he says. Chow, who is Chinese-American, is the first in several generations of his family to make a serious attempt to learn Chinese. Although he has taken Chinese classes for three years and had been to China before as a tourist, this trip was the first that allowed him to live the culture and to talk regularly with ordinary people. He did not know he could feel so comfortable in a place that is so different from the U.S., even though it is where his ancestry lies. \"My parents are so proud of me,\" he says. \"Just by taking Chinese, I've definitely reached more of a balance with that part of my life.\" It is Jani who seems to have been the most deeply affected by her experience in China. It has compelled her to add a public health component to her medical career. Before the trip, she hadn't realized the impact of governmental decisions on the lives of ordinary people. \"You can see on a large scale how policy decisions affect daily living,\" she says, citing how the Chinese government managed the outbreak of SARS in 2003, and how it allowed Beijing to mobilize and rehearse for terrorist attacks. And she saw how useless even the most advanced medical treatments are for anyone who doesn't have health insurance or the ability to pay, as is the case for many Chinese. Going to China \"affected what I see myself doing in 15 years, and how to reach my goals,\" she says. The trip affected her on a more personal level too, if only temporarily. Before the trip, Jani's days consisted of classes, work and study, with a few hours of sleep and one meal a day shoehorned in. \"Balance in my life is something my parents have always pushed me to have, but I want to do so much and think I can do it by giving up sleep or a meal,\" she says. \"So I never seemed able to achieve it.\" Until she went to China. For two months, she was sleeping eight hours a night, eating three meals a day, and shopping with her friends. And dancing with Chinese families on the sidewalk after dinner. \"They were teaching us how to dance, and were so happy and stress-free,\" she says. \"I guess if people did that here we'd call them crazy.\" Now she's back to her stressful student life, but with the view that it is just one step along the path to not only becoming a doctor but also balancing her career with a family life. \"What's important is to do what you're passionate about,\" she says. \"I have big dreams, and everything I do will take me closer to them.\" With that, she gets up and throws on a short red coat -- it's no more than a light jacket, really -- and dashes headlong into the cold.
