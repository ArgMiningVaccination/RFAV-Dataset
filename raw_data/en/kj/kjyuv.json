Yes, please. A Nutritionist shares teas, broths, and elixirs to fight germs and protect your health.", "sitename": "Camille Styles", "date": "2022-10-05", "cleaned_text": "boost immunity. Whether you've been hit with the flu, a cold, or something in between, it's time to take stock of your immune health. From [functional soups](https://camillestyles.com/wellness/best-soups-when-sick/) to [citrusy elixirs](https://camillestyles.com/food/winter-wellness-tips/), we have your hydration covered. In many ways, a well-stocked kitchen acts as a home apothecary. Basic ingredients\u2014like lemons, [ginger](https://camillestyles.com/food/ginger-for-inflammation/), and turmeric\u2014are powerful healing agents. After all, food is medicine. But like all aspects of health, taking a holistic, well-rounded approach is key. Don't underestimate the power of [deep sleep](https://camillestyles.com/wellness/products-to-help-sleep/), minimal [stress](https://camillestyles.com/wellness/best-stress-relief-products-2/), and a [toxin-free home](https://camillestyles.com/wellness/full-body-detox/). But first things first: drinks that boost immune system. A swifter recovery might just be a warm cup of broth away. Feature image by Michelle Nash. For A Healthy Body, Stay Hydrated It's no surprise that diet and lifestyle influence your immune response. Getting quality sleep, prioritizing movement, managing your stress, and eating [nutritious, fiber-rich food](https://camillestyles.com/wellness/foods-to-ditch/) are some of the best ways to support your immune system. Of course, hydration is equally important. After all, a dehydrated body has trouble eliminating toxins and waste. And without an efficient removal process, your body is more susceptible to infection. Last but not least, dehydration can diminish energy levels, leading to a weakened immune system. Sip your way to hydration via a [reusable water bottle](https://camillestyles.com/wellness/best-water-bottles-2022/) and foods [high in water](https://camillestyles.com/food/the-10-best-foods-to-boost-your-hydration-and-how-to-eat-them/). Natural Remedies When You're Sick Beyond rest, what are other natural remedies for colds, coughs, and the flu? Below are six ways to use food and supplements to support your immune health. 1. Stay Hydrated No surprise here. Water helps to keep your nose, mouth, and throat moist. This helps your body get rid of built-up mucus and phlegm. Avoid dehydration with filtered water, coconut water (look for no-added sugar, like [Harmless Harvest](https://shop.harmlessharvest.com/pages/original-coconut-water?gclid=CjwKCAjw5c6LBhBdEiwAP9ejG6HGO5u29Dnnm7JaCOFYVueQQMTge3tAxwn7ynanMmrlqynZI_rfmxoCIVoQAvD_BwE)), or an [immune-boosting tea](https://camillestyles.com/food/the-cozy-immunity-boosting-tea-you-can-make-using-pantry-ingredients/). Furthermore, try [kombucha](https://camillestyles.com/food/everything-you-need-to-know-about-brewing-your-own-kombucha-at-home/)! One of the byproducts of the kombucha-making process is acetic acid. This has significant antimicrobial and antibacterial effects. This means that kombucha can help fight off infections like the common cold, sinus infection, or even the flu. Ultimately, you want to rotate through drinks that boost your immune system. 2. Stock Up On Bone Broth Because viruses usually thrive in cold temperatures, drinking a hot beverage, like broth, might help avert the seasonal flu or common cold. At lower temperatures, our bodies tend to produce fewer antiviral immune signals and leave us more susceptible to infections. That is why bone broth is so helpful. When possible, choose [organic/pasture-raised bone broth](https://amzn.to/3CrPhI2). If you don't consume animal products, opt for a low-sodium organic veggie broth. Warm a mug of veggie broth with ginger and lemon for a nourishing drink. 3. Increase Your Zinc [Zinc](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9701160/#:~:text=It%20is%20clear%20that%20zinc,neutrophils%20and%20natural%20killer%20cells.), an essential mineral, supports your immune system and helps your [metabolism](https://camillestyles.com/wellness/best-metabolism-boosting-powders/) function. With a varied diet, most people get enough zinc. Food sources of zinc include chicken, red meat, chickpeas, nuts, and fortified cereals. This nutrient helps your body make germ-fighting white blood cells. It might help ease cold and flu symptoms. In essence, zinc helps your body fight the flu virus. Consult your doctor before adding zinc to your supplement routine. 4. Eat The Rainbow Diet plays a major role in how quickly you can recover from the flu. Processed foods, [sugar](https://camillestyles.com/wellness/low-glycemic-sugar-alternatives/), conventional dairy, and caffeine aren't exactly healing ingredients. They're all potentially inflammatory. Instead, stick with unprocessed, whole foods. These are packed with nutrients and are easy to digest. Focus on [balancing blood sugar](https://camillestyles.com/wellness/meal-plan-to-balance-blood-sugar/) while incorporating whole, minimally processed foods. Think: [Mediterranean diet](https://wellnesswithedie.com/the-mediterranean-diet-worth-the-hype/). Furthermore, [kitchari ](https://www.yogajournal.com/lifestyle/health/ayurveda/healing-with-food/)is one of the best foods to eat when you're sick. It's healing and easy on your digestive system. Otherwise, consider foods like [bananas](https://camillestyles.com/wellness/foods-that-help-with-period-cramps/) (they can help curb diarrhea), vitamin C-rich foods like bell peppers, and chili peppers, as they can open sinuses and break up mucus in the lungs. 5. Consider Bee Propolis Show your immune system some love with a daily dose of [bee propolis](https://www.beekeepersnaturals.com/products/bimmunethroatspray?variant=39453845127355). This all-star ingredient contains antioxidants and other immune-boosting compounds. Bee propolis has 300+ beneficial compounds, including vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants. This [throat spray](https://beekeepersnaturals.com/products/bimmunethroatspray) has a permanent spot in our medicine cabinet. 6. Gargle Sea Salt That's right. Gargling can moisten a sore throat and bring temporary relief. Gargle with half a teaspoon of [salt](https://camillestyles.com/wellness/6-benefits-of-salt-for-a-healthy-diet/) dissolved in eight ounces of warm water. Do this four times, daily. To reduce the tick in your throat, try an astringent gargle. Otherwise, steep one tablespoon of lemon juice in two cups of water and mix with one teaspoon of honey. Let the mixture cool to room temperature before gargling. An Herb For Immune Health: Lemon Balm Have you heard of lemon balm? Of all the [herbs](https://camillestyles.com/wellness/healthy-herbs-and-spices/) to eat to support your health, lemon balm is at the top of the list. [Lemon balm](https://www.healthline.com/health/lemon-balm-uses#indigestion) is one of the most popular medicinal plants. It's anti-viral and can support stress response. As a rule of thumb, treat lemon balm as you would [any other herb](https://food52.com/blog/10787-lemon-balm-and-20-ways-to-use-it#:~:text=How%20to%20Use%20Lemon%20Balm,salad%20for%20added%20zesty%20flavor.). It works especially well in place of mint, offering bright, fragrant notes. Add whole lemon balm leaves to green salads, or chiffonade the leaves and scatter them over a fruit salad for added zesty flavor. 10 Drinks That Boost Immune System Without further ado, we've gathered 10 recipes to support your health. They're rich in antioxidants, but equally important, they taste comforting and delicious\u2014just what the doctor ordered. [Immune-Boosting Tea](https://camillestyles.com/food/the-cozy-immunity-boosting-tea-you-can-make-using-pantry-ingredients/) Immunity-boosting tea recipe\u2014aka, immuni-tea. Using kitchen medicine (ingredients you can find right in your fridge or pantry!), this wonderful concoction fights colds, eases a sore throat, and can help calm a cough. It's super simple to make and can be tweaked depending on what you happen to have on hand. [Fire Cider](https://camillestyles.com/wellness/4-easy-natural-ways-to-boost-your-immune-system-this-winter/) Have you heard of fire cider? This folk remedy drink is full of antimicrobial vegetables, roots, spices, and herbs to provide immune support all winter long. It works like this: 1. Choose ingredients that call to you (see my recommended list below) and cozy up in the kitchen, chopping and chilling for a little less than an hour to make the cider. 2. Put it aside! Ferment all of the potent immune-boosting ingredients in apple cider vinegar for 4-6 weeks. 3. Take up to one shot every day throughout the winter months. [Adrenal Cocktails](https://camillestyles.com/food/adrenal-cocktails/) Consider the adrenal cocktail an elevated glass of OJ. Unlike its name suggests, this isn't actually a cocktail. Rather, the adrenal cocktail focuses on three nutrients: vitamin C, sodium, and potassium. These are key to maintaining adrenal health. This trio also helps maintain hormone stability, proper hydration, and [electrolyte balance](https://wellnesswithedie.com/electrolytes-during-pregnancy-what-you-need-to-know/). [Adaptogenic Hot Chocolate](https://camillestyles.com/food/this-superfood-hot-chocolate-will-leave-you-feeling-zen/) Health tonic or decadent treat? You choose. If you're expecting a Nestle hot chocolate, this probably isn't your drink. It's not too earthy, but definitely tastes (and is!) healthier than the packet version. It's lush and creamy, leaving you feeling relaxed rather than hyped up on [processed sugar](https://camillestyles.com/wellness/low-glycemic-sugar-alternatives/). Cacao is loaded with essential and trace minerals to help balance mood swings. Maca is great for [regulating hormones](https://camillestyles.com/wellness/how-to-balance-your-hormones-naturally/), mood, and has a high mineral and vitamin content. Collagen packs anti-inflammatory power and supports gut, skin, hair, and nail health. Last but not least, the drink's adaptogens support adrenal health, the immune system, and help our bodies adapt to stress\u2014all important when you're feeling under the weather. [Bone Broth](https://camillestyles.com/food/how-to-make-your-own-bone-broth/) Bone broth serves as a great way to replenish the fluids you lose when you're sick, while also providing your body with valuable electrolytes from the sodium in the broth. Bone broth's amino acids reduce inflammation, and L-glutamine\u2014specifically\u2014reduces gut inflammation. This is another reason why bone broth is incredibly nourishing when you have a cold, cough, or flu. In essence, bone broth supports the immune system by giving it a hefty dose of immune-boosting minerals (without the burden of a stressful digestive process). Source a pasture-raised pre-packaged bone broth or aim to find organic bones to make homemade stock. [Orange Juice Wellness Elixir](https://camillestyles.com/food/winter-wellness-tips/) Our favorite way to incorporate 100% orange juice? In a warm, slightly spiced elixir.

This mug of citrus contains vitamin C, electrolytes, freshly grated turmeric (anti-inflammatory), creamy coconut milk, and more. Drink this in the morning or at night before bed. [Energizing Juice Recipes](https://camillestyles.com/wellness/juice-recipes-for-energy/) Ultimately, juicing is an effective and easy way to meet your [daily quota](https://time.com/4920832/fruit-vegetables-legumes-servings/) for essential vitamins, minerals, and other valuable cancer-fighting nutrients. Fruit and veggie juices supply antioxidant nutrients like vitamin C and beta-carotene\u2014both important for boosting immunity and protecting against oxidative stress. Plus, juicing can help with lowering blood pressure. Of course, [consistent juicing](https://www.afpafitness.com/blog/juicing-boost-your-immune-system-to-fight-disease) can also lead to healthy weight loss, provide the body with energy, and increase potent antioxidants to aid in performance and overall health.
