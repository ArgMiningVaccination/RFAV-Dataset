The institution does not release the records of individual students, such as grades and class schedules, without prior written consent of the student. WNC does not release information to parents of students regardless of dependence status without prior written consent of the student. A student is defined as an individual who has applied to WNC and who is or has been in attendance at WNC. The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) affords students certain rights with respect to their education records. These rights include: (1) The right to inspect and review the student's education records within 45 days of the day the institution receives a request for access. A student should submit to the registrar, dean, head of the academic department, or other appropriate official, a written request that identifies the record(s) the student wishes to inspect. The institution official will make arrangements for access and notify the student of the time and place where the records may be inspected. If the records are not maintained by the institution official to whom the request was submitted, that official shall advise the student of the correct official to whom the request should be addressed. (2) The right to request the amendment of the student's education records that the student believes to be inaccurate, misleading, or otherwise in violation of the student's privacy rights under FERPA. A student who wishes to ask the institution to amend a record should write the institution official responsible for the record, clearly identify the part of the record the student wants changed and specify why it should be changed. If the institution decides not to amend the record as requested, the institution will notify the student in writing of the decision and of the student's right to a hearing regarding the request for amendment. Additional information regarding the hearing procedures will be provided to the student when notified of the right to a hearing. (3) The right to provide written consent before the institution discloses personally identifiable information from the student's education records, except to the extent that FERPA authorizes disclosure without consent. The institution discloses education records without a student's prior written consent under the FERPA exception for disclosure to school officials with legitimate educational interests. A school official is a person employed by the institution in an administrative, supervisory, academic or research, or support staff position (including law enforcement unit personnel and health staff); a person or company with whom the institution has contracted as its agent to provide a service instead of using institutional employees or officials (such as an attorney, auditor or collection agent); a person serving on the Board of Regents; or a student serving on an official committee, such as a disciplinary or grievance committee, or assisting another school official in performing his or her tasks. A school official has a legitimate educational interest if the official needs to review an education record in order to fulfill his or her professional responsibilities for the institution. Upon request, the institution also discloses education records without consent to officials of another school in which a student seeks or intends to enroll. As permitted under federal law, an exception to the above practice is the release of \"directory\" information considered to be public in nature and not generally deemed to be an invasion of privacy. The Nevada System of Higher Education has designated the following information as directory information: student name, address, telephone number, e-mail address, degrees, honors and awards received, major field of study, college, dates of at-tendance, date of graduation, undergraduate or graduate status, most recent educational agency or institution attended, enrollment status (full-time or part-time), participation in officially recognized activities and sports, and weight and height of members of athletic teams. WNC has further designated photographs from college sanctioned events as directory information. Students have the right to refuse to let WNC and NSHE designate this information as directory information and have until the end of the first six weeks of the fall or spring semester to submit a request for non-disclosure of the above items. A request for non-disclosure submitted at one NSHE institution will apply to all NSHE institutions. (4) The right to file a complaint with the U.S. Department of Education concerning alleged failures by the institution to comply with the require- ments of FERPA. The name and address of the Office that administers FERPA is: Family Policy Compliance Office, U.S. Department of Education, 400 Maryland Avenue, SW, Washington, DC 20202-5901 It is important to consider carefully the potential consequences of restricting the release of directory information. If a student restricts release for non-commercial educational purposes, the institution will be unable to place the student's name in publications such as honors and graduation pro- grams, to confirm graduation and dates of attendance to potential employers; or to verify enrollment with organizations such as insurance companies without the express written authorization of the student. If, after due consideration, you wish to restrict the release of directory information, complete this form and submit it to Admissions and Records. This directive will apply permanently to your record unless you choose to reverse it by submitting a written authorization. ___ Do not disclose my information for commercial purposes. ___ Do not disclosed my information for non-commercial, educational purposes. ___ Do not disclose my information for both commercial and non-commercial purposes.

Since opening its doors in 1971, WNC has been dedicated to providing a wide range of educational opportunities to the people of western Nevada. In Carson City, students study in a contemporary classroom and laboratory complex on the edge of the beautiful Sierra Nevada moun- tains, overlooking the state capital. Students also utilyze two technology centers for programs in information technology, computer networking, graphic design, geographic information systems, drafting, electronics and construction technology. In Fallon, 60 miles east of Carson City, the college operates an at- tractive full-service campus serving Nevada's agricultural heartland. Students study in college facilities as well as other convenient locations. They can complete the first two years of a university transfer program and enroll in occupational courses to increase job skills while earning a certificate and degree. In Minden/Gardnerville, a classroom/laboratory building serves the growing Douglas county area. Students at the Douglas campus can enroll in day or evening associate degree, university transfer, occupa-tional, personal interest and developmental courses. To meet the educational needs of Nevadans living throughout the college's seven-county, 18,000-square-mile area, WNC also operates instructional centers in Fernley, Hawthorne, Lovelock, Smith Valley and Yerington. With on-site, interactive video and web education, students living in those service areas should be able to complete a degree program in their own community. A PLACE OF OPPORTUNITY Students enter college with different goals and expectations. WNC offers diverse curricula which is flexible and tailored to meet those individual needs. By offering a variety of degree and certificate pro-grams, scheduling classes at convenient times of the day or evening, and providing small class sizes and one-on-one counseling opportuni-ties, WNC helps to ensure students a positive and successful college experience.WNC A PROFILE A PROFESSIONAL, CARING STAFF THE FACULTY & ADMINISTRATION at Western Nevada Col- lege are firmly committed to community colleges and their mission.

They bring students valuable, up-to-date experience in such areas as business management, computer technology, law, construction technologies, sciences, health care and recreation. It is with their interests and expertise that WNC can more effectively \"fine tune'' its curriculum each semester to meet the specialized needs and interests of the communities it serves.

It is the intent of Western Nevada College to help develop greater awareness and understanding of cultural diversity. RESIDENCY REGULATIONS - (Refer to back section of catalog) ADMISSIONS AND RECORDS Room 101, Bristlecone Building, Student Services Lobby 775-445-3277 E-mail: admissions.records@wnc.eduREGISTRATION Registration at WNC is completed by Internet at www.wnc.edu/webreg/ ADD OR DROP A CLASS ADDING: A student may add a class or change class sections using the Internet up to the close of the registration period for full term. Fees are due at the time of registration for full term courses. DROPPING: A full-term class may be dropped using the Internet at any time prior to the last day of instruction. Students dropping classes should refer to the refund schedule found in the \"Fees and Other Costs'' section of this publication and the semester course schedule for the amount of refund, if any. After that date, exceptions may be made by the WNC Refund Exceptions Committee for individual cases involving illness, accident or emergencies. AUDITING A CLASS Auditing a class is a process in which a student pays the fee, attends class sessions, receives all the instruction, and generally does the as-signments and the work of a regularly enrolled student. However, he/she does not receive a grade or credit. The student is not required to take examinations. The last semester date to change from for credit to audit or from audit to for credit, for full-term classes, is the end of the eighth week of classes for a 16-week semester or the end of the fourth week of classes for summer session. For courses that meet longer than 16 weeks, or less than 16 weeks but for at least two weeks, students may change from for credit to audit, or from audit to for credit during the first 50 percent of the class. For classes that meet for less than two weeks, students may not change the credit/audit option after the class has started. After the semester begins, students much use a special enrollment authorization form to change credit/audit status. CANCELLATION OF CLASSES Western Nevada College reserves the right to cancel classes in which there is insufficient enrollment. Refund checks for canceled classes are prepared and mailed biweekly by the Business Office. CHANGE OF NAME, ADDRESS, EMPHASIS A student may report a change of name and/or degree or emphasis with Admissions and Records. Students who file a name change must present required documentation. Students may change their address, e-mail address and/or phone numbers in Web-REG. Students are encour-aged to keep information current to ensure receipt of correspondence and refund checks, and to aid in proper academic advisement. COURSE LOAD The number of classes taken by a student, excluding courses taken for audit, makes up the total credit load. The load of a student receiving veterans benefits or financial assistance may have restrictions which af-fect the classes that apply to his/her course of study. Full-time students are defined as those who carry 12 or more credits (six or more credits for summer); three-quarter-time students carry 9-11 credits; half-time students carry 6-8 credits. Enrollment in 19-21 credits (13-15 for summer term) requires ap-proval of a WNC counselor. Enrollment in more than 21 credits (15 for summer term) requires the approval of the vice president of academic and student affairs. According to the Northwest Commission on Colleges and Universi-ties guidelines, a three-credit lecture class usually requires three hours of class time per week; and a one-credit lecture class usually requires one hour of class time per week. A one-credit laboratory class usually requires three hours of class time per week.ENROLLMENT 8WESTERN NEVADA COLLEGE 2010-2011 www.wnc.eduPROGRESS TOWARD GRADUATION ATTENDANCE Students are expected to attend all classes for which they have regis- tered. The instructor may fail/withdraw any student when the stu-dent has an excessive number of absences as identified in the course syllabus. In general, if a student misses a number of hours greater than the number of credits to be earned in the course, this may be considered excessive. COURSES WITH B DESIGNATORS REMOVED Courses with a \"B\" designator (such as Math 100B) are not applicable towards the AA and AS degrees. However, if a student completed a \"B\" course and the \"B\" designator was later removed, the student may petition to have the course apply towards an AA or AS degree. Contact Admissions and Records for further information. CREDIT - ASSIGNMENT & STUDENT INVOLVEMENT The Northwest Commission on Colleges and Universities requires that each college credit entail 40-45 hours of student involvement (class time plus outside assignments). The following table shows how this determines the amount of student involvement for credit courses for the most commonly used number of credits. Credits in a Course Student Involvement .5 .................................................................................. 20 - 22.5 hours 1.0 ................................................................................ 40 - 45 hours 2 ................................................................................... 80 - 90 hours 3 ................................................................................... 120 - 135 hours 4 ................................................................................... 160 - 180 hours 5 ................................................................................... 200 - 225 hours 6 ................................................................................... 240 - 270 hours CREDIT - BY EXAMINATION A maximum of 30 credits for an associate or 60 credits for a bachelor's degree, accumulated through an acceptable credit by examination pro-cess, may be accepted toward degree requirements. A maximum of 15 credits in a single subject or related subject area is allowed. CHALLENGE EXAMINATIONS The college recognizes that students accumulate a great deal of in - formation outside the classroom without formal instruction. There are times when this information may be extensive enough to satisfy the requirements of courses offered by the college. For this reason, with approvals, an enrolled student may be allowed to take challenge examinations to receive credit in certain courses. A student interested in these examination procedures should Admissions and Records or a counselor on the Fallon campus.Policies relating to challenges are: 1. A student may not challenge a lower level course in the same subject or related area where the student has already received credit at a more advanced level. 2. A student enrolled in a more advanced level course may not challenge a lower level course in the same subject or related subject area. 3. A student may not challenge a course that has been previously at- tempted.4. Official transcripts from other colleges/institutions attended must be on file with Admissions and Records before a challenge exam request may be approved. Exceptions for unofficial transcripts may be approved by the director of Admissions and Records on a case by case basis. 5. Credits earned in challenge examinations are not considered resident credit, do not count as part of a student's credit load for any given semester, nor are they computed into the grade point average. 6. Successful challenge examinations are posted as a \"pass\" on the student's transcript. 7. Challenge examinations may not transfer to other academic institu- tions and may not count for licensing agencies. 8. WNC reserves the right to deny any petition for challenge examina- tion credit. 9. A student must have completed coursework for credit at WNC before challenge credit will be placed on an official academic transcript. COLLEGE LEVEL EXAMINATION PROGRAM (CLEP) Credit may be granted for the satisfactory completion of the College Level Examination Program general examinations. A maximum of three semester credits may be granted for each of the five general examinations (except English) earning the following standard scores: Tests taken before July 1, 2001: 500 or above.

In general, WNC will award credit as approved by the University of Nevada, Reno. Contact Admissions and Records for further information. PROGRESS TOWARD GRADUATION 9WESTERN NEVADA COLLEGE 2010-2011 www.wnc.eduCREDIT - FRACTIONAL Quarter credits are worth 2/3 of a semester credit. If a student lacks fractional credits in any area(s) of general education requirements, the student may satisfy the requirement(s) by completing other listed general education courses provided the student completes at least the minimum total requirements listed in the general education section for any degree or certificate. While an area or areas may be a fraction of a credit less than required, the total number of general education credits may not be reduced. While a specific program requirement can be satisfied with a fraction of a credit less than required, the total program requirements can not be reduced. Students who lack fractional credits in any area(s) of general educational or program requirements should see a counselor. CREDIT FOR - INTERNATIONAL SCHOOLS & COLLEGES Credit may be awarded from some accredited colleges and universities outside of the country; an official college transcript is required. If the transcript is not in English, the student is responsible for having the transcript translated through an acceptable translation service. The translation must be certified and a copy of the original official tran- script used for translations must be included in addition to an official transcript sent to WNC. WNC recognizes that some colleges will not directly send transcripts as identified on the World Educational Services web site. If a school will not directly send transcripts, WNC will ac- cept a photocopy but may only award college credit if the school will verify by letter that the transcript is authentic. In general, grade and credit conversions from foreign transcripts are made when applicable based on WES recommendations. Credit for English/communications requirements is only accepted from institutions located in the following countries: Australia, Canada, England, Ireland and New Zealand. Contact Admissions & Records for additional information on international evaluations. CREDIT FOR - MILITARY SERVICE Admitted students who are veterans and have completed more than one year of active duty may be granted non-traditional credit from a DD2-14, up to a maximum of four credits. Students may also receive credit for additional military training by sending an official military transcript.CREDIT FOR - NON-TRADITIONAL EDUCATION Western Nevada College will consider awarding credit for prior ex-periential learning to students who have been accepted to the college. A minimum of 45 contact hours or 15 hours of instruction plus two hours of outside preparation per contact hour is required for each credit awarded. The college may accept a maximum of 15 credits from non-traditional sources to include the following: Military training Correspondence courses Extension courses Post-secondary institutions without regional accreditation Certificate training Other recognized sources The above sources must meet the minimum standards for ac-creditation by nationally or state recognized agencies. Credits from non-traditional sources are evaluated on a case-by-case basis. In gen- eral, credit is awarded only for those courses or training experiences that are comparable to those courses offered by Western Nevada Col-lege. Certain credits may be applicable to satisfy course requirements for occupational degrees, while others may be used as elective credit primarily for the AGS, AAS and Bachelor of Technology degrees and for certificates of achievement, only. The only non-traditional credit applicable toward the AA and/or AS degree is from military service, as documented by a DD2-14. Non-traditional education credit will not be awarded to fulfill general education requirements except for the human relations requirement, when applicable. PROGRESS TOWARD GRADUATION 10WESTERN NEVADA COLLEGE 2010-2011 www.wnc.eduCREDIT FOR - TRANSFER EVALUATION POLICIES AND PROCEDURES Students may request to have transfer credits applied towards a West-ern Nevada College degree or certificate by submitting a \"Petition for Evaluation\" form to Admissions and Records. Students must submit official transcripts or training records before the evaluation will be completed. Credits earned in institutions that are accredited by one of the six, regional accrediting associations (MSCHE, NCA, NEASC, NWCCU, SACS, WASC) are normally transferable, provided the courses are comparable to those offered by Western and are applicable toward degree requirements. Credits earned from non-accredited schools will be considered non-traditional education. Only transfer credits that apply toward a requirement (includ-ing required electives) will be applied toward a degree or certificate. Western Nevada College can accept transfer credits as follows: A maximum of 45 semester credits or 75 percent of the total credits required for a degree, whichever is greater, may be accepted from regionally accredited colleges or universities toward an associate degree. A maximum of 90 semester credits or 75 percent of the total credits required for a degree, whichever is greater, may be accepted from regionally accredited colleges or universities toward a bachelor's degree. A maximum of 30 semester hours of credit may be accepted from approved credit by examination programs. A maximum of 15 semester hours of credit or 25 percent of the total credits for a degree may be accepted from non-traditional pro-grams. A maximum of 45 credits or 75 percent of the total credits for a degree, whichever is greater, from other sources as listed above may be applied toward an associate degree. A maximum of 90 credits or 75 percent of the total credits for a degree, whichever is greater, from other sources as listed above may be applied toward a bachelor's degree. A maximum of 15 semester hours of credit from other sources as listed above may be applied toward a certificate. Grades are not transferable but may be utilized when determining eligibility for financial assistance and/or admission to special academic programs and to determine the minimum GPA required for gradua-tion. After Admissions and Records receives a petition for evaluation request and all transcripts and training materials to be evaluated, a written degree progress or degree audit report will be mailed to the student. The processing time is approximately six to 12 weeks after all materials have been received. CREDIT FOR - TRANSFER EVALUATION REQUIREMENTS Courses from Nevada System of Higher Education institutions will be accepted for equivalent courses per common course numbering. Courses from other institutions will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis based on the course title, designator, credits, and course numbering system used by the institution and course description if available. Upper division courses are generally not accepted for general education requirements. Upper division courses may apply toward emphasis requirements, and are evaluated on a case by case basis. In general, graduate level courses are not accepted to fulfill degree and/ or certificate requirements. For program requirements, if the information provided on the transcript is not sufficient for Admissions and Records to make a determination as to course applicability toward the student's desired program, a faculty member from the corresponding program will be consulted. The faculty member will decide on the applicability of the transfer course toward program requirements. CREDIT FOR - TRANSFER APPEALS PROCESS If a student disagrees with a transfer credit evaluation the student is encouraged to obtain and submit to Admissions and Records further written information about the course in question, such as a course outline or syllabus, and/or a course description. If a student questions an evaluation from a non-traditional source, the student is encouraged to obtain further written information about the training, including number of hours of the training, information about the training source, accreditation, etc. Admissions and Records will consider amending the original evaluation if such information is provided. If such information is not available, and/or if the student dis-agrees with the second evaluation, he/she may file a Transfer Credit Evaluation Appeal. A counselor who assists Admissions and Records with transfer evaluations will be consulted for a second opinion for consideration of the registrar. If the appeal is denied, the student will be given a reason for denial in writing. If the reason is a result of a course not meeting basic rules and policies, for instance if a course does not fulfill the minimum number of credits required, the course was developmental, not completed at a regionally accredited institution, etc. the decision will be final. If the reason is not based on such a policy and the student dis-agrees with the decision from the first appeal, the student may submit a second appeal. The appropriate division chair will be consulted for an opinion. Admissions will provide the division chair with a copy of the course description and any additional information submitted by the student. The division chair may designate a faculty member in the specific department of the course or the degree/certificate program to act on the student's behalf. The resulting decision is final unless one cannot be reached, in which case the registrar will make the final determination. If a request is denied, the student will be given a reason for the denial in writing. The decision from the second appeal will be final.PROGRESS TOWARD GRADUATION 11WESTERN NEVADA COLLEGE 2010-2011 www.wnc.eduGRADES The following grading policies apply to WNC. Additional specific requirements may appear elsewhere in this chapter. GRADE GRADE POINT VALUE \"A\" Superior ....................................... 4.0 Audit \"W\" Withdrawal 1. The \"Plus\" and Minus\" is a part of the grading scale for each insti- tution. It is up to individual faculty members to exercise this option. 2. The \"F\" grade is a part of the grading scale for each institution. All grades are awarded according to faculty members' judge-ments. Students may repeat failed courses. 3. Withdrawal indicates that the student did not complete the course. 4. The course syllabus shall contain a clear explanation of the grad-ing scale to be used by the faculty member. Students may not appeal the format an instructor chooses. 5. \"I\" GRADE: An Incomplete grade may be given by the instructor when a student has completed 75 percent of the course work with a grade of at least \"C,\" but where there is some verifiable, compelling reason for the lack of completion. College regulations limit the amount of time the student has to make up assignments or examinations. The \"I'' (Incomplete) must be made up during the following semester. Failure to do so will result in the \"I'' grade being changed to a \"W.'' A student wishing to complete the work for a course in which he/she received an Incomplete must make arrangements with the instructor who issued the Incomplete grade. A grade change is due to Admissions & Records by the last day of the next regular semester.PROGRESS TOWARD GRADUATION 12GRADE APPEAL: A grade appeal is the process for students who believe the grade that they received for a course is incorrect. A grade appeal must be initiated no later than 30 instructional days into the following regular semester and must follow the following process:1. Prior to activation of the formal grade appeal process it is recom-mended that the student discuss his/her complaint with the instruc- tor who issued the grade. If the student cannot reach the instructor, or if the grade is not resolved by the instructor, the student must file a written intent to appeal the grade with the instructor's division office. 2. Once the written notice is filed, the student must contact the divi- sion chair. The division chair will arrange a meeting between him/ herself, the instructor and the student, or between the instructor and the student if such a meeting has not yet taken place. 3. If the grade appeal is still unresolved, the student must submit details in writing to the vice president for Academic and Student Affairs who will act on the grade appeal within 15 days of being notified. 4. Within 15 days of the receipt of the written certified letter, a hear- ing committee composed of the division chair, two faculty members of the same division and two students chosen by the Associated Students of Western Nevada president will meet to hear the grade appeal. The instructor and the student who is appealing the grade will be invited to be present when this committee meets. 5. The written recommendation of this hearing committee will be for- warded to the vice president for Academic and Student Affairs who will act on the grade appeal within 15 days of being notified. REPEAT ADJUSTMENT REQUEST A student may repeat a course and have only the highest grade counted as part of his/her total grade point average; all grades will remain on the student transcript. Students will not receive duplicate credit for repeated courses unless the course is designated as repeatable for credits. Students may repeat courses provided they have fulfilled current course prerequisites and met criteria established for courses with selec-tive admissions criteria. Students may petition to repeat up to 12 credits with an adjust- ment to the previous grade(s). If approved, the original grade will be reflected as an \"R\" for repeat. The \"R\" will only be used as a re-placement if the repeated course earns a grade higher than the grade originally earned. Repeat adjustment may not be applied to W or AD grades. A repeat adjustment request must be submitted to Admissions and Records no later than four weeks past the published date on which grades are posted, for the semester in which the course was repeated. If a student requests a repeat adjustment for a course that is designated as repeatable for credit, he/she will not receive additional credits for the repeated course.WESTERN NEVADA COLLEGE 2010-2011 www.wnc.eduACADEMIC RENEWAL Students may petition to have an entire semester of course work dis- regarded in all calculations regarding academic standing and grade point average. Eligibility for academic renewal is subject to the following condi- tions: 1) At the time the petition is filed, at least one year must have elapsed since the most recent course work to be disregarded was completed. 2) In the interval between the completion of the most recent course work to be disregarded and the filing of the petition, students shall have completed at least 12 acceptable credits of course work at a regionally accredited institution of higher education with a grade-point average of at least 2.5 on all work completed during that interval. Courses taken during the interval may be repeats of previously attempted college work. The student's filed petition must specify the semester to be disre- garded. A semester with only \"W\" grades may not be considered for academic renewal. If the petition is approved under this policy, the student's perma- nent academic record will be suitably marked to indicate that no work taken during the disregarded semester, even if satisfactory, may apply toward graduation requirements, and the grades will not be calculated into the student's grade point average. However, all course work will remain on the academic record, ensuring a true and accurate academic history. The original grades earned will be calculated toward satisfac-tory academic progress for financial aid. Academic renewal can occur only once during a student's academic career. Academic renewal can only be applied prior to graduation from the first degree or certificate. Once a student graduates, academic renewal cannot be retroactively applied. HONORS PROGRAM The Western Nevada College Honors Program challenges students to achieve their highest academic potential. Students enrolled in any academic discipline are eligible to participate in the Honors Program. Program benefits include: A chance to demonstrate dedication to academic excellence and love of learning The opportunity to work closely with college instructors Honors recognition on transcripts and upon graduation Annual year-end competition for \"Best Honors Project\" High-quality recommendations from college faculty for career, scholarship or further educational opportunities Western students with a 3.0 or higher cumulative grade point aver- age or recent high school graduates with an exit grade point average of 3.0 or higher are eligible to apply. Students in the program earn honors credit for a course by under-taking an honors project in addition to the regular course requirements. The project is completed on a contractual basis with an individual faculty member. An honors project can be undertaken in any class at the 100 level or above, with the instructor's approval. To receive honors credit, the student must receive a grade of \"B\" or better for the course and complete the contracted project to the satisfaction of the course instructor. Honors Program participants who receive honors credit in 18 or more course units in at least six different academic disciplines and who have at least a 3.5 GPA at the time of graduation are designated as Honors Graduates.

Any applicant for graduation who fails to meet degree requirements must submit a new application and repay the application fee for a subsequent graduation date. RELEASE OF TRANSCRIPTS FROM OTHER INSTITUTIONS When a transcript from another institution is received by Admissions and Records, the transcript becomes the official property of Western Nevada College. Admissions and Records does not release or provide copies of a student's official transcript from another institution to third parties or to students. Upon request, students may view their transcript from another institution and take notes in regards to classes, semester, and grades, but may not have a copy. Exceptions to the policy are at the discretion of the registrar and are only granted in extreme cases such as: 1) the institution housing the original records has been destroyed and West-ern Nevada has the only known existing transcript, or 2) international transcripts that the student is unable to obtain. SATISFACTORY DEGREE PROGRESS Students seeking degrees or certificates are expected to maintain a minimum grade point average (GPA) of 2.0 (A=4.0, B=3.0, C=2.0, etc.). Students with a GPA of 2.0 or higher are considered in good standing. Failure to maintain an overall GPA of 2.0 may result in a student being placed on academic probation and must obtain permission from Coun-seling Services before any future registration will be allowed. Academic probation will be removed when the student's overall Western Nevada College GPA is 2.0 or higher. STUDENT RECORDS Educational records are kept by Admissions and Records. The following records are retained permanently: Applications for Admission Final grade rosters and grade change/incomplete forms Privacy notice/directory release forms unless terminated by studentSchedule of classes Files of student graduates The following records are kept for five years after a student's date of graduation or date of last attendance: Incoming transcripts or other credit sources Personal Identification data change forms Residency applications Special enrollment authorizations STUDENT RESPONSIBILITIES Students are responsible to read the college catalog and schedule and understand important policy, procedure and deadline information.

FEE - COMMUNITY EDUCATION Non-credit Community Education courses receive no state funding and therefore must be self-supporting. Fees may vary from others at WNC. Student fees cover the cost of the instructor's salary, supplies, equipment and other overhead costs. Fees for Community Education courses may not be deferred. Nevada residents age 62 or older receive a 20 percent discount on Community Education fees other than lab fees. FEE - GRADUATION Each student who earns an associate degree or certificate is required to pay a $25 graduation fee. If dual degrees or certificates are awarded at the same time, a separate fee is charged for each award. FEE - PAYMENT Fees may be paid by MasterCard, Visa or Discover card at most of the college's teaching centers or by Internet at www.wnc.edu. The college does not furnish counter checks and under no circumstances will it accept post-dated checks or altered checks. A $25 collection fee will be assessed for any check returned unpaid by the bank. Such checks must be made good within 10 days of the bank's notification to the student or \"financial hold'' procedures will be instituted. FEE - PERSONS AGE 62 OR OLDER Nevada residents 62 years or older are not required to pay application fees. Per credit registration fees may also be waived on the basis of space available in the course as scheduled and based on the consent of the instructor. Lab and other fees are the responsibility of the stu-dent. Additional regulations may apply. Consult Admissions and Records. FEE - REFUNDS The college's refund policy applies to both resident and non-resident students in all programs, and to all registration fees for withdrawal or net credit reduction, except for non-credit courses. The application fee is not refundable and cannot be transferred to another person or to another fee. Refund of fees for withdrawal from WNC semester-long classes is contingent upon the following: 100 percent if the withdrawal is completed prior to the first day of the semester. 90 percent if the withdrawal is completed by the end of late registration (five working days into semester). NOTE: Community Education courses do not have a 90 percent refund period. Short-term course refund policies DO NOT follow full-term guidelines. Courses that are scheduled to begin at a date different from the regular semester and/or after the beginning of the semester must be dropped prior to the first class session for a 100 percent refund. Once the class has started, no refund of any amount will be given. Refund checks for dropped classes are prepared and mailed biweekly. Payment will be made to the student and any other contributing agencies in proportion to the payment of the original fees made by each at the time of registration. Drops must be made by Internet before a refund can be issued. Refunds after published deadlines will not be considered for reasons which are beyond the control of the college. Not attending class, job transfers, changes in work schedule, relocation, etc., will not be considered grounds for refund appeals. Refund appeals with verifiable evidence may be granted during the first half of the semester for the following reasons: induction or activation into the armed forces; death of the student's spouse, child, parent or legal guardian; death of the student; verifiable error on the part of the college; and verifiable incapacity, illness or injury which prevents the student from returning to school for the remainder of the semester. In general, no refund is made after the first half of the semester. FEE - REGISTRATION The registration fee for lower division classes is $69.25 per credit and for upper division classes $113.25 per credit (except for Community Education classes). The fee to audit a class is the same as the fee to register for credit. NOTE: some classes also carry a special use or lab fee. FEE - SPECIAL EXAMINATION A $25 fee may be assessed for each special examination administered to a student or member of the community. FEE - TECHNOLOGY The NSHE Board of Regents has approved a technology fee of $5.50 per credit. Reduced state revenue forecasts have made these increases necessary. The technology fee funds unmet technological needs in computing and information delivery systems and enables WNC to stay abreast of the latest technology. DELAYED PAYMENTS In fall and spring semesters, a student enrolling during the college's regular registration period for six or more credits may defer payment on 50 percent of the consolidated registration or out-of-state tuition fees. The balance must be paid no later than the Friday of the sixth week of instruction. Application fees, laboratory and special use fees, the cost for Community Education courses, and the cost of textbooks may not be deferred. Students who fail to make their deferred pay-ment on time are placed on \"financial hold'' by the college and are not allowed to defer fees again for one year. Failure to attend class will not release students from their obligation to pay deferred fees. A penalty fee of $10 or 10 percent, whichever is greater, or any part thereof, will be charged against the total amount owed. DELINQUENT ACCOUNTS A student or former student who at the end of the sixth week of any semester has a delinquent account arising from unpaid tuition fees will automatically be placed on financial hold by the college. Students who have not repaid emergency loans or returned borrowed college property may also be placed on financial hold. Students on financial hold may not receive a transcript of record, register for courses, or be awarded a certificate or diploma at any NSHE institution until the delinquent account is cleared and the financial hold removed. All de-linquent accounts may be sent to collection after 90 days. The student will also be responsible for collection and legal fees.FEES & COSTSWESTERN NEVADA COLLEGE 2010-2011 www.wnc.eduGOOD NEIGHBOR TUITION POLICY A graduate of a specifically designated high school or community college from a state bordering Nevada may be granted a reduced nonresident tuition when enrolling at WNC.

INFORMATION Disability Assistance office administers a number of financial aid programs including grants, scholarships, loans and part-time employ- ment to assist in meeting the financial needs of WNC students. Most financial aid is \"need based,\" that is, based on calculation formulas prescribed by the U.S. Department of Education. To apply for financial aid, students should complete the Free Ap- plication for Federal Students Aid (FAFSA) at www.fafsa.gov., listing WNC as a college choice. The school code is 013896. To ensure that funds are available when classes begin, students should complete the FAFSA at least six weeks prior to the semester. Financial assistance is offered as a \"package\" of aid which may include any combination of grants, scholarships, loans and work-study. The amount and type of aid depends upon students' financial need, level of enrollment, expected family contribution, availability of funds and other resources. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA Financial aid may be available in the form of grants, loans, scholarships and student employment. These programs are regulated by federal (Title IV), state and campus guidelines. In general, eligibility require- ments include, but are not limited to the following: be a U.S. citizen or an eligible noncitizen with appropriate documentation. be a regular student enrolled in an eligible program. be registered with Selective Service (if required). have earned a high school diploma or its recognized equivalent (GED). be working toward an approved degree or certificate. file a statement of educational purpose. be making satisfactory academic progress. not owe a refund of, or be in default on, Title IV funds and sign a certification to that effect. have financial need (except for unsubsidized Stafford Loans). not have borrowed in excess of loan limits. provide a verified Social Security number. not have property subject to a judgment lien for a debt owed to the United States. TYPES OF AID GRANTS Grants are a type of aid from the federal government, state or the col-lege that does not require repayment. These awards are most often awarded to students who have financial need. Western Nevada Col-lege participates in several need-based federal and state-funded grant programs including the Federal Pell Grant, Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant, LEAP Grants, etc. LOANS Educational loans are types of financial aid that must be repaid and will include accrued interest. Subsidized Stafford Loans are \"need-based.\" The federal government pays the interest to the lender while students are enrolled at least half-time during the \"grace period\" and authorized periods of deferment. Interest accrues when the student graduates or does not enroll at approved higher education institution. Unsubsidized Stafford Loans are not based on need. The loan principal is deferred, but students pay the interest monthly or quarterly while enrolled or may defer the interest and add it to the loan principal. This is known as \"interest capitalization.\" WESTERN NEVADA COLLEGE 2010-2011 www.wnc.edu SERVICES FOR STUDENTS AND COMMUNITY 21MILLENNIUM SCHOLARSHIP In 1999, Gov. Kenny Guinn's Millennium Scholarship initiative was enacted into law by the Nevada Legislature. Each Millennium Scholar-ship is worth up to $10,000. A student attending WNC and using his or her Millennium Schol- arship must enroll in a minimum of six credits in a degree or certificate program and will receive $40 per credit hour up to 12 credits maximum for lower division courses (100 & 200 level) and $60 for upper division courses (300 & 400 level). The Millennium Scholarship does not pay for developmental courses under the 100 level. INFORMATION Office of the State Treasurer . . . http://nevadatreasurer.gov SCHOLARSHIPS Scholarships are typically merit based awards that do not have to be repaid. Scholarships are funded from a variety of sources such as Western Nevada College, private businesses, tribes, clubs, organiza-tions, donors, etc. A separate application is necessary to apply for these funds. The application deadline for the fall 2010/spring 2011 academic year is April 1, 2010. Students are encouraged to actively search out scholarships, be aware of deadlines and apply early. Completion of the FAFSA is also encouraged to establish financial need and possible eligibility for Title IV aid. www.wnc.edu/studentservices/financial/funding-scholarships.php STUDENT EMPLOYMENT Employment opportunities may include the Federal Work Study, Re-gents Awards Program and the Nevada Student Employment Program. Employment can be on or off campus (Carson City, Fallon and Douglas) and work hours can be arranged according to class schedules. Student employment positions provide students with valuable work experi-ence. These opportunities allow students to earn money while enrolled in school to help pay for educational expenses. The awards will not be disburse in lump sums, but in bi-weekly paychecks for hours actually worked. Because work is required for this type of financial aid, employ-ment is considered a form of self-help aid. To be considered for some student employment programs, students must complete the FAFSA. HOW TO APPLY To apply for financial aid, students should complete the Free Ap- plication for Federal Student Aid. The FAFSA application is used to determine eligibility for both state and federal assistance programs. When completing the FAFSA, students will need WNC's Title IV code number, 013896. The FAFSA is usually available by January for the following aca- demic year. Many types of funding in this section are limited and may run out, so applying early is important. To complete a FAFSA go online to www.fafsa.gov. OBTAIN A PIN TO APPLY ONLINE Students who don't have a PIN from the Department of Education will need to get one. This is not the same as the WNC PIN that is used to register for classes. A Department of Education PIN allows students to electronically \"sign\" the FAFSA application, reducing processing time. Students under age 24 may also need parents to sign the FAFSA form. Parents can also request a PIN, since they must sign for any information they enter electronically. Request a PIN at www.pin.ed.gov/ or when completing the FAFSA on the web application, www.fafsa.gov. To be considered for financial aid, students must submit the proper forms and meet all deadlines. Students should keep in mind that apply-ing for and receiving financial aid is a lengthy and, at times, complicated process. Timing is important - the earlier students act, the earlier they can be notified about eligibility for assistance. Students should allow at least 45 days before the semester begins to complete the application process. Financial aid is based on the number of credits in which a student enrolls, as indicated on the student's financial aid application form. If a student enrolls in a number of credits different than what is listed on the award letter, the student's file may need to be reprocessed, and there may be a delay in the student's receipt of financial aid. SATISFACTORY ACADEMIC PROGRESS Withdrawing from classes may require a repayment of financial aid. Students receiving federal or state financial assistance must maintain satisfactory academic progress to remain eligible for such assistance. At a minimum, a student must satisfactorily complete 67 percent of all classes attempted each semester and the cumulative completion rate must be 67 percent or higher. The student must also maintain a minimum cumulative grade point average of 2.0, a \"C\" average. The student must be enrolled as a \"regular student\" in an approved degree or certificate program, declare a specific degree or certificate objective, and satisfy the above mentioned minimum credit completion and grade point require-ments. Completion of less than 67 percent of the semester or cumulative courses attempted will result in suspension of aid eligibility. A student must complete a degree or certificate program within a reasonable length of time. A maximum of 90 attempted credits is allowed for financial assistance including credits from other schools whether aid is received or not. A complete explanation of the Western Nevada Col-lege Financial Assistance Standards of Satisfactory Academic Progress is available on the college web site. WESTERN NEVADA COLLEGE 2010-2011 www.wnc.edu 22 SERVICES FOR STUDENTS AND COMMUNITY REINSTATEMENT-APPEAL PROCEDURE A student who is notified that he/she has been placed on suspension status may appeal for reinstatement of assistance. The student may complete a Financial Assistance Appeal Form obtainable from the Office of Financial Assistance or on the college web site. The appeal must be based on circumstances beyond the student's control such as death in the family, illness, an unforeseen emergency or extenuating circumstances. The appeal will be reviewed by the Financial Assistance Appeals Com-mittee; all decisions are final. INFORMATION Financial Assistance .............................................................. 775-445-3264 www.wnc.edu/studentservices/financial/ STUDENT RESPONSIBILITIES Students receiving financial aid from WNC are required to accept certain responsibilities to receive their aid package and/or maintain eligibility for continued aid awards. Enrollment: Students must be enrolled in an approved degree program. Any changes (higher or lower) in number of credits will result in the financial aid award not being disbursed. Full-Time: If a student's award is based on full-time enrollment, the student must maintain 12 or more credits. 3/4 Time: If a student's award is based on three-quarter time enrollment, the student must maintain 9-11 credits. 1/2 Time: If a student's award is based on half-time enrollment, the student must maintain 6-8 credits. Less than 1/2 Time: If a student's award is based on less than half-time enrollment, the student must maintain 1-5 credits. Change of Status - Students are required to notify the Financial Assis-tance office in writing of any event that may alter their financial status such as change in marital status, receipt of additional educational benefits or acceptance of a scholarship. If it is determined that a student received money that exceeded his/her eligibility, the student is liable for repay-ment of the over-awarded amount. Students should notify Admissions and Records of any changes in name, address, e-mail address, phone number or educational major. This will ensure that the student receives all correspondence from the college and meets financial aid requirements. Proper Use of Funds - Financial aid funds are to be used for educationally related expenses only. Direct educational costs are tuition, fees, books and supplies. Indirect educational costs include expenses for room and board, transportation, and other applicable living expenses incurred while attending Western Nevada College. STUDENT RIGHTS Students have an equal opportunity to receive financial assistance. After making proper application, students are entitled to expect an equitable determination for eligibility of available funds. Each student's application is individually reviewed using the same evaluation criteria. Students have a right to have access to information about all types of aid available at Western Nevada College, minimum requirements for eligibility and the academic programs available. Students have a right to information regarding repayment schedules and interest rates for loans. This information is available in financial aid publications, but it is still important for students to read their own promissory note carefully before signing, including e-signing.

Formal grievance procedures are initiated only after informal attempts have been found unsatisfactory in reaching a just solution. A grievance must be filed in writing to the appropriate dean within 30 instructional days of the alleged infraction. 2. Members of a grievance committee will be selected by the appropriate dean. This committee will consist of the appropriate dean, two faculty members, one student, one representative from the associated students of Western Nevada and may also include a classified employee. 3. The student and involved parties will be given the opportunity to present their case in a formal hearing to the selected grievance committee. 4. The committee will then recommend a course of action to the vice president for Academic and Student Affairs. 5. The student will receive written notification from the vice president for Academic and Student Affairs of the final decision.

Accordingly, students are advised that disclosure of their social security number is not required as a condition of registration at WNC. All stu-dents will be assigned a student identification number by Admissions and Records, which may be used in lieu of a social security number. Students will need to show a government issued photo ID to obtain their student ID number or they may submit a written request to Ad-missions and Records to have the student ID number mailed. Students are responsible for utilizing the same identification number throughout their attendance at WNC. The Social Security number is used to verify the identity of the ap- plicant and as an identifier on student records throughout the enroll-ment periods of the student to accurately record necessary data. As an identifier, the Social Security number is used in program activities such as determining enrollment, recording grades, certifying enrollment verification, generating student transcripts and student fees, and as an identifier for grants, loans and other financial aid programsRESIDENCY DEFINITIONS BONA FIDE NEVADA RESIDENT A bona fide Nevada resident is defined as an independent person who has continuous physical presence in the state of Nevada for a minimum of 12 consecutive months prior to matriculation, who has no ties to any other state and who has the intent to permanently reside in the state of Nevada. In general, an individual is expected to obtain a Nevada driver's license or ID card within 30 days of moving to Nevada to be considered a bona fide resident. For a dependent person, the family, spouse or legal guardian must have physical pres-ence in the state of Nevada for a minimum of 12 consecutive months prior to the student's matriculation, with no ties to any other state, with the intent to permanently reside in Nevada. DATE OF MATRICULATION Date of matriculation is the first day of instruction in the semester or term in which enrollment of a student first occurs (excluding com-munity service courses which are not state funded). This is applicable regardless of the actual start date of a course a student enrolls in. A student has matriculated if he/she enrolls for a course and does not withdraw before the 100% refund period or has a record of previous enrollment at Western Nevada College. DEPENDENT AND FAMILY A dependent is defined as a person who is not financially indepen-dent and is claimed as an exemption for federal income tax purposes under Section 152 of the Internal Revenue Code by another person for the most recent year. Family is defined as natural or legal adoptive parent(s) of a dependent person, or if one parent has legal custody of a dependent person, that parent. NON-RESIDENT A student who is not a bona fide Nevada resident and/or who is not a United States citizen or a Permanent Resident Alien is considered a nonresident and must pay nonresident fees. Only current enrollee or graduates of a Nevada high school may be considered a Nevada resident regardless of citizenship or permanent resident status. RESIDENCY REGULATIONS Regulations for determining Nevada residency for tuition charges are defined in the Board of Regents handbook, Title 4, Chapter 15. One of the following categories must apply in order for an individual to be deemed a Nevada resident:1) A dependent person whose spouse, family or legal guardian is a bona fide resident of the state of Nevada at least 12 consecutive months prior to the student's date of matriculation. 2) A financially independent person who is a bona fide resident of the state of Nevada for at least 12 consecutive months immediately prior to the date of matriculation. The following exceptions can classify a person as a Nevada resident: 1) Current enrollees or graduates of a Nevada high school. 2) A professional or classified employee, postdoctoral fellow, resident physician, or resident dentist of the Nevada System of Higher Education currently employed at least half time, or the spouse or dependent child of such an employee. 3) A graduate student enrolled in the Nevada System of Higher Education and employed by the System in support of its in-structional or research programs, only during the time of such employment.RULES & SANCTIONS 148WESTERN NEVADA COLLEGE 2010-2011 www.wnc.edu4) A member of the Armed Forces of the United States, on active duty, stationed in Nevada as a result of a permanent change of duty sta- tion pursuant to military orders, or a person whose spouse, parent or legal guardian is a member of the Armed Forces of the United States stationed in Nevada as a result of a permanent change of duty station pursuant to military orders, including a Marine cur - rently stationed at the Marine Corps Mountain Warfare Training Center at Pickle Meadows, California. If the member ceases to be stationed in Nevada, reside in Nevada, be stationed in Pickle Meadows, California, or be domiciled in Nevada, the spouse, child or legal guardian of the member shall not be charged tuition if the spouse, child or legal guardian of the member was enrolled prior to the reassignment and remains continuously enrolled at an NSHE institution. 5) A student enrolled in the University Studies Abroad Consortium or in the National Student Exchange Program, only during the period of time of such enrollment. Time spent in Nevada while a student is in the National Student Exchange Program shall not be counted towards satisfying the residence requirement, nor shall enrollment through the Consortium of the Exchange Program be included in the \"date of matriculation\" for evaluation of Nevada residency. 6) Members of federally recognized Native American tribes, who do not otherwise qualify as Nevada residents, and who currently reside on tribal lands located wholly or partially within the bound-aries of the state of Nevada. 7) A financially independent person who has relocated to Nevada for the primary purpose of permanent full-time employment. 8) A financially dependent person whose spouse, family or legal guardian has relocated to Nevada for the primary purpose of permanent full-time employment. 9) A former member of the Armed Forces of the United States who was relocated from Nevada as a result of a permanent change of duty station pursuant to military orders under the following conditions: a) He/She was a resident of Nevada prior to leaving the state as a member of the Armed Forces; and b) He/She maintained his/her Nevada residency while a member of the Armed Forces and c) He/She returns to the state of Nevada within one year of leaving the Armed Forces. 10) Licensed education personnel employed full-time by a public school district in the state of Nevada, or the spouse of dependent child of such an employee. 11 A teacher who is currently employed full-time by a private el- ementary, secondary or postsecondary education institution whose curricula meet the requirements of NRS 394.130, or the spouse or dependent child of such an employee. 12) An alien who has become a Nevada resident by establishing bona fide resident in Nevada and who holds a permanent immigrant visa, or has been granted official asylum or refugee statues, or has been issued a temporary resident alien card, or holds an approved immigration petition as a result of marriage to a U.S citizen. An alien holding another type of visa shall not be classified as a resi-dent student, except as may be required by federal law or court decisions and upon due consideration of evidence of Nevada residence. A student who has been classified as a nonresident who matriculates to WNC shall continue to be classified as a nonresident student throughout the student's enrollment, unless and until the student demonstrates that his or her previous residence has been abandoned and that the student is a Nevada resident. A student must fill out a WNC Residency Reclas-sification Application and provide documentation of: a) continuous physical presence as a Nevada resident for at least 12 months immediately prior to the date of the application for reclassification, and b) evidence of intent to remain a Nevada resident, and c) proof of independent/dependent status. If the student is under 24 and a dependent, documentation of Nevada residency for the student's family, spouse or legal guardian must be provided. If the family, spouse or legal guardian of a dependent student is not a Nevada resident, the student will continue to be classified as a nonresident student. Any person who is classified as an out-of-state student, but who, under these regulations, is eligible for reclassification as an in-state student, shall, upon application and approval, become eligible for such classi-fication at the time of the next registration period. No reclassification under these regulations shall give rise to any claim for refund of tuition already paid to the NSHE. Students who do not qualify for Nevada residency, regardless of time spent in the state of Nevada include dependent students whose family are not residents of Nevada or non-U.S. citizens who do not have a resident alien card or proof of U.S. Citizenship. Students who have enrolled as a Good Neighbor, Children of Alumni or WICHE will not be reclassified as a resident until the student disenrolls from the applicable program and pays full nonresident tuition for at least 12 months for reclassification to resident status or does not take any courses at a NSHE institution for at least 12 months from the time the student moved to Nevada as a bona fide resident. All residency regulations are subject to change by the Board of Regents. Changes become effective for the next semester for all affected students who are not currently classified as in-state residents. DETERMINATION OF STATUS Each institution of the Nevada System of Higher Education affected shall implement these regulations through the Admissions Office at each campus, under the direction of the president. A student may appeal decisions of Admissions and Records concerning his/her status as a resident or nonresident student to a residency appeals appellate board which will consider evidence and make a final determination. The student may appeal the decision to the residency appeals commit-tee within 30 days from the final determination by Admissions and Records. In the event the appeal is not taken within that time, the decision of Admissions and Records shall be final. EXCEPTIONAL CASES In exceptional cases where the applications of these regulations causes an injustice to an individual who technically does not qualify as a resident student but whose status, either because of the residence of the student or his/her family is such as to fall within the general intent of these regulations, then the residency appeals committee shall have the authority to determine that such a student be classified as a resident student. It is the intent of this provision that it applies, only in the infrequent exceptional cases for which a strict application of these regulations results, in the sole judgment of the residency appeals committee, in an obvious injustice. RULES & SANCTIONS 149WESTERN NEVADA COLLEGE 2010-2011 www.wnc.eduSEXUAL HARASSMENT POLICY A. Sexual harassment is illegal under federal and state law. The Ne- vada System of Higher Education (NSHE) is committed to providing a place of work and learning free of sexual harassment. Where sexual harassment is found to have occurred, the NSHE will act to stop the ha-rassment, to prevent its recurrence, and to discipline those responsible in accordance with the NSHE Code or, in the case of classified employ- ees, the Nevada Administrative Code. Sexual harassment is a form of discrimination; it is illegal. No employee or student, either in the workplace or in the aca- demic environment, should be subject to unwelcome verbal or physi-cal conduct that is sexual in nature. Sexual harassment does not refer to occasional compliments of a socially acceptable nature. It refers to behavior of a sexual nature that is not welcome, that is personally of- fensive, and that interferes with performance. It is expected that students, faculty and staff will treat one another with respect. B. Policy applicability and sanctions: All students, faculty, staff and other members of the campus community are subject to this policy. In-dividuals who violate this policy are subject to discipline up to and including termination and/or expulsion, in accordance with the NSHE Code or, in the case of classified employees, the Nevada Administra-tive Code. Other, lesser sanctions may be imposed, depending on the circumstances. This policy is not intended to and does not infringe upon academ- ic freedom in teaching or research as established in the NSHE Code, Chapter 2. C. Training: All employees shall be given a copy of this policy and each institution's Human Resources Office shall maintain documenta-tion that each employee received the policy. New employees shall be given a copy of this policy at the time of hire and each institution's Human Resources Office shall maintain documentation that each new employee received the policy. Each institution shall include this policy and complaint procedure in its general catalog. Each institution shall have an on-going sexual harassment train- ing program for employees. D. Sexual harassment defined: Under this policy, unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, and other visual, verbal or physi-cal conduct of a sexual nature constitute sexual harassment when: 1. Submission to such conduct is made either explicitly or implicitly a term or condition of an individual's employment or academic status; 2. Submission to or rejection of the conduct is used as a basis for aca-demic or employment decisions or evaluations, or permission to par - ticipate in an activity; or 3. The conduct has the purpose or effect of substantially interfering with an individual's academic or work performance, or of creating an intimidating, hostile or offensive environment in which to work or learn. Sexual harassment may take many forms\u2014subtle and indirect, or blatant and overt. For example, It may occur between individuals of the opposite sex or of the same sex. It may occur between students, between peers and/or co- workers, or between individuals in an unequal power relationship. It may be aimed at coercing an individual to participate in an unwanted sexual relationship or it may have the effect of caus- ing an individual to change behavior or work performance. It may consist of repeated actions or may even arise from a single incident if sufficiently severe. It may also rise to the level of a criminal offense, such as battery or sexual assault. Determining what constitutes sexual harassment under this pol- icy will be accomplished on a case by case basis and depends upon the specific facts and the context in which the conduct occurs. Some conduct may be inappropriate, unprofessional, and/or subject to disci-plinary action, but would not fall under the definition of sexual harass-ment. The specific action taken, if any, in a particular instance depends on the nature and gravity of the conduct reported, and may include disciplinary processes as stated above. Examples of unwelcome conduct of a sexual nature that may con- stitute sexual harassment may, but do not necessarily, include, and are not limited to: Physical assault; Sexually explicit statements, comments, questions, jokes, innu endoes, anecdotes, or gestures; Unnecessary touching, patting, hugging, or brushing against a person's body or other inappropriate touching of an individu- al's body; Remarks of a sexual nature about a person's clothing or body; Use of electronic mail or computer dissemination of sexually oriented, sex-based communications; Sexual advances, whether or not they involve physical touch ing; Requests for sexual favors in exchange for actual or promised job or educational benefits, such as favorable reviews, salary increases, promotions, increased benefits, continued employ ment, grades, favorable assignments, letters of recommenda tion; Displaying sexually suggestive objects, pictures, magazines, cartoons, or screen savers; Inquiries, remarks or discussions about an individual's sexual experiences or activities and other written or oral references to sexual conduct. Even one incident, if it is sufficiently serious, may constitute sexual harassment. One incident, however, does not usually constitute sexual harassment. RULES & SANCTIONS 150WESTERN NEVADA COLLEGE 2010-2011 www.wnc.eduE. Procedure: The chancellor and each president shall designate no fewer than two administrators to receive complaints of alleged sexual harassment. The administrators designated to receive the complaints may include the following: (1) the Human Resources officer at the in-stitution; (2) the Affirmative Action Program officer; or (3) any other officer designated by the president. If the Human Resources officer or the Affirmative Action Program officer or another officer designated by the president, is not the individual who initially receives the complaint of alleged sexual harassment, then the individual receiving the com-plaint must immediately forward the complaint to either the Human Resources officer or the Affirmative Action Program officer. An individual filing a complaint of alleged sexual harassment shall have the opportunity to select an independent advisor for assis-tance, support, and advice and shall be notified of this opportunity by the Human Resources officer or the Affirmative Action Program officer, or by their designee. It shall be the choice of the individual filing the complaint to utilize or not utilize the independent advisor. The inde-pendent advisor may be brought into the process at any time at the request of the alleged victim. The means and manner by which an in-dependent advisor shall be made available shall be determined by each institution or unit. Supervisors' responsibilities: Every supervisor has responsibility to take reasonable steps intended to prevent acts of sexual harassment, which include, but are not limited to: Monitoring the work and school environment for signs that ha- rassment may be occurring; Refraining from participation in, or encouragement of actions that could be perceived as harassment (verbal or otherwise); Stopping any observed acts that may be considered harass- ment, and taking appropriate steps to intervene, whether or not the involved individuals are within his/her line of supervision; and Taking immediate action to minimize or eliminate the work and/or school contact between the two individuals where there has been a complaint of harassment, pending investigation. If a supervisor receives a complaint of alleged sexual harassment, or observes or becomes aware of conduct that may constitute sexual harassment, the supervisor must immediately contact one of the indi-viduals identified above to forward the complaint, to discuss it and/or to report the action taken. Failure to take the above action to prevent the occurrence of or stop known harassment may be grounds for disciplinary action. Complaints of sexual harassment must be filed within one hun- dred eighty (180) calendar days after the discovery of the alleged act of sexual harassment with the supervisor, department chair, dean, or one of the administrators listed above and/or designated by the presi- dent to receive complaints of alleged sexual harassment. Complaints of prohibited conduct, including sexual harassment, filed with an institu- tion's administrative officer pursuant to NSHE Code Chapter 6, Section 6.8.1, are not subject to this 180 day filing requirement. 1. Employees: a. An employee who believes that he or she has been subjected to sexual harassment by anyone is encouraged\u2014but it is neither nec-essary nor required\u2014to promptly tell the person that the conduct is unwelcome and ask the person to stop the conduct. A person who receives such a request must immediately comply with it and must not retaliate against the employee for rejecting the conduct. b. The employee may also choose to file a complaint with his or her immediate supervisor, who will in turn immediately contact one of the officials listed above. c. If the employee feels uncomfortable about discussing the incident with the immediate supervisor, the employee should feel free to bypass the supervisor and file a complaint with one of the other listed officials or with any other supervisor. d. After receiving any employee's complaint of an incident of alleged-sexual harassment, whether or not the complaint is in writing, the supervisor will immediately contact any of the individuals listed above to forward the complaint, to discuss it and/or to report the action taken. The supervisor has a responsibility to act even if the individuals involved are not supervised by that supervisor. 2. Students. a. A student who believes that he or she has been subjected to sexual harassment by anyone is encouraged\u2014but it is neither necessary nor required\u2014to promptly tell the person that the conduct is un-welcome and ask the person to stop the conduct. A person who receives such a request must immediately comply with it and must not retaliate against the student for rejecting the conduct. b. The student may also choose to file a complaint with his or her major department chair, who will in turn immediately contact one of the officials listed above. c. If the student feels uncomfortable about discussing the incident with the department chair, the student should feel free to bypass the chair and file a complaint with one of the above officials or to any chair or dean, who will in turn immediately contact one of the officials listed above to forward the complaint, whether or not the complaint is in writing, to discuss it and/or to report the action taken. The chair or dean has a responsibility to act even if the indi-viduals are not supervised by that chair or dean. 3. Non-employees and non-students: Individuals who are neither NSHE employees nor NSHE students and who believe they have been subjected to sexual harassment by a NSHE employee during the em-ployee's work hours or by a NSHE student on campus or at a NSHE-sponsored event may utilize any of the complaint processes set forth above in this section. 4. Investigation and Resolution: a. After receiving a complaint of the incident or behavior, an investi-gation by one of the above listed officials will be initiated to gather information about the incident. Each institution may set guidelines for the manner in which an investigation shall be conducted. b. At the completion of the investigation, a recommendation will be made to the appropriate management regarding the resolution of the matter. The recommendation is advisory only. c. After the recommendation has been made, a determination will be made by appropriate management regarding the resolution of the matter. If warranted, disciplinary action up to and includ-ing involuntary termination or expulsion will be taken. Any such disciplinary action shall be taken in accordance with NSHE Code Chapter 6, or, in the case of classified employees, Nevada Adminis-trative Code, Chapter 284. Other appropriate actions will be taken to correct problems, if any, caused by or contributing to the con-duct. If proceedings are initiated under Chapter 6, the investiga-tion conducted pursuant to this policy may be used as the Chapter 6 investigation. The administrative officer, in his or her discretion, may also supplement the sexual harassment investigation with ad-ditional investigation. RULES & SANCTIONS 151WESTERN NEVADA COLLEGE 2010-2011 www.wnc.edud. After the appropriate management has made a determination re- garding the resolution of the matter, and depending on the circum- stances, both parties may be informed of the resolution. Certain actions made confidential under NSHE Code Chapters 5 and 6 or Nevada Administrative Code, Chapter 284 shall remain confiden- tial. F. Prompt Attention: Complaints of sexual harassment are taken se- riously and will be dealt with promptly. Where sexual harassment is found to have occurred, the NSHE institution or unit where it occurred will act to stop the harassment, to prevent its recurrence, and to disci- pline those responsible. G. Confidentiality: The NSHE recognizes that confidentiality is im-portant. However, confidentiality cannot be guaranteed. The admin- istrators, faculty or staff responsible for implementing this policy will respect the privacy of individuals reporting or accused of sexual ha- rassment to the extent reasonably possible and will maintain confiden-tiality to the extent possible. Examples of situations where confidenti-ality cannot be maintained include, but are not limited to, necessary disclosures during an investigation, circumstances where the NSHE is required by law to disclose information (such as in response to legal process), or when an individual is in harm's way. H. Retaliation: Retaliation against an individual who in good faith complains of alleged sexual harassment or provides information in an investigation about behavior that may violate this policy is against the law, will not be tolerated, and may be grounds for discipline. Retalia-tion in violation of this policy may result in discipline up to and includ-ing termination and/or expulsion. Any employee or student bringing a sexual harassment complaint or assisting in the investigation of such a complaint will not be adversely affected in terms and conditions of employment and/or academic standing, nor discriminated against, ter - minated, or expelled because of the complaint. Intentionally providing false information is also grounds for discipline. \"Retaliation\" may include, but is not limited to, such conduct as: the denial of adequate personnel to perform duties frequent replacement of members of the staff frequent and undesirable changes in the location of an office the refusal to assign meaningful work unwarranted disciplinary action unfair work performance evaluations a reduction in pay the denial of a promotion a dismissal a transfer frequent changes in working hours or workdays an unfair grade an unfavorable reference letter I. Relationship to freedom of expression: The NSHE is committed to the principles of free inquiry and free expression. Vigorous discussion and debate are fundamental rights and this policy is not intended to stifle teaching methods or freedom of expression. Sexual harassment, however, is neither legally protected expression nor the proper exercise of academic freedom; it compromises the integrity of institutions, the tradition of intellectual freedom and the trust placed in the institutions by their members. 152PUBLIC SAFETY The WNC Public Safety Department provides security for the commu-nity.
