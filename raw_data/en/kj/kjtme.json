Aromatherapy is the use of essential oils from plants as a therapy to promote physical and emotional well-being. Aromatherapy can help relieve certain physiological and emotional symptoms including: - Stress - Anxiety - Difficulty sleeping The most important tools required for effective aromatherapy are high-quality essential oils, which are derived directly from natural plants. We provide these oils to patients admitted to the hospital. How do I receive aromatherapy at UK HealthCare? We offer aromatherapy to patients in several inpatient settings, including the UK Gill Heart & Vascular Institute and the UK Markey Cancer Center, among others. If you are admitted to one of the inpatient areas where aromatherapy is offered and are interested in the program, talk to your doctor, nurse or social worker. A nurse will bring the needed supplies to your hospital room and administer the aromatherapy treatment. Our aromatherapy program is also available for use by patients in their own home once they are discharged from the hospital. What happens in an aromatherapy session? The members of our nursing staff who oversee our aromatherapy program have received special training in aromatherapy from nurses who specialize in its research and use. If you are an inpatient who is staying at the hospital, a nurse will consult with you about the symptoms you wish to address and will administer essential oils aimed at alleviating those symptoms. To administer the essential oil, a small amount is placed on a cotton ball, which is waved gently about 6 to 8 inches in front of your nose while you inhale deeply. Once you are discharged from the hospital, you can purchase essential oils in the gift shops at UK HealthCare or at grocery stores that specialize in natural and organic foods and products. How much does an aromatherapy session cost? For patients admitted to the hospital, aromatherapy is included as part of your care. Patients who wish to continue aromatherapy in their own homes after discharge must purchase their own supplies. Schedule an appointment Aromatherapy can also be incorporated into massage. At UK Integrative Medicine & Health, we have a massage therapy program to help with side effects of illness and treatment. To learn more about our massage program or to make an appointment, please "}
