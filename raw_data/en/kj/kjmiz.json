Rabbits develop a tolerance to the pyrogenic action of the toxic somatic antigens of S. typhosa, S. schottmuelleri or Sh. dysenteriae following repeate", "sitename": "American Association of Immunologists", "date": "2023-01-01", "cleaned_text": "Summary Rabbits develop a tolerance to the pyrogenic action of the toxic somatic antigens of S. typhosa, S. schottmuelleri or Sh. dysenteriae following repeated intravenous injections. Animals that have been injected with any of these three preparations showed a diminished febrile response following injection of either of the two heterologous antigens. This tolerance does not appear to be related to the presence of specific circulating antibody. The possible role of this mechanism in typhoid fever is discussed.
