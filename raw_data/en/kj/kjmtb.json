Benefits of vaccination There are many reasons why you are encouraged to get your child vaccinated: - To protect them - although children are at lower risk of serious illness, they are not immune from COVID-19. - To protect others - as we have seen in the ACT, younger people and children experience the highest rates of COVID-19 and one of the biggest spreaders of the virus. Children who are vaccinated are less likely to pass the virus onto others. This means they will protect their family and school community, including those at risk of severe disease of COVID-19. Severe disease from COVID-19, while uncommon in children and adolescents, does occur. The risk is greater for specific groups of children, including those with medical risk factors for severe illness, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children, as well as children living in crowded conditions or outbreak areas. Vaccination is a safe and effective way to help protect your child from severe illness from COVID-19. - Less disruption from school - being vaccinated will make your child less likely to experience disruption from school, socialising with others and other activities they love. Getting vaccinated will also reduce the likelihood of outbreaks in school communities and the need for them to quarantine. COVID-19 vaccines for children are voluntary and not mandatory. If you are unsure about vaccination for your child, please speak to your GP, or another trusted health professional, to make an informed decision about their health. An information resource and consent form is also available for parents and guardians of children on the [ Australian Government Department of Health and Aged Care website](https://www.health.gov.au/resources/publications/covid-19-vaccination-pfizer-information-and-consent-form-for-parents-and-guardians-of-children-aged-5-to-11-years). This resource outlines more information on why you should get your child vaccinated, including risks and benefits of getting vaccinated. Should my child get vaccinated if they've already had COVID-19? Children who have previously had COVID-19 can receive the suitable COVID-19 vaccine for their age group. While they may have some natural immunity after being infected, the protection gained varies from person to person. It's not yet clear how long any natural immunity might last for. Getting the COVID-19 vaccine will help protect them against getting infected with COVID-19 again or passing it onto someone else. If you have questions about the best timing, we recommend you talk to a GP or health care provider for advice. Providing consent Parents and guardians are asked to accompany their child, aged 6 months to 11 years, to provide consent for their child's vaccination. In general, a parent or legal guardian of a child has the authority to consent to vaccination. In some states and territories, older adolescents may be able to provide their own consent. More information about consent is available in the [Australian Immunisation Handbook](https://immunisationhandbook.health.gov.au/vaccination-procedures/preparing-for-vaccination). An information resource and consent form has been developed by the Australian Government Department of Health and Aged Care for: [parents and guardians of children aged 6 months to 5 years](https://www.health.gov.au/resources/publications/covid-19-vaccination-moderna-information-and-consent-form-for-parents-and-guardians-of-children-aged-6-months-to-5-years) [parents and guardians of children aged 5 to 11 years](https://www.health.gov.au/resources/publications/covid-19-vaccination-pfizer-information-and-consent-form-for-parents-and-guardians-of-children-aged-5-to-11-years) This resource outlines more information on why you should get your child vaccinated, including risks and benefits of getting vaccinated. Vaccination records Your child's COVID-19 vaccinations will be recorded on their Immunisation History Statement. If your child is aged 14 years and older, you can no longer access their Australian Immunisation Record for privacy reasons. However, you can get their immunisation history statement if you have their consent. More information is available on the [Services Australia website](https://www.servicesaustralia.gov.au/how-to-get-immunisation-history-statement?context=22436).
