Eastern Medicine approaches the body in a holistic manner. As is the case with all traditional medicine systems, this is based on the philosophy that all the body's organs and energies are connected. Learn Harmony & Balance Students enrolled in this course will learn how to harmonize subtle energy patterns in themselves and with the environment in which they live in order to reach and maintain optimal health. You will learn about traditional Ayurvedic and Chinese diagnosis and treatment methods, thus giving you two ways you can approach health in a holistic manner. Ayurveda is based on the system of the tridoshas - vata, pitta and kapha. Traditional Chinese Medicine (often abbreviated to TCM) focuses on the energies of the seasons, elements and organs. Both therapies aim to create harmony and balance in a person's body. In this course, you will develop an understanding of why these ancient medical theories are still as relevant now as they were thousands of years ago; how both of these medical theories can detect imbalances and correct them through appropriate lifestyle modifications in order to prevent and cure diseases. Course Outline What You Will Learn - Anatomy and physiology - The three doshas - The three gunas - Five element theory - Yin and yand - Chinese meridians - Herbal preparations - Tongue and pulse diagnosis - Diagnosis & restoration of physical and energetic imbalances through diet and lifestyle modifications Learning Outcomes Upon completion of this course, you will have a basic grounding in the philosophy and practice of Ayurvedic and Chinese Medicine. With the ancient knowledge gained from this course you will be able to educate your clients, friends and family on how to follow the laws of nature to achieve harmony with oneself and the environment. Complementary Courses This is an intensive course on two ancient philosophies and traditions that can be used separately or in combination with each other. The courses are designed to make you a more holistically minded health practitioner. The Ayurvedic and Traditional Chinese Medicine course is one of five sections of our Holistic Naturopathy Certificate course. Completing the Ayurvedic and Traditional Chinese Medicine course will also give you credit if you want to go on to complete our Naturopathic program. Please note if you are planning to practice in Australia that the use of certain terms like Chinese Medicine Practitioner and Chinese Herbal Medicine Practitioner are regulated by the Chinese Medicine Board. This course will not enable you to use those terms or become a registered practitioner because it does not include clinical components and any questions should be referred to the board.

Eastern Medicine FAQ No. In Australia, Traditional Chinese Medicine is a registered profession, requiring a four-year government accredited course in order to use certain titles or in any way describe yourself as a Chinese medicine practitioner. The law is quite strict in this regard, so we recommend that our students either complete this course for personal development, as part of the [Certificate of Naturopathy](https://www.raynormassage.com/courses/diploma-of-naturopathy-course/) or practice as an Ayurvedic or Eastern Lifestyle Consultant.

You may refer to your notes and books to assist you with your assignments. These assignments are designed to be simple and concise, and to ensure that you have read and properly understood the information before you counsel others.
