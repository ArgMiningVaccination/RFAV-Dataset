Consequently, additional immunization strategies are considered to reduce the burden of disease. The aim of this study is to design an individual-based stochastic dynamic framework to model pertussis transmission in the population in order to predict the epidemiologic and economic consequences of theimplementation of universal booster vaccination programs. Using this framework, we estimate the cost-effectiveness of universal adolescent pertussis booster vaccination at the age of 12 years in the Netherlands. Methods/Principal Findings: We designed a discrete event simulation (DES) model to predict the epidemiological and economic consequences of implementing universal adolescent booster vaccination. We used national age-specificnotification data over the period 1996-2000\u2014corrected for underreporting\u2014to calibrate the model assuming a steadystate situation. Subsequently, booster vaccination was introduced. Input parameters of the model were derived from literature, national data sources (e.g. costing data, incidence and hospitalization data) and expert opinions. As there is no consensus on the duration of immunity acquired by natural infection, we considered two scenarios for this duration ofprotection (i.e. 8 and 15 years). In both scenarios, total pertussis incidence decreased as a result of adolescent vaccination. From a societal perspective, the cost-effectiveness was estimated 8- and 15-year protection scenarios, respectively. Sensitivity analyses revealed that the outcomes are most sensitive to the quality of life weights used for pertussis disease. Conclusions/Significance: To our knowledge we designed the first individual-based dynamic framework to model pertussis transmission in the population. This study indicates that adolescent pertussis vaccination is likely to be a cost-effective intervention for The Netherlands. The model is suited to investigate further pertussis booster vaccination strategies. Citation: de Vries R, Kretzschmar M, Schellekens JFP, Versteegh FGA, Westra TA, et al.

It is caused by the bacteria Bordetella pertussis ,a n d occasionally, Bordetella parapertussis . Before the introduction of vaccination programs, pertussis was a main cause of child morbidity and mortality in developed countries. After the introduction of routine vaccination programs the incidence of pertussis decreased to very low levels. However, during the past decade the incidence has again shown an increasing trend in many developed countries with a shift in the incidence towards older age groups [1]. Despite a high vaccination coverage ( <96%) a clear increase in the incidence of pertussis was also apparent in the Netherlands from1996 onwards [2-4]. This increase is most marked in adolescents and adults. This is of concern as adolescents and adults have been identified as a major source of transmission of pertussis to very young yet unimmunized and only partly immunized infants, inwhom pertussis causes serious morbidity and mortality [5,6]. Aspertussis infections often go by unnoticed in adolescents and adults,partly because the disease is often misdiagnosed in these age groupsby clinicians and partly as many infections remain asymptomatic, the actual incidence in this age group probably is much larger due to underreporting [7,8]. Although pertussis is not generally recognizedas a serious problem beyond childhood, it can cause significantmorbidity and costs in adolescents and adults with productivitylosses comprising the largest costs [9,10]. PLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 October 2010 | Volume 5 | Issue 10 | e13392In recent years, acellular vaccines have been replacing whole cell vaccines in many developed countries [1,11]. These acellular vaccines are less reactogenic, improving their safety profile. In theNetherlands, until 2001, the vaccination schedule consisted of four doses of the whole cell pertussis vaccine (currently at 2, 3, 4 months of age and a booster vaccination at 11 months of age).From 2001 onwards, an additional booster vaccination (acellular vaccine) is given to four year old children to reduce the incidence. Moreover, from 2005, the four whole cell vaccinations givenwithin the first year of life have been replaced by the acellular vaccine [12]. Vaccine-induced immunity is known to be of relatively short duration ( ,8 years), after either immunization with whole cell or acellular vaccines [13,14]. Considering the fact that thus adolescents and adults are a major reservoir for pertussistransmission to very young infants, addition of immunization strategies to the current childhood program to decrease the incidence in adolescents or adults may be considered. A decreasein the pertussis incidence in adolescents or adults may be expected to lead to an increase in herd immunity that in turn indirectly results in an increased protection of young vulnerable infants[5,15]. Currently, several countries (e.g. Germany, France, Canada, Australia) have already incorporated an adolescent booster dose (acellular vaccine) into their immunization program[1,16]. The main goal of this paper is to design an individual-based stochastic dynamic framework to model the pertussis transmissionin the population in order to predict the epidemiologic and economic consequences of the implementation of universal booster vaccination programs. Using this framework, we currentlyestimate the cost-effectiveness of universal adolescent pertussis booster vaccination at the age of 12 years in the Netherlands. Methods In this section we elaborate on the individual-based dynamic model and the data used for the cost-effectiveness analysis. In general, the model consists of a dynamic epidemiologic part andan economic part. In particular, the epidemiologic part can be used for estimating the impact of an universal booster vaccination strategy on the incidence and prevalence of pertussis in thepopulation. Specifically, here, it was used for estimating the epidemiologic consequences of adolescent booster vaccination in the Netherlands. The economic part addresses the avertedcomplications, associated costs and the cost analysis of theadolescent booster vaccination. Both models were linked by using the output of the epidemiologic part as input for the economic analysis to estimate cost-effectiveness. Dynamic Epidemiologic Model We designed a discrete event simulation (DES) model to model pertussis transmission in the population [17-19]. Contrary to deterministic SIR (Susceptible-Infected-Recovered) models, which are often used to model infectious diseases, within a DES-modelindividual persons are modeled rather than cohorts [17-19,20]. Furthermore, a fundamental aspect of DES is time which advances in 'discrete' jumps; for every individual the time untilthe next event happens is determined and the simulation proceeds along a chain of events [17-19]. A schematic representation of the possible individual pathways within the designed pertussis DES-model is shown in Figure 1. We developed a model that distinguishes between three types of infections: infections in immunologically naive individuals (i.e. primary infections), infections in individuals whose immune systemhas been primed before by vaccination or infection (i.e. recidive infections), and asymptomatic infections (note that all primary andrecidive infections were assumed to be symptomatic). Allindividuals are born susceptible after which they run the risk ofacquiring a pertussis infection after contact with an infectiousperson. After infection, individuals recover and become immune.Immunity wanes over time. We divided immunity into two types:full immunity (i.e. immunity against infection and disease), andpartial immunity (i.e. immunity against disease only). In particular,although a partial immune individual is able to acquire aninfection and subsequently transmit the pathogen to otherindividuals in the population, the partial immune individual willnot become ill (i.e. only experiences asymptomatic infection).Furthermore, we assumed that if a partial immune, or susceptible,individual comes into contact with the pathogen by eithervaccination or infection, the person will become full immuneagain through this next priming of the immune system. The DES-model was built in Arena H[21]. Model Parameters Although the duration of the infectious period is not precisely known and probably varies widely, it likely depends on the severityof the disease. Based on expert opinions, we assumed that themean period which an individual with pertussis is infectious lasts 4weeks for primary infected cases, 3 weeks for recidive infectedcases and 1 week for asymptomatic cases. We assumed that childhood vaccination as well as adolescent vaccination has influence on the level of immunity of both partialimmune and susceptible individuals. As a result of vaccination,both groups were assumed to become immune against bothdisease and infection (Figure 1). The vaccination coverage in theNetherlands is about 96% for infants and the same was assumedfor adolescents. In the model we divided the vaccination schemeinto three parts: (i) the vaccinations at 2, 3, 4 and 11 months ofage; (ii) the booster dose at 4 years of age; and (iii) a booster inadolescents at 12 years of age. In reality immunity aftervaccination is gradually built up after each vaccination dosewithin the first year of life. However, for simplicity, with regard tothe immunization within the first year we assumed that a certainfraction of the population (i.e. coverage 6efficacy) is effectively protected precisely after 4 months (i.e. 1 month after the secondvaccination at 3 months of age). Before the implementation of the acellular booster vaccination at the age of 4 years, the efficacy of the whole cell pertussis vaccineused in the Netherlands was estimated at 89% [2,22-25]. Thisestimate was based on observational data from the Netherlands, inparticular national notification reports, during the period when inthe Netherlands a locally-produced whole-cell vaccine was used(manufacturer: National Institute of Public Health/NetherlandsVaccine Institute). Since 2001, acellular vaccines have beenintroduced in the Dutch Immunization Program, based on anadvice by the Dutch Health Council that efficacy of these vaccineswould not be inferior to those of the whole-cell vaccine and asuperior safety profile of the acellular products [26]. In particular,5-component acellular pertussis vaccines are currently used in theNetherlands for infants (Pediacel (R)and Infanrix-hexa(R)) and for boostering at age of 4 (Infanrix-IPV(R)). These multi- component ( $3 components) vaccines have a higher efficacy than one- and two-component acellular vaccines and have not beenassessed inferior to the best whole cell vaccines on a statisticallysignificant level [27,28]. Based on clinical trial data the efficacy ofan acellular adolescent booster vaccine for adolescents was alsoestimated at a quite similar level [29-31]. Therefore, in the modelwe assumed the same efficacy at 89% for vaccination within thePertussis Vaccination PLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 2 October 2010 | Volume 5 | Issue 10 | e13392first year, booster vaccination at 4 years of age and booster vaccination at 12 years of age. The duration of protection aftervaccination is discussed below ( seeScenarios section). In general, the most important term in a dynamic model would be the so-called force of infection (FOI). The FOI denotes the rateat which susceptible individuals acquire an infection [20]. Here weused the method developed by van Boven et al [23] to estimate theage-dependent FOI from age-specific incidence data. Theadvantage of that method is that the estimation procedure isbased on the underlying model structure. Furthermore, it ispossible to take the waning immunity and different types ofinfection consistently into account. For the estimation of the age- specific FOI we had to assume a stable age distribution and an endemic equilibrium (i.e. steady state). We divided the populationin 86 age classes; 74 yearly classes (1-74 years) and the first yearseparated into monthly classes (0-11 months). We assumed anendemic equilibrium from 1996 to 2000. Therefore, we averagedthe case notification data from the Netherlands over those years toobtain the age-specific steady state incidences and prevalences[32]. Subsequently, these numbers were corrected for underreport- ing. Previously, de Melker et al estimated that, in the Netherlands,the true incidence was approximately 660 times higher than thereported incidence for children and adults [33]. We used the agespecific ratios of estimated numbers to notified numbers forcorrecting the age-specific incidences [33]. We note that in realitythere probably was no endemic equilibrium from 1996 to 2000[32], but for correctly analyzing the effects of different immuni-zation strategies a steady state situation has to be assumed in orderto discard the time dependence in the incidence and prevalence. The set of differential equations used for estimating the age-specific FOI is given in Appendix S1. For a full description of the methodology we refer to van Boven et al [23]. The FOI is a function of the number of infectious individuals at a given point in time, the contact function and the transmissioncoefficients. Here, the age specific FOI is given by: primary infected, recidive infected and asymptomatically infected individuals,respectively. The contact function (C(a,a 9)) is a 86 686 matrix representing the number of contacts between an individual inage-group awith an individual in age-group a9per unit of time. We used the contact matrix for respiratory diseases for the Dutchpopulation estimated by Wallinga et al [34,35]. The transmis-sion coefficient ( b) represents the probability that a contact between a susceptible individual of age awith an infectious individual of age a9leads to transmission. We assumed different transmission probabilities concerning the different types ofinfection, with b 1(a):b2(a):b3(a) = 1:0.7:0.05. I.e. the more severe the disease the higher the probab ility of transmission. Further- more, we assumed that the transm ission probability depends on the age of the susceptible individual. The age-specific transmis-sion parameters were estimated f rom the estimated age specific FOI, the contact matrix and the age specific steady state prevalence. Ergo, the transmission coefficients were used to calibrate the model on the assumed age-specific steady stateprevalences. Figure 1.

A recent review on the duration of immunity afternatural infection revealed estimates of protection varying from 4 to 20 years [13]. Accordingly, we considered two scenarios that differ in the duration of immunity after a natural pertussis infection. In scenario 1 we assumed that immunity on average wanes after 15 years (R n= 15), where individuals were fully and partially protected for 2 and 13 years, respectively. In scenario 2, we assumed that immunity on average wanes after 8 years (R n= 8), where individuals were fully and partially protected for 2 and 6 years, respectively. The duration of immunity acquired by vaccination did not differ between both scenarios at 8 years. For both scenarios the situation in which a pertussis adolescent booster vaccination would be implemented was compared to the current situation without adolescent booster vaccination. Simula- tions were performed for a population of 150,000 individuals with a uniform age distribution (i.e. the age classes were equally sized). The population size was stabilized with newborns who enter themodel exactly balancing the people who leave the model due to death. Type 1 mortality was assumed as this is generally a reasonable approximation for developed countries [20]. In particular, we assumed that everybody lives to 75 years of age and dies thereafter. To mimic reality, at the start of the simulation (t = 0) a booster vaccination at the age of 4 years is implemented in the model. Subsequently, for assessing the impact of an adolescent booster dose, after 10 years (t = 10) an extra vaccination at the age of 12years is implemented in the model. Hereafter, a period of another 15 year was chosen for analyzing the impact of the adolescent booster vaccination on the pertussis incidence and prevalence in the population. This means that a total time horizon of 25 years was used. Obviously, when assessing the outcomes over 25 years of the current situation, no booster vaccination at t = 10 was implemented in the model. The parameter values used in thestochastic model for both scenarios are shown in Table 1. Because the model is stochastic, multiple simulation runs were performedfor both scenarios in order to capture the uncertainty in the results. Economic Model The output of the dynamic model, in terms of annual primary, recidive and asymptomatic infections, was used to estimate the economic consequences of the implementation of the adolescent booster vaccination program. In particular, the different types ofinfections were linked to associated resource use and subsequent costs. We considered the following costs: (i) vaccination costs (i.e. vaccine price and administration costs); (ii) direct medical costsassociated with diagnosis, therapy and possible length of hospital stay; and (iii) indirect costs due to productivity losses. All costs were reported in J's at 2008 price levels. If there were no cost estimates available for 2008 we converted them to 2008 prices using gross domestic product deflators [36]. The vaccination costs included the vaccine price and the administration costs. One dose of the acellular pertussis vaccine registered for the use in infants costs J18.30 [37]. As the price for the accellular adolescent booster vaccine was not available at thattime we assumed a price of J18.30 for the adolescent booster vaccine as well. Furthermore, the vaccine administration costs were assumed at J6. Summarizing, the total vaccination costs aggregated at J24.30 per individual. The direct medical costs included costs associated with diagnostic procedures, antibiotic treatment and hospital stay. We assumed that these direct medical costs differ between notified and unnotified cases. For estimating the age specific proportion ofnotified cases per type of infection (i.e. I 1,I2and I 3) the age specific steady state ratios I 1:I2:I3(where underreporting was taken into account) together with the age specific notification data (from 1996to 2000) were used. First, we assumed that notified persons suffered from a primary pertussis infection. Subsequently, if the incidence of notified cases exceeded the incidence of primaryinfections, the remainder was assumed to suffer from a recidive infection. Obviously, all asymptomatic infections were assumed to be unnotified. The age- and infection-type specific reporting rates Table 1.

The expert panel | www.plosone.org 4 October 2010 | Volume 5 | Issue 10 | e13392are shown in Appendix S1 (Table B1). Furthermore, the age- and infection-type specific hospitalization rates were estimated using data on pertussis related hospital admissions obtained from the Dutch Prismant-database [38]. The estimation procedure of the hospitalization rates was similar to that of the reporting rates; weassumed that hospitalized persons suffered from a primary pertussis infection and, if the incidence of hospitalizations exceeded the incidence of primary infections, the remainder was assumed to suffer from a recidive infection. The exact hospitalization rates are shown in Appendix S1 (Table C1). Furthermore, national data on pediatric intensive care stays revealed that 5.93% and 1.82% of the pertussis relatedhospital admissions lead to intensive care stays for infants at the age of 0 and 1 years respectively (data obtained from the national PICU registry). The age-specific mean lengths of stay of the pertussis-related hospital admissions are shown in Appendix S1 (Table C2). The average costs of a pediatric intensive care stay were assumed at J5000 per admission plus an extra cost of J1500 per day (data obtained from the VU University Medical Centre in Amsterdam, the Netherlands). The average daily costs for a regular (i.e. standard care) stay were estimated at J367 [39]. Of the notified pertussis cases who were not hospitalized a certain fraction was assumed to be treated ambulatory by a medical specialist (e.g. pediatrician or lung specialist). As young infants and elderly are most likely to be treated ambulatory we assumed that these fractions were age dependent (Appendix S1; Table C3). Resources used by all persons treated in or admitted to the hospital were assumed to include: (i) 2 diagnostic laboratorytests (which contained 1 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test and 1 serology test); (ii) chest radiography; (iii) (C-reactive protein); (iv) blood concentration determination (e.g. leukocyte count); and (v) antibiotic treatment with azithromycin. We assumed that those persons additionally had on average one general practitioner (GP) visit and three specialist visits. Further- more, the remainder of the notified cases was assumed to incur 2GP visits together with one course of azithromycin treatment. For those we assumed that 83%, 4% and 13% were diagnosed by means of serology, culture and PCR (data obtained from Infectious Diseases Laboratory Groningen, the Netherlands). All medical costs are shown in Table 2. Our analysis was performed using the societal perspective; both the direct medical costs (irrespective of reimbursement issues) andthe indirect costs of production losses were included in the analysis. Tormans et al reported, based on replies from pediatricians, that one of the parents would be absent of work for approximately 10 days while a child was suffering from pertussis [40]. We used this estimate for children below the age of one, irrespective of infection type and notification status. Conservatively, the mother was assumed to care for the child (or adolescent). Moreover, in general,if a person is hospitalized, the mean length of stay period was added to the estimate. However, we did not include productivity losses for children aged 0 to 3 months because of the maternity leave entitled to new mothers. For notified children aged 1 to 9 years we assumed a work absence of 6 days by one of the parents as reported by Lee et al [41]. For this group (and adolescents and adults) we assumed that unreported cases result in half of theproductivity losses. The time missed from work due to a pertussis infection in adolescents and adults has been estimated by Lee et al [9]. For adolescents (10-19 years) they estimated a mean work loss of 1.03 days for one of the parents. However, for adolescents aged 15 to 17 years we assumed a work loss of 2.65 days for those adolescents that work themselves [9]. Finally, we assumed that adults miss a mean of 5.98 days of work [9]. Note that we did notdistinguish productivity losses between primary and recidiveinfections as the estimates extracted from the literature apply to reported cases regardless of infection type [9,40,41]. Obviously, wedid not include productivity losses for asymptomatic infected persons in the analysis. Subsequently, the friction cost method was used to monetarily value the indirect costs [42,43]. Here, we took both the national unemployment and the elasticity of absence from work related to productivity (i.e. 0.8 for the Netherlands) into account [39,44]. Allage-specific estimates of productivity losses and associated indirectcosts are shown in Table 3. Cost-Effectiveness Analysis The incremental cost-effectiveness was estimated for of a pertussis booster vaccination program aimed at adolescentscompared to the current situation (i.e. no adolescent pertussis vaccination). Cost-effectiveness was expressed as net costs per quality adjusted life year (QALY). Hence, we linked qualityweights to the complications related to pertussis infections. Most ofthe utilities used here were extracted from the only published studyon preferences in adults or parents of children with pertussis illness [45]. If no utilities were available, reasonable figures were assumed (Table 4). In the baseline analysis, we assumed that hospitalized,reported and unreported cases suffer from severe cough, moderatecough and mild cough, respectively. Pertussis illness in infants aged,1 years of age was always assumed severe. Estimates for the mean durations of pertussis illness were obtained from available data [45,46]: (i) 80 days for infants aged ,1 year; (ii) 56 days for children aged 1-9 years; (iii) 74 days for adolescents; and (iv) 87days for adults. As the severity of pertussis disease wanes over timewe assumed that adults did not have be off work the full period,either to take care of their ill child or because of their own illness. Consequently, the full period over which quality of life losses occurTable 2. Direct medical costs used as inputs for the economic model (2008 euros).

According to the Dutch guidelines future health outcomes and future costs were discounted at 1.5% and 4%, respectively [47]. Sensitivity analysis To further test the robustness of the outcomes we performed a univariate sensitivity analysis on various parameters in the economic model. For example, the inclusion of universal pertussis vaccination in the Dutch national immunization program would probably result in a decline in vaccine price due to large scale purchase. Therefore, we estimated the cost-effectiveness with a vaccine price of J10 instead of J18.30 used in the baseline analysis. As, to our knowledge, only one study explicitly measured the decrease of quality of life due to pertussis disease, we varied this parameter in sensitivity analysis [45]. Here, we assessed the effecton the outcomes if the quality weights were both decreased and increased by 10%. Furthermore, we investigated the effect of varying work loss on the cost-effectiveness. Firstly, we estimated the effect of a 10% increase and 10% decrease on the results. Furthermore, weassessed the cost-effectiveness when the indirect costs were fully omitted from the analysis. Finally, we explored the impact of different discount rates on the outcomes. In particular, health outcomes were discounted at a rateof 4% according to the former Dutch guidelines for pharmacoe-conomic research [48]. Furthermore, the effect of no discountingfor both costs and health outcomes was investigated. Results Figure 2 shows the estimated age-dependent FOI. The FOI is estimated to be low in the very young age classes and it reaches apeak in adults after which it decreases again in the oldest ageclasses. This indicates that adults are at the highest risk ofacquiring a pertussis infection. Quantitatively, as the period of fullimmunity after either vaccination or natural infection is similar inboth scenarios (i.e. 2 years), the age-dependent FOI is equal forboth scenarios investigated. The implementation of an adolescent pertussis booster vacci- nation program (technically, at t = 10) reduces the absoluteincidence of all infection types (I 1,I1and I 3) in the total population as shown in Figure 3. In particular, the figure represents the meanoutcomes for the scenario where natural immunity is assumed towane over 15 years. The decreasing trend in incidence is alsoobserved for the other scenario with 8 years of protection (notshown). Note that although the overall incidence in the populationwas equal in the steady situation for both scenarios, the differencein duration of immunity led to different steady state ratios ofI 1:I2:I3(i.e. the ratio of symptomatic versus asymptomatic cases differed in both scenarios). The relative decrease in incidence ismost apparent for primary pertussis infections. Furthermore, notethe relative large decrease in primary infections due to the boostervaccination at the age of 4 years (technically, implemented att = 0). The age-specific outcomes per infection type are shown inTable 5. Highest percentage reductions in symptomatic infections(i.e. I 1and I 2) are seen in the adolescent age groups (i.e. 10-19 years) and in younger age groups (i.e. 4-9 years) for I 3. For infants aged below 1 year, 10-20% of primary infections is estimated tobe averted. Although the total number of recidive infectionsdeclines due to adolescent booster vaccination, the incidence in theolder age classes increases slightly. Ergo, adolescent vaccinationcauses a relative slight age shift for recidive infections.Table 3. Productivity losses (days) and associated indirect costs (J2008) per pertussis case.

The indirect costs dueto productivity losses comprise by far the largest part of the costs associated with pertussis diseases. Specifically, the indirect costs show an increase in the older age groups (i.e. age $20 years) as a result of the adolescent pertussis vaccination. Furthermore, thevaccination costs over a 15-year period are estimated at J540.000. Consequently, the incremental cost-effectiveness of adolescent pertussis vaccination is the scenario with 8 and 15 years protection after natural infection, respectively. Finally, table 7 presents the results of the univariate sensitivity analysis. Except a 10% increase in quality weights, changes adopted in the cost- en health-related parameters had limitedeffect on the cost-effectiveness. Discussion In this paper we present the first dynamic individual-based approach to model pertussis transmission in the population.Furthermore, we applied this model to estimate the cost- effectiveness of a universal adolescent booster vaccination program for the Dutch situation. Until now, almost all cost-effectiveness analyses of pertussis vaccination programs previously performeduse standard decision analytic models to assess the effects ofvaccination [40,46,49-62]. However, as pertussis is a transmissibleinfectious disease, a dynamic model is required to fully take intoaccount the spread of the disease over time in the population[20,63]. Although van Boven et al [23,64] and Hethcote [65-69]used a dynamic approach to model pertussis transmission, thesemodels were not used for economic analyses. So far, onlyEdmunds et al [70] designed a dynamic model to estimate thecost-effectiveness of pertussis booster vaccination in England andWales. Our model differs from the dynamic models designed byvan Boven, Hethcote and Edmunds in that those population-based whereas ours is stochastic andindividual-based [23,64-70]. In general, reliable and currently valid pertussis related FOI estimates are difficult to obtain. Previously used estimates are mostly based on incidence data from England and Wales beforethe introduction of widespread vaccination [20,65,71]. Theseestimates may however not describe the current situation in theNetherlands. Moreover the methods used to estimate these age-specific FOIs has a number of drawbacks as described by vanBoven et al [23]. As van Boven et al attempted to overcome thesedrawbacks in their approach, we used the method they [23]developed to consistently take the waning of immunity anddifferent types of infection into account to estimate age-specificFOIs for the Dutch situation. We note that, unlike the stochasticindividual-based dynamic framework to model the pertussistransmission in the population, the approach used to estimatethe age-specific FOIs was deterministic. However, as the structureof both models and the parameter values used, after convertingfrom rates to probabilities, were similar, we felt this approachcould be justified. The FOI estimated in this study differs from those previously estimated for the Netherlands and England and Wales in terms ofboth magnitude and shape [20,23,65,71]. The age-specific FOIsestimated in this study are consistently higher than those estimatedby Grenfell and Anderson [71] and van Boven et al [23]. This isdue to the fact that we, contrary to others, corrected the incidencenumbers for occurrence of asymptomatic infections and underre-porting. Consequently, the number of infectious people in theTable 6. Mean age-specific outcomes* in terms of costs and QALYs.

Furthermore, the difference in shape can be explained by different levels of underreporting for different age-classes [33]. In particular, the underreporting rate is much higher in the older age-classes compared to infants. According our DES-model, the incremental cost-effectiveness of adolescent pertussis booster vaccination is estimated belowJ10,000 per QALY for both scenarios investigated and in a wide range of sensitivity analyses. The cost-effectiveness would be slightly more favorable if the duration of immunity after natural infection is 8 years (ICER: J4418 per QALY) compared to 15 years (ICER: J6371 per QALY). This is mainly due to the greater amount of QALYs that can be gained by vaccination when the duration of immunity after natural infection is ''only'' 8 years. Obviously, the shorter the duration of immunity after natural infection (i.e. the faster one becomes susceptible again), the higher the risk of acquiring a symptomatic infection will be. In particular, more recidive infections and associated quality of life loss can be averted in the individuals aged 10-19 years old. Although adolescent vaccination leads to a decrease in total incidence of pertussis in the population, it caused an increase in absolute numbers of recidive infections in the older age groups (.20 years). Consequently, the total indirect costs increased as a result of adolescent vaccination because the productivity losses arehighest in these age classes. Furthermore, the direct medical costs also increased in adults due to the increase in recidive infections in these individuals. This particularly stresses the importance of using a dynamic approach instead of a static one when estimating the cost-effectiveness of pertussis booster vaccination strategies as static models are not able to predict these age shifts. Obviously, the age shift modeled here slightly worsens the cost-effectiveness of adolescent vaccination. Although it is often thought that the inclusion of herd-immunity effects can only have beneficial effects, they can be detrimental as well, as previously also noticed by Brisson et al [72]. Here, we will discuss a possible explanation for the increase in recidive infections in adults. First, the total incidence in the vaccinated age groups will decrease as a result of vaccination. Subsequently, this will lead to a decrease of the infection pressure in the population (i.e. the probability of contacting an infectious individual will decrease). Ergo, the probability of becomingsusceptible again will increase for individuals. Consequently, the ratio of symptomatic versus asymptomatic cases will change in favor of the symptomatic cases. Accordingly, although the total incidence decreased, in this analysis, under these baseline assumptions, this resulted in an absolute increase of symptomatic cases in the adult groups. However, the exact effects of adolescent vaccination on the relative and absolute incidences will obviously depend on the underlying assumptions. For example, assuming no infectiousness for asymptomatically infected persons could possibly result in an unintended increase of incidence in young infants if the absolute number of symptomatic cases increases in adults. However, on the contrary, the cost-effectiveness could possibly become more favorable if the infectiousness of asymptomatic cases is increased relatively to that of symptomatic cases. This is certainly an area for further research. Univariate sensitivity analyses revealed that varying discount rates and parameters associated with cost measures had limitedeffect on the cost-effectiveness. Regarding quality of life measures only an increase of 10% in the quality weights for pertussis illness showed a considerable effect (i.e. increase) on the ICER. However, such a large increase in quality weights would be rather unrealistic as the increased weights, especially in adoles-cents and adults, approach one (i.e. perfect health) which would mean that pertussis illness would hardly influence the quality oflife of an individual. All previously performed cost-effectiveness analyses using a static approach showed potential favourable cost-effectiveness foradolescent pertussis booster vaccination [49,59,60,61,73]. Isked-jian et al [59] even estimated that vaccination of 14-year oldadolescents in Ontario (Canada) could be a cost-saving strategyfrom a societal viewpoint. However, these studies were not able tofully capture the herd-immunity effects as that would require adynamic approach. The only cost-effectiveness analysis based on adynamic model, performed by Edmunds et al [70], reported morereserved conclusions. In particular, they estimated that theintroduction of a booster at 4 years is possibly more cost-effectivethan the implementation of an adolescent vaccination program inthe UK [70]. This immediately stresses another difficulty incomparing the outcomes of different cost-effectiveness analyses.The effects of adolescent booster vaccination on the epidemiologyand cost-effectiveness will differ among different countries as thereis a lot of variability in national vaccination policies [1,74]. Forexample, in the Netherlands booster vaccination for 4-year oldswas indeed actually recently introduced and was present in all ourstrategies, rather than serving as an alternative. Furthermore, itdepends on the exact organization of the current national immunization schedule what will be the best timing of vaccinating adolescents. There are several limitations of our study. The main disadvantage of the current version of the model is the runningtime. Although ideally one wants, to fully capture all variability inthe outcomes, to run a stochastic model many (e.g. 10,000) times,this was not fully possible here within a reasonable time.Consequently, we were able to run the model only a few times.However, this limited number of replications also already showsinsight in the uncertainty surrounding the cost-effectiveness. In thissituation (i.e. 20 runs per scenario) the incremental cost-effectiveness never exceeded the J10,000 per QALY for both scenarios which makes it plausible that the expected cost-effectiveness is very likely below this value. Also, deaths from pertussis were conservatively not taken into account as on average less than one death per year was reportedover the last decade in the Netherlands [44]. However, from othercountries we do know that there is potential underreporting ofpertussis related deaths [75,76]. Although different nationalsurveillance systems are often not comparable, underreporting ofdeaths probably also exists in the Netherlands. This is because ofthe difficulty in defining pertussis as the cause of death. Peopleoften decease as a result of the complications (e.g. pneumonia)which will be reported as the cause of death, with the underlyingpertussis disease being missed. The inclusion of pertussis relateddeaths would probably lead to a slightly more favourable cost-effectiveness as adolescent vaccination is estimated to slightlydecrease the incidence in the most vulnerable group (i.e. younginfants). However, if, on the other hand, unreported deaths moreoften occur in adults, the inclusion of this underreporting inmortality could lead to less favourable cost-effectiveness Furthermore, we did not take side effects of the booster vaccine into account. However, the inclusion of side effects will probablynot result in a significant increase in the cost-effectiveness asacellular pertussis vaccines for adolescents are generally charac-terized as safe [29,31]. In clinical trials no significant differences insystematic symptoms between placebo and vaccine groups werenoted [29,31]. Although local reactions can occur, these would notincur any considerable costs or quality of life loss.Pertussis Vaccination PLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 9 October 2010 | Volume 5 | Issue 10 | e13392Finally, we used incidence data from 1996-2000 to obtain age- specific steady state incidences, which are required in order todiscard the time dependence in the incidence and prevalence.Although we are fully aware of the fact that this period did notreflect an endemic equilibrium in reality, we could not neglect theclear increase in incidence numbers from 1996 onwards.Furthermore, data from 2001 onwards was not included as sincethe start of that year pertussis booster vaccination for 4-year olds has been introduced in the Netherlands. Ergo, we believe that our approach is most optimal in the current circumstances. Unfortu-nately we are not able to reliably predict the implications of thisassumption on the cost-effectiveness. To do so, the exact cause ofthe rise in incidence numbers from 1996 has to be known in orderto precisely model this increase. In this analysis we estimated the cost-effectiveness of an acellular pertussis booster vaccine for adolescents. However, in practice the formulation given can also contain diphtheria and tetanus toxoids(dTpa vaccine) [77]. The cost-effectiveness of this combinationvaccine could differ from the cost-effectiveness of a single acellularpertussis booster vaccine. Whether or not this combination vaccinewill be more cost-effective depends on whether the extra costsoutweigh the extra benefits by preventing diphtheria and tetanusas well. To fully and appropriately evaluate the health economicconsequences of this combination vaccine all three diseases shouldbe taken into account in the model. Ideally, a health-economic model is generalisable from one country to the other. Our model can be applied to other countries,however several complicating factors have to be taken intoaccount. In particular, as our model is for an infectious disease,local and national transmission patterns are of importance and themodel should be adapted accordingly to such patterns that willdiffer from the Dutch situation applied in this analysis.Furthermore, national vaccination schedules and exact types of pertussis vaccines used may differ, for example, regarding the number of components included, specific brands and formulations.Obviously, efficacies of different schedules, combinations andbrands may differ. For example, Jefferson et al [27] showed thatthe vaccine effectiveness of vaccines measured in children variedconsiderably from manufacturer to manufacturer. Taking suchdifferences between countries adequately into account would allowour modelling to be extended to other countries. Initiatives for such further work are indeed currently undertaken. Conclusion In conclusion, we designed a dynamic individual-based DES- model to model pertussis transmission in the population in order to estimate the cost-effectiveness of universal booster vaccination strategies. As also holds true for other infectious diseases, to appropriately asses the cost-effectiveness of pertussis vaccination inclusion of herd-immunity effects is crucial as vaccination considerably reduces the transmission in the population. We have shown that adolescent booster vaccination is likely to be a cost- effective intervention for the Dutch situation, as in the Netherlands interventions are certainly considered cost-effective if cost- effectiveness is estimated below a threshold of J20,000 per QALY [78]. However, to make a through-out decision about the implementation of such a pertussis booster vaccination strategy, one should first compare the cost-effectiveness of the adolescent vaccination with that of other vaccination strategies (e.g. adult vaccination or cocooning). This further stresses the reason for developing an individual based model. As a next step a social network can be easily included to appropriately model household contacts in order to accurately estimate the cost-effectiveness of a cocooning strategy. Currently, mixing is only based on age. The main disadvantage of the model is the considerable running time, which made it impossible to run hundreds of simulations. Currently, we are programming the model in another computer language in order to try to speed up the modeling process.
