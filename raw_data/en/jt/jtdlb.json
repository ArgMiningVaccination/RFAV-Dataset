Lee Carlisle, MDb, John Sargent, MDc, Annelle B. Primm, MD, MPHd,e The importance of cultural diversity in the study of childhood trauma has long been appreciated intuitively. Acquiring the empiric evidence to guide assessment and treat- ment, however, has been a slow and arduous process, which is not difficult to under-stand given that culture is a fluid entity relevant to infinite subpopulations. Despite the difficulties, research in the area of childhood trauma has increasingly endeavored to examine and understand issues of culture and diversity. TYPES OF TRAUMA Estimates of lifetime prevalence rates of trauma exposure have been challengingbecause of difficulties with attempts to quantify the nature of trauma, duration, diag- nostic criteria used, cultural factors related to the meaning of the traumatic event, and the available support during and after the trauma. 1There are varying reports of the prevalence rates of childhood trauma in the literature. In 2008, Cohen and colleagues2 reviewed data and reported that up to 68% of youth in a primary care setting had been exposed to potentially life-threatening events (PTE) and greater than half of these indi- viduals have encountered multiple PTEs. A prospective study involving controls andchildhood maltreatment survivors found 98.9% of the 882 participants reported at least 1 traumatic event by the 40 years of age. In this study, the rates of multiple inter- personal traumas were more pronounced in child maltreatment survivors, but the rateof other types of traumatic exposures (ie, natural disasters, combat experience, The authors have nothing to disclose. aMenninger Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, Baylor College of Medicine, 1 Baylor Plaza BCM 350, Houston, TX 77030, USA bDepartment of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, University of Washington, Box 356560, Seattle, WA 98195-6560, USA cDepartment of Psychiatry, Tufts Medical Center, 800 Washington Street, Boston, MA 02111, USA dDepartment of Psychiatry, Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, USA eMinority and National Affairs, American Psychiatric Association, 1000 Boulevard, Suite 1825, Arlington, VA 22209-3901, USA * doi:10.1016/j.chc.2010.07.007 childpsych.theclinics.com 1056-4993/10/$ - see front matter /C2112010 Elsevier Inc.

These results, in keeping with previous studies, pointed to greater revictimization rates among individuals withchildhood trauma histories. LITERATURE REVIEW In this section, the authors summarize key findings of a review of the current literature (Figs. 1 and2) as it pertains to the influence of culture on: (1) incidence of trauma, (2) mental health impact of trauma, (3) resilience, and (4) cultural approaches to care and healing. Incidence and Prevalence A comprehensive literature search of trauma and diverse child populations for theyears 2000 to 2010 is presented in Fig. 1 . The pie chart is a visual representation of the most likely types of sources of trauma found in the backgrounds and historiesof these children and corresponds to the following percentages: sexual abuse 24%,physical abuse 9%, psychological maltreatment 0%, neglect 21%, terrorism 9%, natural disasters 1%, refugee trauma or war zone trauma 1%, domestic violence 11%, complex trauma 0%, traumatic grief 0%, community violence 1%, schoolviolence 2%, medical trauma or medical child abuse 0%, and other trauma 43%. Another search using identical parameters and databases as in Fig. 1 , but expand- ing them to include the years 1990 to 2010 is represented in Fig. 2 . The bar graph demonstrates a dramatic increase in the volume of research relating to trauma anddiverse childhood populations from 1990 to the present. The development of trauma-related maladaptive symptoms has been shown to vary dependent upon trauma type and cumulative rates of exposure because of culturaland ethnic variables. In 2009, Kar delineated youths' risk for subsequent posttrau- matic stress disorder (PTSD) associated with trauma type noting natural disasters sexual abuse school neglect community violenceotherdomestic violencephysical abuserefugee/warterrorismnatural disastersTrauma and Diverse Child Populations 2000 to 2010 by Category Fig. 1.

( Courtesy of Lee Carlisle, MD, Seattle, WA.)Harris et al 870(earthquakes, hurricanes, floods, tsunami, cyclone, and so forth) in the range of 5% to 43% or greater, and man-made disaster survivors (community violence, war, terrorism, and so forth) with higher rates of PTSD (30% to 100%).1In 2009, Courtois and Ford outlined Terr's (1991) differentiation of trauma types and prevalence rates.3,4 Trauma types were delineated based upon frequency, type I traumas were describedas the result of single, unexpected occurrences; whereas, type II (complex traumas) were described as repetitive or chronic in nature. The prevalence rates varied betweentypes. According to research, type II trauma is more prevalent and is associated witha greater risk for developing PTSD versus type I trauma (33%-75% vs 10%-20%). 3 Research concerning effects of cultural diversity on child sexual abuse (CSA) accounted for the greatest number of studies and more empiric data than any ofthe other childhood traumas. It also generated the greatest amount of questions, confusion, and conflicting evidence. For example, studies of cross-cultural differences in CSA have generated widely varying results. In 1984, Kercher and McShane 5found that more Latino women reported child sexual abuse than African Americans or non- Latino whites. In 1986, Lindholm and Wiley6found African American children reported higher rates than Latino or non-Latino whites, who both had similar rates. In yet another study from 1994, Urquiza and Goodin-Jones7found lower levels of CSA among Latino college students. Similar inconsistencies have been present in studies addressing willingness to disclose, severity of abuse, and emotional response to CSA. Comparisons acrossstudies were difficult because of varying research methods, nonuniform definitions of CSA, and the presence of study subjects from multiple cultures within broad ethnic groups researched. Among Asian Americans, Zhai and Gao 8found lower rates and lower recurrence of child maltreatment as compared with other cultural populations. In regard to the typeof abuse, Asian Americans had lower rates of neglect and sexual abuse and higherrates of physical abuse when compared with other cultural groups. The investigators proposed that beliefs in physical punishment and the value of parental authority were risk factors for physical abuse in diverse child populations. ( Courtesy of Lee Carlisle, MD, Seattle, WA.)Trauma and Diverse Child Populations 871In a unique study, Freisthler, Bruce, and Needell9applied spatial regression proce- dures to 940 census tracts in California to explore the impact of neighborhood processes on child maltreatment. For African American children, they found higher rates of maltreatment were associated with higher rates of poverty. In addition to this expected finding, however, they also found a higher density of off-premise alcoholoutlets correlated with higher rates of maltreatment. Decreased rates of child maltreat- ment for African American youths were associated with an increase in population since the 1990 census, neighborhoods consisting of a higher percentage of AfricanAmericans, and neighborhoods with an influx of more new residents. Similarly, percentages of Hispanic youth in neighborhoods also correlated with decreases in reports of child maltreatment. The investigators hypothesized that neighborhoodswere less likely to report child maltreatment as they became more segregated orthat these neighborhoods became less suspicious of parenting choices of their neigh- bors as caseworkers and residents became more familiar with the parenting styles. Child-care burden, defined by the number of adults (>20 years of age), children(<13 years of age), and the percentage of elderly residents, was also assessed. Higher rates of child maltreatment were correlated with increased child-care burden only in non-Hispanic white children, contrary to the hypothesis that neighborhood disorgani-zation results in higher maltreatment reports. What may be representative of disorga- nization in one culture may be strength in another culture. Mental Health Impact of Trauma Roberts and colleagues10looked at race/ethnic differences related to PTSD trauma type and help seeking. African Americans and Hispanics had higher risk of child maltreatment; whereas, Asian Americans, African American men, and Hispanicwomen had higher risk of war-related events than non-Hispanic whites. Among those exposed to trauma, PTSD risk was slightly higher among African Americans and lower among Asian Americans compared with non-Hispanic whites. A prospective study of 574 children aged 5 to 21 years, by Lansford and colleagues, 11explored early physical abuse and its association with adolescent sequelae in work, romantic relationships, parenthood mental health, and violent delin-quency. With a particular focus on race and gender, they found significantly greatereffects of early physical abuse on later violence in African American youth as compared with non-Hispanic whites and girls versus boys. Researchers speculated poorer outcomes for African Americans were caused by minority status associatedwith increased rates of residential instability, residing in violent neighborhoods, expe- riences with racism, fewer opportunities for mental health care, or inadequate mental health care. Studies have documented the risk for revictimization is greatest among CSA survi- vors. Other investigators delineated adverse childhood experiences, such asemotional withdrawal by a caretaker, physical neglect by a caretaker, a caretaker'sfailure to provide protection, sexual abuse by a non-caretaker, and any type of sexualabuse, were found to be predictive of future victimization. 12,13 Traumatic experiences have been documented to occur within the context of immigration. Literature findings delineating the adverse mental health sequelaethat were outside of the scope of this literature review have been summarized by these authors. Trauma exposure for immigrant children, in addition to encom- passing the same, full spectrum of risk as other youth, is aggravated by theunique process of immigration, a process that, by itself, is inherently traumatic. Immigration trauma can be broken down into 3 phases: preimmigration, migra- tion/journey, and resettlement.Harris et al 872Preimmigration trauma occurs in the child's homeland and often includes exposure to violence and persecution. Bolea and colleagues14explored the experiences of Sudanese immigrants in the Midwest for whom murders of parents and siblings were common in this phase. Children have also witnessed torture and rape of family and community members; whereas, others have been coerced into committing theseacts as child soldiers. The investigators propose that the grieving process associated with these traumas is often overlooked because, despite the fact the traumas occurred there, these children still experience the loss of their homeland. Findingthe support from family or immigrating community may be difficult because parents and other adults are suffering from the same traumas. 15 Migration traumas include dangerous, often long, journeys, separation from parents or other family members, and those associated with detention facilities and refugee camps. In their flight to safety, Sudanese immigrants experienced starvation, attacks by lions, and near drowning in rivers inhabited by crocodiles. The camps were also dangerous, with scarcity of water, food, and medicine. The foster parents of one childsubstantiated the reports of the lack of safety in the camps as exemplified by their foster child hiding his clothes and shoes each night because they had been stolen as he slept in camps. 14Children who are separated from family members experience higher rates of trauma and associated depression, anxiety, and PTSD symptoms as compared with accompanied minors.16Growing up with the uncertainty associated with these camps and facilities causes many children to lose hope of ever getting a new home.15 Resettlement traumas are about adapting to a new culture. Immigrant children, in addition to dealing with racism and stigmatization in both the neighborhood and school, have been described as cultural brokers because of their tendency to acquirelanguage faster, which often leads to intergenerational tensions at home. 16 Ngo and Le17investigated serious violence in immigrant youth of Chinese and Southeast Asian origins. The Cambodian and Laotian youth were exposed to the high-est levels of stressors. Physical abuse in all groups except Chinese youth wasa predictor of violence. The individual's level of perceived support buffered against most stressors. This finding was in contradistinction to acculturation, intergenerational conflict, and individualism, which predicted more violence. Additional data obtained outside of the literature review in Fig. 1 revealed factors associated with the negative impact of natural disasters on childhood mental health.In 2006, Thienkrua and colleagues 18reported on data collected at 2 and 9 months after the tsunami. These researchers utilized a modified version of the PsySTARTRapid Triage System, the University of California at Los Angeles PTSD Reaction Index, and the Birleson Depression Self-Rating Scale and noted that the presence of PTSD and depression was highest among children who were displaced and resided incamps. A total of 75% of the children in displacement camps had direct contact with tsunami exposure. PTSD symptoms were seen in 13% of children in the camps in comparison to those from unaffected villages (6%). PTSD symptoms persisted inthe children residing in camps at 9 months (10%). The prevalence of depressive symp- toms remained the same in children residing in camps: 11% at 2 months and 12% at 9 months. Risk factors for PTSD symptoms included delayed evacuation times,displacement, increased exposure to disaster, perceived life danger of either self or loved ones, experiencing fear or anxiety during traumatic exposure, and sustaining a physical injury. Risk factors for depressive symptoms included perception of lifeor family endangerment and older age. When youth have been exposed to natural disasters, war, and family violence, the risk for subsequent psychiatric sequelae are increased. In 2008, Catani andcolleagues 19examined this relationship with childhood tsunami survivors and foundTrauma and Diverse Child Populations 873higher rates of PTSD (30.4%) and major depression (19.6%) and previous and current periods of suicidality (22.6% and 17.2% respectively) in children with prior war expo-sure, family violence, and father's history of alcohol intake. In a prior review of Hurricane Katrina's impact on childhood mental health, Drury and colleagues 20cited disrupted mental health services, and inadequate, poorly coor- dinated governmental responses as infrastructure deficits that contributed to initial challenges with supporting the mental health of Katrina survivors. These investigators reported data from the Kaiser Foundation (2007) that noted worsening of mental healthstatus of adults (15%) and their children (4%) and lack of access to mental health services for children in the 6 months before this study (9%). 21One study reviewed in this manuscript identified PTSD symptoms in a multiethnic school-age population to be 50% (62.5% who remained in New Orleans vs 43.5% who evacuated beforethe hurricane). 22Of the children who screened positive for PTSD, 88.% were found to have a comorbid psychiatric disorder with separation anxiety disorder and opposi-tional defiant disorders most common. Two favorable intervention studies were cited;group formats utilizing relaxation and exposure therapy, and cognitive behavioral therapy and narrative therapy in either group or individual formats were all found to reduce anxiety symptoms in hurricane survivors. Recent cross-sectional data from Peters and colleagues 23identified the risk of increased alcohol and drug use among 170 African American and Hispanic-Americanmales after Hurricane Ike. These researchers identified statistically significant use ofsubstances was increased in boys (aged 9-19 years) who attempted to suppress thoughts related to the hurricane: alcohol Similar to other studies that identified increase substance use in adults following disasters, Peters and colleagues found increased rates of substance use in a child and adolescent population. Resilience: Protective and Risk Factors Given high rates of lifetime trauma exposure, attention to protective and risk factors will aide in the understanding of which youth are most likely to suffer adverse and long-standing sequelae of trauma. Both biologic and psychosocial factors have been asso-ciated with psychological resilience. More recent attention has been focused on exploration of the role of environment and genetic influences on the stress response during development. Heritability has been shown to contribute to 30% to 40% ofthe risk to develop mood and anxiety disorders including PTSD. 24 Gillespie and colleagues24summarized data reported on this topic. Stressful life events experienced during development have been shown to alter the hypotha-lamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, which can result in subsequent anxiety or mood disorders. Predisposing genetic variables lend either toward the development of vulnerabilities or resilience in youth exposed to traumatic events. Scientists have iden-tified FKBP5 and CRHRI as 2 genes involved in the regulation of the HPA axis followingexposure to traumatic events. Additional data reviewed by Gillepsie and colleagues suggested that a critical period exists during which brain exposure to corticosterone affects fear learning that is modulated by the quality of maternal care. Therefore, whentrauma is experienced within a supportive environment, an amygdala-dependent emotional circuit is developed that can distinguish between nonthreatening and threatening environmental cues. Resilience has emerged as an independent research issue involving a plethora of interesting social and cultural considerations. DuMont and colleagues 25prospectively followed a cohort of CSA, physical abuse, and neglect cases matched withHarris et al 874nonabused children of similar age and ethnicity over 22 years. Eight domains of resil- ience were measured: education, psychiatric disorder, substance abuse, officialreports of arrest, self-reports of violent behavior, employment, homelessness, and social activity. Overall, 48% of abused children compared with 61% of controls were resilient in adolescence, and in young adulthood, 30.2% compared with 46%,respectively. Nonwhites were statistically more likely to be resilient in adolescence. Individuals who were shown to be consistently resilient throughout adolescence and young adulthood had the following characteristics: female and either lived withboth parents, had a long first placement, or had a highly supportive relationship. Non- resilience was associated with being male, white, and either having a brief first place- ment, less likely to live with both parents, or less likely to have a supportiverelationship. This study contributed to the field's understanding of resilience identi-fying that female, African Americans who were maltreated in childhood appeared to be more resilient in this sample. Children exposed to trauma demonstrate higher rates of delinquency. Several studies have now demonstrated that a strong ethnic identity can be a mitigatingfactor in delinquency following childhood trauma. Bruce and Waelde 26studied 307 adolescents in the California Bay Area and found higher levels of ethnic iden- tity correlated with less delinquency in the presence of increasing trauma symp- toms. This protective effect of ethnic identity is much stronger for minorities than for non-Hispanic whites. Zhai and Gao8found lower rates of neglect and CSA among Asian Americans. Protective factors were thought to arise from the focus on family harmony, reputation,and high degree of indulgence of preschool children. However, when CSA did occur ina study involving South Asian immigrant women, Singh and colleagues 27used semi- structured interviews and found the following protective factors: sense of hope, South Asian social support system, social advocacy, and intentional self-care. Castro and colleagues28identified resilience in Latino adolescents whose fathers were illicit drug users. Family traditionalism, specifically the conservative culturalvalues of respect for elders and family traditions, and sense of social responsibility toward the cultural community were all found to be protective. Austin 29studied connections between use of alcohol, tobacco, and other drug use and violence among rural native Hawaiians and suggested ethnic pride to be protective against violent behavior. Siqueira and Crandall30looked at differences in risk and protective factors for binge drinking among adolescents from 6 Hispanic subgroups in Florida. Theirconclusion was that prevention programs focused on Hispanic subgroups ethnically rather than addressing all Hispanics as one culture. Moscardino and colleagues 31used semistructured interviews with caregivers of child survivors of the terrorist school siege in Beslan, Russia in 2004 and suggestedreturn to normality, reinforcement of the positive, good social supports, and culturally shared values toward the common threat of possible future terrorist attacks as protec-tive factors. Spilsbury and colleagues 32found, as have others, nonwhite ethnicity to be a protective factor for behavioral problems in children exposed to domestic violence. The escalating HIV/AIDS epidemic in Tanzania and Kenya raised concern by Lalor33 of increased CSA related to a practice in which infected individuals use sex with a child to cleanse themselves. Plummer and Njuguna34collected data from 36 professionals from a variety of tribal groups across Kenya and found their concerns to be similar. Protective factors were based on traditions and religion, criminal punishment, rigidgender roles, and the high value placed on a female child's virginity. Risk factors, which included strict patriarchy, inflexible gender roles, and low emphasis on chil- dren's rights, were likewise deeply rooted in culture, the same culture in which theTrauma and Diverse Child Populations 875protective factors were present. The consensus of this study was that sexual abuse is clearly intertwined with culture and therefore any prevention and treatment approachwould, by necessity, need to be culturally relevant. Psychological resilience after trauma has been documented in diverse child and adolescent populations. Individual, family, community, and cultural variables havebeen identified that can support posttraumatic growth and development in children exposed to trauma. Further study is warranted to develop clinical application. Cultural Approaches to Care and Healing When experiencing psychological distress, racial and ethnic minorities are less likely to follow up with traditional mental health providers while experiencing psychological distress and more likely to seek help through family, faith leaders, or through folk medi- cine.35All minority groups (African Americans, Asian Americans, Hispanic Americans) were less likely to seek treatment for PTSD than non-Hispanic whites and fewer than half of minorities with PTSD sought treatment in the study conducted by Roberts and colleagues.10These authors reviewed the following factors contributing to decreased help seeking: (1) stigma related to mental health disorders and treatment, (2) lack of desire to pursue and receive psychological support outside of the family unless under extreme conditions, (3) perceived ethnic or racial bias in mental health or health careproviders, and (4) decreased access to health and mental health care in lower socio- economic communities. The findings from Roberts and colleagues indicated that PTSD and other psychiatric sequelae of childhood trauma among US race and ethnicminorities have been largely undiagnosed and untreated, indicating a need for invest-ment in accessible, culturally sensitive treatment options. CLINICAL ASSESSMENT/DIAGNOSTIC CHALLENGES A myriad of adverse health and mental health sequelae of childhood trauma havepreviously been described in the literature. When conducting a mental health evalua-tion of a youth following a traumatic event, there are many broad areas or domains to be assessed. In addition to information gathered through clinical interviews and collat- eral reports, psychometric instruments have been useful to assist with the assessmentprocess of children and adolescents who have experienced trauma; low agreements between caregiver and youth reports of internalized symptoms warrant multiple infor- mants and psychometrics. Box 1 contains a review of psychometric tools used in diverse youth populations. 36-38 The authors of this article used Kendall-Tackett's outline of 4 potential pathways following childhood maltreatment as a framework for child trauma assessment.12In addition to the 4 areas identified by Kendall-Tackett (behavioral, social, cognitive Box 1 Trauma and diverse child populations Semistructured and self-report measures have been summarized in the literature by Spates and colleagues,36Lemos-Miller and Kearney,37and Hawkins and Radcliffe38: 1. Semi-structured: Child and Adolescent Psychiatric Assessment: Life Events Section and PTSD Module, Children's PTSD inventory 2. Self-report: Children's PTSD Inventory, Trauma Symptom Checklist for Children, Child PTSD Symptom Scale, Screen for Child Anxiety Related Emotional Disorders, Children's Depression Inventory, Posttraumatic Cognitions Inventory, Adolescent Dissociative Experiences ScaleHarris et al 876and emotional), the authors included a fifth pathway to address cultural factors to be considered in the clinical evaluation of a youth. Behavioral Among all of the pathways, the behavioral outcomes of trauma are the best described, including harmful activities, such as the misuse and abuse of substances (tobacco, alcohol, and illicit substances); disordered eating; self-injurious behavior; suicideattempts and ideation; high-risk sexual behavior; and poor sleep hygiene. These harmful behaviors often result in subsequent medical and psychiatric sequelae. During initial and subsequent evaluations, traumatized youth warrant screening for individual(suicidality; self-injurious behavior; substance intoxication/withdrawal; high-risk sexual practices; and aggression toward others, property, and so forth), family (domestic violence, physical, sexual, or psychological abuse by current caretakers),and community (community violence) safety concerns. Vital signs; urine toxicology screens; and laboratory data to assess the nutritional and metabolic status, the pres- ence or absence of sexually transmitted diseases, and general health of the youthhave been recommended based upon clinical history. In addition to the monitoringof safety concerns, the encouragement of consistent feeding and sleeping schedules and the return to normal routines have been shown to improve clinical outcomes of trauma survivors. Social Social pathways of childhood trauma survivors lead to adverse outcomes in adult- hood. These adverse outcomes are related to interpersonal styles, victimization rates, and rates of homelessness. Kendall-Tackett reviewed the data of Becker-Lausen andMallon-Kraft (1997) that described the maladaptive interpersonal styles of childhood maltreatment survivors. 39Becker-Lausen and Mallon-Kraft characterized individuals as either manifesting avoidant or intrusive patterns of interacting with others based upon varying degrees of interdependency, self-disclosure, and warmth. When comparing the interaction styles, individuals who demonstrated an avoidant style were described as having low self-disclosure, low interdependency, and low warmth,and individuals who demonstrated intrusive styles were described as having highinterdependency, high self-disclosure, and an excessive need for closeness. Both of these patterns of interpersonal styles led to impaired social interactions and limited social support. Prior studies have highlighted the association between adequatesocial support and good health behaviors, particularly in individuals of lower socioeco- nomic status. Obtaining historical information from the youth and collateral reports will assist in identifying potential maladaptive interpersonal styles to be addressed duringtreatment planning. As previously discussed, there is a high risk of revictimization among CSA survivors. With revictimization, the trauma survivor has an increased risk of acquiring a sexuallytransmitted disease and for chronic stress negatively impacting health and psycholog-ical wellbeing. Given the risk of revictimization, ongoing surveillance for safety concerns is indicated in conjunction with treatment plans, including a formal mecha- nism to improve safety awareness. Homelessness has been identified as another potential social consequence of child- hood trauma. Sexual and physical abuse in studies involving women have shown thatabused women with similar socioeconomic status were more likely to be homeless incomparison to their counterparts who were domiciled. The association between family violence, separations caused by foster care placements, and homelessness place chil- dren with histories of family violence at risk for subsequent traumas and fragmentedTrauma and Diverse Child Populations 877social networks. In addition, a disproportionate number of minority children from underrepresented backgrounds have been placed in the foster care system, whichcarries added risk for potential homelessness. 40Homelessness has caused and exac- erbated harmful health effects related to malnutrition, lack of medical care, inclementweather exposure, increased risk of physical injury, and lack of routine hygiene. Cognitive Beliefs and attitudes have been shown to impact health. The internal working model has been studied as a framework individuals have used to interpret the motives or actions of others and stressful or negative life events. Childhood trauma survivorshave been described to distort reality in multiple domains, negatively interpreting life events, underestimating their own capacity to deal with real and perceived danger, and overestimating adversity and danger. Cognitive distortions such as these haveincreased psychological distress in trauma survivors and increased the likelihood of depression. Interpersonal trust and optimism have both been linked to longevity; however, childhood trauma survivors have less potential for both of these cognitivepatterns based on prior adversities. Other investigators have also described the rela-tionship between traumatized youth's cognitions and psychological symptoms. Cognitions related to traumatic experiences have been shown to be key factors for the onset of PTSD and emotional dysregulation. Obsessive thoughts; negative self-appraisals; and avoidant coping strategies, such as thought suppression, have been found in maltreated youth. 37Within the context of a mental health assessment, eliciting information regarding the youth's cognitions and related emotions associated with traumatic events has been an essential component of case formulation and the identification of appropriate treatment recommendations. Along with having a propensity to develop cognitive distortions, the literature has described a frequent misperception of perceived danger in childhood trauma survi- vors. These misperceptions have resulted in increased levels of cortisol or stress hormone levels leading to immune system suppression, neurotoxicity, increased rates of chronic diseases, and slower wound healing. Mulvihill further reviewed adversehealth outcomes of childhood trauma and noted the increased rates of chronic diseases, including ischemic heart disease, liver disease, cancer, chronic lung disease, and skeletal fractures. 41As previously discussed, the mental health evalua- tion and treatment of childhood survivors has health implications that call for collabo- ration with primary care physicians to assure optimum physical health over the lifespan of this patient population. Emotional Over the past 3 decades, researchers have identified the significance of negative emotions related to childhood trauma. Researchers have described unique challenges that clinicians may face who attempt to conduct culturally sensitive evaluations duringor after a traumatic event for youth and families. 1In conjunction with being attuned to the cultural nuances of clinical presentations, health and mental health care providers who work with the pediatric population are also called to take into consideration the developmental phase and cognitive capacity of the individual. The limited verbal abil-ities and level of cognitive development have been identified as barriers clinicians encounter during the assessment and treatment process. Recognizing the impact of development on clinical symptoms, the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) has added specific descriptors for children and adolescents to aide in the diagnosis of psychiatric disorders. Symptoms following traumatic exposuremay overlap with the symptoms of several diagnostic categories, including anxiety,Harris et al 878mood, disruptive, and substance abuse disorders. Following exposure to traumatic events, if symptomatic, the majority of youth will experience either anxiety, or moodsymptoms following a traumatic event. 38This next section will focus specifically on pediatric and adolescent posttraumatic stress disorder and associated impairmentsand conditions following traumatic exposures. Since the introduction of PTSDs, many investigators have proposed alternate criteria to delineate the full range of symptoms extending beyond PTSDs classic triadof intrusion, avoidance, and hyperarousal seen in youth with complex trauma histories.In 2009, Courtois and Ford reviewed the scientific literature's call for attention to post- traumatic adaptation and a broader examination of the complete range of symptoms following childhood complex trauma. 3They cited the work of van der Kolk42and the National Child Traumatic Stress Network, which has supported the incorporation ofDevelopmental Trauma Disorder (DTD) in the upcoming addition of DSM V (Fifth Edition). Similar to disorders of extreme stress not otherwise specified described by Herman and van der Kolk in adults, 3,43DTD would include developmentally adverse interper- sonal trauma as an objective Cluster A1 criteria. DTD would also provide criteria to denote 3 additional features outside of classic PTSD that highlight behavioral and rela-tional challenges more pronounced in traumatized youth: (1) dysregulation triggered by trauma related stressors negatively impacting emotions, cognitions, physical/somatic, behavior, self attributions, and behavior; (2) beliefs altered by recurrent betrayals andoccurrences of abandonment that have negatively impacted personality structure development, creating a lack of trust in others and future expectations of revictimization and self-blame; and (3) impairments in major domains of functioning (interpersonal rela-tionships [family or peer], school, employment, and legal issues). The range of dysfunc-tion caused by complex trauma spans all 5 axes, including (1) Axis I: frequent comorbidity with mood disorders, somatoform disorders, eating disorders, substance abuse disorders, and other anxiety disorders; (2) Axis II: personality disorders; (3) AxisIII: acute and chronic health conditions described previously; (4) social, educational, vocational, and legal challenges; and (5) overall impaired functioning. Cultural As previously described, exposure to traumatic events in childhood has occurred glob-ally in varying degrees among all ethnic groups. Culture has been shown to influence and modify behavioral and emotional responses to trauma, the cognitive beliefsregarding the trauma itself, and impact of the societal roles of the family, and the com- munity's individual and collective response to trauma. Since the establishment of cultural psychiatry in 1969, this field has highlighted the importance of factoring incultural influences when evaluating behaviors, help-seeking patterns, and response to psychiatric treatment. Cultural perspectives are needed to differentiate between normative and maladaptive behaviors. Models for conducting culturally sensitiveassessments for children, adolescents, and families have been described. 44Hays's model, which incorporates various aspects of an individual's identity and group affilia- tions, has been described in the literature.45,46Brown describes Hays's acronym ADDRESSING to delineate the following social A: age-related factors (chro- nologic age and cohort); (acquired and developmental ability, visible, and invisible); R: religion and spirituality; E: ethnic origins, culture, race/phenotype; social class, (history of status, personal or family; refugee); G: gender and biologic sex (male, female, intersex); and gender identity (masculine, feminine, or transgender).Trauma and Diverse Child Populations 879The challenges associated with the evaluation of children and adolescents within an appropriate sociocultural context have been well documented. Lack of knowledge about a particular culture and personal clinician bias negatively impact clinical encounters.44Likewise, an individual or family's negative bias against mental health care and the mental health provider's cultural background also threaten or interfere with the successful establishment of a therapeutic alliance. Within the DSM, there are 2 sections of content that have been helpful to identify cultural considerations for mental health clinicians. The DSM-IV-TR (Text Revision)outline for cultural formulation (2000) has been used as a tool to improve the skill of the clinician to address these cultural concerns in a systematic manner; this issue of the DSM also included a glossary of culture-bound syndromes. 47In 2001 Gaw reviewed idioms of distress related to acute stressdisorder, such as falling out in African American and Caribbean cultural groups, and proposed utilizing DSM IV diagnostic categories for clinical application. 48For addi- tional information regarding conducting culturally relevant child and adolescent mental health assessments, refer to article by Pumariega and colleagues elsewhere in this issue. Treatment Because of the multiple domains that childhood trauma affects, a multidisciplinary team that addresses the biologic, psychological, and sociocultural sequelae has been proven most effective. Using the behavioral-social-cultural-cognitive-emotional framework proposed in the assessment section, the authors recommend a similarapproach for treatment. Safety concerns of the youth or family identified in the evalu- ation are addressed throughout the assessment and treatment phases. Using this clin- ical vignette, the authors explore a step-wise assessment and treatment process ofa traumatized youth based upon clinical guidelines and research evidence. CASE PRESENTATION Preflight Astrid is a fictitious name used to protect the identity of a 12-year-old Haitian girl. Before January 12, 2010 she lived in Port-au-Prince, Haiti in a small concrete housewith her mother and 2 younger sisters. Before her father left the household, he would frequently physically abuse Astrid's mother. His departure led to a worsened financial state for her family. Flight When the earthquake occurred that afternoon, Astrid was playing outside with her 8-year-old sister. As the quake shook her house, Astrid and her sister were terrified. While they watched, their house collapsed, killing Astrid's mother and her 5-year-old sister. Astrid was terrified during the earthquake and then horrified as she ran to the house, lying in rubble. She looked for her mother and sister and did not find them. An adult neighbor found Astrid and her sister and got food for them amid thechaos. Astrid and her sister had not been physically injured but were frightened and crying. Over the next 2 weeks, Astrid stayed with her neighbor's family and obtained food periodically. They slept outdoors. Astrid was withdrawn and generally noncom-municative. In an effort to cope with the recent tragedy, Astrid and her sister drankteas to heal the soul from mourning daily and attended prayer vigils with their neigh- bors held across the city; however, no formal mental support was accessed.Harris et al 880Resettlement Astrid's maternal aunt, Ruby, lives in the Haitian community in Boston. She had immi- grated to Boston 15 years previously to attend college and remained as a teacher ina public high school. Ruby is married to a fellow Haitian and has 2 children (5 years old and 2 years old). She learned of her sister's death in the earthquake, which left Astrid and her sister orphaned. In the 2 weeks immediately following the earthquake,Ruby made arrangements to bring Astrid and her sister to Boston. They were able to come to Boston to stay with her aunt in early February. Astrid spoke Creole, which her aunt's family also spoke. She shared a room in the family's apartment with her sisterand was registered to attend the neighborhood middle school in Boston. Shortly after arriving in Boston, Astrid began waking up each night crying with night- mares. She also began complaining of chest pain, abdominal pain, and dizziness fol-lowed by syncopal-like episodes at school, regularly visiting the school nurse. She also began complaining before school. Her aunt became alarmed and took Astrid to visit the local health center. Astrid would not speak with her doctor but her physicalexamination, chest radiograph, and cardiogram were all normal. The physician askedhow Astrid was doing emotionally and Ruby assured the doctor that she was \"OK.\" Astrid's teacher, Mrs Lewis, contacted Ruby about Astrid's behavior and perfor- mance in school and recommended that she take Astrid for a mental health evaluation.Ruby became very defensive and did not want to discuss Astrid's difficulties with her teacher. Ruby felt that Astrid was behaving appropriately at home, and knew that she was having significant difficulty concentrating in school and was not attemptingschoolwork. She was aware that Astrid's emotions fluctuated between crying; with- drawal; and complaining of pain, dizziness, and periods of blacking out. Ruby felt more comfortable sharing Astrid's struggles with her parish's priest, who recommen-ded prayer sessions with church leaders to heal Astrid's soul. After a month of taking Astrid to meet with the priest and participate in prayer sessions, a fellow congregant mentioned that her cousin had received help from theBoston Haitian Mental Health Network for similar problems following the earthquake.Ruby was encouraged to take Astrid to a local neighborhood mental health center that had an affiliation with the Haitian Mental Health Network. Ruby relayed to the coun- selor the difficulties that Astrid had been having at school. Ruby stated that Astriddid play with her sister and would interact with her younger cousins but that at times she would isolate in her room. The counselor contacted a member of the Haitian Mental Health Alliance who met with Astrid and her aunt. This therapist spoke with Astrid in Creole and helped Astridexplain her pain and discomfort. The Haitian American clinician also helped Astrid begin to talk about what happened during the earthquake. Astrid spoke of her terrorwhen the ground shook and of her guilt about her mother's death and her sadnessat missing her mother. She fluctuated between being in pain, being tearful, and acting stoic and dazed. The Haitian American therapist agreed to continue to meet with Astrid. Astrid did seem relieved after talking with the Haitian Americancounselor. Five months after the earthquake Astrid was continuing to have nightmares, but was attending school. Astrid was able to play with her sister and was learning English. Shewas continuing in weekly therapy with the Haitian American therapist. Astrid's problem list included displacement from her homeland and subsequent language barrier and cultural dissonance between Astrid and her school environment,death of caregiver, and prior and acute trauma exposure from domestic violenceand the recent disaster. Using the framework discussed previously, based uponTrauma and Diverse Child Populations 881Kendall-Tackett's and Hay's models, the authors identified the following factors in her assessment. In the behavioral pathway, Astrid had not demonstrated any safety concerns or harmful behaviors based upon clinical examination and collateral reports from her aunt and teachers; however, she did receive continued screening for such behaviors throughout treatment. Historical details from Astrid's case highlighted deficits in her social functioning. Following the earthquake, Astrid and her sister experienced an abrupt change in theirhome life with the traumatic loss of their mother, homelessness, and the temporarylack of basic needs. Case management is beneficial in such instances in assisting with the immediate and ongoing needs of children and families impacted by trauma. Case managers can help families navigate the complexities of interfacing with govern-mental, social, educational, and mental health agencies and organizations. During the initial phases of her resettlement with her maternal relatives in the United States, Astrid did manifest a maladaptive interpersonal style seen commonly in child-hood survivors as indicated by her avoidant interaction patterns with peers and family.Psychoeducation provided to Astrid, her family, and school personnel assisted with a greater understanding of her trauma sequelae and supported the need for treatment. School-based group cognitive behavioral therapy programs promoting adaptiveinterpersonal skills have proven effective for trauma survivors (cognitive behavioral interventions for trauma in schools) and could prove beneficial to Astrid. 2Group inter- personal psychotherapy to target mood, anxiety, and conduct symptoms in refugee children with war-related traumas successfully reduced depressive symptoms in female, but not male, children who participated in Verdeli's 2008 study.49In 2008, Rousseau and Guzder reviewed alternate school-based prevention programs aimed at supporting successful postmigration and found them to have longitudinal outcomesthat encourage their use to promote protective factors in refugee youth. 50Astrid and her sister could benefit from participation in school-based intervention to addressexisting difficulties and prevent subsequent psychiatric sequelae related to trauma,loss, and migration. With the aid of the DSM cultural-bound syndromes, a consideration for falling out will be made based upon Astrid's symptoms of dizziness that proceed collapse, whichmay correspond to either a conversion disorder or dissociative disorder. Falling out, or blacking out, as a culture-bound syndrome has been described in the DSM as a cultur- ally recognized idiom of distress in Caribbean populations and seen in the southernUnited States. 47 Relocation with her maternal relatives provided Astrid and her sister with a family unit that has previous history with cultural differences between their native countryand host country. Her aunt could potentially identify with Astrid's acculturation issues.Ruby initially sought help in her community of faith, but pursued the congregant's suggestion of a formal mental health assessment. In other refugee families, this might not be the case where the practice of voodoo, sometimes seen in this cultural group,and the use of indigenous healers would be the preferred sources of psychological support. Astrid's initial tendency to use avoidant coping strategies enhanced her likelihood to develop psychiatric sequelae following trauma. Along with these maladaptive strate-gies, Astrid's cognitive distortions were recognized during the clinical interview previ- ously discussed. Within the context of individual psychotherapy, data supports that these cognitive distortions could be addressed using cognitive and behavioral therapyor trauma-focused cognitive behavioral therapy. In reviewing the emotional and cultural pathways of Astrid's case, her diagnoses consisted of acute stress reaction with the potential for posttraumatic stress disorderHarris et al 882and possibly the culture-bound syndrome of falling out. During the initial aftermath of traumatic events after the disaster, emotional first aid strategies and their benefitstoward fostering social support and emotional regulation following traumatic events have been well delineated in the literature. 1A myriad of psychotherapy and pharma- cotherapy options could be used in treatment of her symptoms of acute stress. Along with cognitive behavioral therapy modalities, additional recommendations for evidence-based psychotherapy include the use of brief psychoanalytic psycho- therapy to explore the traumatic events. This practice has been shown to assist thechildhood survivor with anxiety reduction, prevent progression of depression, and process grief. 1 For refugee children traumatized by war-related violence, narrative exposure therapy (KidNet) demonstrated reduction in PTSD symptoms in this patient popula- tion, which was sustained for up to 1 year.51This treatment option may have a role in all forms of trauma to assist with the habituation of the trauma response while con-structing a narrative of the youth's life events, including past traumas. For Astrid'syounger 5-year-old sibling, play therapy and parent-child psychotherapy would be appropriate interventions given her developmental level and cognitive abilities. Astrid's psychiatric symptoms (anxiety, mood, somatic, and sleep) have improved with mental health services and community support. Therefore, a pharmacologic inter-vention was not indicated at this point. The role of pharmacotherapy in the context of treating traumatized youth has limited evidence; however, use of psychotropic agentsto treat comorbid psychosis, agitation, mood dysregulation, anxiety, and impaired sleep has been recommended clinically. In 2010, Harris and Sargent outlined the current recommendations for adult and pediatric populations, which include (1) anti-depressants (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, selective anticonvulsants, and (5) benzodiazepines. 52 When prescribing for diverse patient populations, observation for the potential impact of cultural and ethnic differences on medication response and or adverseeffects is warranted. For more than 30 years, varying responses to psychotropic medi- cations have been described in the literature. 53In addition to ethnic specific mutations that can impact the metabolism of drugs, there are nonbiologic factors, including diet (herbs, caffeine, and so forth), smoking, gender, and age, that justify consideration.54 For a more comprehensive discussion of specific ethnic differences in metabolism of psychotropic agents, please refer to Ruiz and colleagues (2000),55Ng and colleagues (2008),56and article by Lawson and colleagues elsewhere in this issue. FUTURE DIRECTIONS/SUMMARY Although some responses to trauma are universal, culture counts in the impact oftrauma in children and youth from ethnically and racially diverse groups. Risk and inci-dence of trauma, manifestations of idioms of distress, psychopathology, and malad-aptive responses to traumatic experiences are all culturally modified. Culture plays an important role in what, if any, help is sought for posttraumatic mental health need, whether it be from a mental health professional or someone in the sociocultural realmof the child. This help may be from a family member, a religious leader, or a traditional healer. Culture is an important factor in determining resilience. Both perceived social support and strong ethnic identity have been found to foster resilience in children andyouth from US ethnic and racial minority groups. The statement that risk factors are not predictive factors because of protective factors is highly applicable to diverse children and youth exposed to trauma. GivenTrauma and Diverse Child Populations 883the high exposure of minority youth to negative social determinants of health, such as poverty and adverse living environments, it is imperative that we invest in preventiveapproaches and as much as possible shore up protective factors to buffer against inevitable stress and trauma in distressed, diverse communities. We must also antic- ipate posttraumatic mental health needs by providing early intervention to eliminate, orat least mitigate, the impact on development and adult outcomes. Future research should explore culturally tailored approaches to intervention and determine promising practices to maximize posttrauma resilience. Psychiatrists and other mental health professionals must develop relationships across systems and sectors. These outreach efforts include establishing liaisonrelationships with educational systems, pediatric and adolescent medicine, andfaith-based groups to reduce the stigma of mental health help seeking, providepsychological education about the impact of trauma and useful models of treatment (ie, emotional first aid), and maximize our reach for case finding as early as possible so that we may address, in a timely fashion, posttraumatic mental health needs in chil-dren and youth to achieve optimal outcomes.
