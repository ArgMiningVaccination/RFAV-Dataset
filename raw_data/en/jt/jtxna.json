[Acupuncture is a traditional Chinese medical practice](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/wellness-and-prevention/acupuncture#:~:text=Acupuncture%20is%20part%20of%20the,connected%20by%20pathways%20or%20meridians.) that involves inserting extremely thin needles into specific points on the body to promote energy flow and alleviate pain. When administered correctly, treatment is extremely safe with very few side effects. This practice enhances wellness by restoring the body's natural balance without drugs or injections. Many people seek alternative care to maximize pain relief and boost overall health through natural treatments and holistic healing. Rebalance Energy To Improve Wellness According to ancient Chinese medicine, our bodies contain networks of energy channels known as meridians. A special kind of energy called qi (pronounced \"chee\") flows through these network channels to nourish muscles and internal organs. When meridians are blocked, they can cause an imbalance in qi and lead to an imbalance in your body, leading to pain or illness. Our practitioners rebalance energy flow with proper needle insertion, needle manipulation, and needle removal. What To Expect During Your Appointment When you come in for your first appointment, the acupuncturist will discuss your condition and review your medical history. We will examine you for areas that will react the best to acupuncture. Depending on the nature of your condition and its location in your body, the needles are gently tapped into points into your skin throughout the body. - The needles themselves are as thin as a single strand of hair. - We insert needles at various depths, from a fraction of an inch to a couple of inches. - The needles stay in for a few minutes or as long as 20 minutes. - Safety is important to us. All of the needles are sterile and never used again on another patient (disposable). You may feel a small prick with each needle, although some patients report feeling nothing at all. Acupuncture is less painful than the feeling when you get a vaccine or blood draw as the diameter of the needles is so small. Supported By Modern Science & Research [Modern science supports acupuncture therapy's health benefits](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/wellness-and-prevention/acupuncture#:~:text=Acupuncture%20points%20are%20believed%20to,physical%20and%20emotional%20well%2Dbeing.). When needles are inserted into distinct body areas, they can stimulate the nervous, endocrine, and immune systems. This stimulation causes your brain and body to release chemicals and hormones that relax your muscles, reduce pain, and improve function.
