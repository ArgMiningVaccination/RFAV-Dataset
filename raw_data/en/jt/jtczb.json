Some types of international travel, especially to developing countries and rural areas, may have higher health risks. These risks depend on a number of things including: - Where you are traveling. - Your activities while traveling. - The state of your health. - Your vaccination history Many vaccine-preventable diseases that have become rare in the United States, such as measles and pertussis, are still common in other parts of the world.
