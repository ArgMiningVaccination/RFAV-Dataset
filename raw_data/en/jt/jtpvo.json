Next Level Programs of Study courses will improve the quality of CTE courses through updated, more relevant standards directly aligned to postsecondary certificate programs whenever possible. The courses have also been restructured to improve the consistency of CTE course delivery . The Office of CTE encourages schools to transition to the Next Level Programs of Study courses as soon as possible for students beginning a path way because of the inherent benefits the courses provide to students . Next Level Programs of Study will provide students the opportunity to complete up to one year's worth of a postsecondary program through a four (4) course sequence. The first three cou rses of each program of study will consist of a principles course and two advanced courses required to earn CTE Concentrator status. The three courses may be taken individually or can be completed concurrently for programs that are able to offer extended t raining sessions. Beginning in the 2022 -2023 school year, each program of study will also include a capstone course that may be taken for up to 6 credits. To learn more about the Next Level Programs of Study, please visit the Indiana Governor's Workforce Cabinet NLPS resource page , including our NLPS FAQ . Next Level Programs of Study 2 NLPS Review Document Revision Date: May 28, 2021 The purpose of the NLPS Review Document is to provide educators the opportunity to view the 4 -course sequence for each Next Level Program of Study in its entirety. Individuals can also find the competencies for each course, postsecondary course alignment, and various other course informa tion. The latest version of the NLPS Review Document includes these updates : Courses available for dual credit o Dual credit availability can be found in the \"Postsecondary Course Alignment\" box under each course. Courses not available for dual credit are denoted in italics, courses available for dual credit are in regular font. A few courses have been identified wi th a caret symbol (^) in the Postsecondary Course Alignment box. Courses that are designated with this symbol are Vincennes University courses that are offered through Project Excel. These courses are still being reviewed to determine if they will be available for dual credit with NLPS courses. Project Excel courses that are not identified with a caret (^), have been approved for dual credit use with NLPS. The status of Project Excel courses does not prevent these courses from being offered for dual cre dit through an Early College agreement with Vincennes University. The following programs of study have been further developed : o Education Professions, Aviation Management, Cybersecurity, Networking, Diesel Technology, and Industrial Maintenance Technicia n - Mechanical.
