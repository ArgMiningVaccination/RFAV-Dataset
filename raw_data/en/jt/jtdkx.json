A wide range of therapies and treatments exists under the term 'complementary therapy', which makes it difficult to supply a blanket definition. Complementary therapies are used besides conventional medicines or treatments. [Alternative therapies](https://www.alliedacademies.org/allied-journal-of-medical-research/submit-manuscript.php) are sometimes grouped with complementary therapies, but they ask different concepts. Alternative therapies are utilized in place of conventional medicines or [treatments](https://www.alliedacademies.org/covid-19-peer-reviewed-journals-articles-special-issues.php). Here is evidence to support the utilization of some [complementary therapies](https://www.alliedacademies.org/allied-journal-of-medical-research/inpress.php), but alternative therapies are typically unproven or are shown to be ineffective. There is no scientific or medical evidence for a few complementary therapies and lots of alternative therapies, and that they could also be unsafe or cause harmful side effects. Conventional medicine is based on rigorous science and evaluation.
