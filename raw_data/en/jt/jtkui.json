Food, supplements, proper breathing techniques as well as movement and rest all represent important elements in the never-ending journey of well-being. Still, the suggestion that all we have to do is leverage these types of somatic strategies to maintain our health is not entirely accurate. While it is obvious and beyond dispute that nutrition, exercise, relaxation and respiration are important components of maintaining our corporal condition \u2014 as is stabilizing blood sugar and employing correct digestive strategies \u2014 our [emotions and thoughts](https://www.gaia.com/video/e-motion) are just as significant! And, the foundation of healthful thoughts and emotions is [self-kindness](https://www.gaia.com/series/thrive-self-healing-ayurveda)! The physiological benefits of self-kindness are rooted in the human neurology of the 10th cranial nerve which starts in the brain and travels throughout the body, affecting various structures and organ systems. Known as the Vagus nerve, this neurological pathway can be consciously harnessed via self-talk for numerous physiological benefits including lowering blood pressure, strengthening the heart, supporting digestion, stimulating growth and repair, enhancing creativity, and boosting the immune system. The relationship between seemingly imprecise emotional aspects of wellness, and the functioning of the Vagus nerve is so clear-cut that scientists have learned to measure self-kindness by monitoring vagal activity. You can always tell if someone is being kind to themselves by how they treat others. Kind and loving internal dialogue will manifest externally as loving relationships and a healthy body, while hostile self-talk will show up in relationships and a physical body that are out of ease. The inner self is innocent and guileless like a [small child](https://www.gaia.com/video/power-play). Try taking control of your inner dialogue and talking to yourself as you would to a baby or a child. If you like, you can even use baby talk at least for a little bit! Treating oneself with gentleness and understanding is an indicator of inner strength, as well as a sign and precursor of good physical well-being. On the other hand, lack of compassion and self-compassion are always rooted in insecurity, uncertainty and angst, and subsequently leads to the protective posture that results in the defensive (inflammatory) response that is the ultimate cause of all disease. The bottom line is physical health results from [more than the physical](https://www.gaia.com/video/human-riddle); it's just as dependent on our thoughts and emotions. Be kind to yourself and others! It will reflect in your body vitality and quality of life. Next Article Antibiotic-Resistant Superbugs No Match for Ancient Irish Soil Researchers studying the properties of a particular soil in Ireland found it effectively treated four of the top six antibiotic-resistant superbugs scientists estimate [could lead to millions of deaths in coming years](https://www.gaia.com/article/antibiotic-resistance-is-becoming-a-major-threat-to-humanity) \u2014 a problem the World Health Organization described as \"'one of the biggest threats to global health, food security, and development today.\" And as it just so happens, the location of this soil was once home to the legendary, ancient Druids. This \"new\" strain of bacteria found in the townland of Toneel North in Boho, County Fermanagh was given the name Streptomyces sp. myrophorea, though its potent medicinal properties have been known to locals for some time, and likely to [those inhabiting the area as far back as 4,000 years ago.](https://www.gaia.com/article/the-remains-of-foreigners-buried-at-stonehenge-add-to-its-mystery) Before discovering its profound antibiotic properties, scientists considered the soil to be an ethnopharmacological medicine, a.k.a. a folk cure - something locals swore by, but of which nothing was known by mainstream medicine. And now that its curative functions have been officially documented, the science community may start to shift its outlook toward similar folk cures. \"Our results show that folklore and traditional medicines are worth investigating in the search for new antibiotics. Scientists, historians and archaeologists can all have something to contribute to this task. It seems that part of the answer to this very modern problem might lie in the wisdom of the past,\" one of the paper's co-authors, [Prof. Paul Dyson](https://phys.org/news/2018-12-bacteria-ancient-irish-soil-halts.html) of Swansea University, said. The antibiotic properties of the soil were found to treat bacteria including: - Acinetobacter baumannii - Enterococcus faecium - Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) - Klebsiella pneumoniae Locals have long used the dirt to treat toothaches and other infections by placing soil wrapped in cloth by their heads or near an infection at bedtime. The soil would be left for nine nights before returning it to where it was originally found \u2014 a seemingly superstitious remedy the average scientist might have scoffed at in the past. Researchers involved in [the study](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2018.02458/full) said they found documentation of the soil's therapeutic properties dating back to 1815, though they recognized it was an [area once home to the storied Druids](https://www.gaia.com/article/who-were-the-ancient-druids). It was even a significant place for Neolithic people living in the area centuries prior \u2014 the same people who created the fascinating engravings on the megalithic Reyfad Stones. The precise mechanisms behind the soil's treatment of these superbugs is still unclear, though scientists are working quickly to find them, while also seeing what other bugs and ailments it could be effective against. \"We will now concentrate on the purification and identification of these antibiotics. We have also discovered additional antibacterial organisms from the same soil cure which may cover a broader spectrum of multi-resistant pathogens,\" Dyson said. And now that this discovery, once thought tantamount to an old wives' remedy, has heralded a major lifesaving scientific breakthrough, maybe scientists will pay more attention to the millennia-old wisdom of eastern and alternative medicines.
