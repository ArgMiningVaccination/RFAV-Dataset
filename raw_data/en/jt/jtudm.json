By October 2011, the project had treated more than 30,000 items and trained more than 100 Haitians. The Haiti Cultural Recovery Project was organized by the Smithsonian Institution with the Government of Haiti, Ministry of Culture and Communication, and the Presidential Commission for the Emergency and Reconstruction, in partnership with the U.S. President's Committee on the Arts and the Humanities. The project has been supported by the U.S. Department of State through U.S. AID, National Endowment for the Arts, National Endowment for the Humanities, Institute of Museum and Library Services, and The Broadway League and Broadway community. Additional funding has been provided by Af rmation Arts Fund, Peggy Burnet, Smithsonian magazine, National Haitian Art Society, Macondo Gallery, Waterloo Center for the Arts, Friends of the Art Center, Jerome and Thao Dodson, Paul Peck, and Henry Louis Gates, Jr. Program part-ners included the U.S. Committee of the Blue Shield, the Foundation of the American Institute for Conservation of Historic and Artistic Works, Fondation Connaissance et Libert\u00e9 (FOKAL), the International Centre for the Study of the Preservation and Restoration of Cultural Property (ICCROM), UNESCO, and the William J. Clinton Presidential Center. The project was managed by the Smithsonian Institution. FOKAL served as scal agent in Haiti. The Haitian government Steering Committee consisted of the Institut de Sauvegarde du Patrimoine National and Bureau National d'Ethnologie (BNE). The Haiti Cultural Recovery Project was a broad-based collaborative effort, achieving an ex- traordinary result in the aftermath of an unprecedented disaster. All of those who supported the project, worked at or deployed to the Cultural Recovery Center in Port-au-Prince, or oth-erwise contributed are recognized through the book and in the appendices, and are to be congratulated for their good and timely service to help save Haiti's cultural heritage. As the project neared its end, Richard Kurin, the Smithsonian's Under Secretary for History, Art, and Culture, nominated the Cultural Recovery Center's Manager and Chief Conservator for special recognition. Secretary Wayne Clough awarded the Gold Medal for Exemplary Service to Olsen Jean Julien and Stephanie Hornbeck. This rarely given honor recognizes extraordinary achievement in service of the best ideals of the Smithsonian Institution.

I expected the damages and loss of life to be extensive, but nonetheless, was not able to fully anticipate the extensive destruction that actually occurred. At the Smithsonian, our hearts went out to the people of Haiti, particularly since many people there had previously worked with us. We knew we had to help, and that our assistance should be shaped around a cultural relief effort, something that others were not doing and did not have the capacity to do. We also had a unique, powerful asset, Richard Kurin, our Under Secretary for History, Art, and Culture, who had extensive contacts with a number of key people in Haiti and saw this effort as a call to duty. It turned out that offering aid is one thing, but getting it done is quite another. Sometimes luck helps. First Lady Michelle Obama, who had publicly expressed an interest in helping Haiti, visited the Smithsonian soon after the earthquake, and she and I had a moment be-hind the scenes where I mentioned our intentions. She said she would help and shortly we found a strong ally in the President's Committee on the Arts and the Humanities. Our joint efforts brought together the leading cultural institutions of our nation, including the National Endowment for the Humanities, National Endowment for the Arts, and Institute of Museum and Library Services. Coupled with the U.S. Committee of the Blue Shield and the American Institute for Conservation of Historic and Artistic Works, and with the support of the U.S. Department of State, these like-minded institutions formed a team working with key friends and organizations in Haiti to create the Haiti Cultural Recovery Center. As word of the initiative spread at the Smithsonian, employees across the Institution pitched in to help, including members of our facilities group who helped establish our base in Haiti. In time, dozens of curators and conservators from the Smithsonian and other cultural or-ganizations served as volunteers at the Cultural Recovery Center to aid in stabilizing and restoring art, and to train Haitians to carry on the work. Today more than 30,000 works of art and culture have been stabilized and this number will increase over time. It is a remarkable accomplishment. I have visited Haiti twice to see the work of the Cultural Recovery Center rst hand. One strong impression\u2014in spite of the enormous destruction\u2014the Haitian people remain resource-ful. On my rst visit to Port-au-Prince, as a group of us stood in the rubble of what once was a magni cent Cathedral, we heard music. Behind the rubble and under the roof of a rough enclosure, a Haitian children's choir and orchestra were practicing. This same choir toured the U.S. and performed publicly at our National Museum of American History in a testament to the power of hope. As the Secretary of the Smithsonian, I could not be more proud of the work of our people who generously gave their time and worked under challenging conditions. I am profoundly grateful to my colleague Richard Kurin for his leadership, our partner organizations and their leaders who helped us in so many ways, and First Lady Michelle Obama who believed in the promise of our plans. Finally, I express my great admiration for our friends in Haiti who believed in the effort and without whose advice, support, and help we could not have done the work. Someone asked me what I thought the long-term impact of our work would be. U.S. Senator Patrick Leahy of Vermont, a Smithsonian Regent with a long standing interest in Haiti, said it best, \"Fifty or a hundred years from now no one will remember that the United States gave several billion dollars in aid to Haiti, but the Haitians will remember that the Smithsonian helped save their history and art.\" G. Wayne Clough Secretary of the Smithsonian NOT FOR SALE OR REPRODUCTION10 SAVING HAITI'S HERITAGE The Haiti Cultural Recovery Project has sought to rescue, recover, safeguard, and help restore Haitian artwork, artifacts, documents, media, and architectural features damaged and endan-gered by the catastrophic January 12, 2010 earthquake and its aftermath. This book documents that effort. It tells the story of how\u2014in the midst of one of the most devastating tragedies in human histo- ry\u2014dedicated, caring professionals from Haiti, the United States, and indeed, around the world, came together to help people save their culture. Ultimately that good work is part of an ongoing process, profoundly enmeshed in Haitian society and truly in Haitian hands. Yet, given the emergency situation resulting from the earthquake, the Haiti Cultural Recovery Project was a necessary and vital means of assisting Haitians in that task. The project took shape in the days that followed the earthquake. It developed in tangible form as the Haiti Cultural Recovery Center, or Centre de Sauvetage de Biens Culturels as it was known in Haiti\u2014a three-story building and compound in the Bourdon section of Port-au-Prince, equipped with conservation studios and storage facilities, and work site for dozens of Haitian, American, and international conservators, trainees, managers, and support staff. The project achieved many of its goals, and continued its work through 2011. During its course, the project treated more than 30,000 cultural items, including more than 4,500 paintings and 500 works on paper, some 3,500 artifacts and sculptures, 17,000 rare books, and thousands of historical and archival documents. In some cases, items were literally pulled out of the rubble. In other cases, items were cleaned and safely stored. Still others received more advanced conservation treatment, ranging from minor repairs to full restoration. Among the treasures of Haitian heritage saved were the surviving murals at Holy Trinity Episcopal Cathedral and virtually the whole collection of the famed Centre d'Art. The project treated col-lections from a number of galleries including Hyppolite masterpieces from the Nader Museum, Marianne Lehmann's world renowned collection of Vodou art and artifacts, rare books from the collection of Georges Corvington and those of the National Library of Haiti. In addition, the project supported improvements in storage and climate control at MUPANAH, Haiti's National Museum, and worked with ISPAN, the national heritage organization, in securing and treating public architectural ornamentation. Importantly, from its inception, the project offered numerous courses, workshops, and appren- ticeships in conservation and collection management to more than 100 Haitian participants so as to build local capacity to carry on the work. Additionally, the project generated a documentary lm for television, a major cover article in Smithsonian magazine, a website, exhibitions in New York, in Washington at the National Museum of African Art, and at the Clinton Presidential Center in Little Rock, along with other programs and events. The project generated considerable media coverage\u2014including several New York Times and CNN features, and brought to public attention the fact that Haiti\u2014despite the earthquake, poverty, and other ills\u2014is nonetheless a land of incredible people possessed of unconquerable spirit and immense creative talents. Now, the primary impetus for continuing and leading the work initiated by the project rests in Haiti. Thanks to a commitment from the Government of Haiti and additional support from the U.S. Department of State/U.S. AID the project will transition to life as a Haitian institution. Happily, relationships developed through the project are likely to result in continued collabora-tion with and support from those well beyond Haiti's shore. The Haiti Cultural Recovery Project was organized by the Smithsonian Institution with the Government of Haiti, Ministry of Culture and Communication, and the Presidential Commission for the Emergency and Reconstruction, in partnership with the U.S. President's Committee on the Arts and the Humanities. The project has been supported by the U.S. Department of State through U.S. AID, National Endowment for the Arts, National Endowment for the Humanities, PREFACE NOT FOR SALE OR REPRODUCTION11 SAVING HAITI'S HERITAGEInstitute of Museum and Library Services, and The Broadway League and Broadway community. Additional funding has been provided by Af rmation Arts Fund, Peggy Burnet, Smithsonian mag- azine, National Haitian Art Society, Macondo Gallery, Waterloo Center for the Arts, Friends of the Art Center, Jerome and Thao Dodson, Paul Peck, and Henry Louis Gates, Jr. Program partners included the U.S. Committee of the Blue Shield, the Foundation of the American Institute for Conservation, Fondation Connaissance et Libert\u00e9 (FOKAL), the International Centre for the Study of the Preservation and Restoration of Cultural Property (ICCROM), UNESCO, and the William J. Clinton Presidential Center. The project was managed by the Smithsonian Institution. FOKAL served as scal agent in Haiti. The Haiti government Steering Committee consisted of the Institut de Sauvegarde du Patrimoine National and Bureau National d'Ethnologie (BNE). Numerous non-governmental cultural organizations in Haiti provided advice and guidance. Many people are responsible for the existence and the accomplishments of the project. I have tried to acknowledge all in this volume. There were a few key people whose leadership made the crucial difference in the initiation of the project and bringing it to fruition. The First Lady of Haiti, Elisabeth Pr\u00e9val, and the First Lady of the United States, Michelle Obama, both immedi-ately grasped the signi cance and importance of safeguarding Haiti's cultural heritage and lent their support and prestige to the project from its outset. In Haiti, Patrick Delatour, Minister of Tourism and Chair of the Haitian Presidential Commission for the Emergency and Reconstruction, and Marie-Laurence Jocelyn Lass\u00e8gue, Minister of Culture and Communication, provided the leadership; Mich\u00e8le Pierre-Louis and Lorraine Mangon\u00e8s, respectively President and Executive Director of FOKAL, provided organizational sup-port and Geri Benoit, currently Haiti's Ambassador to Italy and formerly Commissioner for the Smithsonian's Folklife Festival on Haiti, supplied contacts and encouragement. Olsen Jean Julien provided the continual and attentive management for the project, and Patrick Vilaire the inspira-tion as well as hands-on involvement in its various activities. For the Smithsonian, Secretary Wayne Clough provided the leadership and encouragement for me to proceed. Our efforts were thoroughly supported by Rachel Goslins, the Executive Director of the President's Committee on the Arts and the Humanities. Cheryl Mills, Counselor and Chief of Staff to Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, played a key role in enabling the project and seeing it through. Corine Wegener, the President of the U.S. Committee of the Blue Shield was instru-mental in motivating and developing the project. Stephanie Hornbeck, who had retired from the Smithsonian only a week before the earthquake, answered the call to serve in Haiti and led the expert conservation effort. That effort was supported by dozens of conservators and collec-tions managers across the Smithsonian and by conservators organized by Eryl Wentworth and Eric Pourchot at the American Institute for Conservation. I am grateful to these colleagues, and believe that future generations of Haitians will appreciate their efforts as well.

Je suis reconnaissant NOT FOR SALE OR REPRODUCTIONAt 4:53 p.m. on Tuesday, January 12, 2010 , an earthquake registering 7.0 on the Richter scale struck Haiti. Centered in the region of Port-au-Prince, the nation's capital, it lasted for thirty- ve seconds. As Haitians immediately experienced, the result was catastrophic. According to the Haitian government, more than 300,000 people may have been killed in the earthquake and its aftermath. Hundreds of thousands of others were injured. More than a million Haitians were displaced from their homes. The nation's infrastructure, fragile before the disaster, was devastated. Hardest hit was L\u00e9og\u00e2ne, closest to the epicenter, Port-au-Prince, and nearby Jacmel. Thirty- ve seconds! The National Palace, residence of Haiti's president, was severely damaged in the earthquake.

For most Haitians and for the country itself, the January 12 earthquake means a milestone that marks the border with a completely different life. For most children, adults, and families, it seems that things will never be the same again. In addition to the loved ones that we lost, the family house that has been patiently built with savings of a generation, the school that our parents, grandparents, and ourselves attended, the church of the neighborhood where a small com-munity of family and friends use to meet every weekend, all this has vanished before our eyes in a matter of a few seconds. Life will never be the same again. Thirty- ve short seconds that seemed like an eternity. A few seconds suf cient enough to bring our of cial residence down, collapsing slowly at our feet, ve feet away from where I was standing; this huge cloud of dust rising from the city below carrying desperate cries of sorrow and calls for help; crowds of wounded children and adults turned white with the dust, running around, not knowing exactly where to go. And nobody to help. With more than seventy percent of the population living under the poverty line, life was already pre- carious and dif cult for the majority of Haitians. The January 12 disaster brings much more privation, much more struggling to cover even the most basic human needs. There is hope at the horizon because of the huge machine of disaster relief set up by the international community. I discovered later that a great number of people from very remote countries of the world's continents\u2014even those with very limited resources\u2014have contributed their support to the Haitians. It is as if the January 12 disaster had brought all these people together; as if there was the sudden realization that the whole planet was a small village and those Haitians in need were part of the same small community. President Obama declared, \"we are all Haitians today!\" But Haitians fear that such solidarity might be just a temporary generous reaction; that the structures in place in the country will not be able to take over; that hell may come back again as a daily pattern of life. The rebuilding of Haiti will need the support of the international community and a long-term com- mitment to be present alongside the Haitians to help face the challenges of rebuilding differently and creating solid, accessible, and ef cient public services. The rebuilding process will need above all the commitment of Haitians themselves in enhancing our sense of dialogue and our culture of solidarity to preserve our institutions. Elisabeth D. Pr\u00e9val earned her MBA from George Washington University and is the former First Lady of Haiti. 17 HAITI AND ITS HERITAGE IN RUINS NOT FOR SALE OR REPRODUCTIONThe effects in Port-au-Prince were particularly harsh. Decades ago, the city was home to only a few hundred thousand inhabitants. Due to a host of policies, rural people from around the country had fl ocked to the city for jobs and opportunities, swelling the popula- tion to over three million. T ens of thousands of homes were built on the sides of the city's hills and in poor slums\u2014basically shanty towns with makeshift materi- als and with no regard to building codes. Many homes were built on unstable land, lled-in areas that had suf- fered subsidence problems. People were killed by falling rubble and debris. This made the earthquake profoundly democratic, as not only the poor suffered massive losses. More well-off Haitians lived in houses made of concrete, and when these too came down, inhabitants were crushed inside. Wood houses, built at the turn of the last century and preserved as historical buildings in the capital, replete with their gingerbread decoration, generally survived best\u2014the wood swaying with the tremors rather than giving way. Immediately, Haitians went to the rescue of their families, friends, and neighbors. Thousands were physi- cally pulled from the rubble by Haitian hands. Those with tools and equipment used them to leverage con-crete, pry refuse, chip away brick, and crack cinder block in order to locate survivors and clear them from collapsed houses, workplaces, schools, and stores. For some, rescuing relatives meant sawing away limbs under the most primitive of conditions. It was horrid and heartbr eaking. Many Haitians had even grimmer tasks. They sought to remove loved ones killed in the earthquake. In some areas of Port-au-Prince, bodies were brought out and stacked like cordwood. Relatives wore makeshift masks and used scented cloth and cotton to disguise the smell of death. Others had to bear the sorrow of deceased family members buried in rubble they could not remove. Neither they nor their loved ones could rest in peace. In the rst days, people set up makeshift \"homes\" outside, on the streets, in parks, and in open fields. Survivors scavenged for food. Rumors of more destruc- tion spread surprisingly quickly through the city. One was that the region would be hit by a tsunami trig- gered by the earthquake. Such had actually occurred in the 1770 earthquake that struck Port-au-Prince. Now, Haitians looked for nearby trees to climb in case a giant tidal wave fl ooded the city. That rumor and the fear it occasioned is captured brilliantly by Galland Semerand in a painting completed in the days that followed. The canvas depicts a beautiful, almost idyllically peaceful, verdant Port-au-Prince with light pastel and rainbow colors. Y et close inspection reveals collapsed buildings, upturned vehicles, and a tree of life and death. The tree is littered with dead bodies. In nightmarish fashion, Haitians climb up the trunk of the tree, crawling over their deceased neighbors seeking higher ground, sur- vival, and even solace as they approach the sun. \"Everyone was covered in grey dust,\" said one survivor, referring to the pervasive pulverized concrete cloud that engulfed several neighborhoods. \"It was like we were all ghosts. We weren't even sure we were really alive.\" [Left] The earthquake was centered in the Port-au-Prince region. Map by USAID [Right] In a haunting painting by Galland Semerand, a tree of life and death evokes local fears of a tsunami in the aftermath of the earthquake.

Whether laments, prayers or songs of woe, ritual meals or the donning of funerary garments, it is the only way we can give meaning to the awful, and go on living without descending into total despair or madness. Those rst nights after the earthquake were desper- ate ones. Haitians lamented the dead. When they could, they conducted burial rites in typical fashion, often a mix of Catholicism and Haitian Vodou. Bodies that were not carted off out of the city for mass burial were put in cof ns, family and neighborhood burial sites\u2014until they ran out of room. At nightfall, with no homes to go to, Haitians took to the streets\u2014and sang. Hymns and anthems were sung for hours collectively by thousands and thousands. Frightened but together, joined by trag-edy, a society survived without food, water, or shelter by singing through the night. The will to survive, to overcome immense hardship and deprivation is at the heart of what is often characterized as resilience\u2014a social trait honed over Haiti's long history. Quickly, within a day, the world beyond Haiti began to witness the horror of the earthquake and its aftermath as the media rushed in to report. T elevision coverage by CNN and others captured both the awesome scale of the destruction as well as the intimate drama of its impact upon the injured, dispossessed, and stunned survivors. Impressively, nations and people around the planet reacted in an amazing outpouring of empathy and support. Rescue teams, doctors, nurses, soldiers, and engineers were sent by scores of nations. The airport had to be re-opened by the U.S. military with temporary equipment. Food and water, medicine, tarps, and supplies came in by plane, ship, and helicopter, and overland by truck from the neighboring Dominican Republic. The massive and logistically complicated effort saved countless lives. It also provided hope to Haitians. Despondent over their losses, they could take heart that the world cared. Whatever cause might be attributed to the earthquake, whether the antipathy of nature or the mystery of divine will, Haitians would soon learn that their fellow human beings from around the planet wanted to help them survive. The earthquake took its toll on every aspect of Haitian life. It devastated Haiti's rich cultural heritage. Historic buildings, museums, libraries, archives, galler-ies, churches, theaters, artists' workshops, and market-places were damaged and in many cases destroyed. The National Cathedral, a towering pink and white edi ce in downtown Port-au-Prince, looked like it had been struck by bombs. Half of the historic Centre d'Art col-lapsed, each floor like a layered cake brought to the ground. The other half stood like an eerie anatomical cut-away, its walls stripped away. The Nader Museum, with more than 16,000 paintings, was leveled. The his- toric section of Jacmel\u2014on the list to be recognized as a world heritage site\u2014suffered acute damage and lay in ruins. Libraries, archives, and galleries were covered in dust, disrupted and endangered. 20 HAITI AND ITS HERITAGE IN RUINS NOT FOR SALE OR REPRODUCTION[Above] Haitians mourned their loved ones and buried them in cemeteries that rapidly ran out of room.

Port-au-Prince was devastated. It wasn't the rst capital city to have suffered such a fate, but with the magic of modern media, images of destruction raced around the world quickly. Its scale was massive, and it had a huge audience. The whole world became a village, a giant lakou or Haitian courtyard in which all could be seen. In Haiti, the earthquake of January 12 shook us like the trumpet that awakens an entire garrison. The moment is now enshrined indelibly in our memory. Everyone was enveloped in it, and everyone was desperate to extricate themselves from the cloud of dust that chokes, the look of disbelief of one who knows its horrors. Port-au-Prince, L\u00e9og\u00e2ne, Petit Goave and Jacmel suffered unprecedented destruction. In Port- au-Prince the Capital was gone, the National Palace, the Palace of the Ministries, the Law Courts, the Legislative Building, City Hall. The National Cathedral, the Cathedral of the Holy Trinity Church, and the Church of Saint Louis de Gonzague, were erased. The Iron Market, the General Tax Directorate, banking institutions, universities all destroyed. The capital, laboriously developed between 1915 and 1934 was wiped off the map. Only the broad avenues of its core\u2014famed throughout the Caribbean\u2014remained, and offered rare views toward the bay in a dramatic, almost beautiful, if disturbing way. Due to long term policies of over-centralization, the city had become a megalopolis of absurd proportions, a place of urban disorder and intense improvisation\u2014which helps explain the magnitude of the disaster that betrayed the promise of a better life for its citizenry. With hundreds of thousands dead, more injured, and even more homeless, this was the Apocalypse.Days after the earthquake I was given the responsibility by the President to chair the Commission for the Emergency and Reconstruction, to conduct a comprehensive inventory of the destruction to public buildings, places of worship, schools and universities, hospitals, private homes and businesses, hotels, roads and infrastructure. The results were overwhelming and damning\u2014the \"volume of debris\" became our measuring instrument. More than 300,000 homes were destroyed. There was enough debris to perhaps ll a dozen superdomes. Yet, with all in ruins, all seeming lost, the survival instinct is strongest of all, and our heritage gave it shape. We had to persevere and move ahead. But how? Questions were asked. Should we rebuild the capital or move it elsewhere? Should we build upon our heritage or build a new heritage for future generations? What of the rubble should we keep and what of it should we discard? At a time of crisis, such as the January 12 earthquake, a people decide what is most important to them.

Workers at the National Library boxed up books that had been dislodged by overturned shelves. Centre d'Art staff members climbed up the remains of their once proud headquarters, now three stories of rubble, to pull out surviving paintings and cut metal sculptures. Georges Nader and members of his family did the same at their leveled museum. At an Episcopal school, parents and teachers climbed into a precariously listing, terribly damaged building, in order to retrieve musical instruments dear to their children.

Photo by Stephen Davenport 25 HAITIANS TO THE RESCUE NOT FOR SALE OR REPRODUCTIONPROTECTING THE SURVIVING MURALS PATRICK VILAIRE The Holy Trinity Episcopal Cathedral, with a long history in Haiti, was home to invaluable artistic murals until its roof and walls collapsed in the earthquake. The Cathedral had fourteen larger than life-size murals painted on its walls in the early 1950s by some of Haiti's master painters associated with the Centre d'Art. Only three survived the earthquake in recognizable, though damaged form\u2014the Baptism by Castera Bazile, the Last Supper by Philom\u00e9 Obin, and Native Procession by Pr\u00e9f\u00e8te Duffaut. Protecting the murals to assure their survival was a dif cult task because the building had completely collapsed. Local technicians, under my supervision, tried to secure the perimeter to limit access to the murals and possible looting. We constructed a wooden scaffold to help support the damaged walls with the murals that had been left standing. We rigged plastic sheeting over the top of the scaffold to protect the frescoes from the elements. We also col-lected many fragments of the murals that had been damaged and destroyed, and secured them, so they could be used in restoring the art work. Additionally, we saved some ornamental ceramics, by Jasmin Joseph, decorating the arches of the Cathedral and the remains of the terribly damaged church organ. It was our hope at the time that the murals could be saved and restored, and thus appreciated as part of Haitian and human patrimony. Patrick Vilaire, a sculptor, specialist in ceramics, and the use of new energy sources, is President of the Foundation for Iconographic Research and Documentation, and the Founder of Gataphy.

Photo by Richard Kurin/Smithsonian 26 HAITIANS TO THE RESCUE NOT FOR SALE OR REPRODUCTIONAnother cultural leader, Daniel Elie, the Director of ISPAN\u2014Haiti's cultural heritage bureau, sought to document the destruction. This was not easy for him to do. His office was destroyed. He lost several members of his staff. T elephone service, spotty before the earthquake, was overwhelmed. His government vehicle was crushed. Nonetheless he raced around the capital region, camera in hand, to document the status of cultural sites, publishing the ISPAN Bulletin digitally and distributing it on the world wide web so that friends and specialists every-where would have a well-documented report on the status of Haiti's built heritage. Why? Why were these Haitians so concerned with the survival of their cultural heritage in light of what must have seemed like overwhelming, basic concerns? Haitians have long understood the importance of their culture as the keystone of their society and rooted deeply in a complex, dramatic history. This is the identity of the Haitian people. If we let this go, the next generation in Haiti will not know where they came from. It was a duty we had to ful ll.\u2014Gerald Alexis, art historian NOT FOR SALE OR REPRODUCTIONHAITI'S HISTORY Haiti's ancestors\u2014overwhelmingly people of African descent, began their history on the island soon after Columbus' voyages. Columbus, who came in 1492 and again in 1493 , named the island\u2014at that time occupied by indigenous Taino people, La Isla Espa\u00f1ola , later popularized as \"Hispaniola.\" Columbus and his compatriots found gold. In establishing a colonial outpost, the Spanish needed labor for mining gold, building forti cations, and farming. The native Tainos, massacred in resistance to colonial rule and easy prey to diseases brought by the conquistadores , did not serve the purpose. The Spanish looked toward Africa and started importing slaves in 1501. By the end of the sixteenth century, the population included about 1,000 Spaniards and 12,000 people of African descent. Spanish settlement became concentrated in Santo Domingo, which became not only the name of the colonial town on the island's southeastern coast, but also that of the whole colony. Pirates and other colonial powers established outposts on the less inhabited parts of the island and in 1665, King Louis XV recognized Saint Domingue as a French colony. T obacco drew the rst French colonial settlers, fol- lowed by indigo and sugar cane cultivation. Slave labor was needed, and expanded. In 1697, with the Treaty of Ryswick, the Spanish recognized the French claim on the western third of the island. The Treaty opened the way for large-scale immi- gration of French colonialists\u2014some 40,000 over the next century. The massive growth in plantation agri-culture produced increasingly lucrative sugar cane, indigo, and later coffee and cotton for export. Saint Domingue's colonial plantation economy depended upon enslaved Africans and their descendants who would work the elds, grow, harvest, process, and ready for transport their agricultural produce. Overseen by colonial of cials, plantation owners, and white workers, the African population maintained oral traditions from their native lands, particularly religious and spiritual ones. This was no easy feat, as they were stripped of clothing and every tangible possession that might pos-sibly remind them of their homes. They were discour-aged from learning and speaking their mother tongues, and so their languages died out, though words and phrases fused with the colonial French and became a new language, Krey\u00f2l. Plantation slavery in Saint Domingue was partic- ularly brutal, inspiring a Haitian cultural historian to later point out that the long and harsh period of slavery prompted its people to hold more dearly the \"next life\" because this one was so bad. Refl ecting the Code Noir promulgated under French monarch Louis XIV , slaves were property and had abysmally few rights; they were subject to myriad abuses and humiliations. They could not freely marry, assemble, carry weapons, or engage in commerce. Forbidden from practicing anything but Catholicism, their beliefs were denigrated, and any sur-viving or adapted ritual practices hidden from public sight. Various forms of expression and communication, drumming, for example, were restricted. Slaves were purposefully kept illiterate. Inspired by the American and then the French Revolution, gens de couleur libres or free people of color, \"mixed race\" metis and mulattos in the colony and in the Caribbean rejected discrimination and advocated for more rights claiming they too were French citizens and subject to treatment under the 1789 Declaration of the Rights of Man and the Citizen. Slaves\u2014whose number had grown to more than 500,000, dwar ng the free white population\u2014grew rebellious. Revolts, long a feature of slave society, grew in scale in the north-ern, large plantation areas of Saint Domingue in 1791, forcing many French colonials to fl ee. A famed Vodou ceremony led by Dutty Boukman at Bois Ca\u00efman gave spiritual shape to the rebellion. Confl icts and alliances between rebel leaders, French, Spanish, and British colonial forces on the island ensued. French authorities abolished slavery in 1793 to gain the support of Black rebels against the Spanish and the British. Foremost among the rebel leaders was T oussaint Louverture, a former slave, wealthy freeman, and brilliant military strategist. Commanding an army of about 4,000 , he ultimately brought order to the colony, defeating the British and the Spanish and by 1801 taking control of the whole island. He invited back the colonial French hoping to revitalize plantation agriculture with the fair labor of freed slaves. He encouraged trade with the United States and European powers, promulgated a new colonial constitution so that all could live \"free and French,\" and declared himself governor-for-life. When Napoleon came to power, France's new ruler tried to reverse the course of the freedom movement, sending an army of 20,000 men to defeat Louverture, re-take the colony, and re-institute slavery. Though Louverture was captured, taken to France, and died in prison, his successor and mentee Jean-Jacques Dessalines fought Napoleon's army. Weakened by yel-low fever, the French troops were defeated. Capping the successful revolution, in 1804 Dessalines declared the former colony independent, giving it back the name Ayiti or Haiti, a Taino word meaning \"land of moun- tains,\" and though selected as Governor-General by other leaders, he declared himself Emperor later that year. Haiti became the first free Black independent nation in the Western Hemisphere. It still took years, even decades for this newly-won nation to ensure its boundaries. After Dessalines was assassinated in 1806, two of his fellow revolutionaries 28 HAITIANS TO THE RESCUE NOT FOR SALE OR REPRODUCTIONand successors, Henri Christophe and Alexandre P\u00e9tion divided up the nation, the former creating the state and then Kingdom of Haiti in the north and the latter the Republic of Haiti in the south. In 1809 , Spanish colo- nialists re-took the eastern part of the island, regaining the colony of Santo Domingo and later declaring inde-pendence. Henri Christophe built an elaborate palace and a fortress, to be known as \"The Citadel,\" to defend the country against re-conquest. Haiti was reunited again in 1820 and two years later took back the east until 1844 when a revolt led to the formation of the Dominican Republic. The revolutionary movement in Haiti had numer- ous consequences. In 1803 , Napoleon faced a hostile British navy. He knew that defending French ter-ritory in North America would be difficult given the need to send troops to Haiti to stem the revolt. As that effort failed, Napoleon could not depend upon any future revenue from the lucrative colony. With a war to fight in Europe, he consolidated his resources and sold France's land to the United States. The Louisiana Purchase and the territorial expansion of the United States is in part a legacy of the Haitian freedom movement. As slave-holding and trading was still practiced in the United States and through the Americas, other nations feared Haiti would provide an example to be seized upon by slaves and sympathizers. No country recognized Haiti's independence. France, Great Britain, and the United States imposed an embargo on trade with Haiti which crippled its economy. That was lifted in 1825 when France recognized Haiti in return for a payment of 150 million gold francs as a fee for prop- erty lost in the revolt. Though that amount was later reduced it was not paid off for decades. It took fty-eight years for the U.S. to acknowl- edge Haiti's sovereignty\u2014and in 1862, in the midst of Civil War, Abraham Lincoln recognized Haiti. Haiti had long become a symbol of freedom for many African Americans\u2014thousands emigrating there in the 1820s, others visiting in mid-century. Frederick Douglass became the U.S. emissary to Haiti in the late 1880 s. Haiti's Citadel is on the world heritage list. Located in the north, it was not damaged in the earthquake. Photo by G. Hyvert/ \u00a9 UNESCO 29 HAITIANS TO THE RESCUE NOT FOR SALE OR REPRODUCTIONInternational isolation bred in Haiti the neces- sity of self-reliance and turned much of its social and cultural life inward. Its people developed a strong ability to improvise and \"make do.\" The absence of civic institutions in the slave society prior to independence meant that the new nation lacked the infrastructural roots for transportation, communications, educational, civic, and political systems needed to develop into a healthy, growing nineteenth century nation. Unlike other nations of the Americas which achieved independence later in the century or those of Asia and Africa which won their freedom from colonial rule in the mid-twentieth century, Haiti had no structural base upon which to build a national economy or polity. This resulted in an ensuing lack of economic growth, industrialization, and modernization as well as political instability over the course of its history. There have been some periods of political stability and economic growth, as for example the last quarter of the nineteenth century, yet overall these have been short-lived. Persistent economic failure has produced endemic poverty; political failure produced ineffective government and public services. Political instability, fear of German infl uence, and the protection of nancial interests prompted the U.S. to invade Haiti in 1915 and then govern for nineteen years until 1934 . While some of Haiti's infrastructure grew dur- ing the occupation period, modern political life was stifl ed. After the U.S. left, leadership was character-ized by a pattern of dictatorships, coups, and failed governments, notably those of the Duvaliers, Fran\u00e7ois \"Papa Doc,\" and Jean-Claude \"Baby Doc,\" who ruled from 1957 to 1986. Their rule was inimical to the growth of accountable public institutions and a robust civil society. Transitional military rule briefl y gave way to the election of Jean-Bertrand Aristide, a left-ist priest who generated the enthusiasm and hopes of Haiti's poor. His short-lived presidency ended with a military coup d'\u00e9tat which was reversed in 1994 when President Bill Clinton threatened a U.S. inva-sion. Aristide was returned to power and when his term ended in 1996, his former prime minister, Ren\u00e9 Pr\u00e9val, was elected president. It was the rst peaceful, democratic transition of leadership in Haiti's history. Pr\u00e9val served his term, and in 2000 Aristide was again elected president. A rebellion in 2004 led to his departure\u2014according to several sources he resigned; his account was that he was essentially kidnapped by U.S. authorities and spirited off to exile in Africa. The head of the Supreme Court, Boniface Alexandre, lawfully took power as acting president, backed up by U.N. troops which still remain. In 2006, Pr\u00e9val was again elected president.Haiti, with a population of just under ten million, is one of the world's poorest. Per capita income is about $ 700 per year, with more than seventy percent of the population below the poverty line before the earthquake. The government has depended upon foreign aid. Remittances from the Haitian emigrant population of about two million living in the Dominican Republic, the U.S., Canada, France, and The Bahamas account for well over fty percent of the economy. Adult literacy is about sixty percent, and most university educated Haitians live outside the country. About two-thirds of Haitians live in rural areas, and most lack running water, access to health care and other amenities, and have largely deforested the environment in search of rewood. HAITI'S MATERIAL CULTURE For what Haiti has lacked in political stability, mate- rial wealth, industry, technological infrastructure, and other attainments, it makes up in a erce, determined, almost anarchistic dedication to the ideas of freedom and independence, and an uncanny, exuberant dedica-tion to artistic creativity. The history of Haiti's Taino people and colonial settlement is told in archaeological artifacts found in Haitian museums. The history of Haiti's struggles against slavery and for freedom is written in rare nineteenth century volumes found in Haiti's public and private libraries and evidenced by historical docu-ments found in its archives. Depictions of those strug-gles as well as idealized, romanticized, and symbolic renditions of Haitian life are found in the paintings of its art galleries. Expressions and representations of forbidden African cultural traditions are represented in metal sculptures and artwork in museums and gal-leries. Perspectives on national identity, politics, social life, and events of the day, expressed in meetings and assemblies, musical performances, plays, literary read-ings, and folk theater are found on old photographs and newer sound tapes, lm, and videotapes found in numerous private collections. Simply, these source materials document Haitian identity, providing a record of struggle and victory, perseverance and persistence in the face of ve centu- ries of crisis, travail, and turmoil. They inform Haiti's living culture, its values, attitudes, and sensibilities. With the earthquake, all of these sources of history and expression were endangered. Their loss would be a terrible blow to international scholarship, literature, and the arts, but even more so, Haitians would be cut off from and deprived of a source of strength which has, in spite of their differences, sustained them all. As Axelle Liautaud of the Centre d'Art expressed it, \"The reason why there is still a country, despite all our troubles, is our strong culture.\" 30 HAITIANS TO THE RESCUE NOT FOR SALE OR REPRODUCTIONRESPONDING TO THE EMERGENCY, PLANNING FOR RECOVERY PATRICK DELATOUR My post-earthquake charge from the president was both simple and immensely complicated: restore the institutions of government, assess the damage, manage the homeless, and develop the rst tools for national reconstruction. Just weeks before, at Christmas-time, we relished the fact that Haiti was nally on the upswing with political stabil- ity, strong economic growth, and a surging tourism sector. Now, after the earthquake, the government was counting and burying hundreds of thousands of dead and guring out how to rescue the survivors of this unprecedented disaster. As strong as the world's outpouring of support was, it was not prepared for the scale of the disaster or the needs it spawned. There was no organizational capability for quickly resurrecting an infrastructure, there was no ready stock of tents and temporary shelters, nor the capacity to produce them quickly, and there was no suf cient readily available funding to re-start the economy and move the recovery effort along. We set up our emergency commission of senior govern- ment officials and private sector leaders in temporary quarters, our team deeply affected by the devastation\u2014both personal and institutional. One group had to assess the physical damage to buildings and infrastructure and plan for the excavation, demolition, and removal of rubble. A second group had to plan and make arrangements for temporary shelters to house the displaced population. A third worked on the longer term planning for rebuilding and reconstructing the city and its surrounding region. We worked quickly and professionally, acquiring and ana- lyzing data, constructing maps, and exploring alternatives in what sometimes appeared to be an impossible task. But in just three months we were able to develop a re-alistic, viable, and detailed plan for Haiti's recovery and reconstruction\u2014a plan that earned praise from the world's donor nations, the U.N., the World Bank, and private sector industries, and a commitment of the resources to make it a reality.

At first I thought it was nothing; it was not much later that I would realize the gravity of the situation. Complete chaos in Haiti. Thousands dead, massive destruction. Soon after I learnt that the Nader Museum, founded by my father in 1992 to promote Haitian art, was destroyed. When I went there the next day, I thought all had been lost. 20,000 paintings, forming the largest private collec-tion of Haitian art, were all under the rubble. Weeks after the catastrophe, when I had the time and energy to assess the magnitude of the loss, I decided to attempt to salvage as many pieces as I could, even if dam-aged. After all, our national heritage, pieces of Haitian art that gave the people the sense of community and of being one, was at stake. The rst step in saving the collection was to retrieve all the paintings from the rubble. This was to take six months to accomplish and we were eventually able to recover about 16,000 paintings of which 3,000 were damaged. I realized that the most important paintings and sculptures were the most severely damaged, as they were not in storage but were rather displayed on the walls. To save them would take skill and materials not found in Haiti.

Others unfortunately were seriously damaged or completely destroyed. Among these were several private residences of historians and researchers. These residences were home to invaluable libraries and private collections. Assuring their safety and security was extremely urgent given the devastation and the imminent threat of bad weather in the weeks following the earthquake. I have been involved for many years in the cultural field, and in my capacity as President of the Foundation for Iconographic Research and Documentation, I immediately launched a large operation to rescue an entire segment of our heritage in danger of disappearing. Our basic goal was to provide security and shelter for these special collections. The initial phase of this operation would not have been possible without the full support and nancial assistance of the Haitian foundation, FOKAL, and some in-kind help from UNESCO. We mobilized members of our foundation, the staff of these various private collections, the Gataphy Group, which has experience in the demolition and excavation of buildings, and many volunteers. We had to buy all the equipment needed for the work\u2014and it was no easy task as most shops and specialty stores had collapsed. We also had to secure each of the sites at risk. We concentrated on the following collections and sites: \u0081 The collection of Georges Corvington, considered \"the historian of Port-au-Prince,\" on Cheriez Street, uptown, in the upper town of Port-au-Prince, known as Bois-Patate; \u0081 The collection of the heirs of Dr. Andr\u00e9 Constant, who was one of the writers of the Capois school of thought, at Saint Cyr, near the Champ de Mars; \u0081 The collection of Roger Gaillard, who was a writer and historian specializing in the history of Haiti from the nineteenth century and the period of occupation of Haiti by the United States from 1915 to 1934, at the rue Camille Leon, in the upper town area known as Bois-Verna; \u0081 The collection of the heirs of Enock Trouillot, a well known writer and ethnologist who was for many years the curator of the National Archives in Haiti, in the Morne Lazarre area near P\u00e9tion Ville; \u0081 The art collection of the Museum of Haitian Art, College of St. Pierre, property of the Episcopal Church, at the corner of Capois and Legitimate streets. Here our teams helped assemble and safeguard the scattered pieces of art work so they could eventually be restored with the help of quali ed experts. We also provided material aid to the Library of the Congregation of the Holy Spirit which includes one of the largest historical documentary collections in the country. With these ad hoc interventions, we were able to shelter all the collections mentioned above, and keep them in the hands of their rightful owners so they could later be treated and restored. Thus, we helped assure that this precious heritage would be passed on to future generations. 33 HAITIANS TO THE RESCUE NOT FOR SALE OR REPRODUCTIONThe National Cathedral, destroyed. Photo by Kesler Pierre 34 HAITIANS TO THE RESCUE NOT FOR SALE OR REPRODUCTIONTHE NATIONAL CATHEDRAL: TRYING TO HELP SAVE WHAT WAS LEFT KESLER PIERRE On January 12, 2010 I was home in New York. I didn't hear about the earthquake that hit my hometown until late that evening. I didn't learn of the massive devastation until the next day. I have both family and friends in Haiti, and it was impossible to get information on anyone's well-being. Subsequently I learned my family members were okay, but I had lost friends. Watching the news coverage converted my initial emotional reaction to resolve. I had to get there and try to help. Commercial air travel had been suspended. I contacted relief organizations to no avail. Two weeks later I was able to take an American Airlines fl ight to the Dominican Republic, then a bus across the border into Haiti. I spent the next six weeks volunteering at the Haitian Community Hospital. As I have no medical skills, I did whatever I could do: serving as translator, trying to comfort the injured, unloading trucks, unclogging toilets. Time off from the hospital was spent attending to my personal concerns, these were, my loved ones, and the Cathedral of Our Lady of the Assumption-Haiti's National Cathedral. I was very familiar with the structure of the Cathedral; I'd been all over it\u2014in the bell towers, in the crawlspace between the ceiling and the roof, places where the public generally doesn't get to go. For the past eleven years I'd been trying to raise awareness that the stained glass was endangered and in dire need of restoration, but my efforts had been met with a mix of lukewarm interest and outright apathy from both the Church and government of cials. Construction on the Cathedral began in 1884, and its windows were fairly intricately painted. There were chancel windows designed by Frederick Cole, an artist of some note, and the Cathedral had been the site of countless ceremonies attended by Haiti's sitting presidents, other high-ranking government of cials, and members of the diplomatic corps. The stained glass wasn't just lovely, it was part of a historic building. I'd been restoring the glass of landmark buildings in the United States for decades and didn't understand why no one in Haiti thought saving the Cathedral's art glass a worthwhile endeavor. Then the quake hit, and almost miraculously much of the stained glass had been spared. The damage to the Cathedral was evident from almost any vantage point in Port-au-Prince; ordinarily you would be able to see the bell towers no matter where you were; now, there was only sky where they used to be. Looking at that absence was a little disorienting, similar to looking at the hole in the Manhattan skyline after September 11, 2001. Before entering the wrecked Cathedral for the rst time I hesitated expecting someone to stop me. No one did. I hesitated some more, recognizing the inherent physical danger of entering this severely compromised structure. I left my gear at the threshold and walked through the door. I had to climb over rubble; it was all twisted metal and hanging debris. News photos had prepared me for this. What I hadn't expected was the silence. This area had always been a cacophony of street vendors, motor vehicle traf c, and life; now it was positively peaceful. I closed my eyes shutting out the view of wreckage so at odds with the serene feel of the place, and remembered a ceremony I attended here many years ago. It was a midnight mass and all the lights in the Cathedral had been turned off. Each person in the crowd held an unlit candle and we all stood in the pitch darkness. The priest entered through the main door at the rear of the Cathedral; the same one I had just used. He held a lit candle, and when he spoke, leading us in a hymn, he shared his fl ame with the parishioners to either side, and they in turn shared their fl ames. As light spread through the Cathedral toward the altar, the vibration of our combined voices grew and I remember thinking, there really is something here\u2014something powerful. I opened my eyes on the devastation. If it was a sacred site before, it still was one now, maybe more so given all the people who died here. Something huge and powerful was still here, and standing in the quiet, looking at all the sharp, broken edges both above and below, I had the sense that I was standing in its mouth. I was sweating, which in Haiti you do a lot of - but this was a cold sweat. This ruined Cathedral could crush me at any moment. I heard a trickle of falling stones and that sent me running out the door. My heart was pounding; standing once again at the threshold I caught my breath and waited a moment. Nothing collapsed; I picked up my camera equipment, and went back in to photograph. I knew I had to do whatever I could to save what was left.

Since its creation in the mid 1940s by a group of Haitian artists and two American artists\u2014De Witt Peters and Selden Rodman\u2014it has been at the center of cultural life in Haiti. It has played an essential role in the creation of the murals at the Holy Trinity Episcopal Cathedral. It has donated the masterpieces that formed the permanent col-lection of the Museum of Haitian Art. The Centre d'Art has been an inspiration for me throughout my life, lling me with pride and with the conviction that at the heart of our culture lay invaluable treasures providing us with endless sources of inspiration. Pierre Monosiet, Luce Turnier, Albert Ma ngon\u00e8s, Lawrence Peabody, and Francine Murat were all close friends and mentors. When Francine Murat asked Antonio Joseph, Jr., and me to become members of the board I felt privileged. In December 2009 Francine, aged ninety, broke her leg and suffered a stroke. She was slowly recovering but her absence from the Centre was worrying me. I met with Maryse Desrosier to talk about the urgent need to put the board in charge. I needed to consu lt the bylaws, to know what the procedures were. Maryse sent me a copy of the bylaws on January 11, 2010.On January 12, the earthquake devastated Port-au-Prince. Immersed in my personal grief and emergencies\u2014my ninety year old fathe r suddenly homeless, my brother trapped beneath the rubble of a house for days, my cousin killed\u2014I nally got to the Centre days later.I saw the collapsed building. Some of the structure was still standing but could topple at any time. Art was scattered all over and hang- ing from the gaping top fl oor. Most of the fencing walls were down and bands of thieves were raiding the property, taking whatever they could and terrorizing the neighborhood. As a personal initiative, I put a team of construction workers to the task of building a fence around the Centre using some of the tin and wood from the collapsed roof. Construction materials were hard to nd. My driver found stores around March\u00e9 Salomon that were selling at top prices through half opened doors. No one was allowed in: you paid and got your goods on the sidewalk. A friend and I put our cash together, as the banks were closed, and we managed to buy enough tin and wood to nish the fence. We also paid a group of brave but untrained and unarmed young men to keep away the looters. I contacted Lorraine Mangon\u00e8s, member of the board and Director of FOKAL (a Haitian educational and cultural foundation). Meanwhile, some Centre d'Art employees, directed by Maryse Desrosier and Henry Celestin, had started to retrieve the artwork fr om the collapsed building, stacking everything in a container they had managed to nd. Because of the amount of rubble in the yard and the danger caused by the partly collapsed structure with constant aftershocks, the container had to be kept on the street in fr ont of the Centre. The situation had become more uncontrollable. Armed bands were attacking the Centre and trying to open the containe r. Lorraine convinced the board of FOKAL to pay a security company to provide a twenty-four-hour watch on the Centre. Retrieving the artwork was continuing at a fast pace. The danger of looters and aftershocks was real and the workers were eager to nish. The rst container was soon full. A second container was needed, but containers were in great demand. People used them for anything from storage to housing. Thei r prices were high and we had no resources. After weeks of looking I nally got one on loan from a friend. A planned meeting of the board with Francine had to be cancelled because her health condition had suddenly deteriorated. In Feb ruary, Francine Murat, who had been the head and the heart of the Centre d'Art for fty years, passed away. She was followed days later by Jacques Laroche, another board member. We also learned that the driver, who had left the Centre on January 12 in the Centre d'A rt car minutes before the earthquake, had been killed while driving; he was crushed by falling buildings. The Centre now had no director, a non-functioning board missing two members, and no access to Centre d'Art bank accounts. In or der to legally take over, the board had to replace two missing members. Invaluable and irreplaceable art, salvaged from the rubble, was now in danger of being lost, slowly cooking in the heat and humidity of the containers, while discussions about what to do dragged on.

There were many of them. CHAPTER THREE INTERNATIONAL AND AMERICAN ORGANIZATIONS MOBILIZE The devastation to Haiti and the potential loss of its rich cultural history, and the courage and vision of our partners, gave us the chance to galvanize support around this tragedy and make a concrete and lasting contribution. \u2014Margo Lion, Co-Chair, U.S. President's Committee on the Arts and the Humanities NOT FOR SALE OR REPRODUCTION[Upper] Haiti was featured on the National Mall as part of the Smithsonian Folklife Festival in 2004.

Photo courtesy Smithsonian Folklife Festival THE SMITHSONIAN'S HAITI CONNECTION In the summer of 2004, in recognition of Haiti's 200th anniversary of independence, the Smithsonian Folklife Festival had featured a living exposition of cultural traditions entitled Haiti: Creativity and Freedom from the Mountains to the Sea on the National Mall in Washington, D.C. More than 150 Haitian artists, musicians, craftspeople, story tellers, herbalists, boat builders, farmers, cooks, ritual specialists, and merchants had performed and demonstrated their traditions over a two-week period to almost a million visitors. I'd been the Director of the Smithsonian's Center for Folklife and Cultural Heritage that produces the Festival and had been intimately involved in developing the Haiti program along with my colleagues, Festival Director Diana Parker and Curator Diana N'Diaye. We'd worked closely with a leadership group in Haiti. Leslie Voltaire had been President Aristide's Minister of Haitians Abroad who'd rst brought the idea of featuring Haiti at the Festival to me and laid the governmental groundwork for its production. A triumvirate of co-curators\u2014Geri Benoit, Patrick Delatour, and Patrick Vilaire, later to be designated Commissioners by the Haitian government, were our key partners. Geri Benoit, a foreign affairs specialist and former wife of Ren\u00e9 Pr\u00e9val, involved in a woman's crafts and development cooperative, was the lead organizer. Patrick Delatour, a histori-cal architect who'd years before been a Smithsonian fellow and who'd help restore the Citadel, shaped key themes and design elements. Patrick Vilaire, an artist, grass roots orga-nizer, cultural thinker, and community developer provided the inspiration for developing the presentations. In partnership with the Smithsonian, they'd organized dozens of scholars to carry out eld research in Haiti, conduct scores of interviews, document living cultural traditions, and ultimately identify and arrange for selected Haitians to travel to Washington for the Festival. Others in Haiti, like Gisele Fleurant, the head of a large crafts cooperative, were enlisted to round up items for sale at the Festival. Georges Nader was enlisted to mount a temporary art gallery in the Festival's Marketplace, adjacent to the Smithsonian Castle and the Freer Gallery of Art. A Haitian student nishing his graduate training at Columbia University, Olsen Jean Julien, was hired to coordinate the program, attending to all the logistics involved. It was a massive effort over the course of two years, and particularly challenging as the Aristide government was dissolved, replaced by a new \"interim\" presi-dent and a new administration only months before opening. President Boniface Alexander gave the keynote speech to open the Festival on the National Mall. I asked Senator Christopher Dodd, a Regent of the Smithsonian who knew Haiti from his Peace Corps days in the Dominican Republic, to present Geri Benoit, Patrick Delatour, and Patrick Vilaire special certi cates at the opening ceremony. It made them Smithsonian Research Associates, and I hoped that status might be helpful in protect-ing them from possible political intrigue and repercussions once they returned to Haiti. The Haitian artists, musicians and others charmed and educated visitors over the course of the ten days of the Festival, appeared on the Today Show , and reveled in the positive attention they received\u2014especially given the instability back home. The Festival took place coincidently with a World Bank sponsored donors' conference on Haiti. Haiti's Prime Minister Gerard Latortue, in a Washington Post op-ed, pointed to the Festival pro- gram as illustrating the creativity and industry of the Haitian people, who, if given the opportunity, could do wonderful things back in their own country. Donors committed $1.2 billion to Haiti, about $250 million more than initially expected. Producing the Festival program had good results and spawned all sorts of positive impacts in Haiti. It also cemented ties between and among those involved\u2014we'd worked hard through challenging times and had developed a strong trust in each other.Our hearts went out to the people of Haiti. -G. Wayne Clough, Secretary, Smithsonian Institution 39 INTERNATIONAL AND AMERICAN ORGANIZATIONS MOBILIZE NOT FOR SALE OR REPRODUCTIONPatrick Vilaire, a sculptor, community developer, and curator sought to protect endangered rare book collections, like that of Georges Corvington. New York Times reporter Marc Lacey asked him about saving old books in light of the catastrophe, \"The dead are dead, we know that. But if you don't have the memory of the past, the rest of us can't continue living,\" Patrick responded.\"Oh my goodness!\u2014The Haitians can't catch a break!\"\u2014That was my response as the CNN Breaking News alert fl ashed on my computer screen. However, in less than twenty-four hours, I found myself making cold calls and sending e-mails all across the country and the world. You see, I work for a person who is all about action. \"We can't save lives, provide shelter or food, but we have the expertise to help the Haitians save their cultural heritage,\" Richard Kurin declared. And, after that comment, we went to work. There was no script. You did what needed to be done. \u2014LeShawn Burrell-Jones, Special Assistant to the Under Secretary, Smithsonian Institution Several dozen Haitian cooperatives, crafts and artisanal organizations, galleries and businesses participated in the Festival Marketplace in 2004. Photo by Jeff Tinsley/Smithsonian 40 INTERNATIONAL AND AMERICAN ORGANIZATIONS MOBILIZE NOT FOR SALE OR REPRODUCTIONNOW, SIX YEARS LATER Now, some six years later, I was e-mailing and on the telephone. I asked Diana N'Diaye to see what she could do to track down our friends and nd out about each and every Haitian who participated in the 2004 Festival program. I reached Geri rst, and fairly easily. She was now Haiti's Ambassador to Italy. She too was desperately try-ing to get information about her family back home. Communications were impossible. I knew Patrick Delatour was Minister of T ourism, but couldn't reach him. Olsen had just recently stepped down as Minister of Culture and Communication, and no one I knew had heard from him either. I scoured news reports to see if I could nd any clues as to their safety and the safety of others. I had a few intense discussions with Wayne Clough, the Secretary of the Smithsonian. Wayne is a trained engineer and geologist who specialized in earthquakes. He immediately understood full well the disaster in Haiti, its human and physical toll. I told him of the Smithsonian's history with Haiti and our direct ties to a number of key leaders there. We both knew there was not much the Smithsonian could do with regard to the rescue of human life, or in providing food or health care or other such basic survival services. But we thought we might be able to help in areas of our expertise\u2014providing some type of support to cultural and educational organizations. I told Wayne that I was disappointed in the Smithsonian in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. Many organizations in New Orleans and the Gulf region sought help as the flooding damaged and threatened important collections and archives. The Smithsonian posted information on its website and participated in emergency calls with a network of national and regional cultural organizations, but we'd done precious little when it came to on-the-ground action. In spite of larger institutional inac-tion, the Center for Folklife and Cultural Heritage had joined with colleague Lonnie Bunch, Director of the National Museum of African American History and Culture, to bring New Orleans musicians to the Festival. We sold their CDs, promoted Gulf region recordings on our Smithsonian Folkways label, tried to help artists get work and stimulate cultural activ-ity, while also keeping disaster recovery in public view. (I only recently learned that the Smithsonian's Materials Conservation Institute worked closely with the Southern University of New Orleans to help them save their African art collection.) Wayne had worked in New Orleans, part of a sci- enti c task force studying the impact of Katrina and trying to help prevent such a catastrophe in the future. I told him the Smithsonian might be able to help in Haiti, and he said \"go for it.\" We were then uncertain about just exactly what that might mean. Through the recently appointed State Department liaison to the Smithsonian Larry Wohlers, I alerted of - cials in the Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs of our high-level contacts in Haiti and the Institution's willingness to help with cultural relief and recovery matters. We both thought cooperation with UNESCO as the lead international intergovernmental cultural agency made sense, and sought clarity through our dip-lomatic mission in Paris on how they were proceeding. We started to gather information on cultural sites, col-lections, and people in order to assess the damages. News started to come in from Haiti. It was gut-wrenching. Patrick Delatour was alive. He had been appointed by President Pr\u00e9val to head the commission deal-ing with the emergency and reconstruction. This was an enormous job, made all the more onerous because Patrick's parents had died in the earthquake. Their house had collapsed upon them. I had been in that house. Patrick's parents had an art gallery within. Back in 2004 they'd given me a painting to donate to the Smithsonian. It hangs in the conference room of the Center for Folklife and Cultural Heritage. With pre-cious little time to grieve, Patrick had the weight of his beloved country on his shoulders. I heard from Geri that Leslie Voltaire was work- ing with Patrick. Leslie, an architect and urban planner, would become Haiti's liaison with the United Nations and with the Clinton Foundation in dealing with the response to the earthquake. Diana N'Diaye and I heard from Olsen through one of his relatives. It had taken him days to get a mes-sage out. It was welcome, but jarring, \" Je suis en vie ,\" \"I am alive.\" We still hadn't reached Patrick Vilaire until on January 23 a front page story in the New York Times reported on his activities. He had a brilliant quote and it was so typical of Patrick to be focused on saving Haiti's heritage in the midst of the chaotic and dif cult situation around him. Slowly news of others started coming in. Several artists and musicians had perished. Others had survived, though most were in dif cult straits. Coverage of the Nader Museum's total devastation hit hard. It contin-ued to be dif cult to get information about Jacmel, a center of Haiti's crafts production. I wanted to travel to Haiti to do nothing more than express solidarity with these good professional friends, and of course, try to gure out the best ways to help them. But I knew that would have to wait until they were ready\u2014the priority was clearly to rescue survivors, get the injured under care, and the dead bur-ied. Then we'd look at a plan of action for culture. 41 INTERNATIONAL AND AMERICAN ORGANIZATIONS MOBILIZE NOT FOR SALE OR REPRODUCTIONTHE SMITHSONIAN CONSIDERS HOW TO HELP L. H. (HUGH) SHOCKEY, JR. On January 29 and again on February 4, I joined other Smithsonian colleagues for meetings called by Richard Kurin to discuss how the Smithsonian might help Haiti culturally in light of the devastating effects of the earth- quake. The central discussion of both meetings focused on how could the Smithsonian help Haiti utilizing Institutional resources, and what could we offer if we were able to part-ner with other organizations. With these meetings the Smithsonian plotted how for the rst time in its history it could become involved in cultural recovery outside of the United States. The central idea was that we should take a supporting role in facilitating Haitian efforts to recover their own heritage. This was important given our respect for our Haitian cul- tural colleagues as well as our practical concern that any initiative be sustainable long after the Smithsonian ended its involvement. We discussed the possibility of physically aiding the damaged collections in Haiti, necessarily involving Haitians as part of the process. I spoke up about my own past experiences with disaster recovery and explained that the process can involve inexperienced individuals directed by specialists. While the specifics of what we would be doing to help in Haiti remained to be de ned, these initial meetings helped narrow the focus of how to approach the recovery effort and helped sketch an idea that could be proposed to Haitians and other agencies to gain support.

BELL Among the important tasks of the American Association of Museums (AAM), as the United States' leading mu- seum service organization, is our work to develop a co-hesive and responsive community among museums\u2014and not only among U.S. museums, but including those in all countries around the globe. Art, culture, history, science, nature, living collections, childhood, and lifelong learning: all of these are things that museums dedicate themselves to every day, but none begins or ends at anyone's border. Knowledge belongs to all of us, just as it comes from all of us. It is a part of the museum mission to ensure that this knowledge\u2014our shared heritage, evidence of human achievement, and the glories of the natural world\u2014is avail-able to all. This is the essence of a museum, just as it is the essence of community. Like so many tragedies, even those on a grand scale, there was an opportunity hidden somewhere in the Haiti disaster. A country, a distinct and proud culture, suffered a devas-tating blow. All of us are impacted because that country and culture are part of our global heritage, a part of what museums celebrate and share. All of us, therefore, have an obligation to respond. In the museum community, the Haiti earthquake, just like Hurricane Katrina ve years before, reminded us vividly of how dependent we are upon one another, institutions and individuals, and what we can ac-complish when we respond together, as a true community. This is why we at AAM welcomed the chance to host a key meeting on February 5 at our headquarters in Washington, D.C., led by the U.S. Committee of the Blue Shield; that meeting gave rise to the relief effort organized and led by the Smithsonian Institution. It seemed a small step at the time, but it resulted in something much larger, thanks to the efforts of Richard Kurin, and a whole community of colleagues. Museums, at their best, educate, inspire, and preserve. This is our mission. It never ends at a single border. In Haiti, a cohesive and caring global community of museums contin-ues the effort of recovery. We are proud to be a part of it. Ford W. Bell is President of the American Association of Museums, Washington, D.C. 42 INTERNATIONAL AND AMERICAN ORGANIZATIONS MOBILIZE NOT FOR SALE OR REPRODUCTIONRESPONDING TO CULTURAL DISASTER The way I started to think and talk about Haiti's cul- tural disaster, was to draw parallels between Port-au- Prince and Washington. If we had a terrible disaster in Washington in which the White House, the Capitol, the National Archives, the Library of Congress, the Smithsonian, and all the museums had collapsed, we'd surely rescue people rst, and then we'd deal with the deceased. At some point after that we'd think about going into the rubble and pulling out the Declaration of Independence, the Star-Spangled Banner, the trea-sures in the National Gallery of Art, the rare books, and so on. These are the foundational items that speak to who we are as Americans. Similarly, Haitians have their treasures, their icons, the objects that express and represent the Haitian experience. People do not shed these things lightly. I convened meetings of Smithsonian colleagues to explore what we might do. Initially I focused my thinking more on the mid-term. We could, as we'd done after Katrina, invite Haitian artists and musi-cians to the Folklife Festival, buy and promote the sale of Haitian crafts so as to get some money into their hands and allow folks to revive their cultural busi-nesses. I called Lonnie Bunch who immediately com-mitted funds to help. Other suggestions were made. One staff mem- ber noted that Haitian scientists were probably deprived of their research facilities and possibly even their homes\u2014maybe they and their families could be housed at the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute in Panama, where they could continue their work. Another staffer, Hugh Shockey, an Objects Conservator from the Smithsonian American Art Museum, spoke of his experience in rescuing objects from disaster sites. If you didn't do this type of work relatively quickly, you had less to work with later on, he argued. He also emphasized training Haitians to do recovery and basic conservation work. Johnnetta Cole, the Director of the National Museum of African Art, an anthropologist who'd worked in the Caribbean, and gone on to the presidency of Spelman College, elaborated on this most emphatically. Haitians had to be involved and fully engaged from the get-go, and training and skills development had to be built into any project as a core element\u2014and we all agreed. Hugh's suggestion that the Smithsonian might play a more immediate, direct role in a cultural response struck a chord. Hugh had the training and experience for such work\u2014I didn't know how many others or who at the Smithsonian might be similarly quali ed. Nor did I know who else to enlist in such an effort if we went in that direction. At a fateful meeting on February 5 , I found out. Ford Bell, the Executive Director of the American Association of Museums, was hosting a meeting called by Corine Wegener, the President of the U.S. Committee of the Blue Shield. It included representa-tives from various U.S. government agencies and orga-nizations and from professional associations concerned with cultural heritage. Participants at rst shared what was known about the situation in Haiti. Information was slowly coming in. Daniel Elie's ISPAN Bulletin was eye-opening, with graphic images of all sorts of buildings\u2014the National Palace, the National Cathedral, churches, and so on all destroyed. How the Haitians were organized was completely unknown\u2014the Caribbean Archives Association had put out an emergency call for a detailed list of conservation sup-plies, but how they would be delivered, deployed, and used was unclear. We went around the table, talking about authori- ties and responsibilities, what different organizations might and might not be able to do. I was impressed by Cori's experience and perspective\u2014we'd never met, but I knew of her good work as a U.S. Army Civil Affairs Officer in stabilizing the situation at the Iraqi National Museum following the infamous looting in the wake of the U.S. invasion. Eryl Wentworth, the Executive Director of the American Institute for Conservation of Historic and Artistic Works (AIC), was well-respected by all, and had her hand on a cadre of experts trained in the rescue of collections in disaster situations. What was apparent was that no organization had any connections to Haitian cultural leaders. Those connections would be needed if we were to get per-mission and have support to launch a cultural rescue mission on Haitian soil. Also apparent was that no one had such a duty as an institutional responsibil-ity. The U.S. government agencies had no charge or funding for such a task. The NGOs would undertake such work voluntarily, but needed someone to fund the effort, clear the way diplomatically, and provide an organizational infrastructure. Snow was in the air. I imagined all those col- lections in Haiti in the rubble, exposed to the ele-ments, just getting rained on, blown around, and wasting away. Five hundred years of history and cul- tural expression documenting an amazing story of the struggle for freedom being lost\u2014just because we couldn't figure out a way to help. T o me it was the Iraqi Museum and Katrina debacles all over again, as we helplessly watched from the sidelines. Since there was no plan and I was the last to speak, I said we needed one. I noted our high-level contacts in Haiti and the Smithsonian's desire to help, and was determined to see something through. I also saw that with folks like Cori and Eryl various ele-ments of a plan could come together. 43 INTERNATIONAL AND AMERICAN ORGANIZATIONS MOBILIZE NOT FOR SALE OR REPRODUCTIONThough I had never been to Haiti, news of the earthquake lled me rst with horror.THE BLUE SHIELD: FROM HORROR TO RESPONSE CORINE WEGENER Though I had never been to Haiti, news of the earthquake lled me rst with horror, then with anxiety. As President of the U.S. Committee of the Blue Shield, the U.S. branch of an interna- tional non-governmental organization (NGO) dedicated to the protection of cultural property during man-made and natural disasters, I knew it would fall to our relatively new organization to try and coordinate a U.S. response for cultural heritage. Our main concern thus far had been training U.S. military units about the importance of cultural heritage protection during armed confl icts. We had never before sought to rescue or safeguard a whole country's cultural heritage, especially on the scale that might be needed in Haiti. In the days after the earthquake we began working with colleagues in the International Blue Shield network to gather information on damage to museums, libraries, and other cultural sites. We quickly circulated a \"Haiti Watch List\" via e-mail. While it was all good information, I knew the next steps had to be on the ground and for that we had to rally our U.S. partners. With the American Association of Museums providing a venue, I invited representatives from U.S. government agencies and cultural heritage NGOs to meet in Washington, D.C., on February 5. The purpose of the meeting was to share information about disaster response for cultural heritage in Haiti. Going around the room it quickly became apparent that no such plans were underway, either from the U.S. or internationally. Many of us present were not surprised, having been witness to the lack of an emergency response for cultural heritage after the looting of the Iraq Museum, Hurricane Katrina, and subsequent disasters. Even after those experiences, the cultural heri-tage community had yet to develop an effective international organization to provide an emergency response akin to other types of humanitarian assistance. The International Blue Shield was good at collecting information and providing expertise, but we all knew it did not have the infrastructure to send a team to Haiti. The American Institute for Conservation had developed the Collections Emergency Response Teams (AIC-CERT) as a response to Hurricane Katrina, but their funding was for domestic disasters. It seemed that we had a lot of organiza- tions that wanted to help, but no plan and no money. We were at a standstill. Among those I had invited to the discussion was Richard Kurin, Under Secretary for History, Art, and Culture at the Smithsonian Institution. Richard informed us that he was in communication with Haitian colleagues and indicated the Smithsonian's willingness to help. He expressed his surprise and frustration at the lack of action, not just for Haiti, but for emergency response for culture in general. Richard pledged to see what he could do. I was, as they say, \"cautiously optimistic.\" So imagine my surprise when Richard called me a couple of weeks later and said, \"I'm going to Haiti next week\u2014do you want to come?\" It was the beginning of a wonderful partnership that crystallized into the Haiti Cultural Recovery Project. Corine Wegener is President of the U.S. Committee of the Blue Shield and a Curator at the Minneapolis Institute of Arts. She served in the U.S. Army as a Civil Affairs Of cer and aided in the recovery efforts at the Iraq National Museum in Baghdad. 44 INTERNATIONAL AND AMERICAN ORGANIZATIONS MOBILIZE NOT FOR SALE OR REPRODUCTIONMOBILIZING THE CONSERVATION COMMUNITY ERYL P. WENTWORTH AND ERIC POURCHOT With yet another blizzard forecast for Washington, D.C., that afternoon, we joined a group of government and NGO representatives in the conference room of the American Association of Museums on February 5 to discuss how the U.S. might assist in Haiti. Corine Wegener of the U.S. Committee of the Blue Shield indicated that we were already late in mounting a response. The desire to help was evident; the capacity to help was not. The Foundation of the American Institute for Conservation (FAIC) had volunteers and a domestic response system in place, but no funding, no contacts in Haiti, and no experience with international assistance. We pointed out that artistic and cultural works would not magically show up for conservation; the collect-ing organizations and individuals would have to request assistance. As we dashed for home in the snow, there seemed to be little hope that we could play a mean- ingful role in Haiti. However, on February 10, before the roads in D.C. were clear again, we were buoyed by the Smithsonian Institution's offer to support a response team. FAIC responded immediately by putting out a call for volunteers to the AIC Collections Emergency Response Team (AIC-CERT). We began wrestling with questions of housing\u2014(would we stay in tents?), medical insurance, inoculations and medications, liability issues, and how to provide meaningful assistance with-out equipment and a place to work. We knew we could help, but there were still a lot of questions about how. Eryl P.

Shockey, Jr./Smithsonian 45 INTERNATIONAL AND AMERICAN ORGANIZATIONS MOBILIZE NOT FOR SALE OR REPRODUCTIONI came back from that meeting and spoke to Larry Wohlers and John Dickson, head of Western Hemisphere Affairs for the State Department's public affairs operation who was traveling to Haiti. I needed him to enlist the help of the U.S. Embassy and U.S. agencies in Haiti. While at one point I had thought about rescued Haitian collections coming to the U.S. for safe storage and treatment, I realized that such would run entirely counter to Haitian sensibilities and even provoke suspicions about U.S. interests. Instead, I envisioned the establishment of a cultural recovery base in Haiti, seeing it as an encampment of tents, generators, secure fencing, portable toilets, vehicles, and equipment\u2014much as we produce for the Smithsonian Folklife Festival. I asked Smithsonian staff to start coming up with budgets. One technical advisor came up with a budget of about $ 20 million for the infrastructure and personnel funds for such an operation. I thought this was a highly infl ated and totally unrealistic amount. It put most of the resources into the hands of relief providers. I was convinced we could develop a viable project for a much more modest amount, and also place most of the responsibilities and resources into Haitian hands. A few days later, I e-mailed Cori and asked for her help, \"We are looking at the following as an emerg-ing plan\u2014though it is just that, as a lot would have to fall into place particularly with State, U.S. AID, and DoD. But since nothing is moving now, we need to step up and see if we can make something work.\" I outlined the elements: \u0081 State Department would help secure Haitian gov- ernment permission for a U.S. cultural recovery effort through discussions with Patrick Delatour. \u0081 Smithsonian would work with State, U.S. AID, and Department of Defense to secure a designated location, tents, sea containers, a few vehicles, and equipment in order to establish a modest cultural base in Haiti. \u0081 Smithsonian would use its own resources and seek funding and support for operations from the U.S. government, NGOs, and private donors. \u0081 Smithsonian would employ Patrick Vilaire and MOURN AND MOBILIZE GERI BENOIT How does one mourn and create a new life at the same time? That was the question in my mind when my friend Richard Kurin and I met in Rome, in February, one month after the earthquake that would change the lives of those who survived it, profoundly and forever. In this time of sorrow and despair, there was also the opportu- nity for introspection and refl ection about how to better create and coordinate development programs with Haiti that really could make a positive difference in people's lives. However, what I need-ed at the moment was courage and once again my Smithsonian family provided that. Richard brought friendship and compassion that would quickly transform into action. Our thoughts were mainly about living cultural heritage. Haitians use their arts for survival. They are incredibly creative. How to encourage Haitian artistry and craftsmanship whether in music, art, food, or fashion\u2014so that living artists could bene t from a world more attuned to and supportive of their creative produce? We needed to gure out ways artists could nd support around the world. And the world, by buying Haitian, would support the recovery and rebirth of the Haitian people and their economy. So in the wake of snow fl urries which had not been seen for twen- ty- four years, and always considered as a miracle by Romans, we went to the of ce of Gianni Alemano, Mayor of Rome, to present a plan for how European cities could help Haiti build back a better life by supporting and encouraging festivals, performances, exhi-bitions, and marketing programs featuring Haitian artists and its living cultural heritage\u2014a concept dear to Italians. Mobilizing all sorts of organizations and forces in this direction was key. Since in addition to leading the Embassy of Haiti in Italy I was also Permanent Representative of Haiti to the United Nations Agencies in Rome, I sought additional partners. Information-sharing gatherings quickly became support meetings. People wanted to grieve with us and be involved in our discussions and projects to get Haiti back on its feet. So using our cuisine, art, music, lm, several gatherings were organized\u2014in Los Angeles with Deepak Chopra, in Warsaw with former First Lady Maria Kaczynska, and in Rome with the great soccer goal keeper Dino Zoff.

At some point though, cultural relief would also be needed. Staff of the International Centre for the Study of the Preservation and Restoration of Cultural Property (ICCROM) set up a group of volunteers, and launched the Helping Heritage in Haiti (HHH) effort which I decided to chair. How could ICCROM, an organization devoted to the conservation of cultural heritage, respond and assist Haiti in the face of this natural disaster? Coordination with various international organizations made sense in order to avoid any overlapping and duplication of efforts. An international meeting called by UNESCO's Director-General, Irina Bokova, for mid-February in Paris and involving Haiti's cultural officials would provide an opportunity to organize a coordinated response to address needs in the cultural heritage eld. During this post-earthquake period I was in contact with my friend Richard Kurin, Under Secretary at the Smithsonian. He was making a short trip to Rome prior to the UNESCO meeting, and mentioned the possibility of joining forces with ICCROM to help save Haitian cultural collections, and train Haitians in conservation work, a prospect I welcomed very warmly. Our common approach was then discussed days later during a working lunch with Geri Benoit, Ambassador of Haiti to Italy who expressed her support and promised to convey her endorsement to Haitian of cials, including the Minister of Culture attending the UNESCO conference the next day. Richard and I both reinforced the approach to work under the guidance of the Haitian authorities for \"the preservation and res-toration of movable cultural property and train Haitians in this work\" at the UNESCO meeting. The representative of the U.S. del-egation to UNESCO supported this statement and underlined the need to set priorities for necessary action. It was the term \"action\" that stuck in my mind when returning to Rome, and brie ng my HHH group of colleagues. I thus started to de ne with the ICCROM HHH group a method for urgent action in planning a training course in a time-frame which is not the one usually followed for regular courses. It had to be a \"crash-course,\" mainly to be held in the eld rather than in a classroom. It had to closely associate Smithsonian experts and those who have experience in post-disaster recovery. In only three months, a full training program was set up and an agreement was signed in June 2010 with our partner, the Smithsonian Institution. Mounir Bouchenaki is the Director-General of ICCROM. An archaeolo- gist, he was formerly Assistant Director-General for Culture for UNESCO. Olsen Jean Julien to identify and prioritize cultural sites and collections of art work, artifacts, photo-graphs, recordings, and other media to rescue and recover. \u0081 Materials from sites would be taken to the cultural base for triage, processing, and secure storage. \u0081 Smithsonian would work closely with other U.S. cultural agencies, UNESCO, ICOMOS, ICOM, et al., and NGOs like Blue Shield, and AIC to bring to Haiti experienced team leaders in the recovery of endangered collections. They would bring in the needed supplies and equipment. They would work closely with and train Haitians in immediate rescue work. Given that U.S. AID had quickly established a \"work for cash program,\" this might be a way of funding Haitian labor on the project. \u0081 Over the long term, Smithsonian and other part-ners would cooperate with the Haitian govern-ment in the training of Haitian conservators, col-lections managers, and other experts. The next week, UNESCO's Director-General Irina Bokova was convening an international meet- ing in Paris to discuss what the world's cultural orga-nizations might do in helping Haiti. With the support of the State Department and the U.S. Mission to UNESCO, I'd been invited. I flew to Rome a day before the UNESCO meeting to see Geri Benoit and Mounir Bouchenaki. Mounir had been the Assistant Director-General for Culture at UNESCO, and was now the Director-General of ICCROM, the International Centre for the Study of the Preservation and Restoration of Cultural Property. Mounir and I had worked together on a number of projects over the years, and he was a member of the Folklife Advisory Council at the Smithsonian. Since ICCROM special-ized in the preservation of cultural collections and was a world-wide leader in training, I thought we had a natural t for collaboration in a Haiti cultural recov-ery project. Geri and I discussed how we could work together on supporting Haiti's artists and living cultural activities. At lunch, Geri, Mounir, and I discussed a full range of project possibilities, and strategized about the UNESCO meeting. 47 INTERNATIONAL AND AMERICAN ORGANIZATIONS MOBILIZE NOT FOR SALE OR REPRODUCTIONHAITI\u2014MAKING CULTURE A MOTOR FOR RECONSTRUCTION FRANCESCO BANDARIN Cultural life, in all its facets, plays a central role in Haitian life. When the sector was hit hard by the 2010 earthquake, UNESCO responded quickly, working with the authorities and local communities to revitalize cultural activity. The Haitian authorities af rmed the importance of culture by recognizing it as a key component of the social pillar of the Action Plan for National Recovery and Development for Haiti, and the Organization worked closely with them to under-take emergency actions during the rst weeks, and months following the disaster. Emergency efforts to prevent further damage ranged from preventing illicit traf cking of art and the protection of heritage sites from looting and collapse, to salvaging library, archival, and museum objects. UNESCO also helped artisans to restart their businesses, which constitute a vibrant cultural and economic sector in Haiti. These early interventions stabilized the situa-tion and prevented further signi cant damages and losses. They also have laid the foundation for the long-term recovery of the culture sector. Haiti's cultural wealth also provided much-needed psycho-social relief to the large numbers of communities affected by the disaster. By creating mobile libraries in camps for displaced communities, supporting theatre performances, and organizing creative workshops for children and youth, the culture sector contributed signi cantly to improving the every day reality for many Haitians. Responding to the national authorities' call for increasing coordination among the many actors ready to support the recovery of the culture sector in Haiti, an International Coordination Committee for the Safeguarding of the Haitian Cultural Heritage (ICC) was established. At its rst plenary session in July 2010, the ICC adopted recommendations that provided a roadmap for programs for action that have since been elaborated with a number of national and international partners into a strategy for medium- and long-term recovery. UNESCO convened a large conference in April 2011 as a stepping stone towards mobilizing resources for the implementation of the programs for action. UNESCO is now starting these longer-term recovery efforts, aiming to assist Haiti in rebuilding a free and vibrant society for all\u2014by improving the material and social conditions for artists, creators, institutions, and communities by protecting and reinvigorating heritage spaces; by coordinating and raising awareness of valuable cultural resources; by building up sustainable infrastructures; and by fostering creativity through education. A widespread movement of solidarity was born the day after the 2010 earthquake in Haiti. We should maintain this momentum through sustainable partnerships and lasting commitments for the country to undertake the long and challenging task of reconstruction. Francesco Bandarin is the Assistant Director-General for Culture of UNESCO Haiti's cultural wealth also provided much-needed psycho-social relief to the large numbers of communities affected by the disaster. INTERNATIONAL AND AMERICAN ORGANIZATIONS MOBILIZE 48 NOT FOR SALE OR REPRODUCTIONThe next day, in Paris, the UNESCO meeting was chaired by Irina Bokova, and Haiti's Minister of Culture and Communication Marie-Laurence Jocelyn Lass\u00e8gue. The Haitian delegation included among oth-ers Lass\u00e8gue's cultural advisor Magali Comeaux Denis, and ISPAN Director-General Daniel Elie. Scores of delegates from dozens of cultural organizations were in attendance. The presentations by the Minister and Daniel were stunning in demonstrating the complete and overwhelming scale of human, physical, and cul-tural destruction of Haiti's capital region. No specific plan was offered on how to address the cultural needs and challenges\u2014and it was clear to me that with no funds, bereft of staff, communications, and expertise, there was little capacity to do so. There were also some fundamental issues\u2014with so many Haitian cultural sites\u2014historic homes, churches, muse-ums, libraries, and galleries in private hands, how could government be most effective? Did the Haitian gov-ernment organizations even have the capacity to accept and coordinate international help if offered? Mounir addressed the assembly about training. I spoke about intangible cultural heritage and also the need for a cultural base camp. Carolyn Willson of the U.S.-UNESCO mission spoke of the need to get fenc-ing to protect cultural sites from looting. Others spoke with compassion and conviction about wanting to help. The UNESCO conference would result in a report of the discussions, the formation of an International Coordinating Committee for Haiti months later\u2014to which I was appointed, to be followed by more discus-sion, planning, and attempts to raise funds. UNESCO had come forward quickly following the earthquake with some funds and in-kind support in Haiti to help salvage, box, and store collections, and fence off sites. This was good work\u2014but I knew that a much larger scale activity was required, and with the rainy sea-son approaching in Haiti, UNESCO could not move quickly enough to raise money, organize an effort, and get things moving on the ground. Back in Washington, conferring with the State Department and with Secretary Clough, it was appar-ent to me that if something of suf cient impact was to be done, the Smithsonian would have to take the lead. We could work with ICCROM on training, we could work with U.S. Blue Shield and AIC, and within the Smithsonian on mobilizing expertise. I was confi-dent we could gain the support and collaboration of Haitian of cials and partners. What we needed though was the logistical support and cooperation of the U.S. government and funding. For that, with Wayne Clough's approval, I turned to the President's Committee on the Arts and the Humanities. The Secretary of the Smithsonian is an ex of cio member of the Committee. First Lady Michelle Obama is the honorary chair. It is a very prestigious group composed of the heads of the various U.S. agen-cies and organizations\u2014the Library of Congress, the Chairs of the National Endowment for the Arts, and the National Endowment for the Humanities, the Director of the Institute of Museum and Library Services, the Secretary of State, and Secretary of Education, as well as private, appointed members, like my friend Y o-Y o Ma, architect T om Mayne, actress Sarah Jessica Parker, and others. It is co-chaired by George Stevens and Margo Lion; Mary Schmidt Campbell is the Vice-Chair and Rachel Goslins the Executive Director. I discussed the prospect of a Haiti cultural recov- ery project with Rachel. She immediately understood its signi cance in light of other national and interna-tional cultural disasters. It was the type of project the President's Committee could play an important role in helping succeed. Since so many in the arts commu-nity were doing concerts, telethons, and other events to bene t the victims of the earthquake, we thought it would resonate with the Committee's membership. I presented the project to one of the Committee's subgroups at a meeting on February 25. Actress Kerry Washington, Black Entertainment T elevision co-founder Sheila Johnson, and others were genuinely sup-portive of the idea. Bryan Lourd, Managing Director of Creative Artists Agency was aiding Sean Penn in his humanitarian relief effort in Haiti and offered his help. Artist Chuck Close offered to provide a painting for auction to raise money for the project. The moral clout of having the President's Committee behind the project and ties of its members to possible funding buoyed my sense that we could develop a viable project. 49 INTERNATIONAL AND AMERICAN ORGANIZATIONS MOBILIZE NOT FOR SALE OR REPRODUCTIONTHE PRESIDENT'S COMMITTEE WEIGHS IN MARGO LION When the Smithsonian approached us for support of its recovery and restoration efforts in Haiti, we knew we wanted to help. The urgency of ensuring that Haiti's rich cultural leg-acy be saved provided an opportunity for the President's Committee to demonstrate the Administration's deep understanding of the irreplaceable value of a nation's cultural heritage to the story of its people. Our challenge was to mobilize partners and resources very quickly\u2014difficult under any circumstances and, in the context of the federal government, especially daunting. Fortunately, one of the institutional roles of the Committee is to act as a nexus between the private sector, the White House, and the other federal cultural agencies. And so we began looking for the right private partner to bring immediate support to the project, support that would bridge the gap between the Smithsonian's fast-approaching start date and the moment when federal resources might become available. At the same time, we reached out to our partners in the major federal cultural agencies\u2014the National Endowment for the Arts, the National Endowment for the Humanities, and the Institute of Museum and Library Services\u2014to request contributions from their discretionary funds as well as to lend their special expertise to the effort. We contacted First Lady Michelle Obama, the honorary Chairman of the Committee, and her staff, who were especially supportive and helpful at critical junctures in the early stages of the project. Happily, we were able to identify the perfect private partners in The Broadway League, who themselves were eager to contribute aid to Haiti, understanding the crucial importance of sal-vaging the country's cultural legacy for the future of all art forms, including but not limited to the theater. Our federal cultural partners came on board enthusiastically as well, and, in what may be record time, the Committee was able to gather the commitments, and political will to move the project forward. Building a partnership, especially one that is public/private and inter-agency, can be a tough uphill challenge. But the devastation to Haiti and the potential loss of its rich cultural history, and the courage and vision of our partners, gave us the chance to galvanize support around this tragedy and to make a concrete and lasting contribution to the remarkable work of the Smithsonian. Margo Lion is the Co-Chairman of the President's Committee on the Arts and the Humanities, an advisory committee to the White House on cultural issues. Mistakes have been made in the past, in times of great tragedy or upheaval, by not protecting and prioritizing a country's cultural heritage. This is a huge opportunity for us to say, \"we get it.\" \u2014Rachel Goslins, Executive Director, U.S. President's Committee on the Arts and the Humanities 50 INTERNATIONAL AND AMERICAN ORGANIZATIONS MOBILIZE NOT FOR SALE OR REPRODUCTIONU.S. STATE DEPARTMENT AIDS HAITIAN CULTURAL RECOVERY ANN STOCK Many parts of Haiti's society were affected by the earthquake, and its cultural heritage was no exception. As part of the U.S. Department of State's broader response to the earthquake, the Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs, and the Humanitarian Information Unit worked to identify and distribute information about at-risk cultural heritage sites in Port-au-Prince and throughout the country to disaster-response stakeholders. Direct grants from the Ambassadors Fund for Cultural Preservation assisted the Haitian government and its Institute de Sauvegarde du Patrimoine National (ISPAN) in its assessment of damage to and conservation of historic buildings. The Department also provided funding and expertise for the development of the International Council of Museums' Emergency Red List of Haitian Cultural Objects at Risk. This initiative allowed Haiti and the international community to preserve local cultural heritage by discouraging looting of sites. Through our Embassy in Port-au-Prince, the Department of State provided logistical support to the Smithsonian to bring together American, Haitian, and international organizations for a cultural recovery project. Working with the Smithsonian and the President's Committee on the Arts and the Humanities, the Department was able to provide crucial funding for the project. As Haiti recovers, the United States will continue to be a steadfast partner in the preservation of its rich history and cultural heritage. Working together, we will safeguard a key source of Haiti's national pride and reinforce the bonds of mutual understanding and respect between our two countries for future generations.

I would go with Cori Wegener and Diana N'Diaye. With Cori, we'd work on plans for what we were calling a cultural recovery base, and with Diana we'd look at what we could do for living artists, musicians, and purveyors of Haiti's culture.CHAPTER FOUR FORMING PARTNERSHIPS FOR THE HAITI CULTURAL RECOVERY PROJECT We trusted one another and we all saw the utter necessity of an immediate initiative that could rally public and private institutions, provide training, and help us develop protocols to organize future operations of conservation: an initiative that would effectively build a bridge out of the chaos. \u2014Lorraine Mangon\u00e8s, Executive Director, FOKAL\u2014Fondation Connaissance et Libert\u00e9 (Open Society Foundation, Haiti) Haitian artists and craftspeople educated and charmed visitors at the 2004 Smithsonian Folklife Festival.

In 2004, Haiti mounted a massive presentation of its living cultural heritage on the National Mall of the United States in Washington, D.C., at the Smithsonian Folklife Festival. It was a thoroughly collaborative project, occurring on the 200th anniversary of Haiti's Independence. I was one of the co-curators of the living exposition and one of the three Commissioners ap-pointed by the Government of Haiti to ensure its production. That challenging but immensely successful experience forged a strong professional relationship, and personal friendship be-tween key people at the Smithsonian and leading cultural gures in Haiti. Renewed over the years, those relationships became exceedingly important after the earth-quake. Richard Kurin reached out to me and our team to see what he and the Smithsonian could do to help with regard to the safeguarding and recovery of Haiti's cultural heritage. As I, the architect of historical monuments and former curator, had become Minister of Tourism in the Government, and now appointed to lead the Commission for the Emergency and Reconstruction, I was in a position to enable the important task of recovering, restoring, and preserving our heritage. Richard and I met in Port-au-Prince the rst week of March 2010 to gure out how a cul- tural recovery project might work. I was at the time formulating the overall plan for Haiti's reconstruction, a plan that recognized the importance of culture in the representation of the Haitian people, as well as its centrality to our tourism industry\u2014a major force in rebuilding the economy. By the end of April, much work had been done by the Smithsonian with and among Haitian cultural institutions. I led a Government technical mission to the United States, holding dis-cussions with leaders from the Departments of State and Commerce, U.S. AID, and others. With Richard, I discussed the historic role of the \"monuments men,\" the U.S. Army unit authorized by President Roosevelt to recover and repatriate looted Nazi art after World War II. I envi-sioned the effort in Haiti in similar historic terms\u2014a way of recovering our national memory by safeguarding the collections, archives, libraries, museums, and other markers of our national identity. Rescuing our cultural heritage was a form of empowerment, a means by which Haiti could reclaim and re-develop its spiritual legitimacy. As we forged the initial agreement between the Government of Haiti and the Smithsonian, two things were foremost in my mind\u2014consistent with our overall policy approach. First, the Haiti Cultural Recovery Project would have to support the rebuilding and reconstruction of Haitian state institutions. The project would have to cooperate closely with Haitian of cials charged with responsibilities for our cultural patrimony. The project would have to operate within the legal framework of Haiti, gaining permission from both public and private sector organizations to do its work. Second, the project would have to encourage the building and development of Haitian capacities to safeguard its cultural heritage. The employment and training of Haitians through the project was an important goal. On behalf of the Smithsonian and the Government of Haiti, Richard and I signed a memoran- dum of understanding to proceed with the project on April 20, 2010. Haiti's Ambassador to the United States, Raymond Joseph, co-signed as a witness. I was pleased as Minister of Tourism and Chairman of the Emergency and Reconstruction Commission to initiate the partnership, to play a role in facilitating contacts between various associated organizations, and to ensure, on behalf of the Government, the smooth running of the project. 53 FORMING PARTNERSHIPS FOR THE HAITI CULTURAL RECOVERY PROJECT NOT FOR SALE OR REPRODUCTIONThe rst task, establishing a cultural recovery base, would be quite complicated, I realized. It was simply impractical to buy or rent tents, generators, portable toilets, flooring, and other equipment in the United States and ship them to Haiti. The backlog of materi-als for rescue and other forms of humanitarian assis-tance trying to get through Haiti's T oussaint Louverture Airport, or by road from the Dominican Republic, or through Port-au-Prince's damaged port was over-whelming. The cost of transport would be astronomical. Bryan Lourd put me in touch with some of Sean Penn's staff thinking that perhaps they had some tents we could use. Their tents were suitable for home shelters, not of the size we would need. In discussing with Rachel Goslins what to do, she referred me to someone she'd gotten to know, retired General Nolen Bivens. Nolen offered just the right combination of knowledge, for he was an experienced military guy involved in the arts. I explained what we needed and Nolen almost literally drew a roadmap for how to get it. We would seek the assistance of the Joint Task Force (JTF) of the U.S. Army Southern Command which was lead-ing the military response in Haiti to see if they could provide tents, generators, flooring, air condition-ers, fencing, and equipment for our work. Then, on land they occupied, or granted through the Haitian government, or even rented, we could operate a cul-tural recovery base. Scores of e-mails flew in the days before our trip to Haiti, moving up and through the chain of command and to different\u2014and for me a bewildering\u2014panoply of offices in the Defense Department and the Army until we made contact with the staff of Lt. General Keen, the Commander of the Joint Task Force, and arranged a meeting. IN HAITI Cori, Diana, and I, accompanied by Greg Borstede of the Department of State, arrived in Haiti on March 6 for key meetings with U.S. and Haitian of cials and leaders. The State Department, through the Embassy, and in the person of Information Officer Shaila Manyam, was immensely helpful in providing a van and driver and arranging meetings in the Embassy, and with U.S. AID. We were grateful, given that staff in the Embassy had been working 24/7 for weeks, sleeping on fl oors, and were exhausted. Substantively, it was clear that no cultural response was in place or even under consideration. There was even a question about whether a cultural recovery proj-ect was needed and whether it quali ed as \"humanitar- ian assistance.\" As a cultural anthropologist I was a bit stunned\u2014at least philosophically\u2014for culture is what makes us human; but I well understood the regula-tory and bureaucratic nature of such de nitional issues. U.S. AID was involved in a massive assistance effort. I thought cultural aid might be a small, even tiny part of its recovery plans since the arts and handicrafts sec-tor is so large in Haiti, and hundreds of thousands of people depend upon their creative produce for a living. Reviving that seemed to me to be a good, easy, clean, low investment way of re-kindling Haiti's economy. We explored the possibility of U.S. AID supporting the recovery efforts at cultural sites through its \"work for cash\" program. U.S. AID was paying Haitians ve dol- lars per day to shovel rubble so it could be taken away. We wondered if Haitians could be paid the same to shovel \"cultural rubble\" at the collapsed Holy Trinity Episcopal Cathedral, so that it could be saved and reconstituted. It was not to be.[Left] Richard Kurin holding a fragment of a painting from the Nader Museum.

Photo by Richard Kurin/Smithsonian 54 FORMING PARTNERSHIPS FOR THE HAITI CULTURAL RECOVERY PROJECT NOT FOR SALE OR REPRODUCTIONA meeting with General Keen at Camp Dragon, the JTF headquarters on land adjacent to the U.S. Embassy, proved to be more positive. Camp Dragon was an encampment of tents, generators, portable bathrooms, fencing, and equipment\u2014just what we'd need for our cultural recovery base. The General was empathetic and accommodating. \"Richard, we'd really like to help you,\" he said. We talked about the military leaving some of its supplies and equipment in place in Haiti for the Smithsonian to use after the U.S. military re-deployed out of the country. All we'd have to do is arrange for the State Department to give the orders, since they were the lead agency in the Haiti response. And we'd just have to make sure that such an arrange-ment fell within the various laws and regulations that governed the use of the assets. In some cases, since the military contracts for rather than owns items, the issue would be to transfer contracts from the Defense Department to the Smithsonian. It seemed like a bureaucratic nightmare\u2014but if doable, we'd get it done. Meeting Haitian colleagues was of course the key to the trip. Arranging for Haitian artists to participate in the upcoming summer Smithsonian Folklife Festival was easy to do. We met with Georges Nader who had participated in 2004, and had ready recommenda-tions. We met with Giselle Fleurant, who'd set up the crafts sales program at the Festival before, and she was again ready to help. We committed $25,000 on the spot to the buying of Haitian crafts to sell at the Festival Marketplace. This would immediately get craftspeople to work producing those goods. Georges told us about artists who wanted to paint, but couldn't given the lack of brushes, canvases, and paints in the country. We immediately devised the idea of artists care packages and before we left, Georges had a list of precisely the brands and colors, and the types of brushes and can-vases most needed by painters in Haiti. We'd go back to Washington, get the word out with the speci cations, and people would send the care packages to Georges to distribute to artists. We had the bene t of recent assessment reports of damages to cultural sites and collections compiled by UNESCO's Fernando Brugman, ICOMOS President Gustavo Aroaz, and others. With Daniel Elie and Monique Rocourt, we visited sites like the National Cathedral, caved-in and rubble abounding\u2014yet with its magni cent stained glass surviving. We climbed the rubble at the Holy Trinity Episcopal Cathedral, with its surviving mural walls, wounded, yet, standing some-what proudly and de antly amidst the ruins. There was clearly rescue and recovery work to be done. Similarly with Nader's collection of paintings\u2014thousands upon thousands of which were stacked up with varying rents and tears, and the more damaged of which laid literally in shreds and pieces. With Smithsonian and AIC con-servators, we clearly could be of help reclaiming these endangered treasures. I looked at the paintings and saw them in rubble. I thought at rst we wouldn't be able to recover any of them. But then we started digging and we thought\u2014it is possible to save them, we just needed some help. \u2014Georges Nader, Nader Museum 55 FORMING PARTNERSHIPS FOR THE HAITI CULTURAL RECOVERY PROJECT NOT FOR SALE OR REPRODUCTIONWe met with Minister Lass\u00e8gue's cultural advisor Magali Comeaux Denis. We discussed what we had in mind and how it might be done. She advised us to develop a proposal or memorandum of understanding that would fully involve the Haitian Government and meet its approval. Meetings with Patrick Delatour, Olsen Jean Julien, and Patrick Vilaire, went well. Patrick Delatour was working on the big government plan for recovery and reconstruction, but as was his pas-sion, vitally concerned about the survival of Haiti's heritage collections and historical buildings. Patrick Vilaire was designing adaptations of sea containers, so they could be better used for storing collections of art and books. He was putting the sea containers on land near the airport, at a site run by Haiti Habitat and owned by the Mangon\u00e8s family. Olsen was work-ing with FOKAL\u2014a Haitian non-governmental, Soros Foundation-af liated cultural and educational organization\u2014to save Haiti's wooden, \"gingerbread\" houses. Both, Olsen and Patrick Vilaire, would help work on a cultural recovery project if we could muster the wherewithal to put it together. We met with Mich\u00e8le Pierre-Louis, and Lorraine Mangon\u00e8s, respectively the President and Executive Director of FOKAL. I knew both from 2004 , and Mich\u00e8le had gone on to serve as Prime Minister under President Pr\u00e9val. She was now again a private citizen. Both were dedicated cultural advocates and leaders. They encouraged a Smithsonian-led project that would necessitate the involvement of the Haitian govern-ment but that also addressed the pressing needs of numerous private museums, libraries, archives, and galleries. Lorraine indicated that we could use the land at the Haiti Habitat site for a cultural recovery base. I knew we would also need a fiscal agent in Haiti\u2014a local organization, preferably a non-pro t, that could contract for goods and services, keep a bank account, and provide scal oversight. FOKAL would be ideal for such a role, and they agreed. Before leaving Haiti we were able to stop at the Haiti Habitat site and scope out its potential use as a base. It was relatively fl at land, had no electricity or other infra-structure, but had a good, potentially secure loca-tion\u2014not far from the airport, but also off the beaten track. We'd need to secure the area, but if we received tents and fl ooring, generators, and other equipment from General Keen, it could work. Land owned by Haiti Habitat near the airport was rst considered as a possible site for a cultural recovery base. Photo by Corine Wegener 56 FORMING PARTNERSHIPS FOR THE HAITI CULTURAL RECOVERY PROJECT NOT FOR SALE OR REPRODUCTIONMOBILIZING THE MILITARY NOLEN BIVENS My role in helping the Smithsonian implement a cultural relief and recovery effort in Haiti began when I was introduced to Rich ard Kurin via e-mail by Rachel Goslins of the President's Committee on the Arts and the Humanities in mid-February. Richard sought my advice on what resources might be provided to such an effort by the U.S. military forces performing humanitar - ian assistance and disaster relief operations in Haiti\u2014and how he could get their key logistical support. The military's role during this type of crisis is always \"in support of\" the priorities set by the U.S. State Department, and U.S. Agency for International Development's Of ce of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance. Their initial focus was search and rescue, and disaster relief. Given that the process for gaining military support can be lengthy, I knew building partnerships for the cultural recov ery project would require rapid, concurrent, and multi-layered actions. I immediately contacted the Deputy Chief of Staff, U.S. Southern Command in Miami, Hubert Newman, to gain an appreciation of the operation in order to best advise the Smithsonian. To that end, I suggested the following key actions to Richard: \u0081 Introduce the project concept and requests for support to the U.S. Department of Defense through U.S. State Department channels, and speci cally the Of ce of the Secretary of State, prior to his initial assessment visit; \u0081 Jump-start the inter-agency coordination process by including the U.S. Embassy in Haiti on all communiqu\u00e9s regarding the project; \u0081 Simultaneously, contact the U.S. Department of Defense Joint Visitors Bureau in Port-au-Prince to arrange a meeting with the U.S. Commander, Joint Task Force Haiti, Lieutenant General Ken Keen to discuss logistical support assistance during his initial trip; \u0081 Inform the U.S. Southern Command's Of ce of Foreign Disaster Assistance representative of his effort to establish a cultural recovery project. During his assessment trip to Haiti the rst week of March, Richard met with several U.S. Government of cials, including General Keen, David Lindwall (Deputy Chief of Mission, U.S. Embassy), Mervyn Farroe (Supervisory Program Officer, U.S. Agency for International Development) and others to gure out what resources could possibly be applied to the project. This led to subsequent discussions in Washington with the U.S. State Department and requests to USSOUTHCOM to provide logistical assistance. This site visit by the Smithsonian led to the identi cation of a site for a cultural recovery base, and for the provision of military logistics equipment to the Smithsonian, as U.S. troops withdrew from Haiti. Unexpectedly though, the U.S. deployment was extended. We had to switch gears. Fortunately the contacts made proved adaptable. The Naval Facilities Engineering Command (NAVFEC) was prepared to help out and identify an alternative location and help certif y its safety. Obtaining U.S. military assistance in a foreign country involves a formal multi-step request process starting with a host natio n request and ending with an Executive Secretariat Memorandum to the U.S. Department of Defense. Achieving this is no easy feat. It depends upon quickly building successful partnerships and hinges on rapid actions executed simultaneously across the interagenc y domain. Partnership opportunities for projects exist via the U.S. security cooperation operations abroad that routinely interact with partner nations, other U.S government agencies and organizations in a \"whole of government\" fashion. Cultural operations are no t typically included, but in this case, Haitian and U.S. Government support for the recovery effort enabled its success.

Having served in the military for more than twenty years I have seen my share of poverty and destruction, but the combination was overwhelming. I was glad to be with Richard Kurin and Diana N'Diaye of the Smithsonian, both of whom had been to Haiti many times before, and Greg Borgstede from the U.S. Department of State. Richard and I had developed the basic plan of establishing an emergency cultural recovery center in Port-au-Prince and I had suggested we ask the U.S. military for help. Now we just had to convince everyone else the plan was feasible. Upon arriving in Port-au-Prince we were met by U.S. Embassy staffer Shaila Manyam\u2014her knowledge of the Haitian cultural community, and language skills proved invaluable. In just a few short days we visited a number of damaged cultural sites, including the Holy Trinity Episcopal Cathedral, the Nader Gallery and Museum, the National Cathedral, and several others. The murals at Holy Trinity Cathedral are my most vivid memory of that rst visit. The faces of Jesus and the apostles staring out at me from Philom\u00e9 Obin's Last Supper seemed to be pleading for rescue. A whirlwind of meetings ensued, starting at the U.S. Embassy, then on to Camp Dragon to meet with Lieutenant General P.K. Keen, Commander of Joint Task Force (JTF) Haiti. This was a particularly strange meeting for me\u2014I had always been the one in uniform meeting with NGOs asking for help-now the tables were turned. We discussed borrowing equipment such as tents and generators that JTF Haiti might be able to leave behind and we left with a tentative agreement to work the deal through the U.S. Embassy and the U. S. State Department. The most critical meetings of the trip took place with our Haitian colleagues, both in government and the cultural heri- tage community. Without their buy-in, our project could not go forward. Richard had many contacts in Haiti from produc-ing the 2004 Smithsonian Folklife Festival, and seemed to already know everyone. The Haitian response to our offer of help was very positive, but these would be just the rst of many such meetings before we had a practical, viable plan, the resources to support it, and the agreement of Haitian and American partners needed to bring it to fruition. 58 FORMING PARTNERSHIPS FOR THE HAITI CULTURAL RECOVERY PROJECT NOT FOR SALE OR REPRODUCTIONTRUST TO BUILD A BRIDGE OUT OF CHAOS LORRAINE MANGON\u00c8S At 5 p.m. on January 12, I was to inaugurate FOKAL's multi- media exhibit on Katherine Dunham's life and work in Haiti. That moment never came and, as of that night, FOKAL's of- ces remained closed for weeks. About six hundred refugees\u2014among them a dozen of our employees\u2014camped in the parking lot. We moved operations to the building where I rent an apartment, not far from the Foundation, and where the owner kindly let us use a room on the ground fl oor. All meetings were held under a tree in the yard where we were less panicked by aftershocks. We spent days and nights reaching out to friends, fam- ily, partner institutions, trying to bury the dead, count the living, and run rescue operations of all kinds. People from the arts and culture sector came to meet with us under the tree. Artists, intellectuals, cultural managers, all reel-ing from the sheer magnitude of it all, were trying to pull resources together. One night, Olsen Jean Julien called Mich\u00e8le Pierre-Louis and me to a meeting at the Olofsson Hotel with Richard Kurin, from the Smithsonian, and Corine Wegener, from the U.S. Committee of the Blue Shield. To me, that night was the beginning of the Haiti Cultural Recovery Project. We trusted one another and we all saw the utter necessity of an im-mediate initiative that could rally public and private insti-tutions, provide training, and help us develop protocols to organize future operations of conservation: an initiative that would effectively build a bridge out of the chaos. Lorraine Mangon\u00e8s is the Executive Director of FOKAL, the Foundation for Knowledge and Freedom (Fondation Connaissance et Libert\u00e9), an Open Society Foundation.FORGING THE PARTNERSHIP MICH\u00c8LE D. PIERRE-LOUIS Establishing a collaborative partnership between Haitian and international institutions, public and private, was a major but necessary challenge for any project seeking to rescue Haitian cultural heritage in the face of the disaster. All the parties understood the priceless value of what had to be saved in these dramatic circumstances, and the risk of irreparable loss. They thus resolved to join together and undertake actions to save the things that mark our identity and refl ect our culture. The Smithsonian, a specialized, experienced, and well-intentioned institution, sought to save thousands of objects of our cultural and historical heritage devastated by the earthquake. To do so, as a \"foreign\" organization, it had to work with, and obtain the formal approval of Haitian gov-ernment authorities. An initial authorization of the Ministry of Tourism, followed by a memorandum of understanding with the Ministry of Culture, secured the commitment of the public sector. This was absolutely crucial and allowed for subsequent partnerships which could then be formed to give shape to the effort. FOKAL agreed to act as scal agent. Private institutions such as the Nader Museum, the Centre d'Art, the Episcopal Cathedral, and the Sugar Cane Museum, subscribed to the project so as to bene t from the expertise of foreign specialists versed in meth-ods and techniques of conservation and restoration, and to take advantage of the training opportunities offered to dozens of Haitians. Public institutions such as the National Pantheon Museum, the National Archives, National Library, and the Institute for the Protection of National Heritage, also agreed to participate, as did a number of international cultural organizations. As the project developed it would have to rely on all the partners to participate and contribute to the whole effort and sustain the larger collective interest. Mich\u00e8le D.

The Haiti Cultural Recovery Project is built upon this basic truth. Involved at the very beginning of the project, I understood that a collaborative effort from four types of partners was crucial for this project to succeed: the Haitian Government, Haitian, U.S., and international institutions that could provide support to help in solving practical problems, the Haitian cultural agencies and private organizations which own col-lections, and the Haitian media. As Project Manager, by the means of a series of differentiated agreements and through constant, active communication, I bridged those four types of partners, so they could keep working together to help reach the project's stated goals. The Haitian Government, through the Ministry of Culture and Communication, and the Ministry of Tourism, played lead- ership roles in the de nition of the project's objectives and mechanisms. They each signed framework agreements for the project with the Smithsonian Institution. I also worked closely with both Ministers and their staffs, as well as the Fondation Connaissance & Libert\u00e9 (FOKAL) to de ne the procedures and create the instruments needed to solve complex administrative issues. In Haiti collections belong to a large variety of private and public cultural institutions. After the earthquake there was no single approach all of these organizations took. Many pursued their own, different initiatives to save their collections. We wanted the Haiti Cultural Recovery Project to take into account the diversity of these approaches, and respond ac- cordingly. This was absolutely necessary because we had no coercive power, no ability to force or command people to do what we wanted done or thought best to do. Therefore, we had to learn from each organization's perspective, needs, experience, and post-earthquake initiatives to safeguard their collections. From the beginning of March to the end of May 2010, we visited and discussed the possible ways we could help many cultural institutions with collections endangered by the earthquake. This learning attitude was the key to forging the trust and to building the partnerships we needed on the ground in Haiti. Among the organizations consulted were Haitian radio and television stations. With them we worked to address the problem of the recovery of cultural materials in audio-visual formats. This demonstrated that we valued their work as a cultural contribution to Haitian society. I would later hire two communication consultants to work with the Haitian me-dia, and in turn, the media spread the word about the project. This built the momentum and educated the cultural sector and the general public about the importance of conserving cultural materials as part of Haiti's reconstruction process. Finally, as we devised training programs, I knew we would best succeed if we trained people who were already working with various cultural organizations. They would have some skills and also a knowledge of and commitment to the institu- tion. Those institutions would see the training as an investment in their survival and improvement. Overall, this strategy encouraged various partners to make great commitments. This would lead to not only saving Haitian cultural materials but also in enhancing a community of trust and cooperation\u2014a key element of Haiti's future economic and social development.

The works kept at the Centre d'Art, the artisanal workshops of Jacmel, archives, libraries, the National Cathedral, the Church of the Saint King of France, and the Holy Trinity Episcopal Cathedral all suffered incredible damage. Saving this heritage was a huge task. The Government of Haiti had to react immediately and respond quickly to the emergencies of the hour. Haitians in the cultural sector saved what they could. Gestures of sympathy came from around the world, from many people and institutions. Among the demonstrations of solidarity, the Smithsonian stood out for its offer of nancial assistance to save movable cultural property endangered by the earthquake. The Ministry of Culture and Communication and the Smithsonian began serious discussions, and by April, I had a team working on the project, coordinating with the Smithsonian, and consolidating and guiding the Government's interests and involvement. In early May, I travelled to Washington to meet with the Secretary of the Smithsonian, and U.S. cultural leaders including those from the President's Committee on the Arts and the Humanities. Arrangements were made and by May 24, I signed an agreement with the Smithsonian creat- ing the Haiti Cultural Recovery Center. This would lead to many steps and concrete actions to repair the cultural damage. The Center's purpose was to catalog, stabilize, secure, and restore works of art, artifacts, archi- tectural elements, archives, books, lms, videos, sound recordings, and other media damaged or endangered by the earthquake. The agreement provided for the Smithsonian Institution to manage the Center's daily operations while also creating a steering committee composed of Directors-General of the ve autonomous cultural agencies in the Minister's portfolio\u2014the heads of ISPAN, the National Library, the National Archives, the Bureau of Ethnology, and MUPANAH, the National Museum. The plan was to work together for some eighteen months to achieve our objectives for the bene t of both public and private institutions, and their collections. It was a partnership des- tined to bear fruit. Marie-Laurence Jocelyn Lass\u00e8gue is Minister of Culture and Communication, Republic of Haiti.

MARTIN Within twenty-four hours after the Haitian earthquake, calls started fl ooding into my of ce with questions about \"how we could help.\" Our members were anxious to lend a hand. Ours is a compassionate and impatient industry composed of people who want action and want it now. So we had a board meeting and immediately approved the idea of making a donation for Haitian relief. Several other members quickly indicated a desire to add donations. One show, Mamma Mia, felt so strongly about the issue that they gave a portion of ticket sales to our fund. The real issue was where to make the donation. I was charged with examining the many charitable causes being identified and I asked for recommendations from the Executive Committee. An Executive Committee member, Margo Lion, is Co-Chair of the President's Committee on the Arts and the Humanities and called with the idea of partnering with the Smithsonian. I loved the idea as it tied our donation to a cultural institution whose goal was to help save the culture of Haiti. As Broadway is so much a part of New York, we are able to see and experience what culture means to a city. After September 11, it was clear how important Broadway was to the spirit of New York City when Mayor Rudy Giuliani worked with Broadway leaders to get Broadway back up and running. A vibrant robust culture signals that a city or country is fully alive and recovering. When I started canvassing our of cers about the donation to the Smithsonian, we built consensus quickly as all felt that Haitian art was as important to the culture of Haiti as Broadway theatre is to New York City. Working with the Smithsonian was as personal and easy as working with an institution can be. The communication they had with us was critical and later culminated with the trip to Haiti by our Chair, Vice-Chair, Margo, and me. It inspired us and we were able to bring back the message that our funds were truly going to a project that would take action and be rel-evant to arts, and culture. Charlotte St. Martin is Executive Director of The Broadway League. The Broadway League is a 501(c)6 national trade association representing commercial theatre across the United States.

There are many things the government does well in times of disaster; moving quickly on funding is not one of them, even when the desire and intent is there. \u2014Rachel Goslins, Executive Director, President's Committee on the Arts and the Humanities 63 FORMING PARTNERSHIPS FOR THE HAITI CULTURAL RECOVERY PROJECT NOT FOR SALE OR REPRODUCTIONBACK IN WASHINGTON I returned to Washington con dent that arrangements were falling into place. The project was needed, key Haitians would help arrange for, manage, and operate the project. We had a place for a base. Now I needed to get the State Department to give orders to the Defense Department to help us. And, we were going to need some money. As it turns out, we got lucky. The day I returned from Haiti, First Lady Michelle Obama was coming to the Smithsonian's National Museum of American History to donate her inaugural gown that would be mounted in the perennially popular First Ladies gallery. I briefed Wayne Clough on the Haiti trip, the results and our needs. He would have a few moments with Mrs. Obama and took the opportunity to brief her on our cultural recovery efforts and what we needed. She agreed to help. This was especially opportune because President and Mrs. Pr\u00e9val were in Washington, visiting with President and Mrs. Obama and of course discussing the situation in Haiti. The next day, Elisabeth Pr\u00e9val came to my of ce at the Smithsonian Castle, and I was able to brief her on the project and also let her know what we needed from the Haitian side to make it work. As a promoter of Haitian culture with a background in business management, she understood how important and uplifting the project to save Haiti's heritage could be. As a bonus, the National Museum of African Art had just acquired a larger-than-life sized sculpture of T oussaint Louverture created by the Senegalese artist Ousmane Sow. It was still in storage, being prepared for exhibition. Johnnetta Cole took Elisabeth Pr\u00e9val to see this inspirational work, which doubly lifted her spirits. We now had both First Ladies on board. In Washington, the State Department issued orders to General Keen to help the Smithsonian. In Haiti, the project began to gain official traction. Patrick Delatour came to Washington. On behalf of the Haitian Government and in his capacity as Minister of T ourism and Chair of the Commission for the Emergency and Reconstruction, he signed a memorandum of under-standing creating the Haiti Cultural Recovery Project. The Smithsonian would be responsible for nancing the project and cooperate closely with Haitian authori-ties in identifying and treating heritage collections and sites, public and private, and doing so with the proper permissions in place. The Smithsonian agreed that training and capacity building was a vital component of the project. The project would run until November 1, 2011, which covered the emergency period of Patrick's Commission. Following this, we began negotiating a parallel agreement with the Ministry of Culture and Communication detailing in more speci c terms how the project would actually operate in Haiti, including a steering committee composed of the heads of the Haitian government cultural agencies that would help de ne, and prioritize projects of national signi cance. Now I needed money.Here again, the President's Committee came through. Rachel Goslins suggested the Smithsonian in partnership with the Committee ask the other federal cultural agency heads to make discretionary grants to the project. Rocco Landesman, Chair of the National Endowment for the Arts, Jim Leach, Chair of the National Endowment for the Humanities, and Marsha Semmel, Acting Director of the Institute of Museum and Library Services, quickly agreed to make grants of $30,000 each. The funds would go to the American Institute for Conservation, which worked closely with IMLS on collections rescue and training. AIC would use the funds to support the travel and per diem costs of trained, volunteer conservators to deploy to Haiti to work at the cultural recovery base. It would also cover some costs of conservation supplies and equipment they could carry down in their luggage. This was a start. Rachel identified a private group with close ties to Margo Lion\u2014The Broadway League\u2014as a possible large initial funder of the project. I knew that whatever might happen with govern- ment funding, it would take at least months to put in place. The Department of State was developing a bud-get for a supplemental appropriations bill to submit to Congress. That bill would cover the funds needed and already expended by the U.S. military in the humani-tarian relief operation. It would cover funds needed by the State Department, largely through U.S. AID, to pro-vide support promised to Haiti for food, shelter, rubble clearing, government operations, and select infrastruc-tural recovery projects. The proposed appropriation would be in the billions, and I was working with of - cials to try to secure a few million dollars for cultural relief and recovery. Nonetheless, even if successful, it would take time\u2014and we needed to get started quickly as the rainy season in Haiti was fast approaching. A private donor was needed, and I couldn't have been prouder as a native New Y orker that it was Broadway that stepped forward to contribute $ 276,000 they had raised for Haitian relief following the earthquake. As people who went through the horrors of September 11 , they deeply understood the role of culture in the social psychological recovery of a city, and thus reached out to help folks in Haiti cope with their tragedy. Now all the elements were in place. On May 5 , we scheduled a meeting in Washington to bring every-one together to announce the Haiti Cultural Recovery Project. This would include Ministers Lass\u00e8gue and Delatour from the official Haitian side\u2014as well as Fran\u00e7oise Thybulle, the Director-General of Haiti's 64 FORMING PARTNERSHIPS FOR THE HAITI CULTURAL RECOVERY PROJECT NOT FOR SALE OR REPRODUCTIONNational Library, Wayne Clough, Margo Lion, Rachel Goslins, Jim Leach, Rocco Landesman, Marsha Semmel, and me from the of cial U.S. side.

IMLS has a long history of providing support for the care and preservation of all types of museum col-lections that represent our artistic, historic, and scienti c heritage. In 2003, the agency supported a landmark project, the Heritage Health Index, which was the rst comprehensive survey of the state of our nation's objects, documents, and digital materials. A Public Trust at Risk: The Heritage Health Index Report on the State of America's Collections, was published in 2005, and its ndings led to an IMLS-led initiative, Connecting to Collections: A Call to Action, which supported a series of regional, national, and interna-tional forums; a curated \"bookshelf\" (a twenty-three-text set of conservation must-reads and on-line resources) distributed to more than 3,000 museums and libraries around the United States and throughout the world; and a variety of grant programs, including planning and implementation grants to states for collaborative efforts among museums, libraries, and archives, to assess and address pressing conservation and preservation needs. The agency has always supported the training of conservation professionals, and in the wake of Hurricanes Rita and Katrina, IMLS provided funds to the American Institute of Conservation of Historic and Artistic Works (AIC) to create the Conservation Emergency Response Team (CERT), a corps of specially trained conservators equipped to handle conservation challenges arising in the wake of natural disasters and other emergencies. Hence, when the devastating earthquake hit Haiti, IMLS was eager to join the Smithsonian Institution, the President's Committee on the Arts and the Humanities, and the National Endowments of the Arts and the Humanities to be part of the U.S. efforts to rescue, recover, safeguard, and help restore Haiti's cultural patrimony. We were proud that members of CERT joined conservators from the Smithsonian, and the U.S. Committee of the Blue Shield in this vital work. Marsha Semmel served as Acting Director of the Institute of Museum and Library Services. She is currently its Director for Strategic Partnerships. 66 FORMING PARTNERSHIPS FOR THE HAITI CULTURAL RECOVERY PROJECT NOT FOR SALE OR REPRODUCTIONIt was clear to me that the Smithsonian could have a meaningful impact on Haiti's cultural recovery.ASSESSING THE WHAT, WHERE, AND HOW L. H. (HUGH) SHOCKEY, JR. As a conservator with disaster recovery experience, I expected my rst trip to Haiti would be to salvage and triage collection items in the earthquake's rubble. Instead, Richard Kurin had something a bit more complex in mind. He asked me to accompany a team of Smithsonian engineers on a trip to evaluate a building identi ed as a potential location for the Cultural Recovery Center, and also join with conservators from the AIC to assess the needs of cultural collections effected by the disaster. Over a week of long days packed with visits to public and private cultural institutions, meeting with the stakeholders and learning about the needs of their collections, I was struck by how much cultural material the Haitians had already salvaged, ready for the next steps of recov-ery. Synthesizing my observations and the opinions of engineers, collections custodians, and conservation colleagues both in Haiti and in the United States, I recommended moving ahead with establishing a Cultural Recovery Center. It was clear to me that the Smithsonian could have a meaningful impact on Haiti's cultural recovery. Hugh Shockey and Kate Tayler of the New York Times examine the ruins of Holy Trinity Cathedral.

We had to nd an alternative. Without military aid, operating out of tents with generators would have turned out to be too expensive and impractical. Good leads came our way, and in the end we were able to secure the former United Nations Development Program building and compound in the Bourdon area of Port-au-Prince for our use as a Cultural Recovery Center. Finding a modern building of the right size, in a good location, with strong security, and the proper climate control conditions was a big victory for the project. Of course we were concerned about the building's structural integrity\u2014it was only a few hundred yards from two major buildings\u2014the upscale Montana Hotel, and the Hotel Christopher, serving as a home to U.N. staff\u2014both of which had collapsed, killing hundreds. U.S. Navy and Smithsonian engineers conducted their tests and assessments, and found the building sound. It had been designed by a Haitian architect who had studied methods of concrete use in Germany. Smithsonian staff strongly advised that we needed an ongoing, continual supervisory presence in Haiti to de ne, oversee, and implement professional standards in the project's substantive conservation work. We needed a chief conservator who would live and work in Haiti, and do so under trying, fl uid circumstances. The per-son would have to be fl uent in French to communicate to Haitians working at the Recovery Center as well as with the leaders and staff of the various Haitian organi-zations allowing us to work on their sites and with their collections. It would be a tough job to ll with just the right person. That person was Stephanie Hornbeck. Stephanie had retired from her Smithsonian position as Conservator with the National Museum of African Art at the beginning of January\u2014a week before the earth-quake. She'd relocated to Miami. After the earthquake, Stephanie e-mailed me\u2014she'd heard that we were orga-nizing a cultural conservation project as a response. She wanted to know what she could do to help. Stephanie was fluent in French and quite familiar with Haitian art\u2014she'd done her master's thesis on the Haitian Renaissance. \"Do I have a job for you,\" I told her. We concluded a contract, and Stephanie was on board. Stephanie's job would essentially be to design the conservation program of the Center. Working off of the priorities set by the Haitians, she would develop the protocols and procedures by which items were then treated. She would have to set up the conservation stu-dios and labs, ordering supplies, and equipment. She would coordinate the relationship with the American Institute for Conservation, working closely with Eric Pourchot to schedule the deployments of conservators with different specialties and expertise. She would also contact Smithsonian conservators, many of whom were alerted to the project by Hugh Shockey, and schedule their deployment to Haiti. At the Center, Stephanie would then make assignments and oversee their work. She would closely coordinate logistics with Olsen Jean Julien, the Center's Manager, and she'd have to explain treatments, and inspire con dence among those collec-tions owners and stewards who would be giving us their treasures for treatment. For the huge task of managing the Center, I could not have had more con dence in Olsen. He was respected by Haitian of cials and those in the cultural sector as he had served as the immediate past Minister of Culture and Communication. Trained as a histori-cal architect, he had credibility as a professional with technical expertise. He'd worked for the Smithsonian Festival in 2004, and had done a fantastic job attending to every detail of the complex production\u2014obtaining passports and visas for more than 150 Haitian partici- pants, arranging transportation and transport for exhibi-tion materials and commercial goods, ordering tents and sound systems, developing presentations, dealing with meals and hotel rooms, coordinating technical, publi-cation, and presentational needs, and overseeing scores of staff and volunteers daily. Fluent in English and of course French and Krey\u00f2l, he well knew American and Haitian sensibilities and concerns. Solid and rm in demeanor, with a joyful disposi- tion, and a wonderful sense of irony, there was no more perfect person to run the Center. He had to hire staff, rent vehicles, arrange improvements on the building, communicate with the Haitian media, and do the thou-sands of other things necessary to make the project work. Cori Wegener too kept up her involvement, helping to establish trust among Haitian cultural institu-tions during the course of various visits in the lead-up to the Center's opening. She proved invaluable in nego-tiating with the military, helping to establish the Center, coordinating with ICCROM, Blue Shield, and other international organizations, advising on operations, and informing many others of our progress. Cori, Olsen, Stephanie, and I e-mailed each other hundreds, maybe thousands of times during the course of the project. Clear, professional, committed, and focused, we sought to get the Center opened by June 1, less than ve months after the earthquake. Not a speedy response, but, given the situation, a respectable one. The key leadership of the Haiti Cultural Recovery Center at its inception in June 2010 includes Training Coordinator Fritz Berg Jeannot, Registrar Carmelita Douby, Chief Conservator Stephanie Hornbeck, Of ce Manager Joseph Jean Baptiste Mentor, and Manager Olsen Jean Julien.

In Haiti, it was very clear that the Foundation of the American Institute for Conservation (FAIC) could mobilize volunteers, and also had access to a great deal of expertise in equipping and supplying conservation laboratories. This became our fo-cus in the partnership. At the same time, we had to let go of trying to control many other factors\u2014calendars, choice of housing, which collections would be worked on, etc. The Smithsonian Institution paved the way for funding and working with various branches of the Haitian government. The U.S. Committee of the Blue Shield built relationships with international organizations as well as the U.S. military . As we learned to trust each organization's expertise, everything be- gan to get easier. By the end of March, FAIC had submitted an emergency fund- ing request to the National Endowment for the Humanities, followed up by requests to the National Endowment for the Arts, and the Institute of Museum and Library Services. On May 3, two AIC-CERT volunteer conservators, Susan S. Blakney and Vicki Lee, accompanied Corine Wegener to Port-au-Prince to assess the situation and scout possible work sites. The real work had begun. AIC Collections Emergency Response Team (AIC-CERT) volun- Lee, Karen Pavelka, and Beverly Perkins, helped to assess, set up, and equip the conservation laboratories at the new Haiti Cultural Recovery Center. Later FAIC supported trips by Rosa Lowinger and Viviana Dominguez, to evaluate the murals at the Holy Trinity Episcopal Cathedral. This early work was as much about fundraising and friend raising as it was about recovery of materials. It was very im- portant to demonstrate to the Haitian government and those responsible for collections that serious and well-informed work could be done, and would be done with respect for the material, the artists, and the owners. It was also important to demonstrate to funders that the concept of the Cultural Recovery Center was sound. It would undoubtedly have been more cost-effective to ship materials to fully-equipped con-servation laboratories and storage facilities in the U.S., but it was clearly important that Haiti' s cultural heritage remain accessible to the Haitian people, particularly during such a time of crisis and loss. Working in partnership had its costs\u2014in control over the work as well as in public visibility. However, the partnerships al- lowed us all to get \"boots on the ground\" much more ef - ciently and effectively than if we had worked alone. 71 THE CENTER TAKES SHAPE IN PORT-AU-PRINCE NOT FOR SALE OR REPRODUCTIONCori Wegener (left) and Mike Bellamy (back to camera) visit numerous sites including the badly damaged home of historian Georges Corvington, whose famed collection of rare books was temporarily stored in a sea container. Photo by Patrick VilaireSEEKING A CULTURAL RECOVERY BASE CORINE WEGENER In late March 2010, I returned to Haiti with Mike Bellamy, the Smithsonian Institution's Director of Engineering and Construction. Our mission was to make the nal site selec- tion for the Haiti Cultural Recovery Center. We looked at the Haiti Habitat site Richard Kurin and I had seen on our first trip as well as Camp Dragon, the JTF Command Center adjacent to the U.S Embassy where we'd met General Keen. But we really had set our sights on the U.S. military logistical base at Toussaint Louverture International Airport. It gave us size, ease of access, and plenty of security. Given discussions between the Smithsonian, the President's Committee, and the State Department, orders had been is-sued. The military was in agreement and the site was ready to go, complete with tents, generators, showers, and other facilities, all within a well-fenced area. It was perfect! Unfortunately, the next day we learned that the U.S. mili-tary mission in Haiti had been extended. General Keen would need to keep his sites and equipment for several additional months. Day two of our mission and we were back to the drawing board! 72 THE CENTER TAKES SHAPE IN PORT-AU-PRINCE NOT FOR SALE OR REPRODUCTIONNOT FOR SALE OR REPRODUCTIONIn May, I was back in Haiti to formally sign our agreement with the Ministry of Culture and Communication. Marie-Laurence Lass\u00e8gue and I had not known each other before the development of the project, but had now developed a healthy mutual respect and appreciation, and she was able to cut through a lot of bureaucracy that threatened to hold us back. I met with President and Mrs. Pr\u00e9val at their home to update them on the project. And with Olsen and Patrick Delatour, was able to examine the building being readied to become the Cultural Recovery Center. At the Smithsonian we put formal agreements in place with both AIC and ICCROM and arranged ini-tial funding using The Broadway League donation. AIC conservators were deployed to Haiti to help do site and collections assessments, and build trust among cultural institutions. ICCROM specialists Aparna Tandon and Baba Keita joined them to scope out training require-ments and strategies, so we could be ready once we were established. With FOKAL, we'd developed an agreement for them to be our fiscal agent in Haiti. We now had a pipeline for the transfer of funds and for the Center's needed procurement of goods and services. The President's Committee continued to be a cru- cial partner. With its help and advocacy, two million dollars were included in the State Department's request for a supplemental appropriation from Congress for overall Haitian relief. Not having the funds yet in hand to apply to the project's costs, the Smithsonian advanced the funds with the approval and support of Secretary Clough and our mission-enabling Under Secretary for Finance and Administration, Alison McNally. We planned a trip to Haiti in early July to be led by the Secretary and to include members of the President's Committee, The Broadway League, and oth-ers, so they too could visit the cultural sites and collec-tions, see the Cultural Recovery Center in operation, meet with Haitian cultural colleagues, and appreciate what their efforts had made possible. We were hoping to be able to show progress at the Center. Olsen, working with our landlord Samir Handal, had readied the facility. Stephanie, Cori, Hugh, Vicki, and others had set up the conservation studios. Olsen had a Haitian support staff in place. Working with FOKAL's Lorraine Mangon\u00e8s, and Fiscal Of cer Vanessa Goscinny, funds were in place to pay for salaries and operations. Joseph Jean Baptiste Mentor, the Of ce Manager, had rented vehicles, procured hotel rooms for visiting conservators, and made other arrangements. We produced a brochure in English, French, and Krey\u00f2l describing the work the Center would do, and distrib-uted it broadly to cultural institutions in Haiti. Now, all we needed were items to treat and conserve. WORK BEGINS AT THE CULTURAL RECOVERY CENTER The first objects came in from Georges Nader\u2014 five paintings, two by Haitian master artist Hector Hyppolite. The Smithsonian's Gail Joice from the National Museum of the American Indian working with Center Registrar Carmelita Douby, registered the items and obtained permission to treat them. Working over the weekend and up to the time he fl ew out of Port-au-Prince, AIC Conservator Hitoshi painting Un Beau R\u00eave by Celestin Faustin. These items were closely followed with objects from the Sugar Cane Museum\u2014a damaged Taino artifact restored by Hugh Shockey and an eighteenth century document relating to the battle plans of Haitian revo-lutionary leader Alexandre P\u00e9tion treated by Vicki Lee. In July, Margo Lion, Vice-Chair Mary Schmidt Campbell, Ricky Arriola, Pamela Joyner, Olivia Morgan, Ken Solomon, Marsha Semmel, Rachel Goslins, and staffer Traci Slater-Rigaud of the President's Committee, Chair Paul Libin, Past-Chair Nina Lannan, and Executive Director Charlotte St. Martin of The Broadway League, as well as Bill Hillman of the Affirmation Arts Fund, along with Secretary Clough and me, traveled to Haiti. Visiting the sites of the National Cathedral, Holy Trinity Episcopal Cathedral, the Centre d'Art, and the Nader Museum, they were struck by the devastation. Though amidst the overwhelming rubble and refugee camps, all were buoyed by the sounds of music coming from exuberant students at the remains of the Holy Trinity Cathedral as the children practiced for a concert. Culture clearly was alive and vibrant in the young. The group was hosted by President and Mrs. Pr\u00e9val at their temporary home. All of our partners, stake-holders, staff, and conservators attended, along with U.S. Ambassador Ken Mertens and others. Again, it was way way off Broadway, but the delegation was happy to watch a performance by a Haitian youth group. The next day, the group toured the Center to examine treatments in progress and discuss them with Stephanie Hornbeck, David Goist, Beverly Perkins, and Karen Pavelka. We had an instructive meeting with Haitian cultural leaders and supporters including Patrick Delatour, Mich\u00e8le Pierre-Louis, Lorraine Mangon\u00e8s, David Cesar, and many others. It was a ne opportunity to review the Cultural Recovery Project's assumptions, strategies and goals. We were now rmly up and running.

I felt well equipped for the task given my prior professional experience as a civil engineer with the Naval Facilities Engineering Command (NAVFAC) in the Caribbean Region, and was acutely aware of the sig-ni cant logistical challenges we were certain to face in the wake of the earthquake. Shortly after our initial discussion, and at Richard's request, I attended a seminar at the University of Miami which focused on the scienti c and engineering aspects of Haiti's reconstruction. At that event, I had the good fortune to meet Professor Reginald DesRoches, a Haitian-American and Associate Chair of the School of Civil and Environmental Engineering at the Georgia Institute of Technology, who was actively working in Haiti. The insights he shared with me at the seminar, and at a subsequent meeting in Washington, D.C., provided a valuable technical overview of the prevailing structural conditions in Port-au-Prince. In Port-au-Prince, when initial plans to use the U.S. Southern Command's Joint Task Force Haiti base at the airport fell through, Cori Wegener and I sought other options. Our military liaison, LTC Sovie, sent us to Robert Taylor, a NAVFAC Realty Specialist. He in turn recom-mended that we visit the former United Nations Development Program (UNDP) compound in the Bourdon area of Port-au-Prince. The three buildings in this compound had been built to a higher standard as compared to other facilities in Haiti and had withstood the earthquake with relatively minor damage. The site met our needs and we selected the site and one of the buildings for the Cultural Heritage Recovery Center, pending a comprehensive technical inspection and structural analysis. For this purpose, I assembled and led a cross-functional technical team for the inspec- tion comprised of the following individuals from the Smithsonian's Of ces of Planning and Project Management, and Engineering, Design and Construction, and Occupational Safety Health and Environmental Management: Ed Rynne (Associate Director for Real Estate), Evi Oehler (Architect), Ramy Bindra (Mechanical Engineer), Hung Nguyen (Electrical Engineer), and Mark Wright (Fire Protection Engineer). The team traveled to Haiti during the rst week of May. My Administrative Assistant, Veronica Shaw, provided critical support during the entire initiative. After an intensive week long review of the former UNDP compound by the team, in coordina- tion with NAVFAC's Taylor and structural engineer Bobby G. Grissett, we were able to ensure that the Cultural Heritage Recovery Center would be housed in a safe, secure, and fully func-tional facility, and be ready for occupancy.

Leasing a building in post-earthquake Haiti, which was both structurally safe and functionally useful, had its particular and unique challenges, given the widespread devastation we found in Port-au-Prince. Prior to traveling to Port-au-Prince, I held detailed discussions with senior of cials within the Department of State's Overseas Building Operations Group and the Department of Homeland Security, as well as a Naval Facilities Command Realty Specialist posted to Haiti, to develop a lease document appropriate for this international initiative. Once we determined that the building and compound met our technical needs and speci ca- tions, we had to negotiate a lease agreement with the owner of the property, Samir Handal, a builder and businessman active in Haiti for over twenty years. Also, we had to discuss and arrange for needed security enhancements, such as barbed wire and security bars on windows, given that the building would house Haiti's national cultural treasures. Having Smithsonian and AIC conservators present during the technical review gave me a better idea of other modi- cations needed for the labs and studios. Interior climate control was a critically important issue, as the public power available was both intermittent and unpredictable, and therefore inherently unreliable. Since the building was served by aged generators, we arranged for Samir to provide new ones\u2014which only weeks later he was able to ship in from Canada. The nal negotiation of the lease agreement occurred during a series of lengthy discussions with Samir over a three day period, and included provisions for providing furniture, utilities, and compound security. We negotiated a xed monthly payment for rent and the use of two generators, and xed rates for furniture and security. These costs totaled about $23,000 a month. We agreed to pay for fuel by amount used, and estimated this would amount to about $14,000 a month. Since Richard Kurin had a very limited amount of funding in place at the outset of the project, I structured the terms of the lease agreement accordingly to give us the needed fl exibility, and had it in place so that we could open our doors at the beginning of June.

Should we have a central place or should we improve the physical conditions of existing buildings at dif-ferent cultural institutions? We opted for a central place for at least two reasons. First, many of the buildings were very badly damaged by the earthquake and second, we urgently needed a project operational center to focus on the artworks and create the minimal conditions for coordination of recovery activities, conservation treatment, training, and storage. The Haiti Cultural Recovery Center (HCRC)\u2014Centre de Sauvetage de Biens Culturels as it is known to Haitians, took de nite shape when the former United Nations Development Program (UNDP) headquarters building was identi ed in Bourdon. Structural engineers who visited this building after the earthquake agreed that it was one of the best facilities available in Port-au-Prince. On May 4, I started working with a team of architects, structural and mechanical engineers, conservators, curators, security consultants, and managers to perform a deep inspection of every aspect of the space. We found a structurally sound building of 700 square meters and about a 1,000 square meter walled and gated courtyard. During four working days envisioning the best possible use of the available facility, we gured out a way to accommodate storage spaces, of ces, classrooms for training, and three basic conservation treatment studios for paintings, objects, and works on paper. On their report, the team also recommended many basic improvements for the electrical, hydraulic, re safety, security, and air conditioning systems. The owner of the facility, Samir Handal, agreed to implement the recommended improvements and the lease agreement was signed. As early as the rst week of June, we needed to hire the Cultural Recovery Center staff in order to organize the work with all the project's partners and to perform, as a team, a series of important tasks. I started to hire a basic team of people including an administrative assistant, an of ce manager, a registrar, a training coordinator, two drivers, and three housekeepers. The Smithsonian also contracted with Stephanie Hornbeck to be the Chief Conservator to oversee the conservation activities and organize the participation of conservators coming from the Smithsonian, and the American Institute for Conservation. We turned our attention to the cultural rescue and recovery of materials from cultural sites and collections. To do this we had to involve and utilize Haitian, American, and international experts and secure the goods and services necessary for the viability of the project. In man-aging the HCRC we needed to keep complete and accurate scal records of our purchases of materials and services. But operating after the earthquake was dif cult in Port-au-Prince. We had trouble nding vehicles to rent, let alone to buy. We developed good relations with the few hotels that were open to house people, and eventually spent six months to nd a house for the visiting international conservators. We needed good shelving\u2014but nothing was for sale\u2014so we had it specially built. Nonetheless, with the initial team in place we were able to organize, and on June 1, I was able to say that the Haiti Cultural Recovery Center was open for business. Georges Nader and Olsen Jean Julien look over scores of damaged paintings. Photo by Corine WegenerThe help offered by the Smithsonian could not have come at a better time. In March, a group from the Institution travelled to Haiti and visited the site where the remaining of the Museum stood. This visit was followed by an offer to restore some of our masterpieces including two paintings from Hector Hyppolite, one of Haiti's most renowned artists, dating from the 1940s. The role played by the Smithsonian in restoring key paintings was indispensable as these speci cally required expertise and materials that, unfortunately, were lacking in Haiti. \u2014Georges Nader, Jr. 79 THE CENTER TAKES SHAPE IN PORT-AU-PRINCE NOT FOR SALE OR REPRODUCTIONNOT FOR SALE OR REPRODUCTIONASSESSING THE PRESSING NEEDS OF HAITI'S COLLECTIONS SUSAN S. BLAKNEY After hearing the plight of Haiti, as a paintings conservator, I was on pins and needles for months, longing to be deployed due to my training as an AIC CERT responder. By May 4, I found myself en route to Port-au-Prince with a team of engi- neers and two other specialist conservators, Hugh Shockey and Vicki Lee, to determine the extent of damaged cultural collections, and access a building deemed suitable for the Cultural Recovery Center. The magnitude of devastation I witnessed in the ve days I spent in Haiti was overwhelming by comparison to my expe- rience on the Mississippi Gulf Coast and Galveston, Texas after our nation's massive disasters. Our initial meeting with Haitian of cials drove home the need to tell the world their patrimony was not lost, and their future livelihood which hung in the balance also depended on saving their cherished collections of art and artifacts. They were a nation of artists whose work not only recorded their struggle for independence but were a major factor in employment and tourism driving the nation's economic engine. With Olsen Jean Julien and Corine Wegener as our guides we spent our days visiting a dozen important collections. Criss-crossing the city in two vehicles, weaving our way through massive piles of rubble and debris, we witnessed people camping out and conducting business for survival on every available nook and cranny. You could see numerous tent cit-ies, thousands of make-shift shelters, workers scavenging debris, roadside vendors offering hot and cold food, as well as necessities, and art hanging on walls for sale. Crowds forever waiting in line were around every corner. Their love of art was evident in murals and colorful bus transports\u2014\"tap-taps\"\u2014of every size and shape traversing the streets as the busi-ness of survival was in full gear. Schools were reopening and mothers beamed with pride, escorting colorfully dressed children in unbelievable spotlessly clean and pressed uniforms. The staff of every collection we visited had made heroic efforts to save their collections. With few available supplies, they rapidly rescued and stored what they could to await future treatments. Our advice was eagerly sought and needed because there was no history of preservation in the country. In thirty- ve years of practice, I saw more damaged art than ever before. In one collection of over 12,000 paintings\u2014that of the Nader Museum, stacks of seventy- ve to hundreds of paintings removed from their broken stretchers were piled high like pancakes. Although concrete dust covered every surface, and while paint was fl aking due to impact damage, and canvases torn and solid supports in fragments, I knew they could be brought back to exhibition condition. I fell in love with Haitians' colorful creations laced with a m\u00e9lange of social history, Vodou traditions, and Christianity. Upon returning home we three wrote lengthy reports summarizing our ndings and recommendations for each collec- tion's pressing needs. The suggested recovery center building met our dreams and we made recommendations for its layout, suggested equipment, and materials. My experience of Haiti is forever burned into my memory. Haitian art is a national treasure, and we must continue to help them save it.

Photo courtesy of Corine Wegener NOT FOR SALE OR REPRODUCTIONRESCUING ART FROM THE RUBBLE OF THE QUAKE KATE TAYLOR PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti\u2014Susan Blakney, a paintings con- servator from New York, scrambled up a mound of rubble left by the collapse of the Episcopal Holy Trinity Cathedral here, searching for small shards of the cathedral's murals. The cathedral is a cherished part of this country's cul- tural heritage and most of its murals were destroyed in the earthquake that struck here in January. Two from the north transept, though, one depicting the Last Supper and the other the baptism of Christ, remain largely intact. \"It looks like there are some chunks underneath here,\" Ms. Blakney, 62, yelled to colleagues working with her last Thursday in an effort to save thousands of works of art damaged in the quake. The rescue is being organized by the Smithsonian Institution, which is to open a center here in June where American conservators will work side-by-side with Haitian staff members to repair torn paintings, shattered sculp-tures and other works pulled from the rubble of museums and churches. Haitian artists and cultural professionals have been conducting informal salvage operations for the past four months. But the Americans are bringing conservation ex-pertise \u2014 there are few if any professionally trained art conservators in Haiti \u2014 and special equipment, much of it paid for by private money. The initiative, in its swiftness, its close collaboration with a foreign government and its combination of private and government financing, represents a new model of American cultural diplomacy, one that organizers believe stands in stark contrast to the apathy Americans were accused of exhibiting during the looting of Iraqi artistic treasures in 2003. \"Mistakes have been made in the past, in times of great tragedy or upheaval, by not protecting and prioritizing a country's cultural heritage,\" said Rachel Goslins, the ex-ecutive director of the President's Committee on the Arts and the Humanities, which has been involved in nding money for the project. \"I think this is a huge opportunity for us to say, 'We get it. ' \" The initial nancing is coming from three federal agen- cies and the Broadway League, the trade group for theater owners and producers. Smithsonian of cials say the project will cost $2 million to $3 million over the next year and a half, after which the center is expected to be turned over to the Haitian government. Ms. Blakney traveled here last week with two other conservators, a museum curator, and a group of engi-neers and planning experts from the Smithsonian. The conservators' task was to assess precisely what kinds of damage the art had sustained, not just from the earth-quake but from subsequent exposure to rain and sun and from improper storage both before and after the quake. Based on that information, they will decide what special-ized equipment that they, or whoever the Smithsonian ends up sending to work at the center, will need. Restoring the most compromised art will not be a job for beginners. If the Episcopal Church decides to save the surviving murals from Holy Trinity, which were painted in the early 1950s by some of Haiti's most famous artists, they will probably need to be removed from the damaged building \u2014 a feat of engineering as much as conservation that would involve gluing a piece of fabric to the face of each mural and attaching the mural to a secondary sup-port structure of plywood or steel before chiseling it away from the wall. In her search through the rubble, Ms. Blakney found some small pieces of painted concrete that have now been brought to the Smithsonian for an analysis that will help to determine the right adhesive to use. The American conservators will spend part of their time training Haitians in conservation, in preparation for turn-ing the laboratory over to them. The rescue operation came together largely because of the efforts of Corine Wegener, a curator at the Minneapolis Institute of Arts and a retired Army major who served in Iraq shortly after the looting of the Iraqi National Museum, and Richard Kurin, the under secretary for history, art and culture at the Smithsonian Institution. Three weeks after the earthquake, Ms. Wegener convened a meeting of art professionals and State Department of cials in Washington about how to provide cultural assistance, and invited Mr. Kurin, who already had ties to Haiti from organizing pro-grams on Haitian art and culture for the Smithsonian's Folklife Festival in 2004. Ms. Wegener, who also made the trip last week, said she had been horrified by what had happened at the Iraqi National Museum, where she worked as a liaison between staff members and American of cials during her deployment. \"It was so disturbing for me as a museum professional to see the staff so completely in shock,\" she said. \"How would I feel if I came to work one day and found 15,000 objects had been looted?\" She was determined not to see history repeat itself in Haiti, she said, and believed that the sooner conservators arrived on the ground, the more artworks could be saved. Mr. Kurin conveyed the need for help to Ms. Goslins of 82 THE CENTER TAKES SHAPE IN PORT-AU-PRINCE NOT FOR SALE OR REPRODUCTIONthe President's Committee on the Arts and the Humanities, a group that includes the heads of the National Endowment for the Arts, the National Endowment for the Humanities and the Institute of Museum and Library Services, as well as well-connected art patrons like the Broadway producer Margo Lion, who is a co-chairman of the committee. The three agencies ended up committing $30,000 each, while the Broadway League, of which Ms. Lion is a member, contributed $276,000. As for the rest of the money that's needed, Ms. Goslins expressed con dence that it would materialize once the center was operating. \"We've been having conversations with both the federal and the private sector about further support,\" Ms. Goslins said, \"and I'm optimistic that once we get through the ini-tial urgent phase of getting this up and running, we'll be able to see the project through.\" The conservators and Ms. Wegener spent four days here, visiting museums, churches and libraries, accompa-nied by Olsen Jean Julien, a former minister of culture and communication, who is acting as an intermediary between the Smithsonian and the Haitian government. They visited the ruins of the Mus\u00e9e d'Art Nader, a pri- vate museum that before the earthquake housed 12,000 paintings and sculptures by 20th-century Haitian mas-ters like Hector Hyppolite and Pr\u00e9f\u00e8te Duffaut, thousands of which were either destroyed or badly damaged when the museum collapsed. They also saw what was left of the Centre d'Art, a workshop where many of those artists trained in the 1940s and 1950s, which also collapsed. In the weeks after the earthquake, volunteers pulled thou-sands of paintings from the wreckage, which were stashed inside two storage containers parked in the sun in front of the ruined building. Some of the Haitian of cials and cultural professionals with whom the group met were hearing about the conser-vation center for the rst time, and responded with relief and many questions, like when it would be open and how much money was being set aside. The American aid is \"fundamental for us,\" said Patrick Vilaire, a sculptor, who took the lead in saving the col-lections of several damaged libraries after the earthquake. A few, however, expressed frustration that aid had not come sooner and a worry that foreign experts were better at conducting visits and assessments than providing real, practical help. At a meeting with Daniel Elie, the head of the gov- ernment agency in charge of preserving Haiti's national heritage, the discussion in front of the plywood shack from which he and his staff have operated since January turned momentarily tense when his colleague and translator, Monique Rocourt, said she was fed up with hosting visit-ing advisers who came and did nothing. \"If I bring another team of experts to Jacmel,\" she said, referring to a city in southern Haiti that was seriously damaged in the quake, \"we will look in front of the popula-tion like we're just bringing foreigners to look at disasters. It's cynical, but that's what people will think.\" Ms. Wegener is sensitive to such concerns, she said on another occasion. She noted that this was her third trip to Haiti since the earthquake. \"We're showing a constant presence,\" she said, \"and now we're bringing people who are specialists.\" At the same time, Ms. Wegener and her colleagues ap- peared anxious not to seem like cultural imperialists, fre-quently repeating that they wanted to know rst what the Haitians wanted to do. Occasionally, their efforts clearly seemed like overkill to some of the people they encountered. When Ms. Wegener suggested to two members of a foundation that supports Vodou art that they write a proposal outlining what the Americans could do to help, one of the two practically rolled her eyes. \"Everyone is coming here and asking us for a proposal,\" the woman, Rachel Beauvoir-Dominique, said. \"You write us a proposal.\" Ms. Wegener, anxious to explain, said that they did not want to create the impression \"that we're telling you what you want.\" \"Don't worry about that,\" Ms. Beauvoir-Dominique's husband, Didier Dominique, interrupted, adding with a smile, \"We know what we want.\" Reprinted from the New York Times, May 10, 2010 83 THE CENTER TAKES SHAPE IN PORT-AU-PRINCE NOT FOR SALE OR REPRODUCTIONFROM BUILDING TO RECOVERY CENTER CORINE WEGENER Leasing the former UNDP building for the Cultural Recovery Center was a big step and meant that our plans could move forward. The three-story building was relative- ly undamaged by the earthquake. With modern electrical systems, plumbing, and central air-conditioning, all within a secure compound on the outskirts of Port-au-Prince, it was perfect. Working with Olsen Jean Julien, I, and Mike Bellamy, along with his team and a small group of AIC and Smithsonian conservators, took on the task of planning the transfor-mation of our empty building into the Cultural Recovery Center (CRC), complete with offices, laboratories, and classroom space. The rest of May, Richard Kurin was busy raising funds and hiring staff while I worked with the American Institute for Conservation on setting up a volunteer conservator rotation system. We needed French speakers if possible, and lots of paintings conservators. We also needed a registrar. Endless details such as liability, health insurance, and security had to be hammered out. In late May, the first group of conservators from AIC and the Smithsonian met me at conservator Stephanie Hornbeck's apartment in Miami, the staging area for all of our conservation supplies. After packing three large duffl e bags each, plus new laptop computers, we headed for the airport. That arrival in Port-au-Prince with conservators and mountains of baggage in tow remains one of my best memories. What had seemed impossible during that February meeting in Washington, D.C., was finally a reality \u2014the Haiti Cultural Recovery Center opened for business on June 1!SUPPLYING THE CENTER ERIC POURCHOT Early conservation work at the Haiti Cultural Recovery Center by American Institute for Conservation (AIC) volunteers was a frustrating and sometimes near-comical endeavor. Paintings conservator David Goist fashioned a makeshift hammer out of a piece of pipe. Book and paper conser-vator Karen Pavelka used an upside-down credenza as a book press. Because fl ammable liquids cannot be carried on airlines, beauty salons in Port-au-Prince were scoured for supplies of acetone\u2014a solvent used in conservation work that is also used to remove nail polish. Work was initially slow and hampered by lack of equipment and supplies. Storage containers secured thousands of works of art from loss and further mechanical damage, but also created hot and humid conditions that would inevitably lead to mold. The clock was ticking. With each group of volunteers, however, additional sup- plies and equipment were brought in\u2014checked or carried as luggage. One conservator brought a sixty-inch long roll of lining cloth in a duffl e bag. Another carried a HEPA vacuum cleaner. Hundreds of respirator masks padded a box of glass jars. Richard Kurin tucked a microscope into his carry-on bag. Conservators also carried a lot of what some might call \"suspicious white powders\"\u2014adhesives, abrasives, micro-balloons used to ll missing areas, waxes, and cleansers\u2014but product descriptions were enclosed and everything arrived safely in Haiti. 84 THE CENTER TAKES SHAPE IN PORT-AU-PRINCE NOT FOR SALE OR REPRODUCTION[Right] Conservators packed supplies for the Cultural Recovery Center in their luggage.

H. (HUGH) SHOCKEY, JR. The short time between the rst exploratory trip and my second trip to begin operations at the Cultural Recovery Center was frantic. Lists of needed supplies and equipment were created by conservators who participated in the rst visit. A por-tion of my days were spent trying to nd a French-speaking registrar to help establish a cataloging system for the works expected from cultural collections. It was also necessary to nd a French-speaking chief conservator who could de ne and organize the technical work and oversee the labs and personnel in Haiti on an ongoing, daily basis. By good fortune, I found a colleague, Gail Joice, at the National Museum of the American Indian. Gail speaks French and had experience establishing registration systems for Native American community museums\u2014a great t for our needs in Haiti. She was more than willing to go to Haiti and help initiate the registration system. The chief conservator role was absolutely crucial\u2014and in planning meetings we realized that we needed someone with the technical expertise who would live and work in Haiti, providing continuity for the Center's conservation program. Conservation colleague Carol Grissom from the Museum Conservation Institute referred Stephanie Hornbeck, a recently retired conservator from the National Museum of African Art, who expressed interest in the project. After speaking with Stephanie about the potential scope of the project and extent of damage we had observed, I encouraged her to contact Richard Kurin about wanting to help. Her experience at the Smithsonian and the fact that she is fl uent in French and is knowledgeable with regard to Haitian art made her an ideal candidate for chief conservator. The rest of May was lled with long days compiling lists of and sourcing supplies, making logistical plans for returning to Haiti, answering queries from colleagues and the public, all in addition to carrying out my duties as a conservator at the Smithsonian American Art Museum. As that manic month closed, the Smithsonian and AIC were furiously buying supplies and equipment and shipping pur- chases to Stephanie's home in Miami where Cori Wegener, AIC conservators Vicki Lee and Hitoshi Kimura, and I would meet up to re-pack it for the fl ight to Port-au-Prince. Cori had pointed out that bringing it in as part of our luggage was much more dependable than trying to ship it in separately given the backlog and snafus in the international supply line. The rst challenge to this plan came at the airport with airline agents telling us we could only take two checked bags\u2014we all had three, Cori successfully convinced them to make an exemption for us. On arrival in Port-au-Prince we were met by Olsen Jean Julien, the Center Manager, who expedited us through immigra- tion and customs, and had us off to the Center with the supplies in short order. The rst days found us anxious to begin working on cultural objects. At the same time, colleagues from ICCROM arrived to start exploring with Olsen, the conservation team, and various stakeholders the most effective way to do training.Our time was spent readying the Center to receive objects, organizing supplies, creating survey forms, and identifying locally available supplies. After her arrival, Gail Joice quickly established a registration system and the Center was ready to receive objects. Days later we took in the rst objects\u2014Haitian paintings followed by revolutionary war era documents and Taino sculp- tures. I shared my elation through a posting on Facebook. Assembling a small broken Taino gurine gave me great sat- isfaction because for me treating the object was not just about mending it and making it whole but also about showing the custodians of the collections we had visited that we were in Haiti not with empty promises but to do good work and to help them recover their heritage. The Sugar Cane Museum asked the Cultural Recovery Center to restore a Taino sculpture damaged during the earthquake. Photos courtesy of L. H.

LEE I was asked to go to Haiti by the American Institute of Conservation (AIC) because I am a member of the AIC Collections Emergency Response Team (CERT) and had previously been deployed to assist in emergencies. I first went to Haiti with the large team to evaluate a suitable location for the Recovery Center. We spent the week driving from museums to libraries and meeting the many stakeholders within the Haitian arts community. It was a week lled with beautiful art work, horrible destruction, and incredible people. We found a building that would provide space for conservation and storage, and we began to think of what would be needed not only to stabilize and treat damaged pieces but also promote training in conservation so the project could continue beyond the immediate future. The second trip was just a few weeks later with Cori Wegener and fellow conservators Hugh Shockey and Hitoshi Kimura. Between me, Hugh, and Hitoshi, we covered the conservation of paper/books, objects, and paintings. We carried in the supplies we thought would be most useful and hardest to obtain in Haiti. Once we arrived we set up our respective labs and made several trips out into the community to nd and log where supplies for the labs might be found locally. We also met with instructors from ICCROM who were developing a teaching plan to train local museum, library, and archives staff about emergency recovery, stabilization, and storage of their materials. When we received the rst pieces into the Cultural Recovery Center\u2014 ve paintings, ve ob- jects, and one document, it was so exciting; it seemed like the project was really going to work! The document I treated came from the Sugar Cane museum. It concerned the orders of General P\u00e9tion, one of Haiti's revolutionary leaders of the late eighteenth and early nine- teenth centuries. Because we had only one paper piece, albeit an important one, I was given the opportunity (and instruction) to vacuum two of the paintings, thus becoming an unof cial paintings conservator as well. After Hugh, Hitoshi, and Cori left I stayed on a third week and the Center received four books to treat. Paintings conservator, Nick Dorman, arrived and together we discussed possible treat- ments for two Hector Hyppolite paintings on cardboard we'd received from the Nader Museum collection. As a book conservator you see a lot of broken cardboard but none of it is painted. The collaboration with other professionals in my eld but not in my specialty was one of the unexpected pleasures of this deployment.I left Haiti with much sadness, unsure if I'd be able to return again. I kept in touch with staff at the CRC and made sure that people with AIC knew that I would return if asked\u2014which one year later I did, with much joy! Vicki L.

I believed in Richard Kurin's vision for the project and graduate study of Haitian art had instilled a strong appreciation for the visual culture here. Yet, the scope of damage was so daunting, it would take months to begin to comprehend the situation. Participating in a multi-national effort added a layer of cultural complexity that presented challenges, involving differ-ences in work approaches and professional interactions. The unknown variables were numerous; these were magni ed by the enormity of the catastrophe, and absence of any existing local preservation infrastructure. While Haiti is distinguished by an internationally-recognized, long history of creativity in the visual arts, a systematic professional commitment to historic preservation and conservation of its cultural patrimony does not exist. Thus, the ability of its art professionals to adequately respond to the severe damage from the earthquake was inherently limited. The critical need to recover the nation's cultural patrimony also presented an opportunity to formally introduce Haitian art professionals to current preservation principles and practices. An important early decision in the project's framework determined that conservation work would happen in Haiti. A corollary decision involves incorporating Haitian professionals into conservation activities at every possible opportunity. The dual objectives of establishing a local facility and training local professionals were developed with a sustainable future in mind, given the eighteen-month project trajectory agreed to by the Smithsonian and the Haitian government at the outset of the project. I thought deeply about formulating a global conservation strategy that was appropriate to a situation which had no historical conservation precedent. My rst task on the job was to review the assessments conducted by Corine Wegener and conservators Susan Blakney, Vicki Lee, and Hugh Shockey, in the spring of 2010. The framework of the project's con-servation objectives would have to be comprehensive, and include: \u0081 The establishment of multiple, specialized conservation studios; \u0081 Staf ng the studios with professional conservators; \u0081 the studios with equipment and conservation-grade materials supplies; \u0081 Assessing damaged collections; \u0081 I care methods and facilities at partnering institutions; \u0081 Providing oversight for large, multi-phase projects;\u0081 Stabilizing large volumes of works with structural and surface (dirt and mold) damage; \u0081 Providing training in collection management and rst aid intervention; \u0081 In special cases, treating individual works of art and public monuments in public and private collections, deemed of high cultural value. The establishment of multiple functioning conservation studios required specialized expertise, equipment, and projects. The participation of the American Institute for Conservation (AIC) closely involved Eryl Wentworth, Executive Director, and Eric Pourchot, Institutional Advancement Director. Given their expertise, professional networks, and commitment, AIC was able to provide a continuous stream of volunteer professional conservators to assist with assessment, stabilization, treatment, and training. Conservators worked to retro- t the of ces of our facility to serve as conservation studio and storage spaces. Access to stable archival and conservation grade materials is very limited, and one hundred percent of such supplies must be 90 THE CENTER TAKES SHAPE IN PORT-AU-PRINCE NOT FOR SALE OR REPRODUCTIONimported. The project purchased microscopes, easels, digi- tal cameras, computers, printers, vacuums, fabrics, papers, adhesives, artist supplies, ne hand tools and heavy tools, and personal protective equipment. These would be hand-carried by conservators and other colleagues in more than sixty- ve trips. Pourchot worked closely with me to order supplies throughout the project. A professional staff of dedicated Haitian colleagues was formed to interface with Haitian institutions and to sup-port conservation efforts at the Cultural Recovery Center. At the outset, I joined Olsen Jean Julien, Joseph Jean Baptiste Mentor, Fritz Berg Jeannot, Carmelita Douby, and Missely Michel. As our project was a pioneering effort that we were building along the way, while constrained by a limited timeframe, we did not have the bene t of cultural immersion training to assist in effecting collaboration. The acculturation aspects were signi cant for both Haitians adapting to foreign professionals and routines of conser-vation practice, and for me and other American and foreign conservators understanding and adapting to Haitian norms of interaction and communication. Yet, the importance of the recovery effort and the knowledge that it required both local and foreign expertise uni ed us. Together, we faced an enormous volume of work and had to nd creative ways to launch the project collaboratively.

Olsen Jean Julien looked for an Of ce Manager to run the administrative operations of the Center. I was selected and quickly went to work, mindful of the enormous magnitude of the tasks ahead. We began our activities even before the rst disbursement of funds\u2014we couldn't wait. There were so many challenges to face in launching the cultural rescue operations. I focused on two immediate objectives\u2014recruit a quali ed and compe- tent staff and establish required administrative procedures. Beyond that I coordinated logistics, purchased supplies for the of ce and our conservation laboratories, arranged vehicles for travel and transport, contracted for various services, arranged for hotels and housing, as well as pick-ups to and from the airport of our volunteer conservators. I have been responsible for securing the transfers of incoming funds and for the execution of expenditures. I manage the nancial records of the Center, keeping track of all purchases, and tracking our monthly budgets. I compose our nancial reports to FOKAL and to the Smithsonian. Administrative ef ciency has been our goal\u2014it is indispensable to support our cultural recovery efforts and to meet the expectations of our stakeholders. Achieving this is not without problems, especially in a nation recovering from a disas- ter. We've had to deal with suppliers with little respect to delivery times, hotel rooms mistakenly cancelled, and numer- ous other issues. I have had to constantly listen, explain, discuss, and adjust measures relating to the realization of my responsibilities. Olsen has provided strong direction and has been assisted by a professional and dynamic team. We have seen how much good we can do in a short time when there is determination and commitment. I have learned a lot from working in the Center's multicultural environment and am very proud to be part of this team.

Photo by Stephanie Hornbeck 92 THE CENTER TAKES SHAPE IN PORT-AU-PRINCE NOT FOR SALE OR REPRODUCTIONTHE CENTER'S REGISTRATION PROCESS MAGDALENA CARMELITA DOUBY GUILLAUME Working with Smithsonian registrar Gail Joice, we at the Haiti Cultural Recovery Center (CRC) adapted a comprehensive museum registration procedure to document incoming collections according to their characteristics, and the identity of the cultural institutions that owned them. To initiate the intake and treatment process, the CRC required collection owners to sign permission forms giving the Center formal authorization to work on their collections. The permission forms constitute a formal legal agreement between the Center\u2014as a project of the Smithsonian\u2014and the Haitian cultural institution. The Haiti Cultural Recovery Project designed the forms in such a way as to provide options for 1) the inspection and assessment of collections on a cultural site, 2) work with a cultural collection, and 3) storage of a cultural collection after treatment. That way, Haitian organizations could sign onto activities that t their particular circumstances. The Nader Museum and Gallery was the rst organization to sign, followed by many others. The forms speci ed owner- ship or stewardship, covered issues of legal liability with regard to responsible conservation treatment, and guaranteed that the items would be returned to organizations on demand. In some cases, as with some very complex situations like the Centre d'Art, it took several months of discussions to nally secure permission. Both public and private institutions signed the forms.Once I, as the Registrar, receive the signed permission forms, the CRC informs the institution when it will be ready to start working on site or with a collection. In the case of a collection, each of the objects received from an institution is inventoried. A reception form is lled out, in double original, for each object. One original is given to the institution and the other is stored and led at the CRC. A unique inventory number is assigned to each object. For example, below is the inventory number for a painting from the Centre d'Art. The inventory record provides basic information\u2014object name and description, owner, dimensions, object type, and media. Every object is digitally photographed\u2014front and back. Close-up photographs are made of damaged parts of the object. These images form part of the inventory record. Every item is then technically examined and assessed from a conservation perspective, the results of which are presented in a condition report form. The assessment ascertains the structural condition of the object. This is the basis for the con-servation or stabilization treatment. Condition assessments and reports are designed to be fl exible given the broad range of objects taken into the Center. Conservators review the results of the condition assessments, and then objects are sent to the appropriate laboratory for treatment. The Registrar is the of cial keeper of the Cultural Recovery Center database, and so I have to track the loca- tion of each and every object. Each laboratory has a manual copy of the reports for each object received for conservation treatment. The originals are kept with the Registrar who regularly updates the documentation.Each object treated has an accompanying treatment report, including the images during and after treatment; this report is added to complete the documentation.After the completion of the treatment, arrangements for the return of the object are made with the owner's institution. In some cases, as with very large collections where the storage capacity of the owner is very limited, the CRC stores the objects securely on site in its building or sea containers in the compound\u2014depending upon the need for climate control.

I have been a registrar for over twenty- ve years before coming to the National Museum of the American Indian as Collections Manager in 2003. For the Haiti project I was also asked to consult on the requirements for security and shelving systems for storage of the works that would be coming for treatment at the Center. I was most fortunate to be able to work with the Center's very competent Registrar, Carmelita Douby, who was hired by the Center's Manager, Olsen Jean Julien. Carmelita was an architect with museum experience. We spoke French and English together and formed an immediate bond as we faced the daunting task presented by setting up a collection reg- istration and management system so soon after the devastating earthquake. Our job was de nitely a \"start from square one\" experience! We began with an empty suite of three of ce rooms within the former UNDP compound. These spaces had no furniture at rst, no security bars on the windows and doors and an HVAC system that was in the preliminary testing/start-up phase, not always reliable for controlling temperature and relative humidity. Carmelita installed the software on our Smithsonian-provided collections inventory computer, while the Internet went periodically in and out of service due to continuing post-disaster infrastructure problems. W e consulted together on the best way to set up registration numbering and le systems for the objects that would be coming in from the important museums and private collections that had been severely damaged. Since we needed to respond quickly, our rst system was a simple numbering protocol on Excel spreadsheets. We knew that selecting a museum-quality data management system could come later. We emphasized the importance of making photographic records for all incoming objects. We had to be as creative and practical as possible on the choice of available materials for our work. Carmelita drove us through rubble- lled streets to an art supply store in Petion Ville to look for things like object tags, appropriate marking tools, and plastic supplies. The only plastic they had available at the store was colored cellophane, so we had to look further a eld. A stop at an of ce supply store provided us with the appropriate records le cabinets we would need. However, we knew that the shelving for storing damaged paintings would need to be built quickly with available materials, in this case, simple wooden shelving. We measured out the parameters of the storage room and tried to estimate how many of the thousands of paintings needing attention could be stored there as they waited for conser- vation attention. We worked with Olsen to ensure that the building renovation contractor would put iron security bars on all windows and doors as a high priority before any art entered the building. We also researched what security rms were available in Port-au-Prince to provide preliminary alarm systems to support the night watchmen on site. Before I left Haiti we were able to visit two of the larger collections of objects that had been damaged, the Nader Museum collection of paintings, and the Lehmann collection of Vodou art. I was honored to be able to register, transport, and store the very rst ve paintings that came into the Center for treatment by our AIC volunteer conservator Hitoshi Kimura. I am also proud that so much has been accomplished since then! Gail Joice is the Collections Manager at the National Museum of the American Indian.

It was a similar disaster, the major earthquake in my home- land of Kobe, Japan, in January 1995, which prompted my decision to become a conservator. As a volunteer for the American Institute for Conservation Collections Emergency Response Team (AIC-CERT), I deployed to Haiti in June, car-rying in supplies with the rst group of conservators to work at the Center. In Haiti we spent a lot of time getting the Center in order, meeting people and visiting collections. I visited the Nader Gallery with Olsen Jean Julien where we picked up five important, but badly damaged Haitian paintings. Gail Joice processed the permissions forms and we took the paintings back to the Center. These would be the rst items treated by the project.The next day was a Sunday, and the Center was supposed to be closed. I was scheduled to fly back to the U.S. at mid-day Monday and was determined to use my skills and training to save at least one of the paintings. So Olsen opened the Center and I went to work. I wrote a condition report for three paintings, one by Celestin Faustin and two others by Carlo Jean Jacques. The other two paintings were done by one of Haiti's most im- portant artists, Hector Hyppolite, and I decided that given my limited time, I had better leave it to the next conserva- tor for a fresh start. I then focused on the Faustin painting and went to work. I had brought a solar battery powered radio with me and was able to listen to the inspiring and beautiful sound of a Haitian church choir while working on the painting for the rest of the day and on Monday morning. I had just an hour before heading to the airport to complete the \"in- painting\"\u2014which I did! Hitoshi Kimura is Chief Conservator of Art Conservation of Central Florida in Tampa, Florida.MAKING SHREDS WHOLE DAVID GOIST On July 6, 2010, my AIC-CERT fellow conservators Bev Perkins and Karen Pavelka, and I were invited to join the visiting delegation from the Smithsonian, the U.S. President's Committee on the Arts and the Humanities, and The Broadway League at a reception at the tempo- rary home of Haitian President Ren\u00e9 Pr\u00e9val and First Lady Elisabeth Pr\u00e9val to thank us for our cultural recovery ini-tiative. The event highlighted the contrasts experienced during our deployment. During the day I had been working on paintings salvaged from the Nader Museum in the ne building used as the Haiti Cultural Recovery Center. While the Center was clean and air conditioned, it was still being equipped for conser-vation treatments. I had to scavenge through the rubble around the Center trying to nd a piece of pipe to use as a tack hammer to re-stretch a painting. After work, I had been able to return to the hotel to show- er and put on dress clothes. On the way to the President's reception we drove up a hill through some of the largest camps of displaced people that I had observed during my stay. None of the people in these camps had the luxury of a shower or a comfortable bed. At one point we stopped at the site of the Nader Museum. It was literally in ruins, and I was amazed that any paintings had survived. From the rubble, I picked up a thoroughly shredded painting. As I held it I thought of all the lives lost during the earth- quake. I also thought of my mother who had passed away two days before my departure for Haiti. I knew she would understand why I was there. David Goist is a Conservator of Paintings in Raleigh, North Carolina. [Upper left] AIC Conservator David Goist examines Hector Hyppolite's Calle.

Photo by Corine Wegener NOT FOR SALE OR REPRODUCTIONOTHER DUTIES AS ASSIGNED LESHAWN BURRELL-JONES One of my responsibilities as Richard Kurin's special assistant at the Smithsonian was to make arrangements for various contractors\u2014individual and organizations\u2014to \"get into the Smithsonian system\" so they could get contracts, get paid, and get to Haiti. I've had to liaise with Haitian and U.S. government of cials to make sure things happened as they are supposed to. My job is simply to do what needs to get done. In the Smithsonian, our short-hand term for doing this is \"other duties as assigned.\" As we began the project I had to go to the Haitian Embassy in Washington, D.C., in search of the then Haitian Ambassador and the Haitian Minister of Tourism to get their signatures on a memorandum of understanding (MOU), only to arrive there and nd out that they were having lunch at a nearby restaurant. The Ambassador's driver drove me to the restaurant and that's where the \"formal\" signing of the MOU took place! On another occasion, I hosted the Minister of Culture and Communication for lunch because Richard was unexpectedly called into an urgent Smithsonian meeting. I thought, \"I have to host the Minister\u2014are you kidding me? What will I say?\" I was a bit nervous, but it all worked out. Minister Lass\u00e8gue could not have been more pleasant. Numerous times I've had to make arrangements for entire delegations to get to and from Haiti. When I began working on logistics, Internet connections were non-existent, and when I was able to get through on the telephone, the Haitians of course spoke French. This was a huge language barrier for me! I called upon other Smithsonian staff including Diana N'Diaye in the Center for Folklife and Cultural Heritage, who speaks fl uent French and worked in Haiti, to help me out. From the beginning I did what needed to be done. I've written contracts for conservators from around the world to go to Haiti and lend their expertise to the project. With the assistance of other Smithsonian colleagues, I've managed the deliv-ery of critical conservation supplies. One was particularly adventuresome. Conservators at the CRC needed a suction table, and of course, there is none in Haiti. We put out a call to museums and cultural institutions. The Library of Congress had one they were going to surplus. Arranging the transfer from the Library to the Smithsonian was in itself complicated. We had to store it in a Smithsonian warehouse. Our exhibits people crated it along with other supplies. It was then trucked to Florida and loaded on a freight ship to Haiti. We then contended with Haitian customs authorities and ministries for four months to get it from the port to the Cultural Recovery Center. To be a part of this project has been rewarding. It has humbled me. With the many obstacles that we faced in the begin- ning (and throughout), we could have easily thrown our hands up and said, \"We tried.\" It has given me a sense of what is possible, and, if every person, organization, and/or country does its part, relationships can be forged, respect can be garnered, and unthinkably good things can happen.

Of course, vaulting into such unknown conditions was bewildering, exciting, and worrying. Though things had already been well scoped-out by our colleagues and we made all the necessary preparations, I was only just about comfortable telling my boss and my family that I was con dent that this would be a safe trip. The fact that most of the rest of my fellow passengers on the plane to Haiti were teenagers on their way to build churches was pretty reassuring; although the doubts made a quick come-back with the hellish spectacle of the rst \"displaced persons\" camp directly outside the airport. These doubts weren't lightened much by the comical exclamations of \"Hey, Obama!\" from the kids on the other side of the fence (I do not bear much resemblance to the President). Spending a week at the Cultural Recovery Center documenting, and working on the art, despite the forethought and plan- ning and the behemoth tool-case that I dragged with me, presented many a challenge. There were no solvents except a scrumptious smelling \"ethanol\" and some nail polish remover, and the damage to the paintings bore full, clear testimony to those few violent moments in January. I worked on two Hector Hyppolite paintings\u2014 Calle and Pot de Fleurs\u2014that had been rent into a dozen parts and still bore fragments of stone and rubble as well as the lthy dust that covered every surface. But I was working on paintings, away from the phone and other distractions, cocooned from the city damage in the Recovery Center and enjoying the hospitality of Olsen Jean Julien and his team, and the company of supportive colleagues Vicki Lee and Stephanie Hornbeck. The reality of the circumstances reasserted itself each night as we returned to the hotel through Port-au-Prince's shattered streets in darkness to furious readings of the Book of Revelations in French on Of ce Administrator Joseph Jean Baptiste Mentor's car radio. The experience evoked a terri c range of feelings and thoughts that are dif cult to condense into a few lines but, if I had questions at the start of the week: What sort of emergency response was this? Was I using the right adhesives? Whether it was right to take up a hotel room for art restoration? I was left with no illusions about both the magnitude of the loss of visual patrimony in Port-au-Prince and the essential, vital signi cance of that art to Haiti. And for that realization and the small contribution of a week's worth of work, I was glad.

But when Smithsonian magazine okayed my proposal to assess the impact of the Haitian earthquake on the nation's art community I defied my journalistic instincts . . . and waited. I wasn't sweating the reporting part of this trip. Having traveled to Haiti several times as a journalist and art collector, beginning in the 1970s, I knew many of the key players. I delayed my departure because in the immediate aftermath of this tragedy I did not want to impose on people who were suffering. My patience was rewarded when I arrived in the Caribbean island nation several weeks later after my friends and ac- quaintances in the art community had resolved just enough of their basic problems to lend me a generous hand. Philippe Dodard, one of Haiti's leading contemporary artists, found me a scarce hotel room and made some valuable introductions. Gallery owner Axelle Liautaud arranged meetings with one of Haiti's best known na\u00efve artists, eighty-seven-year-old Pr\u00e9f\u00e8te Duffaut, who was living in a crude tent, as well as Episcopal Bishop Jean-Zach\u00e9 Duracin, who had lost dozens of his churches, including Holy Trinity Cathedral with its famed Haitian-style Biblical murals. Another art dealer, Toni Monnin, introduced me to Frantz Z\u00e9phirin, a gregarious forty-one-year-old painter and Vodou priest who was mourning the deaths of several family members yet busy creating earthquake-themed paintings. No one was more generous with his time and insights than Georges Nader, Jr., a gallery owner whose father was one of the earliest promoters of Haitian art. The elder Nader and his wife were napping in the master bedroom of their house when the earthquake struck. They escaped, just barely, but their house, which doubled as a Haitian art gallery and museum, was a massive pile of rubble. \"I'll take you there so you can see for yourself,\" Georges, Jr. promised, and he did. After nine days in Haiti I was prepared to write about the breathtaking toll the earthquake had taken on the arts community: at least three artists, two gallery owners, and an arts foundation director had died. Thousands of paintings and sculptures\u2014valued in the tens of millions of dollars\u2014were destroyed or badly damaged in museums, galleries, churches, collectors' homes, government ministries, and the National Palace. The Haitian Art Museum at College St. Pierre was in rough shape, and the storied Centre d'Art\u2014a charming wooden house where I had bought many paintings, Vodou fl ags, and iron sculptures over the years\u2014had crumbled. Yet, for all this misery and destruction, there was optimism. Like Z\u00e9phirin, Duffaut was creating \"earthquake art,\" and he beamed while showing me a painting he named The Star of Haiti. \"You see, I want all of my paintings to send a message,\" Duffaut said, standing outside his tent. \"My message is simple. Haiti will be back.\" On the fl ight home, I gazed out upon Haiti's rugged, deforested landscape and thought about a local proverb that summed things up. Deye mon, gen mon, the Krey\u00f2l saying goes. \"Beyond the mountains, more mountains.\" For Haiti's art community, the climb is already underway, I thought. No doubt there will be challenges as the journey to recovery continues. But beyond the next mountain, opportunities surely will be waiting.

David Cesar was meeting on the third fl oor in their recently renovated of ces. The practice of Les Petits Chanteurs had just nished with most of the students out of the building. Various teachers were conducting their lessons with individual students. The Trade School located in the same facility was just beginning their late afternoon classes. The Holy Trinity Episcopal Cathedral, which included the world-renowned Haitian-style Biblical murals, the Concert Hall of the National Philharmonic Orchestra, the Music School with 1,000 students, the Trade School with 1,200 students and the Elementary School with 1,500 students, was alive and well with the sound of music heard throughout the campus. The earthquake hit and the chaos began. Most of the administrators were able to get to the ground level\u2014the director of discipline was killed\u2014the trumpet instruc- tor, the voice instructor, and several people were dug out and rescued. The Concert Hall located on the fl oor above part of the Trade School came crashing down trapping and killing over two hundred and fty of their students beneath\u2014the leading alto of Les Petits Chanteurs on his way to his birthday party was killed as were ve others at different locations. Pere David and the leaders, in spite of their grief and shock, gathered and began the process of locating the survivors and digging out to preserve as many of the instruments and supplies as possible. They then decided to immediately offer their music to the people to restore hope. Mini-concerts covered by CNN and NBC were organized and held throughout the tent cities of Port-au-Prince. A national service to honor the dead and give hope was given with the orchestra participating. Using wood and tarps, spaces were created to restart classes, rehearsals, and individual instruction. The sound of music was heard again throughout the totally destroyed campus and beyond. Pere David called me and said they wished to go forward with the annual fall United States Tour. I suggested perhaps postponing, but he was insistent. They wanted to say thank you to the people of the United States and to continue to show a positive image of Haiti by offering the restoration of hope through their music. We then arranged the Tour to begin in Atlanta and end in Maine with over fty performances in twenty-seven days in twenty-four cities. Knowing of the work the Smithsonian was doing with the Cathedral murals, I called Richard Kurin of the Smithsonian and said that we would be in Washington and \"What about a concert at one of the museums?\" Without hesitation he said they would love to host a concert. The staff of the Smithsonian went to work and Les Petits Chanteurs and the Chamber Ensemble travelling in four vans appeared at the National Museum of American History and gave a glorious concert up-lifting the spirit of all in Flag Hall in front of the Star-Spangled Banner. The story of Holy Trinity Music School over the past fty years is incredible. No matter the adversity\u2014whether earthquake, hurricane, military coup, or political upheaval\u2014they never lose hope. They offer their music to preserve, and strengthen the soul of their people. Today they still practice and play in temporary make-shift facilities. The sound of music continues to be heard throughout the campus of Holy Trinity Cathedral and beyond.

I spent many late nights as the AIC-CERT Katrina volunteer coordinator scrambling to be of assistance to the conservators who had joined the American Association of State and Local History camper homes as they tried to make their way around a devastated Louisiana and Mississippi. Coordinating between my private lab in California, the AIC of ce, and conservators who were literally in the eld with maps of roads that no longer existed, was a challenge to say the least. Participating in the response effort launched by the Smithsonian Institution in Haiti was a privilege. Responding as an AIC-CERT member can be a daunting solo act. The response to disasters such as Katrina required us to go into full \"take-charge\" mode. In situations where the AIC-CERT member responds alone, the main focus of the project is making order out of chaos. Responders quickly learn that striving for perfection will only serve to stymie the project. Creative problem solving, project ownership, and improvisation, are usually the responder's strongest assets. Setting foot on Haitian soil, I knew that this response effort was going to be radically different from the response to Katrina. The energetic chaos of the airport in Port-au-Prince was my rst taste of the richness of Haitian culture. Being proud of my independence as a world traveler, it took me a beat to give in and pay to let the porter claim my luggage. As I moved out of the airport, the noise and struggle began to recede and fade away. In my mind, the parting of the stormy waters was brought on by the friendly face belonging to the gentleman standing in front of the car, holding the sign that said \"Perkins.\" In Haiti responders had the luxury of joining a team that was already in place. Project Manager Olsen Jean Julien, International Project Coordinator Cori Wegener, and Chief Conservator Stephanie Hornbeck, had already completed the initial planning and implementation of a complex project that was to last for well over a year. Fellow responders Karen Pavelka, David Goist, and I formed just one of the many teams that would serve the project. Direction from project leaders allowed us the luxury of using our conservation training instead of our emergency response training. It was reassuring to be able to follow the direction of the Chief Conservator, knowing that she had the big picture of collections in need and resources available to address these needs. Stephanie provided guidance on treatment protocol that would insure uniformity to the project as the labs and treatments passed from one team to the next. Participating in this project taught us the value of being able to step out of solo responder mode and work as a team. We formed lasting bonds with team members, the country of Haiti and its people, AIC staff, and the Smithsonian Institution.

Photo by Gail Joice/Smithsonian 100 RESTORING HOPE NOT FOR SALE OR REPRODUCTIONWhile much of the Smithsonian effort went into the establishment of the Cultural Recovery Center and the rescue and treatment of Haiti's cultural collections, we'd always been concerned with Haiti's living cultural practices\u2014from the traditional to the newly created, and encouraging their vitality. 101 RESTORING HOPE NOT FOR SALE OR REPRODUCTIONDuring our rst visit, Georges Nader's comments about the lack of materials for artists to paint with led us to develop the idea of cultural care packages. On our return, I told a number of people about it and Diana N'Diaye sent out e-mails to people who might be interested. Colleagues at the National Museum of African Art, led by Conservator Steve Mellor, took up the idea and organized a collection and sent a package to Georges. It was the rst to arrive. I told Vicki Sant, the Chair of the Board of the National Gallery of Art about the effort, and she spread the word to others who sent packages. Professional artists were not the only ones to paint scenes of the earthquake or represent life in Haiti. Elisabeth Pr\u00e9val and artist Philippe Dodard had arranged for children in two Port-au-Prince neigh-borhoods to return to school after the earthquake\u2014not in their collapsed building, but in school buses he had been able to get for the purpose. Children were encouraged to express their experiences through draw-ing, providing a way of processing their feelings. When Michelle Obama and Jill Biden visited Haiti, they went to the school buses and painted with Elisabeth Pr\u00e9val and the children. Mrs. Pr\u00e9val's staff called one afternoon. She was in Washington with some of the children's art work and asked whether the Smithsonian might display a selection of the paintings. Johnnetta Cole and I hur-ried over to meet her, viewed some of the works and on the spot agreed to mount the exhibition\u2014and we needed to do it by June, timed with the opening of the Smithsonian Folklife Festival which would also fea-ture several Haitian artists and performers. In record time, Chief Curator Chris Kreamer and the staff of the National Museum of African Art produced and opened the exhibition The Healing Power of Art: Works of Art by Haitian Children after the Earthquake in the Smithsonian's S. Dillon Ripley Center. It was a hit, and occasioned thousands of visitors to not only view the children's art, but compose their own as a response to the children of Haiti. It was cultural understanding and exchange in action. At the same time, the Center for Folklife and Cultural Heritage was arranging the shipping of hundreds of crafts from Port-au-Prince and Jacmel to the National Mall in Washington, D.C., for the Smithsonian Folklife Festival. Vodou flag maker Mireille Delism\u00e9 and painter Levoy Exil would dem-onstrate their art daily. A special concert featuring the popular Haitian musical group Boukman Eksperyans (named after a seminal figure of the Haitian revolution) and introduced by Haitian Ambassador to the U.S. Raymond Joseph, was a rousing and joyous success. Crafts generated more than $50,000 in sales and helped get needed cash into the pockets of numerous artists. Geri Benoit joined us for part of the Festival in order to arrange some of the Festival materials to be sent to Rome. She was busy as ever promoting Haitian art, fashion, and cuisine in Europe, and seeking opportunities for Haitian artists and cultural gures. During the summer we had results to show from the Recovery Center, and T oby Dodds, the webmaster for the Center for Folklife and Cultural Heritage, put together a website for the project. Olsen had staff in Haiti translate the pages into French and Krey\u00f2l and we were online at www.haiti.si.edu. In September, Smithsonian magazine published a cover story on Haitian art after the earthquake. Bill Brubaker, a collector and aficionado, renewed his friendships with Georges Nader and Pr\u00e9f\u00e8te Duffaut, and described the challenges facing purveyors of perhaps Haiti's best known export\u2014its art. The Smithsonian had commissioned Frantz Z\u00e9phirin to do an original painting for the cover, and then held an auction for the work, with the proceeds donated to the Haiti Cultural Recovery Project. Stories in other media on Haiti's art and culture continued, on television, YouTube, in the press, and on radio. The Smithsonian Channel was at work on a documentary following the project. In the fall, the Smithsonian's National Museum of American History hosted the boys' choir and orchestral ensemble of the Holy Trinity Music School. The group was on its annual U.S. tour, providing a means for Haitian youth to see America, and also to raise funds for their music program. They performed a concert of Haitian and American compositions in Flag Hall, 102 RESTORING HOPE NOT FOR SALE OR REPRODUCTIONARTISTS' CARE PACKAGES GEORGES NADER, JR. The January 2010 earthquake destroyed houses, stores, of ces, and other types of structures. The artistic community was not spared as many of Haiti's painters and sculptors lost their studios, homes, and all their art supplies. The art supply stores were also demolished. There was no infrastructure to obtain and resell art supplies. As the artists were particularly inspired and feeling creative in the aftermath of the earthquake, they were desperately looking for the necessary tools to express themselves, but to no avail. Some of them reached out to the Nader Gallery in the hope of nding brushes and canvasses. Unfortunately, the Gallery had none to give them. It is very common for Haitian artists to be inspired by and to portray the current situation in their country. For example, political turmoil in Haiti appears on the paintings that were created during the fall of Duvalier in 1986 and other subsequent coups d'\u00e9tat. The same phe- nomenon was happening in the months following the earthquake: the artists were eager to represent various scenes of what they had witnessed, and what was left. In March 2010, when a group from the Smithsonian visited Haiti and became aware of this problem, Richard Kurin decided to put in place an art supplies drive. A few months later, Nader Gallery had received a donation of various boxes of art supplies including brushes, paint, and canvasses, from the National Museum of African Art to be distributed to Haitian artists. All of these supplies were donated to over 100 painters who were thus able to portray the earth- quake and its aftermath.

It was a performance they were to reprise a year later at the Smithsonian, and combine with a visit to the National Museum of African Art to see the sculpture of T oussaint Louverture, now on public display. Appreciation of Haiti's cultural vitality, as sym- bolized by its youth, emerged again in October, when First Lady Michelle Obama hosted the National Y outh Awards ceremony at the White House. The President's Committee had decided to give a special international award to a Haitian youth musical group from Jacmel. Committee Vice-Chair Mary Schmidt Campbell, who introduced the group, invited the Haitian Ambassador to join Mrs. Obama and continued: This year's earthquake in Haiti completely devastated many of the country's most important cultural landmarks and institutions. Thanks to the expertise of our colleagues at the Smithsonian Institution and with support from the President's Committee, the Haitian Cultural Recovery Project was able to work in support of the government of Haiti to salvage and secure important cultural artifacts buried in the rubble and badly damaged. During the summer, members of the PCAH joined a delegation to Port-au-Prince, led by our colleagues at the Smithsonian. What was clear to all of us on that trip was that even amidst that devastation the vitality of Haiti's cultural heritage was very much alive.On the streets of Port-au-Prince, we saw evidence of the work of the artisans and musicians who continue traditions that have become vital to world culture. We witnessed the resilience of a youth orchestra that rehearsed beautifully while overlooking the debris and rubble that surrounded them. First Lady Pr\u00e9val hosted a group of young dancers who despite having to live in tented camps that served as temporary homes after the earthquake left them homeless, treated us to a spirited performance. They, the young people, with all of their resilience and energy, with all of their talents and gifts, represent the promise and future of Haiti. The Haitian Cultural Recovery Project par- ticipated in two other exhibitions. Saving Grace: A Celebration of Haitian Art opened at the Affirmation Arts gallery in New Y ork. The show, arranged by Bill Hillman, Gallery Director Marla Goldwasser, and Georges Nader, was curated by Gerald Alexis. It fea-tured Hector Hyppolite's Pot de Fleurs restored by Nick Dorman Celestin Faustin's Un Beau R\u00eave restored by Hitoshi Kimura, as well as dozens of others repre-senting a full range and panoply of Haitian creativity. Building Back Better opened at the William J. Clinton Presidential Center in Little Rock, Arkansas. It featured the former president's involvement with Haiti, aspects of Haitian culture, and history. A major section concerned the earthquake, the humanitarian response, reconstruction plans, and the challenges ahead. A case featured fragments of the Holy Trinity murals and the recovery project. We wanted to give Haitian art, the Haitian people, a voice. -Marla Goldwasser Haiti has long known the blues. When the earthquake struck, our response was to attempt to show every color of the rainbow that is Haitian art. Saving Grace, our not-for-pro t survey exhibition of painting, curated by Gerald Alexis, opened less than nine months after the disaster, presenting a \"before and after\" example of the Cultural Recovery Project's work. The show was a celebration, especially for New York's Haitian community. We remain committed to the Smithsonian's effort to rescue Haiti's threatened art, and even more so to the empowerment of the Haitian people to safeguard and honor their past, while creating, with love and respect, their future .\u2014W. T. Hillman, Af rmation Arts 104 RESTORING HOPE NOT FOR SALE OR REPRODUCTIONWITH CULTURAL CARE IN MIND STEVE MELLOR We are all aware of, and possibly participated on an individual level in, the worldwide outpouring of contributions to humanitarian relief efforts in Haiti after the earthquake. Such unrestricted giving, I believe, is a fundamental component of human compassion and comes straight from the heart. We give as generously as we are able with the belief that every drop coalesces and swells into a wave of hope. The fact that we may become temporarily dismayed by stories of inequity or poor distribution does not suppress the giving spirit and we forge ahead with kindness and grace. The staff at the Smithsonian's National Museum of African Art had an opportunity to give in a unique way in response to a call from Richard Kurin for 'Cultural Care Packages. ' The packages were to contain art materials, from a speci c list, including painting canvas, stretchers, brushes, modeling paste, and paint itemized by color, to be distributed to Haitian artists to help sustain the extraordinary art tradition that exists in Haiti, during this tragedy. Museums depend on contributions from our board members, benefactors, and membership and thus it was a simple step for the Museum's staff members to seize this opportunity for art-focused giving. With list in pocket and cash in hand my conservation intern and I set out to shop at Utrecht's Art Supply on 12th Street N.W. in Washington, D.C. Curiously, several characteristics of an art conservator came into play during our shopping spree. The detailed list of desired materi-als, particularly paint colors, guided the precision with which we made our selections. No doubt the artists had a clear vision of their palette and any deviation was simply not an option. Secondly, to those of us for whom tools are an intimate extension of our thoughts, decisions, and skills, the selection of tools became a personal affair. Palette knives were gently fl exed, bristles were brushed across the wrist, and stretcher bars were sighted for straight and plumb. The Cultural Care Package from the National Museum of African Art was a joy to assemble and provided for us a collegial connection to our as yet, unmet friends in Haiti. We hope that this small token fuels our collective creative spirit and continues to unite us through art.

PR\u00c9VAL In Haiti, one child out of twelve dies before the age of ve. The causes are well known: respiratory infections, fever, diarrhea, dehydration, malnutrition. The fate of many of them is decided just after birth: little chance to attend school, to receive appropriate medical care, to obtain a birth certi cate. Most of them will become marginalized citizens for life. After such a tremendous disaster as the one brought by the January 12 earthquake, children are the most affected groups of our society. I immediately fought for them to be the rst to receive a special attention. That's why I created, together with Haitian artist Philippe Dodard, the program \"Plas Timoun\": a place dedicated to children where they could receive appropriate attention and also socialize. Lacking school rooms or other facilities after the earthquake, we started with thirty buses equipped as informal classrooms in which Haitian artists led workshops for reading, painting, sculpting, danc- ing, theatre, and subjects. More than 3,000 children living in Port-au-Prince's tarp and tent camps attended the program. In this way, Plas Timoun offered an imaginative place for children to have the opportunity to dream and to create. Among the activities at Plas Timoun, children were encouraged to draw what they had experienced in the earthquake and its aftermath\u2014to let their feelings out, but also express their hopes for a future life. I have personally experienced the healing power of art, the therapeutic power of art, and Michelle Obama and Jill Biden joined us when they visited Haiti. The paintings produced by the children were exhibited at the Smithsonian's National Museum of African Art and seen by more than 5,000 children among the tens of thousands of visitors. In the museum, the particular drama of the Haitian children was gracefully brought up to the world stage. The paintings raised awareness about differences in people's backgrounds, circumstances, and conditions, but more so generated a feeling of solidarity and compassion with Haiti and its citizens. The children's art also allowed visitors to learn more about Haiti, a country that inspired and surprised the world, when in 1804 it became the rst Black republic, when vibrant personalities such as our hero, Toussaint Louverture emerged as a worldwide symbol of freedom. During the several times I came to Washington after the earthquake and visited the Smithsonian, I felt particularly touched, special, and privileged to see and admire an impressive seven-foot tall statue of Toussaint Louverture sculpted by Senegalese artist Ousmane Sow and depicted liberating a woman slave. To see this work on display, as an \"icon\" of the National Museum of African Art was uplifting, and reassured me that the world would continue to remember the Haitian people. Haitians are a people of creators. They create from nothing. Creation transcends poverty and ideology. Artists invent a new world where hope takes birth from the most terrible catastrophe. For me, art should be an important piece of the strategy to rebuild Haiti, because it mobilizes the internal energy that sleeps in every one of us; because it puts us in touch with the universal part of ourselves we share with a common humanity, where the values of solidarity, brotherhood, love, dignity, and respect for life become the driver of our behavior.

In response to that devastating event and its aftermath, what would you draw or paint? This is the question that compelled the National Museum of African Art to organize\u2014in just six short weeks\u2014an exhibi- tion entitled The Healing Power of Art: Works of Art by Haitian Children after the Earthquake . The story was told by some ninety works on paper created by the children of \"Plas Timoun,\" \"the Children's Place,\" established by Pr\u00e9val and realized by world-renowned artist Philippe Dodard. Operating from converted buses at two sites in Port-au-Prince, Plas Timoun offered art therapy as a primary service to help heal the children of Haiti. At rst, the children drew dark images of what they had seen and felt that included black and red with very little else. Soon, however, more vibrant colors were introduced. The power of art to heal became apparent as the experiences of the rst grim weeks were released and began to give way to expressions of a more hopeful and brighter tomorrow. The frightening, heartbreaking, and charming drawings by the children of Plas Timoun touched each and every staff member of the National Museum of African Art. Despite other obligations and deadlines long on the books, Museum staff opened their hearts and extended their days to create a beautiful, respectful, and welcoming exhibition geared to children and adults alike. In record time, exhibition texts were drafted and transformed into an attractively designed full-color brochure that arrived at the Museum the day before the opening. Our archivist scrambled to secure rights for photographs, video footage, and published quotations that would put a human face to the tragedy and would capture the enormity of the devastation. Our graphics designer recommended brightly colored frames for the children's drawings and selected for the exhibition walls a range of pastel hues suggestive of Haitian architecture. Our chief conservator led the effort, turning his conservation lab into a command center where drawings were organized, treated, framed, and made ready for display. Over 5,000 children from around the world who saw the exhibition drew pictures and wrote notes lled with hope. We have sent these love notes to the children of Haiti. Our fervent hope is that people everywhere will keep Haiti in their hearts and will do what they can to help alleviate the suffering and hardship wrought by the Haitian earthquake of 2010.

Every exhibition visitor was invited to draw a picture of friendship or a brighter tomorrow and write a message of hope for rebuilding the schools in Haiti. The Museum assured their delivery to the children participating in the arts activities at \"Plas Timoun\" in Port-au-Prince. Exhibition visitors\u2014and virtual visitors\u2014came from every state in the U.S. and some twenty- eight other nations, and composed more than ve thousand sincere and compassionate mes- sages and drawings for the children of Haiti. Teachers used the activity as a catalyst for classroom discussion on themes encompassing psychological, cultural, economic, and humanitarian concerns. A photo gallery of a selection of the drawings and messages was created on the Museum's Facebook page, motivating further discussion from the on-line community. Due to the success of the community interaction and outreach, the exhibit was extended for ve months beyond its original closing date. In addition, a real-time video-conference was convened in November 2010 at the U.S. Department of Education as the opening event for International Education Week, taking the exhibition beyond the museum walls through new media. A cross-cultural exchange between a group of the young artists in Port-au-Prince and an award-winning French Club at J.O. Wilson Public Elementary School in Washington, D.C., connected the children across international borders. Special pre-conference drawings and messages in French and English were created by the children to share. The thousands of messages of hope and friendship created by Smithsonian visitors were hand delivered to Haiti in April 2011. Future Plas Timoun programs are planned in Haiti to continue the psychological support needed to carry on the work of treating on-going symptoms of post traumatic stress and anxiety. The exhibition and its outreach programming cast into relief the important part museums can play in creating a platform for deep social engagement and the interconnected space between art, healing, and community.

It was wrenching to see this blow to the people whose creativity and resilience were remarkable despite the enormous challenges the country had faced since its founding in 1804. Was the devastated landscape of this brave but beleaguered city going to be the coupe de grace that nally conquered this nation of freedom and independence-loving people? What to say to our friends and colleagues? We knew many artists perished in the earthquake; many others were terribly injured. What would happen to the livelihoods of more than 40,000 artists that fed and housed thousands more through their beautiful creations infused with the stories, images, and songs of Haitian life? How best could we, at the Smithsonian Center for Folklife and Cultural Heritage, help living artists use their heritage to recover and rebuild? Meeting with Patrick Delatour, Patrick Vilaire, Olsen Jean Julien, Georges Nader, and crafts co-op organizer Gisele Fleurant, we quickly devised a plan for the Smithsonian to purchase thousands of dollars of Haitian crafts to sell at the annual Smithsonian Folklife Festival to take place in June. This would put money in artists' hands and encourage cultural production and recovery. Haitian craftspeople, artists, and musicians would be invited to perform and demonstrate their skill at the Festival and draw continued attention to Haitian culture during this crucial time. In the weeks that followed, Gisele, Georges, and Moru Baruk from Jacmel, mobilized artists, materials, and packing for shipment. Challenges abounded: artists had lost studios, brushes, canvas, even paint with which to work. Precious sup- plies of beads and sequins were no longer available. Transferring advance funds to artists and getting bills of lading took double the usual time. Crafts from Jacmel almost missed the transport because there were not enough salvageable boxes in which to pack the items. Vodou fl ag maker Mireille Delism\u00e9 and painter Levoy Exil came for one-week artist residencies at the Smithsonian Folklife Festival to demonstrate their work. The Festival Marketplace lled with the work of metal sculptors, papier-mach\u00e9 carnival mask makers, along with painted wood, sequined bags, and other iconic Haitian crafts. The response of Festival visitors to the marketplace was enthusiastic, generating tens of thousands of dollars in sales. Many of the crafts sold out within the rst week. Krey\u00f2l speakers from local Haitian American communities mobilized, helping to translate for the visiting artists, and to help in the marketplace and at the concert featuring Boukman Eksperyans and troubadour Tine Salvant. Haitian Ambassador Raymond Joseph introduced the groups who performed to packed audiences on the National Mall in front of the Smithsonian Castle. In media interviews Boukman founders, Mimerose and Lolo Beaubrun, spoke about the important roles for artists in the recovery. Participation in the Haiti Cultural Recovery Project with Haitian friends and colleagues has been a deeply meaningful and even personally transformative experience. As a researcher, artist, and African descendant, it has been the ful llment of a life-long interest to facilitate the presentation of Haitian culture to a wider public. I was already impressed by the artistic and intellectual virtuosity, dynamism, and cultural con dence of Haitian artists, scholars, organizers, cultural activists, storytellers. After the earthquake I was awed and humbled by their inner reserves and the capacity to overcome adversity. I was particularly incensed by the false media portrayal of Haitians as helpless victims and took pride in the way that the Smithsonian has worked with, not around, not in spite of, our Haitian colleagues in a process of reciprocal learning and mutual capacity building.

If we were going to see a renaissance of Haitian culture we needed to promote it around the world. I worked with the Smithsonian to bring Haitian arts and crafts from the Festival Marketplace to Rome to be offered, with other items by Anna Fendi and Stephanel, at the Haitian Embassy Christmas Bazaar. The Embassy, with support from Italy's Minister of Culture and AVSI, helped promote some of Haiti's best artists like Edouard Duval-Carrie, Sergine Andre, and Jean-Herard Celeur, a Sculptor of the Grand Rue of Atis-Resistans Collective to the Venice 54th Biennale of Contemporary Art\u2014the rst Haitian Pavilion at the Biennale. This was a rousing success with sales and media attention calling the Haiti exhibition one of the \" ve must-sees.\" Still a year later, the Embassy launched Fashion-ABLE: Haiti in partnership with the Inter-American Bank of Development, McKinsey and HaitiCFI to promote viable cultural industries in Haiti. The project seeks to join Haiti's world-recognized design skills and artisanal production capabilities with the Italian fashion industry and American high-end markets. Diaspora fashion designers like Haitian-Italian Stella Jean can provide a bridge between Haitian producers and worldwide consumers. Encouraging Haitian creativity and providing outlets for it can not only energize a cultural renaissance but also have enormously signi cant economic consequences.

The project's mission and the arrangements needed to get it up and running quickly and ef ciently in Haiti through the Cultural Recovery Center in Port-au-Prince shaped its management structure. The Smithsonian took the lead in managing the overall project. This meant concluding formal memo- randa of understanding with the Government of Haiti, both through the Ministry of T ourism and Commission for the Emergency and Reconstruction and the Ministry of Culture and Communication. This established the legal basis for the operation of the Haiti Cultural Recovery Center in Port-au-Prince and for mutual oversight and collaboration. Implementation of these provisions and the responsibility for on-the-ground coordination rest with Olsen Jean Julien as the Center' s Manager.CHAPTER SEVEN OPERATING THE HAITI CULTURAL RECOVERY CENTER Setting up and managing the country's rst Cultural Recovery Center, only ve months after a devastating earthquake, was like developing a plan to walk through an unknown city wrapped into the deepest fog.

FOKAL would receive funds monthly from the Smithsonian to disburse to the Center for budgeted expenses. Agreements and formal contracts between the Smithsonian and ICCROM, and with AIC, allowed for payments by the Smithsonian for speci c designated services. The Smithsonian executed formal contracts with Olsen, Cori Wegener, Stephanie Hornbeck (via Caryatid Conservation Services, Inc.), Rosa Lowinger, and Virginia Dominguez and others, like building landlord Samir Handal, for the provision of goods and services to accomplish the Center's work. The Smithsonian also had such a contract in place with the Haitian Ministry of Culture and Communication to accomplish speci cally designated projects with its var- ious cultural agencies. Depending upon the particular type of service and arrangement, either I, Olsen, Cori, or Stephanie, would typically be the one to manage the relationship and coordinate the service provision. I would deal mainly with the of cial entities, funding, and contracting; Cori with cooperating organizations, Stephanie with conservators, and Olsen with running the Center. Obtaining funds was always a challenge, and the early support of The Broadway League plain and sim-ple made the project possible. Support from the federal cultural agencies was important in providing the con-servators. The majority of funds were to come from U.S. AID. Funding for the Haiti Cultural Recovery Project was included in the U.S. Supplemental Appropriations Act of 2010, P .L. 111-212, (HR 4899) Chapter 10, the Act for Haiti, a $917 million alloca- tion for earthquake relief which was passed by the U.S. Congress on July 27, 2010, and signed by President Obama two days later. It took months and months after that however, for the Smithsonian to actually receive its $2 million funding, and so it had to expend its own money as \"risk\" or \"advance\" funds\u2014essentially loan-ing itself the money for the project with the expec-tation that it would eventually receive the allotment from U.S. AID. The delay was due to the fact that Congress required the Secretary of State to submit a detailed spending plan for the appropriation. This was done in the fall, with the concurrence of the Administrator of U.S. AID. The Haiti Cultural Recovery Project was described in the spending plan: As part of this effort to strengthen Haiti's public institu- tions, supplemental funds will also be provided to the Smithsonian to support the needed preservation of Haiti's cultural heritage\u2014important as both a social and economic asset in Haiti's future development. USAID will provide $2 million toward support of the Haiti Cultural Recovery Project. That project, organized and managed by the Smithsonian Institution (under formal agreement with the GOH Ministry of Culture and Communication and Haiti's Presidential Commission for Reconstruction, in partnership with the U.S. President's Committee on the Arts and the Humanities) rescues, recovers, safeguards and helps restore Haitian artwork, artifacts, documents, media, and architec-tural features damaged and endangered by the earthquake and its aftermath. The project operates a Cultural Recovery Center in a certi ed safe and secure building which houses conservation labs and facilities where cultural materials are catalogued, treated and stored. The project also targets Haiti's public and private museums and culturally signi cant sites, and trains dozens of Haitians in heritage conservation and management. That spending plan was reviewed by Congress. A number of bureaucratic hurdles had to be cleared by U.S. AID and the Smithsonian concerning the existence of a proper appropriation account for the funds and the standing of the Smithsonian and the project to meet the conditions regarding expenditures for foreign aid. This took months and the involvement of the Department of the Treasury and the Office of Management and Budget in order to resolve. The Smithsonian and U.S. AID concluded an Inter-Agency Transfer agreement on December 27, 2010, and the Smithsonian actually received the funds months later\u2014about thirteen months after the earthquake and nine months after beginning its work. Overall, the project (essentially the operation of the Center in Haiti, and not including the various exhibitions and activities in the U.S) from inception to November 1, 2011, was budgeted at $3,265,000 . Of this amount, about $560,000 consists of in-kind ser- vices provided by the volunteer conservators deployed through the American Institute for Conservation (who took no fees, though their travel, room, board, and mis-cellaneous expenses had to be covered) and the service of Smithsonian conservators, experts, and others whose salary was paid for by the Smithsonian. Operating the Center in Port-au-Prince, paying its staff and service providers, renting, operating, and securing the Center's building, renting vehicles, constructing labs and storage, and conducting training consumed the overwhelming part of the budget. The return on this investment has been quite large, and points to what became a very ef cient operation. Considering just the treatment of 30,000 items of material culture as an output, it cost on average roughly $100 per item to conserve. There was of course a great deal of variability in the actual costs on individual items by type\u2014preserving the three Holy Trinity murals cost about $250,000, whereas cleaning some of the library books may have cost a few dollars a piece. 120 OPERATING THE HAITI CULTURAL RECOVERY CENTER NOT FOR SALE OR REPRODUCTIONHAITI CULTURAL RECOVERY PROJECT STRUCTURE COOPERATING INSTITUTIONS\u2014INTERNATIONAL ICCROM Training UNESCO CoordinationInternational Committee of the Blue Shield Coordination COOPERATING INSTITUTIONS\u2014 HAITIAN NON-GOVERNMENTAL FOKAL Fondation Connaissance et & Museum Rainbow GalleryAtelier Jean Rene JeromeFondation Culture Creation Galerie Flamboyant Galerie Gingerbread Museum of Haitian Art SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION ManagementProcurementVolunteer Conservators & ExpertsVenues, programs, products HAITIAN CULTURAL RECOVERY CENTER (Centre de Sauvetage de Biens Culturels)ManagementFacilityOperationsConservation Labs/ActivitiesTrainingStaf ng Support ServicesCommunication, Liaison COOPERATING President's Committee on the Arts and the Humanities PartnershipU.S. Department of State Coordination American Institute for Conservation of Historic and Artistic Works Volunteer ConservatorsU.S. Committee of the Blue Shield Advice/CoordinationWilliam J.

To do so, we needed to set up a system for documenting and reviewing expenditures. Alison McNally, the Smithsonian's Under Secretary for Finance and Administration, travelled to Haiti to meet with Joseph Jean Baptiste Mentor and his staff at the Center to ensure proper, auditable procedures which were then reviewed by the Smithsonian's Office of the Comptroller. Each and every Center transaction has been accompanied by a receipt. Every dollar\u2014whether in Haitian gourdes , Haitian dollars, or American currency, has been accounted for in monthly reports to the Smithsonian. The Center, FOKAL, and the Smithsonian have kept meticulous nancial records and have followed established regular reporting and accountability measures to assure the proper use of funds. Putting in place the structure and funding to operate the Center is a means to an end. The fulfillment of the project's mission comes through the substantive work of the Center, saving items from the rubble, taking in collections, treating and inventorying them, working on special projects such as the Holy Trinity murals, and conducting training courses and workshops. Operationally, this work has necessitated close interactions with Haiti's key public and private cultural institutions.TRANSACTION AMOUNT DATE PAYEE PURPOSE NUMBER U.S. $ EQ.* R920 $10.06 1 August Station Total Supplies R921 $105.03 1 August Comcel Haiti Phone service R922 $509.97 1 August Telecom SA Internet services 3 mos.

These are mainly those Haitians and Americans who carry out innumerable tasks to enable the Center to accomplish its mission. They keep the Center clean and secure, drive conservators to sites and collections, build and transport things, answer the telephones, make the copies, buy the sup-plies, arrange shipments, keep accounts, process con-tracts, and provide the services that are absolutely necessary for the project to function. As the Center has developed, so too have its rou- tines and procedures. It has provided a needed source of stability for many lives. None the less, the Center's staff, consultants, contractors, conservators, and trainees have faced and overcome considerable personal dif cul- ties to well-serve the project's mission. Many Haitians and their families continue to live in substandard condi-tions, displaced from homes, struggling with basic ser-vices, and with relatives out of work or in poor health. For some of the long term American and international staff, service to the Center has meant being away from family, friends, and home, and in an environment where one is always mindful of safety and security concerns. All who work at the Center have been affected by the arrival of tropical storms and hurricanes. The cholera epidemic made all aware of a dangerous health situation, and prompted preventive measures. The long Haitian presidential election process engendered peri-ods of instability which at times forced the Center to prudently close. Add to these circumstances a general lack of public security, gangs, and violence in the refu-gee camps and other ills connected to alcoholism and drug abuse, and one can understand the unsettling backdrop of life in Port-au-Prince. Indeed, the wife of one of the Center's staffers was kidnapped. It had noth-ing to do with her husband's position or the Center's work, and she was safely returned\u2014but it rattled all of us. In another case, an employee of the landlord of our rented \"conservator's house\"\u2014where many of our Smithsonian and AIC conservators have stayed\u2014became intoxicated and made inappropriate advances to one of the occupants. The police were called, and the offender was summarily dismissed. Y et with all the difficulties, the vast majority of the people who have worked at, deployed to, and been involved in the Center have found it to be a comfort-able, professional, safe, and secure facility. They have found it a place of friendship and strong camaraderie, joining together people of diverse interests and back-grounds. And the work it does is universally regarded as vitally signi cant for inspiring Haiti's future. Without any instruction or direction, several of the conservation assistants\u2014Junior Nor\u00e9lus, Joseph Racine, Wanglish Michel, and Franck Fontain, artists in their own right\u2014created a wonderful mural in the compound's court-yard, a symbolic representation of the Center's spirit.

First and foremost was the uncertainty about events and the people. Setting up and managing the country's rst Cultural Recovery Center, only ve months after a devastating earthquake, was like developing a plan to walk through an unknown city wrapped into the deepest fog. No matter how sensitive or discriminating your judgment could be, no matter how skilled or intelligent, you had to be ready to face many surprises. For many of us working at the Center, this experience was also emotionally challenging. Working with a constantly changing team of people from different backgrounds and cultures, in a post-earthquake environment, and after witnessing the loss of some 300,000 human lives, makes for a very dif cult undertaking. I knew and accepted this. And, in this context, I had to plan, organize, coordinate, lead, and control the Center's activities, aided by the supervision and guidance of the Smithsonian Institution, and the Government of Haiti. Fortunately, the Smithsonian-Haitian Government partnership was rock solid at the highest levels. My relationship with the lead Ministers, Marie-Laurence Lass\u00e8gue and Patrick Delatour, was strong and had a long history. Richard Kurin and I exchanged e-mails many times daily\u2014some 4,000 over the course of the project. FOKAL, as our scal agent, shared in the goals of the project and had developed dependable procedures with both, the Smithsonian and the Cultural Recovery Center, for the movement and accounting of funds. We continued to work well with other partners. U. S. Committee of the Blue Shield and the American Institute for Conservation, were totally engaged and dependable. Richard negotiated a series of additional agreements with UNESCO, ICCROM, and the International Committee of People were trying to save everything they could, but with no means, no resources and we needed to reinforce their efforts. -Olsen Jean Julien 126 OPERATING THE HAITI CULTURAL RECOVERY CENTER NOT FOR SALE OR REPRODUCTIONthe Blue Shield to help with various aspects of the project and ensure coordination with other efforts. I worked closely with the Haitian public cultural agencies and private organizations to keep all informed and to coordinate what we called \"Special Recovery Projects\" to ad- dress the needs of each collection taking into account particular institutional contexts. During the course of our work we de ned nine Special Recovery Projects with the collaboration of the Centre d'Art, ISPAN, MUPANAH, Episcopal Church, National Archives, National Library, Corvington Collection, Trouillot Collection, and the Foundation for Production and Valorization of Cultural Heritage which owns the Lehmann Collection. I served as the liaison with project coordinators from each of these institutions, learned a lot about Haitian history, art, and culture, and about keeping our projects clear and focused. The rst two big special projects\u2014 treating over 7,400 art works and documents in the Centre d'Art collection, and saving the murals at the Holy Trinity Episcopal Cathedral were major, became widely known in Haiti and beyond, and inspired con dence with other organizations. We also took in smaller numbers of collection items from many other galleries, museums, and archives, which we processed in our three functioning conservation studios for objects, paintings, and works on paper. We thought training Haitians in collection management and conservation was a vitally im- portant activity from the beginning, and started planning training activities from the day we opened in June 2010. We enlisted ICCROM as a partner and they, working with the CRC staff and the Smithsonian, developed a three-week long session in August 2010, for twenty-six participants from fourteen cultural institutions. In turn, these trainees then took the lead in de ning special projects for their institutions\u2014the best of which we chose to pursue. Events, both surprising and predictable, continued to unfold throughout the evolution of the project. With the hurricane season from June to November 2010, the cholera outbreak in October 2010, and the presidential elections from November 2010 to March 2011, the environ-ment was completely volatile. But the planning process, recognizing no single approach would do, continued to allow us to re-adapt our strategies. With these contingencies and a variety of partners and collaborators, coordination became key\u2014and one of my most essential responsibilities. Inside the CRC, I facilitated the coordina- tion between the special recovery projects, training activities, conservation treatment, and the logistic aspects of CRC management. Every Monday at 9 a.m., I held a CRC staff meeting. In those weekly sessions, I met with the registrar, training coordinator, chief conservator, of ce manager, and administrative assistant, to discuss the activities for the week, de ne the priori- ties, and coordinate the use of our limited resources in a collaborative working environment. Sometimes, I extended these meetings to visiting conservators, laboratory assistants, and special project coordinators, to get them more involved and engaged. I would use the meetings to explain our progress, identify new problems, nd solutions to them, and make sure our activities were comprehensively and coherently understood. For me, the CRC staff meetings were like a barometer. With them, I could get a feel for what was going on inside the CRC and in the broader, often challenging external environment. I could understand the urgent issues, smell potential confl icts among the activities, and an- ticipate solutions when possible. With the team effort at the CRC, and with the support of our many partners, and very talented and knowledgeable people, we were able to develop an unusual clarity to walk through the fog and progress with the project's goals and objectives.

Photo by Stephanie Hornbeck 127 OPERATING THE HAITI CULTURAL RECOVERY CENTER NOT FOR SALE OR REPRODUCTIONTHE CENTER'S CONSERVATION PROGRAM STEPHANIE HORNBECK The Haiti Cultural Recovery Project was shaped by several variables, which while constraining, nonetheless, contributed to its programmatic success. First, the extensive damage to cultural heritage generally and collections speci cally, created a great need for specialized professional expertise to undertake a response and to introduce a professional conservation methodology to a nation without it. Second, an agreed to eighteen-month term for the project xed the time period. Third, the staf ng model depended upon numerous participants serving for successive short periods. Last, a tight budget imposed constraints on staf ng and necessitated the careful weighing and prioritization of project needs. To conform to these parameters, while supporting project initiatives, we needed a simple, practical, and adaptable con-servation structure for the project. It had to allow for multiple levels of expertise from beginning assistant to experienced conservator, as well as the interchangeability of individuals. A volunteer model with rapid turn-over meant that treat-ments were often started by one conservator and nished by another. Procedures and documentation had to be deci-pherable by multiple people. Equipment like cameras and microscopes had to be \"user-friendly.\" Reproducible practical methods had to be employed. Continuity depended upon communication from person to person. PROJECT OVERSIGHT As the project was funded by American public and private sources and involved a large investment of American expertise, continuous oversight and communication were critical. Indeed, such an extensive project, with multiple partnerships, and an international dimension requires a clear command structure, where roles and responsibilities are clearly de ned. Richard Kurin and Cori Wegener developed a mission with clear goals that involved key stakeholders. Richard regularly communicated directives. Haitian Project Manager Olsen Jean Julien provided the critical interface to Haitian ministers and culture professionals. I organized conservation expertise to support preservation priorities established by Haitian cultural institutions. Because the funding for foreign conservators came from the Smithsonian Institution or via the Foundation of the American Institute for Conservation (FAIC), administering an Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS) grant, project conservators were accountable to those organizations, even while working in Haiti. It was important to ad-here to directives coming from the Smithsonian and to uphold standards of practice and the code of ethics of the AIC. Operationally, these mandates translated into providing professional conservation support for initiatives receiving Smithsonian funding. Yet, though accountable to American professional organizations, work was happening in Haiti; we had to respect the way of conducting business there by acculturating and striving for middle ground. STAFFING Our project has the good fortune to have a staff of professional Haitian colleagues who provided guidance and support for our conservation efforts. The role of determining what patrimony should be saved by the Smithsonian project rests with individual Haitian institutions; all decisions regarding prioritization by cultural value rest with Haitian professionals. Project Manager Olsen Jean Julien drew upon his numerous culture sector contacts from his recent tenure as Minister of Culture and Communication. Over time he established a network of professional colleagues at art institutions; these included directors, collection managers, and curators. Registrar Carmelita Douby interfaced with conservators by serving as project liaison for efforts at MUPANAH and the Lehmann Vodou collection, as well as tracking damaged works at the Center. Fritz Berg Jeannot assisted some fteen conservators and allied experts in the successful realization of training activities. Joseph Jean Baptiste Mentor oversaw logistics to transport and lodge conservators and purchased locally avail-able supplies as needed. Scaffolding offers some protection to the damaged Last Supper mural at the Holy Trinity Cathedral. Photo by Richard Kurin/Smithsonian 128 OPERATING THE HAITI CULTURAL RECOVERY CENTER NOT FOR SALE OR REPRODUCTIONNOT FOR SALE OR REPRODUCTIONThe conservation staf ng model involved a chief conservator, who provided a continuous presence in Haiti to oversee conservation activities, and staff conservators, who were contractors or volunteers. Over a six-month period, contract painting conservator Viviana Dominguez, and contract architectural materials conservator Rosa Lowinger, oversaw the Holy Trinity Cathedral murals conservation project. For periods ranging from six to twelve weeks, three contract conservators Ana\u00efs Gailhbaud (objects), Krist\u00edn G\u00edslad\u00f3ttir (paintings), and Bernard Colla (paper), participated in operations in the studios, focusing mainly on treatment. Upon nishing the murals project in June 2011, Dominguez was hired to oversee the activities of the painting conservation studio. Volunteer professional conservators from the Smithsonian Institution and AIC provided a large contribution to the work force. The support of AIC Executive Director Eryl Wentworth, and on-going efforts of Eric Pourchot, AIC Institutional Advancement Director, were essential. With the aid of a $90,000 IMLS grant and the coordination of the AIC-CERT Coordinator, rst Aimee Primeaux and then Beth Antoine, small teams of two or three conservators at a time deployed for two-week periods. While the mandated short deployments result in high turn-over and necessitate time-consuming continuous orientation of new volunteers, they had the positive aspects of regular infusions of fresh energy and enthusiasm. By the end of the project, forty-two volunteer conservators from fteen states in the United States and Quebec, Canada, contributed 415 days for an in-kind value of over $207,000. Of the forty-eight deployments (including repeat volunteers), the Smithsonian provided sixteen and AIC provided thirty-two.Lastly, we needed a corps of assistants to support our efforts on the ground. Through professional contacts and postings made at Haitian ne art, and chemistry programs, we hired and then trained twelve conservation assistants. Their fresh ideas and openness made for lively discussions about conservation concepts and inspired optimism, as I thought about the future face of preservation in Haiti. FACILITIES, SUPPLIES, AND EQUIPMENT A major conservation objective has been to establish conservation studios that have materials and equipment that will remain in Haiti, ideally at an accessible Center. The current Cultural Recovery Center operates in a former United Nations Development Program of ce building. We have retro- tted of ces to serve as studio and storage spaces. Access to stable archival and conservation grade materials is very limited, and 100% of such supplies must be imported. I relied greatly on AIC's Eric Pourchot to manage supply orders. To date, approximately $100,000 has been spent to purchase microscopes, easels, digital cameras, computers, printers, vacuums, fabrics, papers, adhesives, artist supplies, ne hand tools and heavy tools, and personal protective equipment. These have been hand-carried by conservators and other colleagues in more than sixty- ve trips. CONSERVATION ACTIVITIES An on-going effort was directed at bridging the gap of experience between foreign conservators and Haitian colleagues. With twin goals of maximizing a transfer of knowledge and creating opportunities to share ideas, conservators worked directly with Haitian colleagues, project managers, and Cultural Recovery Center studio assistants. Conservators were assigned to conduct assessments, to participate in the start of work, to provide basic training, to undertake treatment, and to provide support at stages throughout the project. 130 OPERATING THE HAITI CULTURAL RECOVERY CENTER NOT FOR SALE OR REPRODUCTIONConservation objectives depend upon context; after a disaster, stabilizing the greatest volume of works possible is the priority. Our conservation activities fell under four main scenarios: Large-scale assessment; Guiding or supporting large stabilization projects at the Center or on-site at institutions; Providing training; Performing advanced treatments. The response work fl ow has sequential stages. Condition assessments are performed before any treatment is undertaken. The assessment is a necessary stage which gauges the degree of damage sustained, the overall scope of work needed, and possible conservation strategies to apply. Assessments provide the data necessary for future short- and long-term interventions. Assessments have been undertaken at Holy Trinity Episcopal Cathedral, Center d'Art, Biblioth\u00e8que Nationale, Archives Nationales, Corvington Library, and the Lehmann Vodou collection. After the assessment-phase, interventions are implemented, based on identi ed priorities. Improving housing and stor- age conditions are the rst steps. They are critical because many works can remain stable under good conditions until any treatment can be undertaken in the future. Next, basic stabilization measures were undertaken. These involved surface-cleaning objects. Project teams consisting of a project manager, conservator(s), and assistants undertook the work. Stabilization measures and storage improvements have been undertaken for: the Centre d'Art, MUPANAH, the Biblioth\u00e8que Nationale, the Archives Nationales d'Ha\u00efti, and the Lehmann Vodou collection. Repair treatments are the last phase to be executed. Much of the earthquake damage to individual works of art is struc- tural, manifested as tears and punctures in paintings and works on paper, and breakage of three-dimensional objects. Surface damage frequently appears as mold and/or signi cant accretions of dirt. For more extensive treatments, when only a small percentage of treatments relative to total number of damaged works can be undertaken, priorities must be determined. The goal is to treat the most valuable examples of cultural patrimony rst. At the Center, a selection of works deemed of the highest cultural priority received further treatment involving repair and/or aesthetic re-integration. Over 100 works of art have received this higher level of treatment. With advanced structural issues, this level of treatment is extremely time-consuming; several individual works have required four to eight weeks of treatment. Believing in their abilities, I assigned the most complicated painting treatment to two gifted professional art-ists and teachers, Haitians Jean M\u00e9nard Derenoncourt and Franck Louissaint. Under the guidance of painting conservators G\u00edslad\u00f3ttir and Dominguez, they successfully treated a painting by Mario Benjamin in the Presidential Palace collection which was torn in two and had fty-eight tears. Our conservators have achieved some remarkable and dramatic results. These demonstrate that when undertaken by professionals using accepted methods of practice and stable materials, treatments can successfully recover art works believed to have been damaged beyond repair. Such stable treatments preserve cultural patrimony for future generations and prove that advanced conservation work is certainly possible in Haiti. While much has been achieved, post-disaster cultural recovery requires an investment of years of dedication. Perhaps a quarter century of work remains. A dearth of professional expertise, the continuation of out-dated practices, the absence of locally-available archival and conservation-grade materials, the humid climate, an absence of adequate storage condi-tions, and a dire need of funding indicate an uncertain future for preservation in Haiti. Now, Haitian professionals in the culture sector need to determine if it will be possible to build and sustain a corps of local preservation experts and a facility to care for Haitian cultural patrimony. I hope our early foundation-building pres-ervation efforts will take root and fl ourish in a country that so values its world-renowned art.

WALSDORF Because I am from New Orleans, Louisiana, and watched my hometown be devastated by Hurricane Katrina in August 2005, I personally know that when disasters occur, there are people who want to help families rebuild and communities get back on their feet. But when Haiti was ravaged by the earthquake, I had no idea that my role as \"mission enabler\" at the Smithsonian Institution would contribute to saving another country's cultural heritage. As the Haiti Cultural Recovery Project evolved and funding became available, memoranda of agreement were signed, travel arrangements were made, and contracts were let. On the surface, this sounds like just a bunch of paperwork, but accomplishing all of this required tremendous amounts of coordination, cooperation, collaboration, and perseverance. Speci cally, the project required extensive hands-on orchestration because there were so many participants not only from within the Smithsonian but also from around the world. Even the day-to-day processes and activities were more complex than usual because documents had to be translated from English to French and vice versa, international wires had to be processed, and currencies had to be converted. Sometimes we needed translators just so that people could have conversations to clear up misunderstandings and clarify needs. My role as financial analyst required me to do everything from negotiating contracts, to purchasing laptops and microscopes in Washington that were hand-carried to Haiti, to balancing the accounts to ensure the project was within budget. One of my biggest challenges was explaining procedures and the Haitian context to some of my colleagues who could not understand what it was like to work in a country that lacked a strong administrative infrastructure. I gained a true understanding of the phrase \"working without a net!\"The saying is true: perseverance always pays off. In the end, our effort to establish the Cultural Recovery Center became a reality, and Haiti's cultural heritage is being saved. Roberta A.

Because of the nature of the Haiti Cultural Recovery Project and the special attention it re- quired, I determined that all Haiti purchase order requirements would be channeled through me. Working on the Haiti project has been a contracting challenge. Many Friday afternoons, normally after 5 p.m., I could expect a call from Roberta Walsdorf of Richard Kurin's of ce, sometimes with Geoffrey Cavanaugh on the line as well, desperately asking for a favor to process a purchase order and to approve their contracting action so a contractor could begin work or have money wired to him. I never knew what the problem of the day would be. We had terminations of contracts, re-awarding of contracts, realigning funds, working with a contractor who had no bank account, and creating speci c clauses alerting contractors of the risks of doing business in Haiti. We devised ways of getting money to personnel when there were problems and obstacles in making transfers. We made allowances for paying contractors in advance so they could hire guides, vehicles, translators, or whatever else they needed and pay in cash\u2014not usual contracting operating procedures. We showed that the bureaucracy could adapt to an emergency situation, be fl exible and assure accountability, while at the same time achieving a very worthy mission. Working on contracts for the Haiti project was creative contracting at its nest. Carol Monahan is the Associate Director for Simpli ed Acquisitions, Of ce of Contracting & Personal Property Management and has worked at the Smithsonian for six years. My contributions to the Institution's Haiti Project were behind-the-scenes. For over a year, I have had the privilege of working on the contracting end of four key relationships on the Haiti Project; the lease for the Cultural Recovery Center, the contract to transfer funds to FOKAL to fund the Center, a contract with the Ministry of Culture for special projects, and the conservation contract to save the murals at Holy Trinity Cathedral. All four agreements had to be completed expeditiously, and with limited immediate available funding. They were all complex given the emergency situation in Haiti. Although my work didn't require me to make a personal trip to Haiti to witness the devastation and conservation efforts rst-hand, I was honored to be able to contribute, in some way, to the Institution's efforts to recover, conserve, and preserve Haiti's cultural heritage. \u2014Cindy Zarate, Supervisory Attorney, Of ce of Contracting, Smithsonian Institution 133 OPERATING THE HAITI CULTURAL RECOVERY CENTER NOT FOR SALE OR REPRODUCTIONThe Centre d'Art has long been a key institution in Haiti's creative life. It was founded at a moment in Haiti's history in the 1940s that saw a fl owering of Haitian pride and con dence in its artistic and creative impulses. The Centre d'Art then encouraged and promoted that movement. Creativity typically builds upon itself, growing and expanding insights and horizons. The earthquake did the opposite in terms of the Centre's building, studios, galleries, workshops, and collections. When I first visited, the site was in utter ruin. Most of the building had collapsed\u2014the rest a shell. The artwork was jammed into two containers parked on the street, suffering the ills of high humidity, insect infestation, mold, and other damage.CHAPTER EIGHT RECOVERING THE CENTRE D'ART COLLECTION The Centre d'Art has been at the center of the art movement in Haiti. When we saw the paintings sitting in two shipping containers, sitting under the sun for six months, it was a heartbreaking situation. \u2014Olsen Jean Julien The Centre d'Art in ruins. Photo by Corine Wegener 134 RECOVERING THE CENTRE D'ART COLLECTION NOT FOR SALE OR REPRODUCTIONNOT FOR SALE OR REPRODUCTIONThanks to the efforts of Haitian leaders in arts and culture, and key members of the Centre's board, after many months, Olsen Jean Julien, Cori Wegener, and Stephanie Hornbeck, working with Axelle Liautaud and Lorraine Mangon\u00e8s, were able to secure permission to move the containers to the Haiti Cultural Recovery Center, remove the works, inventory them, and begin their treatment. It was a landmark occasion, for by doing so the artistic leg-acy of more than sixty years would be saved. Thanks also to the efforts of ICCROM's Aparna Tandon, and UNESCO's Elke Selter, engineering troops from Japan who were part of the U.N. military force, MINUSTAH, were mobilized to bring to the Centre d'Art site heavy equipment. They worked closely with the conservators to dig through the rub-ble and remove another 150 items or so that had sat in the rubble for some seven months. Their removal provided an excellent training opportunity for more than two dozen Haitian trainees who worked on the site rescue project. The long process of treating the collection was accomplished by an excellent team of Centre d'Art staff and artists led by Marie-Lucie Vendryes, who had served as a former Director of MUPANAH, the National Museum. They did a superb job, tracking, treating, and housing a collection that otherwise would have receded to mere memory. Now, because of their efforts, it is available for future generations to enjoy, to educate, and to inspire. My rst reaction was to save the paintings. \u2014Marise Desrosiers NOT FOR SALE OR REPRODUCTIONPRESERVING THE CENTRE D'ART COLLECTION STEPHANIE HORNBECK The work undertaken to recover, stabilize, and treat the Centre d'Art collection of nearly 5,000 paintings, sculpture, and works on paper represents the largest conservation effort undertaken by the Cultural Recovery Center. All of the Center's permanent staff, fteen conservators, two teams of six people each, and all twenty-six of the ICCROM training course participants would share in preserving this collection. Its dramatic earthquake story was emblematic of our cultural recovery efforts as a whole. After the collapse of the Centre d'Art's gingerbread building in the earthquake, staff and artists recovered what art and sculpture they could from the rubble and stored it in two large metal containers on the street and protected by armed guards until late August 2010. By visiting the Centre site several times from June onward and conducting assessments of conditions in the containers, I noted the growth of mold and measured the humidity with a data-logger at one point. The humidity reached eighty-eight percent putting the collection at grave risk. The Centre d'Art's board understood that storage of the collection in non-acclimatized hot metal containers was not ideal. As trust was gained in our project's efforts, steps were taken to move the collection to the Haiti Cultural Recovery Center for stabilization. A basic methodology to process the collection involved these goals: Recover as many works as possible; Stabilize them via dry-cleaning and treatment for mold; Catalogue them; Create written and photographic records that can eventually be incorporated into the Centre d'Art's collection records; Store the works in a stable environment. The methodology was tested in two case studies during the three-week ICCROM course on rst aid intervention and collections management held in August 2010. One study involved on-site recovery of works still remaining in the rubble and one involved the works of art in the containers. For the site work, Elke Selter, Cultural Of cer at UNESCO in Haiti, arranged for a MINUSTAH (United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti) corps of engineers\u2014Japanese U.N. troops\u2014to use a bulldozer and front-loader to search for works of art buried in the rubble. This marked the rst time in Haiti that U.N. troops had joined with professional conservators in a system- atic way to use heavy equipment to help recover cultural material. Over a two-day period, the conservators, Haitian participants in the ICCROM course, and the troops rescued approximately 150 works of art from the rubble. A number of these were badly damaged by active termite infestation and had to be discarded, yet a surprising number were saved. The container case study was undertaken in the Haiti Cultural Recovery Center's courtyard in Bourdon and at indoor work stations in the climate controlled building. At the end of the course, the processing protocol and three document templates were presented to project man-ager Marie-Lucie Vendryes to guide her work with a team of seven assistants. Over the next six months they would focus on processing the roughly 4,500 paintings and works on paper in the collection. I would later oversee the processing of the iron sculpture collection, working with object conservator Ana\u00efs Gailhbaud and four Annette Augustin among others (in yellow headgear) excavate rubble at the Center d'Art site.

Photo by Aparna TandonThe Centre d'Art's collection of iron sculpture exhibits breadth in the number of artists represented and depth within the oeuvre of individual artists. The collection includes signi cant works of art fabricated by the founding father of Haitian ironwork sculpture, Georges Liautaud, as well as later masters Murat Brierre, Serge Jolimeau, the Louisjuste brothers, and Damien Paul, among others. Post-earthquake, the collection numbers 337 pieces and includes both fer d\u00e9coup\u00e9 (cut iron sheet metal) and wrought iron sculptures. Liautaud's work marked the beginning of a new era of sculpture in Haiti, one which re-purposed iron metal of industrial origin to illustrate Vodou and Christian iconography, as well as secular gural and fl oral motifs. In the nearly seventy years since their rst fabrication, fer d\u00e9coup\u00e9 sculpture has come to embody a quintessentially Haitian art form. A selection of the most damaged art works among the most culturally important received further conservation treatment. Art historian Mireille J\u00e9r\u00f4me and collector Axelle Liautaud, members of the Centre d'Art board, prioritized the works by cultural importance. The primary goal of conservation treatment for the iron objects involved stabilization by removing surface dirt and reducing aggressive corrosion. Following a protocol developed by metals conservator Paul Jett, Head of Conservation, Freer and Sackler Galleries, Smithsonian Institution, object conservators Gailhbaud, Renee Jolly, Teresa Myers, and Martha Singer treated twenty- ve sculptures, while also guiding assistants in the work. Paper conservator Bernard Colla treated nineteen works on paper for tears and mold. Painting conservators Krist\u00edn G\u00edslad\u00f3ttir, Viviana Franck Louissaint, would mend dramatic structural tears to painted canvases and deal with the breakage of masonite panels. The successful recovery and preservation of the Centre d'Art collection more than any other project best represents the Haiti Cultural Recovery Project core mission. It would span nearly the entire eighteen-month timeframe and involve the greatest number of hands. 138 RECOVERING THE CENTRE D'ART COLLECTION NOT FOR SALE OR REPRODUCTIONNOT FOR SALE OR REPRODUCTIONNOT FOR SALE OR REPRODUCTIONFROM SAFETY TO PRESERVATION AXELLE LIAUTAUD We knew the health of the Centre d'Art collection was in jeopardy sitting in the two containers in front of our col- lapsed building and baking for months in sun's heat\u2014and we had to do something to save it. Given the crisis in gov-ernance and leadership following the deaths of key people, Lorraine Mangon\u00e8s and I took responsibility in the absence of a fully operational board of nally, seven months after the earthquake, arranging treatment by the Haiti Cultural Recovery Project. Our agreement with the Smithsonian specified that the staff of the Cultural Recovery Center would: transport the containers to the Cultural Recovery Center site; open them in the presence of board members and a lawyer; take ev- ery step necessary to inventory clean and secure the art; return it to the possession of the Centre d'Art on demand.Through this extremely dif cult situation, during which the collection was in constant danger of disappearing, exposed to the elements and the thieves, we had been promised help by various foreign private and public insti- tutions. None of it ever materialized except for the Cultural Recovery Center. The great cultural and historical treasure of the Centre d'Art could have been lost. The Centre d'Art is still facing a long and hard road but without the intervention of the Smithsonian and its partners, all that might be left today would be a plaque bearing the words \"in memoriam.\" [Left] Mireille P\u00e9rodin J\u00e9r\u00f4me Center d'Art collection for treatment.

Photos by Stephanie Hornbeck 141 RECOVERING THE CENTRE D'ART COLLECTION NOT FOR SALE OR REPRODUCTIONTHE CENTRE D'ART: RESCUING WORKS OF ART MARIE-LUCIE VENDRYES The Centre d'Art collapsed in the earthquake and its rich collection of works of art ended up in the rubble. It took the almost heroic intervention of two employees, Marise Desrosiers and Henry Celestin, who rescued materials and it is to their credit that the collection is today preserved. Paintings, sculpture and archival documents were saved, placed in two containers parked outside the ruined building. The Haiti Cultural Recovery Project, developed in conjunction with the Smithsonian and the Haitian Ministry of Culture and Communication, sought to save this cultural material. The containers were transported to the Haiti Cultural Recovery Center where the art work and documents were removed from the containers, cleaned and treated. The collection and the Centre d'Art itself represented a key and vital force in Haitian culture. The Centre d'Art had been founded in 1944 at a time of intellectual foment when questions about Haitian identity had come to the fore. An indigenous literary movement had turned to the rural world to celebrate its beauty, the pleasure of working in the elds, and gratitude to a tropical nature that feeds her children. Haitian art started to follow the same route. At the time, an American, Dewitt Peters, came to teach English at the Haitian-American Institute of Port-au-Prince. Sensitive to the debates about national identity, and himself a painter, he joined George Ramponneau, P\u00e9tion Savain, Lucien Price, Luce Turnier, Antonio Joseph, and others in an artistic enterprise. Peters leased a building and invited visual artists from around the country to join them. Artists engaged in a rich artistic dialogue about lines, shapes, colors, light, and perspectives, fostering exchanges with Cuban, American, Puerto Rican and Italian artists, and creating works that impressed such cultural gures as Andr\u00e9 Malraux who came to Haiti in 1946. Peters provided art supplies and access to new markets for Haitian artists like Hector Hyppolite and Philom\u00e9 Obin, who were considered \"na\u00efve\" and were unknown to broader audiences. This was a period of democratization of art in Haiti, and its produce was increasingly marketed and promoted. The Centre d'Art fl ourished. 142 RECOVERING THE CENTRE D'ART COLLECTION NOT FOR SALE OR REPRODUCTIONDebates ensued about the question of what constituted Haitian folk art, naivety and so on, and some Haitian artists did not want to be associated with the Centre. Nonetheless, the Centre's reputation as the vibrant force in Haitian art grew. Collectors sought works of its artists. Over time, the Centre d'Art established a collection, a permanent one of great heritage value, and a temporary one of works for sale. These provided an ongoing source of income. As the Centre has always worked in a spirit of encounter and exchange, some artists had their studios in the building and many would let their works be displayed and sold there. As a result, thousands of works of art accumulated at the Centre d'Art. The earthquake buried about ten to twenty percent of the paintings that had been in the building. The vast majority were saved by Marise and Henry. Excavations at the site aided by MINUSTAH troops and heavy equipment saved another 150 or so. The corpus saved was sub-ject to our conservation project. Our job was to identify, document, clean, and store these art works in good conditions. We had to plan the work, set a timeline, create a team, de ne the tasks, and as needed distribute them fairly\u2014as some of the artists asked for their paintings to be returned. The project was executed according to the following procedures: \u0081 The works were taken out of the containers, and then, using a brush, were dusted to remove the residue from the rubble. \u0081 Works were then vacuumed. Painted surfaces were then cleaned with a sponge to remove ne dust. For works on paper, a soft bristle brush and grated white gum were used. \u0081 Each object was assigned an inventory number. Three les were opened on each\u2014an inventory record, a condition report, and photographic documentation. Works were sent to the photography room, photographed with their assigned number and then sent to storage. \u0081 Data on the inventory record was veri ed and a storage location noted. \u0081 Climate conditions for storage were checked to ensure conservation standards are met. \u0081 The inventory records were organized and sorted and data entered into a record book. \u0081 The inventory records were computerized and photographs integrated for each object to provide a digital record. Every day the team treated thirty to fty works, according to this procedure. By March 15, 2011, we had treated some 4,600 works. The most damaged works were placed in quarantine for special treatment, typically for mold. All were securely stored at the Haiti Cultural Recovery Center. They represent an important chapter in the history of Haitian art, and await full res-toration for future generations. Marie-Lucie Vendryes has a Masters Degree in Museum Studies.

We treated a number of paintings to the point of stabilization. There were so many badly damaged works in need of immediate care that the time-consuming cosmetic work was left to be done at a later date. Much of our time there was focused around the collection from the Centre d'Art.Thousands of paintings had already been recovered by the Haitian staff under the direction of Marie-Lucie Vendryes. The paintings had condition assessments, were photographed, had all received an initial cleaning, and were safely stored on racks in the Center. The careful and organized manner in which the staff worked to recover these paintings was a striking contrast to the surrounding chaos outside of the Center's gates. Marie-Chantal and I were responsible for treating hundreds of mold-damaged paintings. These paintings were quarantined from non-moldy works and sprayed individually to inhibit further mold growth. The paintings remained isolated until the mold was clearly arrested. In writing my reports to the institutions that sent me to Haiti I felt a sad irony when recom- mending better housing for paintings and works of art when over a million people in Port-au-Prince were still living in tents ten months after the earthquake. As an individual, it is dif cult to see the contribution one is making. While I was in Haiti my incremental progress felt futile in the midst of such destruction. It is indeed heartening to know of the remarkable progress a little over a year after the recovery began and to see the cumulative effects of so many volun-teer hours, each adding a small piece to the bigger picture.

The murals were a beauti- ful, complex representation of Haitian identity, a treasure of Port-au-Prince, and a familiar part of a congregation's and a community's religious life. CHAPTER NINE SAVING THE MURALS AT HOLY TRINITY CATHEDRAL I am right now at the Holy Trinity site with Viviana, two assistants, and seven CRC staff members (Mentor, Yanick, Ulrick, Erickson, Jonas, Silvestre, and Petit Frere our security agent on site). We are doing the cleaning and making the preparations to start the project. It's a great experience for every one of us. We are thinking about our loved ones and thanking everyone who shares our dreams to save as much as we can from our cultural heritage. This is for me one of the best ways to remember the event of January 12, 2010. \u2014Olsen Jean Julien, on the one-year anniversary of the earthquake The conservation team lead by Viviana Dominguez and Rosa Lowinger work on scaffolding built by Patrick Vilaire and his team in order to save the Last Supper and Baptism murals at the Holy Trinity Episcopal Cathedral. Photo by Stephanie Hornbeck SAVING THE MURALS AT HOLY TRINITY CATHEDRAL 146 NOT FOR SALE OR REPRODUCTIONNOT FOR SALE OR REPRODUCTIONTHE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE HOLY TRINITY MURALS PATRICK DELATOUR In 1815 Henri Christophe, ruler of the newly independent nation of Haiti, wrote to William Wilberforce, a Christian Evangelical and Britain's strongest advocate for the abolition of slav- ery, asking his advice about instituting a national prayer. Wilberforce suggested Christophe adopt the Anglican liturgy of the Church of England. Wilberforce also advised and aided Christophe in his effort to create a new educational system for Haiti as both envisioned an ideal, Black-ruled, divinely-inspired free society. Anglican infl uence was short-lived with Christophe's death in 1820, but emerged four decades later when Haiti was viewed as a promised land for Black Americans beset by slavery and the Civil War. James Theodore Holly, an African American priest of the Episcopal Church\u2014the American branch of Anglicanism\u2014 was a staunch abolitionist. In 1861 he led a mission of 110 men, women, and children from New Haven, Connecticut to Haiti. More than forty died within the year from yellow fever and malaria, but Holly persevered. He became a citizen of Haiti and built the rst church. In 1865 he gained nancial support for the Episcopal mission in Haiti, and in 1874 became Episcopal Bishop of Haiti. The rst church burnt in 1866. It was rebuilt, and over the next half-century was burnt and rebuilt several times, the sixth and last time as a Cathedral in 1924. Port-au-Prince celebrated its bicentennial in 1949, and on the occasion artists associated with the Centre d'Art\u2014Philom\u00e9 Obin, Pr\u00e9f\u00e8te Duffaut\u2014began to paint larger-than-life scenes of the New Testament on the walls of the Cathedral. Fourteen murals were completed in 1950 and 1951. The biblical scenes highlighted the Ascension, the Last Supper, and other episodes in the life of Christ. Jesus and his Apostles, and their families were represented in the blackness of the original peoples of the Galilee and in obvious kinship with the people of Haiti. 148 SAVING THE MURALS AT HOLY TRINITY CATHEDRAL NOT FOR SALE OR REPRODUCTIONThe murals incorporated numerous symbols of Vodou and depicted Haiti's two most important pilgrimage sites of Saut d'eau and Souvenance. The 'Wall' as it was called, became well known and almost mythic in character, as an iconic representation of Haitian identity. Over the years, Holy Trinity also acquired a reputation as the rst temple of sacred music, served by its exceptional Philharmonic Orchestra. Its boys' choir became renowned and its mu-sic lls the air of the capital. Holy Trinity operated a music school, grade school, high school and college, and vocational training school. It also had a museum\u2014the Museum of Haitian Art of the College of St. Pierre. All were severely damaged or completely destroyed in the earthquake. The Smithsonian and other cultural organizations focused on saving the three surviving mu- rals for two reasons, one very speci c, the other more profound. The rst was a very practical one\u2014the three murals had emerged mainly intact after the disaster but were now vulnerable in being exposed to the elements. They had to be saved or else they would be lost. The sec-ond reason relates to the more symbolic 150 years of history and memory that the Episcopal Church in Haiti represents. That presence, from the very beginning, is marked by the integra-tion of the church into the Haitian experience, often against the odds. That is represented by the murals, but also by the composition of its large congregation, and its contributions to Haitian education and music. In a word, the church is part and parcel of Haiti's national culture, and the \"Wall\" the expressive \"tip of the iceberg\" of a presence in Haitian society that includes health care centers, agricultural training programs, educational institutions, libraries, a museum, youth groups, and major programs for the empowerment of women. So the act of recovering the murals is part of a larger act of community and national recovery.Plans are now underway to rebuild the Holy Trinity Cathedral and the entire complex\u2014schools, concert hall, and museum in a much more integrated way, and one that strongly contributes to the rebuilding of the central part of the capital city around the National Palace and the Champs de Mars. As part of that campus, the Episcopal Church has decided to establish a his-toric site in memory of earthquake victims. This might feature a memorial garden hosting the restored murals. Haitians would naturally visit to connect to their heritage and more recent history, but foreign visitors too would make a new pilgrimage to the \"Wall,\" to understand the Haitian experience. And just as the restoration of the Citadel Henry as a symbol of national identity and world heritage that instructed all about the struggle for independence and freedom gave birth to ISPAN (Institute for the Protection of National Heritage), the rescue of the \"Wall\" is expected to generate a permanent organization responsible for valued items and collections of Haitian cultural heritage.

Photo by Krist\u00edn G\u00edslad\u00f3ttirMy mural in the new Cathedral will be better than the old ones! \u2014Pr\u00e9f\u00e8te Duffaut 149 SAVING THE MURALS AT HOLY TRINITY CATHEDRAL NOT FOR SALE OR REPRODUCTIONThe challenges of taking the three surviving murals down off of the listing, cracking walls of the ruined Cathedral were legion. Thanks to Patrick Vilaire, his quickly installed scaffolding and tarping provided a bit of stability and protection. Y et, time after time visiting the murals I noticed more fading paint, more water damage, and another crack or two in the wall. I worried that the walls would simply fall, or be blown down by the hefty gust of a tropical storm. Clearly we had to get them down\u2014but would the mural surface separate from the unstable, rough, varie-gated substrate? I feared that as we tried to take down fragments in large sections, they would break apart into small pebbles. Stephanie Hornbeck's decision to bring in world-class expert conservators Viviana Dominguez and Rosa Lowinger was the correct one. Reverend Stephen Davenport, a long-time tireless worker for Haiti and the Episcopal Church, helped pave the way. I had to explain what we intended to do to the Episcopal Church's Presiding Bishop Katharine Jefferts Schori in New Y ork. I did so with some trepidation, knowing that we had to try, and hoped to succeed, yet unable to absolutely guarantee success. During the same period, of cials of the Episcopal Church announced a world-wide campaign to rebuild the Cathedral and campus complex. They were counting on the Haiti Cultural Recovery Project to save the murals so they could be reassembled and then reinstalled\u2014either into the walls of a rebuilt cathedral, or as free standing elements of a new cathedral, or as the key elements of an outdoor memorial garden. We began studies early on, and undertook various measures, like having engineers design and Patrick Vilaire build a sturdier, more supportive second scaffolding. Olsen Jean Julien secured the con dence and permission of Bishop Duracin and local of cials. It wasn't until Rosa and Viviana had a de nitive plan and did the preparatory work that we were ready to begin. That day, poignantly, was January 12, 2011 , the rst anniversary of the earthquake. As Olsen wrote to us in an e-mail, he was at the murals with a number of Center staff. They, and by extension of empathy, we, all understood the importance of the moment. About to begin, we were playing a role in saving one of Haiti's true treasures. Olsen also wrote a word of thanks. \"We are thanking you Stephanie, Cori, and Richard for your leadership and your humanity. We are thanking all the conservators who came to help. What you have done and are still doing in this country is priceless and unforgettable.\" Indeed, this was, despite any bureaucratic categorization, a deeply humanitarian project\u2014one that recognized and respected the humanity of the Haitian people. We were all proud\u2014not loudly or exuberantly proud, but quietly proud, with a sense of satisfaction that we had done the right thing in pursuing the project in partner-ship with our Haitian colleagues and friends. The project to take down the murals contin- ued for months and required the daily work of Haitian artists, technicians, carpenters, and others. It required the continual attention and coopera-tion of the leadership of the Holy Trinity Episcopal Cathedral. The Smithsonian's Materials Conservation Institute and the Getty Conservation Program helped out. It was all done under the expert knowledge and steady hands of Viviana and Rosa, who were physically and technically immersed in it. For the Haitian technical assistants, artists, carpenters, laborers, and security staff, it was hard, but meaningful work, as Junior Nor\u00e9lus called it, \"the best experience of my career.\" Finally, as the project neared the end of the take- down phase in May 2011, I received an e-mail from Stephanie with an attached image le\u2014which I imme- diately sent around to Cori Wegener, Rachel Goslins, Marsha Semmel, Charlotte St. Martin, Bill Hillman, Secretary Clough, and others who had been so involved and supportive of the project. Attached please nd the LAST wall painting fragment at St. Trinity, the face of Christ. Viviana and team successfully lifted it an hour later. Stephanie It had been quite a journey.

Photo by Viviana Dominguez 151 SAVING THE MURALS AT HOLY TRINITY CATHEDRAL NOT FOR SALE OR REPRODUCTIONNOT FOR SALE OR REPRODUCTIONSAVING THE MURALS STEPHANIE HORNBECK On my second day in Haiti, I visited the nearly-destroyed site of the world-renowned wall paintings at Holy Trinity Episcopal Cathedral with Olsen Jean Julien and Corine Wegener. It was evident that specialized conservation expertise was required to save the extant murals by protecting the paint layer and then lifting sections of the murals from the unstable walls. The earthquake had destroyed eleven of the fourteen paintings in the mural cycle of New Testament images, painted in 1950-51 by master artists associated with the Centre d'Art. Three murals, Philom\u00e9 Obin's Last Supper, Christ , and Pr\u00e9f\u00e8te Duffaut's Nativity Procession, though badly damaged, survived the earthquake. The great cultural value of the murals and their extreme vulnerability required commencement of work within weeks of the opening of the Cultural Recovery Center. The extant murals had serious and dramatic con-servation issues. The three walls with Obin's murals were structurally unstable; large ssures were present across the murals; sections were vulnerable to complete collapse. The wall for the Bazile mural appeared more structurally sound. The wall with the Duffaut was completely exposed, as, the roof above it had collapsed. In addition, the technique of the murals rendered them vulnerable. These were not painted in a fresco technique, where the cured lime-plaster bonds with the paint layer to afford greater stability. They were painted in a very thin egg tempera layer over a lime mortar-based prepara-tion layer only millimeters-thick. Further, exposure to extreme environmental conditions made it imperative that treatment begin. Haiti's tropical climate includes an annual rainy season which lasts from June to October, when the region experiences heavy rains and sometimes tropical storms and hurricanes. Patrick Vilaire had quickly and valiantly built a scaffold structure that helped shore up the list-ing transept wall hosting the Baptism and Last Supper murals. A tarp offered some protection from the rain. But given the near-complete collapse of the Cathedral roof, the murals were still well-exposed to the elements. Heavy rains penetrated and widened ssures and extracted soluble salts which were deposited on the painted surface as white streaks, most notably down the center of the Christ gure, seated in the Last Supper mural. When in June 2010 Zach\u00e9 Duracin, Archbishop of the Episcopal Church of Haiti, granted his formal permission to work on the murals both on-site and at the Cultural Recovery Center, the Church became one of our rst collaborators for the Haiti Cultural Recovery Project. Shortly thereafter, two structural engineers, Dr. Steeve Ambroise and Marcel Dominique, assessed the structure and proposed to stabilize the walls and distribute the weight of the roof with a wood scaffolding network. Once again we called on Patrick Vilaire and his team to build the scaffolding and roofs designed by the engineers. This structure would support the walls and offer some added protection from the elements until conservation work could be completed. The successful removal of wall paintings from their architectural context requires hybrid con- servation skills, involving consideration of both the paintings and the walls. I prepared a detailed scope of work describing the need for a comprehensive assessment and steps for treatment and removal. We were fortunate to nd highly skilled collaborators in painting conservator Viviana Dominguez and architectural materials conservator Rosa Lowinger. They had the expertise, experience, and ability to address a complex conservation project that had challenges at every step in the process. Viviana and Rosa also guided four assistants in the work, Junior Nor\u00e9lus, Franck Fontain, Wanglish Michel, and Junior Racine. In keeping with all conservation activities at the Center, an education focus involved teaching the assistants mu-ral conservation techniques. The efforts of \"Equipe Ste. Trinit\u00e9,\" as I thought of the team of six, would successfully preserve the project's most important example of built cultural heritage.

Six months had passed since the earthquake and we had been invited down to Port-au-Prince by our col-league Stephanie Hornbeck, Chief Conservator for the Haiti Cultural Recovery Center. We are conservators of architecture and mural paintings who had worked extensively together in the past and Stephanie had asked us to fl y down and assess three murals that had survived the collapse of the Cathedral to determine what, if anything, could be done to safely remove them from the precarious walls on which they were painted. At the time of the invitation, neither of us knew anything about Holy Trinity Cathedral. In truth, we knew very little about Haitian art and culture. We did not know, for example, that the Cathedral itself was the seat of an Episcopal archdiocese founded by African American abolitionists or that it was a lovely 1920's building built of limestone rubble walls. We knew that the building had been decorated with energetic color-saturated New Testament scenes, but neither of us could begin to fathom the importance of these wall paintings within Haitian artistic tradition or, more importantly, the country's religious life. As we prepared for our trip in Miami, we learned that these murals held a deep spiritual meaning to Haitians because they used local people and settings to illustrate the life of Christ. This went well beyond the skin color of the gures depicted in the paintings. For example, in the painting Nativity by Rigaud Benoit, tropical palm trees, a thatched roof building, baskets of pineapple, and a waterfall with the distinct appearance of a local pilgrimage site called Saut d'Eau frame baby Jesus. In Wedding at Cana, artist Wilson Bigaud set the miracle of turning water into wine in a Haitian hilltop village, complete with musicians playing conga drums and fl utes of local origin. When we arrived at the roofless open plaza that had once been the nave of Holy Trinity Cathedral, both Benoit's and Bigaud's murals had been reduced to rubble. Gone also were paintings Annunciation, Temptation of the Lord, and Cruci xion, not to mention the building's walls, roof, and pillars. Only three murals\u2014Castera Bazile's Baptism, Duffaut's Native Procession, and Philom\u00e9 Obin's three-walled Last Supper\u2014clung precariously to walls that looked about as stable as the piles of debris that surrounded them. Doused by rain and baked by the sun for six months, the paintings were starting to fade and powder. They had to come down immediately. The question was how to do it without destroying them. That rst day we furiously measured, surveyed and photographed hoping to come up with an answer. In the evening we sat on the porch of the house we shared with Stephanie, and voiced our worries. Could the murals really come down safely? Should they be done by removing the paint layer alone or should one use the broken fragments themselves as the means of separa-tion? What size fragment could be safely removed? How would it be brought down? What sort of facing should protect the paint layers? How could one stabilize the powdering paint enough to keep it from sticking when we removed the facing? In 1994, we had worked together on earthquake salvage in Los Angeles, but the removal of these murals required us to gure out not only how to get the pieces down but how to store them in conditions of extreme humidity and even how to bring all of our materials to the site. For the three days we were in Haiti we went back and forth between excitement and anxiety, doubt and con dence. This was clearly the project of a lifetime. But were we going to come up with a way to make it happen? Not long after we returned to Miami and sent in our original assessment and recommenda- tions we got a call from Richard Kurin. \"We want you to take the work on,\" he said. \"We believe that you already know the project and are therefore the most quali ed to tackle it.\" Anxiety then shifted to terror. Could we really do this? Had we been too sure of ourselves, too driven by conservator's bravado? Either way, we began to fl esh out our plan. 154 SAVING THE MURALS AT HOLY TRINITY CATHEDRAL NOT FOR SALE OR REPRODUCTION[Upper] Junior Racine compares his drawing with the physical condition of the mural.

Photo by Viviana Dominguez 155 SAVING THE MURALS AT HOLY TRINITY CATHEDRAL NOT FOR SALE OR REPRODUCTIONThe rst thing we did was to decide de nitively to remove the pieces by the stacco method, that is, together with their mortar render. Because the fragments were conveniently broken into mostly-manageable pieces, it seemed safer to proceed this way than try to do the gargan-tuan and risky job of trying to separate the paint layer from the backing. We devised a system for safely bringing the fragments down and made a plan to import all our tools and practically all of our materials. We would require occasional support from Patrick Vilaire, an engineer who had installed shoring on the walls shortly after the earth-quake, and daily full-time assistance from four technicians identi ed by the Haiti Cultural Recovery Center. We would train these assistants and they, in turn, would work both under our supervision and on their own between our trips to Haiti. With help from the Getty Conservation Institute's scienti c division, and the Smithsonian's Museum Conservation Institute, we were able to determine that the murals were painted in egg tempera on a basic lime and gypsum mortar base that ranged in thickness from one-quarter of an inch to one inch. (The paint type was later con rmed by Pr\u00e9f\u00e8te Duffaut in a personal communication with Viviana.) This allowed us to devise a protocol that would begin with dry cleaning and consolidation of the paint surface and would be followed by full docu-mentation with drawings and photographs, dry brushing and spot poulticing of salts that had begun to crystallize on certain surfaces, facing with gauze and a series of conservation-grade resins, localized cutting to make fragments manageable, then keying of the fragments to the drawings, and their removal, storage, and safe transport. Viviana made a brief visit to the site in October to oversee Vilaire's installation of more stable and usable scaffolding. She also brought back small mural fragments which we used for test-ing materials and treatment techniques. Finally, it was time to plunge into the site work. We packed enormous suitcases with every material we could think of using and headed to Haiti. By then it was January 2011, a year after the earthquake. The murals had survived the hurricane season, but though they were nominally protected with tarps and makeshift tin roo ng, time was taking its toll on the paint surface. Colors had visibly faded in places. In others, salts had crystallized further. Meanwhile, a cholera epidemic threatened to thwart the entire venture. We added chlorine sanitary wipes and antibiotics to our arsenal of materials and forged onward. In reality, there were so many extenuating circumstances to working in Haiti\u2014for example, we could not travel through the city on our own, we had only partial phone service and sometimes no running water or electricity at the site\u2014that we had no idea whether our time estimates would prove to be remotely accurate. We thought they were, but we were not sure. Nonetheless, in order to maximize our onsite supervision time we came up with a plan for Viviana, as the wall paintings conservator, to be the primary site supervisor, for Rosa to super-vise intermittently, and for both conservators to overlap on site when a joint troubleshooting session was needed. We relied on constant instant messaging and e-mailing to communicate questions back and forth between Miami and the Holy Trinity site, as well as on Stephanie's willingness to haul mortar, gauze, and adhesives down to Port-au-Prince. The process of conservation, even in the best of settings, is like walking through a labyrinth. You come up with a plan and you move along it until you hit a dead end. You see the end in sight, and then something pops up that makes you go back two steps and then forward again to get around the obstacle. At Holy Trinity this was the rule rather than the exception. We decided that the only way to go about this was to tackle that which could be dealt with rst. NOT FOR SALE OR REPRODUCTIONFor the murals this rst step consisted of cleaning and consolidation of the powdering paint layer. Viviana began the process with the assistants on her rst site visit. Yet even during this rst relatively simple process we could see problems arising. There was, for example, an issue of communication with our assistants and the two carpenters who were on site to build the wood storage trays that would hold removed mural fragments and address ongoing needs for scaffold con guration. The two artists who began working with us spoke nominal English. Needless to say, we spoke no Krey\u00f2l. During our initial interactions, we sensed a certain re-luctance or lethargy. We could not tell whether this was a matter of indifference to the work before us or a resistance to get on board with our processes. The artists seemed skeptical at times and indifferent at others. They joked among themselves and seemed to be having a good time, but sometimes we surmised that the task of removing murals from a ruined cathedral was just not all that important to them in light of all the devastation they lived with. As proj-ects go, this one required constant alertness to things going wrong, and a constant tweaking of the protocols. Our adjustments must have been frustrating, if not downright confounding. An example: we decided to use the cracks caused by the earthquake as the natural border be- tween fragments and try to keep pieces as whole as possible. Then we would bring the pieces down and nd them dif cult to safely fl ip face up. In other cases we would get a fragment almost fully separated from the wall only to hit a place where it was so tightly attached to a cinderblock repair in the wall that we had to stop and make an additional cut. We would nd a repair mix that worked and a company to donate the material, only to nd that we could not get the materials to Port-au-Prince when we ran out. As each fragment was brushed of dirt, photographed, labeled, keyed to a drawing, faced with cheesecloth, shored with wood strips, cut at the edges, chiseled from behind, lifted by three or four people, laid onto a cardboard tray, walked down the scaffolding by two or three assistants, laid down on a makeshift table in our lean-to workspace, injected with mortar or adhesive, then turned, cleaned of its wooden strips and facing, photographed, and placed into its long-term wooden storage trays, and - nally transported to the Cultural Recovery Center under Stephanie's gracious supervision, our process would go through several permutations. Nonetheless, despite the heat, humidity, mosquitoes, and unforeseen curve balls like transit strikes, and a summer airline embargo on packages, our team managed to remove the murals from the walls of the Cathedral. First Native Procession came down, then Baptism, and nally the Last Supper. In the end, we removed 142 fragments in all, ranging in size from two to four foot square. In the process we did become a true team. Viviana was affectionately called \"Captain Dominguez\" by Olsen indicating her firm leadership. Our conservation assistants\u2014Junior Nor\u00e9lus, Junior Racine, Frankie Fontain, and Michel Wanglish proved to be a dedicated, hard working, pro cient \"dream team.\" Patrick Vilaire and his carpenters Jean Marie Derazin, Snyder Clerg\u00e9, and Andrice Felix worked diligently to support the removal. The staff of the Center, the drivers, even the guards all contributed.

Photos by Stephanie Hornbeck, Viviana Dominguez, and \u00c9lo\u00efse Paquette NOT FOR SALE OR REPRODUCTIONThe mural fragments were carefully transported to the Haiti Cultural Recovery Center where we set up an outdoor processing operation to further stabilize each and every fragment by treating them front and back. The plan is to re-assemble the fragments sometime in the future when the Holy Trinity Episcopal Cathedral complex is rebuilt\u2014and our maps, diagrams, and photographs, will provide the de nitive guide for doing so. There are debates over how to re-install the re-assembled murals\u2014should they be incorporated into the walls of a new church or left free-standing as the icons of a memorial garden? Should they be indoors or outdoors with some form of climate protection? There are dozens of issues to resolve about the ef cacy of any plan, but that just goes with the territory of this sort of conservation\u2014because more than preserving a material object, one is helping a people and a nation keep its heritage alive.

We met at the Cultural Recovery Center to get acquainted with Viviana Dominguez, a conservator of wall paintings and a rm leader. Our job was to rescue the murals from the walls of the Holy Trinity Episcopal Cathedral. Originally a team of ve, we were joined by others. From day one, we started to carefully clean the wall. Over the course of the project's rst phase, we had to apply gum Arabic to consolidate or bind the paint. We had to make drawings of the wall murals, being as accurate as possible, and then make a grid so we could give codes to different fragments and understand how the whole mural t together. The second phase began with protecting the wall using gauze, Paraolid B-72, and small pieces of wood to form a grid to give each fragment strength when we removed it. Following this preparation, Rosa Lowinger, the architectural materials conservator, came with specially made chisels to remove the fragments. We had to do this carefully, taking into account the consider- able weight of the fragments. We prepared cardboard trays with sponge to hold the fragments. We then walked the frag- ments down the scaffold, put the fragments on a table, and applied mortar to the pieces to keep them rm. We then overturned the fragments, put them in wooden trays, photographed them, and readied them for transport to the Cultural Recovery Center. Once there, the pieces of wood and facing material were removed, cracks were glued, and fragments cleaned with acetone so they could nally be stored. For me it was incredible to be able to remove a wall mural. As an artist, I thought at the beginning that this was an impossible thing to do. But it was done well, thanks to the con-servators, the assistants, the carpenters, and the whole Cultural Recovery Center team. Saving the murals and being involved in the rescue of the cultural heritage of my country, is the best experience of my career.

Haitians walking by looked heartbro- ken. All 14 murals had been internation-ally treasured. Painted in the early 1950s during an artistic renaissance here, they depicted biblical scenes from a proud, lo-cal point of view: with Jesus carrying a Haitian flag as he ascended to heaven; and a last supper that, unlike some fa-mous depictions, does not portray Judas with darker skin than the other disciples. \"All of this was painted from a Haitian perspective,\" said the Rev. David C\u00e9sar, the church's main priest and its music school director. He marveled at the image mi-raculously still standing: Judas, with the white beard and wavy white hair often as-signed to God himself. It was his favorite mural, he said, and now, it is being saved. In a partnership between the Episcopal Church and the Smithsonian, all three surviving murals are being stabilized and carefully taken to a climate-controlled warehouse in Haiti where they will be protected until they can be redisplayed in a new home. The painstaking 18-month project began in the fall, with conservators ana-lyzing how the paintings were bound to the walls (weak mortar) and the materials that were used to paint them (egg tem-pera). It was clear that they were fragile. A portion of one painting near the for-mer altar faded to abstraction during the rainy season. The other collapsed murals seemed to disappear. Perhaps portions were pul-verized by the earthquake; perhaps some were stolen. But when conservators and Haitian art students separated the frag-ments from the rubble, they found only tiny pieces, usually the size of a hand or smaller, that could not be reassembled. \"We have only about 10 percent of the 11 murals that fell,\" said Stephanie Hornbeck, the chief conservator with the Smithsonian, whose master's degree fo-cused on Haitian art. \"When you have that little left, there's nothing you can do.\" For the murals still standing, she said experts had higher hopes and immediate plans. For the past several weeks, Haitian workers in what was once the sanctuary have been carefully constructing scaffold-ing. A web of wooden beams now holds up tin and vinyl to protect the paintings, supporting both the art and the workers trying to carefully chisel it away. Simply hearing hammers and seeing scaffolding\u2014what smiles they bring here in a city where reconstruction is practi-cally non-existent. No less soothing is the classical music\u2014the high wail of trumpets, the smooth pull of violins\u2014that frequently comes from behind the church, where Mr. C\u00e9sar teaches outside. He is one of the many in Haiti who learned his rst bars of music at the church's music school. \"My whole identity is here,\" he said, and on this campus at least, reconstruction means more than architecture: a full ar-tistic life is also being rebuilt. The effort to save the murals is a vis- ible extension of a little-known cross-border bond. The Episcopal Church of Haiti was founded by an African-American named James Theodore Holly, who led about 2,000 black Americans to Haiti in 1861 as part of a wider emigra-tion movement. He and his sons played prominent roles as professionals and scholars after founding \"what was actu-ally Haiti's rst national church, and the first Episcopal Church founded outside of the Anglophone world,\" said Laurent Dubois, a historian at Duke University. The eight muralists, while Haitian from their toes to the tips of their paintbrush-es, also had American ties. Many trained at an academy founded by an American artist, DeWitt Peters, who came to Haiti in 1943. Credit for the work, though, must also be shared by the Haitian bishops and priests who \"gave them the liberty they needed,\" said Mr. C\u00e9sar. Some of the un-conventional images would later become controversial for Christians who saw links to Vodou, but for many Haitians and art historians, they represented one of this country's proudest cultural moments. The earthquake ruined much of that. Only the Last Supper, Native Procession and the Baptism of Christ survived\u2014and each work bears the wounds of the vi-cious tremor that killed 300,000 people. The paintings' winding cracks, running through legs, through torsos, and through the neck of a dark-skinned woman in the baptism scene who seems to be scream-ing, are violent and painful. Ms. Hornbeck said that conservators and the church are still discussing which damaged elements must be xed. But Mr. C\u00e9sar, standing near the church's former entrance, said he had little doubt about whether the paintings would be fully restored, or left how they appeared after the quake. He said that in-stead of rebuilding the church, religious leaders are planning to create a garden for the murals, in which they can reside in nature, earthquake scars and all. He said it was the only way to remember, the only way to move on. \"We have to live with it,\" he said, staring at the roofl ess sanctuary and piles of rubble. \"We have to learn how to live with it.\" Reprinted from the New York Times, February 22, 2011 The mural Baptism painted by Castera Bazile in 1951 survived the earthquake.

The training of technicians for such an endeavor is tricky under normal circumstances; at the Holy Trinity Cathedral it was made doubly dif cult by the language barrier and the urgency of the project itself. The murals had to come down quickly. Our assistants\u2014Junior Nor\u00e9lus, Junior Racine, Frankie Fontain, and Michel Wanglish\u2014had to learn on the job and be able to work without direct supervision for at least half the time of the project. It was an unorthodox approach to training, to say the least. Nonetheless, it was our only hope for safely removing the murals. The challenges became apparent on the rst day of training. We began by explaining that the goal of the work was to remove the fragments and store them for future reinstallation. Immediately we noticed a drop in enthusiasm. We were not sure what this was about until one of the Juniors asked, \"Will we be repainting the murals?\" As artists, their idea of restoration was recreation of what was missing. Thus we began the process by clarifying the difference between salvage of something damaged, and its total reproduction. We then moved to surface cleaning and documentation. Our goal was to get them up to speed on a particular task, so they would be prepared to work on something simple and straightforward in our absence. Instructions were written in English, and translated by Junior Nor\u00e9lus into Krey\u00f2l. To maximize the work in the short period of conservators' time on site, we took turns going back and forth to Haiti. As the wall paintings conservator, Viviana served as the primary site supervisor. Rosa would fl y in to assist with troubleshooting technical problems and supervising issues related to mortar stabilization. As the project expanded from twelve to twenty weeks, the assistants were assigned particular jobs in accordance with their skills. On a given day one would be tasked with gluing the wooden supports while another prepared the repair mortar mix. Junior Nor\u00e9lus was assigned the post of Chief Technician and provided supervision while we were not on site. Still, because we had so much information to impart and we were operating with the language barrier, initially both we and our assistants were overwhelmed. When we would return to the site we would nd that occasional liberties had been taken. We tried numerous tactics for getting our points across, arriving nally at two key successful methods. The rst was to have the assistants repeat our instructions to each other in Krey\u00f2l before committing them to paper. The second was to lm them as they worked. These processes imparted a sense of ownership for the project to them, rather than having them simply be the recipients of instructions. With a little bit of Krey\u00f2l here, some Spanish or English there, we developed a common language between us. Con dence grew and we all sang Wyclef Jean songs as we worked. We began calling them \"the murals dream team,\" and in turn they nicknamed Viviana \"Teminato,\" which is Krey\u00f2l for \"little terminator,\" and called Rosa \"Abit,\" which means referee. Our dream team's con dence grew. They made recommendations to us for improving the protection and removal of the fragments and helped design new tools for removing dif cult areas. At the project's June press conference, the two Juniors, Frankie and Michel, impressed the Haitian media with their poise and understanding of the processes. At Holy Trinity necessity was the mother of invention. In this case, a major result, in addition to the preservation of the murals, was the development of four ne conservation technicians who are well-versed in many of the basic processes of mural salvage and conservation. 164 SAVING THE MURALS AT HOLY TRINITY CATHEDRAL NOT FOR SALE OR REPRODUCTIONThe murals \"dream team\" with Snyder Clerge, Frankie Fontain, Jean Derazin, Viviana Dominguez, Rosa Lowinger, Junior Racine, Michel Wanglish, and Junior Nor\u00e9lus.

Hugues Berthin, who received the intensive four-day training, learned various conservation and restoration techniques to apply to depending on the type of damage. He is now on site at the Nader Gallery and will be in charge of the restoration of the 3,000 damaged paintings that were recovered from the Museum. While the process will be very long, the Smithsonian has given us the tools to get it up and running. \u2014Georges Nader, Jr. [Right] Trainees Jean the ICCROM course engaged in a group exercise.

Photo by Aparna TandonFrom the very rst discussion of the activities that eventually led to the Haiti Cultural Recovery Project, training was conceived as a central, integral component. My colleague Johnnetta Cole, a life-long educator, had made this abundantly clear. Given what we, in the United States familiar with Haiti knew of the situation, particularly with regard to collection management and conservation, we realized that Haiti needed help with professional skills, facilities, and materials for this type of w ork. Internationally, Mounir Bouchenaki, the Director-General of ICCROM, with his long experience at UNESCO, also knew that training was both needed and vital. No matter what the American or international intervention, the care and stewardship of Haiti's collections would be in Haitian hands. The more adept those hands were, the better cared for the collections would be. 166 TRAINING NOT FOR SALE OR REPRODUCTIONPatrick Delatour insisted on training as a central component of the recovery project as a matter of principal\u2014he had received professional training that prepared him and an excellent team to work on the restoration of the Citadel decades before. Haiti would benefit from the transfer of knowledge and skills in order to build up the prowess of its own students and professionals. Beyond that, the Haitian government believed it important that the recovery efforts\u2014in whatever sector, reinforce local and national capacity building in their country. Culture was no different. Our effort had to improve the knowledge and skill base and the expertise of Haitians and their institutions. Olsen Jean Julien turned this orientation into action. He wisely conceived of the Center's training program as upgrading and developing the skills of people already working with collections and institutions, public and private. They might have not received any prior training in, say, conservation, but, if they worked in the museum or library or gallery, they could improve their knowledge and upgrade their skills. And as long as they continued to work at that organization, they would serve it better than before. Olsen's was a thoughtful alternative to recruiting young college students for training\u2014because as able and willing as they might be, they were not as yet connected to Haiti's cultural organizations. In charting the work plan of the Cultural Recovery Center, we knew we could treat thousands of items and restore a small number, but that the key lasting contribution would be training. This would give Haitians the means to engage in what would surely be a generation-long activity to recover from the earthquake. Ultimately, it would be Haitians who would preserve Haitian cultural heritage. The Smithsonian sought out ICCROM to help us with training and organizing a large course because they know their business well\u2014and they could amass materials written in French, and trainers fluent in the language who could readily communicate with Haitian trainees. In addition to a formal course, the Center sponsored a series of workshops and training sessions\u2014conserving paintings, conserving metal works, conserving photographs, books and works on paper, inventorying and collection management. Training was also included in the everyday work routines of staff, technicians, assistants, and the visiting conservators. Training was part of the everyday, on-the-job work in preparing and taking down the murals. Training was infused into the work of the team treating the Centre d'Art collection. Every visiting conservator and expert was drawn into training\u2014give a talk, do a demonstration, gather people around to observe a treatment. Even I was asked to give a lecture and discuss project development, management, and fund raising. It was not only the Haitians learning. We all did. Conservators learned by doing and interacting with people and collections unfamiliar to them. Insights from Haitian colleagues gave clues and perspectives useful for doing restorations and treatments. Having Pr\u00e9f\u00e8te Duffaut, one of the Holy Trinity mural artists on hand to talk about the painting of the murals\u2014the paints, the substrate\u2014with the conservators charged with taking them down was particularly helpful and special. Similarly, discussions with Haitian artists and assistants about what, how much, and how to restore a painting, were rich and important. Finally, we had several younger conservators from the U.S. and Canada participating in the project. They too learned about techniques, working in the field, and listening closely and carefully to their colleagues to understand the history and contexts of works to be treated. As the project reached its sixteen-month mark, more than one hundred participants, representing some eighty different people from more than two dozen cul-tural organizations, had been involved in one or another formal training session. This broad participation has had the effect of diffusing knowledge of conservation and collection management widely in Haiti. We wanted to have Haitians help save their own cultural heritage, obviously, and because there's not as much infrastructure for that in Haiti, we knew that training would be a big component of the project. \u2014Corine Wegener 167 TRAINING NOT FOR SALE OR REPRODUCTIONBuilding capacity via training is perhaps the most important and lasting legacy of the Haiti Cultural Recovery Project. The absence of a strong infrastructure devoted to the conservation of cultural heritage collections in Haiti necessitated building one from the ground-up during the response effort. Yet, providing introductory training while simultaneously responding to a disaster of large proportion is not an ideal sequence of events. Indeed, we seemed to be working back-ward from an advanced problem; we had to craft a conservation training model based on the practical needs demanded by the disaster. Our training objective was not to create conservators, as that process requires years of formal study; our goal was to in- troduce concepts, ethics, and practical techniques to enable us to rapidly stabilize the highest volume possible of damaged art works, artifacts, and works on paper. Foreign expertise has been provided by the Smithsonian Institution, the American Institute for Conservation of Historic and Artistic Works (AIC), and the International Center for the Study of Restoration and Preservation (ICCROM). Cultural Recovery Center colleagues Olsen Jean Julien, Fritz Berg Jeannot, and Carmelita Douby identi ed potential Haitian col-leagues at cultural institutions and at universities. Based on our conservation needs, I contributed topic proposals, course content development, and selection of appropriate instructors. Fritz Berg drew on his decade of experience as an educator to provide administrative support throughout the duration of the project. He assisted every instructor with the successful development and realization of training objectives and wrote formal reports on our training activities. Training has been offered via various models, including courses, workshops, and on-the-job practical experience; all initiatives have been offered without cost to the participants. Indeed, the Cultural Recovery Center has offered stipends and salaries to trainees. Most Haitian culture professionals have had limited exposure to contemporary preservation concepts. So, it has been important to introduce conservation concepts like assessment, intervention, stabilization, repair, restoration, and the importance of documentation and ethical practices. A key educational outreach objective involved aligning foreign experts with local colleagues to reinforce theoretical concepts with practical work, often on-site at affected collections. We began with a broad, rst aid response to global collections care. This rst large training initiative was custom-built by a team from ICCROM, who visited Port-au-Prince and selected affected sites in early June 2010. ICCROM Project Coordinator Aparna Tandon oversaw the curriculum and selected French-speaking instructors Vesna Zivkovic from Serbia and Elisabeth Joy from Canada, to join her. Twenty-six professionals from fourteen public and private institutions in Port-au-Prince participated in three weeks of study. Topics included preventive care, storage, documentation, stabilization, and health and safety. Subsequent training sessions were developed and timed to prepare for work on speci c projects. These sessions were of- fered to artists and chemists, selected via postings at local universities. The earliest works to arrive at the Cultural Recove ry Center were badly damaged paintings from private collections. So, \"Introduction to Painting Conservation\"was offered rst and taught by Viviana Dominguez. Paul Jett of the Smithsonian's Freer and Sackler Galleries, AIC's Jane Norman and I taught \"Introduction to Metal Object Conservation.\" Smithsonian conservators Rosemary Fallon of the National Portrait Gallery, and Emily Jacobson of the Freer and Sackler Galleries, taught \"Introduction to Paper Conservation\" in order to prepare teams to process damaged sculpture and works on paper in the Centre d'Art collection. \"Preservation of Audio-Visual Materials,\" taught by Sarah Stauderman of the Smithsonian Institution Archives, targeted participants who work primarily for broadcast communication outlets throughout Port-au-Prince. Over 100 colleagues have participated in training initiatives. Several longer projects\u2014stabilization of the Centre d'Art collection, the Holy Trinity Episcopal Cathedral murals project, and the storage upgrade for the Lehmann Collection of Vodou Art\u2014allowed for on-the-job reinforcement of theory learned in workshops. A corps of twelve studio assistants bene ted from more involved study and aided in multiple projects. A primary objective involved developing capacity in multiple areas, which include data entry for inventories, photographic and written documentation, and surface-cleaning. Our assistants have aided both local professionals and foreign experts to stabilize collections. With further formal study, they may yet represent the future face of preservation efforts in Haiti. TRAINING AS LEGACY STEPHANIE HORNBECK 168 TRAINING NOT FOR SALE OR REPRODUCTIONTRAINING AT THE CENTER J. M. FRITZ BERG JEANNOT From the beginning of the Haiti Cultural Recovery Project, my job has been to organize conservation training. I have had to de ne the content of training programs, establish requirements, identify participants, form groups, organize training sessions, and attend to the follow-up. In short, I perform all the tasks related to training. Over the past year, I coordinated the implementation of nine sessions, including several workshops and a three- week collection management course with ICCROM. While I am a professional engaged in artistic and cultural education, this experience has allowed me to wander a bit into lesser known territory. I am more familiar with stimu-lating artistic creativity than in conveying the concepts and skills of cultural rescue and conservation. For the Center's training sessions, I am attentive to the concepts, methods, and techniques to be learned and the teaching strategies for accomplishing that goal. I have met instructors of different national origins, and have found them to be fully competent and enthusiastic about their work. I have found the Haitian participants eager to learn, to fill gaps, to shake up and consolidate their understandings. I too have learned a lot, interacting with the institutions which care for the treasures of our nation. I've developed a better understanding of what Haiti needs by way of col- lections management training. I expect this experience will serve me well in my future actions to care for Haiti's cul- tural heritage. J. M. Fritz Berg Jeannot is the Training Coordinator for the Haiti Cultural Recovery Center.

Aide d'urgence pour le patrimoine culturel Ha\u00eftien: Former pour conserver, as she explained the signi cance of a partially damaged Vodou fl ag that she had painstakingly salvaged from the wreckage of a fallen building. Her words were deeply moving and set the tone for the rest of day one of the three-week course organized by ICCROM (the International Centre for the Study of the Preservation and Restoration of Cultural Property), and the Smithsonian Institution in cooperation with Haiti's Ministry of Culture and Communication and UNESCO. It was led by a volunteer team from ICCROM, the Canadian Conservation Institute, and Serbia's Central Institute for Conservation. It included twenty-six Haitians of diverse educational backgrounds drawn from fourteen different public and private cultural insti- tutions. In most cases, their institution's buildings and collections had been damaged by the earthquake. In many cases, collection records were lost or simply did not exist. Discussions on day one reinforced the reasons for saving cultural heritage, identifying the priorities of such work, and assessing the status of their collections in terms of location, types of material and estimated number of objects damaged. The training was organized in order to aid Haiti's cultural recovery by building a strong team of Haitian professionals who could take appropriate actions to mitigate post-disaster risks and ensure maximum protection of their respective collections. Initial sessions of the course focused on the material composition of Haitian collections and the identi cation of vari- ous risks they were exposed to; their documentation especially, in the absence of previous records; handling of damaged objects; rst-aid treatments using locally available materials and so on. After an intense week of lectures and hands-on training, course participants were charged with the task of creating temporary but safe storage for the collection of Centre d'Art, which at the time still remained in the two shipping con-tainers. Trainees realized that the containers were not properly sealed, allowing moisture to seep in and the paintings to be infected with mold. The participants and the course team worked together to plan and implement a workfl ow that involved removing the paintings that had been crammed in the containers, documenting, disinfecting, surface-cleaning, labeling, and placing them systematically in a temporary storage area at the Cultural Recovery Center. Eight of the course participants later joined the project team that completed the task of transferring Centre d'Art collection from the containers to the tem- porary storage within three months after the course. At the time of the training, four of the fourteen participating institutions had parts of their collections buried under the rubble of fl attened buildings. The nal week of the course thus included a salvage exercise that was carried out with the technical assistance of MINUSTAH troops. Twenty U.N. peacekeepers drawn from the Japanese Force Engineering Military Section, the course team and participants gathered at the site of Centre d' Art to salvage art works and archives still buried under the wreckage of the building. The participants were organized in an emergency team and were given speci c tasks ranging from documentation to rst aid treatments. While the Japanese army personnel cleared the heavy rubble with heavy machinery, the participants and the course team worked to recover the artifacts that had been trapped under the debris for more than six months. Over 150 artifacts and documents were salvaged as a result of this exercise. \"The training has given me hope,\" said Marise Desrosiers, a participant and staff member of Centre d'Art, as she described her experience. In the nal days of training, participants worked together to develop action plans for safeguarding the collections of their respective institutions. Subsequently, they have improved the storage for their collections, undertaken special conservation projects, and have met several times at the Cultural Recovery Center to share their progress. Their spirit is best described in the words of one of the participants, Colette Armenta: \"From now-on we cannot live alone\u2014the course has given me a fresh perspective on the value of teamwork.\" Aparna Tandon has been a Project Specialist at ICCROM since 2004. She has advanced training in the conservation of art, paper and audio-visual materials with residencies at the Harvard University Art Museums, the Library of Congress and the Getty Conservation Institute. 170 TRAINING NOT FOR SALE OR REPRODUCTIONICCROM's Aparna Tandon (center front) leads the three-week training workshop that included site visits to museums such as to MUPANAH.

Their men were operating the backhoe to help unearth and save artworks that might still be found in the rubble of the half-destroyed Centre d'Art. Peace keep-ers from Nepal were guarding the site; American and local TV crews were interviewing; Haitian workshop participants along with conservators born in the U.S., India, Canada, and Serbia were digging in a collaborative on-site effort. We were a mixed and international group of hopeful helpers each equipped with dedication, hard hats, and gloves. Our goal was to rescue any remaining artworks which included sculp-tured limbs mostly buried, damaged and still intact as well as broken frames and soggy shreds of painted canvas. Unfortunately, exposure to the elements over the months was apparent with weeds and grass growing amongst the debris of crumbling bricks, wet earth, rusty nails, rotting wood, and art. As a paintings conservator, I had volunteered for two weeks to be put to use where best needed. Upon my arrival, the conservation training workshop offered by ICCROM was already in progress but a member of their team had had to cancel at the last minute. I was asked to step in, especially since I spoke French. With the amazing determination and expertise of instructors from ICCROM, CCI, and the Smithsonian, I was able to partake in an unforget-table experience. In that short time, I had to build a close, educational relationship with the workshop participants. My job was to communicate the basic steps of the handling and rudimentary cleaning of paintings on canvas and masonite and to help organize their removal from the temporary storage containers. This project provided a stimulating exchange of information. Sometimes group dynamics and our cultural differences sparked but we seemed to always be able to reunite with our shared goal of rescuing the artworks. Often, it was necessary to put aside egos, surmount fatigue and frustration to consider the personal loss of others with our recovery mission in mind\u2014save and conserve the art! This approach was reinforced when one participant physically shoved me aside while I at- tempted to direct her newly learned conservation efforts. Her other team members berated her action but she sat there in muted de ance. At that point, I decided irrespective of whether she was going to accept my direction or not, whether my feelings were hurt or not, somehow I had to impart the importance of her new role as guardian of the art. It was essential to calmly convey that I was not a foreigner imposing my ideas on another culture. Rather, I was trying to be a sensitive and sympathetic conservation teacher to a reluctant and perhaps overwhelmed student. Undaunted and trying a different approach I patiently persisted and by the next week, at the end of the seminar, my efforts were rewarded with a big hug and thank you from this new student of conservation. Recovery was ongoing on many levels and saving the artworks seemed to be connected to saving hope for the future as well as remembering the past.

Photo by Stephanie Hornbeck 172 TRAINING NOT FOR SALE OR REPRODUCTIONWORKSHOP ON THE PRESERVATION AND CONSERVATION OF WORKS OF ART ON PAPER AND PHOTOGRAPHS ROSEMARY FALLON There was a nagging uncertainty in the back of my mind about the unsettled political situa- tion and the prevalence of disease but I still felt compelled to volunteer for the Haiti project. Stephanie Hornbeck asked Freer/Sackler colleague, Emily Jacobson, and me to teach a three- day workshop on paper and photographs conservation to Haitians at the Center. The range of topics included in the workshop was the deterioration and care of art on paper and photo-graphic collections, disaster preparedness and recovery, and preventive conservation in a tropi-cal climate. Basic paper conservation procedures were taught in practical sessions to prepare the Haitian students with skills to stabilize collections when processing damaged works on paper and photographs. We touched down on the tarmac at Port-au-Prince with all of our supplies in tow in our lug- gage and a bit anxious, hoping our workshop would not be cancelled due to political unrest. The trip from the airport to the Cultural Recovery Center was an abrupt orientation to the conditions in Port-au-Prince. The streets were teeming with families struggling to survive. Flexibility and improvisation were essential due to limited equipment and supplies one might usually have at hand, and the unpredictability of the schedule. That rst week we assessed the condition of damaged and moldy works of art on paper salvaged from the Center d'Art that were stored in quarantine at the Center. Mold remediation and surface cleaning was com-pleted on several of these artworks. Some of these pieces were used in the practical sessions of the workshop. These sessions were geared towards stabilization of artworks using basic paper conservation techniques of surface cleaning, mending tears, and proper storage. Occasionally we stumped our Haitian translator when using speci c conservation terminology. There were some dozen students from varied backgrounds in our workshop. Some were artists, chemists, a gallery owner, and employees from the National Library. They enjoyed the practi-cal sessions and wished they had more time for hands-on work. More time would have been bene cial because it was dif cult to cover such a range of topics in three days. The hope is that we had as much impact on the students as they had on us. Rosemary Fallon is a Paper Conservator at the Smithsonian's National Portrait Gallery. 173 TRAINING NOT FOR SALE OR REPRODUCTIONSHARING EXPERTISE EMILY KLAYMAN JACOBSON I traveled to Haiti from January 31 through February 10, 2011 with fellow Smithsonian paper conservator Rosemary Fallon to co-teach a workshop on basic preservation of art on paper and photographs. Before we left for Haiti the scope of the course kept growing\u2014we were asked to include information on disaster planning, mold removal, and basic paper repair techniques\u2014each a subject that could take a week alone. The course included topics such as: preventive conservation in a tropical climate; identi cation of print and photographic processes; proper handling of prints and photos; condition problems and conservation treatments; and demonstrations of various treatment techniques. This was followed by hands-on practice in the treatment techniques by the participants. It is extremely dif cult to get good quality supplies in Haiti so we ordered materials that we would need to bring with us. Since shipping to Haiti was dif cult we had to hand-carry ev- erything with us. I brought an entire duffl e bag with supplies, including materials such as soft dusting brushes and acid-free folders and tissues for storage. Additionally, we brought folders for each participant that included handouts on preservation in both English and French. We had twelve students in the workshop who were a mix of people from private galleries, public institutions, such as the National Library of Haiti, and artists and scientists who were being trained to become conservation technicians. Teaching the workshop was the best part of the trip. The participants were extremely interested and attentive students. They asked a myriad of questions and were like sponges for information. Since neither Rosemary nor I spoke French we had a translator which caused a bit of a problem since many conservation terms and English idioms can be dif cult to translate. At one point we discovered that our description of wheat starch paste (a commonly used conservation adhesive) being the consistency of skim milk was translated into adding skim milk to the paste! Normally after a natural disaster the one way that I can contribute is to donate money. The establishment of the Center allowed me to contribute in a much more ful lling way by shar- ing my expertise directly with the Haitian people to help them preserve their cultural heritage. Emily Klayman Jacobson is a Paper & Photographs Conservator in the Department of Conservation and Scienti c Research at the Smithsonian's Freer & Sackler Galleries. I have now been to Haiti and worked with members of the Cultural Recovery Center three times. Each time I go back I nd more to do and more to learn. \u2014Vicki Lee 174 TRINING NOT FOR SALE OR REPRODUCTIONTEACHING COLLECTION MANAGEMENT SHARLA BLANCHE I spent a few days in June 2011 teaching \"Collections Management Workshop: Documentation and Registration\" to more than a dozen Haitian professionals at the Cultural Recovery Center. Because I do not speak French or Krey\u00f2l I had to rely on the assistance and translation skills of \u00c9lo\u00efse Paquette, the Conservator from the Centre of Conservation in Quebec. I sought to give students an overall sense of what is en- tailed in such positions as registrar and collections manag-er. Typically, advanced- level coursework related to the ba-sics of collection registration and collections management occurs over a semester\u2014and we simply did not have the time for that. So we collectively decided what information would be most bene cial to learn within the brief three day period allotted for the workshop. Through a lively ex- change of ideas and questions by the students, they settled on their own goals for the workshop which meant paring down of my course outline. Their participation made the workshop an enjoyable and engaging experience. The Cultural Recovery Center has a number of collection objects that I borrowed from the labs. \u00c9lo\u00efse and I taught the workshop attendees how to handle objects appropri-ately, how to accurately measure artwork, write condition reports using standard museum terms, label objects, use photographic documentation, and understand the neces-sity of using a catalogue system. Having the students participate in a \"hands-on\" manner gave them a sense of professional practice and allowed them to actively acquire knowledge rather than be mere observers. For example, writing condition reports to record the overall details and current state of an object can often be seen as tedious. Yet these professionals engaged in serious debates, challenging one another to really look at objects and note the current condition, daring one another not to overlook the minutest of details. The outcome of the program was wonderful. The Haitian attendees gained a more thorough understanding of col-lections management practices while I gained a deeper knowledge of their culture and art.

I was a bit reluctant to answer the call for help. But, upon further refl ection, and wanting to help Haiti in any way possible, I asked myself what I could offer and how I could really help them? The answer just came straight up in my mind: by being a paintings conservator. Is there any bet- ter way to help people than with the thing you are good at and the thing you love to do? I submitted my name and deployed to Haiti in January 2011 with my employer, the Minist\u00e8re de la Culture, des Communications et de la Condition F\u00e9minine of Qu\u00e9bec giving me the time to do so. I arrived in a country still in rubble, but found the people of Haiti full of joy and eager to reconstruct something bet- ter. My rst language being French, I could communicate well with the Haitians working at the Cultural Recovery Center, and I'm pleased to say some of them became my friends. Because of my language skills, I did the translation work for two workshops given by Smithsonian conserva-tors, and carried out some conservation treatments as well. My rst stay was not even nished when I decided to come back, which I did months later. This time I took vacation time to go to Haiti and was happy to do so in order to help people who really needed it. In Haiti I learned that when you have nothing left, art and culture are the things you hold on to. It is what the Haitian people hold dearly on right now while they try to rebuild a better country for themselves. I am proud to have helped. \u00c9lo\u00efse Paquette is a Paintings Conservator at the Centre de conservation du Qu\u00e9bec, in Qu\u00e9bec City, Canada, part of the Minist\u00e8re de la Culture, des Communications et de la Condition F\u00e9minine of Qu\u00e9bec.

Having conducted all of my pre-program conservation work in eld laboratories that were chronically short of both money and resources, I felt that I had a handle on the upcoming challenges and dif cul- ties that working in Haiti might present. Still, I was apprehensive\u2014but I was going and I was ready to learn. During my four week stay in Port-au-Prince, I was able to work on a number of different objects, allowing me to truly expand my skill set. I treated a series of fer d\u00e9coup\u00e9 sculptures rescued from the collapsed Centre d'Art, papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9 architectural moldings from a school in Jacmel, and a number of pieces being held for ISPAN (L'Institut de Sauvegarde du Patrimoine National) including the Acte d'Ind\u00e9pendence and a series of busts of the four Haitian \"found-ing fathers\" made of varying materials including painted bronze and plaster. During my nal week in Haiti I worked on site at the Lehmann Gallery, helping to clean, assess, and catalogue the vast collection of Vodou objects that made up the collection. The Haitian conservation assistants that I had the opportunity to work with were an absolute pleasure. In particular, I worked with two assistants, Junior Nor\u00e9lus and Marc Gerard Estim\u00e9, both of whom were artists\u2014a sculptor and a painter. I worked with both Nor\u00e9lus and Estim\u00e9 on the ISPAN objects. Though both men came from similar backgrounds, their working styles and approaches to conservation differed signi cantly. Both learned extremely fast, but while Nor\u00e9lus was interested in the most ef cient and pragmatic approaches to conservation treat-ment, Estim\u00e9 wanted to better understand the decision making process, not only to grasp our reasons and justi cations for materials and methods, but so that he could better develop the ability to make those decisions himself in the future. Their insightful questions forced me to better understand my own reasons and methods. Their hunger for knowledge and their desire to learn reminded me of why I had become a conservation student in the rst place, because, let's face it, there are not too many of us who enjoy a lively conversation about adhesives! Outside of my experience as a conservator, I also learned while working in Haiti that many of our perceptions are wrong. What we see in the media is loss, destruction, and an utterly daunting lack of progress. But there is progress\u2014everywhere you look, people are working every single day to take back their city and their homes. It isn't about destruction and loss-it's about living and rebuilding. I've learned that the Haitian people deserve our respect. I've seen them work harder than anyone I've ever seen, without a complaint; I've seen them smile in the face of their own tragedy, and I've seen in them a pride of country and culture that is truly inspiring.

Instead, my four weeks were lled with learning about new materials and the responsibilities of an advisor. As my deployment was a full month, I was assigned to work on an involved treatment project; an acrylic on masonite painting by Stivenson Magloire with numerous breaks. Executing a full-scale treatment was unusual at the Center, and this was to serve as a great material for training the conservation staff. Being a student specializing in photograph conservation, both of these responsibilities were new experiences.On day two, I was introduced to Erntz Jeudy, a Haitian assistant working at the Center. Erntz worked with me on the painting. He was a recent graduate of the University of Haiti and a true multi-media artist, working in clothing design, and as a painter, sculptor, and musician. Erntz had minimum experience in conservation, but he had wonderful hand skills, was a criti- cal thinker, and was strongly motivated to learn. I explained the rationale of each step of the treatment to help him understand what we were doing, and although this slowed down the treatment, I realized that it was time well spent as our discussions could achieve more than my initial goals. Giving explanations and answering questions forced me to review my thinking and to evaluate the procedures. Erntz was full of ideas, and together we often discovered improvements to our approaches. The practice of guiding someone was one of the most rewarding and important aspects in my involvement with the project.

Photo by Stephanie Hornbeck TRAINING 178 NOT FOR SALE OR REPRODUCTION179 TRAINING NOT FOR SALE OR REPRODUCTIONThe treatment of art works, artifacts, historical documents, rare books, architectural features, and other cultural materials has been at the heart of the Haiti Cultural Recovery Project. The objec- tive has been to safeguard objects\u2014clean, stabilize, and securely store them. In some cases this has meant the relatively simple act of vacuuming off the detritus of the earthquake. It other cases, such as the murals, it has necessitated months of complex activi- ties. In some hundred cases conservators have gone further and actually completed time consuming restorations.CHAPTER ELEVEN CONSERVATION: PROGRESS AND CHALLENGES Our conservators have achieved some remarkable and dramatic results. Such stable treatments preserve cultural patrimony for future generations and prove that advanced conservation work is certainly possible in Haiti. \u2014Stephanie Hornbeck What I have learned is that conservators work very carefully and deliberately. They are like doctors treating patients\u2014understanding the needs of each and every item before them, rendering a proper diagnosis, and implementing a solution to their illness. Even more than most physicians these days, conservators spend a lot of time with the items they treat\u2014really getting to know them and the particularity of their ailments. And conservators deliberate over, discuss, and explore a variety of options and alternatives in developing a treatment plan. Of the dozens of Smithsonian and AIC-af liated conservators deployed through the project, each and everyone had his or her own dialogue with particular objects of Haiti's material culture. These dialogues were clearly exercises in cultural learning; set in a con- text of post-earthquake trauma, in a nation ar tistically and historically rich, yet bereft of so many resources and comforts. The project enjoyed enormous success, treating some 30,000 items and training scores of Haitians to continue treatments into the future. While the projects with the Centre d'Art and the Holy Trinity Episcopal Cathedral were large and newsworthy, the conservation of rare books from the National Library, the Corvington and Trouillot col- lections, and treatment of documents held by the National Archives were just as impor- tant. We had thought that the International Committee of the Blue Shield (ICBS) would establish a parallel recovery center\u2014called \"The Ark\"\u2014for the treatment of books and 180 CONSERVATION: PROGRESS AND CHALLENGES NOT FOR SALE OR REPRODUCTION[Upper] Center Conservation Assistant Eddnyio Jeune and Objects Conservator Ana\u00efs Gailhbaud from France examine an iron sculpture.

The Smithsonian and the ICBS had even signed a memorandum of understanding providing for a division of labor in cultural recovery efforts. Y et, when their plans fell through, the need to preserve valuable historical materials did not disappear. The Smithsonian and its partners stepped in. While the Haiti Cultural Recovery Project has helped preserve a good deal of Haiti's material culture, much more remains to be done. There were also some areas where solutions to conservation problems eluded us, and even where we agonized over outright failures. T elevision and radio stations, professional and amateur documentarians in Haiti have amassed a great deal of audio-visual material\u2014photographs, lm, videotape and sound recordings\u2014that provides a record of ceremonies and performances, concerts and readings, speeches and songs of the Haitian people. It is a record of Haiti's living cul-ture\u2014what UNESCO calls \"intangible cultural heritage.\" Some of those documentary recordings were made in theaters and refl ect formal, schooled performances; others were made in the countryside, in Vodou honfor s or temples, and refl ect the grassroots, authentic folklife of Haitian communities. A large number of organizations and individuals have such materials. Though we examined and assessed many of these collections, and con-ducted workshops in the preservation of photographs and in the basic care for sound recordings, we were unable to develop a truly effective means of working with all these collections. This remains important work to be done in the future. 181 CONSERVATION: PROGRESS AND CHALLENGES NOT FOR SALE OR REPRODUCTIONSo too, much work needs to be done on Haiti's living cultural traditions. Various attempts to document, and support work on intangible cultural heritage in Haiti came to naught. Laval University in Qu\u00e9bec, which has an ongoing educational program with the State University of Haiti, proposed survey and researcher train-ing projects, but failed to muster both the funds and the institutional arrangements to bring its proposal to fruition. The Haiti Cultural Recovery Project developed a proposal on intangible cultural heritage with the Haitian Ministry of Culture and Communication for submission to UNESCO. The project would examine the impact of the earthquake on the cultural practices and the material conditions of community temples in the capital region and explore the ways that local people could preserve the traditions closest to them. Perhaps caught between the UNESCO and Haitian bureaucracies, that proposal received no support. Notably, with regard to material culture collections, the project was unable to develop viable collaborations with two important organizations. One eluded engage-ment, the other moved too slowly, until it was too late. This respectively imperils the collections of the National Bureau of Ethnology and resulted in the loss of the stained glass at the National Cathedral. The building housing the ethnological collections is on the same street as the Centre d'Art, and like it, collapsed in the earthquake. Thousands of artifacts, docu-menting Haiti's history, spilled off shelves and into the debris and rubble. Many were housed in plastic Tupperware containers, and when I rst went by the building, the massive potpourri of blue plastic container covers offered a sad and striking visual incongruity. The Haiti Cultural Recovery Project allocated funds to the recovery of this collection. Much could be done by merely picking artifacts up off the ground. We were ready to bring in heavy equipment and depending upon engineering assess-ments, either demolish or shore up the damaged building so as to allow for the retrieval of thousands of artifacts. We tried over and over again to obtain permission to work on the site, yet could not. Over the course of some sixteen months, we've seen two seasons of rain and storms come and go, and nothing being done to save this unique record of Haiti's cultural history. Inaction by the leadership of this public organization remains inexplicable. An even more dramatic failure has been evident with the stained glass of the National Cathedral. We'd been amazed from our very first visit that the beauti-ful glass\u2014arranged in decorative rosettes as well as in gurative saintly representa- tions\u2014did not break or shatter in the earthquake as the whole massive church caved in and was reduced to rubble. We sought from the outset of the project a means of retrieving the stained glass. Like the murals at the Holy Trinity Cathedral, we real-ized this would be a long and somewhat complex process involving the clearing of steel and concrete and the use of lifts and scaffolding in order to remove glass from their lead encasements, some set in damaged walls forty or fty-feet high. It took months and months to get permission from the Cathedral's of cials to do the work. We contracted with a Haitian American stained glass expert, Kesler Pierre, to do an assessment and develop a plan. When nally we received permission to proceed, we sent guards to help secure the site. What they found was that almost all the glass was gone. Some turned up on eBay , but most lay shattered on the site, discarded as value- less to looters out to salvage the lead that had held it in place. I did not share with Kesler his depth of knowledge or emotional history with the stained glass. But I had been in the Cathedral amidst the dismaying rubble on one superbly beautiful day. I'd seen the glass aglow, peacefully and brilliantly channeling light onto the hulking, lifeless remains. It did so in such a hopeful, literally uplifting way\u2014so that one could easily imagine light itself cleansing the bent steel rafters and massive concrete boulders from the Cathedral fl oor. The artistry of the stained glass was evident, producing the visual cue for transcendence. Now, it was gone\u2014and so too, as Kesler notes, something sacred was now lost forever.

By its nature, disaster response work involves aspects that swing from tragic to uplifting. We worked alongside Haitian colleagues, who had suffered trau-matic personal loss and signi cant damage to national cultural patrimony. Together, we tried to repair what fractures we could. On several fronts, the Haiti Cultural Recovery Project faced signi cant challenges. The applica- tion of a broad-based conservation approach was needed to confront a spectrum of pressing issues: rst aid intervention, stabilization, overall collection care, and treatment. Progress on the project's priorities also involved navigating a multi-cultural environment. As the American professional working on the ground in Port-au-Prince for the longest period on the project, I wondered how to communicate in a culture that seemed insular to me. Knowledge of a back- ground context of decades of American involvement, with periods of unwelcome interference, in Haiti lodged in my thoughts. To transmit conservation knowledge effectively, communication and receptivity were both necessary. To introduce conservation here, Haitian colleagues had to value what we offered. Yet, inserting specialized foreign expertise into a local infrastructure that lacked the needed expertise required delicacy. I believed that understanding the impact of our collaboration on our Haitian colleagues was important to achievement of our work goals. We opened several training sessions by asking course participants why cultural recovery of Haitian patrimony was important to them. Many expressed their beliefs in the importance of saving their artistic heritage, which they spoke about in sincere terms refl ecting a sense of national pride. In many conversations, colleagues described their experiences with limited access to information and variable, often random, professional opportunities for exposure to current preservation methods. Many expressed en- thusiasm for our efforts to expose them to current practices by sharing our expertise. CHALLENGES: DISASTER AFTERMATH, FRACTURED INFRASTRUCTURE, INSTITUTIONAL OBSTACLES The over-arching challenge involved response to a cultural catastrophe of devastating propor-tions while simultaneously building a local base of preservation and conservation professionals from the ground-up. The damage sustained by thousands of individual art works, public monuments, and historic structures posed advanced conservation problems. These included: paintings that are torn, punctured, or broken; works on paper that are badly torn and crumpled; sculpture that is bro- ken, deformed, or corroded; and built heritage in total collapse. Haiti has a tropical climate which encourages biological degradation and infestation; two issues, which when encountered [Upper] Yannick Augustin cleans a rare book from the Corvington collection.

Photo by Richard Kurin/Smithsonian 184 CONSERVATION: PROGRESS AND CHALLENGES NOT FOR SALE OR REPRODUCTIONon works of art must be addressed foremost, as they result in continuing degradation, which can spread to other works of art. Site visits to private and public collections revealed that basic collections care and house-keep- ing measures were largely non-existent, even pre-earthquake. A decades-long problem with electricity meant that even collections that have it and can provide air-conditioning or fan-power for air circulation, cannot provide it continuously. Many institutions did not have screens on their windows, allowing for a build-up of dirt and exposure to pollution. Except in rare cases, most institutions do not have basic written or photographic inventories of their collections. Similarly, most collections have not been prioritized to identify the most culturally important art works. The absence of this information signi cantly impaired recovery and treatment efforts be- cause we had to undertake cataloguing documentation simultaneously with our recovery work. At the outset, I encountered misperceptions about conservation, mainly an expectation of full restoration\u2014the addition of non-original materials to achieve aesthetic integration\u2014of art works. While restoration is not a conservation priority when collections have been gravely damaged in a natural disaster, it amounted to the main exposure colleagues had had to repair work. Many antiquated methods are in place and these rely on what materials are available locally, including shoe repair glues, impure waxes, cellophane, and masking tapes. An education component to the project was critical, as many colleagues had limited or non- existent exposure to contemporary preservation concepts, theory, ethics, and practices. A professional conservation perspective involves a global approach comprising preventive care, stewardship of collections, stabilization, and treatment. It was important to explain the need to rst stabilize collections, then to prioritize works by cultural importance prior to treatment, as a signi cant time commitment is involved to treat badly damaged works. It was necessary to correct and update detrimental practices by teaching that inaction, poor storage conditions, and improper treatment methods using unstable materials are damaging to works of art, too. Establishing a multi-national project that depends on Haitian partnerships requires time to build relationships and trust. From June until late August 2010, numerous meetings were held to lay the ground-work for collaboration. During this period works of art were slow to arrive at the Center and critical work time was elapsing. Larger environmental and societal conditions impacted project staf ng and activities, as well. A cholera outbreak in October 2010, Hurricane Tomas in November 2010, political unrest around the presidential election results in December 2010 and February 2011, a strike by public employ-ees in April 2011, and Tropical Storm Emily in August 2011 caused the Center to close its doors temporarily. These were times of particular stress and uncertainty. [Left] Paintings Conservator Krist\u00edn G\u00edslad\u00f3ttir from Iceland examines the restoration treatment given a painting.

Photo by Richard Kurin/SmithsonianOver a period of four months I treated a dozen paintings from the Centre d'Art, Nader Museum, National Palace, and MUPANAH. These paintings represent different twentieth century movements in Haitian art, and the cultural heritage of the country. Working on complex treatments after a disaster is a very rewarding experience. Paintings at the Center would undergo transformations not commonly seen in conservation laboratories\u2014in some cases literally from torn rags to beautiful art. This unique situation was an extraordinary opportunity and demonstrated clearly the importance of our work. \u2014Krist\u00edn G\u00edslad\u00f3ttir, Painting Conservator from Iceland 185 CONSERVATION: PROGRESS AND CHALLENGES NOT FOR SALE OR REPRODUCTIONPROGRESS: PARTNERSHIPS, IMPROVED COLLECTIONS CARE, CONSERVATION TREATMENTS The response to these challenges involved the application of a systematic approach to col- laboration with our partnering institutions, staf ng projects, and out tting facilities. To build a response team, we needed both foreign conservation experts and local culture profession-als. The Center had a bilateral structure with an administrative side to interface with public and private institutions in Haiti and an operational side to execute work activities. The for-mer comprised mainly Haitian colleagues and the latter foreign conservators and eventually Haitian studio/project assistants. To undertake our work we also needed partnering institu-tions in the public and private sector. The careful groundwork laid by Richard Kurin, Corine Wegener, and Olsen Jean Julien realized important breakthroughs when the murals conservation project for Holy Trinity Episcopal Cathedral began in July 2010 and then when the Centre d'Art board agreed to bring its dam-aged collection of nearly 5,000 works of art to the Cultural Recovery Center for processing and stabilization. In addition, the late summer 2010 ICCROM course served an important edu-cational outreach function, as representatives from fourteen public and private institutions participated. The reputation of the Center was being established, paving the way for other in-stitutions to trust in our ability to undertake conservation work on their cherished collections. Over time, the Cultural Recovery Project realized meaningful progress leading to tangible conservation results in stabilization of collections, storage improvements, training, and treatment of individual works. The project provided signi cant conservation assistance to public and private institutions, including the Centre d'Art, National Museum of the Pantheon, the Lehmann Vodou Collection, the Nader Museum, the National Library, and the National Archives. Assistance included site assessments, stabilization measures such as dry cleaning and treat- ment for mold, improved housing, and storage upgrades. Assessments and stabilization measures were performed at the Centre d'Art, the Lehmann Vodou Collection, Holy Trinity Episcopal Cathedral, the National Archives, the National Library, and the Corvington Library. Other institutions like the Museum of Haitian Art, Galerie Flamboyant, and Rainbow Art Gallery would bene t from complex treatments of individual, culturally important works of art. Training sessions have been offered to support project conservation activities. Over 100 Haitian colleagues have participated in at least one of these training sessions. Some 30,000 works of art, books, documents, monuments, and wall paintings have been recovered and sta-bilized. More involved conservation treatments were performed by professional conservators on over 100 badly damaged works deemed of high cultural priority. Providing eighteen months of expertise and exposure to preservation concepts and methods to a region that previously had little such exposure, marks a good and important start. The con-tinuation of basic stabilization efforts, the creation of inventories, and implementation of stor-age improvements must continue for years to come. Building systematically on these efforts will advance the decades of work that remain in Haiti's post-earthquake cultural recovery.

Photo by Richard Kurin/Smithsonian 186 CONSERVATION: PROGRESS AND CHALLENGES NOT FOR SALE OR REPRODUCTIONSEARCHING FOR ART IN THE NATIONAL PALACE DAWNE STEELE PULLMAN It was eerie. Our footsteps echoed down the corridor of the third fl oor of the National Palace in Port-au-Prince, the now deserted of ce and residence of Haiti's presidents. I imagined this architectural homage to the White House to have once been a buzzing bustling center of govern- ment activity and bureaucracy. We passed room after room void of desks, lamps, chairs, les, phones, and people that had been present only nine months before. Absent were the usual office paraphernalia and staff to run a country. Instead, now it was apparent that all was gone except for the odd le cabinet or lone chair left behind as a ghostly reminder. We were in search of paintings that had gone missing, since the country was starting to reclaim its cultural heri-tage after rescuing the living rst, then claiming bodies where possible, and now feeding its souls by seeking to preserve its cultural heritage, its art\u2014the outward expres-sion of this vibrant, colorful, and complicated country. Only ve of us from the Cultural Recovery Center had been allowed access to the National Palace and as we turned the corner to the president's private quarters we saw that the iconic columns of the loggia had been shifted to a drunken forty- ve-degree angle and the roof caved in ex- posing the blue sky. Walls had collapsed leaving a land-slide of plaster, concrete, and twisted wire mesh. Reaching our destination, only a gilded corner of a frame, which must have held the prized painting, poked up out of the six-foot-high pyramid of debris. Our hopes sank as there was no way we could unearth this artwork, except by re-moving one by one, and by hand, each chunk of rubble. This was not a wise option, considering the structural state of the building as well as the lives at risk. Reluctantly, we retreated in order to continue our conservation efforts of the 4,000 other artworks baking in the emergency storage containers back at the Cultural Recovery Center. SYSTEMATIZING DEPLOYMENTS ERYL P. WENTWORTH AND ERIC POURCHOT No conservation work in a disaster situation is really routine, yet the deployment of conservators, both by Smithsonian and AIC volunteers, became more regularized over the life of the Haiti Cultural Recovery Project. Chief Conservator Stephanie Hornbeck set priorities and created systems that gave more continuity to efforts. Training programs at the Center created a cadre of people, including talented local artists, who could work on larger-scale projects over extended periods of time. Conservation work shifted from conservation treatments on a few \"showcase\" pieces to larger-scale cleaning, stabilization, and storage projects. The storage containers began to empty out. At the same time, working and living conditions became more predictable, and FAIC was able to start sending vol- unteer conservators based on needed skills and expertise, beyond the small pool of 107 AIC Collections Emergency Response Team (AIC-CERT) responders. AIC-CERT coor-dinators Aimee Primeaux and Beth Antoine were able to schedule volunteers several months in advance based on Stephanie's work calendar. Given agreements in place with the Smithsonian, we de-veloped arrangements for the purchase of materials and supplies and for getting them to conservators to carry down to Haiti. Communication lines were always open, and over time, problems were solved and challenges met. A year after initiating the project the amount of work was still staggering in scale, but the partnerships, preparations, and systems were beginning to pay off. 187 CONSERVATION: PROGRESS AND CHALLENGES NOT FOR SALE OR REPRODUCTIONTHE CENTER'S PAINTINGS LAB VIVIANA DOMINGUEZ The paintings conservation atelier at the Haiti Cultural Recovery Center is up and running at full speed as if it has been this way for many years. It is hard to believe that this very well equipped lab was a timid almost empty room in June 2010. Every single painting to be conserved in this lab was severely damaged in the earthquake and in need of urgent care. The overwhelming and scary sight of these wrecked paintings has never intimidated the fourteen paintings conservators who have worked in the lab. Their ex-traordinary efforts are refl ected in the twenty- ve Haitian paintings that have received major restoration treatment. They have been helped by three skillful and dedicated Haitian artists now trained in conservation techniques, and serving as conservation assistants at the Center. I began to oversee activities in the paintings lab after completing the project to rescue the murals at Holy Trinity Episcopal Cathedral. I found Jean M\u00e9nard Derenoncourt and Franck Louissaint hard at work. These are two very digni ed gentlemen and professional artists who teach at the Ecole Nationale des Arts (ENARTS). They were retouching a very large, ve-foot by seven-foot portrait of an elderly Haitian woman. Her worried eyes, looking upwards, drew my attention to her earthquake-damaged forehead. One of the gentlemen handed me an old amateur photograph of the complete image. The woman's anguished expression made it seem to me that she'd anticipated the damage. The painting by Mario Benjamin, one of Haiti's leading contemporary artists, was rescued in two separate pieces by Patrick Vilaire and his team from the rubble of the Presidential Palace. Krist\u00edn G\u00edslad\u00f3ttir, a paintings conservator from Iceland reassembled the painting and with Jean M\u00e9nard and Franck, patiently repaired the fty-eight tears in the canvas. The team did a remarkable hand relining of this very large painting and re-stretching the canvas. They then in-painted damaged areas, bringing the piece back to life. The color reintegration of the large lacunae on the forehead and background presented a real challenge. I had to solve an ethical dilemma of how to resolve the large missing area. On the one hand, we had to respect the historical integrity of the piece and the earthquake has be-come part of the painting's history. On the other hand the missing area was too predominant for a \"purist\" approach, which would imply applying a neutral color. So I found an alternative. I stipple painted hundreds and thousands of small dots like Seurat's \"pointillism\" bringing the image back together. This treatment was the most complicated and longest treatment under-taken at the Center's conservation studios. Chief Conservator Stephanie Hornbeck regarded this project as evidence that advanced conservation work can be achieved in Haiti.

Nine students were selected by Center staff with the expectation that they would be hired to work on the iron sculpture collec-tion and other conservation projects. We arrived in Haiti on December 6, 2010, an inauspicious time to start a project. The next day, the announcement of results for the recently held presidential election led to demonstrations that shut down Port-au-Prince for two- and-a-half days. We felt safe in our hotel, but could not leave the prem- ises. We spent the time planning the training course and watching CNN for news of the local situation. Once we were able to begin work at the Center, we proceeded with the development of the iron treatment protocol and nal- izing the course. Training was carried out over two days, a much shorter time than we had hoped, but nonetheless, the training of the students in basic handling, assessment, documentation, and cleaning of the iron sculpture seemed successful. The trainees were an interesting mix of people who had either an art or chemistry background, and the dynamic of the group was provocative and engaging. It is our understanding that a number of these individuals went on to work with the ironwork recovered from the Centre d'Art and on other projects. Near the end of our stay, we went to the Croix des Bouquets area of Port-au-Prince where many of the iron- working artists have their studios. It was exciting to see that the tradition of ironworking not only continues but, in fact, thrives. The visit reaf rmed our optimism in the importance of cultural recovery in Haiti, in spite of the many obstacles.

My major project was reassembly of an orientalist-style statue of a female slave signed \"Bracony,\" probably the Italian-American sculptor Leopold Bracony. Made prin- cipally of white marble, it was apparently broken and shattered as tremors tipped the statue over frontward during the earthquake. Broken stone fragments were re-attached, as were undamaged flesh parts of the statue cast in bronze. We successfully found additional marble fragments at MUPANAH, but time constraints and the ab- sence of many photographs of the statue before it was damaged prevented replacement of some shattered and missing portions. For the Parliament building we began cleaning a plaster and bronze relief of the Haitian Act of Independence by Montagutelli and examined granite re-liefs by Drabanet from its Chamber of Deputies. Since the objects laboratory at the Haiti Cultural Recovery Center was well equipped by the time of our arrival, we were able to begin work immediately, and we worked long days. However, two weeks was too short a time period to complete work on both the MUPANAH statues and the Parliament reliefs. We estimate our contribution to the artistic recovery effort to be very small compared to the enormous need, but our desire to see cultural recovery continue is strong as a result of our experience. It was a pleasure to be part of the well-functioning Center and its committed Haitian staff, even for such a short time. We also enjoyed visiting the wall painting conservators, who were removing damaged mural fragments from the al-most completely destroyed Holy Trinity Episcopal Cathedral.

Alexandre P\u00e9tion (1770-1818), President of the Republic of Haiti from 1806 to 1818, is considered one of Haiti's founding fathers. During the quake, the bust of P\u00e9tion fell from the pedestal and landed on the gallery fl oor, its head shattering into pieces. The damaged bust was salvaged, and seven frag- ments were collected and boxed. Debris from the building's damaged ceiling tiles and fl ooring was also swept up and placed outdoors for eventual disposal. This would assume signi cance later on. When Carol Grissom and I, Smithsonian staff conservators, arrived at the Cultural Recovery Center in Port-au-Prince to assist in the conservation of art damaged in the earthquake, I chose to conserve the damaged bust of P\u00e9tion. I cleaned the broken shards of plaster using soft brushes and a vacuum cleaner, consolidated with dilute adhesive the loose plaster at the neck where the shards would attach, and dry- tted the existing fragments to assess the order in which I would need to reassemble them. Signi cant portions of the head were missing, including the right eye, left ear, and so large a portion of the top of the head that reassembly of the broken shards was rendered impossible. Rumor had it that there might still be additional shards belonging to the sculpture at MUPANAH. The Recovery Project Registrar Carmelita Douby accompanied us on a visit there. We discovered that the museum's stepped entryway was lined with low hedges where building debris from the earthquake had been deposited. Directed to search there for missing frag-ments, Carol and I looked quizzically at each other and began carefully combing through the pile of rubble. There we found many painted plaster fragments with curled and dirty black paint, some unmistakably parts of the P\u00e9tion bust, such as a left ear and a large brow-like piece with two eyebrows. In all, nine large painted plaster fragments and many small ones were unearthed. Although somewhat the worse for wear, the fragments we found proved indispensable to the recon- struction of the P\u00e9tion bust. I sized the porous edges of each fragment with a synthetic resin adhering them together with a heat-resistant adhesive incorporating the unearthed shards. The head of Alexandre P\u00e9tion began to take shape. After I had used all of the fragments avail-able, I lled voids left by missing shards with plaster of Paris, an inert and strong structural material. After seven days of intensive work, the sculpture was reassembled, ready for the nishing steps of lling and retouching remaining losses. Though incomplete, the restoration of this important historical likeness was enormously satisfying.

The materials consist of unique manuscript civil docu- ments\u2014records of births, marriages, divorces, deaths, cus-toms records, and newspapers, both bound and bundled loose documents. I was asked to organize general care and training for handling documents in advance of a planned air-conditioning retro t of the collections storage space. I also surveyed the overall environmental and space needs. Given the many challenges, including costs, both nancial and environmental for maintenance of a generator fueled air-conditioning system, I met with the architect-engineers from the Cultural Recovery Center, suggesting the feasi-bility of a more sustainable on-demand dehumidi cation and exhaust system for the already signi cantly aged ma- terials. My sharing of recent conservation research which acknowledges real-world conditions and strategies versus \"ivory tower\" theory was met with favor by our Haitian colleagues, who are familiar with shortages of budget, supply, and systemic maintenance. When asked about the most signi cant aspect of my expe- rience in Haiti, the word that immediately comes to mind is respect. I was happy to both give and earn respect from my Haitian colleagues at the Cultural Recovery Center and the National Archives during discussions, training, and dusty, hot, hands-on hard work\u2014all of which exercised my ability to rapidly adapt and offer solutions to diverse needs. One of my long-term recommendations is to include all the staff\u2014including temporary laborers, technicians, and the of ce staff\u2014in project discussions. That way, ev-eryone involved can understand the mission and goals, and hopefully appreciate and respect the value of each others' work. It also gives people respect for the collections them-selves, their value to the Haitian people, and to academics, researchers, and journalists, who will use the records to contribute to Haiti's own history and future. Another fun personal challenge included my surprise guest turn as a paintings conservator, due to discoveries made in the stacks at the National Archives of an extremely dam-aged painting on masonite by Stivenson Magloire. This work has a moving history, due to the circumstances sur-rounding the death of the artist, and for me to help bring it back together from fragments guided by the eyes of the gallerist, a friend of the artist, was very rewarding.

Photo courtesy of Vanessa Smith/SmithsonianAlmost exactly one year from when I had left I was asked to return again and arrived with much joy. So much had changed and so many things had improved both at the Cultural Recovery Center and within Port-au-Prince as well. All of the labs were lled with art and the courtyard was lled with shipping containers packed with art. The Cultural Recovery Center sent me to work at the Haitian National Archives and to the Haitian National Library. I spent my two weeks giving workshops, wrapping books, and working with other conservation professionals\u2014Haitian, Canadian, Japanese, and American. I even got to vacuum paintings again! \u2014Vicki Lee 194 CONSERVATION: PROGRESS AND CHALLENGES NOT FOR SALE OR REPRODUCTIONTREATING RARE BOOKS AT THE NATIONAL LIBRARY KATIE WAGNER Our project at the National Library of Haiti took place on- site at the library located in downtown Port-au-Prince. The library building remained sound after the earthquake but the stacks toppled like dominoes. As a result, the collection sustained considerable damage. The scope of the project was to clean and re-house the rare monographs and journals with the assistance of nine library staff members. The first challenge we faced was that the supplies we anticipated having at our disposal were not available when we arrived in Haiti. Some were in a container that had yet to clear customs at the airport and some had simply not been ordered. The second challenge was that the tropical climate of Haiti combined with the lack of a stable storage environment had led to the rapid deterioration of the collection. Many of the monographs consisted of paper so brittle that it was in shards. Without the boxes we had anticipated having at our disposal, we had to come up with an alternative way of re-housing these fragile items. We had brought in acid-free tissue paper and decided that the best way to ensure that the brittle shards remained together, and to fl ag items for future treatment, was to wrap the books in the tissue paper. Invaluable to the success of our project was the training that the staff of the National Library had received previ- ously by the paper conservator at the Cultural Recovery Center and from the ICCROM training course. We set to work cleaning, sorting, and re-housing 1,500 items in our two-week period. With the assistance of this well trained and hard working staff, we were able to meet our project goals and leave the rare collection in stable condition.

Upon arrival we were greeted by the soon-to-be familiar face of our driver pro- vided by the Cultural Recovery Center. The drivers who delivered us safely between several locations during our visit turned out to be capable and punctual, making it pos-sible for us to accomplish our rewarding task of cleaning and re-housing the 1,500-item rare book collection at the National Library of Haiti located downtown. In a nation suppressed by poverty and a devastating earth-quake, we discovered an oasis of enthusiasm and kindness within the Library, punctuated by an inspirational work ethic by their staff in order to achieve so much in just two weeks. Scenes on the streets were indeed troubling and local customs were baffl ing to us at times. The daily com- mute between locations was exhausting. Important sup- plies were limited. However, it was the optimism of those assigned to work with us that made the effort worthwhile. We are still in touch with the Library staff and hope that our efforts to stabilize their rare books, for eventual per-manent storage in a new environmentally-sound collec-tions space, continues to be a source of encouragement for these lovely people in support of the immense cultural treasures of Haiti.

NOT FOR SALE OR REPRODUCTIONA BEEHIVE OF ACTIVITY MARIANNE LEHMANN A few weeks after the earthquake Olsen Jean Julien, Manager of the Cultural Recovery Project, invited me and other Haitian cultural leaders to a meeting with experts from foreign cultural organizations to help gure out what we could do to save our cultural heritage. The exchange of ideas was very interesting and promising. Later, I was invited to participate in a three-week training session on collection management organized by the ICCROM, the Smithsonian and the Government of Haiti. Each day I learned something new. Practical work done in this course was very informative and useful to those of us who have collections. I realized that I could do a great deal to better preserve my collection of objects with little cost, while more extensive treatment would take considerable funds. At the end of the course, participants from the different Haitian cultural organizations were encouraged to propose a project relating to the care of their endangered collections. The Cultural Recovery Project would then select projects to implement and also provide nancial assistance for them. I recorded this information with satisfaction, careful not to re- joice too much, for as the Haitian proverb says, \" sa k nan vant kabrit la, se pou li ,\" which means once you have the means rmly in your hands, you can plan. Still, I hoped that my project would be selected. Miraculously, it was!Now, the house at No. 71 Rue Gr\u00e9goire in P\u00e9tion Ville, home to a collection of about 2,700 objects of the sacred arts of Vodou has been transformed into a beehive.

She has created a good working atmosphere and leads a well- spirited group of conservators who will nish the project on time. The Cultural Recovery Center is also working to fortify a storage area that will stand up to the weather and future earthquakes, and has provided a generator to so we have a dependable source of electricity. I am so thankful for the aid to my collection and the work of the Cultural Recovery Center in aiding Haitian cultural heritage generally. We have much to do. Currently, 369 works from my collection are in an exhibition traveling in Europe and to Canada so that we can raise funds for the construction of an Ethnographic Museum in Haiti. I hope too with all my heart that the Cultural Recovery Center can continue to operate for the good of Haiti's cultural heritage.

Shockey, Jr./ Smithsonian (left) and Corine Wegener (far left)CARING FOR THE CLOTH OF CULTURE SARAH SCATURRO As the only textile conservator on the Haiti Cultural Recovery Project, I worked on the important Haitian Vodou collection of Marianne Lehmann. Comprised of more than 3,000 objects, it features a large number of textile-based objects, including sequined and beaded flags, embroidered costumes, dolls, and a large group of life-size statues called Bizangos. The Bizangos, which were created by members of a secret society also called Bizango, include human remains and are covered in tightly stitched black and red fabric embellished with mir-rors. Used in Vodou ceremonies as warrior-like manifesta-tions of the Lwa, divine spirits, they, along with all other objects, were \"deconsecrated\" when they entered into the Lehmann collection. The collection was largely unaffected by the January 2010 earthquake\u2014a fact that some Haitians attribute to the power the objects still have. However, it was stored in con-ditions that endangered its long-term survival. I was able to train the team of Haitian technicians in how to handle, clean, and store textile objects so that work could con-tinue after my two-week assignment was completed. I also trained them to recognize the difference between \"bad\" dirt\u2014which needed to be removed since it was damaging to the artifact, and \"good\" dirt\u2014which was evidence of the object being used in a ceremony. While there were many challenges in working on this project\u2014space and time constraints, material shortages, no environmental controls, language barriers, and so on, the biggest challenge was the lack of reliable electricity. My main goal with the textile collection was to remove through vacuuming the decades' worth of dust, insect debris, and soot that blanketed everything, yet I only had access to electricity about twenty percent of the time! Therefore, I developed a different approach that involved using a soft brush and makeup sponges. Luckily, the day I left the much-needed generator arrived, so the team nally had reliable electricity. Having successfully conserved more than 170 objects, I left the project after two weeks with a strong sense of accom-plishment. More importantly, I played an important role in establishing the methodology on conserving textile-based Vodou artifacts through developing an excellent rapport with the team of technicians.

Due to concerns about security as stories of kidnapping and rape were reported in the media, we were virtually se-questered in our hotel. Pre-trip visions of communing with Haitian artists and sharing materials and techniques across disciplines were not to be realized. Our only real contact with Haitian people other than Cultural Recovery Center staff and drivers was by eye contact through a closed car window as we were shuttled to and from work in a locked car. Though these interchanges were usually positive, they were all too brief and ultimately frustrating. The realization dawned that relief work is full of unexpected hardships and deprivation of a human, even cultural sort. It is fraught with the boredom of restricted social contacts, the repeti-tion of hotel meals and routines, and emotional ups and downs of grief, outrage, and frustration. Perhaps worst is the worry that one is not doing enough, that the work is not valuable given the yawning need of a culture in trauma, that art is not the rst human priority. There was a wry sense of connectedness to relief workers and expatriates across the globe and throughout time, try- ing to bring something of value to a troubled place far from home and its norms. Perhaps the most valuable lesson stemmed from the chal- lenges of working with limited materials in a setting plagued by limited local resources, even within the relative oasis of functionality of the Recovery Center. Shortages of materials dictated that we save everything for re-use: card-board, plastic cups and bags, water bottles cut off to serve as vessels for brush-cleaning or plaster-mixing. Ingenuity is essential in a setting of scarcity, and we found pleasure in creatively adapting our saved/found materials to new uses. Necessity is indeed the mother of invention and that is the great reality and strength of the Haitian people. It took immersion, however brief and escapable, in a scenario of shortages and dif culties to really grasp the triumph of the Haitians, which is enduring resourcefulness and creativity in the face of loss. 198 CONSERVATION: PROGRESS AND CHALLENGES NOT FOR SALE OR REPRODUCTIONThe goal of the Haiti Cultural Recovery Program, working with the Foundation for the Preservation, Enhancement and Production of Haitian Cultural Works (FPVPOCH) is to complete an inventory of Marianne Lehmann's singular collec-tion of approximately 3,000 Vodou artifacts and create a searchable database that includes key information such as object number, name, dimensions, material, function, and location as well as an object image. In addition to assigning numbers for tracking and identi cation, the objects in the collection must be cleaned and organized by type, size, and material in order to maximize the limited amount of space available for storage in the Lehmann house where the col-lection is currently stored. I assisted with this project in July 2011. During my two weeks at the Lehmann house, I worked with the FPVPOCH team to create an Excel database to record object catalog information, making sure that all important data elds were represented. I also reviewed the team's object numbering system and made recommendations for clearly numbering object components and sets of objects with multiple components. This is especially important when documenting related objects, for example, those used in the same ceremony. Working on the Marianne Lehmann Vodou Collection was not without its challenges. The balcony, which offered the only available work space, was crowded and exposed to the elements, and the building's open windows have left the collection covered in decades of dirt and dust. Electricity was intermittent, which was problematic since most objects required vacuuming. The project at times seemed overwhelming. Still, the Haitian team showed me that meaning-ful work can be accomplished under dif cult working conditions with limited supplies. The progress made in two weeks\u2014365 objects processed\u2014has left me optimistic that the entire 3,000 object collection can be processed by the year's end.

[Lower] Treating items in the Lehmann collection. Photos by Bethany Romanowski/SmithsonianThere are probably tens of thousands of things that have been damaged. When you think that even in a normal year a conservator typically works on a few hundred objects not many of which require major treatment, you get a sense of how long it is potentially going to take to restore Haiti's material culture. \u2014L. H. (Hugh) Shockey, Jr. 199 CONSERVATION: PROGRESS AND CHALLENGES NOT FOR SALE OR REPRODUCTIONA SURVEY OF AUDIO-VISUAL CONSERVATION NEEDS PETE REINIGER I went to Port-au-Prince one year after the earthquake to survey selected audio-visual collections. Though by no means a complete survey of the country, the sites I visited provided a look at the range of impact the earthquake had on collections and at the current state of audio-visual preservation. While much content is of popular and non-Haitian materials, all the collections contain some important Haitian cultural and political documentation such as performances, Vodou ceremonies, and political events. Held by organizations including a lmmakers' association, radio and television stations, as well as individuals, they largely lack curation and most are not well-catalogued. Some were severely affected by the earthquake, others minimally or not at all. All are aware of the need to preserve their media holdings. Current storage of physical collections varies and no site I visited is able to provide recommended best practice environ- mental conditions. Collections most impacted by the earthquake need the most urgent attention and triage due to damage from dramatic environmental change including media physically falling from shelves, exposure to dust, moisture, mold, heat, and relocation. Needs include: \u0081 Prioritization of what to preserve based on clearly established criteria such as cultural and historical signi cance; \u0081 Training people to work with each media type, its physical characteristics, how to safely treat it in the analog and then bring it into the digital domain. Training in international standards and best practices; \u0081 Video and audio cleaning equipment and supplies and for repackaging physical media; \u0081 Operational \"legacy\" equipment to play back older media; \u0081 Digital equipment and software; \u0081 Best possible storage of the analog sources after transfer; \u0081 Cataloging system(s); \u0081 Secure, managed storage of audio and video data and assurance of backup and off-site redundancy. The integrity of each collection needs to be retained; \u0081 Controlled access to data with attention to use and intellectual property rights. One idea for minimizing expense\u2014as funding is a real issue\u2014is to form a coalition of committed organizations to work with the Haiti Cultural Recovery Center and pool resources such as equipment and technical expertise. The National Archives or some other warden of national heritage might be included as a possible digital repository while assuring appropriate control of access and use of individual collections to their owners. Hopefully, this will become an opportunity to move forward with preservation of important audio visual materials in Haiti. Such preservation is of concern worldwide as technology rapidly changes and older media deteriorates. The earthquake has heightened those concerns in Haiti.

Archives and libraries throughout the world have declared that lm, video, and audio collections are deteriorating so rapidly that a vast record of human experience from the twentieth century is disappearing. The question for me as I toured television and radio stations in Port-au-Prince was how much remained after the earthquake. The good news is that many historic recordings are kept by the broadcasters; the bad news is that circumstances keep these recordings from being used and preserved. In the cramped air-conditioned studios, producers are creating content on contemporary broadcast formats; but on the shelves in small side of ces there are thousands of rare LP records and analog audio and videotape recordings waiting to be resurrected. At Radio Lumiere a friendly electronics engineer showed me audio decks that he had xed in his immaculate workshop, us- ing his special skills and an elusive part from the United States. There was another pile of equipment that is all but useless, that no amount of engineering know-how could x in a poorly resourced country like Haiti. In the TV control room at Radio M\u00e9tropole the staff held a lively conversation about the march towards everything digital; being behind the curve is not always a bad thing when trendy technologies decline in price over the course of a year. But the cost of even two-year-old technology is often beyond the capability of poor broadcasting stations. On the staff patio at Radio Antilles Internationale with a mango tree dropping its ripe fruit just a few feet away, we delved into the concerns of cataloguing the sounds and sights contained on fragile magnetic media. Access to expertise in the library and archives eld is infrequent, so some of the most cost-effective and ef cient means of capturing data and mak- ing it accessible via the Web has not come to Haiti. On my second to last day in Haiti I led a group of broadcast professionals in a custodial exercise at the National Television of Haiti; we spent an afternoon wiping off dust and grime from over 500 vintage political tapes, and removing the red \"re-cord buttons\" from the tapes that will prevent them from being accidentally erased when they are placed into a playback deck. Afterwards, we celebrated a worthwhile accomplishment in the television's canteen with delicious Haitian coffee and Prestige beer. One thing that Haiti does not have a shortage of, it seems, is collegiality and good will among professionals.

Photo by Pete Reiniger/Smithsonian 201 CONSERVATION: PROGRESS AND CHALLENGES NOT FOR SALE OR REPRODUCTIONA CONSERVATOR'S JOURNAL MARK ARONSON My experience was but a brief two week stay as an AIC volunteer painting conservator in Port- au-Prince. It was rewarding and thought provoking. My fl ight to Haiti was uneventful. I met fellow conservator Vicki Lee in Miami and we left on time and fl ew without a bump to Port-au-Prince. I was pleasantly surprised by the sounds of a live island band that greeted us as we de-planed and approached the terminal shuttle bus. The day was warm, sunny and the mood sprightly. The pleasant beat made the wait worth-while. The terminal was just barely lit and the baggage conveyor not running, so our bags were handed through several windows at once. Somehow retrieving suitcases was a cacophonous snap\u2014as if my bags knew where to nd me. I hardly had to look as I was suddenly just stand- ing on them. Running the gauntlet of of cial and unof cial porters eager to help with my bags was easy, though I was amused by touts approaching arriving passengers with rolled up paintings to sell. I couldn't think of another country where this would happen\u2014and it occasioned a quick refl ection on Haiti as a visually rich society with such big problems. What would my two bits accomplish here? We found our driver, Erikson Pierre-Louis, without me parting with a proverbial tip. I felt poorly that I was not emphatically solicited and had not taken the opportunity to support the local economy. Erickson drove us directly to the Cultural Recovery Center in Bourdon where I met the staff. I was introduced to Olsen Jean Julien, Project Manager, of the Haiti Cultural Recovery Center, Robine Melse, the of ce assistant, and then Viviana Dominguez, my boss for the week, and two Haitian artist/conservators Franck Louissaint and Jean M\u00e9nard Derenoncourt. Viviana, Vicki, and I sat down for lunch and I was confronted with my rst two rule violations; a lovely green salad and iced water. \"Yes, you can eat this and drink that,\" I was promised. Lovely. I was given a tour of the Center and was really taken aback. I had expected a hardship post\u2014 warnings about electricity and furniture shortages. In reality I found a clean, well-lit, and air-conditioned building. While not plentiful there was a goodly amount of modern conservation supplies and two stereo microscopes. Obviously many hurdles and problems reported in the early months of the project had been taken care of. I was introduced to colleagues, including two conservation students from the States. I saw a bunch of the painting projects underway and the ones I was asked to treat. Yikes. We took off down the hill for hotel check-in and dinner. Like the Recovery Center, the Plaza Hotel was way more hotel than I had expected\u2014a pool, palm trees, fans, a pleasant bar and restaurant, rooms with air-conditioning, or at least a reasonable interpretation of air-condi-tioning, and hot showers for seven of my eleven days. There was live music at the outdoor bar two nights a week! The hotel garden, as with many urban hotels, is a bit of a green oasis and during my two weeks I was able to tick off a modest list of birds including Hispaniola woodpecker, Hispaniola bull nch, Vervain hummingbird, Grey fl ycatcher as well as Zenaida and Mourning doves. It is a bit of a different picture directly outside the gates of the hotel. Between the hotel and the destroyed National Palace, just three blocks away, is a sprawling tent city occupied by thousands of people displaced by the earthquake. It's rough and tumble just outside the door. There is also a handicraft market just across the street, and it is worth a look see. I became enamored with the bracelets made from downed utility cables. 202 CONSERVATION: PROGRESS AND CHALLENGES NOT FOR SALE OR REPRODUCTIONI had good luck with the weather, though it rained a couple of times and you could see it storming elsewhere (lovely lightning zinging across a cloud darkened sky,) I did not get caught by bad weather during my visit. Because it was rather dry the mosquitoes so many reported as problematic were not present in great number or simply not interested in me. I did not nd it necessary to wear repellent either at the Cultural Recovery Center or in the Plaza Hotel. However, I did develop a funny bumpy rash on both arms, from my elbows to my wrists; it did not appear to be the result of munching creatures but was more likely caused by some type of contact dermatitis. Though everyone was rather impressed with it, the rash struck me as small beans. As of this writing, I have both arms, can still type, and the bumps are just about gone. Earnest work began Tuesday morning. Viviana Dominguez directed the activities of all the painting conservation team. She reviewed the project goals with me and then put me to work. Though the project goals did not emphasize aesthetic reintegration my conversations with Viviana were informed by the many badly damaged early Italian paintings I had treated and those experiences helped me better appreciate the damaged Haitian paintings. My two weeks had two phases, a very active treatment phase during week one and then during week two, when Viviana was stateside, I added a bit more project management and organization to my days. I found Louissaint and Jean M\u00e9nard were terri c colleagues, very skilled, observant, methodical, and patient. It was easy to discuss treatments with Viviana and Louissaint in English, start the work and then as it progressed we let Louissaint and Jean M\u00e9nard carry forward many tasks leaving me to think about other pictures and try and keep the documentation up to date. We periodically assembled as a group to review the work, decide what was going right, and what processes could go better or to change. I made periodic visits to the paper lab where Saori Kawasumi and Erntz Jeudy were reassembling a large painting on mason's board by Stivenson Magloire which had been blown into many pieces. We discussed methods, the ideal solution and materials, and then that which we had on hand and could live with. My biggest project during the week was a long oblong canvas by an artist named Bourmand Byron. It was a na\u00efve depiction of the rural countryside. The damages were several fairly long tears, one straight and one rather jagged, but thankfully there was very little associated paint loss. It was already off its stretcher and areas around the tears had been consolidated. We set to work drawing the open tears closer together, using blue painter's tape, and then improvised a \"Dutch\" method, pulling the two sides of the tear closer and closer together with brown Kraft paper and wheat starch paste and water. While drawing the major tears together we also realigned smaller tears and punctures, and mended them with canvas bers and a white glue emulsion. We did a variety of fl attening and distortion removing procedures with moist blot-ter and weights\u2014to help align the torn fabric, close the tear and bring the picture to a more planar state. I left Jean M\u00e9nard and Louissaint to do the lion's share of the jade ber mend- ing as they had obviously spent many hours doing this before and their work was quite good. Though working faster than I would normally, we managed to piece the canvas together and line the picture by hand, using a plain old Black & Decker steam iron and BEVA 371 to polyes-ter. Louissaint lled the minor losses and retouched the work by the time I left Port-au-Prince. While there I also worked on several other pictures, one by Max Pinchinat, another by Herve Telemaque, and a third by Gesner Armand. The Telemaque was least damaged, though its appearance was quite chalky perhaps caused by concrete dust and debris. There was much fl aking along the perimeter and a certain amount of loss within the picture plane. This was consolidated with Lascaux consolidating adhesive and lled before I left. A whimsical, abstract 203 CONSERVATION: PROGRESS AND CHALLENGES NOT FOR SALE OR REPRODUCTIONpainting by Gesner Armand on mason's board had snapped in two and required gluing. Vicki Lee helped begin the treatment by tting the two halves together and consolidating loose paint along the edge. Working with the methods Saori and Erntz were using on the large panel in the paper lab we mended the break and then applied a canvas support across the back with BEVA 371. The losses were lled by Jean M\u00e9nard and then retouched. The picture by Max Pinchinat was the most damaged canvas I worked with. This abstract por-trait was painted with much thick paint. It was seriously whacked by the earthquake, suffered several large, distorted tears and much loss of paint. The painting was encrusted on the back, a sign of some burial, and there were loose and displaced fl akes of paint just about everywhere. After Louissaint and Jean M\u00e9nard consolidated the picture for a day, we humidi ed the picture to try and bring it back into plane before mending the tears. The rst humidity treatment only brought the picture so far. There was still much active fl aking and I had to leave a next phase of treatment for the next group to tackle. SOME OTHER THOUGHTS My rst week was spent doing much treatment and learning the skill set held by Louissaint, Jean M\u00e9nard, and Junior Nor\u00e9lus. Once Viviana left I found myself directing a variety of treat-ments and making sure they were productively busy. I enjoyed several lengthy discussions with Saori Kawasumi regarding the progress of her and Erntz's treatment of the Magloire. We imag-ined how we might treat the painting in her Buffalo, New York studio, versus in a museum or private studio and then in Haiti, using what we had on hand. While I came down expecting to just do treatments or surveys or whatever was asked of me, I was surprised to be doing some managing, discussing projects, and training. Towards the end of my second week, e-mails from Stephanie Hornbeck and Viviana asked me to plan treatment activity for the Haitian conservation team who would be working without a states-side conservator for a couple of days. The Haitians I met in the Recovery Center were caring, engaged, and skilled. The training they had, the projects they had accomplished in the months before my short stay, and their eye and hand skill made this an easy and comfortable task. We discussed the treatment work they would do, and when I left I did so with complete con dence in their ability and direction. They were enthusiastic about their art and made it clear to me, we were not conserving single objects but parts of an entire culture. Throughout my two weeks our discussions brought to the fore my thoughts about the kind of work we were trying to do in Haiti and what and how we might do treatments differently if we were at home in the States. If we do a different kind of work, how should it be different and why? Those of us at home, especially in larger institutions, are used to an almost limitless number of supplies, alternatives, and even with our deadlines, more time. The adage about perfection being the enemy of good came to my mind several times. Oh how I wish I had learned to do a paste lining in school! In Haiti, anything like BEVA or Lascaux adhesives must be imported and must be very dear. Yes of course glue paste has its issues with propensity to grow mold, but really might it be an equally valid method, given the circumstances? I also realize that conservators in private practice probably see a lot more of profoundly damaged art work than I do in a museum lled with paintings that just don't see a lot of this type of damage. The conversations the Haitian artists/conservators had during the day were a joy to listen to, even though I had not much idea what was said. They spent time looking at the Center's coffee table books on Haitian art, took \"photocopies\" with their camera phones of the paintings they 204 CONSERVATION: PROGRESS AND CHALLENGES NOT FOR SALE Estim\u00e9 review repair techniques for a Gesner Armand painting on masonite board. Photo by Mark Aronsonliked, as they don't have copies of these books, nor photo copy machines. Snapping pictures with their cell phones seemed to do the trick. They discussed whatever it was they were dis-cussing enthusiastically and I could tell they were eager for the conversation. I advised future conservators deployed to Haiti to bring down more books on Haitian art, either for the Center or for Haitian colleagues. I am sure they would be appreciated. I also advised conservators ar-riving at the Cultural Recovery Center to take a good visual picture of all the supplies available in each of the labs. Several times during my weeks I came across things I wish I had known were there earlier in my stay. Another suggestion, try and nd some ways to spend a bit of time out of the hotel. I had a friend in Port-au-Prince and she took me to the Oloffson Hotel for the weekly Ram concert, which is both a pleasure and experience. To see and meet some of the scores and hundreds of twenty-somethings down in Haiti working for this or that NGO, \"dot-gov,\" or \"dot-org,\" partying down to great live music every Thursday night puts you in touch with some of the other relief efforts going on, and it's another nice place to eat and relax. Port-au-Prince is not a place with many plain old tourists, and I felt completely comfortable walking up to any foreigner and just asking them \"so what are you doing here,\" and that almost always led to an interesting story, and an occasional surprise and second question \"really? You are Haitian?\" And one more bit\u2014if you dare, the barbecued chicken on offer from street vendors, just near to the now closed Museum of Haitian Art, is truly delicious. I had a rewarding time, and would surely go back. I learned a lot, and thought a lot about our \"stuff.\" I go to disaster planning meetings at work and nd the conversations often so abstract and institutional. We live in one of the richest of museum cultures and replete with hefty budgets, and can get so worked up about the \"what ifs,\" can make mountains out of ant hills, and too often project a gloomy picture over minor disadvantages and problems. My time in Haiti offered me a reality check with regards to our work back home. 205 CONSERVATION: PROGRESS AND CHALLENGES NOT FOR SALE OR REPRODUCTIONFAILURE AT THE NATIONAL CATHEDRAL: NO VESTIGE OF THE SACRED KESLER PIERRE For months I sent e-mails introducing myself to anyone I could nd who was connected with the effort to preserve Haiti's cultural heritage and particularly the surviving stained glass in the otherwise devastated National Cathedral. In October 2010 the Smithsonian's Richard Kurin sent me back to Haiti to do an in-depth survey of the remaining stained glass and help devise a plan of action for its emergency conservation. Olsen Jean Julien, the Manager of the Cultural Recovery Project, obtained proper permission for us to enter the Cathedral and arranged a meeting with Reverend Eric Toussaint. I included Florence and Georges Celcis, who own and operate a stained glass studio in Haiti. The ve of us met at the Cathedral, along with two structural engineers. A partial fence erected along the south side of the building did little to impede access. Reverend Toussaint commented this was his rst time inside the ruin since the earthquake. As we stepped inside I could hear a saw being used somewhere in the Cathedral. \"There are things in here we'd really like to preserve,\" the Reverend said. We all stood a moment, taking in the landscape of razed concrete. Eyes moved up to the jagged roof fragments dangling above. \"Okay, let's get out of here,\" was the next sentence, and we all stepped back outside. The engineers said they would be able to stabilize the area so the work of removing the stained glass could be done in relative safety. After some more discussion, we said our goodbyes and I went back inside the Cathedral to take photos. Further into the ruins I found people were busy cutting, smashing, and prying loose anything saleable. Some of them were literally climbing the walls and balancing themselves on exposed sections of rebar. After being lucky enough to have survived the earthquake, they were risking their lives for the meager sums of money they would collect for scrap metal. All this was going on with no interference from any authority. It was clear these people were the only continuous presence the Cathedral had seen in the ten months since the catastrophe. I saw there were fewer windows now than there had been in February and they hadn't been lost to the elements. I was in a race. I spent three days at the Cathedral counting, mapping, and photographing windows. When I returned to the U.S. it took me longer than I would have liked\u2014about ten days\u2014to assemble the report, which stressed the immediate need to secure the site. Olsen submitted the report to the Catholic Church authorities and I was told steps would be taken to protect the ruins. This was the rst week of November. There was talk we might be ready to begin the actual removal of the stained glass by February 2011. I began to relax; it was really going to happen. Then in January, a couple of days after Haiti's Independence Day celebration, I received a call from a Haitian friend who told me all the Cathedral windows were gone and there was a rumor they had been stolen at gunpoint. Stolen at gunpoint? There were eighty or so large windows. How many days would this great stained glass heist have taken? I tried to picture it\u2014armed glaziers with scaffolds making a quick getaway in trucks carrying large fragile glass panels\u2014it didn't sound like a very likely scenario to me. I searched the Haitian media on the Internet and found no mention of such an occurrence.I wrote Richard and Olsen to ask if they'd heard anything. Was all the art glass really gone? A couple of days later Olsen let me know that all but the most inaccessible glass was gone, but no one seemed to know what had happened. I guess the Church's bureaucracy is no less time consuming than government's, because it turned out security guards didn't make it onto the site till the last week of December and, apparently, by then it was too late. I returned to the Cathedral in April, intending to talk to the homeless people who basically live outside the church. I had developed relationships with these people during my visits; I'd brought them food and taken their pictures. They would de nitely know what happened to the windows. 206 CONSERVATION: PROGRESS AND CHALLENGES NOT FOR SALE OR REPRODUCTIONLooters at work at the National Cathedral. Photo by Kesler Pierre 207 CONSERVATION: PROGRESS AND CHALLENGES NOT FOR SALE OR REPRODUCTIONWhen I got there, asking questions turned out to be unnecessary because I found the process of stained glass removal still underway. There were a few guys. They had climbed up the wall and were smashing the glass with a hammer to get to the lead. Next they would pull the metal frames from the wall. They told me they had worked their way through all the windows and now they were working on the highest ones. These were the last few left. I photographed the men at their work. From their perspective they were only doing what was necessary. They took the ini- tiative; making use of debris that no one else appeared to have any interest in, and at considerable physical risk. I looked around, there was no sign of any security, no sign of any Church presence; the metal scavengers' work continued unhindered. I couldn't help but feel this would have been less likely to happen had the site not been left so abandoned. A wall around the perimeter and guards would of course have been great, but it might have been enough of a deterrent just to have people on the premises working to stabilize the ruins and clear the rubble. It might have been enough, if it just looked as though something was happening, as though someone cared. It might have been enough just not to have left it sitting here like a trash heap for a year. It's complicated, I know. In the wake of the human tragedy, with all the emergent needs of the people that weren't being met, that have never been met, you can't expect the Haitian populace to indulge in the luxury of caring about art, or about a building. But there are people in the Haitian government whose job it is to care. And these windows had value; the Catholic Church should have cared. In the entire organization of the Catholic Church was there no one who could have taken the time to look inside their own Cathedral and see that it was being pulled apart? Did they really need me to fl y in from New York, ten months into the crisis to do that for them? Did they really need me to recommend security? Given the lack of concern over the deterioration of the windows before the earthquake, the apathetic behavior on the part of the stewards of these artworks is hardly surprising in its aftermath. However, in this moment, the world was poised to help with funds and volunteers pouring in; it is amazing to me that somehow this was still not enough to spur action. The world at large was more interested in saving Haiti's cultural heri-tage than the Haitian authorities were themselves. One of the metal scavengers had a section of stained glass panel. I asked him if I could take a look before he smashed it. Perfectly willing, he handed it over. After all this time I was nally holding one of the Cathedral's panels in my hand. I looked at this remnant of what I'd been trying to save for years and thought, with virtually nothing left to preserve, the best thing I could do now was be a witness and record what happened. I held the section of stained glass up and photographed it, and then I handed the panel back to the man who valued it only as scrap lead. Still, for a moment, I considered paying the men to not break the little glass that was left. I could buy a few more days, maybe even weeks\u2014but at this stage\u2014what would be the point? It was over; the race was lost. Looking around the desolate space now, I felt no vestige of the sacred, for me at least, it was gone. I felt as though I were standing inside a huge carcass whose bones were being picked clean. If this goes on long enough, there will be nothing left of the Cathedral at all. 208 CONSERVATION: PROGRESS AND CHALLENGES NOT FOR SALE OR REPRODUCTIONStained glass panels at the National Cathedral before and after the earthquake.

One could only imagine going back 200 years, when much of the world regarded Haiti as a pariah nation, one whose people had boldly and bravely fought Napoleon to achieve their independence and also put a rm end to the slavery which had brutalized them. Then, many in the world\u2014particularly those slave-holding and trading peoples had only loathing and maybe even fear of what Haitians had done. It is now of course very different, with Haitians integrally part of the human family. The earthquake demonstrated the fragility of life and society, clearly in Haiti, but also for all people everywhere. It didn't take much imagination to be awestruck with how the earth could wreak such damage and devastation upon its inhabitants. But if the world's heart went out to the Haitian people, its mind marveled at their strength, fortitude, and resilience in the face of disaster. There was, in the aftermath of the earthquake a profound respect for the victims in their basic act of survival.CHAPTER TWELVE PROJECT IMPACT IN HAITI AND BEYOND For nearly eighteen months, our two institutions have worked together on the Cultural Recovery Project. I have closely followed its work and welcome the results. More than 30,000 cultural artifacts saved! My greatest joy comes from saving the murals of the Holy Trinity Cathedral.

Photo by Ken Solomon 212 PROJECT IMPACT IN HAITI AND BEYOND NOT FOR SALE OR REPRODUCTION213 PROJECT IMPACT IN HAITI AND BEYOND NOT FOR SALE OR REPRODUCTIONPatrick Delatour, Leslie Voltaire, and many other Haitian leaders developed the initial plans for Haitian relief and recovery to which, by April 2010, various donor nations and organizations had committed more than $9 billion. An international organization\u2014the Interim Haiti Reconstruction Commission\u2014composed of Haitians and donor nation leaders was put in place to collect the funds, to assess the worthiness of differ-ent projects, and to transparently dispense funds and evaluate project impacts and consequences. As reported by many sources, the process has not worked as hoped. Pledges of funds have not turned into cash; and when they have come, it has often been via a slow and cir-cuitous route. The Commission's structural viability has been questioned and its work has been hobbled by political and bureaucratic challenges, not the least of which was a delayed presidential election in Haiti. Only a small fraction of the funds have been disbursed, and on the ground, Haitians remain homeless and job-less. While a signi cant amount of the rubble has been cleared, schools, roads, and the country's infrastructure have seen little improvement. The cultural sector mirrors much of the larger situ- ation. The outpouring of appreciation for Haiti's cul-tural resources and empathy for their possible loss or endangerment from the earthquake was resounding and widespread among cultural organizations worldwide. UNESCO, ICOM, ICOMOS, IFLA, ICA, International Blue Shield, and closer to the affected region, Caricom, all made statements\u2014heartfelt ones, with concerns for Haiti's historical buildings and cultural sites, collections, living traditions, and cultural industries. Some help for Haiti did come very quickly. UNESCO provided boxes for disbursed and damaged books and papers, as well as a small amount of fencing to protect cultural sites from looting. Caricom sent in emergency conservation sup-plies, so Haitian archivists and libraries could protect and preserve materials. Other organizations sent delega-tions to assess the situation, the damages, and propose a course of action. Though well-intentioned, most efforts suffered from want of quickly available funds. There was sim-ply no money to accomplish any cultural relief effort of any scale. Cultural organizations are always relatively poor, and always raising money. They do not have large amounts of spare funding unrestricted from govern-mental allocations or donor purposes, to devote to an unpredictable tragedy. Many organizations scrambled to raise money quickly. UNESCO put out an announce-ment for a flash appeal, raising about $ 400,000. ICOMOS tried to raise funds through donations. The International Committee of the Blue Shield sought commitments from various governments and founda-tions, but it took months and months to get even rela-tively small pledges. In the delays, its ambitious large scale and totally unrealistic cultural recovery project to rescue books and archives had to be increasingly trimmed back until it disappeared. The U.S. was no exception. The U.S. Department of State did not have a fund for cultural relief or recov-ery. U.S. AID did not regard cultural work as part of its humanitarian assistance mission. Originally, several advocates sought $ 10 million for cultural recovery in the Haiti supplemental appropriations bill to present to the U.S. Congress. That was cut in half and then even-tually to $2 million due to skittishness about includ- ing \"an arts project\" in such funding because it might engender political debate and thus distract attention from passing the larger $ 1.5 billion appropriation. In the end, those U.S. AID funds came through to sup-port the Haiti Cultural Recovery Project, but had we not had the $276,000 so generously donated from The Broadway League, there would not have been a project. The failure to have in place a cultural relief fund for disasters is remarkable. Just now, after more than eighteen months since the earthquake, UNESCO has released its request for approximately $ 23 million for Haitian cultural recovery projects. Even if successful, it is likely to take months, if not years to raise the funds, at which time work can be planned and eventually start. It is way too long a delay. The other drawback to putting plans into place quickly revolved around the organizational match-ups, in Haiti and with various international organizations. Haiti's cultural world, not unlike that in other nations, is divided between a public, governmentally controlled sector, and a private sector, with the latter ranging from governmentally recognized foundations, cooperatives, Due to our experience with the Haiti Cultural Recovery Project, I have no doubt that Broadway will respond similarly in the future. \u2014Charlotte St. Martin, The Broadway League 214 PROJECT IMPACT IN HAITI AND BEYOND NOT FOR SALE OR REPRODUCTIONand non-profit organizations to private individuals, informal groups and commercial enterprises. All were affected by the earthquake and faced as well infrastruc-tural and other challenges both pre- and post-disaster. Putting in place plans to deal with the non-govern-ment sector is daunting. The churches constitute a huge number of significant buildings, possessed not only of historical architecture, but also work, such as the Biblical murals of the Holy Trinity Episcopal Cathedral, which are popularly regarded as national treasures or of great public interest. In Haiti, the non-government institutions\u2014the Centre d'Art, the Nader Museum and Gallery, the Museum of Haitian Art at the College of St. Pierre, the Lehmann Collection\u2014possess the lion's share of paintings, sculpture and objects of art. Private libraries, like that of George Corvington, are signi cant. Audio-visual holdings are widely distributed, particu-larly among private individuals and groups. The government cultural sector too, while under the jurisdiction of the Minister of Culture and Communication, is divided among various organi-zations\u2014ISPAN, the National Library, the National Archives, the National Museum (MUPANAH), and the National Bureau of Ethnology. There is nothing inherently problematic about this\u2014 in fact, in nor-mal circumstances it helps focus mission, resources and operations. The organizations are largely autonomous, and given the authorities involved in appointing or removing directors, the Minister has limited powers. They are also terribly under-resourced, so that even prior to the earthquake they suffered from budgetary allotments inadequate to their tasks. Staffs were thin, facilities worn, particular types of expertise absent, and labs, storage, and project funds lacking. Hence, overall, the government organizations have limited roles vis-\u00e0-vis the coordination of private entities, and among them, coordination and concerted action are not a given, but rather have to be forged in particular cases and circumstances. After the earthquake, with the loss of staff, vehicles, and equipment, and the destruction of or damage to facilities, it was even worse. In coming to Haiti's cultural aid, international orga- nizations reached out to their known colleagues and to seemingly cognate agencies. All of the international organizations agreed there should be a coordinated means of developing and implementing plans with the Haitians, but that route was not clear. UNESCO expedi-tiously called a meeting in mid-February 2010 to which it invited many of the organizations likely to help. But it didn't form an International Cultural Committee com-posed of three Haitian and seven non-Haitians until June. That Committee\u2014of which I was a member, had few meetings and precious little realistic discussion\u2014and it wasn't until over eighteen months later that UNESCO's proposal on what it sought to do was released. That is far too late. And it was startlingly too little. UNESCO offered a mere proposal largely to talk and plan, and not how already planned, vetted, reviewed, and funded activi-ties were ready to be implemented. While the proposal did call for some training and capacity building in Haiti, and some improvements to actual cultural collections, facilities, and events, much of it is devoted to preparing Haiti to implement UNESCO treaties. Because of UNESCO's slow movement in the cul- tural arena, other organizations sought action, not talk. In Haiti, that was not easy because there were a variety of people to talk to given the relative autonomy of the government cultural agencies and of course the range and diversity of private cultural organizations. In many cases, the issue of prior relationships and trust emerged to the fore. Haitians became suspicious of disaster tourists, professionals from international organizations included. \"How many more assessments do you have to do, and how many more reports do you have to write before you do something,\" was a common refrain among Haitians. While many Haitians could not tell if an interna- tional organization was serious or not, could be trusted or not, so too was the inverse true. A number of Haitian cultural leaders talked passionately about the impor-tance of cultural relief and recovery, but didn't seem to have the foggiest notion about what to do or how to do it, to the point that some even reveled in it as theme and actually obstructed viable efforts. Others vied for control over potential funds and resources with their colleagues, mirroring professional jealousies and inter-necine battles. In several cases, demands for payments in return for cooperation seemed suspiciously like the solicitation of bribes. 215 PROJECT IMPACT IN HAITI AND BEYOND NOT FOR SALE OR REPRODUCTIONThe Haiti Cultural Recovery Project succeeded in this challenging environment, though at numerous intersections it looked like it might not. It succeeded because as a necessary condition it had a very clear goal\u2014save Haiti's endangered material collections. Its means was clear\u2014establish a Cultural Recovery Center in Haiti, use Smithsonian and other volunteer conservation experts to do the work and to train Haitians along the way. That however was not suf cient. The project suc- ceeded because it brought financial and technical resources to the table. There were funds and people to undertake concrete actions. It also succeeded because of trust\u2014a key group of infl uential Haitian cultural leaders had a good experience in working with the Smithsonian in 2004 for the production of the Smithsonian Folklife Festival program on the occasion of Haiti's bicenten-nial. People knew each other. They had worked together in the past on a signi cant, positive undertaking. They could trust each other. That trust was used as currency, almost like a voucher system, to reach out beyond that relatively small group of Haitians to others in the cul-tural sector. This was particularly important in the pri-vate sector, where people were entrusting their most valuable treasures to the Smithsonian for care and treat-ment. Finally, the project was successful because it had blessings from people at the top, who wanted to see it happen. Through partnership with the President's Committee on the Arts and the Humanities, and the encouragement of the First Ladies of both the U.S. and Haiti, the project had the requisite moral support it needed to help move obstructions and obstructionists to the side. Clear goals and means, adequate funding, trust among partners, and high level encouragement posi-tioned the Haiti Cultural Recovery Project for suc-cess. Realizing that success took an immense amount of incredibly hard work by the staff of the Haiti Cultural Recovery Center, the work of Smithsonian and American Institute for Conservation conservators and staff, the managerial ability of Olsen Jean Julien, the conservation expertise of Stephanie Hornbeck, and the diplomatic skills of Corine Wegener, and many, many others involved with the project.What next?As we were initiating the Haiti project, the Smithsonian received a call from colleagues in Chile where a 9.0 magnitude earthquake had struck. Could we help with their cultural relief and recovery effort? Through the life of the Haiti project, we've seen the massive flooding of the Indus Valley in Pakistan, the looting of museums and archaeological sites in Egypt during the Arab Spring uprising, the earthquake-tsu-nami and nuclear disaster in Japan, and the debilitating fl ooding caused by Hurricane Irene in New Y ork, New Jersey, Vermont, and other parts of New England. In all of these cases there was help to deliver, if it could be clearly defined, focused, funded, and prop-erly delivered. Y et, the truth of the matter is that since Hurricane Katrina's ravaging of cultural sites and col-lections in New Orleans and the Gulf Coast, and the debacle of the looting of the Iraqi National Museum, neither the U.S. nor the world has made much prog-ress in guring out an effective response to human and natural disasters that threaten our heritage. This is a lesson we seem to repeatedly fail to learn.On the governmental level, a solution is compli- cated. For the United States, when there is a domes-tic crisis, FEMA, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, is the lead actor. If libraries or museums or local historical societies and theater companies are damaged and endangered by say massive fl ooding, they might typi- cally report to state agencies which then coordinate with FEMA to develop rescue, relief, and often with other agencies, such as the Department of Interior, grant or loan programs that can help them get back on their feet. Internationally, if it is humanitarian crisis, as most natu-ral disasters are, such as in Haiti, the U.S. Department of State is the lead agency, and it mobilizes other U.S. departments and agencies and coordinates with inter-national organizations such as the United Nations. If the crisis is one of confl ict\u2014such as war\u2014then the Department of Defense plays the lead role. T ypically in such crises, cultural issues revolve around avoiding bomb-ing or military action involving heritage areas, military or police protection of museums, libraries and archaeo-logical sites, the prevention of looting and interdiction of stolen national treasures and other cultural property. 216 PROJECT IMPACT IN HAITI AND BEYOND NOT FOR SALE OR REPRODUCTIONAbsent the equivalent of a U.S. Department of Culture, there is no one U.S. entity which coordi- nates matters when a crisis threatens cultural resources, domestically or internationally. Whatever the crisis though, at some point FEMA, the Department of State, and the Department of Defense call upon governmental cultural agencies and/or non-governmental organizations and experts to help plan or carry out speci c work. T oo often the pathways for doing this have to be recreated anew with every crisis. Funding requests have to justi ed, resources secured, and agreements crafted. It simply takes too long to put arrangements in place so that partners can be mobilized and actions pursued on the ground. Thankfully, as a direct result of the Haiti proj- ect, there has been some movement in this regard. The Department of State has authorized the Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs to initiate an of - cial process to create a mechanism for integrating cul-tural heritage into that agency's emergency response decision-making process with regard to humanitarian disasters in foreign countries. It has also authorized the Bureau to convene representatives from Federal agencies to discuss the creation of an interagency task force on cultural heritage at risk in such situations that could not only coordinate government efforts, but also mobilize private, non-governmental organizations. Additionally, the Smithsonian has had initial discussions with the National Defense University in an effort to place cul-tural heritage matters on the training agenda of military of cers serving in crisis situations. While these are positive developments, the wheels of government turn slow. Entrenched bureaucracies, agency silos, and narrow ways of thinking have impeded progress toward establishing a viable cultural emergency response operation. The cultural sector can and should learn from others. In the health care field, M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res or Doctors Without Borders has gured out how to respond quickly to crises. It has funds in place to mobilize immediately, a network of workers and volunteers to call upon, and agreements with coun-tries to operate. While cultural crisis work is signi cantly different than providing emergency health care to individuals it can adapt its best practices. First, what is needed is not a cumbersome bureaucratic organization, but rather a flexible, ready and able network of cultural \" rst responders.\" In any particular situation it could be one or other cultural agency taking the lead role as coordinator\u2014depending upon the particular expertise required and nation or region afflicted. In one crisis it could be UNESCO, in another ICRROM or ICOMOS or the Blue Shield; in the U.S. it could be the National Archives, the Smithsonian or the Library of Congress, or others. Second, there should be an extant fund to draw upon immediately during a crisis to support cultural rescue, relief, and recovery operations. Third, there should be pre-existing ties between this cultural relief network and national governments and international or regional agencies, so that its efforts can be easily activated and readily coordinated. Simply, to do the work quickly, well, and ef ciently, we cannot take months and months negotiating agreements and raising funds. Lastly, any such organized effort has to keep in mind the prize\u2014to save cultural sites, materials, and living traditions, and enable those of the culture to be better able to carry, care for, and extend that culture into the future. We have a lot of work to do\u2014and as Cori Wegener so poignantly reminds us, \"the time to plan for the next disaster is now.\" 217 PROJECT IMPACT IN HAITI AND BEYOND NOT FOR SALE OR REPRODUCTIONLEAVING THE FOG BEHIND OLSEN JEAN JULIEN We did not lose our way in the fog of the earthquake which threatened to overwhelm us. Instead, through the Haiti Cultural Recovery Project we made steady progress. Though beset by difficulties and challenges, we built an institution\u2014the Cultural Recovery Center in a matter of mere months, setting up conserva- tion labs and studios, bringing in equipment and supplies, forming a great staff, and establishing the support services, infrastructure, work routines, and protocols that made it ef cient and productive. We coordinated scores of Haitian, American, and international conservators and experts. We succeeded in recovering tens of thousands of items of our cultural heritage\u2014murals and architectural features, paintings and sculptures, artifacts, rare books, and archival documents. We made signi cant improvements to cultural institutions, public and private, and trained more than 100 Haitians in conservation and collection management. The project was a true partnership that brought together a combination of diverse strengths and resources. Intense commitment, communication, and effort among these partners were an absolute necessity when it came to plan- ning, mobilizing, organizing, and implementing the proj-ect\u2014and realizing our success. I was also lucky enough to be accompanied in this journey by some truly talented and experienced people who sin- cerely committed themselves to the project. Together, we were able to leave the fog behind and pave the way for the future. While there are many challenges still ahead of us to recover our cultural heritage, we now have the experience and accomplishments to move forward with full con dence in our ultimate success. CULTURAL CONSERVATION: A SOURCE OF DIGNITY MAGDALENA CARMELITA DOUBY GUILLAUME The earthquake that devastated Haiti has weakened if not destroyed cultural institutions already in need of recognition in a country where everything is classi ed as an urgent priority. How to spend the few resources available to recover artworks and cultural institutions, while the affected population still lives in tent cities, while medical care is a luxury, while famine and lack of care gut children?Our cultural heritage and creativity are valuable sources of dignity. It is our culture that gives the Haitian people the courage to survive and dream of a better life. It is a duty we owe to ourselves and our descendants to preserve it. The Haiti Cultural Recovery Center took on part of this re- sponsibility. It was a challenge, but also a victory. Day after day, we built a true relationship with our public and private partners to protect the collections that represented and embodied the heritage and creativity of the Haitian people. When we started, the need for recovery was huge and urgent while the conservation infrastructure, the ma- terials, and resources did not exist. With the help of the Smithsonian, the AIC and others we learned, invented, and adapted ways of saving our cultural heritage. About 30,000 objects were stabilized and restored, and many cultural in-stitutions made stronger through the introduction of tech- nology, facilities, equipment, and skills. The Haiti Cultural Recovery Project is a testimony to a national and international synergy of competence and de- termination to confront a daunting challenge. Many things are still to be done, but the project stands as a concrete way to meet our preservation needs and as a model for other such efforts in the future. 218 PROJECT IMPACT IN HAITI AND BEYOND NOT FOR SALE OR REPRODUCTIONHELPING HAITI FACE THE FUTURE MICH\u00c8LE D. PIERRE-LOUIS There is a basic paradox in Haiti's cultural sector. On one hand we have artists and artisans with an unfathomable creativity, possessed of an energy that de es time and the burdens of daily life and who give Haitian culture its entire characteristic splendor. On the other hand, we give very little importance to the process of cultural management\u2014making inventories, classifying, maintaining and conserving collections, regulating and scheduling these tasks. So, when the disastrous earthquake hit, we were caught off guard and doubly surprised. First, the wealth of our capital\u2014as measured in history, memory, art, and culture was virtually de-stroyed. At the same time, we found ourselves unprepared and impotent to deal with the cul-tural crisis at the scale needed to save our heritage before it disappeared. Cultural ignorance, contempt, even inertia also played a role. Thus we have seen vandalism at the Palace of the Ministries, the pillaging of the windows at the National Cathedral, and looting of other important, symbolic sites. It was as if in this ruined capital, added to the natural disaster and desolation, were acts of self-mutilation of an important part of us, our collective memory. It was to the heart of this matter that the Haiti Cultural Recovery Project intervened. The international organizations bound to Haiti by conventions and partnerships mobilized im-mediately, aware of the irreparable losses and desiring to help us save what we could. The Smithsonian Institution took the leadership of this movement, and given its strong relation-ship with Haiti and experience in the eld of collections conservation, obtained the necessary authorizations from the Government of Haiti to get to work. The results are clear for all to see. Thousands of cultural objects that otherwise would be sad memories have been saved. They have been treated, carefully and patiently, as if to recognize that they have a soul. There surely is in all these artistic creations, books, documents, and ar-chives, something in nitely precious, a memory, something that recalls Haiti's unique history and yet also speaks to us in a wide-ranging universal way. We have developed a cultural recovery infrastructure over the past eighteen months, and we must, at all costs, preserve the knowledge and know-how we've gained. We are also appre-hensive about ensuring the sustainability of this effort in a long term institutional framework. We not only have to take stock of the work done, but also assure that this work continues, so that not only can our heritage be preserved, but that our creativity, forged out of the present chaos, can help us face the future. 219 PROJECT IMPACT IN HAITI AND BEYOND NOT FOR SALE OR REPRODUCTIONTHE NEXT STEPS PATRICK DELATOUR, OLSEN JEAN JULIEN, AND RICHARD KURIN From the beginning of the Haiti Cultural Recovery Project we were always mindful of how it might be sustained beyond the eighteen-month emergency period. For one, we knew that the damage caused by the earthquake had endangered tens of thousands of artworks, artifacts, and Haitian national treasures. Treating and restoring these items would entail the work of a generation. Furthermore, even with the stabilization of Haiti's material culture, there would always be an on-going need for conservation work. This is not something you do once; stewardship requires continual care and attention. Under Olsen Jean Julien's leadership, the Haiti Cultural Recovery Center had various legal experts examine ways in which the project could be incorporated into a Haitian governance structure and still retain its fl exibility for involving and working with other national, foreign, and international organizations as well as receiving scal support from the broad- est range of sources\u2014government allocations, philanthropic gifts, intergovernmental grants, and even earned revenue. Discussions with and among Olsen, Ministers Patrick Delatour and Marie-Laurence Jocelyn Lass\u00e8gue, and Richard Kurin explored various possibilities. We were all mindful of the central importance of meeting the conservation needs of both public and private collections in Haiti and ensuring the creation of a cadre of Haitians trained in the conservation arts and sciences. Our expectation was that the Haiti Cultural Recovery Center would evolve into a new kind of public institution, attached to the government through the cultural sector, but with strong ties to tourism, education, and public works. It would have the legitimacy of a solid governmental unit, with the ef cacy and fl exibility of a robust, service-oriented non-governmental, non-pro t professional organization. Delays in the presidential elections in Haiti and the ultimate formation of a government and cabinet occasioned con-comitant delays in the development of the future plans for the Haiti Cultural Recovery Project. As the clock ticked down on the formal end of the project, Patrick Delatour met with Cheryl Mills, Counselor and Chief of Staff to U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, in Washington. Cheryl headed the U.S. relief and recovery effort for Haiti. Patrick sought Cheryl's support for the continuity and transition of the project. Cheryl, who has visited Haiti often and is immersed in its recovery effort, was amenable. How could we assure a positive, sustainable outcome for the project? We went to work again and we envisioned options where the Haitian Government would gradually assume the full man- agement of the project in the near future. Richard met with Cheryl and U.S. AID of cials and outlined a proposal. The Minister of Tourism, Patrick Delatour, was able to offer a historical gingerbread building and its grounds near the Presidential Palace and Champs de Mars, managed by the Ministry of Tourism, as a new home for the project. This would provide ongoing government support. The building, currently known as the \"Maison du Tourisme,\" would require an extensive restoration, installation of climate control, eradication of termites, and out tting for conservation labs and studios. A storage facility could also be built on the property, and Olsen and Patrick immediately drew up plans. Richard and Olsen developed a budget and terms of commitment, so that the Haitian government could support basic facilities maintenance, security, and staff costs, the State Department/U.S. AID could support the building restoration and project transition costs, and the Smithsonian transitional management and conservation/training costs. We envisioned that private sources could also be tapped for programmatic costs\u2014to support ongoing training and special projects. A workable plan for a modest $2 million investment over a two-year transition period was developed and is now in the process of consideration. If it comes to fruition, the important work begun by the Haiti Cultural Recovery Project will continue to grow and have important impacts throughout Haiti. If it doesn't, a back-up plan to create several storage units at key cultural sites will assure that the items treated and saved by the project can at least be safely and securely stored by the cultural organizations who own them, so that the marvelous conservation work done in the wake of the disaster will not have been done in vain. 220 PROJECT IMPACT IN HAITI AND BEYOND NOT FOR SALE OR REPRODUCTIONThe gingerbread \"Maison du Tourisme\" on land near the Presidential Palace has been designated by the Ministry of Tourism for the future home of the Haiti Cultural Recovery Center. Photo courtesy of Olsen Jean Julien 221 PROJECT IMPACT IN HAITI AND BEYOND NOT FOR SALE OR REPRODUCTIONHERITAGE: AN INVESTMENT FOR HAITI'S FUTURE PATRICK DELATOUR Heritage is a creator of value. All over the world, tens of millions of people come to see Machu Picchu, Angkor Wat, the Taj Mahal, the pyramids of Egypt, the Vatican, the Statue of Liberty, and the Robben Island prison of Nelson Mandela. Thirty million people visit the Smithsonian's museums to see its collec-tions; eight million visit the Louvre. From these visits people learn about history, art, technology, the values, and works of their fellow man. No less is true in Haiti, where the Citadel, Sans-Souci, Ramiers constitutes a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and educates and inspires visitors with the story of Haiti's struggle for indepen-dence and freedom. We have more to do here, such as the creation of a National Historical Park truly integrated with roads, facilities, and ports, so that the region can be a magnet for domestic and foreign visitors and provide a livelihood to guides, transporters, restaurateurs, artists, artisans, and performers who can bene t in extraordinary ways by a vital and robust heritage industry. Similarly, the recovery and restoration of our collections, our art, artifacts, books, and other treasures can inspire and educate the Haitian people. Our children need to have access to these resources, whether in their classrooms, through textbooks and other media, or in the places they visit. Exposure to our heritage will excite the imagination and surely result in new creations and creativity that bene t society. Restoration of historic buildings, the \"Wall,\" museum collections, and exhibitions can also help draw the attention and respect of tourists. These items of our heritage have value to fuel a new Haitian cultural economy. If we give them up, we lose our historical investment in their value, and squander an opportunity. Instead, we need to embrace our heritage as a resource for the benefit of future generations. 222 PROJECT IMPACT IN HAITI AND BEYOND NOT FOR SALE OR REPRODUCTIONLESSONS FROM HAITI ERYL P. WENTWORTH The Foundation of the American Institute for Conservation (FAIC) has been honored to bring our expertise to assist in saving Haiti's cultural heritage, yet other events during 2010 and 2011 have raised major questions about the role of the U. S. in international cultural emergencies. The earthquake in Chile and the tsunami in Japan had American Institute for Conservation Collections Emergency Response Team (AIC-CERT) members and American conservators asking if we should, would, or could be involved. The answers aren't simple. In addition to the obvious issues of funding and logistics, there are cultural and language barriers to be bridged. Several models have been proposed, ranging from an endowment for AIC-CERT for emergency deployments, to creating a cultural analog to \"Doctors Without Borders\" that would mobilize anywhere in the world. Complicating these ideas are the regulations and laws that limit what the U.S. government can do internationally\u2014FEMA, the State Department, and the Defense Department all have roles, but there is no clear authority for assisting other countries when their material culture is at risk. Discussions are underway to clarify federal roles and responsi-bilities, but it's unclear how any decisions made will affect response efforts of NGOs. The AIC-CERT program was designed to be a team of collections specialists who could respond to domestic emergencies quickly, safely, and effectively. Funds for training, upkeep of team members, and deployment are primarily from U.S. government sources, such as the Institute of Museum and Library Services, the National Endowment for the Humanities, the National Endowment for the Arts. FAIC will continue to make the 107 trained AIC-CERT volunteers available as widely as resources allow. Volunteers staff a twenty-four-hour hotline (202-661-8068), and provide advice by phone and e-mail, and stand ready to provide hands-on expertise, and often supplies, at no expense to the collecting institution. International requests, however, will always have to be considered on a case-by-case basis and only in partnership with other organizations. FAIC depends on those who can serve as liaisons with national and local authorities, along with other international responders. Before agreeing to an international deployment, we must be sure that our team members will be safe, have housing and local transportation, and will have people looking out for their welfare on the ground. The success of this model was made eminently clear to me when I joined a \"site visit\" to Haiti in June 2011. Surrounded by an island still devastated by the disaster, the Haiti Cultural Recovery Center was the embodiment of hope for Haiti's future. Haitian artists were working side-by-side with visiting conservators to document, assess, stabilize, and treat the art that refl ects Haiti's heart and soul. The dedicated teamwork that made this possible stemmed from the partnership of the Smithsonian, the U.S. Committee of the Blue Shield, and FAIC\u2014each bringing valuable expertise and experience to join with those in Haiti who will ensure their art both survives and is reinvented in response to disaster and recovery. 223 PROJECT IMPACT IN HAITI AND BEYOND NOT FOR SALE OR REPRODUCTIONCONSEQUENCES FOR CULTURAL RECOVERY CORINE WEGENER It is difficult to view the success of the Haiti Cultural Recovery Project without looking through the lens of past failures, such as the looting of the Iraqi Museum and Hurricane Katrina, just to name two. Even with international outrage over the looting, the cultural heri-tage community failed to provide any emergency response for the Iraqi Museum until months afterwards. There simply was not a cultural heritage NGO capable of elding an emergency response team and the same is still true today. After Hurricane Katrina, museums and collec-tions were only gradually acknowledged as part of the recovery effort. However, these failures also raised awareness about the risks to cultural heritage from armed confl icts and natural disasters. Organizations such as the U.S. Committee of the Blue Shield and American Institute for Conservation Collections Emergency Response Teams were created, leading to a partnership with the Smithsonian and the Haiti Cultural Recovery Project. What lessons did we learn from working in Haiti? First, even in the midst of a catastrophic disaster, people value their culture because it gives them hope for the future. Second, you cannot begin disaster planning after the disaster. Experts must be on call, funds must be available, equipment and supplies must be on hand. Third, assistance must be timed to the situation\u2014not so soon that it interferes with the humanitarian aid effort, but in time to save valued cultural resources. Finally, we must work side-by-side with local and national authorities, even if that slows things down\u2014in the end, the cultural heritage belongs to them and they must set the priorities. What about the next disaster? Here are a few recommendations based on my own experiences from Iraq to Haiti. At the international level, the United Nations must acknowledge cultural heritage as part of disaster response in their \"cluster\" system and the International Blue Shield must create an independent organization devoted to cultural property emergency response. The same holds true in the U.S. For domestic disasters, culture is now more recognized with FEMA's Incident Command System, but we still need better coordination and clear leadership in the absence of a U.S. Department of Culture. When the U.S. is involved internationally, whether in an armed confl ict, peacekeeping, or humanitarian relief operations, we must also take protection of cultural heritage into consid-eration\u2014it is a legal requirement in the 1954 Hague Convention as well as U.S. domestic law. The Haiti Cultural Recovery Project provides one possible model, with an organization such as the Smithsonian Institution playing a leading role. NGOs like the U.S. Blue Shield would also have an important coordinating role to play. Regardless of which organization leads, there must be a full-time staff with funds to carry out the cultural protection mission. Anything less will be ineffective and may even create an unrealistic expectation for assistance such as what we experienced in Iraq. In the face of increasing threats from political instability, armed confl icts, and disasters caused by global climate change, the U.S. must begin to incorporate cultural heritage considerations into planning for contingency operations. The time to plan for the next disaster is now. 224 PROJECT IMPACT IN HAITI AND BEYOND NOT FOR SALE OR REPRODUCTIONCULTURE IN CRISIS: FUTURE U.S. RESPONSES RACHEL GOSLINS We expect and hope that the impact of the Haiti project on future cultural recovery efforts by the United States will be lasting and profound. Too many times, defending and preserving a country's cultural assets is the last thing to be prioritized in a time of war or tragedy. And yet the cultural artifacts of a country\u2014its paintings and sculpture, its antiquities and historic documents\u2014are one of the few things that are truly irreplaceable. Protecting them is essen-tial to preserving the spirit and history of a people, and their ability to tell their own story to future generations. With this unprecedented collaboration between U.S. federal cultural agen-cies, the Haitian government, the private sector, and the NGO community, the Haiti Cultural Recovery Project has proven that it can be done\u2014that with enough political will, creative use of resources, and plain determination, the United States can play an essential role in safe-guarding a country's cultural legacy. Everyone loves a success story, and this one could not be more inspiring and unequivocal. Often the beginning of a project can be the most exciting part\u2014its lofty goals and high hopes still unsullied by the slings and arrows of factors beyond our control. As a project wraps up, one frequently nds oneself celebrating partial success and ruefully shrugging off the grand expectations of the early days. But the Haiti Cultural Recovery Project has been one of those rare and wonderful instances where the reality has exceeded the expectations, where its suc-cess transcends even the hopes invested in it at inception. Replicating this success will not always be easy, or even possible. In this case, we were fortunate to have found the perfect mix of ingredients\u2014a universally understood tragedy, a unique and concrete opportunity to help, strong leadership in the form of the Smithsonian, and a network of potential partners who had the courage and vision to step up when asked to do so. And while every situation that comes afterwards will be different in its particulars, the impact of our project in Haiti will be felt for many years to come. The clarity of its mission, the demonstrable achievements of its execution, and the alliance of partners, both domestic and international, who came together to make it happen will pave the way for more efforts in this area in the future, which will bene t us all. Rachel Goslins is the Executive Director of the President's Committee on the Arts and the Humanities, an advisory Committee to the White House on cultural issues. 225 PROJECT IMPACT IN HAITI AND BEYOND NOT FOR SALE OR REPRODUCTIONAPPENDIX ONE HAITI CULTURAL RECOVERY PROJECT TIMELINE 2010 JANUARY 12 A 7.0 magnitude earthquake strikes Haiti, centered in the capital region. 13 Haitian cultural workers begin to salvage thousands of paintings, books, and documents at various cultural sites. 13 UNESCO, U.S. Department of State, Smithsonian Institution, and other organizations begin to gather reports and document the damage and destruction of cultural sites. 23 Patrick Vilaire, a Haitian sculptor, cultural worker, and curator is quoted in a New York Times front page article as he tries to save damaged rare books from the rubble in Port-au-Prince. 24 Richard Kurin, the Smithsonian's Under Secretary for History, Art, and Culture begins to communicate with the State Department over a possible role in Haitian cultural relief and recovery work. 29 Richard Kurin convenes a meeting of various Smithsonian staff to discuss possible ways of aiding Haiti's cultural recovery.
