It sparked further questions in my mind: What was the connection? Is magnesium deficiency a widely known problem? Is there a basic, underlying mec hanism which is failing for lack of magnesium, or is magnesium involved in so many processes that it influences just about every disease there is? These unanswered questions quickly led to my selection of the magnesium mineral for this research project. In fact, this topic has been so fascinating that I am embarking on my own supplementation trial, and I plan to submit my personal test results and supplementation regimen as an addendum to this paper. Magnesium is vital to humans and other living organisms . Magnesium will be explored for its role in life processes and how it is supplied , and why it should be . Also, causative factors for magnesium deficiency will be examined , as well as its manifestation s in various common disease states . Testing options and dietary and supplementation recommendations will be given to ameliorate the threat to vitality which low magnesium levels pose to the human body. WHAT IS MAGNESIUM? Magnesium is a mineral, which is defined as 'an inorganic compound of natural occurrence.' In its simplest definition, an inorganic compound is one that does not consist of the element carbon, indicating that it is not deriv ed from living matter. (Wikipedia.org ) Magnesium, along with calcium and others, is also termed an 'alkaline earth metal,' due to the presence of two electrons Steele 2 in its outer shell in its element form. Because of these two valence electrons, magnesium reacts easily with other elements, and is found in nature only in compound form (dictionary.com ). Essential in all living things, magnesium is the ninth -most abundant element in the universe (ancientminerals.com ), the eighth -most abundant element on the face of our planet , and the third - most plentiful ion in seawater , after sodium and chloride (Czapp ). Magnesium is also the fourth - most abundant mineral in the human body , (ancientminerals.com ) and it is the second -most prevalent mineral at the intracellular leve l (Dean 12) . When present to such a great degree, there can be no question that magnesium is responsible for many vital, life -sustaining processes. Its importance in preventative and curative therapeutics has long been recognized by traditional Chinese healers: the Chinese ideogram for magnesium consists of the symbols for \"mineral\" and \"beautiful ,\" and magnesium is known to them as \"mei,\" the beautiful mineral (Sircus xiii) . THE ROLE OF MAGNESIUM As one of the six macrominerals of the body, magnesium is required in over 700 enzymatic reactions , and body processes too numerous to examine in great detail within this paper . Its role , however, is multifaceted: magnesium is responsible for energy production, transport, enzyme activity, DNA and other cellular structure, nerve conduction, and much more. Working in concert with one another, magnesium an d calcium are antagonists of one another, to create balanced electrolyte systems. Magnesium also helps to hold calcium in solution, rather than allowing it to form a precipitate, which tends to calcify structures. Witho ut proper cellular structure, there i s no body and w ithout cellular energy and function , there is no life. Is it any wonder, then, that m agnesium is also known as 'the spark of life ?' The Role of Magnesium: ATP and Energy, Transport, and Signal Transduction . Magnesium is a cofactor for th e enzyme adenosine triphosphate (ATP). ATP is created in the mitochondria Steele 3 within our cells, and is the main source of energy for the body. ATP must be bound to a magnesium ion to form MgATP, in order to be biologically alive. This is perhaps the most impor tant function of magnesium, because ATP is made in each of the 100 trillion cells of the body. ATP is formed from the food we eat (carbohydrates, fats and proteins), in a series of chemical reactions, collectively referred to as the Krebs Cycle. Seven out of ten of the Krebs Cycle enzymes are dependent upon the presence of magnesium (Dean xiv) . Aside from providing energy, ATP functions in signal transduction and transport as well. A cell is highly responsive to specific chemicals in its environment. For example, hormones are chemical signals that tell a cell to respond to a change in conditions. Molecules in food or aromas communicate taste and smell through their interaction with specialized sensory cells. Signal - transduction pathways, or cascades, media te the sensing and processing of stimuli. These molecular circuits detect, amplify, and integrate diverse external signals to generate responses such as changes in enzyme activity, gene expression, or ion -channel activity (Berg et al. ). ATP , formed with th e aid of magnesium, is used in various signal transduction pathways, which are further defined as sets of chemical reactions in a cell that occurs when a molecule, such as a hormone, attaches to a receptor on the cell membrane. The pathway is actually a cascade of biochemical reactions inside the cell that eventually reach the target molecule or reaction (dictionary.com) . Transmembrane ATP imports substances necessary for cellular metabolism and exports wastes and toxins across cell membranes for removal. A hydrogen -potassium ATP pump, or gastric proton pump , acidifies the contents of the stomach for proper digestion. In addition, there are many other pumps and transporters in the body, all of which are directed by ATP with magnesium as the necessary cofac tor (Dean xiv) . For magnesium for the enzyme adenylate cyclase. This enzyme converts ATP to cAMP and Steele 4 pyrophos phate; cAMP is used for intracellular signal transduction of the effects of hormones such as gl ucagon and adrenaline into cell, because the hormones are unable to pass through cell membranes. cAMP is also involved in the activation of protein kinases which in turn perform the function of adding a ph osphate group to other proteins. In this way, protein kinases orchestrate the activity of almost all cellular functions. For example, protein kinases are used to regulate the effects of adrenaline and glucagon (Dean xv) . Apart from ATP, magnesium is a cofactor for the enzyme phospholipase C (PLC). PLC is a class of enzymes which split phospholipids at the phosphate group, thereby creating signal transduction pathways, among other things. In addition, magnesium is an important intracellular signaling molecule in its own right (Dean xiv) . In summary, it becomes clear that magnesium is necessary for the actions of ATP as a power source for the body, as well as directs and coordinates cellular intake of nutrients and waste removal, and even helps to build the very transduction pathways themselves, as we ll as assisting and performing in the signaling processes, which are used to orchestrate cellular reactions . A beautiful mineral, indeed! The Synthesis of Proteins, DNA and RNA . Magnesium is a requirement for the structural integrity of numerous body prote ins. To date, 3,751 magnesium receptor sites have been identified on human proteins. Magnesium is also required for structural integrity of nucleic acids and is therefore needed for RNA and DNA synthesis (Dean xiv) . It is responsible for control and differ entiation of cell division, as well. Considering that our bodies replace old or damaged red blood cells alone at the rate of roughly 200 billion per day (Sakharoff ), this illustrates the great need the body has for available magnesium. Nerve Conduction and Muscle Function . Magnesium is intimately involved in nerve conduction. It stabilizes muscle and nerve cell membranes, which decreases the excitation of nerves and Steele 5 contraction of muscle cells. The mechanisms of this are varied, and include oxygen uptake, electrolyte balance, and energy production. Magnesium allows muscles and nerves to function properly: present within the cell at a ratio of 10,000 times more magnesium than calcium, it allows some calcium into the cell to cause nerve conduction or muscle c ontraction, then pushes calcium out of the cells to allow for a relaxation phase. Without this modulation by magnesium, nerve cells would be overstimulated by calcium to a point of death, and muscles would go into uncontrollable spasm resulting in tissue damage, as in heart attack (Dean xvi) . Calcium and Other Ion Channels . Magnesium i s directly involved in calcium channels: it jealously guards ion channels which allow calcium t o enter and leave the cell, and orchestrates with precision the exact amount of calcium that is needed for the required excitatory process within the cell, then flushes calcium out to prevent excessive excitation within the cell. Magnesium is considered a natural calcium channel blocker, as opposed to the pharmaceutical type prescribed by medical doctors, which have many side effects. In addition to directly regul ating calcium channels, magnesium is a enzyme keeps calcium channels open, allowing calcium to enter the cell as a second messenger. In smooth mus cle, cGMP is the signal for relaxation, which can regulate vascular and airway tone, insulin secretion, and peristalsis. Magnesium also regulates other ion channels, most notably that of sodium and potassium. Magnesium aids the process of potassium transport across the cell membrane. (Dean xv) Antagonist, Keeps Calcium In Solution . A key function of magnesium is as a calcium antagonist at the biochemical level. Calcium and magnesium share equal importance in our bodies, and neither can act without th ere being a reaction from the other. The activity of many enzymes Steele 6 depend on a sufficient amount of intracellular magnesium \u2014approximately 10,000 times more than calcium \u2014would be negatively affected by small increases in levels of intracellular calcium. Magnesium is also necessary to keep calcium in solution in the body, and prevents calcium from becoming inappropriately deposited in soft tissues , a process known as calcification . As long as there is sufficient quantity of hydrochloric acid in the stomach, adequate amounts of calcium can be absorbed from foods; however, once calcium leaves the high acid environment of the stomach and enters the alkaline small intestine, magnesium is now needed to keep calcium in a soluble state. Without sufficient magnesium , calcification of the cells and tissues can occur at the cellular level, causing various serious health problems (Czapp) . MAGNESIUM: WHO NEEDS IT? William Faloon, in his 2005 article \"How Many Americans Are Magnesium Deficient?\" attempts to scratch the su rface of this far -reaching issue. He writes that \" The latest government study shows a staggering 68% of Americans do not consume the recomm ended daily intake of magnesium. Even more frightening are data from this study showing that 19% of Americans do not consume even half of the government's recommended daily intake of magnesium \" (Faloon) . The National Academy of Sciences found that most Americans are possibly magnesium - deficient (qtd. in Dean 23) . For reasons not fully understood, the body does not retain magnesium very well; certainly not as well as it holds onto calcium or iron, for example (Czapp) . Even so, t he hard numbers are not in yet . As will be seen in later sections, there is some difficulty when it comes to differentiating the symptoms, testing for an d treating magnesium deficiency, as well as the willingness to spend research dollars to study its effects. A clearer concept of exactly who may be experiencing magnesium deficiency can be obtained by Steele 7 examining risk factors, symptoms and disease proc esses, as outlined by Carolyn Dean, ND (see Appendix). Indeed, it appears that this list applies to most people , if not to all. WHY ARE WE MAGNESIUM DEFICIENT? The problem of magnesium deficiency is multifactorial. Starting with mineral -deficient soil and spanning all the way through to our modern lifestyle and the overuse of pharmaceuticals in allopathic medicine, various factors combine to create the perfect storm of low magnesium levels in the human body. Bacteria - and Magnesium -Deficient Soil , Erosion a nd Acid Rain . The following statement , taken from the 1936 Senate document 264 as excerpted in The Magnesium Miracle by Dr. Dean reveals the state of our soil and food supply at that time: Do you know that most of us today are suffering from certain dangerous diet deficiencies which cannot be remedied until depleted soils from which our food comes are brought into proper mineral balance? The alarming fact is that foods (fruits, vegetables, and grains) now being raised on millions of acres of land that no long contain enough of certain minerals are starving us \u2014no matter how much of them we eat. The truth is that our foods vary enormously in value, and some of them aren't worth eating as food. Our physical well -being is more directly dependent upon the m inerals we take into our systems than upon calories or vitamins or upon the precise proportions of starch, protein, or carbohydrates we consume. Laboratory tests prove that the fruits, vegetables, the grains, the eggs, and even the milk and the meats of to day are not what they were a few generations ago. No man today can eat enough fruits and vegetables to supply his stomach with the mineral salts he requires for perfect health, because his stomach Steele 8 isn't big enough to hold them! And we are turning into a na tion of big stomachs (Dean xvii-xviii). Kirkpatrick Sale, independent scholar and environmentalist, wrote about American agricultural practices in the June 5, 1995 edition of The Nation magazine, describing the assault on farmland by the post -World War II American farmer as having a similar approach to the warfare with machines and chemicals that was waged on the battlefield. This war on the land occurred because farmers were lured into the belief that killing pests and weeds was far superior to living in harmony with nature. The whole experiment backfired when it became apparent that using poisons on the soil indiscriminately killed essential nitrogen -fixing bacteria and worms, and the soil became dead and non -porous. Worms are needed to break up the earth and provide their own form of compost, and bacteria are necessary for plants to absorb nutrients; without their assistance, plan ts become weak and of inferior nutritional value (qtd. in Dean 25) . In 1963, French biochemist and farmer Andr\u00e9 Voisin wrote a book titled Grass Tetany. In it, he described a metabolic disease of goats and cattle caused by eating grass which was grown in magnesium - deficient soil. These animals developed irritability, spasms and tremors, and subsequently would stagger and drop to the ground in convulsions at sudden, loud noises or if frightene d or excited. Grass tetany due to magnesium deficiency as the proven cause had already been identified in the 1930s. It was observed that the low levels of magnesium found in these suffering animals could be corrected with injections of magnesium, which reversed these conditions. Voisin observed that intensive grazing practices and the overuse of mineral -deficient commercial fertilizers, which were common practices, were the culprits. Voisin i dentified that Holland was greatest user of commercial fertilizer on its pastures, and that Holland had the greatest incidence of grass tetany. Also, in the 1930s, potash (potassium) was the fert ilizer of choice, due to its low cost and Steele 9 easy uptake by plan ts; however, in an abundance of potassium, plants favor its absorption over magnesium and calcium, which are harder to absorb; this produces a crop which is magnesium - deficient (qtd. in Dean 25) . Erosion and run -off also are factors in mineral depletion of soil . In 1931, it was estimated that soil erosion was occurring at a rate of roughly one inch per year on cultivated land. (Bennett) A study published in 2006 found that t he U S is losing topsoil at a rate ten times that of the natural replenishment rate . (Powers) In acidic, light or sandy soils, magnesium itself is easily leached away . (Wikipedia.org ) Based on measurements of disso lved magnesium in the Mississippi River, the annual estimated loss of magnesium from Midwestern soils is 7.1 million kilogram s at least, and could be more if the magnesium in undissolved dirt carried in its currents were also included (Dean 26) . In addition to the loss of topsoil, magnesium depletion of the soil from acid rain occurs in three ways. First, magnesium leaching fr om the soil occurs in direct response to acid rain (Czapp) . Next, the abnormal soil acidity caused by acid rain (which contains nitric acid), actually changes soil chemistry, causing a reaction with calcium and magnesium to neut ralize the excess nitric aci d. Eventually, calcium and magnesium become depleted, leaving the nitric acid to react with aluminum oxide in the soil, which is then taken up into the plant and decreases its survival ability. Finally, once the soil is tested and found to be particularly acid, it is usually treated with calcium oxide, also known as lime. This is another practice which would cause further magnesium deficiency in plants (Dean 26) . One would consider that since this problem has been going on for a long time, magnesium replacement for our arable land would be a common practice today. However, during research for this paper, a scientific article w as found which touted magnesium soil Steele 10 replacement (Mikkelsen); an agricultural extension service article referred to magnesium replacement, but stated it was not needed in all soils: The application of dolomitic limestone is the most cost -effective method for applying the magne sium that is needed. The magnesium content of dolomitic limestone varies from 8 to10%. To be effective, this magnesium source should be broadcast an d incorporated before planting. There are fertilizers that are a combination of potassium sulfate and magnesium sulfate. The magnesium content is 11%. The sulfur concentration is 22% and the potassium oxide percentage is 22%. This fertilizer is easily used in a starter fertilizer for corn or as a magnesium source when there is no desire to inc rease soil pH. Although the need for the addition of magnesium to a fertilizer program is not widespread in Minnesota, this nutrient can increase crop production when needed. The potential for need should not be ignored. If there is doubt about the need, a nalyze the soil to be sure (Reh m et al.). When examining the magnesium versus potassium percentage content of the above recommended fertilizers, it is important to note that potassium is present in double the amount of magnesium; as has been previously not ed, plants will favor the absorption of potassium over magnesium in soil that contains an abundance of potassium. Since magnesium is the central ion in the chlorophyll molecule (Fiedor et al.), this does not potentially bode well for the crop. And this is true, as far as non-hybridized plants go. However, Katherine Czapp states in her article \"The Neglected Mineral We Ca nnot Live Without\": To add insult to injury, new plant hybrids are continually introduced that have been bred to survive on these mineral -depleted soils. Of course, when mineral - Steele 11 depleted crops are eaten by animals or by us, they will sooner or later cause disease. Even though organically raised crops should be a better bet nutritionally, this isn't always the case, and it pays in terms of you r health to learn how your farmer replenishes the minerals on his fields (Czapp) . Together, these factors cause magnesium deficiency in our whole foods supply. But, what if the mainstay of the diet is not one consisting of whole foods? Dietary Deficiencie s, Junk Food and Processed Food . Coincidentally, with industrialized farming practices and soil depletion , the daily magnesium dietary intake in the US has fallen from 500 mg/day at the turn of the twentieth century, to 175 -225 mg/day in 1994. The National Academy of Sciences has determined that most American men obtain about 80% of the Recommended Daily Allowance (RDA) for magnesium, and women average about 70% of the RDA ( qtd. in Dean xviii) . A 1988 US government study concluded that the standard American diet failed to provide the daily requirement of magnesium (Dean 23) . Is it any wonder, given our limited soil supply of magnesium, that this situation prevails? Magnesium experts say the current RDA is inadequate to prevent magnesium deficiency (Dean xvii i). According to Ross Pelton RPh, PhD, CCN, the author of Drug Induced Nutrition Depletion , RDAs represent \"the minimum wage of nutrition\" (qtd. by Onusic) . That the daily allowance of magnesium intake should be increased will become clear when taking into account diet and lifestyle factors in the sections which follow . We a nation filled with junk food junkies: on average, roughly 90% of our food dollar is spent on junk food. Junk food makes up a bout 27% of the American diet. Magnesium experts have determined that the typical American diet, rich in fat, sugar, salt, synthetic Vitamin D, phosphates, protein, and supplemented calcium is not only deficient in magnesium, but actually Steele 12 increases the need for ma gnesium in the body (De an 23) . Processed and synthetic foods and drinks with high sugar or alcohol content work to waste magnesium, as it is used to metabolize these foods and to detoxify the b ody as a result of their intake. The body requires at least 28 molecules of magnesium to metabolize a single molecule of glucose; fructose requires 56 molecules of magnesium \u2014an unsustainable amount loss (Dean xix) , Aspartame and monosodium glutamate (MSG) are often contained in junk fo ods; destroy nerve cells (neurotoxic , excitotoxic ) and being toxins, by magnesium (Dean 61) . Phosphates in carbonated drinks and processed meats bind with magnesium to form insoluble magnesium phosphate, which is unusable by the body (Czapp) . Processed f oods are not much better. Magnesium content is significantly reduced in the refining and processing of processed and fast foods. Nearly all of the magnesium contained in grains is lost during the milling process, when bran and germ are removed from the wh ole grain to make white flour. White flour is used nearly exclusively to make hundreds of devitalized processed food items. A good example: one slice of white bread contains 6 mg of magnesium, whereas one slice of whole wheat contains 24 mg magnesium . Whe n nuts and seeds are roasted, or their oils are extracted, magnesium is lost (Czapp) . Magnesium is also lost into the water as it leaches out of vegetables as they are boiled. It would be a good idea to use this water as a broth when making soup, to reclai m its magnesium content (Dean 28) . Foods tend to lose less calcium than magnesium through these processes; this adds to a problematic dietary calcium overload burden, and greater potential for calcification of cells and tissues (Czapp) . Diets: The Fad, The Good and The Blockers . Fad diets are still popular with people hoping to jump -start their weight loss process. Most notable among the se, and one of the top five fad diets of 2015 , is the Paleo diet. This diet is based upon the notion that as humans, it is beneficial from Steele 13 a weight loss standpoint to eat the foods which would have been available to the hunter -gatherer caveman (Dean xviii). Vegetables, fruits and meat protein are stressed, while grains, legumes and refined sugar are eliminated. The problem with this fad diet is in the avoidance of grains and the emphasis on protein. Homocysteine , an amino acid and a normal by -product of protein digestion, must be processed by the body. The major enzymes involved in homocysteine meta bolism are magnesium -dependent. When homocysteine is present at an elevated level, it causes the oxidation of cholesterol; this oxidated cholesterol damages blood vessels, as in the case of patients with hear t disease. Oxidative degradation of fats occurs whe n there is a lack of magnesium (Dean 92). If it is necessary to be on a high -protein diet, an additional 300 mg magnesium should be supplemented daily (Dean 34). Raw-foodi es and green -juicers are not immune, either. Dr. Dean reports having consulted with people drinking more than 100 ounces of organic green juice per day, who still have symptoms such as heart palpitations and leg cramps. Even in the case of high -quality produ ce, magnesium and other nutrients can be depleted or lost after harvesting, through handling, refrigeration, storage and transport, even if done properly. Further storage of produce in one's own refrigerator continues this loss of nutrients, no matter thei r original source. And of course, unless the soil itself is replenished with minerals, even organic food will be mineral -deficient before it leaves the farm (Dean xix) . In addition, there are certain foods which contain chemicals which block the ac tion o f magnesium. For instance, tannins in some teas bind and rem ove all minerals from the body. Both oxalic acid (found in chard and spinach, cabbage, broccoli and brussels sprouts ) and phytic acid (from hulls of seed and grain brans) block magnesium and other minerals by forming an insoluble compound with them. This causes minerals to be eli minated, rather than absorbed. Steele 14 Oxalic acid is removed by cooking, so these vegetables should be steamed instead of eaten raw or juiced. Phytic acid can be removed by soaking grains and seeds for eight to twelve hours. In the case of soybeans, cooking does not destroy or eliminate phytic acid; only fermentation will reduce phytic acid, as i n the case of miso and tempeh. Therefore, soy powde r, soy milk, and tofu should be eaten in limited quantity only (Dean 34) . Given this information, it is apparent that it is extremely difficult to obtain even the current RDA intake of magnesium by way of diet alone; this indicates that in addition to eat ing a high -quality diet, supplementation of magnesium is an absolute must. Fluoridation . \"Fluoridation of tap water is a disaster that threatens to afflict the population with an epidemic of arthritis and, by r ecent reports, cancer as well\" (Dean 29) . The proportion of imminent disaster is well understood, when one considers that as of 2003, roughly 60% of US cities were engaging in this form of mass medication of the populace, despite research findings by the Journal of Dental Research that the practice of water fluoridation is unrelated to a decrease in tooth decay rates. Chronic fluoride use has been linked to multiple health problems such as osteoporosis, arthritis, osteomalacia, and Alzheimer's disease. Five studies since 1990 show that the incidence of fractured hip in both older men and women are as much as 87% higher in areas with fluoridated water versus those in non-fluoridated areas. Fluoride is also found in toothpaste and in selective serotonin inhibitor \u2014the second -most prescribed class of drugs. The problem with fluoride is that it seeks out minerals such as magnesium and binds with them, creating a compound which has no bioavailability to the body. For example, magnesium fluoride, also known as sellaite, is an almost insoluble mineral compound which takes the place of magnesium in hard tissues, such as bone and cartilage; its brittleness makes bone susceptible to fractu re. Steele 15 (Dean 29) In addition, the flu oride salts most commonly used to fluoridate water supplies are hydrofluosilicic acid and sodium silicofluorides, which are waste products created by the phosphate fertilizer industry. In addition to binding any available magnesium in the body, the presenc e of fluoride increases the toxic load on the human body (Balch 137) . As will be presented , since magnesium also plays a ro le in detoxification, increased magnesium intake is required to counteract the effects of these toxins as well. Dehydration and Magn esium : A Symbiotic Relationship . The human body is composed of roughly 60 to 70% water; therefore, the importance of maintaining a state of adequate hydration with quality water cannot be stressed enough. However, in addition to water, magnesium has a role in the maintenance of the regulation of the body' s temperature (Jensen 228 , livestrong.com ). Heavy sweating from endurance sports such as marathon running or strenuous exercise workouts can dangerously deplete magnesium stores and other electrolytes (except calcium), resulting in trembling, faintness and even seizures and death. The drenching sweats that some menopausal women suffer cause magnesium loss as well, and their diminishing magnesium levels worsen their jagged nerves, sleep disturbances, pani c attacks, body aches and depression. (livestrong.com) Therefore, magnesium replacement for dehydration is a must. Since water follows minerals into the cell (DrCaronlynDean.com), and it is clear that water loss precipitates magnesium loss, which is then r esponsible for cooling the body, there is a clear indication that both hydration status and magnesium levels must be maintained adequately for good health, as each has a symbiotic effect on the other. The Recent Emphasis on Calcium . In the 1970s, it was noted that there could be a connection between hip fra ctures in post -menopausal women and their calcium intake. Since that time, it has been a common practice for doctors to promote that their older female patients include calcium Steele 16 supplementation as part o f their medication regimen (Murray) . The emphasis on calcium has diverted our attention from any other mineral. It seems that the ten dency is to always look for the 'most important' or the 'star' and abandon teamwork. Due to its abundance in the body, calc ium became the star. And, there has been magnesium research accumulated but not adequately publicized or discussed (Dean 22). However, more recent available information indicates that the allopathic medical community may be getting wise to the overwhelmin g evidence that excess calcium, or calcium toxicity, is creating problems in the human body \u2014most notably, in the area of cardiovascular health (Pray) . The average American diet is too high in calcium, and there seems to be a general lack of awareness of the necessity for balance between calcium and magnesium: Both calcium and magnesium are necessary for the healthy body \u2014in proper balance to one another, as well as to other necessary minerals. Considered biochemical antagonist s, one cannot act without eliciting the opposite reaction of the other. Yet calcium and magnesium must both be present in balanced amounts for either one to function normally in the body. Some researchers suggest that the healthy ratio of calcium to magnes ium in the diet should be 2:1. Others consider 1:1 to reflect ratios that we evolved with based on our diet prior to the advent of agriculture. In modern industrialized countries the ratio from diet is from 5:1 to as much as 15:1. The imbalance of these tw o very important minerals produces many dire consequences in the body that are often overlooked by medical practitioners when treating the disease states they cause (Dean 21) . The connection is a simple one, when considering the antagonist effect that calc ium has on magnesium levels, and that a magnesium -deficient state makes it impossible for calcium to Steele 17 remain in solution, thereby causing the calcification of tissues. During the research of this paper, few sources were found in the arena of allopathic medi cine, indicating that magnesium deficiency could be a cofactor in the calcification process, and an article written in 2013 , entitled 'Magnesium and Osteoporosis: Current State of Knowledge and Future Research Directions ' reporte d that: Although the eviden ce is still fragmentary, most of the experimental and clinical data available in the literature point to magnesium as a contributor factor to bone health. Consequently, optimizing magnesium intake might represent an effective and low -cost preventive measur e against osteoporosis in individuals with documented magnesium deficiency, while doubts remain about supplementing the general population with the mineral since too much magnesium seems to have detrimental effects on the bone. (Castiglioni et al.) Due to the presence of many other documented findings regarding the essential role of magnesium in the human body, i t is apparent that the modern medical community should continue to pursue conscientious research pertaining to the benefits of magnesium. However, given the widespread use of highly -engineered pharmaceuticals in this country, it is possible that this type of research is not a top -priority goal. Pharmaceutical Feeding Frenzy . The overwhelming use of prescription pharmaceuticals in the US is a well -known fact. When a doctor or patient fails to recognize an illness as one of many which have a direct and confirmed connection to magnesium deficiency and are treatable with magnesium (Czapp) , the patient often ends up being treated with prescription drugs. Painkillers, diuretics, antibiotics, cortisone and other drugs further deplete magnesium and other mine rals. The Mayo Clinic announced the results of a study in 2013, reporting that roughly 70% of Steele 18 Americans take prescription drugs. In actuality, 79% were taking one prescription drug, 50% were taking two, and 20% were taking more than five prescription drugs . It went on further to report that \u00bc of women age 50 -64 are on an antidepressant drug. The Mayo Clinic reported that antibiotics are the most prescribed drug, and antidepressants are the second -most prescribed drugs ( Sparks ). Opiates are the third most pr escribed drugs, and statins come in at fourth place. Expenditures on prescription drugs reached $250 billion in 2009, and accounted for 12 percent of total personal health care expenditures. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the percentage of people using at least one prescription drug in the past month increased nearly fifty percent between 2007 and 2010. The researchers further predict that there is no end in sight, and that prescription drug spending will only increase in the f uture (Dean xxvii) . Perhaps, there is a reason for this. Pharmaceuticals is an industry which generates a higher profit margin than any other industry and is accustomed to multi -billion dollar malpractice fines. The pharmaceuticals industry has created every life -saving drug on the market, and has profited greatly for their efforts, which have not always been honest ones. In 2013, Pfizer made a profit margin of 47%, and a to tal of five companies made a profit of 20% or more. With the cost of a full course of some drugs at $100,000 or more, and production cost at only a small fraction of this, pharmaceutical companies are under some scrutiny for potential profiteering. They co unter with pointing out that only about three out of every ten drugs developed actually ends up going on the market, and the research and development costs for all of these drugs must be recouped. However, the well -known accounting formula of TOTAL INCOME - TOTAL EXPENSE = PROFIT MARGIN already takes research and development costs into account , because they are included in the total expense of operating a company . Also, Steele 19 drug companies fight to hold on to exclusive patent rights, often hiring \"floors -full of lawyers \" to parlay for even an additional one -month patent extension, which could mean big money to the drug company (Anderson). Kick -backs, expensive gifts, and the like have been the historic practice in the relationship of the pharmaceutical sales repr esentative and the doctor ; as scrutiny increases, limits have been placed on these practices. As of 2014, t he Council of Europe was reported to be launching an investigation into \"protecting patients and public health against the undue influence of the pharmaceutical industry\" (Anderson) . Unscrupulous practices are common in this industry, indicating how keen drug companies are to keep their hold on their market share. Table 1 on page 2 0 takes a look at the ten largest pharmaceutical co rporations in the world in 2014. Incredibly, the sky is the limit for Big Pharma, a term which has even entered the pages of the Cambridge dictionary. However, it does not make sense for us to continue along this track, given the way that the population is already p aying these high premiums with their lives. Adverse drug reactions account for more than 100,000 deaths and 1.5 million hospitalizations per year. An additional 750,000 persons develop drug reactions after they are hospitalized. Thirty percent of all emergency room visits are drug -related (Czapp) . Although pharmaceuticals may do a great deal of good in acute instances, to widely and exclusively promote their use in all situations over more natural means is an irresponsible approach, and a wholesale sel lout of the general populace in the name of profit.

It agreed to pay a $3 billion settlement when it was convicted on a number of charges including promotion of drugs for unapproved uses, failure to report safety data about the diabetes drug Ava ndia, reporting false prices to Medicaid, and kickbacks to physicians. It was the largest health -care fraud case in American history and the largest settlement by a drug company. Steele 21 To get a better window into exactly how pharmaceuticals work and react in the human body, it would be beneficial to examine the exp erience of one of the foremost magnesium experts, Mildred Selig , MD, who began her research career in the 1960s working for drug companies. There, she first noticed that many of the drugs' side effects were actually magnesium deficiency symptoms. It seemed apparent to Dr. Selig that many drugs seemed to cause a greater demand for and utilization of magnesium: for example, by acidifying the body, which then uses magnesium in order to neutralize the acid and to detoxify itself . Other drugs seemed to deplete magnesium from the body altogether, or else they pulled magnesium from storage sites and increased magnesium serum levels. The most common drugs in use today ca n create magnesium deficiencies (Dean 36): diuretics (for high blood pressure) bronchodilators, such as theophylline (for asthma) birth control pills insulin antidepressants Digitalis (digoxin; for fast heartbeat) tetracycline and certain other antibiotics corticosteroids (for asthma, COPD) cocaine nicotine The interaction between pharmaceutical drugs and magnesium levels of the body does not end here. Muscle relaxant medications, barbiturates, hypnotics and narcotics may be enhanced by an adequate magnesium level, or by magnesium supplementation \u2014less drug may be needed to achieve the same result . Many antibiotics cause magnesium loss \u2014it may be necessary to stagger the doses of any magnesium supplement versus the antibiotic schedule. Diuretics act to lower the blood pressure by cau sing increased kidney filtration . This action throws off potassium and magnesium in the urine. Cardiac drugs, such as cardiac gly cosides and digoxin, Steele 22 also decrease magnesium levels , and require supplementation. Magnesium inhibits iron absorption, as well as the antibiotics tetracycline, ciprofloxacin, and vancomycin \u2014magnesium supplementation should be staggered around these doses (Dean 37) . Aside from altered elimination of magnesium and its effect on pharmaceutical drugs, a more serious interaction can occur: that of drug -nutrient reaction. This reaction may change the effect of a drug, which could lead to malnutrition, provoke a state of al tered metabolism, or cause a nutrient imbalance. For instance, a clas sic and well -known interaction is the interaction between grapefruit juice and simvastatin \u2014grapefruit juice increases bioavailability of this drug, toxic ( Bollate qtd. in Onuses ). There are more examples of drug -nutrient reactions. A ntiepileptic drugs adversely affect vitamin D and K; they affect folate metabolism, biotin status, c arnitine status and bone health, and they can cause liver toxicity. Antipsychotic drugs are associated with weight gain, hyperglycemia and elevated lipids ( Bollate may also cause nutrient depletions by altering the appetite, interfering with taste or smell, inducing nausea , vomiting or diarrhea , causing dry or infla med oral mucosa , changing the acidity of the digestive tract, damaging the cells, binding to nutrients, or competing for enzyme systems or transporters (Rolfes qtd. in Onusi c). Most commonly, drugs affect the cytochrome P450 pathway, a metabolic pathway which is basically a system within the liver through which drugs and other toxins travel in order for the body to make them more water - soluble for elimination (Onusic , anaesthetist.com ). Also, drugs themselves or their delivery systems (capsule, coatings, etc.) can cause problems in the body. For instance, the coating on enteric coated aspirin contains 50 mg of aluminum, which has been implicated in the development of senility and dementia (Onusic) . Acid -reducing proton pump inhibitor medications (Prilosec, Protonix and others) ha ve been known to cause brittle bones, and a Steele 23 decrease in intrinsic factor in the small intestine; decreased intrinsic factor leads to decreases in vitamin B 12 absorption, and low vitamin B 12 levels r esults in poor DNA replication (Onusic) , a condition that can perpetuate cancer. This illustrates that pharmaceuticals, liberally and extensively given to cure, control or alleviate a problem, often end up causing further problems in the human body due to their side effects and the alterations to human metabolism which they create. In essence, all of the symptoms \"treated \" by these drugs eventually become worse (Czapp) . Drug companies guard their market share with zeal, and sometimes, thr ough blatant criminal behavior. T his leads to the conclusion that due to the potential financial gain at stake, the pharmaceutical industry would like to maintain their exclusive status and will protect this status through various means, also including indoctrination of the public through advertising. Drug interactions with one another have not been investigated in this paper ; they themselves are still being discovered by the medical community, and this discussion should suffice in achieving its goal of examining the role which pharmaceuticals play in maintaining our transient health and our long -term illness. Pharmaceuticals can at best be viewed as nothing more than a temporary patch. One cannot help but think that there must be a better , more integrous alternative . That better alternative is availabl e, by the name: Magnesium. Before an examination can be made of the benefits of magnesium, a few more reasons for how its deficiency occurs and the manner in which deficiency contributes to disease must be investigated. Stress . Stress is so common in our daily life that we have become desensitized to it and the message it is trying to give us, which is to slow down ( Dean 49) . A 2011 study by released in January of 2012 by the American Psychological Association, entitled \"Stress in America: Our Heal th At Risk\" states that more than half of Americans reported personal health problems (53 Steele 24 percent) as a source of stress, up from 2009 (47 percent), and that more than half (56 percent) of adults say they are doing an excellent or very good job of knowing when they are feeling stressed, but only about half as many (26 percent) report doing a n excellent or very good job at preventing themselves from becoming stressed (apa.org ) These figures show that at least half of us are ill due to stress, and only about one -quarter of us know how to deal effectively with it. This is of great concern with regard to magnesium. Anxiety in and of itself is not a bad thing \u2014it is, in fact, a mechanism for adaptation to stress. It is a chemical reaction which is created when the adrenal glands respond to a stressful event, such as low blood sugar, by releasing adrenaline. Adrenaline is very useful when trying to escape from a dangerous situation, because it stimulates fight -or-flight response of the sympathetic nervous system: the heart pumps faster, digestion slows and energy stores are released from liver and made availab le to heart, lungs and muscles (Dean 49) . However, m ental and physical stress, with its related continuous flow of adrenalin e, use up magnesium rapidly. Adrenaline increases heart rate, blood pressure, vascular constr iction and muscle contraction. All of these actions demand a steady supply of magnesium for smooth function. The nervous system also depends upon sufficient magnesium levels, due to its action as a natural relaxer and calcium channel blocker. Magnesium is important to the healthy functioning of the parasympathetic nervous system, which induces a state of calm. We are actually designed to operate, for the most part, in a calm, relaxed parasympathetic state; we are not designed to be in a chronic state of heart -pounding, stress - and adrenaline -driven sympathetic dominant fight -or-flight readiness . This constant state of stress for many of us, leads to chronic stress, irritability, anxiety, fatigue, insomnia along with concomitant magnesium loss, and ultimately, adrenal exhaustion, hypertension, heart disease and other conditions which would be considered by some to be worthy of pharmaceutical intervention. Magnesi um operates as a Steele 25 natural calcium cha nnel blocker to aid relaxation (Czapp) . However, given the state of fast -paced society today, it is not surprising that magnesium deficiency due to continual levels of stress is a pervasive condition. Digestive Problems, Absorption Difficulties, and Gut Dysbiosis . Inadequate production of stomach acid is one of the first problem s in digestion. Stomach acid is required for chemically changing minerals into an absorbable form through ionization. Elderly persons, as well as those with arthritis, asthma, depression, diabetes, gallbladder disease, osteoporosis, or gum disease often ten d to be deficient in hydrochlor ic acid. To make matters worse, if magnesium is deficient to begin with, gastric acid production is diminished, which hinders magnesium absorption even more: and all of these conditions are also associated with magnesium def iciency. Compounding the problem is that America has an addiction to antacids, because of our intake of sugary junk food and greasy fast foods which ferment in the stomach and cause a backflow of pancreatic enzymes from the small intestine (Dean 30) . In ad dition, if calcium carbonate antacids are used, they act on cue as the magnesium antagonists they are, and cause more magnesium to be excreted. At this point, calcium will not be able to stay in solution due to inadequate supply of magnesium, it cannot be absorbed properly and is deposited into soft tissues. The result is constipation due to interference with bowel muscle contractions, kidney stones due to the precipitation of calcium, and bladder irritability due to bladder wall calcification , to name a fe w (Czapp ). Then, there is the problem of yeast overgrowth. Candida albicans , also known as yeast, is a fungus which typically lives unnoticed in the large intestine. When it moves into the small intestine, it projects threadlike structures which punch tin y holes into the lining of the gut \u2014this condition is called leaky gut. This creates difficulty with the absorption of nutrients, and sets up Steele 26 and environment where toxins are readily absorbed into the body (Dean 33) . Excessive proliferation of yeast in the small intestine is a powerful trigger of inflammation throughout the body. Yeast produces 178 chemical antigens which are molecules capable of causing the immune system to produce an immune response in its normal life cycle. These antigens are absorbed into the bloodstream and start a never -ending inflammatory cascade to occur. Also, the body becomes more susceptible to the absorption of toxins by the gut. Acetaldehyde is a toxin which affects the brain, liver, and kidneys, and depletes B v itamins. It can also block hormone receptors affecting the thyroid, adrenals, and pituitary. For example, symptoms of thyroid imbalance are very common today, partly because thyroid hormones which appear at normal levels in the bloodstream cannot get insi de cells to do their work as a result of chronic acetaldehyde poisoning. There are several additional ways humans can be exposed to acetaldehyde \u2014through alcohol consumption, cigarette smoking, exhaust, and intake of high -fructose corn syrup. Acetaldehyde i s a powerful toxic by -product of yeast, and magnesiu m is needed to break it down. Without enough magnesium, acetaldehyde creates many side effects. Ironically, yeast overgrowth from the large intestine into the small intestine occurs under the influence of antibiotics, cortisone and other steroids, birth control pills, estrogen, and a high -sugar diet. These disrupt the normal beneficial bacterial flora, or microbiome, of the gut, which serve to protect against this type of invader , a condition known as gut dysbiosis. Yeast toxins, inflammatory products the body creates to neutralize them , and undigested food molecules all form barriers to the absorption of dietary and supplemental nutrients, including magnesium (Dean xxviii) . Similarly, Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) causes severe difficulty with absorption of nutrients. In order for magnesium levels to be optimized, correct stomach acidity, yeast overgrowth, food Steele 27 allergies, IBS and other absorption conditions must be addresse d in order to achieve max imum absorption of this mineral (Czapp) . Overwhelmed by Environmental Poisons: Metals , Pesticides, and Pollutants . Magnesium is utilized by the body for all sorts of detoxification pathways and is necessary for the neutralization of toxins, overly acidic conditions that arise in the body, and fo r protection from heavy metals. It plays a vital role in protecting us from the onslaught of man -made chemicals all around us. Glutathione, an antioxidant normally produced by the body and a detoxifier of mercury, lead and arsenic among others, requires magnesium for its synthesis (Czapp) . In addition, magnesium itself binds with and helps to eliminate heavy metals (Dean 180) . In our toxic environment today, magnesium has plenty of detoxifica tion work to perform. Dr. Dean neatly describes the enormous problem we are faced with: In an important environmental study, toxic chemicals were found in nearly all foods tested by the FDA at levels consistent with negative health effects. They included p ersistent organic pollutants such as DDT and dioxin, which have been banned in the United States for decades but are still produced in other countries. Exposure to minuscule levels of these chemicals at crucial times in fetal and infant development can dis rupt or damage human hormone, reproductive, neurological, and immune systems . ...In 1985, the US Environmental Protection Agency published a survey of human fat composition. It found that more than 99 percent of the population has measurable levels of the ni ne chemicals they tested for, including PCBs and DDT. In 2000, 100 percent of fat samples tested were positive for chemicals . ...In 2000 the CDC released the very first large -scale national survey of environmental toxins from human samples, and the results are Steele 28 startling. Blood and urine levels of twenty -seven chemicals tested in 5,000 Americans far exceeded safe levels. The EPA and CDC mostly rely on air, water, and soil samples to test for toxic levels of chemicals. Even then, only a few dozen of the more t han 100,000 chemicals in everyday use are monitored for safety. Hopefully this human study will reinforce a cutback in chemical pesticide use, as pledged by the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) and the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in 1993. Chemical pesticide use, however, has increased from 900 million pounds in 1992 to 940 million pounds in 2000, while total cropland has decreased. And the riskiest chemical pesticides, such as organophosphates and carbamates, probab le or possible carcinogens, still account for over 40 percent of the pesticides used in U.S. agriculture \" (qtd. in Dean 18 3- 184). Since magnesium is used in the binding and elimination o f heavy metal toxins especially, it is blazing ly apparent that the human body, taxed like never before with poisonous substances in the environment , dental treatments , food supply and others , has assumed a state of perpetual magnesium deficiency due to this travesty alone. Magnesium Wasting . There are conditions in which magnesium is easily wasted from the kidneys, but in general this is a rare genetic defect. Although costly and inconvenient, these are usually treated in conventional medicine with intravenous magnesium (Dean 38) . However , there is another phenomenon where magnesium deficiency itself seems to cause a condition which promotes magnesium wasting: Magnesium -deficiency studies on the kidneys have shown intraluminal calcare ous deposition in the corticomedullary area and damage to the tubule epithelium. Steele 29 Damage to the kidneys from magnesium deficiency creates a situation that intensifies magnesium deficits. Micropuncture studies have shown that most active renal tubular reabs orption of magnesium occurs at sites that are potentially damaged by magnesium deficiencies, meaning these conditions can cause renal tubular magnesium wasting. Both hyperparathyroidism and hypervitaminosis D increase blood and thus urinary loads of calciu m and thus cause even further magnesium loss. Most renal reabsorption of magnesium occurs in the proximal tubule and the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle. In hypomagnesemic patients, the kidney may excrete as little as 1 mEq/L of magnesium. Magnes ium will be removed from bone stores in times of deficiency. Primary renal disorders cause hypomagnesemia by decreased tubular reabsorption of mag nesium by the damaged kidneys. This condition occurs in the diuretic phase of acute tubular necrosis, post -obstructive diuresis, and renal tubular acidosis. (Sircus 19) It is clear to see that adequate magnesium levels must be maintained in the body, to prevent this particular magnesium -wasting condition caused by damage to the kidney. Now that several of the main contributors to magnesium deficiency have been identified, it is important to translate this information into a language which can help us truly understand the devastating effect that low magnesium levels have on the human body , and exactly how wide - ranging the problem truly is . CONDITIONS CAUSED BY MAGNESIUM DEFICIENCY Anxiety/ Depression . According to 2005 statistics, roughly forty million Americans, or 18% of the population age 18 and over, su ffer from some form of anxiety (aada.org) . In addition, in 2015, an estimated 16.1 million adults aged 18 or older in the US had at least one major Steele 30 depressive episode in the past year. This number represented 6.7% of all U.S. adults (nimh.nih.gov) . According to Peter Wehrwein, contributor at Harva rd Health Publications : The National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS), the rate of antidepressant use in this country among teens and adults (people ages 12 and older) increased by almost 400% between 1988 -1994 and 2005 -2008. The federal government's health statisticians figure that about one in every 10 Americans takes an antidepressant. And by their reckoning, antidepressants were the third most common prescription medication taken by Americans in 2005 -2008, the latest period during which the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) collected data on prescription drug use \" (Harvard.edu ). Other statistics quoted by Wehrwein denote that 23% of women in the 40s to 50s age grou p take antidepressants, a higher percentage than any other group; women are 2 \u00bd times more likely to be taking an antidepressant than men. Antidepressant use does not appear to vary by income status (Harvard.edu ). The statistics show an outstanding prevale nce of anxiety and depression in our country. Even children a re susceptible to depression and anxiety and are being medicated for these conditions. The fact that prescription antianxiety agents and antidepressants are being used at an unprecedented rate only contributes to magnesium deficiency, in that it has been observed that prescription drugs increase the demand for magnesium in the body. The phar maceutical industry has focused its research of depression on SSRIs in order to capitalize on the effects of serotonin, the 'feel -good ' chemical . SSRIs artificially flood the body with serotonin by preventing its breakdown and elimination, theoretically to cause mood elevation. What the body really needs, however, is magnesium. Patients have different reactions to SSRIs: some are relieved of depression, some become anxious and irritable, and still others feel relief enough Steele 31 from apathy to be able to act on s uicidal or homicidal thoughts. Still other patients experience flattened moods, where they can neither laugh nor cry; this keeps them from depression, but they are doomed to an emotionless life (Dean 56). Depression is related to stress and anxiety , and also to magnesium deficiency. During the stress reaction, adrenaline levels increase, which wastes magnesium. In fact, magnesium depletion itself stresses the body, which results in panic attacks, which yields more stress (Dean 50). During experiments in wh ich adrenaline was given intravenously, a decrease in magnesium, calcium, potassium and sodium occurred. When the IV adrenaline was stopped, the body recovers in thirty minutes; however, magnesium takes much longer to reach normal levels (Dean 47). Seroton in, the \"feel good\" hormone, requires magnesium in its delicate balance of release and reception by cells in the brain. Only when adequate magnesium levels are present in the body can mental and emotional equilibrium be experienced (Czapp) . A study by Dr. R.H. Cox and Dr. C.N. Shealy revealed that out of 500 depressed study participants, the majority were found to be magnesium deficient (Cox et. al qtd. in Dean 46 ). Other clinical trials have proven out that magnesium deficiency can be an underlying cause o f anxiety and depression (Dean 48) . Migraines . As defined by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) , a migraine is a type of headache. It may occur with symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, or sensitivity to light and sound. In many people, a throbbing pain is felt only on one side of the head (medlineplus.gov) . Twenty -five million Americans suffer from migraines, statistically women more than men especially in the 25 to 50 year age group (Dean 63) . Some of the clearly identified triggers or factors tha t cause these headaches include: allergies and allergic reactions; bright lights, loud noises, and certain odors or perfumes; physical or emotional stress; changes in sleep patterns; smoking or exposure to smoke; skipping meals or fasting; and alcoho l. (Sircu s 275) . In addition Steele 32 to these, the NIH also includes the following known triggers for migraine: caffeine withdrawal; changes in hormone levels during a woman's menstrual cycle or with the use of birth control pills; exercise or other physical stress ; stres s and anxiety; chocolate; dairy foods, especially certain cheeses; foods containing monosodium glutamate (MSG); foods with tyr amine, which include red wine, aged cheese, smoked fish, chicken livers, figs, and certain beans; fruits (avocado, banana, citrus) ; meats containing nitrates (bacon, hot dogs, other cured meats); onions; peanuts and other nuts and seeds; and p rocessed, fermented, pickled, or marinated foods . (medlineplus.gov) Table 2 shows the possible relationship between these triggers and magnesium deficiency, as taken from th is information . Steele 33 Table 2: Migraine Triggers and Their Possible Relationship to Low Magnesium Status MIGRAINE TRIGGER RELATIONSHIP TO LOW MG++ Allergies and allergic reactions Antigen production Bright lights Adrenaline, stress Loud noises Adrenaline, stress Certain odors or perfumes Environmental toxin/sensitivity Physical or emotional stress Adrenaline, stress Changes in sleep patterns Adrenaline, stress Smoking or exposure to smoke Environmental toxins Skipping meals or fasting Adrenaline, blood sugar, elimination of toxins during healing crisis Chocolate Antigen production Alcohol Elimination of magnesium, dehydration, toxin, alters blood sugar Dairy foods, especially certain cheeses Allergy/antigen production, possible environmental toxins, tyramine (toxin) Foods with monosodium glutamate (MSG) Excitotoxin Foods with tyramine, which includes red wine, aged cheese, smoked fish, chicken livers, figs, and certain beans Toxins, tyramine (toxin) , excitotoxins Fruits (avocado, banana, citrus fruit) Antigen production Meats containing nitrates (bacon, hot dogs, salami, cured meats) Toxins , excitotoxins Onions (rare) Antigen production Peanuts and other nuts and seeds Antigen production, excitotoxins Processed, fermented, picked, or marinated foods Toxins, tyramine, e xcitotoxins From this table and the information that has been presented , it is easily extrapolated that the underlying mechanisms behind each migraine trigger are those which have been identified as inherently requiring detoxification, neutralization, or some other mediation by magnesium, and that deficient magnesium levels w ould preclude these process es. Also, it should be noted at aspartame is missing from this list, and should be considered an excitotoxin , which can cause migraine in the absence of adequate magnesium (Dean 61 -62). Conditions common to females which trigge r migraines are also associated with magnesium deficiency, including pregnancy and menstruation. In non -menopausal women, Steele 34 estrogen rises before the period, causing a shift of blood magnesium into bones and muscles; as a result, magnesium levels in the brai n are lowered (Dean 64, 133) . In addition to this symptom -based evidence which has long been known , research studies have been performed which have borne out the magnesium connection in the evolution of migraines: Dr. Alexander Mauskop, director of the New York Headache Center, working with Drs. Bella and Burton Altura, administered 200 mg of magnesium daily to a group of 3000 patients; there was an 80% reduction in their migraine symptoms. This study did not have a control group, so results could be questi oned, but it aroused a great deal of excitement and triggered a flurry further research on migraines and magnesium (Dean 64) . Subsequent studies of migraine patients confirmed a common pattern and support role for magnesium deficiency in the development of headaches. The researchers found that infusion of magnesium resulted in a rapid and sust ained relief of acute migraine. Because of an excellent safety profile and low cost, they recommend oral magnesium supplementation for migraine sufferers at a level of 6mg/kg/day (Dean 65) . Another research team treated 81 patients who suffered ongoing migraine headaches with 300 mg of magnesium twice a day. The frequency of migraines was reduced by 41.6 percent in the magnesium group but by only 15.8 percent in a con trol group that received placebos. The number of migraine days and drug consumption for pain also decreased significantly in Steele 35 the magnesium group. High -dose oral magnesium appears to be effective in migraine treatment and prevention (Dean 66) . Besides aidin g in the detoxification of antigens and toxins, the mechanism for the help that magnesium provides for the migraine sufferer are manifold. Magnesium prevents platelet aggregation, acting as a blood thinner, which prevents tiny vessels from blockage and ves sel spasm which impede blood flow. It modulates hyperactive brain neurotransmitters and regulates the inflammatory process, which both play a role in migraines when they are imbalanced. Finally, magnesium relaxes head and neck muscles, thus preventing lac tic acid buildup which, along with tense muscles, can worsen head pain. It should be briefly mentioned that the condition of low blood sugar, or hypoglycemia, is an aggravating factor in migraine (Dean 61); it will be examined in the next section on Metabo lic Syndrome X and Type 2 Diabetes. Without a doubt, magnesium should be the drug of choice when it comes to treating migraine headache, and the allergies which are implicated as triggers, as it can unquestionably be considered a deficiency syndrome. Metab olic Syndrome X and Type 2 Diabetes . Metabolic Syndrome X, or Metabolic Syndrome, is a group of five risk factors for the development of heart disease, diabetes, and stroke. The five risk factors include: increase blood pressure (greater than 130/85), high blood sugar levels (insulin resistance), excess fat around the waist, high triglyceride levels, and low levels of good cholesterol, or HDL. If a person has one of these risk factors, it does not mean tha t they hav e developed metabolic syndrome. However, having one of these risk factors will increase the chances of developing cardiovascular diseases. Having three or more of these factors will result in a diagnosis of metabolic syndrome and will further inc rease the risk of health complications. The American Heart Association ( AHA ) reports that as of 2014, 35 percent of adults currently Steele 36 have this condition in the US (Burke ). Type 2 Diabetes is a condition characterized by high blood glucose levels caused by either a lack of insulin or the body's inability to use ins ulin efficiently. Type 2 diabetes develops most often in middle -aged and older adults but can appear in children, teens, and young people. It is estimated that 29 million people, or approximately 9.3 percent of the U.S. population, have Type 2 diabetes: 21 million who have been diagnosed with it, and 8.1 million who are as yet undiagnosed (cdc.gov) . Metabolic Syndrome X plays an important role when examining both Type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular health and illness, because it is considered to be a precursor to both. The greater connection, however, will be better understood when examining the dance that occurs between magnesium and insulin. Insulin is a natural endocrine hormon e which is produced by the beta cells in the islets of Langerhans in the pancreas. Insulin allows cells to utilize glucose for energy; in fact, cells cannot utilize glucose without insulin. Insulin also causes glucose to be stored as glycogen in the liver and as fat , thereby regulating the level of glucose in the bloodstream. In Type 1 diabetes, the beta cells fail to make enough insulin. In contrast, in Type 2 diabetes, the beta cells are producing insulin, but cells throughout the body are not responding normally to the insulin. This is phenomenon is termed insulin resistance (medicine t.com) . Aside from these very vital functions, it is not appreciated that insulin serves various other functions in regulating each of the following (Sircus 13) : Lifespan \u2014lower insulin levels equate to a longer life Blood sugar Blood lipids Excess nutrients (from glucose, carb ohydrates and calories) are converted to fat Muscle building Steele 37 Protein storage Magnesium levels Calcium levels Retains sodium levels Cell division Liver functions Sex hormones, estrogen, progesterone, testosterone Cholesterol in the body As amazing as this process is, there is another actor in the wings of the insulin stage: magnesium. However, as in its relationship with calcium, magnesium works closely with insulin in a myriad of ways. Magnesium and insulin need each other very much . Magnesium is necessary for both the action of insulin and its manufacture . Without magnesium , the pancreas won't secrete enough insulin \u2014or the insulin it secretes won't be efficient enough \u2014to control blood sugar. In fact, Type 2 diabetes is associated with magnesium depletion. A growing body of evidence suggests that magnesium plays an important role in reducing cardiovascular risk, and may be directly involved in the develo pment of Type 2 diabetes itself. Low serum and intracellular magnesium concentrations are associated with insulin resistance, impaired glucose tolerance, a nd decreased insulin secretion. Without insulin, though, magnesium is not transported from blood into cells where it is most needed. Dr. Mark Sircus notes that Dr. Jerry Nadler and colleagues put 16 healthy people on magnesium -deficient diets and noted that their insulin became less effective at moving sugar from their blood into cells to be burned or stored as fuel. In other words, they became insulin resistant. Insulin resistance and magnesium depletion result in a vicious cycle of worsening insulin resistance and decrease in intracellular magnesium, which Steele 38 limits the role of magnesium in vi tal cellular processes. If cells become resistant to insulin, or if insufficient amounts of insulin are produced , then little magnesium enters the cell where it is needed. When insulin processing becomes problematic, magnesium is excreted via the urine ; this process is called magnesium wasting disease (Sircus 10 -14). Magnesium is also an important cofactor for enzymes involved in carbohydrate metabolism ; its depletion threatens overall metabolism. Magnesium also helps correct abnormal lipoprotein patterns. Magnesium replacement improves insulin sensitivity, which in turn can markedly reduce triglyceride levels. Reduced triglyceride availability, in turn, reduces very -low-density - lipoproteins (VLDL) and low -density lipoprotein s (LDL), both of which have been implicated in cardiovascular disease. Magnesium supplementation can also raise levels of beneficial high - density lipoprotein s (HDL) ( Sircus 13). When m agnesium levels fall, hype rsecretion of adrenalin e and insulin compensate . Their increased secretions help maintain the constancy of the levels of intracellular magnesium in the soft tissues. Plasma and in tracellular magnesium concentrations are tightly regulated by insulin. According to Dr. Ron Rosedale, \"Extra insulin floati ng around in the blood causes plaque build - up. They didn't know why, but we know that insulin causes endothelial proliferation. Every step of the way, insulin is causing cardiovascular disease. It fills the body with plaque, it constricts the arteries, it stimulates the sympathetic nervous system, and it increases platelet adhesiveness and coagulability of blood \" (Sircus 14) . Ultimately, when magnesium levels drop there is a cascade of physiological problems that corrupt heart health. Magnesium deficiency is also associated with increased intracellular calcium, which could also lead to insulin resistance (Sircus 14) . There is also a connection between high blood pressure and diabetes, due to the constriction of blood vessels that occurs in the absence of magnesium due to insulin resistance Steele 39 (Sircus 11) . Finally, several studies have shown that daily oral magnesium supplementation improved insulin sensitivity by 10 % and reduced blood sugar by 37 %. This confirms that magnesium plays a key role together with insulin in preventing diabetes and cardiovascular disease, the very ravages which Metabolism Syndrome X predicts. Cardiovascular Illnesses : Cholesterol/ Hypertension, Stroke and Coronary Artery Disease . It has been established the role which magnesium, together with insulin, plays in the alleviation of endothelialization of blood vessel walls , lipoprotein excess, plaque formation, platele t aggregation and vessel spasm. Using this concept as a basis, hypertension, st roke and coronary artery disease will be examined, with specific additions for how magnesium deficiency helps to precipitate each, and how these disease states may be helped by the 'beautiful mineral.' The AHA still reports that cholesterol is one of the m ajor controllable risk factors for cardiovascular disease (heart disease, heart attack and stroke) . And, high cholesterol along with high blood pressure, is considered a recipe for disaster (heart.org) . In fact, high blood pressure is an even stronger pred ictor of cardiovascular risk than high cholestero l (Sircus 108) . During this research, one article was found which would indicate that there may be no direct relationship between high cholesterol and high blood pressure (ncbi.nih.gov) . Howe ver, the medical community still regards cholesterol with a watchful eye . Cholesterol is a form of fat which circulates in the blood , and gets stored in the liver. It has many use ful functions in the human body: it stabilizes cel l membranes, insulates nerv es while comprising 60-80 % of our brain tissue, it is used to make hormones, for proper food absorption and to make bile salts. Cholesterol comes in three basic types. HDL are generally considered beneficial because they remove cholesterol from blood vess el walls and move it to the liver for processing and excretion. LDL are considered to be harmful because they move cholesterol into the bloodstream, which is Steele 40 thought to create plaque buildup in vessels. Finally, VLDL , which can be made into LDL, are consid ered potentially harmful as well (Dean 84) . However, these three types of cholesterols are normally present in the blood. What is not normal is the high amounts of oxidized cholesterol \u2014 that is, cholesterol abnormally bound to oxygen \u2014which is present in the body due to the intake of processed, fried, and fast foods. Chlorine, fluoride, pesticides, and other pollutants also oxidize cholesterol; it is this oxidized cholesterol that is of concerned when it com es to heart disease (Dean 85) . At one time, the publ ic was conditioned to believe that cholesterol was bad; this spawned the introduction of hydrogenated oils ; research in the 1990s proved that these oils were more dangerous that saturated animal fats (Dean 86) . In any case, the cholesterol scare is big bu siness for doctors and drug companies: statin s are the fourth -most prescribed type of drug today. The liver produces about 1000 mg of cholesterol per day. Statins are powerful drugs which block an enzyme in the liver to lower cholesterol. However, t his enzym e does much more in the body, so this type of suppression causes severe consequences. Statins disrupt liver functions and require periodic blood testing for liver damage. If liver damage is present, discontinuing the statin drug usually reverses the p roblem. Also, a well -known side effect of statins, or statin myopathy, is caused by muscle cell destruction called rhabdomyolysis, which leads to pain and tenderness. And along with muscle destruction comes the loss of magnesium which was stored in these s ites. Statins also bind irreversibly with magnesium, which also contributes to muscle pain (Dean 89) . However, a safer alternative is magnesium therapy . Liver cholesterol production requires an enzyme called HMG -CoA reductase; magnesium slows this enzymat ic reaction when present in sufficient quantities. Magnesium is a natural way to control cholesterol when it reaches a certain level. In contrast, statins destroy the whole process and deactivat es Coenzyme Q -10 in its wake \u2014which causes muscle and nerve da mage, memory Steele 41 decline, amnesia, and cardiomyopathy. Magnesium is also heart -protective in that it lowers LDL, raises HDL, and lowers triglycerides. As an added benefit, another magnesium -dependent enzyme converts Omega -3 and -6 fatty acids into prostagland ins, which promote h eart health and overall health (Dean 90) . A stroke , or cerebral vascular accident, is defined as \"the sudden death of brain cells due to lack of oxygen, caused by blockage of blood flow or rupture of an artery to the brain. Sudden loss of speech, weakness, or paralysis of one side of the body can be symptoms\" (medicinenet. com) . Stroke i s said to be caused by hypertension, atherosclerosis, and diabetic complications, all of which are associated with low magnesium. Strokes have devastated the lives of 4.6 million Americans, and 15 million people worldwide; each year about 700,000 new strok es occur, along with 100,000 recurrences, and statisticians say that the in cidence of stroke is increasing (Dean 78) . In fact, at the end of 2009, a stroke crisis in Europe has already cost the regional economy an estimated $56 billion a year, with numbers expected to rise as the population ages (Sircus 101) . The University Hospital of New Jersey estimat es the rates of ischemic -type stroke (caused by long-term plaque buildup and blood clot) to be in the vast majority at 83% (uhnj.org) . This is an area in which magnesium can be of benefit. Studies show that when normal or elevated magnesium is present in the brain, damage caused by stroke is reduced and ensuing neurological deficit is lessened. This is believed to be due to magnesium's ability to block calci um from flooding the cells and causing further injury. Decades of research show that withdrawal of magnesium from cerebral arteries cause vascular spasm, whereas elevated magnesium levels produce relaxation (Dean 81) . Further research indicates that the a rea of the brain damaged by stroke contains injured neurons that remain hyperactive for several hours after the stroke has occurred. These cells are frantically struggling to survive and need Steele 42 even more oxygen, glucose, and magnesium than normal. A study of stroke patients in New York illustrates the absolute requirement for magnesium intervention in the emergency room. Ninety -eight patients admitted to the emergency rooms of three hospitals with a diagnosis of stroke exhibited early and significant deficits in magnesium ions as measured with a sensitive ion-selective electrode. The stroke patients also demonstrated a high calcium -ion-to-magnesium - ion ratio, signs of increased vascular tone and cerebral vessel spasm (Dean 82) . Effective conventional stroke treatment can only be given within about a two hour window of time after the stroke has occurred. Sometimes the patients arrive at the hospital too late, and long -term neurologic deficits result. A study conducted in Los Angeles circa 2004 , called the Fast -Mag Pilot Trial, demonstrated that field initiation of magnesium in acute stroke is feasible, safe, and potentially efficacious; magnesium prevents cells from being flooded with calcium, thus preventing them from premature cell death. Researchers believe that magnesium slows chemical processes that kill 12 million brain cells per minute during untreated stroke (Sircus 95). Dr. Bruce Rind and Dr. Sean Dalton developed the RELOX procedure for stroke, an intravenous vitamin mineral solution, with heavy emphas is on magnesium, and the simultaneous application of oxygen by mask. This was administered to 200 patients who suffered aftereffects of stroke from periods ranging from a few days to twenty -plus years. Their results were miraculous. Patients with mild to m oderate impairment experienced \"moderate to significant, relatively sustained clinical recovery of cognitive, motor, and sensory functions after three 40 - minute treatments with no significant adverse effects. Follow -up SPECT scan nuclear imaging of the bra in confirmed these improvements (Dean 80) . This serves as further evidence that magnesium supplementation, even long after stroke, has a hugely beneficial effect. Steele 43 Heart disease takes first place as the number one killer of American men and women, and accou nts for half of all US deaths. According to the AHA, every thirty -three seconds someone in the US dies of cardiovascular disease. It takes a three -step process for a heart attack to occur: 1) vessel elasticity must be lost; 2) the inflammatory response beg ins with injury to the arterial wall, which leads to cholesterol and blood cells attempting to patch the damage, and 3) over time, steps 1 and 2 weaken and occlude the coronary arteries and this slowly destroys heart muscle through loss of blood and oxygen supply . Magnesium can help avoid this process. Daily magnesium supplementation can relax vessels and reduce inflammation (Dean 102) . Its role as calcium antagonist is emerging: the Agatston score is now being looked to a s the new and promising measurement tool for cardiac risk because it measures coronary calcium levels and can more accurately predict cardiac risk far beyond standard risk factors, such as cholesterol levels (Sircus 50) . Unfortunately, cardiologists are sl ow to get on board with magnesium therapy (Sircus 102). It is regrettable, because the evidence is clear: m agnesium deficiency is closely related with cardiovascular disease; lower magnesium concentrations have been found in heart attack patients. Magnesi um, calcium and potassium are all effective in decreasing blood pressure, and magnesium is especially effective at lowering the odds of death due to acute infarction by an impressive fifty-five percent Additionally, a balanced calcium/magnesium level is essential for a normal heart rate and rhythm , which can also help to avoid heart attack (Dean 113). OTHER USES AND BENEFITS OF MAGNESIUM Magnesium has such a monumental overall value in health maintenance and disease prevention, that additional uses and benefit bear at least some examination. Steele 44 Magnesium and calcium share importance equally in the human body . Biochemically, they act ant agonistically toward one another. Enzymes whose actions are critically dependent upon sufficient amounts of intracellular m agnesium, in an amount 10,000 times that of calcium within the cell, are adversely affected by tiny incr eases of intracellular calcium. This relationship takes on special meaning when it comes to conditions which are aggravated by the presence of excess ca lcium anywhere in the body where it is not designed to be. Magnesium keeps calcium in solution, and magnesium deficien cy results in various ailments: Fibromyalgia, muscle spasms, hardening of the arteries, and calcium deposits of all types in soft tissue w ill result. Excess calcium anywhere in the body, unchecked by adequate magnesium, can accelerate aging of cells and tissues \u2014calcified arteries, soft tissues and cells are all signs of aging. At age 80, the average calcium content in the aorta is 140 times greater than the levels found at age 40. Magnesium relieves mitochondrial calcification, and allows for the production of energy in the body, which has a tremendous benefit for those with low energy states, such as Chronic Fatigue Syndrome, Fibromyalgia, and others (Sircus 51). Kidney stones can form without adequate magnesium, and the bladder wall becomes calcified, leading to frequent urination. Magnesium is present in greater quantity than calcium in all muscles, especially those of the heart and blood vessels . Spasm, constricted blood vessels, angina and heart attack will occur due to an imbalance. Excess calcium can constrict the smooth muscle of the airways, causing restricted breathing or asthma. Without the protection of magnesium, calcium irritates the tiny nerves of the brain (Dean 21) . Magnesium is a powerful detoxifier, which gives it great potential for applications in cases of various autoimmune diseases , including cancer, the second leading cause of death (Sircus 85) . It not only ne utralize s toxins, it protects brain cells from the damaging effects of heavy metals such as aluminum, beryllium, ca dmium, lead, mercury and nickel, thus warding off Alzheimer's, Steele 45 Parkinson's, and other neurologic diseases. Magnesium competes in the small in testine with aluminum; if enough magnesium is present, aluminum cannot be absorbed. It supports the retention of glutathione in the body, which defends against damage from cigarette smok e, exposure to radiation, chemotherapy, alcohol and other toxins. Magnesium relaxes muscles and promotes calm, as an aid to ward off Restless Leg Syndrome and insomnia. And finally, magnesium, along with calcium and phosphorus, works to create and maintain strong teeth and bones (Czapp) . It seems there is nothing that the beautiful mineral can not do. MAGNESIUM DEFICIENCY IN ALLOPATHIC PRACTICE With all the emerging research proving the benefits of magnesium to prevent and treat so many illnesses, the question remains: why aren't doctors prescribing more magnesium? The reasons for this are many. First of all, doctors follow a medical model of disease and illness, which requires them to become knowledgeable about diseases and their current drug treatments. Nutrition and supplementation simply does not account for much of their training because they are learning about illness, not wellness . Doctors also have little time to spend in educating their patients about staying well (Dean 39). Original studies on magnesium were poorly controlled, and one study even caused some deat hs, which may have caused doctors to generally reject any potential benefits of magnesium (Sircus 113) . In addition to this, over the past two decades university funding has come from the pharmaceutical industry (Dean 40) . This could indicate a greatly bi ased focus with regard to what is being taught in medical schools . Huge amounts of pressure is being brought to bear on the government by the pharmaceutical industry: in 2009, Big Pharma lobbying expenses topped out at $273,945,917 (opensecrets.org) . The p ublic is inundated with commercial advertising for pharmaceuticals, perhaps to cause a cultural revolution in favor of pharmaceuticals, the industry having spent a whopping $5.2 billion on Steele 46 drug promotion. In contrast, nutrients, which are not patentable ; they do not make huge profits, generate a budget, or get much media attention (Dean 40) . Dr. Sarah Myhill states: There have been many studies showing that magnesium is clearly beneficial in heart disease. The trouble is the drug companies do not want to know. Magnesium is a serious competitor to their money -making pharmaceuticals. And so they set up a study [in wh ich study patients died from magnesium doses ten times the accepted dose] to deliberately blacken the name of magnesium (Sircus 114). Within the looming shadow cast by an overblown and autocratic pharmaceutical industry, a persistent grass roots effort is critical to substantially raise public awareness regarding the benefits of magnesium in order for change to occur. MAGNESIUM TESTING: A COMPARISON OF OPTIONS When looking for testing for magnesium deficiency, it is not as simple as just going to the docto r or the lab. The reason for this is that there may be some misunderstanding in the medical community when a patient requests a magnesium test. To determine the best type of testing for magnesium deficiency, it is best to understand where magnesium typical ly resides in the body. Magnesium is present in certain areas of th e body in specific amou nts. About 60 to 65 % of total magnesium is housed in the bo nes and teeth. Roughly 35 to 40% of total magnesium is found in electrically active areas, such as the brain and heart, and in the rest of the body, including muscles, tissues, cells and body fluids (Dean 14) . But, d espite all the metabolic processes which rely on magnesium, less than 1 percent of the total magnesium body content can be measured in blood; the remainder is at work in the cells and tissues or maintaining structural integrity of the body . As a result, it is nearly impossible to make an accurate assessment of the level of Steele 47 magnesium in various body tissues and cells by using a routine serum magn esium test. This test is often called a Total Serum Magnesium test, which sounds as if it relates to all the magnesium in the body . This, however, is not the case . Magnesium in the blood does not correlate with the amount of magnesium in other parts of the body. In fact, while influenced by stress due to illness , the body pumps magnesium out of the cells and into the blood, giving a false -normal result on testing in spite of an overall depletion. Unfortunately, most magnesium evaluations done in conventiona l medicine use the antiquated Serum Magnesium Test (Dean 218) . The Intracellular Free Magnesium test is a nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy test which has little routine use and great cost, which renders it impractical. Magnesium Loading, or Challenge, consists of a 24 -hour urine test on two separate occasions. The first urine collection is performed with the patient taking their normal supplementation regimen. Then, an intravenous infusion in an amount of 2 milliequivalents per kilogram of body weight of magnesium chloride or magnesium sulfate is given over a fo ur hour period. A second urine collection begins after the I.V., and every urine sample is collected for twenty -four hours. Deficiency is noted when the body holds on to more than twenty -five percent of the magnesium given. This test is best used for the rare persons who may be wasting magnesium (Dean 220) . The Ionized Magnesium Test which measures available free magnesium ions in the blood and is very accurate because the measurement of active ions in the blood gives a reliable accounting of the actual magnesium at work in the body. However, it requires expe nsive lab equipment which is not available at most sites, and is therefore reserved for research use ( Dean 222) . Two of the most available assays are the Buccal Cell Smear Test (EXATest) and the Total Red [Blood] Cell Magnesium Test (MgRBC). In the EXATest , cells are gently scraped from between the bottom teeth and the back of the tongue. This is performed at a doctor's office, Steele 48 and gives an accurate measurement of the amount of magnesium in the cells of the body. It is expensive, but may be covered by Medic are or other insurance. The MgRBC measures the amount of magnesium inside the red blood cells. More accurate than the serum test, but less accurate than EXATest, it is a good option because it can be ordered over the internet if a person is unable to obtai n a prescription. The cost is about $50, a ZIP code must be provided, and the service will arrange the blood draw at a local lab. Results are available within 72 hours. Dr. Dean recommends that this test be done as a baseline, and levels should be rechecke d every three to four months. Normal ranges for this test are as units of measure are provided, as unit of measure used may vary by lab (Dean xxxviii) . MAGNESIUM REQUIREMENTS It has been presented that magnesium deficiency is a condition which has been precipitated by our modern existence. In fact, the factors which cause magnesium deficiency are varied and numerous. Stressors alone use up large amounts of magnesiu m in the body. It has been argued by magnesium experts that the Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) for magnesium should be increased (Dean 216) . Table 3 provides the most current RDA information available. Table 3 . 2016 RDA ( consumerlab.com) 2016 RECOMMENDED D IETARY ALLOWANCES FOR MAGNESIUM Life Stage Children Men Women Pregnancy Lactation Age 1 - 3 years 80mg N/A N/A MAGNESIUMS SOURCES Food. Green, leafy vegetable, seeds, tree nuts and whole grains are good sources of magnesium, but only if they come from a well -mineralized farm. Wild foods, such as nettles (869mg per 100 grams) and chickweed (529mg per 100 grams) have great benefits for humans and livestock. Kelp stands out with other sea vegetables as having the highest content of magnesium because they are continually drenched in sea water , which is also high in magnesium. Sea salt is also a good source of magne sium, as well as trace minerals (Czapp). Bone broth taken on a daily basis is as easily assimilated source of many minerals, including magnesium (Dean xl ). Additionally, legumes and unprocessed grains should be included in the diet to increase magnesium intake. Grains must be unprocessed, because removal of the germ and bran eliminates most of the magnesium which is present in the whole grain. It is recommen ded to supplement a diet consisting of vegetables , fruits, and protein -rich foods such as fish, meat, and milk by eating wheat germ, kelp, brewer's yeast, sunflower seeds, and pumpkin seeds, which are all rich in magnesium. More raw foods should be eaten, as cooked and processed foods are mineral -poor. Nuts, seeds, and many vegetables can be eaten raw, and raw wheat germ can be used on cereal and in protein drinks (Dean 227) . To protect heart and blood vessels, reduce saturated fats, increase monounsaturate d fat and omega -3 fatty acids (found in fish and flaxseed), cereals, fruits, vegetables, and low -fat dairy products, which are rich in magnesium. Alcohol should be limited. Table 4 lists the magnesiu m content found in common foods. Steele 50 Table 4. Magnesium Content of Common Foods (Dean 255) MAGNESIUM CONTENT OF COMMON FOODS Food Magnesium (mg) per 3 \u00bd oz. (100g) serving Food Magnesium (mg) per 3 \u00bd oz.

Given ideal conditions of digestive functions and quality food supply, only a small amount of magnesium taken in food will be absorbed. Magnesium is better absorbed when the body is deficient; however, since limited magnesium can be obtained from foods, sup plementation is crucial. Certain people \u2014those with advanced kidney disease, Steele 51 extremely slow heart rate, Myasthenia Gravis, or bowel obstruction \u2014should avoid magnesium supplementation. About 3 to 10 milligrams per pound of body weight, depending upon physica l condition, growth requirements (in children), and degree of symptoms, is recommended (Czapp , Dean 240 ). Specifically, the rule of thumb recommended to individualize magnesium dosage is 6 to 8 mg/kg (3.0 to 4.5 mg/lb) of body weight per day. This equals t otal dietary and supplemental magnesium of 600 to 900 mg per day for a 200 -lb man. Researchers recommend 10 mg/kg/day for children due to their low body weight and increased growth needs. Athletes need 6 to 10 mg/kg/day, depending on traini ng levels and ph ysical stress. With supplementation, periodic testing to reach the optimum blood level of 6.5 mg/dl is a sure way to correct magnesium levels (Dean 240) . Rates of magnesium absorption by oral supplementation vary from 4 to 50 percent, depending on type and absorption ability (Dean 241) . Some forms of magnesium work better for some than for others, and a bit of experimentation may be needed. Loose stools are a failsafe mechanism which occur s if magnesium is being poorly absorbed, or if too much is taken. If this is the case, partial doses may be taken in early morning and at bedtime; if a third dose is needed, then it should be taken in late afternoon. These times coincide with when the body is lowest in magnesium (Czapp) . Magnesium should be taken between m eals, because it needs plenty of stomach acid for better absorption. People with gas and bloating problems may have insufficient hydrochloric acid in the stomach, and may need to take magnesium with a digestive aid, such as betaine hydrochloride, to help a bsorb minerals (Dean 247) . Also, if magnesium supplementation has never been tried before, or the individual h as multiple symptoms which indicate a fair amount of deficiency, it is best to start low and increase the dose: suddenly flooding the body magne sium may cause a healing crisis (Dean xlv) . Steele 52 There are many magnesium supplement options to choose from , for all purposes and pocketbooks . Magnesium is available in tablets, capsules, powder, salts, and liquid oral and (in healthcare facilities) I.V. form s. Magnesium can be chelated, or bound to an amino acid, for less laxative effect. Magnesium taurate, glycinate, and orotate are all magnesium. Magnesium taurate is particul arly helpful for heart health. Magnesium supplements can be in picometer form, which means that the magnesium particles are in a tiny, ionized form, similar in size to plant magnesium. This type of magnesium supplement is highly absorbed with no bowel effect, but tends to be quite expensive. Magnesium malate contains magnesium weakly bonded to malic acid. It is readily soluble, and malic acid is an important component in several energy -producing processes, making this a good supplement for those with Chronic Fatigue Syndrome and Fibromyalgia. Magnesium chloride, available in capsules, powder, picometer (and I.V.) forms, is best for those with insufficient stomach acid, or who take antacid s. The chloride in this form actually helps to produce more hydrochloric acid in the stomach (Dean 241 -246). Magnesium citrate is the most wi dely used magnesium supplement, due to only minor laxative effect and because it is inexpensive. It is also widely available in drug stores , as a 12,000 mg dose of this liquid is routinely ordered by doctors for a bowel purge prior to colon exams. At health food stores, it is also available in powder or capsule form (Dean 24 2). Also, for people with absorption diffic ulties such as reduced stomach acid or gut dysbiosis, homeopathic Magnesia phosphorica 6X cell salt is an option which should be considered. It helps magnesium get directly into the cells where it is most needed, relieves muscle cramps, and reduces or eliminates loose stools while other oral supplementation is taken. Another option is ionic liquid magne sium: just one teaspoon delivers 400 mg of magnesium plus 72 other minerals. This should be taken in divided doses through the day (Czapp) . Steele 53 An adjunct therapy is transdermal magnesium supplementation. Oral magnesium must reside in the intestine for at lea st 12 hours for reliable absorption (Sircus 156) . Magnesium taken through the skin bypasses the stomach and liver, which translates in into a greater percentage of magnesium going directly into the bloodstream for use. Also, there is no bowel effect via t his route. Transdermal magnesium is excellent for pain management, and magnesium chloride , commonly known as Epsom salts , in a bath draws inflammation out of muscles and joints (Sircus 151). Transdermal a bsorption rates ca n vary widely, though. Fick's Law of Membrane Permeability states that \"the amount of solute (magnesium) that will be absorbed is directly dependent upon the area of contact, the concentration of the solution and the time that the solute is in contact with the membrane\" (Sircus 160) . The condition of skin, whether thin or thick , and the size of the skin surface exposed to magnesium will vary the dose. Epsom salts product labels recommend using 2 cups per bath; Dr. Sircus recommends using several cups to several pounds of Epsom salts in ve ry warm water, one to three times per week for 20 minutes (Sircus 181) . Strong ther apeutic foot soaks can be taken, and are especially good for diabetics with neuropathy. Product labels recommend using \u00bd cup of Epsom salts in a foot bath; Dr. Sircus recommends to use 108F water and start with this low amount of magnesium and increasing the concentration. Therapeutic foot baths can be ta ken daily for the first week, then two to three times weekly for at least 6 to 8 weeks to improve neuropathy (Sircus 162) . Pure magnesium oil spray has a concentration of about 80,000 mg per liter; when sprayed on the skin, the intake rate is high. Each spray of magnesium oil contain roughly 18 mg of elemental magnesium, and 5 sprays equal nea rly 100 mg (Sircus 160) . Side effect of the spray oil is a transient tingling or mild burning sensation of the skin. If this is too uncomfortable, it should be diluted with water at a 1:1 ratio (Sircus 181) . Both Epsom salts baths and magnesium Steele 54 oil appl ication should be adjusted downward for children depending on their age and size (Sircus 161). As with all therapeutic use of magnesium, it is best to monitor levels with periodic testing. CONCLUSION Magnesium is a safe, effective, inexpensive , non-polluting and natural treatment for ailments of all types. Taken orally and transdermally, it can help most anyone to achieve a higher level of natural health. Magnesium can achieve therapeutic reversal of conditions through nutritional support while conventional medicines only work in terms of symptoms management at the cost of wasting precious body resources. In the naturopathic field, we must do all we can to help educate doctors, the agricultural sector, and most especially, the consumer public a s to its wellspring of health benefits.
