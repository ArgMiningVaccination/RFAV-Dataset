It is the foundation of health. If our body cannot efficiently digest and absorb nutrients and remove waste products, it's almost impossible to achieve optimal health. Eighty percent of our immune system is located in and around the digestive system. We have more neurotransmitters in our gut than we do in our brain. The gut-brain connection is heavily underestimated in regards to overall health. An individualized approach is important for the health of our digestive system, as well as the health of our body as a whole. Naturopathic Physicians see digestion as a key piece of any treatment plan. Common approaches to digestive wellness might include dietary modification, food sensitivity identification and desensitization, nutritional supplementation, and utilizing detoxification to strengthen your immune support. Improving your digestive health will help improve your overall health as well as improving your immune system. "}
