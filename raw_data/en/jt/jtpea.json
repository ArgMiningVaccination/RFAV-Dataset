PREAMBLE Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery is a unique specialty that defies definition, has no organ system of its own, is based on principles rather than specific procedures. It pertains to restoring form and functions and, in many situations, enhancing it. The scope ranges from the top of the Calvarium to the bottom of the sole. It has also been defined as a 'Problem solving specialty'- solving problems related to many other specialties. The range of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery has expanded by leaps and bounds in the past few decades. Thus, a structured program for a comprehensive training in the wide range of Plastic and Reconstructive surgery is the need of the hour as it would lay down the gold standard for training across all the platforms in the country. Moreover, it will also help in standardizing the training of future plastic surgeons. This comprehensive document has been prepared keeping this need in mind. The core idea all through has been to prepare a curriculum that is inclusive of theoretical knowledge, practical aspects, and the desired operative capabilities of the trainee. The document will help the teachers micromanage the nitty gritty of the daily training and teaching assignments. At the end of the 3-year training, the candidate would be equipped with vast knowledge, skills, the right aptitude to function as an independent, knowledgeable consultant, teacher and researcher. SUBJECT SPECIFIC LEARNING OBJECTIVES (Complete details in annexure II available with Expert Group members) The aim of course is to produce plastic surgeons capable of setting standards and demonstrate commensurate expertise in the field. The training should aim to facilitate the candidate's acquisition of a judicious mix of the three domains of learning that will be practiced ethically: - - Cognitive (knowledge) domain, - Affective (communication) domain, and - Psychomotor (practice) domain. i. COGNITIVE DOMAIN (KNOWLEDGE DOMAIN) - Understand the basic sciences (embryology, anatomy, physiology, biochemistry, pharmaco-therapeutics etc.) and principles of plastic surgical care as applicable to practice in plastic surgery. - Be conversant with the embryology, aetiology, pathophysiology, diagnosis and management of common (elective or emergency) conditions requiring plastic surgical intervention. - Be conversant with principles guiding care with reference to plastic surgery, aesthetic medicine and surgery and burn management. - Group approach: Recognize the role of multidisciplinary and interdisciplinary approach in the management of various conditions requiring plastic surgery so as to obtain relevant specialist consultation, where appropriate. - Research Methodology: Basic knowledge of research methodology and bio- statistics; familiarity and participation in clinical and experimental research studies; involvement in scientific presentation and publication.

TEACHING AND LEARNING METHODS GENERAL PRINCIPLES: The syllabus has been designed to ensure competency-based training of the student during the 3 years. This will cover the Cognitive, Psychomotor and Affective domains. The training will essentially be self-directed and revolve around practical skills acquired from graded patient care responsibilities and formal academic sessions. Trainees are expected to be fully conversant with the use of computers (documentation, editing and presentation software (word, power point, excel etc.)) and be able to use databases like the Medline, PubMed etc. PATIENT CARE RESPONSIBILITIES: The student will be posted in the OPD, Wards, Operation theatres and the Emergency medicine where he will participate in patient care responsibilities - History taking, - Clinical Examination, - Documentation : Clinical notes, Clinical photographs, - Progress notes, - Order and interpret relevant investigations, - Treatment planning, - Make a pattern of the treatment plan where indicated, - Counsel the patient or relatives regarding the procedure to be undertaken, - Take informed consent, - Assist or perform the surgical treatment, - Coordinate care and rehabilitation with other ancillary departments. FORMAL ACADEMIC SESSIONS: Below is a suggested Academic schedule that could be followed: | | Sr. No. | | Description | | Frequency | | 1 | | Subject seminars | | Once a week | | 2 | | Journal club | | Once in two weeks | | 3 | | Didactic lectures by faculty | | Once a month | | 4 | | Bedside teaching | | As and when feasible | | 5 | | Clinical rounds | | Once a week | | 6 | | Structured interactive group discussions (Including buzz sessions, debates, problem-based learning etc) | | Once a week | | 7 | | Case Presentation and Treatment Planning | | Once a week | | 8 | | File Audit/Statistic Meet/Mortality and Morbidity Audit | | Once month | | 9 | | Cadaver dissections | | As and when possible/ Once a week | | 10 | | Skills Laboratory | | Daily/ Weekly/ Once a month (as per requirement) | | 11 | | Grand Round/Interdepartmental Meet | | Once a month The following things have to be considered in the formal teaching program - PG students shall be required to participate in the teaching and training programme of Undergraduate students and interns. - The department should encourage e-learning activities. EXTERNAL POSTINGS: As it is not possible for all departments to expose the student to all aspects of Plastic and reconstructive surgery, it is recommended (if permissible) that the student be permitted external postings to departments of excellence in various subspecialties for a period of 2 weeks to a month at a time, a total of three months being permitted during a period of 3 years. This is provided that the student has shown the required progress and worked to the satisfaction of the faculty members and head of the department, availability of permissible leave of absence as per the concerned University Rules & Regulations. The sub-speciality where posting may be done would include: - Burns - Hand surgery - Microvascular surgery - Aesthetic surgery - Cleft and craniofacial surgery - Others as deemed useful by the HOD and student i. Orthopaedics ii. Anaesthesia iii. Oncosurgery iv. Radiodiagnosis PAPER PRESENTATION AND PUBLICATION (Compulsory) A postgraduate student would be required to present one poster, read one paper at a national/state conference and to present one research paper which should be published/accepted for publication/sent for publication during the period of his postgraduate studies so as to make him eligible to appear at the postgraduate degree examination. RESEARCH METHODOLOGY/ THESIS: (Optional) It is desirable for the trainee to take up a thesis during their posting and complete it before their training ends. During the training programme, patient safety is of paramount importance; therefore, skills are to be learnt initially on the models, later to be performed under supervision followed by performing independently. For this purpose, provision of skills laboratories in medical colleges is mandatory. ASSESSMENT GENERAL PRINCIPLES Internal Assessment should be frequent, cover all domains of learning and used to provide feedback to improve learning; it should also cover professionalism and communication skills. The Internal Assessment should be conducted in theory and practical/clinical examination. FORMATIVE ASSESSMENT Formative assessment should be continual and should assess medical knowledge, patient care, procedural & academic skills, interpersonal skills, professionalism, self-directed learning and ability to practice in the system. INTERNAL ASSESSMENT The student to be assessed periodically as per categories listed in postgraduate student appraisal form (Annexure I). QUARTERLY ASSESSMENT 1. Patient based: - Documentation of case records - Progress notes iii. Clinical photographs - Laboratory or Skill based learning: - Cadaver dissection - Microvascular laboratory - Learning on simulation models 3. Self-directed learning and teaching: - Seminar: departmental - Journal based / recent advances learning iii. Case presentation and treatment planning. The department could also conduct an annual assessment on the lines of the final Summative assessment. SUMMATIVE ASSESSMENT: Assessment at the end of training. The summative examination would be carried out as per the Rules given in POSTGRADUATE MEDICAL EDUCATION REGULATIONS, 2000. The Post graduate examination shall be in two parts: The examinations shall be organised based on 'Grading' or 'Marking system' to evaluate and to certify post graduate student's level of knowledge, skill and competence at the end of the training. - Log book of work done during the training period including rotation postings, departmental presentations, and internal assessment reports should be submitted. - At least two presentations at national level conference. At least one research paper should be published/ accepted in an indexed journal. (It is suggested that the local or University Review committee assess the work sent for publication). There will be four theory papers based on broad distribution, as below: Paper I: General principles and basic sciences relevant to plastic and reconstructive surgery. Paper II: Clinical part I- Burns, Cleft and Craniofacial, Micro neurovascular and Brachial plexus, Hand and upper extremity surgery Paper III: Clinical part II- Aesthetic surgery, Head and neck, Breast, Trunk, Genitalia, Lower limb surgery Paper IV: Recent Advances in Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery - Clinical Examination - Long case: Should assess the students' ability to diagnose a complex condition, order and interpret relevant investigations and plan the reconstruction of a composite defect. - Short cases: 2 or 3: Each case would assess one or more aspects of one of areas of reconstruction. - Ward rounds: 4 cases: Assess the students' ability to counsel a patient or relatives about a procedure, possible complications, expected results and post-operative management. It could also assess his ability to anticipate complications, prevent them and manage them should they occur. 2. Viva voce - Surgical planning - Operative procedures - Instruments - Radiology: X-rays, CT scan, - Osteology (Skull, Mandible, Hand, Fibula) - Photographs based viva. LOG BOOK: The student will maintain a comprehensive log of: - Cases operated- observed, assisted, performed independently, - Seminars presented/ attended, - Faculty lectures attended, - Journal presentations made and attended, - Conferences/webinars attended, and presentations made. WORK RECORD: PHOTO ALBUM: The student will maintain photographic documentation of the important cases operated or assisted including relevant post-operative follow up.
