Rosemary oil is one of those unique ingredients that don't just offer benefits for your physical health but also work wonders for your mental health. From relieving pain and aiding digestion to reducing anxiety, rosemary oil covers just about every base. Let's look at all benefits it has to offer in detail. 1. Boosts Immune System When it comes to protecting your body from diseases, antioxidants are one of your biggest weapons. Rosemary oil contains myrcene, a chemical that acts as a powerful antioxidants and hunt down free radicals that can damage your cells and cause a number of infections and diseases. Thus, inhaling rosemary oil on a regular basis can help boost your immune system ( [1](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0308814608001520)). 2. Is Anti-inflammatory Suffering from aches and pains that never seem to go away? Then, it's time you started massaging those areas with rosemary essential oil. This oil works as a powerful anti-inflammatory agent as it contains -pinene that works to alleviate swelling and pain ( [2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19053868)). 3. Promotes Digestion This may sound a bit weird to you but rubbing rosemary oil on your stomach and the bottom of your feet can actually aid digestion. How, you ask? It's because rosemary oil improves the quality of gastric acid secretion and the volume of bile produced by the liver - two components that are necessary for good digestion. Thus, it can help [relieve constipation](https://www.stylecraze.com/articles/effective-home-remedies-to-cure-constipation/), stomach cramps, bloating, flatulence (yes, I mean farts), and symptoms of dyspepsiai [X]Indigestion, which may be accompanied with upper abdominal pain, bloating, or a burning sensation followed by nausea. ( [3](https://books.google.co.in/books?id=ELvWZvGuk6AC&pg=PA114&dq=rosemary+oil+for+digestion&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjUxvTV7ojYAhWKO48KHQ7VBTEQ6AEIMTAC#v=onepage&q=rosemary%20oil%20for%20digestion&f=false)). 4. Alleviates Muscle And Joint Pain When it comes to combating pain, rosemary is somewhat of a triple threat due to its 1,8-cineole, alpha-pinene, and camphor content. It's an analgesic (reduces pain), anti-inflammatory (reduces swelling), and an anti-nociceptive (blocks the sensation of pain). Therefore, it has traditionally been used to alleviate muscle pain, joint pain, sprains, and the symptoms of [ arthritis](https://www.stylecraze.com/articles/how-to-get-rid-of-arthritis-in-fingers/) and rheumatismi [X]chronic disease that causes severe inflammation and pain in bones, joints, and muscles. . Though rosemary oil has been approved by the German Commission E for treating these conditions and proven to have these effects in rats, there's no conclusive scientific evidence that it does so in humans ( [4](http://www.umm.edu/health/medical/altmed/herb/rosemary)), ( [5](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24498797)). 5. Increases Circulation The topical use of rosemary oil has been found to improve blood circulation in that area ( [6](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0944711309002554)). [Improved blood circulation](https://www.stylecraze.com/articles/effective-home-remedies-for-improving-blood-circulation/) can offer a host of other benefits like pain relief and aid rapid blood clotting, which, in turn, can speed up wound healing and promote hair growth. 6. Cures Headaches Are frequent headaches and migraines making you miss school/work? Then, all you need to do is rub a couple of drops of rosemary oil between your palms and cup them over your nose and mouth. The pain relieving property of this potent essential oil has been found to be very effective for use as a natural remedy for headaches ( [7](http://www.koreascience.or.kr/article/ArticleFullRecord.jsp?cn=GCJOBO_2010_v12n3_133)). 7. Relieves Cough, Cold, And Flu Time for a little quiz. What's the common factor between a cough, a cold, and a flu? Yep, they're all caused by bacterial or viral infections. Rosemary essential oil, when inhaled, acts as a potent antimicrobial agent and fights off these infections ( [8](https://bmccomplementalternmed.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1472-6882-6-39)). 8. Helps To Improve Respiratory Activity If you want to breathe easy, it's time you picked up a bottle of rosemary essential oil. This powerful oil has been found to provide significant relief when it comes to respiratory disorders ( [9](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10641130)). The eucalyptol (1,8-cineole) and camphor present in rosemary oil help dilate the bronchi in your lungs and aid better flow of air. Thus, it helps in relieving a number of respiratory problems like clearing the chest and nasal congestion, reducing cough, cold, and sore throat, and treating symptoms of respiratory allergies and sinusitisi [X]A condition caused by fluid build-up in the sinuses, leading to virus or bacterial infection. . Rosemary oil also possesses an antispasmodic property (relieves muscular spasms) that works well in treating bronchial asthma. 9. Lowers Stress Whenever you feel stressed or have that all too familiar \"fight-or-flight\" urge, it's nothing but the hormone cortisol that is being released into your body. Anyone who suffers from chronic stress can have an excess of cortisol being released in their body, which could ruin the delicate hormonal balance and disturb the normal metabolism, thus giving way to a number of other diseases. But there's good news! Smelling rosemary oil has been found to reduce the level of cortisol in saliva significantly ( [10](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165178106000114)). So, the next time you feel like the stress of day-to-day life is getting to you, indulge in some aromatherapy with rosemary oil. 10. Helps Fight Cancer A lot of research is currently going on to test the effect of rosemary oil on cancer. Carnosol, a component of rosemary oil, has shown particularly promising results in fighting cancer ( [11](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21382660)). Extensive research done on animals has also proven the anti-cancer effect of rosemary oil on the colon, pancreas, breast, prostate, cervical, bladder, ovarian cancer, and leukemia ( [12](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5133115/)). It has also been shown to inhibit the spread of liver carcinomai [X]A type of liver cancer that commonly affects people with liver disease or chronic hepatitis B and C. and slow down the growth of tumors ( [13](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0896844612002458)). However, there is still a long way to go before an undisputed link is found between rosemary oil and its anticancer effects. 11. Removes Bad Odor We all know that rosemary oil emits a lovely fragrance that is unmatched by any other scent. But what you probably didn't know is that it's the volatile compound myrcene found in this essential oil that lends it this pleasant fragrance. Rosemary oil is extensively used in room fresheners, diffusers, and scented candles to remove bad odors. It is also used in cosmetics, scented bath products, and perfumes. 12. Prevents STDs Rosemary essential oil contains two very important compounds - beta-pinene and limonene - that possess antiviral properties. These two components have been found to reduce the infectivity of the herpes virus by an astonishing 100% when tested in-vitro ( [14](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4393490/)). However, extensive research still needs to be done to see how effective the oil would be when inhaled or used topically to actually reduce the symptoms and infectivity of STDs in a real-life scenario. 13. Boosts Oral Health Half a teaspoon of rosemary oil mixed in a cup of distilled water works as an excellent mouthwash. The antibacterial activity of rosemary oil helps prevent cavities, gingivitisi [X]A form of gum disease affecting an area of the gum right at the base of your teeth, causing inflammation and swelling. , and plaque build-up. It even gets rid of the bacteria Streptococcus sobrinus that takes root in your tooth cavities and is a major cause of tooth decay ( [15](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0308814606009198)). 14. Aids Liver Detoxification And Enhances Gallbladder Function Multiple research studies have proven that the antioxidant property of rosemary oil helps in healing injured liver cells in rats and also stops the spread of cancerous cells in liver cells in-vitro ( [16](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4227022/)), ( [17](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20646355)). Inhaling rosemary has also been known to regulate the production and storage of bile by the liver and [ gallbladder](https://www.stylecraze.com/articles/home-remedies-to-get-rid-of-gallstones/), thus improving the functioning of the digestive system. 15. Improves Cognitive Function The next time you find yourself getting distracted while studying for an exam or just can't seem to focus on the work assignment at hand, inhale some rosemary oil or add a few drops of it in your room diffuser. Not only does it help improve concentration, but it is also great for boosting memory ( [18](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00207450390161903)). 16. Helps Reduce Nervous Tension And Fatigue Inhaling rosemary oil when you're feeling fatigued or tensed acts as a stimulant and helps increase your blood pressure, heart rate, and respiratory rate. This, in turn, helps you feel fresher and more energized ( [19](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3700080/)). 17. Works As An Antidepressant Another great way that rosemary oil benefits mental health is by acting as an antidepressant. The carnosol and betulinic acid found in rosemary oil have been found create an antidepressant effect in rats ( [20](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0308814612014306)). Aromatherapy using rosemary oil also helps in relaxation and treats symptoms of depression ( [21](http://www.umm.edu/health/medical/altmed/condition/depression)). 18.
