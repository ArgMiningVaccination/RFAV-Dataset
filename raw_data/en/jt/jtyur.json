He claims that numerous toxins, including thimerosal, are present in vaccines that are forced into the bloodstream, later causing neurological and brain damage to children. He says that autism has risen by 78 percent over the past decade, and that 1/88 children in the US have an autistic disorder. Snyder believes that most autistic individuals start out completely normal, and that the vaccinations they are given are harming them. He blames the pharmaceutical companies for being too All About Autism Every parent wants to do the best they can, and when things don't go as planned, they question if their parenting skills are good enough. When Heather found out her children both had Autism, she would compare them to others, knowing they would never be normal; always questioning Barrett, Julia R. \"Pediatric Vaccines And Neurodevelopment.\" Environmental Health Perspectives 123.6 (2015): A156. Academic Search Premier. Web. 4 Nov. 2015. This article focuses on a specific ingredient, Thimerosal, and its relationship to autism. The study finds that there is no correlation between the two when used on Macaques who have similar learning and memory processes and social interaction as humans. The main argument is against the link between vaccination and autism and the scholarly article aims to prove this through the use of a study. The article is neutral in terms of bias as it provides factual information based off of studies. It is a relevant source as it talks about a study showing there is no correlation between autism and vaccination. The article ends with a list of sources and references to check its facts and data. This source will help me in my essay as it helps to disprove the myth of autism and vaccination. Many parents refuse to vaccinate their children because they believe the myth that vaccines lead to autism. Most anti-vaccination parents rely on information from a 1998 British study where the Measles, Mumps, and Rubella (MMR) vaccine was In this essay, not only will I be stating the facts about autism as a disease, but I will also investigate the spreading claims of a connection between it and vaccination; especially those given during infancy and early childhood period. People who aren't vaccinated will die. This is a fact. Vaccines causing Autism is not a fact. People claim that children who receive medicine to protect from harmful diseases will be plucked away and thrown somewhere on the spectrum. This is very untrue, and I will prove it in the essay. Thimerosal is a preservative that contains 49.6% mercury. It was most commonly used in the 1930's to prevent the contamination by bacteria of vaccines. Particularly for children, mercury is dangerous to neurological development. It is known to impair a child's growing brain and nervous system. Memory, attention, language, and fine motor and visual spatial skills are all compromised when a child is exposed to mercury (\"Health Effects.\"). These facts would lead anyone to believe thimerosal containing vaccines cause autism. However, after extreme scrutiny by U.S. congress and the media, thimerosal has been removed from vaccines for children. Although thimerosal is still used in the influenza vaccine, it is not mandatory for a child to receive this vaccine (\"Vaccines and Thimerosal.\"). With the removal of thimerosal, children still have autism. It is not possible to blame this ingredient as a cause of autism if it is no longer used. Within the past two decades, it has been rumored that the mercury content in commonly-recommended vaccines is responsible for the development of autism in young children. The rumor has caused many parents to deny their children the acceptance of vaccines such as the one given to prevent measles, mumps, and rubella. Despite the fact that scientific research has conclusively disproved the claims made against immunization, many new parents are choosing to raise their infants naturally, that is, without injecting foreign substances into the children's developing bodies.The new age ideals of the anti-vaccine community seem like a desirable approach to raising a healthy child, however, the lack of immunization in the younger population is causing outbreaks of harmful diseases that had previously been eliminated from our first world society. According to the CDC, thimerosal is a \"mercury-based preservative used to prevent contamination of multi dose vials of vaccines.\" Research has shown that thimerosal does not cause autism. In fact, a 2004 scientific review by the Institute of Medicine concluded that \"The evidence favors rejection of a causal relationship between thimerosal-containing vaccines and autism.\" The CDC says, \"Since 2003, there have been nine CDC-funded or conducted studies that have found no link between thimerosal-containing vaccines and ASD, as well as no link between the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine and autism spectrum disorder in children\" (CDC). There is no proof that vaccines don't cause autism: more than 40 studies show that there is no link between the two. It has been noted that over the last fifteen years there seems to have been an explosion of children being diagnosed with autism. If someone wants to, they can Google the word autism and they would be amazed at how many websites would come up showing proof that there has This article is based on the retrospective analysis between the timeframe of 1980 to 1994 with the data of the children in kindergarten who received MMR immunization and the children born and diagnosed with autism during these years from California Department of Developmental Services regional service center system. There is awareness raised a possible association between the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine and autism. The MMR vaccine and autism onset can occur by chance alone, since MMR vaccine is typically given at age of 12 to 15 months of age and parents with autistic children first start to notice the signs at the age of 18 to 19 months. However, this does not necessarily proves that vaccinations may cause autism. Due to lack The introduction of vaccines has been a great advancement in the world of medicine. This ground- breaking discovery has a tremendous effect on health care by putting an end to diseases that might otherwise be untreatable. Diseases such as typhoid, whooping cough, and polio which threaten many countries worldwide Refrigerator Mother Theory. Initially, Leo Kanner (1943), a child psychiatrist at the Johns Hopkins University, introduced the term \"early infantile autism\" in 1943. He considered that the refrigerator mother triggered early infantile autism. In other words, he believed that the autism was developed after the birth, and lack of parental There is a fear among many Americans that vaccinating their children will lead their children to develop Autism. This belief can usually be traced back to the Wakefield study, published in Lancet in 1988, which followed twelve children and seemed to show a link between the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine and the development of Autism (Deer). This study later proved to be full of false information. The study was retracted from Lancet and Wakefield was labeled a fraud in the medical community. A more recent study followed 15 million children and found no link between vaccines and Autism. Medical professionals claim that autism is "}
