Hepatitis A You may come into contact with the [Hepatitis A virus](http://www.travelvaccinationclinic.com.au/vaccines/hepatitis-a) in Hong Kong - and this can occur anywhere you decide to stay and eat. It is highly likely you will recomended the Hepatitis A vaccination before leaving home, unless you have recently had it.

Typhoid Typhoid is a virus with flu-like symptoms that exists in Hong Kong (and throughout other parts of the world). The typhoid virus can be passed on to travellers through contaminated food or water, which is not highly likely in Hong Kong but could be a major risk if you travel throughout Asia or Mainland China once leaving Hong Kong. To learn more, read the general information on this vaccine on the [Typhoid information page](http://www.travelvaccinationclinic.com.au/vaccines/typhoid). Rural areas usually pose an increased risk for typhoid infection, and much of Botswana is undeveloped rural land. Both Hepatitis A and Typhoid vaccinations can be given to you in one shot, and this lasts for a number of years. [Ask the Travel Vaccination Clinic](http://www.travelvaccinationclinic.com.au/book-online) about getting vaccinated against Hepatitis A and Typhoid, as well as taking food safety precautions to keep your risk of exposure minimal.

Avian Flu and other risks associated with travel to Hong Kong Hong Kong is home to the most densely populated district in any city on earth, Kowloon, so travellers and locals alike are rightly concerned that viruses such as avian flu may be passed around easily. Taking usual, sensible precautions and seeking medical attention if necessary should keep you safe. While there have been some cases of avian flu reported since 2013, they mostly occurred in people who had been to Mainland China, and the risk is not considered great for people in Hong Kong. Air Pollution Air pollution, which may affect those with sinus issues, chest infections or diseases affecting the lungs and respiratory system are another concern in Hong Kong. On days when the air pollution reading is dangerously high, people who might have issues are advised to remain mostly indoors, and not do anything too physically stressful while outside. "}
