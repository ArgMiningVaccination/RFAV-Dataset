The foam forms an aqueous film that rapidly cuts off the oxygen supply and knocks down a fire. AFFF discharges from vessels have the potential for an adverse environmental impact . AFFF is considered a polyfluoroalkyl substance ( PFAS). PFAS is now identified as a HM meaning it must be managed as such. Bilge Water/Oil- Water Separator (OWS) : The surface vessel bilge water /OWS discharge consists of a mixture of wastewater and leakage from a variety of sources that are allowed to drain to the lowest inner part of the hull, known as the bilge. Vessels with oil content monitor (OCMs) have the capability to return bilge water not meeting a preset oil concentration limit to the OWS for reprocessing until the limit is met . Oil collected from the OWS separation process is held in a recovered oil tank until transferred to shore facilities for processi ng. Best Management Practices (BMPs) : BMPs are techniques, processes, or procedures used to prevent or reduce pollutant discharges to the environment , which includes land and surface waters . BMPs may include simple procedures for controlling pollution such as good housekeeping, spill response, spill prevention, spill r eporting and equipment maintenance. BMPs may also include temporary berms around equipment, specific processes, or material storage areas. Clean ballast : If discharged from a vessel that is stationary into clean, calm water on a clear day, would not - i. Produce visible traces of oil on the surface of the water or on adjoining shore lines; or ii. Cause a sludge or emulsion to be deposited beneath the surface of the water or upon adjoining shore lines; or iii. If verified by an approved oil discharge monitoring and control system, has an oil content that does not exceed 15 ppm. Collection , Holding, and Transfer (CHT) : System designed to collect both sewage and greywater while in port to offload to shore receiving facilities and to discharge both sewage and greywater over board while operating beyond 3 N m from shore. Compensated Fuel Ballast (CFB) : CFB systems are configured as a series of fuel tanks that automatically draw in seawater to replace fuel as it is consumed. This process stabilizes the vessel by using the weight of the seawater to compensate for the mass of ballast lost through fuel consumption. At NBSD, discharge of compensating water pierside while conducting in port refueling operations is authorized. There is no 1-4 requirement for a comp water barge. Notification of planned compensating water discharge shall be made to NBSD Port Operations dispatch at (619) 556- 1433 no later than 48 hours in advance of the planned discharge start time. Corrosiv es: Materials, including solids, which are acids or bases, or produce acidic or alkaline solutions. Dirty Ballast Water : Ballast water, m ust be offloaded outside of 12 N m from shore or transferred to shore facilities for processing. Discharge : Term associated with a release to surface waters or to the sanitary sewer system . This includes any substance , material , or waste that is not speci fically authorized for discharge by the NBSD NPDES or IU DP. Drop Cloth: Any suitable impervious material that may be used for minimizing the quantity of pollutants released to the environment from activities that include, but are not limited to, painting, grinding , and chipping. Examples of acceptable drop cloths are canvas tarps, plastic (6mm in thickness at a minimum), and cardboard. \"Butcher\" paper is not allowed. Electronic Device: Any item with electronic components such as transistors, semiconduct ors, etc. All Government surplus property including electronic devices must be managed through DLA Disposition Services San Diego (DRMO). Electronic devices are not to be disposed of in the trash or scrap metal bins. Free Liquids : Any liquid that becomes separated from the solid portion of a substance under ambient temperature and pressure. Gas Turbine Water Wash : Gas turbine water wash is generated within 12 N m and varies by the type of gas turbine and the amount of time it i s operated. Because the drain collecting system is limited in size, d ischarges may occur within 12 N m. On most Navy and M ilitary Sealift Command (MSC) gas turbine ships, gas turbine water wash is collected in a dedicated collection tank and is not discharg ed overboard within 12 N m. On ships without a dedicated collection tank, this discharge is released as a component of deck runoff, well deck discharges, or bilge water, or transferred to shore facilities for processing. Greywater: Domestic wastewater from sinks, baths, and kitchen appliances. Hazardous Material (HM): A ny material that may pose a real hazard to human health or the environment due to quantity, concentration, or physical or chemical characteristics . HMs include the following categories : Flammable, Combustible s, Corrosive s, Oxidizers , Aerosols , and Compressed Gases . 1-5 Hazardous Waste (HW): Any waste with properties that make it potentially dangerous or harmful to human health or the environment. Can be liquids, solids, contained gases, by-products of processes, or discarded used and unused HM. Incompat ible: The commingling o f HM that may result in fire, heat, pressure, explosion, or violent reaction. Ignitable : Any substance having a flash point less than 140\u00b0 F or the capability of spontaneously bursting into flames (Includes Oxidizers ). Industrial User Discharge Permit (IUDP ): Any discharger of industrial wastes into the Metropolitan sewerage system is required to obtain a permit from the City of San Diego IUDP . Marine Pollution Control Device ( MPCD ): Any equipment or management practice designed to treat, retain or control discharges of a vessel . National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES ) Permit : A federal permit system that regulates the discharge of storm water and wastewater to waters of the State . NBSD is currently regulated by a NPDES permit . Pharmaceutical s: Termed also as medicine or medication, can be loosely defined as any chemical substance intended for use in the medical diagnosis , cure, treatment , or prevention of disease . A pharmaceutical may be either over the counter items, (aspirin, ointments, etc.) or any prescription medication. Photographic Laboratory Drains : This is the intermittent discharge from processing photographic film. Process liquid from these activities includes used film processing chemical developers, fixer -bath solutions and film rinse water. Photographic laboratory process liquid may be generated within and beyond 12 N m from shore, although cur rent practice is to collect and hol d onboard within 12 N m. Reactiv e: A s ubstance, unstable under normal conditions , that can cause explosions, toxic fumes, gases , or vapors when heated, compressed, or mixed with water. Release : An unplanned discharge of hazardous substance (HS) to the environment. Reportable Quantity (RQ): The volume of a released substance that exceeds established federal reporting levels. Sewage (Black water) : Wastewater containing fecal matter and urine. Scrap Metal : Includes metal parts, metal working s, shaving, turnings, used containers (not containing any HW/HM residues ) or debris. Scrap metal does not include fine metal powders , electronic equipment or components . 1-6 Spill : A release of contaminated and/or HM into the environment. Toxicity : The degree to which a substance (a toxin or poison) can harm humans or the environment Uniform National Discharge Standard (UNDS ): Legislation passed by Congress amending the Clean Water Act to control discharges that are incidental to the normal operation of vessels of the Armed Forces. Volatile Organic Compound (VOC ): The component of a paint, solvent, adhesive, or other similar substance t hat evaporates into the surrounding environment with the potential to cause or contribute to air pollution. _________________________________ SECTION 2 ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT & COMPLIANCE (This page left blank intentionally) 2-1 ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT & COMPLIANCE ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT AND COMPLIANCE WATER QUALITY This se ction focuses on National Pollut ant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) Permit requirements and Uniform National Discharge Standards (UNDS) regulations for forces afloat . The section should help define what the expectations are o f the fleet sailor working over-the-side and how best to implement BMPs to provide maximum protection to the bay . This section will also i nclude discharges prohibited at NBSD . UNDS DISCHARGES \\UNDS regulates Armed Forces vessel discharges during operati ons in inland waters or within 12 nautical miles ( Nm) of shore. UNDS , as described in the Navy Region Southwest Port Environmental Manual (April 2018, Section 4.1, page 25) is as follows: All vessels must be aware that the UNDS is a regulatory program under the Clean Water Act, a Federal Law . These requirements provide a single set of discharge standards nationwide out to 12 Nm for incidental discharges occurring from the normal operation of vessels of the Armed Forces . UNDS supersedes any standard currently in place for a state or territory. Failure to comply with the UNDS requirements could result in enforcement actions, such as penalties and fines, issued by the USCG or a State. If a vessel has an UNDS controlled discharge that fails to co mply with these standards, the vessel designated Person In Charge (PIC) must, within 5 days of becoming aware of the non -compliance, send a non- compliance report (Navy message) to the Navy Regional Environmental Coordinator (REC) office, the vessel's TYCOM and Fleet Commander, or respective commander for non- commissioned vessels. The report format can be found on the Afloat Compliance Website, link is provided below. If any vessel is contacted by an enforcement authority regarding UNDS records or non- comp liance , direct them to the Navy REC office. Illustration of some of the discharge types subject to UNDS regulations. 2-2 For further information on the discharges covered, reporting, record keeping , and notification requirements should a violation occur, and responsibilities of the PIC (normally the Commanding Officer), please view the UNDS tab on the Afloat Compliance Website located at : https://eims3.sscno.nmci.navy.mil/afloat/ . Please view Appendix B for a list of UNDS monitored and controlled discharges at NBSD. For UNDS discharge clarification and/or approval, Ship's force must consult with the Navy on Scene Coordinator (NOSC), 619- 556-6232 (office), 619- 954-3147 (cell). 1. Enforcement Authority The enforcement authority should contact the Navy or DoD Regional Environmental Coordinator (REC) office directly for UNDS information. 2. Vessel (your unit) If the enforcement authority contacts you requesting UNDS information, the request should be directed up the chain -of-command and to the responsible Navy or DoD REC. 3. Navy REC The Navy REC office should contact the responsible TYCOM or Ship POC. 4. TYCOM/Craft/Boat POC The TYCOM or Ship POC will contact the UNDS Person -In- Charge (PIC). 5. Vessel PIC The PIC will then provide the requested information to the Navy REC. 6. Navy REC The enforcement authority should contact the Navy or DoD REC office directly for UNDS information. Communication Chain, In the event that an Enforcement Authority requests UNDS information. 2-3 PROHIBITED DISCHARGES NBSD water quality (NPDES) requirements prohibit substances from the nonexclusive list below from being discharged to San Diego Bay . NBSD water quality ( IUDP ) requirements also prohibit the following from being discharged to the sanitary sewer (ship's CHT) system without prior approval from the NBSD Environmental Office. Exceptions include substances otherwise allowed by UNDS and sewage. AFFF Any discharge that causes or contributes to a violation of water quality standards aside from authorized UNDS discharges Clarified water from oil/water separator Blasting materials Dirty Ballast Water Fiberglass dust Fuel leaks and spills HS HW Hydraulic oil leaks and spills Hydro -blast water MW Bilge water Paint chips, spills, and over -spray spills Saltbox water Ship repair and maintenance activity debris Steam cleaning water Swept materials Tank cleaning water from tank cleaning to remove sludge and/or dirt Trash, miscellaneous refuse, and rubbish Water contaminated with abrasive blast materials, paint, oils, fuels, lubricants, solvents, other petroleum , or any discharge above industrial wastewater discharge standards UNDS discharge s that are not applicable to NBSD For questions regarding these or other discharges to the bay or sewer system please contact the NBSD Environmental Office at 619-556-1537. 2-4 SHIP SEWAGE SPILLS Overboard discharge of sewage is prohibited unless necessary to prevent loss of life, personal injury, or severe damage to property or vessel . For spills or leaks from CHT risers or discharges into the bay, ship's force is required to make the following notifications : GREYWATER SPILLS Vessel g reywater discharge at NBSD is prohibited, unless necessary to prevent loss of life, personal injury, or severe damage to property or vessel . No matter the cause, any discharge, regardless of the quantity , must be reported to the NAVFAC Duty Desk at 619-556-7349 and NOSC at 619 -556-6232 (office), 619 -954-3147 (cell) . HAZARDOUS WASTE & MATERIALS In accordance with OPNAV M -5090.1, ships shall transfer used or excess HM to a shore activity for determination of disposition . If the shore activity determines that used or excess HM has no further use, it will declare the material to be waste and process in accordance with r egulatory requirements governing generation of HW , if applicable . Under no circumstance will a Navy vessel be listed as a \"generating site\" by a shore facility or contractor when applying for Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) HW generator identification numbers . Container Selection . Ensure containers are compatible with material contained, corrosives, flammables, etc. Cal OES 1 -800-852-7550 (document control# and provide to NAVFAC Duty Desk) NBSD CDO at 619 -247-8897 NAVFAC Duty Desk at 619 -556-7349 During normal working hours, the NBSD Environmental Office at 619 -556-1537.

MEDICAL WASTE CATEGORIES Wastes generated from diagnosis, research, treatment, immunizations, production or testing of biological products containing infectious agents are normally classified as MW. The four categories of MW are as follows: 1. Medical Solid Waste (MSW) . MSW incl udes but is not limited to empty specimen containers, bandages, dressings, dried blood, non- infectious surgical gloves, unused IV tubing, non- contaminated broken glassware, and other materials that are not classified as biohazards. If you are uncertain if you have MSW , please contact the NBSD Environmental office at 619-556-1537. Unused medical solid waste should be managed as regular trash and disposed of in the appropriate dumpster. All MSW must be double bagged before being placed in the trash. The bags DO NOT require any labeling or marking. 2. Biological H azardous Waste (BHW) . Most BHW falls into one of the following categories : Laboratory waste, pathogens, used specimen stocks or cultures, infectious agents, vaccines, non- sterilized culture dishes or materials that may contain infectious substances and may pose a significant threat to human health. 2-13 Blood and body fluids, containers contaminated with blood or body fluid elements that have separated from the solid portion of the waste under normal temperature. Tissues & medical/surgical type items contaminated with or that once contained chemotherapeutic agents. BHW must be staged for pier-side collection by the MW contractor at t he times listed in the section titled MEDICAL WASTE TURN IN & DISPOSAL . BHW shall never be discarded in the trash. All BHW must be accumulated, managed, and disposed of in certified red bags . All BHW bags shall be closed to prevent any leakage or expulsion of solid or liquid waste during storage, handling , or transportation . Each bag shall be clearly labeled with the bag contents . 3. Sharps Waste. Sharps are devices having rigid edges or corners used in medical or dental practices that are c apable of cutting or piercing. Examples include hypodermic needles, syringes with needles, blades, lancets , or broken glassware contaminated with BHW . Unused sharps contained in the original packaging can be returned to the GRP Used/contaminated sharps wastes must be accumulated in leak proof, rigid, puncture- resistant containers which, when sealed, cannot be easily reopened. Sharps are not to be managed in plastic bags. A rigid container is required. As with BHW , used sharps waste is not authorized to be placed into the trash and must be managed and disposed of as BHW . All sharps containers must have the Generator's Label when first placed into use. This includes Name, Address and Phone Number . 4. Pharmaceutical /Waste Pharmaceuticals. A pharmaceutical is any over-the- counter or prescription drug used for medical treatment. Any unused , expired less than a year , or extendible shelf life pharmaceutical from a ship may be managed as outlined below . Provide to another navy command, either afloat or ashore for usage or distribution , or return to the manufacturer through either: o A Reverse Distribution Program ( RDP ). o A Guaranteed Return Program ( GRP ). The disposal of unused pharmaceuticals as MW should be the ship 's last option. Those pharmaceuticals expired beyond a year or not redistribut able as stated above must be classified and managed as a waste. Th ese include: California regulated (non- RCRA ) Waste Pharmaceuticals Waste Pharmaceuticals Only non- RCRA pharmaceuticals may be turned in for disposal during normal scheduled pier-side pick-up times . Non-RCRA, California regulated w aste pharmaceuticals must be placed in clear plastic bags and identified with the ships name, address, and telephone number prior to pick up. The bag s shall also be labeled \" Waste Pharmaceuticals- Incinerate Only\". RCRA WASTE PHARMACEUTICALS The EPA has classified some waste pharmaceuticals as HW since their characteristics pose a specific harm to human health or the environment . These include iodine and alcohols or other medicinal products. The following are common listed pharmaceuticals used in military treatment facilities that cannot be turn ed-in and must be managed as HW through the NAVFAC HW services contract (619-556-9600 /01). (Appendix A contains a more extensive, non- inclusive, list of RCRA waste pharmaceuticals and associated product characteristics.) Common P -Listed Pharmaceuticals Common U -Listed at concentrations < 0.3% Do Not Flush Pharmaceuticals Down a Toilet! 2-15 PHARMACEUTICAL & PERSONAL CARE PRODUCTS (PPCP ) Recent environmental laws require PPCPs to be managed similar to pharmaceuticals (e.g., either as HW or MW depending on the products hazard characteristics ). Personal care products include any products used for personal health or cosmetic reasons. Sunscreen, cosmetics, fragrances, vitamins, supplements and any medicated personal use products are included. Some examples i nclude aftershave, cologne, perfume and antibacterial soaps, which contain alcohol . Due to alcohol content their flash point may make these items ignitable RCRA wastes. This also applies to some of the materials below. Antihistamines are an example of non -RCRA MW pharmaceuticals. PPCPs include, but are not limited to following: Aftershave Antibacterial soap Antibiotics Anti-fungal products Antihistamines Antiperspirant deodorant Antiseptics such as iodine, betadine and alcohol based hand wipes Aspirin, acetaminophen and ibuprofen Blood pressure medications Dandruff shampoo Decongestants Eyeliner Hair styling gel Lotion containing vitamins Nail polish and remover Nicotine patches Pain Medications Products that contain lidocaine Psoriasis and eczema topical treatments Empty containers that held PPCPs may be placed into pier-side trash bins if they never contained a n EPA P-listed material or waste. (See RCRA Pharms list , Appendix A, or contact NBSD Environmental for assistance, 619-556-1537) MEDICAL WASTE TURN IN & DISPOSAL MW must be staged separately from used HM in a secure or designated location (separation is as simple as storing the MW on its own pallet). Shipboard medical and dental waste will be collected pier-side Tuesday and Friday per the following schedule: MEDICAL WASTE PIER-SIDE PICK-UP SCHEDULE PIER TUE/FRI XXXX PIER TUE/FRI XXXX PIER TUE/FRI 1 0700 - 0725 5 0900 0925 - 1055 13 1330 - 1355 (This page left blank intentionally) SECTION 3 VESSEL MAINTENANCE & PRESERVATION (This page left blank intentionally) 3-1 VESSEL MAINTENANCE AND PRESERVATION VESSEL MAINTENANCE AND PRESERVATION The BMPs listed in this guide must be implemented by ship's forces. Approval to use alternative BMPs may be granted by the NBSD Environmental Office if it can be demonstrated that the alternative BMPs will provide an equivalent level of environmental protection GRINDING , SANDING , CHIPPING , WELDING & SURFACE PREPARATION Work shall be discontinued during high wind or rain. The area scheduled for work should not exceed 10 ft. x 10 ft. at any given time. Where work has the potential to discharge particulates into the bay, use shrouding, tarps, or other effective methods on vertical or horizontal surfaces , near or on the skin of the ship, maximizing the capture of dust, paint chips, metal fragments, etc. Work required on grating or other pervious surfaces found aboard ship must have a drop cloth or equivalent substitute placed underneath the work surface. When hydraulic man- lifts are used, canvas covers plastic , or equivalent durable material (at least 6 mm thick ) must be used to cover the bottom portion of the man- lift and must not extend vertically beyond the kick plate. Work areas must be swept or vacuumed thoroughly (no visible indications of debris) upon the completion of each job, or at a minimum at the end of each work shift. PAINTING Unsheltered painting shall be discontinued during high wind or rain. When over -the-side painting is scheduled using camels, floating platforms, or equivalent equipment, drop cloths are to be placed on the deck of the equipment to capture paint droplets or spills. In addition, when practical, a covered float should be placed under the vertical surfaces where over -the-side work is planned. 3-2 At a mini mum , painting operations conducted from a floating platform must have the bottom tier covered with a drop cloth. The drop cloth shall be secured i n such a manner as to render it immobile. Paint/Coating Requirements. Ship's company personnel shall consult the Ship' s Hazardous Material List (SHML) for paints authorized for use onboard ship. In addition, the following rules apply : 1) VOC limit for Marine Coatings (Paints) is 340 grams/liter or 2.8 lbs. /gl. 2) Thinning of coatings with solvents is prohibited. 3) All paint cans and solvent container s must be kept closed or covered when not in use. 4) Rags used for solvent wipe cleanup must be placed in leak and vapor proof plastic bags or containers when not in use or stored for proper disposal. 5) Paint s/coatings obtained overseas are not authorized for use in California ports. 6) Safety Data Sheet s (SDSs ) must be kept on file for all HM . ADHESIVES VOC limits for adhesive coatings: Contact the NBSD Environmental Office if you have questions about VOC content. All adhesive containers must be kept closed or covered when not in use. Rags used for cleanup must be placed in leak and vapor proof plastic bags or containers when not in use or stored for proper disposal. Adhesives obtained overseas are not authorized for use in California ports. Ship's company is prohibited from establ ishing an adhesives application station pier-side. NBSD Environmental Office must evaluate all adhesives work evolutions prior to use o n a pier . 3-3 SHIP FRESH WATER WASH DOWNS Fresh water wash downs are authorized to address salt buildup and operations outlined in UNDS. Fresh water wash down of ship flight decks may not be conducted due to environmental concerns from residual petroleum products. Prior to a fresh water wash down, all loose debris must be removed and the surface must be cleaned and swept . Under no circumstances shall any debris , oils/grease, or other contaminants be washed and/ or swept ov er the side of the ship. The u se of detergents to clean and remove oil, grease, grime, etc., as part of a wash down is prohibited. The use of pressure washer for wash down is also prohibited. Wash down w ater discharged to the bay must not show any evidence of sheen, suspended particulates, cloudiness and/or discoloration. Discharge d water must remain clear ; a visible sheen on receiving waters must be reported. For approval and/or clarification, Ship's force must consult with the NOSC, 619 -556- 6232 (office), 619- 954-3147 (cell). WEIGHT TESTING WATER DISCHARGES The discharge of weight testing water into San Diego Bay is authorized by the NBSD Environmental Office, Water Quality Group , on a case -by-case basis. Follow the steps below to obtain approval to perform weight testing. Step 1. Contact and notify the NBSD Environmental Office, Water Quality Group (619- 556-1537). The Water Quality Group personnel will discuss about the matter and send an electronic copy of the Weight Test BMP Plan for review. Step 2. Send an email to NBSD Environmental Office, Water Quality Group personnel with the following information and document to cniswenvnbsandiego@navy.mil: 3-4 If possible, the discharging vessel must make the notification to the NBSD Environmental Office as early as practical . A 72-hour advance notification is preferred. GENERAL PIER HOUSEKEEPING Good housekeeping is an important BMP and consists of routine sweeping , vacuuming, and clean- up of work areas that , at a minimum , must be completed at the end of each work shift . HM/W spills, such as paints and oils, shall be immediately cleaned up. Senior Officer Present Afloat (SOPA) Pier Environmental Petty officers shall conduct pier walk -throughs at least once a week to monitor cleanliness , spills or leaking equipment and abandoned wastes or other items. Ship's company is not to stage HW or MW on the piers more than thirty minutes in advance of a pier -side pickup. The staged HW /MW must be manned until pick -up time. Step 3. Receive an approval email from NBSD Environmental Office, Water Quality Group. A. Specifics : (1) Pier and Ship where test will be performed? (2) Date and proposed time of discharge? (3) What is the estimated volume of discharge? (4) Equipment used for the testing and where it will be located (i.e. crane on the ship or pier)? (5) Who will be performing the test and managing the discharge? What is their contact information? (6) From where the water will be drawn (i.e. fire main system on ship, bay water, etc.)? (7) How bags will be obtained? (8) Verification that bags were cleaned and inspected according to industry standard and are free of contaminants/pollutants? B. Submit the Water Weights Inspection Certificate to us (NBSD Environmental), certifying that the bag is clean. 3-5 Ships requiring HM storage on the piers for greater than 24 hours must place liquid materials in secondary containment sufficient t o contain any spills. All equipment staged on the pier, such as Baker tanks, generators, re- circulating pumps etc., must be placed in secondary containment sufficient to contain spills. Vehicles used solely for transportation and/or loading and unloading are not required to have secondary containment when not in use, unless they are leaking fluids . PIER-SIDE PAINTING Painting operations conducted from piers utilizing man lifts shall use non- porous covers designed to prevent the spillage or discharge of paints into the bay. If covers are not available, the man lift may be covered or wrapped with similar materials (i.e., plastic, shrink -wrap) to prevent the release of paint into the environment. Paper is not to be used to wrap the basket or used as a drop cloth. Plastic must be a minimum of 6 mm in thickness. Ship's force is prohibited from painting equipment, vehicles , etc., on piers. Such evolutions require a permit from the San Diego APCD . If circumstances require ships force to paint items on the pier, the evolution must be cleared through the NBSD Environmental Office. SHIPS' FORCES RECORDKEEPING In accordance with OPNAV M -5090.1 all painting evolutions, whether inside the ship or on the outer hull, require USAGE LOGS be maintained and retained onsite for three years . These logs must include : Date Coating/Prep Agent/Cleaner Used Product Manufacturer Quantities (pint, qt., gal., oz.) : Qty. Issued/Qty. Used Volatile Organic Compound in grams/liter or lbs ./gal Common Product Name (e.g. Haze Gray, thinner) HICSWIN should be used to track this information. If HICSWIN training is needed, contact your CHRIMP tech. If HICSWIN is not available, an E xcel usage log may be used. If you require an E xcel usage log, contact NBSD's Air Program Manager at 619- 556-0966. Records shall be provided to NBSD's Air Program Manager by the 10th day of the month for the previous month, or prior to departure. 3-6 LEAKING VEHICLES When vehicles, forklifts , etc., under the cognizance of the ship are leaking fluids (i.e. oil, antifreeze, etc.) , the ship must capture the fluids using a drip pan or similar device. Such devices containing leaked fluids (i.e. oil, oil with water, antifreeze, etc.) must be emptie d and cleaned on a daily basis or prior to any rainy days. Spill/leak residual s resulting from leaking vehicles shall be immediately cleaned up using absorbents, rags, etc. Materials/ wastes generated from leaking vehicles shall be treated as HW and disposed of accordingly. The ship will take measures to ensure the vehicle is scheduled for repairs t hat stop the leak. TRASH & RECYCLING While black scrap metal bins are readily available on the piers, if you need to dispose of cardboard, please contact the Waste Management Contract Specialist at 619-556-0513/6732 to request a drag on. Wood and wooden pallets should be neatly stacked outside of the head of the pier . Please contact Waterfront Operations to coordinate pick -up at 619- 556-3147/8006.

Freshwater Lay -up: The potable water that is discharged from the seawater cooling system while the vessel is in port and t he cooling system is in lay -up mode (a standby mode where seawater in the system is replaced with potable water for corrosion protection). Mine Countermeasures Equipment Lubrication: The constituents released into the surrounding seawater by erosion or dissolution from lubricated mine countermeasures equipment when the equipment is deployed and towed. Portable Damage Control Drain Pump Discharge : The seawater pumped through the portable damage control drain pump and discharged overboard during testing, maintenance, and training activities. Refrigeration and Air Conditioning Condensate : The drainage of condensed moisture from air conditioning units, refrigerators, freezers, and refrigerated spaces. Rudder Bearing Lubrication: The oil or grease released by the erosion or dissolution from lubricated bearings that support the rudder and allow it to turn freely. Steam Condensate : The condensed steam discharged from a vessel in port, where the steam originates from port facilities. Stern Tube Seals and Unde rwater Bearing Lubrication: The seawater pumped through stern tube seals and underwater bearings to lubricate and cool them during normal operation. Controlled discharges applicable at NBS D: Chain Locker Effluent: The accumulated precipitation and seawater that is emptied from the compartment used to store the vessel's anchor chain. The small amount of water that is washed into the chain locker eventually drains through the bottom grating and into the sump where it can come into c ontact with paint chips, rust, grease, and sacrificial zinc anodes. Chain locker effluent is discharged when the chain locker sump is emptied directly overboard. Clean Ballast : Either seawater or freshwater that is transferred into and out of dedicated t anks to adjust a surface ship's draft and to improve stability under various operating conditions. The discharge is generated when the ballast is no longer required and the tanks are partially or completely emptied. Compensat ing Fuel Ballast : Seawater that is introduced into fuel tanks to maintain the stability of a vessel by compensating for the weight of the expended fuel that is consumed. During refueling, this seawater is displaced overboard. Deck Runoff : Water runoff from precipitation, freshwater wash -downs , and seawater that falls on the exposed decks of a vessel . Distillation and Reverse Osmosis (RO) Brine: The concentrated seawater (i.e., brine) produced as a byproduct of the process used to generate freshwater from seawater in distilling and RO equipment and machinery. The brine primarily consists of seawater, but can also contain materials from these processes, such as nutrients and anti -scaling treatment chemicals as well as some metals, including copper and zinc. Elevator Pi t Effluent: The liquid that accumulates in, and is discharged from, the sumps of elevator wells on vessels. Firemain Systems: Seawater distributed for firefighting and other services aboard ships. Discharges of firemain water from normal operations occur during firemain testing, maintenance and training activities, anchor chain wash -down, and cooling of auxiliary machinery. Gas Turbine Water Wash: The water released from washing shipboard gas turbine components. Does not include water wash cleaning of aircraft gas turbine engines aboard ship. Non-Oily Machinery Wastewater : The combined wastewater from the operation of distilling plants, water chillers, valve packings, water piping, low and high-pressure air compressors, and propulsion engine jacket coolers. Photographic Laboratory Drains: Laboratory wastewater resulting from the processing of photographic film. The wastewater results from the processing of color, black and white, and X -ray film. Seawater Cooling Overboard Discharge : The discharge of seawater from dedicated piping system s that provide non- contact cooling water for other vessel systems. Seawater Piping Biofouling Prevention: Seawater containing additives used to prevent the growth and attachment of biofouling organisms in dedicated seawater systems on vessels. Small Boat Engine Wet Exhaust : The seawater that is mixed and discharged with small boat propulsion engine exhaust to cool the exhaust and quiet the engine. Underwater Ship Husbandry : Discharge from the grooming, maintenance, and repair of hulls and hull appendages performed while a vessel is waterborne. Underwater ship husbandry includes hull cleaning, fiberglass repair, welding, sonar dome repair, non- destructive testing, masker belt repairs, and painting operations. Welldeck Discharges: Discharges that include the water that accumulates from seawater flooding of the docking (i.e., welldeck) of an amphibious support vessel used to transport, load, and unload amphibious vehicles, and from maintenance and freshwater washings of the welldeck and equipment and vessels stored in the welldeck.

Includes: food scraps table refuse galley refuse food wrappers or packaging materials (e.g., plastic, cardboard) from stores, galleys, mess areas, and berthing areas plastic pucks (ships), plastic logs (submarines) Trash is refuse that neither contains nor is visually contaminated with regulated garbage. Trash is not regulated by USDA APHIS and is therefore unrestricted. For example: Unrestricted Restricted * If transit is between CONUS/Alaska/Canada and Hawaii/U.S. territories/possessions, or between Hawaii, U.S. territories, and U.S. possessions, only fresh fruits and vegetable (FF&V) and regulated garbage must be disposed of per USDA APHIS regulations; meat and other animal materials are exempt. EXAMPLE APPLICATIONS OF USDA APHIS RG REGULATIONS FOR U.S. NAVY VESSELS Vessel returns from Japan and stops in Hawaii for 5 days, then heads to San Diego: Japan to San Diego via Hawaii a. RG process in Hawaii - all foreign plant/animal food stores and regulated garbage b. RG process in San Diego - only FF&V and regulated garbage Unrestricted: Trash that only contains empty soda cans Trash that contains newspapers and magazines Restricted: Trash that contains empty cardboard milk carton, sandwich, or fruit -All of it is regulated garbage due to commingling D-2 Vessel returns from foreign port and stops in Guam for 5 days, then heads to Hawaii : Foreign Port to Hawaii via Guam a. RG process in Guam - all foreign plant/animal food stores and regulated garbage b. RG process in Hawaii - only FF&V and regulated garbage Vessel returns from foreign port and stops in first U.S. port for less than 24 hours , then heads to Norfolk: Foreign Port to Norfolk v ia other U.S. Port a. RG process in first U.S. port - all foreign plant/animal food stores and regulated garbage b. RG process in Norfolk? Yes, 24hour rule was not completed in first U.S. port and must be performed in Norfolk. Avoid unnecessary costs of repeating RG process at consecutive CONUS port visits by ensuring ship schedule allows completion of RG process at the first CONUS port. REGULATED GARBAGE MANAGEMENT /OFFLOAD BEST PRACTICES Prior to U.S. port arrival : a. Vessel orders a sufficient number of clear, 3 mil (0.003 inch) thick plastic bags (below), zip ties or duct tape, and RG bag labels (see step e) : I. 30 gal, 30\" x 30\", NSN 4814 (2 box minimum order) Vessel orders a sufficient number of shore- side RG containers prior to U.S. arrival. Consider : ANY VESSEL THAT TRIGGERS THE USDA APHIS RG REQUIREMENTS BY VISITING PORTS OUTSIDE OF CONUS, ALASKA , AND CANADA WITHIN THE PREVIOUS TWO YEARS (FOREIGN PORTS ) OR PREVIOUS ONE YEAR (PORTS IN HAWAII , U.S. TERRITORIES , OR U.S. POSSESSIONS ), WILL HAVE RG FOR OFFLOAD UPON RETURN TO THE FIRST U.S. PORT AND GENERATE /OFFLOAD REGULATED GARBAGE THROUGH THE 24HOUR RULE, EVEN IF THE VESSEL ONLY RECEIVED U.S. FOOD STORES WHILE DEPLOYED . THIS IS TO MITIGATE THE RISK POSED BY UNDOCUMENTED (E.G., PERSONAL ) PURCHASES OF FOREIGN FOODS . D-3 I. Size and weight restrictions of RG containers available at the particular port (e.g., a container of only plastic pucks could exceed the weight limit) II. Volume s of RG coming from the food service and engineering (plastic pucks and other wastes that have been commingled with RG) departments. c. After pulper(s) and plastic waste processor(s) have been shut down at the end of deployment, keep trash (see definition above) separate from RG and clearly labeled as \"NOT Regulated Garbage.\" d. Send All Hands message (template at end of this document). e. All RG must be put in clear plastic bags that are at least 3 mil thick and intact/leak proof. Bags must be securely closed (e.g., twisted shut and taped, ziptied) and labeled as \"Regulated Garbage\" using the materials below. I. Zip ties, NSN or similar II. 7690 01676 7481, or clear ly labeled using permanent marker or similar Upon arrival at first U.S. port , at the direction of the USDA APHIS or U.S. CBP inspector, or person designated by USDA APHIS/U .S. CBP, vessel offloads all properly bagged RG into shore- side RG container. a. DO . . . I. Contain RG in leak proof, 3 mil thick plastic bags. II. Place RG only in the shore- side RG container III. Keep RG container doors closed except when pl acing RG into the container. IV. Report any RG spill to the proper organization. Refer to the Port Environmental Manual (PEM). b. DON'T . . . I. Place any loose waste or open/leaky bags in the RG container. The RG hauler can refuse to pick up the container until all RG has been properly bagged and RG container is cleaned (REQUIRES DUMPSTER DIVING) . II. Place non RG (e.g. ind ustrial waste, HM/W ) into the RG container. D-4 III. Place RG bags on the ground next to or on top of the RG container. IV. Overfill RG container. Container doors should be completely closeable . 24hour rule (per NAVSUP Publication 486) : a. If there are no FF&V or foreign stores aboard the vessel, and all regulated garbage has been offloaded, all galley/scullery garbage produced during the first 24 hours in port will be handled and disposed of as RG. After the first 24 hours, food service garbage produced onboard is not regulated (unrestricted trash) and no further action is required. NOTE : Vessels cannot hold all waste for 24 hours after arrival and then discharge all as trash (unrestricted/domestic). NOTE: If the first U.S. port visit is less than 24 hours, the vessel must fulfill the 24 hour rule at the next U.S. port (requires shore -side RG container(s) at the second U.S. port). Subsequent visits to ports outside of CONUS, Alaska, and Canada will t rigger regulated garbage requirements again. WASTE MANAGEMENT RECOMMENDATIONS : a. Consume all foreign source stores and/or dispose of foreign stores and food wastes according to Naval Ships' Technical Manual Chapter 593. b. Keep materials (e.g., paper, cardboard, plastic waste) that are not associated with RG items separate and clearly label the stowage container(s) as non RG. c. The vessel may want to post a watch on the shore- side RG container(s) to prevent others from putting inappropriate waste in the RG container. Non compliant: Bag is not 3 mil, not securely closed. Compliant: All RG is in 3mil bags and securely closed. Non compliant: RG container is open, holds loose RG. Compliant: RG container is closed. D-5 PLEASE READ TH E ENTIRE FOLLOWING SECTION AS IT WILL SAVE YOU FROM RE SORTING TRASH REGULATED (FOREIGN ) GARBAGE SHIP ALL HANDS TEMPLATE We must follow USDA requirements when disposing of all food and food related wastes that contain fruits, vegetables, meat, or poultry, and other materials that have been associated with them (e.g., food wrappers/packaging, cardboard, PLASTIC PUCKS). This waste is Regulated Garbage (RG) (also referred to as Foreign Garbage) and must be disposed of as follows : Bagged in clear, 3 mil (0.003 inch) thick plastic bags. Bags not to exceed 35 pounds each. Bags must be intact (if ripped, place in another 3 mil thick bag) and secured with duct tape or zip ties. Identified as Regulated Garbage using \"Regulated Garbage\" labels (NSN TBD) or permanent marker. Only placed into the shore- side container labeled as Regulated Garbage. RG containers found holding loose or improperly bagged RG or non RG (industrial waste, HM/W ) will require dumpster diving to bring the RG container into compliance. If RG is found in a regular/domestic trash dumpster, the entire dumpster contents must be handled as Regulated Garbage, properly bagged, and put into an RG container. After all RG has been offloaded, the ship will operate under the 24 hour rule in which all garbage generated by the galley(s)/scullery(s) for the next 24 hours is managed as RG. After 24 hours, the ship will return to standard domestic trash procedures. NonRG (soda cans, water bottles, paper, etc. that have not been in contact with RG) must be disposed of as follows : Placed in any type of bag EXCEPT the clear, 3 mil thick bags used for RG. Clearly labeled as non RG. Offloaded to the regular/domestic tr ash dumpster or recycle bin. HM or containers that had HM in them will remain onboard and offload coordinated through Supply .
