These partnerships provided credible and timely influenza i nformation to the public by connecting the public to specially trained and trusted pharmacists , who are accessible healthcare professionals and a first resource for consumers. This partnership leveraged the vast potential of pharmacies, located throughou t the county, with the retail expertise to promote and publicize public health messages and vaccination with creative signage, coupons , and merchandise displays. These public -private collaborations extend ed the reach of the LHD , engage d and empower ed indiv iduals and families, and provide d vaccinations in traditional and nontraditional settings. The partnership between the PBCHD and Publix Super Markets was formed (February 2009) to increase awareness concerning ways to prevent and prepare for seasonal inf luenza by reaching the public, as customers, while they are doing their regular shopping at supermarkets and community pharmacies. The purpose was to reduce excess morbidity and mortality from flu, or from other contagious illnesses , by reminding people of simple public health measures and the importance of vaccination. Publix Super Markets agreed to disseminate Flu Ready Cards, created by the PBCHD, to more than 45 stores in the county. The partnership expanded in August 2009 in two significant ways. First, the PBCHD made additional collaborations with the Winn Dixie Super Market corporate leadership to expand the dissemination of Flu Ready Cards to pharmacy customers in their 25 stores. Second, the Walgreens pharmacies also agreed t o partner with the PBCHD and distribut e the Flu Ready Cards to all pharmacists in their 70 stores. The partnership also expanded beyond distribution of Flu Ready Cards to include dissemination of the newly released federal H1N1 influenza vaccine once the H1N1 pandemic was declared in June 2009. In August 2009 , an announcement was made that LHDs in Florida would be responsible for distributing the new H1N1 vaccine to providers. The PBCHD created a comprehensive and coordinated plan to vaccinate the target p opulation and then roll out the vaccine to the general population. This plan included recruiting pharmacists from retail venues and nurse -practitioners from the in -store retail health clinics, registering them into the Florida SHOTS vaccine registry , and having them sign a required memorandum of agreement (MOA) . The collaboration with corporate leadership in the nation's largest community pharmacy chains also served as the bridge to the pharmacies' in-store health clinics, a growing trend in the provision of healthcare. The in -store health clinics included Take Care Clinics inside Walgreens stores, Little Clinics in selected Publix Super Markets, and Minute Clinics inside CVS drug stores. These clinics, staffed by nurse -practitioners, could vaccinate young children, a first -tier target of the H1N1 vaccination campaign. These clinics can reach families without a medical home or relationships with private providers, another opportunity to bring influenza vaccination to those at -risk. Pharmacists in Florida are authorized to provide influenza vaccinations to adults age 18 and over. For this reason, the in -store clinics became early receivers of the H1N1 vaccine in efforts to best reach the target populations (children and pregnant women) , and the pharmacists bec ame part of the second release of vaccine. 3 Women are most often involved in the shopping for family and friends. They are also the central healthcare decision makers for children, parents , and family. The Keiser Family Foundation, Women and Health Care P rofile 2005, found that 80 percent of women shoulder the healthcare decision making for their families. Therefore, reaching female shoppers with credible public health messages and vaccination opportunities can greatly improve overall health. (Kaiser Famil y Foundati on, 2005). BACKGROUND This partnership was the first known outreach by the LHD with community pharmacies, in the drug store chains , and in supermarkets. In addition to the community pharmacies, the PBCHD initiated contact with the Palm Beach County (PBC) Pharmacy Association. This new partnership will continue for all -hazard s community preparedness and response , and is the first known collaboration with the PBCHD. The PBCHD leadership spoke at a monthly PBC Pharmacy Association meeting , provid ing an update on H1N1 activities. In order to strengthen the partnership, PBCDH invited the PBC Pharmacy Association l to the monthly Healthcare Emergency Response Coalition (HERC) meetings, attended by all 15 hospitals and pre -hospital partners (EMS leade rship from fire and rescue agencies). In addition, PBC Pharmacy Association leadership will be invited to participate in all public health trainings , tabletop exercises , and drills, bringing in pharmacists as a new partner in all -hazard s emergency preparedness and response. The partnerships made with the corporate leadership of community pharmacies (Walgreens and CVS) was initiated through the Adult Immunization Coalition, which meets twice each year and is attended by providers and comm unity agencies. The partnership began as a way to provide simple influenza readiness messages to the public. These messages included supplies for stockpiling , encouraging seasonal flu vaccine, hand washing , cough etiquette, and isolation when ill. By sum mer 2009, once the H1N1 activity had reached pandemic proportions and vaccine production was underway, the partnership was expanded to include vaccine distribution, antiviral placement and status, and patient surge collaboration, in addition to releasing the message to more pharmacies. METHODS Partner Formation The PBCHD e -mailed and called the Publix Super Market Inc. corporate pharmacy headquarters and spoke with both the integrated care manager ( pharmacy and in-store clinics) and the emergency preparedness director. In -person meetings were scheduled at the supermarket headquarters. A Flu Readiness Initiative Action Plan was proposed and agreed to by the supermarket chain using a small sample of Palm Beach County stores within a defined time perio d. This was then expanded to more than 45 stores within Palm Beach County once the H1N1 pandemic was declared. This approach (e -mail and telephone calls) was the method used to engage the pharmacy leadership at the Winn Dixie Super Market chain , as well. 4 PBCHD 's pandemic influenza coordinator met with Walgreens ' pharmacy supervisor at the County Adult Immunization Coalition meeting in August 2009. A private one -on-one meeting was set up following the coalition meeting \u2014the Flu Ready Initiative was proposed , and Walgreens agreed to participate. Walgreens invited PBCHD 's emergency preparedness coordinator and pandemic influenza coordinator to an internal staff meeting for all 70 store managers and pharmacy managers. This provided an opportunity for the LHD to survey the pharmacists on multiple flu-related topics and gain support for the Flu Ready Initiative. Other project stakeholders include d the following : Adult Immunization Coalition Meeting \u2014This meeting provided a venue for providers, chain drug store pharmacy supervisors, vaccine manufacturer representatives, LHD immunization services staff , and community service agencies to come together and discuss adult vaccination objectives and opportunities. The LHD's H1N1 leadership presented the vaccine distribution plan and the new Flu Ready Card program at the August 2009 meeting. The meeting promoted the sharing of information by vaccine representatives who then took the LHD's contact information to private -practice pediatricians and internists as they went from office to office. Palm Beach County Pharmacy Association \u2014Following initial contact by PBCHD, the pandemic influenza coordinator gave an update on H1N1 activities and the LHD's vaccine distribution plan to the PBC Pharmacy Association 's members at a monthly meeting in October . Flu Ready Cards and contact information were distributed. Florida Pharmacy Association \u2014PBCHD offered to assist with the expansion of the Flu Ready Card and pharmacy collaboration on a statewide basis. PBC Medical Society and HERC \u2014The HERC was a key stakeholder to distribute vaccine to healthcare workers, collaborate on hospital surge strategies, liaise with physicians on hospital staff, and distribute Flu Ready Cards to visitors and employees. The HERC holds monthly meetings for all 15 local hospital key emergency preparedness staff ( e.g., e mergency department , safety and infection control personnel), medical society representat ives, PBC Division of Emergency Management, and fire and r escue agencies. Each month, in addition to emergency preparedness and response topics, vaccine distribution and flu response strategies were discussed. Flu Ready Cards were provided in every hospital emergen cy department throughout the flu pandemic. Some hospitals added their logo s to the card and distributed the cards through emergency department s. The HERC assisted in creating links from the LHD to hospital pharmacy leadership for ease of vaccine distributi on. As a result of the LHD partnerships, the HERC has invited PBC Pharmacy Association representatives to participate in monthly HERC meetings, further strengthening the connection among hospitals, LHDs , physician providers , and pharmacists. The following factors were most important in facilitating the public -private partnership: Initiation and interest by PBCHD 's Office of Public Health Preparedness staff ; The urgency of the H1N1 influenza pandemic ; H1N1 Influenza vaccine accessibility through LHDs; Gran t funding for pandemic preparedness helping to create the Flu Ready Cards ; 5 LHD resources and infrastructure ( e.g., p ublic information and graphics, information technology , warehouse) ; LHD credibility as the prime resource for public health information in PBC ; Pharmacists as trusted, knowledgeable, and accessible healthcare providers and partners ; and Commitment by corporate leadership of supermarkets and chain drug stores that saw an opportunity to partner with organized public health . Barriers The barriers for this partnership were minimal and associated with overcoming corporate decision -making. The LHD worked with local pharmacy supervisors for the major national drug store chains. These supervisors had to review the Flu Ready Card disseminati on and H1N1 vaccine ordering decisions in conjunction with their corporate management. The pharmacies were motivated to be partners with PBCHD and found ways to overcome any corporate roadblocks. In turn, based on a close working relationship with Palm Bea ch County, the LHD served as a contact point for these drug store chains wanting similar contact people in other LHDs throughout the state. The variability from county to county was difficult for the corporate pharmacies to grasp, because variability was the opposite of the corporate standardization of policies and processes. Corporate decision -making procedures and systems were a barrier to signing the MOA to serve as a provider for the state Florida on the Florida SHOTS vaccine registry. Was the MOA to b e signed at a corporate level , state level , or local level by the national chain drug stores? The decision was made by the state and local health departments, in consultation with their legal professionals and others, that each pharmacy ch ain (i.e., Walgre ens, CVS, Wal -Mart) would electronically sign the universal provider agreement on the Florida SHOTS website in order for the LHD to release vaccine from its allocation. For the supermarkets, the LHD worked directly with pharmacy headquarters within the supermarket chains located in Florida and had fewer barriers for vaccine distribution , but somewhat less interest in flu prevention than the community pharmacies. The lesser interest may have been due to the fact that supermarkets ' primary mission involves food and food safety and to a lesser degree , interest in their public health role. This situation seems to be changing as more supermarkets dedicate space to pharmacies and health products. Funding was another major barrier. Without the initial pandemic influenza grant funding to the LHD (January -August 2009) and hiring a pandemic influenza coordinator, this collaboration would not have taken shape. The H1N1 federal funding that began in August 2009 allowed for this collaborative arrangement with pharmacies to continue. The unlikely continuation of federal funding and the lack of resources by the LHD are impeding the growt h of this partnership. Pharmacist authority was another barrier to providing vaccinations to the general population, especially to children. All 50 states allow pharmacists to administer vaccinations. This authority began in 1994 in Seattle. In 2009, Maine became the last state to grant such privileges. Some states require specific education or certification; some limit by types of vaccine; others limit by age of patient; some require a pharmacist to have a prescription from a physician before administering a vaccine; and some states limit the routes of administration . (Terrie, 2010) (Carpenter, 2009). 6 Florida aut horizes immunizing pharmacists, with proper certification, to administer influenza vaccinations to persons ages 18 and over. No other vaccination s are authorized and not to persons under age 18. This is a barrier to protecting the population from vaccine -preventable diseases, including Pneumococcal disease, Herpes Zoster (shingles), Hepatitis , and many other diseases, including childhood diseases. Pharmacists have the unique position to help identify persons who are in the target populations for certain vaccinations because they have access to medication profile s. One of the major objectives of the Department of Health and Human Services ' Healthy People 2010 Initiative , a nationwide program to increase health promotion and disease prevention services, is to decrease vaccine -preventable disease by increasing and improving access to vaccine services. The partnership with pharmacists, as accessible an d trained healthcare professionals, could greatly increase access to vaccinations. Challenges Many challenges associated with the H1N1 mass vaccination campaign were beyond the control of the state and local health departments. The federal government ori ginally promised to release the vaccine earlier and in greater quantities. The vaccine was slower to grow in egg culture , and smaller quantities arrived , which led to a lack of balance between supply and demand. As the cycle of disease spik ed and the publi c wanted the vaccine , vaccine was unavailable or scarce. When considerable vaccine was on hand, the public demand was gone. In addition, the disease increase d in the summer due to camp outbreaks and again in September , as children went back to school ; however, the vaccine was not delivered until late October/early November . The supermarket and drug store chains were most helpful in overcoming this challenge by keeping the prospect of available vaccine in front of the consumer by using creative signage vi sible from the street and in -store promotions. Below are some specific challenges PBCHD faced with the H1N1 vaccination plan: Vaccine Registry \u2014The Florida SHOTS vaccine registry was an integral element of the collaboration because all providers had to be recruited and registered to receive the vaccine. Therefore, challenges were associated with recruiting the correct contact persons to sign the provider agreement/MOA, order the vaccine , and serve as a resource for distribution and reordering. This challenge was overcome once the correct contact person was made for each community pharmacy. E -mails or calls were made regarding the type of vaccine formulation the LHD had in stock , and suggestions were made for ordering ( e.g., either th e Novartis or Sanofi Pasteur multi -dose vials). Logistics \u2014Some limitations existed in distributing information, particularly Flu Ready Cards , to every supermarket and pharmacy, and distribution varied by corporate entity. The drug store chains maintain ed local distribution sites , and the LHD was able to bring the Flu Ready Cards to one distribution site and then pharmacy managers picked up their Flu Ready Card allotment for each store. This logistical process was more difficult for the supermarket distrib ution. Flu Ready Cards had to be boxed with the supermarket store number and then brought to a distribution site outside the county for supermarket personnel to redistribute. Doing so took a great deal of LHD personnel to break apart the cards and re -sort them into individual store supplies. An alternative was to ship the cards to the home base of the supermarket chain for distribution. However, the LHD did not have the financial resources for postage to move the cartons of cards a great distance. An altern ative would have been to bring the Flu Ready Cards to the supermarket 7 warehouse in bulk format for their personnel to break apart and include in packages for local stores. This will be the procedure for the 2010 -2011 Flu Ready Cards. Pharmacy Privileges \u2014By Florida law, immunizing pharmacists have authority to provide influenza vaccinations to adults age 18 years and older. Initially, a major H1N1 vaccine target group was young children ; for this reason, with the legal restriction of age 18 for immunizing pharmacists, pharmacies were not in the first release of vaccine. Although pharmacists knew this, they remained eager to participate in the vaccination campaign. Policymakers should consider expanding the authority of pharmacists practicing in Florida so they have the power to dispense a wider variety of vaccines such as the pneumonia vaccine and reduc e the age restriction on dispensing vaccines to younger children . These actions are beyond the scope of the LHD . The in - store clinics ( i.e., Take Care in Walgreens, Minute Clinic in CVS, Little Clinics in Publix), staffed with nurse -practitioners, were in the first release for vaccine so they could vaccinate children while parents were purchasing supplies and receiving information and advice from the pharma cist. Vaccine Delays and Inconsistencies \u2014Vaccine delays and inconsistencies were limitation s for providers, pharmacists , and physicians. The vaccine did not arriv e until November , and there was a great rush for the early release of vaccine. By the time vaccine was plentiful in January and February, the public's interest had diminished. Administrative Fees and Insurance Coverage of H1N1 Vaccine by Pharmacists \u2014Insurance coverage for immunizing pharmacists is not standardized or uniform . Standardization requires state and federal intervention and is beyond the scope of this local collaborative. In addition, price competition existed among pharmacies , which led to public confusion. Achievements The public -private partnership with community pharmacies has extraordinary potential benefits. First, one significant underlying objective of any preparedness plan must be to engage, empower , and informs individuals, families , and communities. Managing any emergency involves communication , and this collaboration was based on sharing information across all levels and increasing the visibility of public health measures throughout the county. The partnership was convenient to the public because it provided a one -stop shop to reach people where they shop daily, provided ample and well-lit parking , accommodat ed evening and weekend hours, was accessibl e for those with disabilities, and allow ed people to stock up on supplies such as food staples, household items , and healthcare products at one time . This collaboration built on trusted relationships \u2014pharmacists are one of the most trusted professionals according to a recent Gallup poll (2009) \u2014and pharmacists are often the first resource for healthcare questions of th e public . The partnership expanded acce ss to the H1N1 vaccine to many residents including those who do not normally have a medical home. The PBCHD also brought a vaccination team into the supermarket when a pharmacy was not present or an immunizing pharmacist was not available. The El Bodegon Supermarket, the largest Hispanic supermarket chain in the country, distributed the Flu Ready Cards in Spanish to shoppers in three locations and allowed an LHD vaccination 8 team to set up a mini -clinic within the stores. On several afternoons before Christm as, in an area of the store located between the produce and bakery sections , more than 200 H1N1 vaccinations were provided to children and adults over four hour s. Shoppers appreciated this convenience . This collaboration was invaluable concerning the status of antiviral s and remedies for the temporary shortage of pediatric suspension Tamiflu . The ability to monitor and alter patient surge can be another benefit of partner ing with pharmacists. Pediatricians contacted the LHD regarding the status of antivirals to ask questions such as the following: W here could patients quickly locate life -saving medications, especially pediatric suspension of Tamiflu ? Where could pediatricians access antivirals for patients without health insurance ? The LHD's contacts with community pharmacies provided solutions to these pressing problems. Specific Benefits The LHD -pharmacy partnership resulted in the following benefits: More than 200,000 Flu Ready Cards were distributed in 250 community pharmacy locations and in -store health clinics from September through December 2009 . Relevant prevention and vaccination information was available to the public in a convenient location and from a trusted healthcare professional . Publix reprinted the Flu Ready Card and offered them in every store within their chain \u2014 more than 1,100 stores in five southeastern states . Pharmacists were engaged with the LHD's emergency preparedness leadership and learned of their interrelated role and mission . For the first time, t he LHD was abl e to speak to the local pharmacy association ; a second such meeting has been scheduled , and additional opportunities to partner are being explored . The LHD's vaccine distribution plan with pharmacies demonstrated to corporate entities (corporate -level chai n drug stores and supermarkets) the benefits of having a close working partnership at a local level. This local -level collaborat ion will be important during times of local emergency or disaster. Partners realized they had an opportunity to replicate this public -private collaboration with other local counties and also facilitate such relationship s statewide and nationwide . Innovation This was the first time the PBCHD collaborated with community pharmacies. RESULTS Impact /Measurement The public -private partnership involving supermarket and community pharmacies brought together existing partners in a new working relationship to improve individual and family preparedness and strengthen community resilience : The pharmacies gained greater access to information and community response planning and as a result , could provide better services and products to their customers, including access to the federal ly released H1N1 vaccine . The LHD gained a team of trusted professionals assisting with prevention and emergency response . The public became better informed and could develop action plans to handle local emergencies and events. 9 PBCHD shipped a lmost 40,000 doses of H1N1 vaccine to pharmacies and in-store health clinics in early December before the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) began a national vaccine shipment program to corporate chain pharmacies in late December. These 40,000 doses were approximately 10 percent of the PBCHD v accine allocation. Although PBCDH does not have statistics on vaccinations provided by these locations, vaccine re -orders were necessary to keep up with demand. The store clinics used for the first release of vaccine were in zip code areas with few pediatr icians and less access to medical care. The store clinics were selected to fill a perceived gap in access to vaccine. To measure the impact of the partnership, PBCDH created an assessment tool that was administered to pharmacy and store managers at Walgreens (in August and January) and to members of the PBC Pharmacy Association at its October meeting. More than 90 percent of pharmacists and 50 percent of store managers reported that customers asked them about influenza and ways to prevent catching the flu. Two questions asked in the January 2010 Assessment of Walgreens pharmacy managers helped measure the impact of this partnership: Did you find the Flu Ready Cards useful for sharing information with the public? Was the LHD useful to you? Of the 53 respondents (33 pharmacy managers and 20 store managers) , two-thirds found the Flu Ready Cards useful in talking to the public. Of those who identified themselves as pharmacy managers, 55 percent found the Flu Ready Cards useful (18/33). Of the 53 respondents in the Walgreens assessment, 57 percent reported that the LHD was useful to them during the pandemic, including 55 percent of pharmacy managers and 60 percent of store managers. Dissemination The PBCHD created and printed 400,000 copies of two Flu Ready Cards (2009), in English and Spanish. The cards were approximately 4 x 11 inches and easy for the pharmacist to use (a standar d Publix card stock that would fit into kiosks and display holders) and cost two cents per card. One side was devoted to supplies to purchase in advance of the flu in order to be ready for the rapid onset of illness , which encourage d people to be prepared at home with basic food and healthcare items. The reverse side of the card was devoted to Care for the Sick Person with Flu at Home as a patient surge mitigation strategy. Guidance from the CDC formed the basis of this card. ( See a ppendix ). In late summer, just as the pandemic preparedness grant funding ended, a second Flu Ready Card was printed (a green card to differentiate it from the first blue card) with a focus on vaccination. Specifically , the card defined the target groups for seasonal and H1N1 flu vaccine and provided the LHD's toll-free flu information hotline (888 ) 411-4FLU and website information. These cards were housed in cartons in the LHD's warehouse and delivered to one central warehouse for each major supermarket and national pharmacy chain ; the chains then distribute d the cards to individual store locations. 10 The Flu Ready Cards were offered in more than 250 retail outlets in Palm Beach County and available on various websites. These Flu Ready Cards were also taken to over 150 fairs, festivals, and outreach events . The cards were available to county employees, school children, childcare centers, libraries, hospitals, urgent care centers, universities , and others. A new Flu Ready Card is planned for r elease in June 2010 with a similar circulation. The card promotes the new near -universal influenza vaccination recommendation, encouraging everyone over six months of age to receive a flu vaccination. The card is aimed at adults and those with underlying health c onditions, including asthma, diabetes , and heart conditions. Targeting specific audiences was a lesson learned from the H1N1 2009 pandemic. More vaccination messages need to be geared to adults with chronic conditions. The LHD created Flu Ready Posters for local pharmacies, hospitals, businesses , worksites, schools, fairs , and festivals. Creative radio and television spots, in English and Spanish, were used during the H1N1 pandemic. A speakers ' bureau was activated and well -versed professionals spoke in co mmunity centers, residential neighborhood meetings, community service groups, and many other locations . The collaboration with supermarket and community pharmacies was presented on a webinar from the National Association of County and City Health Officials about Alternative Sites for Flu Vaccination Clinics: Recent Experiences and Lessons Learned on January 11, 2010 , as part of National Influenza Vaccination Week . To access the webinar , visit www.naccho.org/topics/h1n1/webcasts.cfm ; a simple and free registration is required . The collaboration was presented at NACCHO 's Preparedness Summit on February 17, 2010. PBCDH was the lead presenter and invited Lisa Koonin (CDC) to facili tate, and Michael Roberson (Publix) -Marie (Walgreens) , to co -present their findings. PBCHD was selected as the recipient of the National Immunization Excellence Award presented at the National Influenza Vaccination Summit meeting in May 2010. A presentation w as made highlighting the many partnerships used to form a comprehensive and coordinated seasonal and H1N1 influenza p revention, vaccination and response plan, including the collaboration with pharmacists. PBCHD also submitted articles for publication in peer -reviewed public health and pharmacy journals. Sustainability The LHD plans to sustain this partnership by including the community pharmacies in all -hazard s preparedness and response activities. The PBC Pharmacy Association and community pharmacy contacts will be invited to monthly meetings of the HERC, Region 7 public heal th preparedness meetings, tabletop exercises and drills, and to all health -related activities and fairs. The LHD is working with these contacts to prepa re health information brochures and find venues for partnership. However, the LHD will los e funding from the H1N1 federal program ; reduced personnel can impact the sustainability of the partnership. PBCHD will continue to partner with supermarket and chain drug store pharmacies and in -store retail health clinics for influenza prevention, vaccination , and re sponse. The LHD's goal is to expand this collaboration to other preparedness functions ( e.g., weather -related response and 11 chronic and acute disease -related prevention and response). To expand the collaboration , PBCHD will need to identify funding for personnel at the LHD to continue the work begun by the Influenza Readiness Initiative . Other Partnership Applications This partnership can be applied to other emergency preparedness and response opportunities. For hurricane preparedness, an annual prepar edness and response activity for PBCHD, new forms of collaboration are underway with community pharmacy. If there is a storm, the PBCHD ( health and medical unit) and the division of emergency management will have a direct line to the area pharmacy supervis or to know which stores are open and the status of pharmaceutical supplies. This partnership has already produced results including the invitation for pharmacists to participate at tabletop exercises and drills, involving them in preparedness activities. The pharmacy leadership will be assigned a seat at the emergency operations center , when and if a center is activated, and will become an integral part of the health and medical unit or Emergency Support Function (ESF #8) and business and industry unit (ESF #18). The partnership was beneficial following the devastating earthquake in Haiti. As survivors began coming to Palm Beach County following the earthquake, the LHD was able to connect with its local working pharmacy partners to ensure access to pharmaceuticals and vaccine. These pharmacy partners also assisted vaccinating local teams of search and rescue workers sent to Haiti to assist in the first days following th e disaster. Again, partnerships were in place and available to assist, regardless of the emergency or disaster. Consideration is underway to integrating community pharmacy into the PBCHD Cities Readiness Initiative (CRI). This federal program requires the LHD to have a plan to distribute antibiotics to the entire population of 1.3 million residents of Palm Beach County within 48 hours in response to an inhalation anthrax attack. The PBCHD has a plan involving public and closed points of distribution (POD) sites. NACCHO has recognized PBCHD for its Closed POD program in gated communities and other closed neighborhoods. The integration of pharmacists into this plan could be of great value in staffing public PODS and serving as a unique resource for the Closed POD program. This new adaptation of the partnership between the LHD and pharmacy for the CRI Antibiotic Distribution program is in early development , but promises benefits from such public -private collaborations. RECOMMENDATIONS Reasons for the success of this public -private collaboration were similar in motivation, and shared a common mission and purpose between the LHD and community pharmacy . The LHD and pharmacist were interested in providing the public with accurate and timely public health influenza messages and increasing access to flu vaccinations. One recommendation is to begin the partnership or collaborative effort before an emergency, disaster, pandemic , or other outbreak or event begins . During an emergency is not the time for exchanging bus iness cards and networking. The partnership should be exercised and drilled. In February 2009, the PBCHD invited Publix to be a participant in a Region 7 pandemic influenza tabletop exercise with four south Florida 12 LHDs . This was a first for the region an d for Publix . The exercise proved beneficial when a month later , there was a recall of a national baby food and the LHD had immediate access to the appropriate Publix personnel. LHDs should c onsider partnering with providers or agencies that share the sam e motivation, passion , and purpose. They should f ind opportunities to build trust and create working relationships, including invitations to work together on other related topics. Partners should continue to share information and be inclusive. CONTRIBUTORS Lisa A.
