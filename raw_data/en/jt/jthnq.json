Many people subscribe to the idea that their body needs to be put through a series of [detox](https://www.shefinds.com/collections/anti-inflammatory-detox-juices-belly-fat/) diets in order to feel and look its best. This can come in the form of [juice cleanses](https://www.shefinds.com/collections/long-term-downsides-juice-cleanses-registered-nutritionist/), [fasting](https://www.shefinds.com/collections/worst-intermittent-fasting-mistake/), and other fad diets, but the reality is that your body is actually perfectly equipped to detox itself without needing to subject yourself to the most obscure eating plan gleaned from an influencer claiming to have the key to [weight loss](https://www.shefinds.com/collections/high-protein-foods-for-weight-loss/). However, while your body does largely do the job on its own, including certain foods into your balanced diet can make the task that much easier, and in particular, certain fruit may be beneficial in ridding your body of toxins and promoting a healthier gut biome.

The reason apples are excellent for detoxing is simply due to the plant compounds found within this nutrient-rich fruit. \"Catechins are one example of a plant compound that increases the body's natural detoxification,\" notes Best. \"This compound can also be found in many whole foods which can be easily integrated into the diet. The benefit of taking these in through food sources is the added nutrients you receive from them along with replacing potentially calorie dense foods with nutrient dense ones.\" Tip: Avoid Eating Too Many Fried Foods If you are going to cut anything out of your diet to help improve your skin, let this one be it: fried foods. \"Frying releases free radicals which can contribute to the body having an excess amount off these cell-damaging compounds,\" Burdeos says.
