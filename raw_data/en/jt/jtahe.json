They distinguish themselves from other medicinal products in that their efficacy is exclusively based on traditional use. On the premise of pluralism in pharmacotherapy, the German Medicines Act explicitly postulates that the characteristics of the \"particular therapeutic systems\" are to be respected. For this reason, the legislator has established specific commissions (Commission C for anthroposophic medicinal products, Commission D for homeopathic medicinal products and Commission E for herbal medicinal products) to support the work of the BfArM by providing medical expertise in the respective therapeutic fields. Management and scientific support of the above mentioned commissions and the Commission under \u00a7 109a (3) AMG for traditional medicinal products is incumbent on Division 5 of the BfArM. Division 4 is in charge of the scientific evaluation of efficacy, safety and pharmaceutical quality of medicinal products appertaining to the \"particular therapeutic systems\" and of traditional medicinal products. Responsibilities cover the preparation of medical and pharmaceutical assessments as well as the entire administrative project management including the issuing of marketing authorisation on the basis of successful licensing, simplified registration or review procedures. Assessments are also prepared at the request of other divisions in variation or renewal procedures, in European licensing procedures for herbal medicinal products, in legal proceedings and questions of pharmacovigilance. So-called core data are drawn up reflecting the current state of the art in pharmacotherapy serving to standardise patient information leaflets and information directed to health professionals. Furthermore, scientific advice is provided prior to the start of licensing procedures at the request of pharmaceutical companies. Division 4 develops scientific principles and guidelines relating to the evaluation of medicinal products of the particular therapeutic systems and traditional medicinal products. Members of Division 4 participate in national and international expert committees (e.g. Herbal Medicinal Products Committee (HMPC) of the European Medicines Agency (EMA), Homeopathic Medicinal Products Working Group (HMPWG) of the EU Heads of Agencies) and are thus essentially involved in transferring current scientific knowledge into European and WHO guidelines. The following statistic tables gives an overview on herbal, homeopathic, anthroposophic and traditional medicinal products with completed marketing authorisation or registration procedure which are available on the German market.
