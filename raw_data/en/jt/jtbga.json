Here are the results. Introduction This is a preliminary qualitative study looking at the effects of an 8 week course of [Homeopathic Detox Therapy (HDT)](http://hpathy.com/homeopathy-papers/homeopathic-detox-therapy-hdt-cease-therapy/) to detoxify residual elements of the childhood vaccinations. From a homeopathic perspective, vaccines can cause ongoing harm within the body. This is thought to be due to a combination of unresolved viral elements in addition to ongoing damage caused by adjuvants such as aluminium hydroxide, formaldehyde, MSG, antibiotics and animal DNA. Administering the vaccines in homeopathic form is observed to stimulate observable physical detoxification reactions and results in an improvement in chronic symptoms following the 8 week course of remedies. This project aims to identify the kind of improvements and reactions that can be expected with such an approach. Design The vaccination detoxification pack was offered to those parents who observed a temporal link between vaccination and the onset of their child's health issues. 130 vaccination packs were sent out, with instructions on how to administer the remedies. The pack included homoeopathically potentised* versions of the childhood vaccines as a 'poly' ascending remedy series (30C, 200C, 1M, 10M). A 'Saturday' remedy of Carcinosin Cum Cuprum and a daily morning remedy Nux Vomica, 6C for liver support was also provided. Participants were asked to report their observations during, and up to 2 weeks after the end of detox. The course duration was 8 weeks (2 weeks at each of the 4 potencies). Results Of the 130 participants that were sent packs, 43 participants did not respond to the follow-up email. They were then classed as non-participant. Of the remaining 87 participants, 73 reported improvements in symptoms following the course of detox, 6 experienced temporary aggravations during the course without improvements afterwards, and 8 reported no observable effects. Some parents completed an [ATEC](http://www.surveygizmo.com/s3/1329619/Autism-Treatment-Evaluation-Checklist-revised) both before and after the round of treatment. Of those who did, the majority showed a lower ATEC following treatment. In future studies, there should be an emphasis of measurable data from the ATEC test both before and after treatment. OBSERVATIONS: Common improvements reported following the vaccination detox: - increased comprehension & learning / awareness of external world - increase in attention span - language / cognitive improvements - decreased stimming - decreased anxiety - appetite changes - decrease in hyperactive behaviour - reduction in emotional outbursts - improved empathy - improved eye-contact Common aggravations reported during the 8 week detox phase - fevers - rashes - diarrhoea - loss of appetite - sweating (particularly at night) - increased emotional outbursts / tantrums - toilet 'accidents' increased (temporary) - hyperactivity temporarily increased - defiant behaviours - increase in stimming / hand-flapping / obsessive behaviours. Lessons Learned A follow-up consultation was scheduled with those participants who did not show improvement during the course. A full case history was taken. In the majority of these cases, there were events in the timeline which were of greater significance (from the perspective of the Homeopathic Detox Therapy model) in the child's health issues. Most commonly, this was hormonal or steroid intervention. It became apparent that hormonal disruptors should be dealt with before tackling the vaccinations. This is in line with the HDT model, which states that synthetic hormones (including steroids) are often the most damaging of allopathic interventions. Whilst outcomes were positive, it became clear that the best outcome with HDT requires a full case history to be taken, rather than a 'one size fits all' approach, even when a cohort has a shared aetiology (vaccination). Following on from the project in the many cases I have treated since, the importance of other toxins has become more apparent. For example, certain antibiotics have been observed to be extremely damaging and are a more significant 'aetiology' than the vaccines in certain instances. Anaesthetics and Oxytocin during labour are also very significant in the timeline. In short, as clinical data is amassed, it becomes apparent that vaccines are just one of many damaging allopathic interventions which can cause chronic health problems in children. This said, it is my belief that vaccinations are one of the most damaging events in a child's timeline. This is due to their propensity to cause long-term immune dysfunction. The 'injected' nature of administration makes them extremely harmful as this bypasses primary immune response. This can be very problematic in susceptible children. In addition, I have grave concerns regarding the toxic nature of the adjuvants, in particular heavy metals (aluminium hydroxide and thimerosal) which are known neurotoxins. Conclusion HDT is observed in this study to be a promising treatment for vaccination damage. It is most effective when administered alongside an appropriate dietary regime and orthomolecular support to aid detox of displaced heavy metals (zinc and selenium in particular). In this preliminary study, younger children were observed to make greater gains from treatment. Parents should therefore be encouraged to seek treatment as soon as they suspect that their child has been adversely effected by vaccination. In addition, reading the case notes from hundreds of responders (only 130 were used due to funding constraints), one could see some very clear repetitive patterns of decline. One of the most striking observations was the consistent suppression of fevers and gastrointestinal symptoms following vaccination using paracetamol preparations and antibiotics. It is often this combination that preceded a rapid decline in health and a descent into the autistic picture. Parents who wish to partake in vaccination programmes should be properly educated about the dangers of suppressing any associated fever. This is in line with findings from a study in [Cuba](http://www.greatplainslaboratory.com/home/eng/Acetaminophen.asp), where paracetamol is not recommended following vaccination, and where incidence of autism is significantly lower than the UK and the USA. In general, a rule of thumb for parents would be to question and research any recommended medical intervention for their children. The risks often outweigh the benefits. The lack of research investigating the long-term effects of vaccinations in children means that by consenting to these practices, the child is effectively a 'guinea pig', who is partaking in the experiment without informed consent. I would urge parents to proceed with caution, in spite of any proclamations that a drug or vaccine is 'perfectly safe'. There is no such thing, as will be apparent from the long list of side effects in any package insert. Please contact me ( [annaraynerhomeopath@gmail.com](mailto:annaraynerhomeopath@gmail.com)) if you would like more information regarding HDT for your child. Parental Accounts from 8 Week Vaccination Detox Here are a selection of parental accounts provided: Participant 1 NA finished the detox on 5/4/15. The fits of anger diminished following the accelerated course of Tuberculinum. Today, we are no longer seeing any of the anger which was so problematic. I have noticed he is more present that before we started treatment. He engages in less stimming, and even when it does appear, it tends to be much shorter in duration. He is now more calm and is communicating far better with me. I truly notice a great improvement, and I now see the possibility of a 'normal' child when I observe him. Of course he has many things still to learn, but he is much more cooperative in his behaviour, and he is calmer and more receptive. Participant 2 What you read will make it quite obvious what EM and those of us around have experienced. It has been wonderful watching and feeling her really and enjoying close contact, touch and affection now in the same way her brother does. Before, when I wanted to cuddle her she would squirm away. Now she is actively enjoying cuddles saying 'hmm, mummy, I love this. I want to stay like this forever'. It feels AMAZING. Her confidence has also increased to a higher level. Here are some of my observations: - Increase in eye-contact, and appropriate use of greetings with strangers - Increase in pretend play - Huge increase in affectionate behaviour - cuddles etc. - Appropriate speech, more elaborate speech, use of 'I' rather than 3rd person. - Helping around house - reports it is to 'help mummy'. This level of empathy has never happened before. Participant 3 ATEC score at start of vaccination detox: 99 ATEC score on follow-up: 53 Physical observations during detox: - Changes in bowel movements - Increased sweating and thirst - increased energy - Night waking when remedy was given Behavioural changes: - Increased irritability due to more awareness of surroundings - Increase in creative play / interest in outside world - more aware and connected to surroundings - Increase in vocalisations - at the beginning of the treatment began saying 3 word sentences - Increase in hand-flapping during the detox - Increased attention span - More adventurous appetite - trying new foods. Used to scream at new foods. - Improved motor control - drawing. - Increased interaction with caregiver - started giving kisses - Eye contact - much better - Anxiety levels - increased initially. - Did regress in potty training, and also making us feed him where he used to feed himself. - Started waving, saying bye bye, and hi - In general much more connected to surroundings. Participant 4 I just want share with you my experience during AD's 8 week vaccination detox process. We finished 8 weeks on march 26/15. * I see his changes especially expressing himself, better social skills and more focus. * His health is much better - he is not falling sick so often * During the detox process, I saw many toxins getting out, especially from the skin (rashes etc.) I want to really thank you..he is getting much much better. Participant 5 Here is our summary of the detox that we started in November 2014. First week, slept far better than usual. Was eating less than usual. He wasn't coping with unplanned events at all well, and kept closing his eyes. His stools changed consistency and were more often than usual. Week 2: a spectacular regression! Incredibly irritated / irascible, hardly spoke, angrily crying, lots of stereotyped behaviours. Diarrhoea and nausea for 3 days, very tired. This however passed. We started the Vaccination Detox on 22/12/14. We had a very good period - LB was very connected, sleeping well, responding to questions more - everyone was remarking on his progress (at school for example). On 5/2/15 we had another regression. He was agitated, lots of stimming, moving like a robot, echolalia. He did however have a large appetite, and was sleeping well. After the end of the detox things settled back down, and he remains much calmer, better connected, and more responsive to his external environment. We look forward to continuing treatment. Participant 6 We are happy to inform you about the successful completion of the vaccination detox protocol. Great results we can corroborate. Eye contact improvement, conduct improvement, the attention periods are bigger and is more interested in other tasks and activities, the facial expressions are more vivid and he is more interested in interpreting them. Other important improvement are a number of new foods added to his diet, and he is a lot more interested on taste new foods. It is a big improvement in that area for us. We are extremely interested in the other detox protocols that may help our son further. Participant 7 We just finished treatment and we are very pleased! AW is showing more comprehension and communication, improvement in bilateral coordination (she just learned hiw to pedal her bike after 3 years of trying!), less OCD behavior, willing to try new foods, showing more independence (she wants to do what others do and doesn't want help). For the first time in her life I am able to take her to the playground and just watch her! She is also coming close to other kids, greeting them and interacting more with them. We only saw some periods when she was more sensory and cranky, also some days waking up at night, but nothing compared to where she was years ago when she would wake up in the middle of the night and be awake for hours and showing OCD behavior. I wish I could give you a huge hug. THANK YOU! What do we do next? She still has lots to catch up. Is there anything else that can help her? Love homeopathy!!! Participant 8 JP changed significantly during the protocol. He often had fever after the Nux Vomica 6CH in the morning, marked skin rashes also. Better eye/hand coordination, and increased ability in art - better able to hold a pen. His comprehension was notably increased, and he was more rapidly understanding instructions. He had new interest in food. Since the start of the constant rounds of antibiotics following MMR, he has been severely picky. He would only eat about 3 different foods. I noticed during the detox he started to be naturally curious about food, and eat spontaneously (new foods). The smell of the dinner cooking would now make him laugh. He did have some constipation throughout the detox. He now has more energy, and is much more curious about the world around him. He can now show me when I ask him where something is hurting. This is entirely new. There is an increase in showing his emotions, crying when sad etc. He seems to now have 'life in his eyes'. After the vaccination detox receptive language is ++++ Participant 9 BA is doing great and continues to speak more and more every day. Just night potty trained himself. He refused a night diaper 4 nights ago and has had a dry bed every morning. Will sometimes even get up and pee in the middle of the night\". Additional observations from mother's notes during the 8 weeks: - Increase in vocab; - More 'humour' observed - Making himself laugh more. - Singing a great deal. - More 'enquiries' about the world around him - externalising. - Saying 'bye bye' unprompted. - Increase in spontaneous learning of new skills. Participants 10 & 11 We started the vaccine protocol in November 2014. After a week of treatment, Twin1's behavior improved, there was more language, his anxiety diminished and he was following more complexed instructions. After another week Twin2 started with the screaming and hand-flapping. He did a lot of talking but not in a conversation, he was trying though to communicate. There were no sleeping disturbances but there were with their appetite. Twin1 was really dependent of his mom. Their faeces were very smelly and with dark residues, like soil. No constipation was present. After 1 month of treatment, Twin1, started hitting his mom, pulling her hair and pressing her breasts really hard. At times he was happy, then furious, will start to hit her and then kissed her. Something really significant was that Twin1 was usually very anxious and with the treatment the anxiety disappeared. At week 8, there was vomiting and a skin reaction around the lip area of Twin1. He presented cracked, fissured and peeled lips. No more hitting Mom and we continue to see positive results. Participant 12 Physically when we started, he had rashes on his face and torso that lasted a few weeks. He had runny nose and increased thirst as well. Behaviorally, the day after a dose, he would be crankier, more oppositional. Overall, his receptive and expressive language has increased a lot. He has initiated more pretend play, has initiated play with his brother. He will sit and do homework for a longer period of time. He was always affectionate, but only with me but will now go to his teachers, father, brother and ask for hugs on his own. He knows the time for bathtime/bedtime and will ask us to take him to bath or bed. He imitates speech more and knows he needs to verbally ask for things and that has increased a lot. The change he has had in play and understanding and his behavior has been very noticeable to us at home, and by school and therapists. His ATEC score went from a 23 to 17 over the 8 weeks. Participant 13 OCTOBER 11/2014: 1st week: loose stools, rash and headache.. 2nd week: still with rash. Prominent red tiny marks (rash looking not blisters like on Ch.pox), on both arms and his checks . OCTOBER 21/2014: ANGER which lasted the whole rest of the course. Thursday, Nov, 02, 2014 5 week\" POLY VACC 1M: parasites on stool Nov, 20, 2014: final day of the detox course. Nov, 25, 2014: A flare of creativity. He wanted and decided to \"write a book\" (he told me what to write) he was also the illustrator. He remained mad and very very bad behavior all remaining month and December. 2014 but it settled down. Jan, 2015: TEACHER TOLD ME HE IS DOING AWESOME!! Participant 14 Throughout the vaccination detox, we noticed rashes (eczema flares localized on JH's right thigh and upper right buttock and keratosis pilaris on his arms, legs, and cheeks), a change in bowel movements (daily and appropriate color/consistency), minor cold symptoms on and off consisting of a runny/stuffy nose and cough, and positive appetite changes (eating more food and a much wider variety of food!). During the detox, we saw some behavioral changes in terms of irritability and anger as well as crying easily. As we got to the 10M potency, we began to see changes in speech and language-more complete sentences and Jack explaining what he wants/needs. JH seems to have a better understanding of explanations and stories on TV too. We feel the biggest changes occurred with the improvement in bowel movements and the changes in his appetite. JH used to be more limited in his diet and ate too little. Now he's eating what we eat, and as much as we eat most of the time! When we started the vaccination detox, JHs ATEC score was a 28. As of this week, his ATEC score is a 17! We are so thrilled! We would love to continue treating JH with homeopathic remedies! I'm sure there are many things on his timeline that are still affecting him and we'd like to help him continue to heal! Participant 15 We finished the 8 week vaccine detox, I am very very happy with the results I saw in my son. His reactions were high fever, very hard to lower it down, the fever always was next day after giving the poly 200. He missed school and also slept a lot in the night like 13 hours in a row which is very atypical in him. We saw little rashes on face, and one day with vomit, like 3 times, and both boys had very hard days in behavior on sundays (after the ccc dosage on saturdays). I can definitely say in particular my youngest son has a lot of positive changes: his hyperactivity decreased, better mood, more social interaction, better attention, initiation in play requesting to play, more expressive language, now he is watching t.v. understanding what is happening and laughing at jokes on cartoons, before it was hard for him to entertain himself, he was not interested in tv. nb: in the follow up consultation it was found that the older brother had a lot of steroid exposures, which we are now clearing. This often 'blocks' remedy action, and as a matter of course I would now address this 'layer' as a first prescription. Participant 16 We saw a NOTICABLE increase in J's social skills. His desire to engage and be included in activities (patiently playing boardgames, going to the park and wanting to play basketball with others instead of digging in the sand by himself, joining discussions with appropriate and relevant contributions) was noticed not only by us but by extended family members as well. We saw an increase in him initiating affection- hugs, snuggles, tickling. Something that he has never done before, he talked about a bullying incident that happened to him several years ago, before his recovery from his autism symptoms. He brought it up and said he'd like to one day ask the boys who hurt him why they did it. I had to pick my jaw up off the floor! He has been extremely redirectable/agreeable. Also, his ability to verbalize his feelings, especially anger/frustration/sadness, has been amazing. His ability to focus has increased. There seems to be a calmness to him now that wasn't there before. Needless to say, even though J was already recovered from his autism symptoms, we cannot believe the progress we have seen in him the past few months. J did not have any negative side effects that we noticed. No rashes, fevers, etc. I want to thank you so much for having J participate in the detox trial! We had never tried homeopathy before, but now I wish we would have. Participant 17 Initially starting homeopathy, we saw increased hyperactivity and had to revert to some calming techniques we hadn't used in quite some time. However, in just a few days, his words were clearer and he was having more meaningful and age appropriate conversations. During the second week, we had an unusual meltdown and stubborn behavior. But, before the second week was out, he became interested in age appropriate television. The last 6 weeks were full of gains of self awareness, self discipline and self-learning. We couldn't be more pleased with this protocol, as we have tried many treatments over the past 7 years. Participant 18 We started poly vacc detox on September 29th on my 4,5 year old son, the first signs of detox appeared two days later: I noticed his thirst and fatiguability at once, a week later, he wetted his pants daytime unexpectedly, he also went several times a day to the toilet, urinating and moving his bowels more, his urine had an unusual strong smell. At the same time, I observed positive change in his social skills: he was playing adequately whereas I had never observed this before to that degree. In fact, all along the detox course, my son improved his skills by playing a wide range of games: from a set of stamps to a board game. He also started writing, drawing and painting at home, sharing with us. The quality of his hair was improved I noticed a month later, it passed from rough and mat to smooth and shiny. I acknowledge language skills and interactions have improved by a lot 20 days after starting, for instance, asking meaningful questions like \u00ab what's in that box over there? \u00bb or expressing himself clearly like \u00ab a bit more, please \u00bb( for food or playing). He also learnt how to sulk and rebel against us using words adequately. I also witness that during the detox course he was more hyper, more sensitive to sounds and stereotypies reemerged a few times. His ATEC before poly vacc detox was 57 and after it came down to 31. Participant 19 We did the detox early this year. We started in 01/15 and ended the detox in 02/15. Fortunately, we had great results. I noticed a lot of RJ's sensory issues improved. Less sensitive to noise. Able to eat different foods with different consistencies. Less sensitive to clothes. We can pretty much dress him in anything now. The best and greatest result has been his cognitive function and more language. During the detox it self we noticed his behavior became a problem again. Definitely a regression with more tantrums, attention seeking behavior, elopement, and avoidance to any demand placed on him. It was a though 8 weeks, but all worth it. No fevers that I noticed or cold like symptoms. The only changes that were noticeable was the regression in behavior. I wanted to reach out to you about doing a second round of the detox. * diluted beyond the point of material dose using the sequential dilution succussion methodology.
