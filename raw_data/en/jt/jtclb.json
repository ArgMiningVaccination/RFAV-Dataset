{"title": "Complementary and Alternative Medicine - Herbals and Supplements: A Review for the Primary Care Physician", "author": "Surya Davuluri; T S Dharmarajan", "url": null, "hostname": null, "description": "The pursuit of well-being coupled with perceived beliefs, suggested benefits, and myths have led to the widespread use of Complementary and Alternative Medicine (CAM). The terms Complementary and Alternative Medicine are often used interchangeably, although differences exist. The health care expenditure involving the use of CAM is estimated to be in the billions of dollars. Evidence-based medicine is the foundation of today's conventional (or allopathic) medicine. If the same principles of allopathic medicine can be extrapolated to CAM, one could more comfortably promote the use of CAM for the overall betterment of health and well-being and hopefully a favorable impact on health care. With the growing use of CAM by adults worldwide, providers must become informed and be able to discuss some of the potential benefits and harms, as well as possible interactions between CAM and conventional therapy. A discussion is included on nuts, caffeine, and alcohol, in addition to the use and misuse of vitamins.", "sitename": "Cureus", "date": "2014-06-02", "cleaned_text": "On May 25, 2018, the GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) went into effect and changed how organizations deal with personal data of customers located in the EU.
