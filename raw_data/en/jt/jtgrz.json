My own Spiritual path with Anthroposophy and Rudolf Steiner I first 'met' Rudolf Steiner and Anthroposophy in 1992 at a Bio-Dynamic workshop in Tasmania. During the workshop I heard a Dutch Anthroposophist Farmer describing the B.D. Preparations and talking about Venus, the Moon and other planets and I was hooked - this was all too familiar! Before long I had converted my 7 acre property into a Certified Organic/Bio-Dynamic farm and joined the Anthroposophical Society. Later, in 1998, I joined the 'First Class', better known as the (Esoteric) Spiritual School of Spiritual Science. Over the years I have been on several committees including: The Tasmanian Bio-Dynamic Association, The Victorian Anthroposophical Society and The Cape Byron Steiner School Board. Since 1992 and up until 2013, all of my six of my children attended a Steiner school for part of their education. In 1997, I completed a one year training (Certificate IV Anthroposophical Studies) at the Melbourne Rudolf Steiner Seminar in Australia and then went on to complete my Advanced Diploma in Psychophonetics* Counseling and Psychotherapy (in Australia and South Africa). *Psychophonetics is an Anthroposophically based modality of Counseling and Psychotherapy developed by Persephone College Founder and Director Yehuda Tagar, and is based very much on Steiner's work on Psycosophy, Sound and Movement. For over a decade now, I have been working as a self-employed therapist and teacher in Australia and overseas supporting people to become much more conscious and aware in their lives - physically, emotionally, mentally and spiritually. I do this, in part, with my skills, insights and experiences that I have gained through my study and work with Anthroposophy. I offer talks and presentations and workshops and coaching and training programs to help support what I call the development of the 'I' and the 'Future Potential Self'. I explain much of this in my book - Where Am 'I' Right Now? is a new, 21st century, leading edge book that is partly based around my 25 years of working with many of the initiatives laid down by Rudolf Steiner. This book refreshingly offers us ways to move far beyond the 'what' to do world, to the more practical and empowering world of 'how' to do it; a rare find in today's rapidly expanding personal development market. As the reader journeys through this book, they will have the opportunity to engage in, and work through, the practical exercises and tasks offered to them to help them reach a higher sense of self-empowerment and conscious awareness.

To read an excerpt of the book please click below Another book that I have contributed to is, Psychophonetics - Holistic Counseling and Psychotherapy - Stories and Insights from Practice edited by Robin Steele and published by Lindisfarne Books . The first part of the book, by Robin Steele, introduces Psychophonetics - its background and context, an outline of its theory and methods, and the structure of a typical therapy session, as well as descriptions of client experiences. Part two of the book is written by several Psychophonetics therapists and includes stories, research, and insights from their practice. The authors cover topics such as using artistic expression in illness and pain; working with past childhood sexual abuse; the art of conversation; using clay in therapy; grief and loss; self-parenting; menopause; cancer; case studies, and more. Drawings and poetry are included to show how creative expression in used in the counseling process. This book is the essential introduction to Psychophonetics and the first book to focus on this emerging field of spiritually oriented counseling and therapy. Psychophonetics, is accessible and intended for the professional and the general reader alike. My chapter is called An Eco-Soul Bush Experience - Therapy in the Bush. In this work I take clients into the realms of nature and work there to support them through their issue, challenges and questions in life.
