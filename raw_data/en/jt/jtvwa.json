A MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT, DR. JUDY GENSHAFT Thank you for your interest in graduate education at the University of South Florida System. USF is a Top 50 research university that has been named by the Chronicle of Higher Education as one of the fastest growing research universities in the nation in federal funding. We are distinguished by our excellent research and graduate education and our location in a major urban region tha t is among the nation\u00b9s most diverse and desirable places to live. Strong interdisciplinary programs put USF on the leading edge of research and graduate education in a number of areas. For example, collaboration among researchers throughout the university has made USF a leader in the neuroscience of aging and USF' s interdisciplinary doctoral program in Aging Studies was the first of its kind in the nation. Recently, USF's Industrial/Organizational Psychology program was ranked highest in the nation for publication in peerreviewed journals and the Princeton Review has named USF's Center for Entrepreneurship one of the Top Entrepreneurial Graduate Programs in the co untry. In addition to doctoral programs, USF offers many opportunities for postgraduate study through our many Master's and Graduate Certificate programs, many of which are designed to prepare graduates to make immediate contributions to the economic, cultural and social vitality of communities. A growing focus for the university is enlisting leading industries in our area as partners in graduate programs as evidenced by our new partnership with the Tampa Bay Lightning, The Lightning Foundation and USF's College of Business in an MBA in Sport and Entertainment Mana gement, a program emphasizing the business funda m entals of the sports and entertainment industry. Our commitment to discovery and the application of knowledge relevant to urban communities has earned USF frequent citations as a model of an \"engaged university.\" The opportunities for graduate education at USF are vast, and we have worked hard to build an environmen t th at supports and encourages innovation. In many areas, USF offers programs that prepare you to make your best contribution to a challenging world. I invite you to inquire further about USF programs of interest to you. Sincerely yours, Judy Genshaft, Ph.D. President Office of the President http://system.usf.e du/president/about president genshaft.asp USF Tampa Graduate Catalog 2013 2014 Section 1 Welcome to Graduate Studies! 2 A MESSAGE FROM THE PROVOST AND EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT, DR. RALPH WILCOX As one of the nation's best and fastest growing research universities, the University of South Florida is attracting in ever growing numbers many of the world's best and brightest students, which today, as you read this, includes you. Thank you for considering USF to be your academic home as you prepare to embark on the challenging yet ultimately rewarding journey of graduate education. It is a serious commit ment, and one to which the dedicated faculty and staff at USF attach utmost importance. Our shared promise is to engage you in meaningful programs and initiatives that support the educational, health, and socioeconomic wellbein g of the local, national, and global commun ities we all serve \u2014 efforts that embrace interdisciplinary inquiry and collaboration as the keys to success not only within our academic programs, but also in the globally interwoven world of 21st century business, communications, and culture. Reflective of this innovative approach to research with realworld impact is the university's new College of Global Sustainability, th e first in the United States, focused on preparing students for a new generation of \"green collar\" careers finding solutions for the increasing dangers to our fragile environment and limited resources. Its graduate program in global sustainability integrates various disciplines such as natural and social sc iences, engineering, economics, government, public health, and policymaking in courses \u2014 many available online \u2014 led by USF faculty members and researchers eager to inspire tomorrow's leaders for global challenges never before imagined. Among our professors are leading scholars in their respective fields, who readily engage new graduate students in the laboratory, the library, and othe r research areas. Their number includes Professor of Mechanical Engineering and 2012 U.S. Professor of the Year Autar Kaw, known around the world for his innovative use of technology and social media to expand learning opportunities for students, as well as 15 facul ty colleagues elected as fellows of the American Association for the Advancem e nt of Science in 2012 \u2014 the fourthhighest total among all U.S. universities. USF also ranks as a Top Producer of Fulbright Scholars. Such recognition speaks to both the professional regard afforded to our faculty members by their peers worldwide and the quality of academic mentoring available to our graduate students across a broad range of scholarly endeavors. At USF, we encourage student s and faculty to forge real relationships that replace the more academic department centered experience common of most other graduate schools. We believe, too, that interdisciplinary partnerships between students, faculty, and researchers acros s campus, in the commu nity, and around the world strengthen both the university and the graduate student experience at USF, creating a \"collaboration for competition\" that often leads to new knowledge and exciting, innovative solutions to pervasive and emerging problems. Continuing to deliver topquality graduate programs remains a leading priority for USF as it enhances further its position as a premier research universit y with state, national, and global impact. The University of South Florida is a place where you can challenge yourself and focus on how you are able to contribute to your chosen discipline, your community, and the worldatlar ge in a meaningful and sustainable way. Whether your career aspirations are to remain in academe or to pursue professional positions in the public sector, business or industry, I am confident that your investment of time, talent, and energy as a graduate student at USF will present you with wonderful and exhilarating prospects for the future.

Searchable Faculty Database On the Office of Graduate Studies website is a searchable database that provides information on graduate faculty and research interests. http://www.grad.usf.edu/ programs/faculty.asp Also reference USF Policy 10115 - Faculty Credentials for Teaching Undergraduate and Graduate Courses http://generalcounsel.usf.edu/policies andprocedures/pdfs/policy 10115.pdf USF Tampa Graduate Catalog 2013 2014 Section 4 Graduate Admissions 13 Section 4 Graduate Admissions Office of Admissions University of South Florida Office of Admissions 4202 East Fowler Graduate Admissions Elizabeth O'Connell, Ph.D. University Admissions Criteria and Policies USF Regulation USF3008: http://generalcounsel.usf.ed u/regulations/pdfs/regulation usf3.008.pdf Statement of Principles In graduate admission decisions, multiple sources of information should be used to ensure fairness, promote diversity and balance the limitations of any single measure of knowledge, skills, or abilities. The sources may include: undergraduate grade point average, letters of recommendation, personal statements, samples of academic work, portfolios, auditions, professional experience related to proposed gradu ate study, as well as nationally known, standardized test scores. It is the responsibility of each graduate program to select admissions criteria that best predict success in their specific field and to determine the weight given to each measure. None of the sources of information, parti cularly standardized test scores, should be used in isolation nor should such scores be used in comb ination or separately to es tablish minimum or \"cut off\" scores. Program specific guidelines for the use of standardized test scores should be developed based on the experience of a given department with its pool of applicants.1 1 Adapted from the GRE \"Guide to the Use of Scores\" 2003-2003 USF Tampa Graduate Catalog 2013 2014 Section 4 Graduate Admissions 14 Admission Requirements Each applicant to a graduate program at the University of South Florida is required to meet the following minimum requirements: 1.

USF Tampa Graduate Catalog 2013 2014 Section 4 Graduate Admissions 15 Application Process (How it works) Graduate applicants are urged to submit accurate and complete information as early as possible. Applications and supporting documents received after the application deadline will not be acted upon but will be kept on file for up to one year. At the request of the applicant or graduate program, they will be processed for the next available term. Please note if the graduate program is a Direct Receipt Program (http://www.grad.usf.edu/graduate admissions directreceipt.asp ). For Direct Receipt Programs application materials should be uploaded with the online application AND the hard copies should be sent directly to the program (NOT to the Office of Graduate Admissions.) All inquiries regarding application status should also be directed to the Program. The Graduate Admissions Office and the Graduate Program review your application for admission to the Office of Graduate Studies. Once the graduate program reviews your eligibility for its graduate program the y will forward their decision to the Graduate Admissions Office which, in turn, will issue the official decision. If you are a foreign graduate applicant, the International Services Office (http://global. usf.edu/isss/prospect.html ) will evaluate your financial statement after you are admitted to determine your eligibility for a student visa. Your financial statement must be dated within 6 months of the starting the degree program. Each of these offices may request additional documents from you to make a decision. For a complete list of gradua te programs and deadline dates please visit the Office of Graduate Studies website at http://www.grad.usf .edu/programs.php USF Tampa Graduate Catalog 2013 2014 Section 4 Graduate Admissions 16 Graduate Admission Application Deadlines The University deadlines for graduate admission are listed below. However, many academic programs have earlier deadlines than those established by the University, or may admit only for a specific term, A few programs may have later deadlines, if approved by Graduate Council. Applications must be received by the approved Graduate Program deadl ine. However, Graduate applications and supportin g ma terials should be submitted well in advance of the published program deadline, especially for those applicants who are interested in being considered for assistantships, tuition waivers, and fellowships. Applicants who want to be considered for Office of Graduate Studies fellowships must have all application documents on file at USF prior to the prog ram's application deadline OR Febr uary 15, whichever comes first. Applicants should check with the prospective Program to determine if there is an earlier deadline for consideration of fellowships the Program may offer.

While advisors, directors, department chairpersons, and deans are available to assist the student meet these requirements, it is ultimately the responsibility of the student to be acquainted with all policies and regulations, and be responsible for completing requirements. If requirements for graduation have not been satis fied, the degree will not be granted. The information presented here represents the University Academic Policies. Colleges and departments may have additional requirements. Check with your College Graduate Coordinator or your Department Program Director for more information. Courses, programs, and requirements described in the Catalog may be suspended, deleted, restricted, supplem ented, or changed at any time at the sole discretion of the University and the Boar d of Trustees. For a list of current course descriptions, refer to the Search ABull database online at http://www.ugs.usf.edu/sab/sabs.cfm . Student Conduct Members of the University community support high standards of individual conduct and human relations. Responsibility for one's own conduct and respect for the rights of others are essential conditions for academic and personal freedom within the University. USF reserves the right to deny admission or refuse enrollment to students whose actions are contrar y to the purposes of the University or impair the welfare or freedom of other members of the University communit y . Disciplinary procedures are followed when a student fails to exercise responsibility in an acceptable manner or commits an offense as outlined in the Student Conduct Code. Refer to the USF 6.0021, Student Code of Conduct at http://generalcounsel.usf.ed u/regulations /pdfs/regulation usf6.0021.pdf Responsible Conduct of Research Responsible Conduct of Research (RCR) is a critical element in training for scholarship. USF has information about RCR available online at: www.grad.usf.edu/rcr.php Effective Spring 2013, the Office of Graduate Studies requires all new doctoral students to have basic RCR training by completing the Collaborative Institutional Training Initiative (CITI) module most relevant to the student's program of study. The CITI modules have been designed to introduce researchers to various elements of research conduct ranging from research misconduct to data management to mentoring. As this is a minimum requirement, specific doctoral programs may require trai ning that goes beyond the basic components introduced in this module. USF Tampa Graduate Catalog 2013 2104 Section 7 Academic Policies and Regulations 36 Graduate Programs that have received Office of Graduate Studies approval for rigorous RCR training consistent with disciplinary standards and practices may exempt their students from the CITI requirement. Students must complete the module, or provide evidence of previous qualified RCR training to their Program Director and Office of Graduate Studies, in the first semester enrolled in a doctoral program. Previous RCR training should have been completed within the past year. Students will be unable to register for courses in a future semester until successful fulfillment of this RCR requirement. Once the training is completed, the Registration hold will be lifted. Intellectual and Scholarship Integrity Shared Authorship and Research Education Policy USF contains a broad range of academic programs in diverse disciplines, and the USF faculty recognize that the conventions on shared authorship and credit for scholarship vary among disciplines. In general, sharing in authorship implies both substantive intellectual contributions to the work and also approval of the work as it appears in public. Right to authorship credit is not au tomatically conveyed by being the instructor of a course, being a student's major professor, or being a research assistant working with faculty and professional researchers; neither is credit automatically prohibited because of such status. Each college /program that includes research education shall include an explicit discussion of shar ed authorship issues and disciplinary conventions as part of the formal curriculum addressing research methods and ethics, including the conventions of the discipline's publications. In addition, each college or program shall have a formal statement about shared authorship made available to students (such as on a college or program website) or given to students at the same time as they are given notice abo ut other program and college expectations. Each college/program shall also have a written procedure for resolving questions or conflicts about shared authorship where students are involved. The college and prog ram may use the same procedure for resolving questions for nonstude nt em ployees, but the procedure for resolving questions or conflicts involving students must address the educational needs of students (e.g., explicitly asking about the nature of the research methods and ethics education as experienced by a student involved in the case at hand ). This written procedure must be made available to students (such as on a college or program website) or given to students at the same time as they are given notice about other program and university expectations. Academic Integrity of Students Reference USF Regulation 3.027 To read the entire Regulation, go to: http://generalcounsel.usf.ed u/regulations/pdfs/regulation usf3.027.pdf Please note the sections that specifically pertain to graduate students.

Graduate Catalog The USF Tampa Graduate Catalog, including college and program requirements, and program and course descriptions, is available on the web at http://www.grad.usf.edu . Each Catalog is published and in effect for the academic term(s) noted on the title page. Student's Program Degree Requirements In order to graduate, students must meet all requirements specified in the USF Catalog of their choice, except as noted below. As the University is dynamic, changes and updates to the catalog are anticipated. In contract to program requirements, which are tied to a specific catalog, all student s must comply with University policies and procedures that come into effect each catalog year. Students cannot choose a USF Catalog published prior to admission (or readmission) or during an academic year in which they did not complete at least two terms. If a studen t is dropped from the system and must be reinstated, the st udent's choice of Catalog is limited to the USF Catalog in effect at the time of readmission or any one Catalog published during their continuous reenrollment. If state law or certification requirements change, the student must comp ly with the most current standard or criteria. If the College or Department makes fundamental chan ge s to the program that necessitates changes in the degree requirements of enrolled students, the needs of those students will be explicitly addressed in the proposal for change and scrutinized by the Office of Graduate Studies. USF policies and proce dur es not related to degree requirements such as academic grievance procedures, student conduct code and other procedural processes and definitions may be updated each year and the student will be held to the most current catalog and procedures available. USF does not commit itself to offer all the courses, programs, and majors listed in this Catalog. If the studen t cannot meet all of the graduation requirements specified in the Catalog of choice as a result of decisions and changes made by the University, appropriate substitutions will be determined by the program to ensure that the student is not penalized. USF Tampa Graduate Catalog 2013 2104 Section 7 Academic Policies and Regulations 38 Student/Advisor Relationship Although it is ultimately the responsibility of the student to be acquainted with all policies and regulations, and be responsible for completing requirements, the Advisor's role is to guide students in all aspects of their academic program and to monitor and evaluate students' progress toward their degrees. He/she should be aware of any difficulties that students may be facing in their coursework or research experiences and should work with students in resolving these issues. It is recommended that the advisor and student u nderstand each other's expectations and that effective means of communication are established. The advisor and student are encouraged to meet at appropriat e intervals to critically evaluate the student's progress. Th ese meetings may be reque sted by the student or the advisor. The advisor also has the obligation to express to the student any concerns he/she may have regarding the student's performance, to stipulate the level and quality of work expe cted, and to offer suggestions leading to student success. As such, the advisor neither gives the student excessive guidan ce nor allows the student to struggle needlessly. The goal of this relationship is to foster student independence, which results in successful completion of the program of study. Student's Program of Study In addition to the graduate degree program requirements as specified in the Graduate Catalog, each student should have a written, flexible program of study that includes the student's choice of Catalog year, choice of concentration, cognate, or other options available in the degree program, and a tentative identification of other appropriate choic es available to the student in the program, which may (but does not nee d to) include specific courses. A program of study is not a guarantee that specific courses will be available in a specific semester or that statutory and regulatory requirements will not change during the student's enrollment in the program. As required or appropriate, the prog ram of study should be revisited and modified by the student and the student's advisor/major professor(s). Electronic Signatures Where procedures described in this catalog require signatures, requirements for original signatures may be satisfied by University approved electronic signatures or other secure methods of verifying approval by advisors, major professors, committee members, or other University administrators, faculty, and staff. Assistantships Graduate Assistantships (GA), Research Assistantships (RA), and Teaching Assistantships (TA) Graduate Assistantships are intended to recruit quality students to graduate study at USF and to enhance the graduate learning experience. Graduate assistantships exist within academic departments or other university offices on campus. Graduate assistants may teach, conduct research, or perform other tasks that contrib ute to the student's professional development. Graduate students may be classified as Grad uate Assistants (GAs), Graduate Teaching Assistants/Associates (GTAs), Graduate Instructional Assistants (GIAs), and/or Graduate Research Assistants/Associates (GRAs). All graduate assistants at USF work under a contract negotiated by the Graduate Assistants United (GAU) and the USF Board of Trustees. The GAU is the labor union certified as the exclusive bargaining agent for graduate assistants at USF. Eligibility To receive an assistantship, the graduate student mus t meet the following eligibility requirements: Accepted in a graduate degree program; Maintain an overall minimum grade point average (GPA) and degree program GPA of 3.00; Enrolled fulltime during the semester(s) appointed as a gr aduate assistant. For Teaching Assistants, demonstrate proficiency in spoken English (if student is not from an English speaking country) USF Tampa Graduate Catalog 2013 2104 Section 7 Academic Policies and Regulations 39 Appointments Graduate Assistants may be appointed up to a maximum of 0.50 FTE for a single assistantship. Programs who desire to appoint a Graduate Student, in any classification, more than 0.50 FTE up to 0.75 FTE, for single or multiple appointments, must submit justification to the Office of Graduate Studies for approval. Stud ents hired in nonGA positions on campus must also not exceed 0.75 FTE for the combined position and assistantship appointments. It is preferre d th at students refrain from employment outside of the assistantship appointment. Departments may determine the maximum number of semesters for teaching assistantship appointments. Enrollment Fulltime enrollment is considered nine (9) graduate credit hours in the fall semester, nine (9) gr aduate credit hours in the spring semester, and six (6) graduate credit hours in the summer semester. If a graduate assistant is enrolled in the last semester of his/her program of study, the number of registered semester hours may be less than the fulltime requirement. Graduate assistants must comply with all Office of Graduate Studie s enrollment requirements to retain th eir assistantship as stated in the Graduate Catalog. For specifics regarding Graduate Assistantship requirements, guidelines, and policies, refer to the Graduate Assistants Policies and Guidelines Handbook Note Criminal History Background Chec ks may be required depending on the appointment reference USF Policy 0615 http://generalcounsel.usf.edu/policies andprocedures/pdfs/policy 0615.pdf Enrollment Requirements Students receiving Veterans' Administration benefits should confirm their enrollment requirements with the Office of Veterans' Services or Veterans' Coordinator. Minimum University Regulations USF FullTime Student Definition Students taking a minimum of nine (9) hours toward their degree in the fall or spring semester, or taking a minimum of six (6) hours in the summer semester, will be classified as FullTime students for academic purposes. Students may take a maximum of eighteen (18) hour s in any given semester; exceeding eighteen (18) hours requires a signed program of study or written approval from the College. For financial aid requirements, contact the Offic e of Financial Aid. Contin uous Enrollment fo r All Graduate Students All graduate degreeseeking students must be continuously enrolled. Continuous enrollment is defined as completing, with grades assigned, a minimum of 6 hours of graduate credit every three continuous semesters. Colleges and programs may have additional requirements. Students on an approve d leave of absence are not subject to the enrollment requirement for the time approved for the leave. Students who have bee n admitted to Doctoral Candidacy must follow the Dissertation Hour Enrollment in place of the Continuous Enrollment requirement as specified here for all graduate students (not in candidacy). See also the Time Limitatio ns Policy. Readmission Following Nonenrollment A graduate student who is not registered and enrolled for a minimum of six (6) credits in a 12 month period is automatically placed in nondegree seeking (i.e. inactive) status. Students must be readmitted to the degree program to continue their studies. Readmission is at the discretion of the prog ram and is not guaranteed. Refer to the Readmission Policy in the Graduate Admissions Section for more information. USF Tampa Graduate Catalog 2013 2104 Section 7 Academic Policies and Regulations 40 Enrollment during Comprehensive Exams and Admission to Candidacy During the term in which students take the comprehensive exams, students must be enrolled for a minimum of two (2) hours of graduate credit. If the exam is taken between semesters, the student must enroll for a minimum of two (2) hours of graduate credit in the semester before or following the exam. Students must also be enrolled for a minimum of two (2) hour s of gra duate work in the semester of admission to doctoral candidacy. Dissertation Hours Students working on a dissertation must enroll for a minimum of two (2) hours of dissertation every semester, starting with the semester following Admission to Doctoral Candidacy, up to and includ ing the semester the dissertation is submitted to and approved by the Office of Graduate Studies. Dissertation hours may apply to the Continuous Enrollment Requirement. Colleges and programs may have additional requirements. Students who are dropped from degreeseeking status and formally readmitted to the program must enroll in a minimum of 5 dissertation hours in the sem ester that the readmission is effective. Refer to the Readmission Policy in the Graduate Admissions Section for more information. Enrollment during Semester of Thesis Submission Students must be enrolled for a minimum of two (2) thesis hours during the semester that the thesis is submitte d and approved by the Office of Graduate Studies, usually the semester of graduation. Student s not enrolled for the minimum requirement will not have the thesis/dissertation approved and therefore may not be certified for graduation. Enrollme nt during Semester of Graduation Students must be enrolled for a minimum of two (2) graduate hours during the semester of graduation. Enrollment for Graduate Teaching and Research Assistants Graduate Teaching and Research Assistants should be fulltime students. Exceptions must be approved by the College Dean and the Dean of the Office of Graduate Studies. Leaves of Absence (LO A) Leaves of absence may be granted to students under exceptional and unavoidable circumstances. Students requesting a LOA must specify the reasons for the leave, as well as the duration. Requested LOA may be approved for up to two years. Students requiring less than three (3) consec utive terms of absence do not need an approved LOA if they meet the continuous enrollment requirement. Students with an approved LOA must be enrolled in the first semester after the leave expires. To request an LOA, the student must complete the form available from the Office of Graduate Studies website. The LOA must be approved by the Major Professor, the Program, the College, and the Office of Graduate Studies, and is noted in the studen t's record. If the LOA is granted, the time absent does not count against the student's time limit to obtain the degree. Students returning from an approved LOA must reactivate their status by contac ting the Office of Graduate Studies for procedures. Doctoral candidates returning from a LOA must also have their candidacy status reactivated. USF Tampa Graduate Catalog 2013 2104 Section 7 Academic Policies and Regulations 41 Academic Standards and Grades Minimum University Requirements In Good Standing To be considered a student in good standing, graduate students must Maintain an overall minimum grade point average (GPA) of 3.00 (on a 4.00 scale) in all courses taken as a graduate student, and Maintain an overall minimum grade point average (GPA) of 3.00 (on a 4.00 scale) in all courses taken in each of th e student's degreeseeking programs. No grade of C or below will be accepted toward a graduate degree. Students must meet the requirements to be in good standing to graduate. All \"I\" and \"M\" grades must be cleared for graduation to be certified. Students who fail to maintain good standing ma y be placed on probation or academically dismissed. Grade Point Average (GPA) The GPA is computed by dividing the total number of quality points by the total number of graded (AF) hours completed. The total quality points are figured by multiplying the number of credits assigned to each course by the quality poin t value of the grade given. The GPA is truncated to two decimals (3.48) and is not rounded up. Credit hours for courses with grades of I, IU, M, MU, N, S, U, W, Z and grades which are preceded by T (Transfer) are subtra cte d from the total hours attempted before the GPA is calculated. Graduate students are not eligible for grade forgiveness. All grades earned, regardless of course level, will be posted on the transcript. If a student retakes a course, both grades will be used in the determination of the GPA. Courses taken at USF as nondegree seeking are not compu ted in the GPA unless the courses are transferred in and applied to the degree requirements. The program and the college must approve such actions. Grades for transfer credits accepted toward the degree progr a m will not be counted in the GPA unless the coursework in question was taken as a nondegreeseeking student at USF and meets the requirements stated above (see Institution Based Credit/Transfer of Credit section). Graduate Grading System Plus/Minus Grading: Effective fall semester 2000, graduate and under graduate grades will be assigned quali ty points in the Grade Point Avera g e (GPA) grading system. The +/ designation must be included in the syllabus provided at the beginning of the course. The use of the +/ grading system is at the discretion of the instructor. The syllabus policy is available in the office of the Provost. Letter grade = number of grad e points A 4.00 A 3.67 B+ 3.33 B D+ 1.33 USF Tampa Graduate Catalog 2013 2104 Section 7 Academic Policies and Regulations 42 D 1.00 D .67 F 0.00 FF Failure due to academic dishonesty2 CF Cancelled Financially (Course was cancelled due to financial reasons) CMU Cancelled, Missing Grade that has turned to a \"U\" IA Incomplete, grade points not applicable IB Incomplete, grade points not applicable IC Incomplete, grade points not applicable ID Incomplete, grade points not applicable IF Incomplete, grade points not applicable* M Missing grade /no grade report ed by in structor, grade points not applicable N Audit, grade points not applicable S/U Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory, grade points not applicable W Withdrawal or drop from course without penalty, grade points not applicable Z Continuing registration in multisemester internship or Thesis/Dissertation courses, grade points not applicable *Incomplete grade policy change effective fall 08. IF grades earn ed and posted prior to fall 2008 do calculate in the GPA; IF grades earned as of fall 2008 forward do not calculate in the GPA refer to Incomplete Grade Policy for more information. Satisfactory (S)/ Unsatisfactory (U) Graduate students may not take courses in the major on an S/U (satisfactory / unsatisfactory) basis unless courses are specifically designated S/U in the Catalog. Studen t s may take courses outside of the major on an S/U basis with prior approval of the course professor, major professor or advisor, and the Dean of the College in which the stude nt is seeking a degree. The student may apply a maximum of six (6) hours of such credit (excluding those courses for which S/U is designated in the Catalog) toward a master's degree. Directed Research, Thesis, and Dissertation courses are designated as variable credit and are graded on an S/U basis only. Before a student begins work u nder Directed Research, a written agreement must be completed between the student and the professor concerned, setting forth in detail the requirements of the course. Incomplete (I) Definition: An Incomplete grade (\"I\") is exceptional and granted at the instructor's discretion only when studen ts are unable to complete course requirements due to illness or other circumstances beyond their control. This applies to all gr adable courses, including pass/fail (S/U). Students may only be eligible for an \"I\" when: majority of the student's work for a course has been completed before the end of the semester the work that has been completed must be qualitatively satisfactory the student has requested consideration for an \"I\" grade as soon as possible but no later than the last day of finals week. The student must request consideration for an Incomplete grade and obtain an \"I\" Grade Contract from the instructor of record. Even though the student may meet the eligibility requirements for this grade, the course instructor retains the right to make the final decision on granting a student's request for an Incomplete. The course instructor and student must complet e and sign the \"I\" Grade Contract Form that describes the work to 2 Graduate Students who receive an FF will be academically dismissed from the University and will not be eligible to apply to any graduate program at USF. See section on Academic Dishonesty and Graduate Studies Policy on Academic Integrity for more information. USF Tampa Graduate Catalog 2013 2104 Section 7 Academic Policies and Regulations 43 be completed, the date it is due, and the grade the student would earn factoring in a zero for all incomplete assignments. The due date can be negotiated and extended by student/instructor as long as it does not exceed one semester from the original date grades were due for that course. The instructor must file a copy of the \"I\" Grade Contract in the depart ment that offered the course and the Office of Graduate Studies by the date grades are due. The instructor must not require students to either re register for the course or audit the course in order to complete the \"I\" grade. Students may register to audit the course, with the instructor's appr oval, but cannot retake the course for credit until the I grade is cleared. An I grade not cleared within the next academic semester (including summer semester) will revert to the grade noted on the contra ct. I grades are not computed in the GPA, but the grad e noted on the contract will be computed in the GPA, retroactive to the semester the course was taken, if the contract is not fulfilled by the specified date. When the final grade is assigned, if applicable, the student will be place d on academic probation or academically dismissed (refer to Automated Academic Probation Proc edures for information). Students cannot be admitted to doctoral candidacy or certified for graduation with an \"I\" grade. Example: Current Semester student has a \"B\" in the course, not including the grade for the missing assignment, therefore is eligible for an \"I\" student's grade, including a zero for the missed work, would be an \"D\" studen t and instructor complete the \"I\" Grade Contract, assigning an \"ID\" (Incomplete +D grade) Deadline Agreed Upon in Contract (e.g. two weeks)* If the student completes the work as agreed upon in the Contract by the noted deadli ne the instr uctor of record will submit a change of grade in egrades student earns final grade comprised of all completed course work If the student does not complete the work as agreed upon in the Contract by the note d deadline \"I\" automatically drops off and the grade of \"D\" remains. GPA is recalculated for the current semester and retroactively recalculated for the semester in which the \"I \" was granted. *Although the instructor establishes the deadline for completion of the work, the deadline may only extend through the end of the subseq uent semest e r. Missing (M) The University policy is to issue an M grade automatically when the instructor does not submit any grade for a graduate student. Until it is removed, the M is not computed in the GPA. To resolve the missing grade, students receiving an M grade must conta ct their instructor. If the instructor is not available, the st udent must contact the instructor's department chair. Courses with an M grade may not be applied to the degree program requirements. Students with an M grade will not be admitted to doctoral candidacy until the M grade is resolved. Continuing Registration Grades (Z) The Z grade shall be used to indicate continuing registration in multi semester internship or thesis/dissertation courses where the final grade to be assigned will indicate the complete sequence of courses or satisfactory completion of the thesis/dissertation. Upon satisfactory completion of a multi semester internship or thesis/dissertation, the final grade assigned will be an S. The Office of Graduate Studies submits the change of USF Tampa Graduate Catalog 2013 2104 Section 7 Academic Policies and Regulations 44 grade for the last registration of thesis/dissertation courses once the thesis/dissertation has been accepted for publication. Note: Graduation will not be certified until all courses have been satisfactorily completed. No grade changes will be processed after the student has graduated except in the case of university error. Procedures requiring petitions are processed through the Office of Graduate Stu dies. Probation Any student who is not in good standing at the end of a semester shall be considered on probation as of the following semester. The college or program may also place students on probation for other reasons as designated by the college or program. Notificatio n of probation shall be made to the student in writing by the department, with a copy to the College Dean. At the end of each prob ationary semester, the department shall recommend, in writing, to the College Dean one of the following: 1. Removal of probation 2. Continued prob ation; OR 3. Dismissal from the degree program. Students with a GPA below 3.00 for two consecutive semesters will be prevented fr om registering for courses without the permission of the College Dean. The College Dean will notify the Dean of the Office of Graduate Studies in cases of academic dismissal. To be readmitted, the student will need to reapply for admission, meeting the admission criteria in place at the time. For information on the Automated Probation Process go to http:// www.grad.usf.edu/ inc/linked files/Catalog%20and%20Policies/2012_2013/Policies/Au tomating_Academic_Probation_with_Examples_updated_ 10_24_12.pdf Voluntary Withdrawal A student may withdraw from the university without grade penalty by the University deadline. Information on the different types of withdrawal (i.e., withdrawing from a single class - see the Drop section, an entire semester, or from the degree program itself) can be obtained from the Registrar's Office. Appropriate alterna tive calendar dates may apply. Stude nts wh o withdraw may not continue to attend classes. Transfer of Credit Students may, with the approval of their graduate degree program, transfer credits from any regionally accredited institution into their graduate degree program, as long as the majority of the credits are earned at the institution granting the degree. Credits obtained from USF System Institutions will be calc ulated into the GPA at USF and will be noted on the transcript as the grade earned. Credits from other regionally accredited universities are not calculated into the GPA at USF. Only credits with a grade of B or better may be transferred. Credit for coursework expires seven (7) years after receiving the cre dit. There is no time limitation for courses from a completed master's degree or professional degree applied toward a doctoral degree. The graduate degree program / department will be responsible for evaluating, approving, and initiating the transfer as soon as possible at th e time of admission. Note Students taking courses at USF System Institutions other than their home USF institution should seek the approval of their graduate program director prior to taking the courses to ensure that the courses are eligible for transfer.

USF Tampa Graduate Catalog 2013 2104 Section 7 Academic Policies and Regulations 46 Change of Graduate Degree Program See Change of Graduate Program in the Admissions Section. Accelerated Program Guidelines Programs who desire to offer Accelerated Degree Programs must establish guidelines that define the following. The guidelines must then be submitted and approved by the Policy Committee of the Graduate Council. These guidelines are used in the development of a new Accelerated Program. For Departments Developing an Accelerated Program: Proposed Programs must meet the Accelerated Program Requirements, as well as follow the best practices listed below: Programs have a choice of conferring degrees simultaneously or sequentially, but it is recommended that undergraduate degrees are to be conferred in a timely manner as soon as undergraduate requirements are fulfilled. Programs must complete a Prog ram of Study, dev elop a plan for academic advising, and tracking of students, including notation of potential financial aid impact. Typically, up to twelve (12) hours of graduate credit may be shared between the graduate and undergraduate degree. Although, with Graduate Council and Office of Graduate Studies approval, programs may offer accelerated programs with more shared cred its. Typically, a minimum undergraduate GPA of at least 3.33 overall and a minimum GPA of 3.50 in the major, having taken a minimum of 15 hours in the undergraduate major are required for students to be admitted to an accelerated program. With Graduate Council and Office of Graduate Studies approval, programs may offer accelerated programs with different GPA requirements. Students must have a minimum of a \"B\" (3.00) in each graduate course. Consequences for not obtaining a \"B\" in each graduate course must be noted in the Departmental Accelerated Progr am requirements. Following completion of a minimum of 15 hours in the undergraduate major, the student may be considered for acceptance into the Accelerated Degree program in one of two ways: faculty nomination or student selfnomination, via submission of the Accelerated Graduate Program Nomination Form. Programs will review the applications and approve the nomination. Programs will submit the required paperwork (Accelerated Graduate Program Admission Form ) to officially convert the student to graduate standing, no later than when the student has reached 90 hours or Bachelor's degree has been conferred. The application requires approval from the Graduate Program, College, and Office of Graduate Studies. What Departments will submit for Curriculum Approval and catalog copy: ACADEMIC INFORMATION (Catalog Copy): Accelerated Program Requirements Accelerated Programs allow academically qualified students to complete an undergraduate Bachelor's degree and a graduate master's degree on an accelerated timeline, graduating sooner than in traditional programs. USF Tampa Graduate Catalog 2013 2104 Section 7 Academic Policies and Regulations 47 Admission Requirements Admission into an Accelerated Program is accomplished in one of two ways: 1) Faculty Nomination 2) Student SelfApplication To be eligible for consideration for an Accelerated Program, students must: Have completed a minimum of 15 undergraduate hours in the major Have a minimum undergraduate GPA of 3.33 overall Have a minimum undergraduate GPA of 3.50 in the major Accelerated Degree Program Academic Requirements Each Program will indicate the specific academic requirements, including the up to 12 hours of shared coursework between the undergraduate and graduate degrees. Undergraduate Degree Requirements specify Shared Requirements specify Graduate Degree Requirements specify Accelerated Program Information for Students: Accelerated Programs allow academically qualified students to complete an undergraduate Bachelor's degree and a graduate degree (typically master's degree) on an accelerated timeline, graduating sooner than in traditional programs. Typically students will complete a portion of the required graduate coursework while classified as an undergraduate student and have it count towards both degrees. As soon as the student comp letes the under graduate degree requirements, the student is converted to graduate status, where the remaining graduate requirements are fulfilled. Students interested in pursuing an Accelerated Program must complete an Accelerated Program Application (http://www.grad.usf.edu/inc/linked files/Accelerated_Program_Application.pdf ). Editor's Note: Although students may be in an Accelerated Program, pursuing a Bachelor's and Master's Degree at the same time, they cannot be in two levels at once. Dual Degree Designation A student may pursue two graduate degrees at USF through a formal, approved Dual Degree Designation. The goal is for a student to attain two graduate degrees. (Students pursuing a combined bachelor's and graduate degree are considered to be in an Accelerated Program see catalog section for information on this separate process.) A Dual Degree designatio n is required for a student pursuing two separate graduate degrees. Either through an established relationship between two degree programs (see 1 below) or through an individualized designation (see 2 below), between 0% and 15% of the total combined credit hours for the two degree programs may be shared, with Department (or equivalent), College, and Office of Graduate Studies approval. With the exception of shared coursework, all other separate degree requirements must be success fully met (e.g. two dissertations, one thesis/one dissertation, projects, exams, etc.), unless approved by Graduate Council. (Note: where a single degree is preferred, refer to the Interdisciplinary Degree Program information below). Example: A student is enrolled in two master's degree programs requiring theses and 30 credits minimum each. With approval, the student may share 9 hours (equal to or less than 15%) across the combined 60 total minimum credit hours required. The student would also complete two separate theses. Once the degree requirements are successfully completed, the degrees may be conferred concurrently or sequentially. However, both degrees must be conferred within the timelimit for the first degree to which the student is admitted. USF Tampa Graduate Catalog 2013 2104 Section 7 Academic Policies and Regulations 48 Application for Dual Degree Designation Procedures for applying for Dual Degree Designation are available on the Office of Graduate Studies website. Advising and approval of a Dual Degree Designation Dual Degree Designation may be developed in the following ways: 1) an established relationship between two degree programs formulated through the Department(s) and then formalized through the College(s), Office of Graduate Studies, and Graduate Council. A current list of formalized programs with Dual Degree designation may be found in the Graduate Catalog. 2) formulated by an individual student who is intereste d in pursuing two degree programs that are not cur rently a formalized relationship with Dual Degree Designation. Students must request from both programs of interest approval to pursue Dual Degree Designation with those programs. For procedures and the necessary forms, refer to the Office of Graduate Studies website. Note: when a Program has this occur more than three times, the Program should follow the process to formalize that Dual Degree Designation. Interdisciplinary Degree Programs A student may pursue a single graduate degree that spans several academic areas. An Interdisciplinary Degree Program - is defined as a student pursuing a single standalone graduate degree, which is offered across two or more graduate degree programs. (Note: where two separate degrees are preferred, refer to the Dual Degree Program information above). Application to an Interdisciplinary Degree Program Students interested in applying for admission to an Interdisciplinary Degree Program follow the established University, College, and Program admission requirements - refer to the Office of Graduate Studies website for specific information for that particular program. Development of an Interdisciplinary Degree Program Interdisciplinary Degree Programs are formalized through the College, Office of Graduate Studies, and Graduate Council and must follow the University requirements for new degree program development, including notation on the Workplan. Procedures for developing an Interdisciplinary Degree Program are available on the Office of Graduate Studies website. For information contact the Office of Graduate Studies. OffCampus Courses and Programs Graduate courses and programs are offered at locations other than the Tampa, Sarasota, St. Petersburg, and Lakeland campuses. Information on course enrollment procedures for offcampus courses and programs may be obtained from the College in which the courses or programs are offered. USF Tampa Graduate Catalog 2013 2014 Section 8 University Degree Requirements 49 Section 8 University Degree Requirements Degree Requirements The following sections describe the University requirements established by the Office of Graduate Studies for the Master's, Education Specialist, and Doctoral degrees. However, individual programs and colleges may establish additional or more stringent requirements. Student Responsibilities The University of South Florida and all colleges, departments and programs therein establish certain academic requirements that must be met before a degree is granted. These requirements concern such things as curricula and courses, majors and minors, and academic residence. Faculty and graduate program directors are available to help the student understand and arrange to meet these requirements, but the student is responsible for fulfilling them. At the end of a student's course of study, if all requirements for graduation have not been satisfied, the degree will not be granted. For this reason, it is important for students to acquaint themselves with all regulations and to remain currently informed throu g hout their college careers. Courses, programs, and requirements described in the catalog may be suspended, deleted, restricted, supplemented, or changed in any other manner at any time at the sole discretion of the University and the USF Board of Trustees. Graduate Faculty Definition The University of South Florida recognizes Graduate Faculty and Affiliate Graduate Faculty. Graduate Faculty is defined to consist of all tenuretrack or tenured faculty appointed at the Assistant, Associate, or Professor rank, who hold a terminal degree or equivalent in their discipline. Graduate Faculty members are eligible to teach graduate courses and may direct and serve on masters, specialist, and doctoral level committees. To chair a doctoral level committee, a Graduate Faculty member must engage in current and sustained scholarly, creative, or research activities, such as publications, performances, exhibitions, patents, inventions and research grants. Affiliate Graduate Faculty membership may be granted by the Office of Graduat e Studies Dean to individuals whose skills or expertise meet criteria established by the College. Affiliate Graduate Faculty membership is in effect for a specified period of time and specific purposes. Affiliate members may be eligible to teach graduate courses, to serve on master's, specialist, and doctoral level committees, USF Tampa Graduate Catalog 2013 2014 Section 8 University Degree Requirements 50 to direct master's and specialist's level committees, and to codirect doctoral level committees, at the discretion of the College. Emeritus Professors and retired or recently resigned professors may also be appointed as Affiliate Graduate Faculty with the approval of the College and Office of Graduate Studies Dean. Graduate Faculty Approval - Graduate faculty is define d as noted above; Colleges and Depar tments may have additional requirements. The Office of Graduate Studies will maintain a list of Graduate Faculty along with approval guidelines from the Colleges and Departments. For a current list of Graduate Faculty and Affiliate Graduate Faculty in any program contact the program director or coordinator. Also see Sec tion 3 Faculty and Research Interests. Master's Degree Requirements Minimum Hours A minimum of thirty (30) hours is required for a master's degree, at least sixteen (16) hours of which must be at the 6000 level. At least twenty (20) hours must be in formal, regularly scheduled course work, ten (10) of which must be at the 6000 level. Up to six (6) hours of 4000 leve l courses may be taken as part of a planned degree program. Additional graduate credit may be earned in 4000 level courses only if specifically approved by the appropriate College Dean. Lower level undergraduate course may not be used to satisfy master's course requirements but may be taken to meet specific prerequisites. Students enrolled in undergrad u ate courses as part of a planned degree program are expected to demonstrate a superior level of performance in these courses. All graduate and undergraduate courses taken as a graduate student count in the overall GPA, whether or not they count toward the minimum hours for the degree. Graduate students may not enroll for more than 18 hours in any semester without written permission from the College Dean. Institutional Enrollment Requirement The majority of credits toward a graduate degree must be earned through instruction offered by the home institution (e.g., USF Tampa, USF St. Petersburg, USF SarasotaManate e) gra nting the degree. For information about the minimum number of credit hours required for the degree refer to the degree requirements in the program listing. Students are responsible for consulting with their degree program coordinator for information on courses that may be taken outside their gradu ate degree program, as well as the Transfer of Credit Policy for course transfe r eligibility requirements. Although equivalent courses may be offered at other institutions (including within the USF System), they may not satisfy degree requirements. Time Limitations Master's and Ed.S. degrees must be completed within five (5) years from the student's date of admission for graduate study. Courses taken prior to admission to the USF graduate program, for example as nondegree seeking or from other institutions that were transferred in, can be no older than seven years at the time of graduation. Master and Ed.S. degrees (including dual degree programs) that require course work in excess of 50 credit hours may be granted a longer statute of limitations by the University Graduate Council. Time Limit Extensions In the event that a student nears the end of the time limitation as specified above, but the student needs more time to complete the degree, the student may submit a request for an extension using the Time Limit Extensio n Request Form, available on the Office of Graduate Studies website http://www.grad.usf.edu/student forms.php Requests must include the reasons for the delay in completion, the anticipated time needed for completion, USF Tampa Graduate Catalog 2013 2014 Section 8 University Degree Requirements 51 and endorsements from the graduate faculty advisor, graduate program, and College Dean or designee, a detailed plan of study and timeline for the remaining requirements for the degree prior to submission to the Office of Graduate Studies for approval. (Editor's note - for the time limit extension procedures, if the time limit extension will cause cou rses taken or transferred into the program to be older than 7 years, then a request for course concurrency may be required or the courses may be invalidated toward the degree requirements, per the time limit policy) If approved, the time limit extension also applies to courses applied toward the degree. However, programs may require additional or repeat coursework as part of the condition of the time limit extension. Students who exceed the time limitations may have their registration placed on hold until a request for extension has been approved. Only one time limit extension request is permitted. Studen ts who are temporarily unable to continue the program should submit a Leave of Absence Request, which extends the time limit for the duration of the approved Leave (see the section on Leave of Absence in the Enrollment Requirements section.). Enrollment Requirements Refer to the Academic Policies Section Major Professor The Major Professor serves as the student 's advisor and mentor. Studen ts should co nfer with the department to confirm the internal process and timeline for the selection and appointment of the Major Professor. The student must identify a major professor and receive that person's agreement to serve as major professor. The selection of the Major Professor must be approved and appoin ted by th e department as soon as possible, but no later than the time the student has completed 50% of the program. Students must have a major professor in order to maintain Satisfactory Academic Progress. If a major professor cannot be identified or in the event a major professor is unable or unwilling to conti n ue serving on the student's committee, the student is responsible for finding another major professor. Students who are unable to find a replacement major professor should confer with the Program Director for available options (includi ng converting to a nonthesis progra m if available .) If no other options exist the student may be requested to voluntarily withdraw from the program or may be honorably withdrawn in good academic standing. The student and major professor should plan a program of study which, when completed, will satisfy the degree requirements specified. A copy of this program, signed by the student and professor, must be maintained in the student's department file. Major Professors must meet the following requirements: Be graduate faculty, as defined by the University. Faculty who do not meet this definition may serve as CoMajor Professor with faculty who do. Be engaged in current and sustained scholarly, creative, or research activities and have met departmental (or equivalent) requirements. Have been approved by the Department Chair (or equiva lent) to serve as a Major Professor or CoMajor Professor. The membership of graduate faculty will be based upon criteria developed within the appropriate program or department and approved at the college level. These criteria must be forwarded to the Dean of the Office of Graduate Studies. In the event a Major Professor leaves the University (i.e., for an appointment at another university, due to retirement, etc.) and the Major Professor is willing to continue serving on the student's committee, the Major USF Tampa Graduate Catalog 2013 2014 Section 8 University Degree Requirements 52 Professor then becomes a CoMajor Professor on the committee and another faculty is appointed as the other Co Major Professor. It is important that one of the CoMajor Professors be accessible on the university campus for the student to make satisfactory progress on the thesis/dissertation. In the event a Major Professor is on temporary leave (e.g. sabbatical, resear ch, etc.); the Major Professor shall coordinate with the Program Direc tor to facilitate the needs of the student. In some instances a student may choose to have two professors serve as Major Professor. In this situation the faculty are approved as \"CoMajor Professors\" and jointly serve in that role. Consequ ently both faculty must sign approval on paperwork pertaining to the student's processing (i.e. committee form, change of committee form, etc.) Appointment of a (Co)Major Professor(s) may be rescinded by the Department Chair (or equivalent), with the approval of the appropriate Department (or equivalen t) faculty committee (separate from student advisory committee.) (Co) Major Profes sor( s) of the Graduate Student Supervisory Committee Responsibilities Available on the Office of Graduate Studies Website: http://www.grad.usf.edu/policies.php Thesis Committee Students working toward a thesis degree will have the benefit of a committee of members of the graduate faculty. The committee will approve the course of study for the student and plan for research, supervise the research and any comprehensive qualifying exams, and read and approve the thesis for content and format. Composition The committee will consist of the major professor and at least two othe r members or comajor professors and at least one other member of the department or area of interest in which the degree is sought. (Colleges and Programs may require additional committee members and specify characteristics.) Member Definition All graduate faculty, as defined by the University and the College/Department, and approved by their departme nt and college, are assumed by the Office of Graduate Studies as qualified to be a member of and/or supervise a committee. Persons desiring to serve on a Graduate committee who are not define d as Graduate Faculty (i.e. visiting faculty, professionals, etc.) by the Universi ty and the College/Departm ent must submit a curriculum vitae (CV) and be approved by the Department, College, and, as needed, the Office of Graduate Studies, for each committee. Committee members must meet the following requirements: Be graduate or affiliate graduate facult y, as defined by the University Have the background and expertise that contributes to the success of the student. In addition to the requirements specified in the Graduate Faculty definition, committee membership will be based upon criteria developed within the appropriate program or department and approved at the college level. These criteria must be forwarded to the Dean of th e Office of Graduate Studies. Approval Once a committee has been determined, a Supervisory Committee Form needs to be completed by the student and submitted to the Committee Members for original signatures. Check with the College for instructions and forms. The original appoi ntment form and two (2) copies should be submitted to the College Associ ate Dea n's office for approval. A copy of the approved form should be kept in the student's file. An approved and current Committee Form must be on file in the program/college before graduation may be certified. Committee forms need to be processed as early in the program as possible, but no later than the semester prior to graduation. (Colle ges and depa rtments may institute additional requirements for membership on Supervisory Committees.) USF Tampa Graduate Catalog 2013 2014 Section 8 University Degree Requirements 53 Changes to Committee Changes to a Supervisory Committee must be submitted on a Change of Committee Form. Check with the College for instructions and forms. Original signatures of faculty being added to the Committee, along with the approval signature of the (Co) Major Professor(s), must be on the form. Faxed signatur es are acceptable. Faculty who are removed from the Committee are not re quired to sign the form, provided that the (Co) Major Professor(s) has signed. In such instances the signature of the (Co) Major Professor(s) indicate(s) approval of the change, as well as acknowledgement and approval of the change by the removed member. Any nonfacult y being added to a committee must submit a Curriculum Vitae (CV) for college approval. Change of Committee Forms should be submitted for approval as soon as the change takes place. Changes to a Committee are official only once approved and filed by the program and college. Masters Comprehensive Exam ination Prior to clearance for the degree, candidates must perform satisfactorily on a comprehensive examination or an alternative method designated by the academic unit to measure student competency in the major area. Students must be enrolled for a minimum of two (2) hours of graduate credit during the semester when the comprehensive examination is taken. If the exam is taken between semes ters, the student must be enrolled for a minimum of two (2) hours of graduate credit in the semester before or following the exam. Thesis If a thesis is required, it must conform to the guidelines of the University. Refer to the Thesis and Dissertation Guidelines, available on the web at http://www.grad.usf.edu/ETD resmain.php for complete information about requirements, procedures, and deadlines. For enrollment requirements, refer to the Academic Policies section in the Catalog. Format The Thesis must conform to one of two formats: Option 1 - a traditional format 3 inclusive of: Part I: Preliminary Pages Title Page Dedication (optional page) Acknowledgments (optional page) Table of Contents List of Tables (if applicable) List of Figures (if applicable) Abstract Part II: Text (divided by chapter or section headings) Part III: References / Bibliography Appendix Sections and copyright permission (if applicable) About the Author (optional page) 3 Deviations from the available format are acceptable if approved in advance by the Supervisory Committee and Office of Graduate Studies.

Manuscript Processing Fee USF Regulation USF40107, http://generalcounsel.usf.ed u/regulations/pdfs/regulation usf4.0107.pdf Students participating in the thesis/dissertation process are required to pay a processing fee. More information is available on the Thesis and Dissertation website. Exchange of Thesis for Non Thesis Credit If a student changes from thesis to nonthesis during a semester and is currently enrolled in thesis credit, the current thesis credits may be excha nged without academic penalty if a Office of Graduate S tudies Petition is filed with the Office of Graduate Studies no later than the last day to withdraw without Academic Penalty. If a student enrolled in a thesis required program has taken thesis credits but elects to change to nonthesis track or program, the accumulated thesis credits may not be exchan ge d or converted to another nonstructured credit. The thesis hours will remain on the transcript and will retain the \"Z\" grade. Thesis Defense Policies and procedures for the thesis defense are handled within the College and Program. Cont act the College and Program for requirements. Thesis Final Submission Guidelines Information on requirements for submission of the finished and approved manuscript copies is available online at the Thesis and Dissertation website http://www.grad.usf.edu/ETD resmain.php . Students who fail to submit the final copy of a thesis by the posted submission deadline will be considered for graduation in the following semester and must therefore apply for graduation by the posted deadline, enroll in a minimum of two (2) thesis hours for that subsequent semester, and meet the submission requirements as posted on the Thesis/Dissertation website. Only after the Office of Graduate Studies has approved the manuscript can the studen t be cer tified for the degree. USF Tampa Graduate Catalog 2013 2014 Section 8 University Degree Requirements 55 Mandatory Electronic Submission Students are required to submit the thesis in an electronic format (ETD). Requirements and procedures are available at the Office of Graduate Studies website http://www.grad.usf.edu/ETD resmain.php Submission for Official Publication and Archiving All theses/dissertations will be submitted to the Office of Graduate Studies designated System for official publication and archiving. Changes after Publication Once a thesis is approved and accepted by the Office of Graduate Studies for publication, it cannot be changed. Release of Thesis Publications The University recognizes the benefits from collaboration with sponsors on research projects but also recognizes the possibility of conflicts of interest in the disclosure of the results of the collaborations. While the sponsor's economic interests in the restriction of disclosure should be considered, the University has a primary mission to extend knowledge and disseminate it to the public and the broader academic community. The University's \"Statement of Policy Regarding Inventions and Works\" acknowledges the possible need for delays in publication of sponsored researc h to pro tect the sponsor's interests, but it provides no definite guidelines for the restrictions of publication beyond the statement: \"Disclosure delays mutually acceptable to the Inventor, the Vice President for Research, and the sponsor, if any, are authorized in order to allow patent applications to be filled prior to publication, thereby preser ving patent rights...\"4 To protect the University's primary goal from undue compromise, the University has adopted the following guidelines: 1. The recommendations of sponsors, regarding publication of research results should be considered advisory rather than mandatory. 2. In support of academic discourse and the mission to promote and share academic works, Theses will be releas ed for worldwide access once submitted to and approved by the USF Office of Graduate Stud ies. In the event that a patent or copyright application provides reason to delay the release of the Thesis, a petition to request a one year delay may be submitted to the Office of Graduate Studies for consideration. Such requests must be re ceived by the format check of the thesis. 3. Students should not be delayed in the final defense of their theses by agreements involving publication delays. 4 April Burke, \"University Policies on Conflict of Interest and Delay of Publications,\" Report of the Clearinghouse on University Industry Relations, Association of American Universities, February, 1985.

Thesis Change of Grade In the semester in which the final manuscript has been received, reviewed, and certified for permanent filing in the University Library, the Office of Graduate Studies submits the chan ge of grade from \"Z\" to \"S\" for the last registration of thesis courses to the office of the registrar when all grades are due at th e end of the semester. Education Specialist Degree (Ed.S.) Requirements Ed.S. Thesis Students who are required to submit an Ed.S. Thesis must meet all of the requirements for the thesis, as specified in the Master's Degree section of this publication. For specific degree program information, refer to the College of Education. Ed.S. Project Students who are required to submit an Ed.S. NonThesis project must meet all of the requirements as specified by the College of Educatio n. A projec t does not need to meet the requirements of a thesis and is not submitted to the Office of Graduate Studies for approval and archiving. Doctoral Degree Requirements The doctoral degree is granted in recognition of high attainment in a specific field of knowledge. It is a research degree and is not conferred solely upon the earning of credit, the completion of courses, or the acquiring of a number of terms of residency, but also the successful completion of scholarly work. The length of residency and the requireme nts below are minimums; programs/colleges may elect to establish more rigorous requirements. The degree will be granted after th e student has shown proficiency and distinctive achievement in a specified field, has demonstrated the ability to do original, independent investigation, and has presented these findings with a high degree of literary skill in a dissertation. A major professor will be appointed as soon as possible but no later than the time the student has completed 50% of the program. The advisor will advise on any specific subject matter deficiencies and assist in the choice of a major professor and area of research. Responsib l e Conduct of Research Responsible Conduct of Research (RCR) is a critical element in training for scholarship. USF has information about RCR available online at: www.grad.usf.edu/rcr.php Effective Spring 2013, Office of Graduate Studies requires all new doctoral students to have basic RCR training by completing the Collaborative Institutional Training Initiative (CITI) module most relevant to the student's program of study. The CITI modules have been designed to introduce researchers to various elements of research conduct ranging from research misconduct to data management to mentoring. As this is a minimum require ment, s pecific doctoral programs may require training that goes beyond the basic components introduced in this module. Graduate Programs that have received Office of Graduate Studies approval for rigorous RCR training consistent USF Tampa Graduate Catalog 2013 2014 Section 8 University Degree Requirements 57 with disciplinary standards and practices may exempt their students from the CITI requirement. Students must complete the module, or provide evidence of previous qualified RCR training to their Program Director and Office of Graduate Studies, in the first semester enrolled in a doctoral program. Previous RCR training should have been completed within the past year. Students will be unable to register for courses in a future semester until successful fulfillment of th is RCR requirement. Once the training is completed, the Registration hold will be lifted. Doctoral Minimum Hours Because the doctoral degree is earned on the basis of advancement to doctoral candidacy status and satisfactory completion of the dissertation, the Office of Graduate Studies does not specify any mini mum number of courses or credit hours that must be completed for award of the degree. However, programs with formally approved concentrations must have core major requirements that all students must successfully complete. Students must comply with general enrollment requirements and also institutional residency requirements. All doctoral students must have at least one gr adable (AF) graduate course taken at USF to satisfy the GPA minimum requirements. Up to six (6) hours of 4000level courses may be taken as part of a planned degree program. Additional graduate credit may be earned in 4000 level courses only if specifically approved by the appropriate College Dean. Lower level undergraduate course may not be used to satisfy doctoral course requirements but may be taken to meet specific prerequisites. Students enrolled in undergraduate courses as part of a planned graduate degree program are expected to demonstrate a superior level of performance in th ese courses. All graduate and undergraduate courses taken as a graduate student count in the overall GPA, whether or not they count toward the minimum hours for the degree. No undergraduate course may be used to satisfy the gradable minimal course requirement for the doctoral degree. Time Limitatio n s Doctoral degrees must be completed within seven (7) years from the student's original date of admission for doctoral study. All courses applied to the doctoral degree must be completed within seven (7) years, including courses taken 1) prior to admission to the USF doctoral program, 2) taken as nondegree seeking, or 3) transferred in fro m other institutions. There is no time limitation for courses from a completed master's degree used toward a doctoral degree. For students who are readmitted, see Readmission Policy. Typically a student will reach candidacy within four years, but this may vary per discipline. Time Limi t Extensions In the event that a student nears the end of the time limitation as specified above, but the student needs more time to complete the degree, the student may submit a request for an extension using the Time Limit Extension Request Form, available on the Offi ce of Graduate Studies website http://www.grad.usf.edu/student forms.php . Requests must include the reasons for the delay in completion, the anticipated time needed for completion, and endorsements from the graduate faculty advisor, graduate program, and College Dean or designee, a detailed plan of study and timeline for the remaining requirements for the degree Prior to submission to the Office of Graduate Studies for approval. If approved, the time limit extension also applies to courses applied toward the degree. However, programs may require additional or repeat coursework as part of the condition of the time limit extension. Students who exceed the time limitations may have their USF Tampa Graduate Catalog 2013 2014 Section 8 University Degree Requirements 58 registration placed on hold until a request for extension has been approved. Only one time limit extension request is permitted. Students who are temporarily unable to continue the program should submit a Leave of Absence Request, which extends the time limit for the duration of the approved Leave (see Leave of Absence in the Enrollment Requirements section for information; the Leav e of Abse nce Request Form is available online at: http://www.grad.usf.edu/student forms.php ). Enrollment Requirements See Academic Policies Section Institutional Enrollment Requirement The majority of credits toward a graduate degree must be earned through instruction offered by the home institution (e.g., USF Tampa, USF St. Petersburg, USF Sarasota Manatee) granting the degree. For information about the minimum number of credit hours required for the degree refer to the degree requirements in the program listing. Stude nts are responsible for consulting with their degree program coordinator for information on courses that may be taken outside their graduate degree program, as well as the Transfer of Credit Policy for course transfer eligibility requirements. Although equivalent courses may be offered at other institutions (including within the USF System), they may not satisfy degree requirements. Major Professor The Major Professor serves as the student's advisor and mentor. Students should confer with the department to confirm the internal process and timeline for the selection and appointment of the Major Professor. The student must identify a major professor and receive that person' s agreement to serve as major professor. The selection of the Majo r Professor must be approved an d appointed by the department as soon as possible, but no later than the time the student has completed 50% of the program. Students must have a major professor in order to maintain Satisfactory Academic Progr ess. If a Major Professor cannot be identified or in the event a Major Professor is unable or unw illing to continue serving on the student's committee, the student is responsible for finding another Major Professor. Students who are unable to find a replacement Major Professor should confer with the Program Director for available options. If no other options exist the student may be requested to voluntarily withdraw from the program or may be hon orably withdrawn in good academic standing. The student and Major Professor should plan a program of study which, when completed, will satisfy the degree requirements specified. A copy of this program, signed by the student and professor, should be maintained in the student's d epartment file. Major Professors must meet the following requirements: Be active in scholarly pursuits as evidenced by at least one refereed publication in the last three years. Be graduate faculty, as defined by the University. Faculty who do not mee t this definition may serve as CoMajor Professor with faculty who do Be engaged in current and sustained scholarly, creative, or research activities and have met departmental (or equivalent) requirements Have been approved by the Department Chair (or equivalent) to serve as a Major Professor or Co Major Profess or The membership of graduate faculty will be based upon criteria dev eloped within the appropriate program or department and approved at the college level. These criteria must be forwarded to the Dean of the Office of Graduate Studies. USF Tampa Graduate Catalog 2013 2014 Section 8 University Degree Requirements 59 In the event a Major Professor leaves the University (i.e. for an appointment at another university, due to retirement, etc.) and the Major Professor is willing to continue serving on the student's committee, the Major Professor then becomes a CoMajor Professor on the committee and another faculty is appointed as the other Co Major Professor. It is important tha t one of the CoMajor Professors be accessible on the university campus for the student to make satisfactory progress on the thesis/dissertation. In the event a Major Professor is on temporary leave (e.g. sabbatical, research, etc.); the Major Professor shall coordinate with the Program Director to facilitate the needs of the student. In some instances a stude nt may choose to have two professors serve as Major Professor. In this situation the faculty are approved as \"CoMajor Professors\" and jointly serve in that role. Consequently both faculty must sign approval on paperwork pertainin g to the student's processing (i.e. committee form, chang e of committee form, admission to candidacy, etc.). Appointment of a (Co)Major Professor(s) may be rescinded by the Department Chair (or equivalent), with the approval of the appropriate Department (or equivalent) faculty committee (separate from student advisory committee.) (Co) Major Professor(s) of the Graduate Student Supervisory Commit tee Responsibilities Available on the Office of Graduate Studies Website: http://www.grad.usf.edu/policies.php Doctoral Committees Some Colleges have a Program Committee comprised of graduate faculty, who advise the student from admission up to doctoral candidacy, when the formal Doctoral Dissertation Committee is formed. As soon as an area of research is determined and a major professor is selected, a Doctoral Dissertation Committee will be appointed and approved for the student. The Department will request approval of the Doctoral Commi ttee from the Dean of the College and, as needed, the Dean of the Office of Graduate Studies. Role of Doctoral Committees Depending on the College, either the Program Committee or the Doctoral Dissertation Committee is responsible for approvin g the student's course of study grading the written comprehensive qualifying examinatio n Doctoral Dissertation Committee Doctoral Dissertation Committees will, approve the plan for research supervise the research, , read and approve the dissertation, and conduct the dissertation defense. Composition The Doctoral Dissertation Committee will consist of at least four members three must come from the academic area (i.e., discipline) of the student at least one external member (from outside the Department, School, or equivalent, hosting the doctoral program, but may be within the academic discipline) Faculty holding joint or adjunct appointme nts in the degreegranting academic unit (i.e. Department or equivalent ) c annot be external members on a student's committee. USF Tampa Graduate Catalog 2013 2014 Section 8 University Degree Requirements 60 Member Definition All graduate faculty, as defined by the University and the College/Department, and approved by their department and college, are assumed by the Office of Graduate Studies as qualified to be a member of and/or supervise a doctoral committee. Persons desiring to serve on a committee who are not defined as Graduate Faculty (i.e. visiting faculty, professionals, etc.) by the University and the College/Departm ent must submit a curricul um vitae and be approved by the Department, College, and Office of Graduate Studies, for each committee. Committee members must meet the following requirements: Be graduate or affiliate graduate faculty, as defined by the University Have the background and expertise that co ntributes to the success of the student. In addition to the requirements specified in the Graduate Faculty definition, committee membership will be based upon criteria developed within the appropriate program or department and approved at the college level. These criteria must be forwarded to the Dean of the Office of Graduate Studies. Approval Once a commi ttee has been determined, a Doctoral Dissertation Committee Form needs to be completed by the student and submitted to the Committee Members for original signature. Check with the College for instructions and forms. To insure unifor mity of excellence across the colleges, the (Co)Major Professor(s) of Doctoral Dissertation Commi ttees will need to submit a current curriculum vitae (equivalent to an NIH Bio, approximately two pages long with the last three (3) years of scholarly activity included) with the committee appointment form to the College Dean or desig nee. This approval is in addition to the approval from their departm e nt chairperson. (Colleges and departments may institute additional requirements for membership on Doctoral Dissertation Committees.) Once approved, the original form and the approved Curriculum Vitae (CV) are placed in the student's file. An approved and current Form must be on file in the program/college before graduatio n may be certified. Do ctoral Dissertation Committee Forms need to be processed as early in the program as possible, but no later than the semester prior to graduation. Changes to Committee Changes to a Doctoral Dissertation Committee must be submitted on a Change of Committee Form . Check with the College for instructions and forms. Original signatures of facult y being added to the Committee, along with th e approval signature of the (Co) Major Professor(s), must be on the form. Faxed signatures are acceptable. Faculty who are removed from the Committee are not required to sign the form, provided that the (Co) Major Professor(s) has signed. In such instances th e signature of the (Co) Major Professor(s) indicate(s) approval of the change, as well as acknowledgement and approval of the change by the removed member. Any nonfaculty being added to a committee must submit a CV for approva l. If a faculty member is being added as a Co Major Professor, or if there is an appointment change to the Major Professor position, a CV must be included for the faculty member who is being added to that position. Change of Committee Forms should be submitted for approval as soon as the change takes place. Changes to a Committee are official only once approved and filed by the program and college. An approved and current Doctoral Dissertation Committee Form must be on file before graduation may be certified. USF Tampa Graduate Catalog 2013 2014 Section 8 University Degree Requirements 61 Doctoral Qualifying Examination As soon as the substantial majority of the course work is completed, the student must pass a written qualifying examination covering the subject matter in the major and related fields. This examination may be supplemented by an oral examination. Students must be enrolled for a minimum of two (2) hours of graduate credit in their discipline at the time they ta ke the qualifying examination. If the exam is taken between semesters, students must be enrolled for a minimum of two (2) hours of graduate credit in the semester before or following the exam. Admission to Candidacy In order to be admitted to doctoral candidacy, students must meet the following requirements at USF: 1. admission to a doctoral program 2. appointment of a Doctoral Committee , 3. attainment of an overall and degree program Grade Point Average (GPA) of 3.00 at USF at the time of candidacy. (All \"I\" and \"M\" grades, including \"IF\" and \"MF\", must be cleare d bef ore candidacy may be finalized.) 4. successful completion of a qualifying examination 5. certification by the Doctoral Committee that the above qualifications have been successfully completed. The Admission to Candidacy form should be submitted for approval during the semester that the qualif ying exams were completed, but no later than the semester following the successful completion of the exam. The form will be approved by th e Dean of the College and forwarded to the Dean of the Office of Graduate Studies for final approval. Doctoral Candidacy is effective as of the day that the Office of Gradua te Studies approves of the request and changes the student's status to 6C. For procedures and processing deadlines refe r to the Office of Graduate Studies website at www.grad.usf.edu . Once candidacy status is approved, students with approved candidacy are eligible to enroll in dissertation hours (7980) in the semester that immediately follows the last business day of the approval window. For example, students approved during the Fall approval window may enroll in the Spring. Students approved during the Spring approval window may enroll in the summer and students approved durin g the Summer approval window may enroll in the Fall. Students may NOT enroll in dissertation hours prior to being admitted to doctoral candidacy . Each degree program has a required number of dissertation hours for completion of the degree. Departments may, with College approval, apply Directed Research hours towar d the total number of dissertation hours required. Directed Research hours shall not exceed 50% of the dissertation hour requirement. No directed research hours will be converted to dissertation hours (i.e. a directed research course dropped and a dissertation course added) prior to or during the approval window. For more information ref er to Enrollment Requirements in the Academic Policies section. Dissertation Dissertation requirements are for the academic degrees of Ph.D. and Ed.D. For the professional degrees of Au.D. and D.P.T., contact the professional school for doctoral project requirements. The Dissertation must conform to the guidelines of the University.

A copy of the annou ncement sh ould be sent to the Office of Graduate Studies, preferably two weeks in advance of the defense date. The announcement must also be posted in a public forum for a minimum of twentyfour hours to comply with statute requirements for a public meeting. A student must successfully defend the dissertation in order to be able to proceed and complete the final submission process. Doctoral Dissertation Defense Chair The Doctoral Dissertation Defense (Final Oral Examination) shall be presided over by an external committee member from outside the Department, School, or equivalent, hosting the doctoral program, but may be within the academic discipline, OR, a noncommittee member (a.k.a. Outside Chair) (Refer to the individual Prog ram's Degree Requi r ements in the Graduate Catalog for information). If the Chair is from another institution, this individual must be approved for Affiliate Graduate Faculty status. The Doctoral Dissertation Defense Chair's role includes overseeing the proceedings as well as serving as the student's advocate, by ensuring fairness of the process. Faculty holding joint, courtesy , or adjunct appointments in the degree granting academic unit (i.e. Department or equivalent) cannot serve as the Defense Chair. Procedures for Conducting the Doctoral Dissertation Defense (Final Oral Examination) 1. The Doctoral Dissertation defense (final oral examination) should be conducted within a timeline to allow for the student to make any necessary corrections following the defen se and still meet the final copy deadline for turning in the Dissertation to the Office of Graduate Studies. 2. The presentation should be considered an important function in the Department and all graduate students and faculty be encouraged to attend. 3. The presentation and defense are open to the public and as such , must meet the requirements of the Sunshine Laws for the State of Florida. The Doctoral Dissertation Committee deliberation is not public. 4. The room selected for the examination should have adequate seating with an alternate room selected in case of problems. 5. It is required that all members of the Doctoral Dissertation Committee be present for the examination unless an abs ence is approved prior to the defense taking place by the Office of Graduate Studies Dean. In the event that a member cannot attend in person, participation is permissible via speakerphone or video conference. A minimum of three memb ers, including th e Major Professor is required to proceed with the defense. If a noncommittee member (Outside Chair) chairs the Defense, this individual does not count as one of the three required members in attendance. If an unforeseeable situation arises that would prevent compliance with this requirement the Major Professor or Doctoral Dissertation Defense Chair should contact the Office of Graduate Stu dies for guidance and approval to proceed with the defense. USF Tampa Graduate Catalog 2013 2014 Section 8 University Degree Requirements 64 6. The length of the examination period will generally not exceed three hours. Throughout this time the Doctoral Dissertation Defense Chair is to be in charge of all proceedings and, ideally, is expected to play a balancing role between advocacy and contention. 7. The Doctoral Dissertation Defense Chair, at any time during the course of the examination, may request all visitors to leave. 8. Presentation The Doctoral Dissertation Defense Chair should open the proceedings by introducing the candidate and the Doctoral Dissertation Committee. The examination should begin with a presentation by the candidate designed to summarize the dissertation. 9. Questions Following the presentation the Defense may be moved to a different setting for the main examination. The Colle g e determines the order of the proceedings described below: The examination will consist of questions about the research by the Doctoral Dissertation Defense Chair and the Doctoral Dissertation Committee. It is suggested that que stioning should be limited to about 15 minutes for each Doctoral Dissertation Committee member with subsequent rounds of questioning as necessary. Questions from the facultyatlarge and/or the public may be allowed following the presentation. It is suggested that questioning from the general audience be limited up to 5 minutes per person. 10. Delibe rations and Voting Following the completion of these proceedings, the Doctoral Dissertation Defense Chair will ask all visitors and the candidate to leave and will reconvene the Doctoral Dissertation Committee only. will preside over the deliberations and voting of the Committee. (Note: If a non committee member [Outside Cha ir] is used, he/she will not participate in the voting) . is responsible for tallying the votes and informing the candidate of the final decision. The voting is to be limited to \"pass\" and \"fail\" votes. The vote of the Doctoral Dissertation Committee must be unanimous. If unanimous agreement cannot be reached, the Doctoral Dissertation Defense Chair notifies the Department Chair (or appropriate equivalent) who will endeavor to resolve the dispute in an expedient fashion. records the vote on the Successful Defense Form and conveys the decision of the Doctoral Dissertation Committee (Successful Defense form) to the Department/College Graduate office to be kept in the student's file. Dissertation Final Submission Guidelines Information on requirements for submission of the finished and approved manuscript copies is available online at the Thesis and Dissertation website at http://www.grad.usf.edu/ETD resmain.php. Students who fail to submit the final copy of a dissertation by the posted submission deadline will not be considered for graduation. The studen t may be considered for graduation in the following semester and must therefore apply for the degree (graduation) by the posted deadline, enroll in a minimum of two (2) USF Tampa Graduate Catalog 2013 2014 Section 8 University Degree Requirements 65 dissertation hours for that subsequent semester, and meet the submission requirements as posted on the Thesis/Dissertation website. Only after the Office of Graduate Studies has approved the manuscript can the student be certified for the degree. Mandatory Electronic Submission Students are required to submit the dissertation in an electronic format (ETD). Requirement s and procedures are available at the Office of Graduate Studies website at http://www.grad.usf.edu/ETD res main.php Submission for Official Publication and Archiving All theses/dissertations will be submitted to the Office of Graduate Studies designated System for official publication and archiving. Changes after Publication Once a dissertation is approved and accepted by the Office of Graduate Studies for publication, it cannot be changed. Release of Dissertation Publications The University recognizes the benefits from collaboration with sponsors on research projec ts but also recognizes the possibility of conflicts of interest in the di sclosure of the results of the collaborations. While the sponsor's economic interests in the restriction of disclosure should be considered, the University has a primary mission to extend knowledge and disseminate it to the publi c and the broader academic community. The University's \"Statement of Policy Rega rding Inventions and Works\" acknowledges the possible need for delays in publication of sponsored research to protect the sponsor's interests, but it provides no definite guidelines for the restrictions of publication beyond the statement: \"Disclosure delays mutually acceptable to the Inventor, the Vice President for Resear ch, and the sponsor, if any, are authorized in or der to allow patent applications to be filled prior to publication, thereby preserving patent rights...\"8 To protect the University's primary goal from undue compromise, the University has adopted the following guidelines: 1. The recommendations of sponsors, regarding publication of research results should be considered advisory rather than mandatory. 2. In support of academic discourse and the mission to promote and share academic works, Dissertations will be released for worldwide access once submitted to and approved by the USF Office of Graduate Studies. In the event that a patent or copy right application provides reason to delay the release of the Dissertation, a petition to request a one year delay may be submitted to the Office of Graduate Studies for consideration. Such requests must be received by the format check of the dissertation. 3. Stud ents should not be delayed in the final defense of their dissertations by agreements involving publication delays. Duty to Disclose New Inventions and Works Burke, \"University Policies on Conflict of Interest and Delay of Publications,\" Report of the Clearinghouse on University Industry Relations, Association of American Universities, February, 1985. USF Tampa Graduate Catalog 2013 2014 Section 8 University Degree Requirements 66 For information about the requirements of this policy contact the Division of Patents and Licensing at (813) 9740994. Dissertation Change of Grade In the semester in which the final manuscript has been received, reviewed, and certified for permanent filing in the University Library, the Office of Graduate Studies submits the chan ge of grade from \"Z\" to \"S\" for the last registration of dissertation cours es to the office of the registrar when all grades are due at the end of the semester. The Use of \"Ph.D.\" in Credentials and Publication Students may only use the credential of \"Ph.D.\" after degree conferral is granted. It is inappropriat e to use the credential until it is officially and formally granted. The use of the abbreviation \"Ph.D.\" in university publications, correspondence, etc., including websites and other electronic media, shall be upper case \"P\", lower case \"h\" followed by a period, an upper case \"D\" and another period. It shall not be used in the format of all up per case letters without periods, as in \"PHD\". USF Tampa Graduate Catalog 2013 2014 Section 9 Graduation Information 67 Section 9 Graduation Information and PostDoctoral Affairs Application for Degree (Graduation) To graduate, a student must submit the Application for Degree through their College. This application must be submitted in the term of expected graduation by the deadline noted in the academic calendar. If a student applies for graduation and is not approved, a new Application for Degree must be submitted by the deadli ne in a new term. In order for the degree statement to appear on a student's acad emic record, the student must file the aforementioned application whether or not participation in the commencement ceremony is desired. The application for a graduate degree is online at http://www.registrar.usf.edu/form s/GraduateGraduationApp824112011 0824_16_24_22.pdf The application must be submitted to the College advising office prior to the graduation application deadline.

It is the student's responsibility to clear all \"I\" (Incomplete) and \"M\" (Missing) grades in all courses and to provide official transcripts of all transferred course work needed for graduation at least three weeks prior to the end of the term in which he/she expects to graduate. Graduation Requirements It is the student's responsibility to make sure that he/she has met all degree requirements (e.g. be in good standing) as specified in the Policies and Degree Requirements sections of this publication, as well as any College and Program requirements for the degree. Commencement Graduate students may not participate in commencement exercises until all requirements for the degree sought have been fulfilled. Students graduating from programs based from the Tampa campus (despite location, i.e. may be located in St. Petersburg, Sarasota, Lakeland, etc., such as students in Marine Science) participate in commencement exercises on the Tampa campus. All doctoral graduates receive degree conferral from the Tampa campus and therefore parti cipate in commencement exercises in Tampa. Diplomas Diplomas are mailed to the student's permanent address approximately six (6) weeks after commencement. Students with a change of address need to fill out a change of address form at the Registrar's office. Questions regarding diplomas and degree certification should be directed to the Registrar's office at 9742000. USF Tampa Graduate Catalog 2013 2014 Section 9 Graduation Information 68 Letters of Certification Students in need of verification of the degree prior to receiving their diploma may request a Letter of Certification.

For more information, please see www.grad.usf.edu/postdoc USF Tampa Graduate Catalog 2013 2014 Section 10 Degrees, Programs, and Concentrations 70 Section 10 Degrees, Programs, and Concentrations New graduate degrees, programs and concentrations are continually under development and may now be approved and available. Check the website for recently approved programs and for information on which programs are currently accepting applications and which are currently closed for admission. For the most current list of authorized degrees, programs and concentrations, Accelerated Degree Programs, and Dual Degree Programs, go to http://www.grad.usf .edu/programs.php . As of the da te of this publication, the University is authorized to offer 49 different degrees with graduate programs (majors) offered as follows: 127 Master's programs (including the MPAS) 229 Concentrations at the Master's level 2 Education Specialist programs 15 Concentrations at the Specialist leve 45 Doctoral programs (including Ph.D., Ed.D., Au.D., DNP, DrPH) 105 Concentrations at the Doctoral level 3 Professional doctoral programs (including M.D., D.P.T., PharmD) How to understand Degrees, versus Programs, versus Concentrations. The University offers a number of degrees (e.g. M.A., M.S.E.S., Ph.D., etc.) under which various programs (a.k.a. majors) are offered - for example Accounting . Concentrations are formalized areas of study available within the program and may be noted on the transcript and diplom a- for example Tax/Audit . Definitions are noted on the following pag e. Some programs are offered as the area of study presented. Other programs are offered through a variety of concentrations within the Program. The Degree is awarded in the Program, e.g. M.S. in Nursing. For example: Adult Education (Curriculum and Instruction) M.Ed. Education Would translate to: M.Ed. in Curriculum and Instruction with a Concentration in Adult Education M.Ed. = the name of the degree \"Master of Education\" Curriculum and Instruction = the name of the program of study the degree is awarded in Adult Education = the name of the concentration within the program To learn more about the Program or Concentration, refer to the corresponding college section of the Catalog. Note: Programs may also offer plans, tra cks, or areas of study which are informal groupings within a program or concentration. Questions about degrees and concentrations may be directed to the Office of Graduate Studies. USF Tampa Graduate Catalog 2013 2014 Section 10 Degrees, Programs, and Concentrations 71 Definitions Degrees (http://files.acad.usf.edu/edout/New Degree/USF Procedures onNewAcademic Program.pdf ) A degree program is defined as an organized curriculum leading to a college degree in an area of study recognized as an academic discipline by the higher education community, as demonstrated by assignment of a Classification of Instructional Programs (CIP) code by the National Center for Educational Statistics, or as demonstrated by similar programs existing at other colleges and universities, and having designated faculty and instructional resources. Each de gree program will be assigned a CIP code and included in the State University System Academic Degree Program Inventory. Example: Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) Graduate Program (Major) (ref: BOG Regulation 6C8.011 ) An organized curriculum offered as a major area of study that is part of an existing or proposed degree program and does not constitute sufficient distinct coursework, faculty, and instructional resources to be considered a separate degree program. A Program Major must be reasonably associated with the degree program under which it is offered and share comm on core or prerequisite courses with other majors within the same degree program. A Program Majo r will not be assigned a CIP Code, will not be included in the State University System Academic Degree Program Inventory, and will not be recognized as a standalone degree program at the University. The number of credit hours for a Program Major will be establi s hed by the University for each degree level. Example: Curriculum and Instruction Concentration (approved by Graduate Council 3/15/10) A Concentration is a coordinated set of courses in conjunction with examinations, thesis and/or dissertation, sub curriculum that is applicable to one or more existing graduate pro grams. The total number of credit hours must not equal or exceed the number of credit hours established for the Degree Program(s). Concentrations must be approved by the Department (or equivalent), College, and Graduate Council. Concentrations are listed on a student's transcript, but not on the diploma. Also reference BOG Regulation 6C8.011.

Students will be awarded certificates upon completion of specific course work, which has been approved by the Graduate Council. The graduate certificate is not defined as a degree by the Office of Graduate Studies; rather, it is a focused collection of courses that, when complete d, affords the student some record of distinct academic accomplishment in a given discipline or set of related disciplines. Moreover, the graduate certificate is not viewed as a guaranteed means of entry into a graduate degree program. While the courses comprising a gradu ate certificate may be used as evidence in support of a student's application for admission to a de gree program, the certificate itself is not considered to be a prerequisite. Process of Approval for New Graduate Certificates Proposals for new areas of study for graduate certificates are created and submitted by the academic unit that wishes to offer such a certificate. Proposals must be accompanied by endorsement from the department heads and deans of the colleges/schools in which the contributing course work is offered as well as from the academic unit or units whose students or degree programs could be impacted by the creatio n of the graduate certificate. USF Tampa Graduate Catalog 2013 2014 Section 11 Graduate Certificates 91 The Graduate Council will consider all the proposals for new graduate certificates to assure proposal guidelines have been followed and that repetition and redundancy across areas of study for certificates are not evident. Those meeting the criteria set forth by Graduate Council will then be recommended to the Provost for approval. Criteria for Approval The general principles applied to the assessment of the aca demic quality of proposals for new graduate areas of study for certificate include: 1. The proposed sequence of course work must offer a clear and appropriate educational objective at the postbaccalaureate level. 2. The proposed curriculum will achieve its educational objective in an efficient and well defined manner. 3. A perceived need for such a certificate should exist. This provision might be defined in terms of either external markets (i.e., external demand for the skills associated with such a certificate) or internal academic means (i.e., the need for a critical mass of students in a given discipline). 4. An appropriat e number of credit hours must comprise the area of study for the certificate. The number of graduate credits cannot be less than nine (9) or more than onehalf of the credits necessary for a related master's degree from the Office of Graduate Studies. 5. If the area of study for a certificate requires new courses, those courses must be approved by the appropriate College bodies or offices and the Graduate Council. Student Eligibility and Admission Criteria Student must apply and be accepted into the graduate certificate area of study to be eligibl e to receive a certificate. The prerequisites and general criteria of eligibility for admi ssion to an y graduate certificate area of study include: 1. An earned baccalaureate degree or its equivalent from a regionally accredited college or university or enrollment in a USF fiveyear academic program is required. Students in fiveyear acade mic programs may be admitted upon completion of 120 semester hours. 2. Each graduate area of study sets the requirements for admission, including minimum grade point average, standardized test scores, and other similar criteria as part of the application. However, prospective nondegree seeking graduate certificate students must meet University gr aduate admissions grade point average requirements. Students who wish to pursue a graduate certificate must apply to the Graduate Certificate Office (www.gradcerts.usf.edu ) and be admitted to the certificate area. Students are encouraged to contact the coordinator prior to applying. NonDegree Seeking Students All nondegree seeking students who wish to pursue approved graduate certificates should apply for admission to the certificate through the Graduate Certificate Office (www.gradcerts.usf.edu ) as soon as possible for maximum benefit, but must apply to the certificate and complete required coursework within five years of taking the first course applicable to the certificate. Students must submit a Completion Form for the certificate to be awarded. USF Tampa Graduate Catalog 2013 2014 Section 11 Graduate Certificates 92 Degree Seeking Students o All degree seeking students who wish to pursue approved graduate certificates must apply for admission to the certificate through the Graduate Certificate Office (www.gradcerts.usf.edu ). The application must be received prior to conferral of the degree that includes the same coursework. Students who have completed all coursework must apply for admission to the certificate and submit a Completion Form prior to the deadline to apply for graduation by the fourth week of the semester in which the student plans to graduate. o Degree seeking students who are pu rsuing a Graduate Certificate in a discipline outside of their graduate degree program (major) must apply for admission to the certificate through the Graduate Certificate Office (www.gradcerts.usf.edu ). The application must be received prior to the deadline to apply for graduation (by the fourth week of the semester) in which the student plans to graduate. Required coursework for the certificate must be completed within five years of taking the first course applicable to the certificate. Students must submit a Completion Form for the certificate to be awar ded. 3. Certificate seekingstudents not currently enrolled in a degreegrantin g graduate program, will be admitted into a separate classification within the University, and will be classified as \"Graduate Certificate Students.\" This separate classification will permit the University to monitor statistical and enrollment data for certificate areas of study, and will allow inclusion of such efforts in the annual reports and academic plannin g . The Graduate Certificate Office will note successful completion of a certificate on the student's transcript upon completion. 4. Students pursuing a graduate certificate will be required to meet the same academic requirements as those defined for degreeseeking students to remain in \"good standing\". 5. All graduate certificate students may apply one graduate cour se to two graduate certificates. 6. All graduate certificate students must meet all prerequisites for courses in which they wish to enroll. Should a graduate certificate student subsequently apply and be accepted to a degreegranting program, up to twelve (12) hours of USF credit earn ed as a graduate certificate student may be applied to satisfy graduate degree requirements. Any application of such credit must be approved by the degreegranting college and must be appropriate to the program. See the Transfer of Credit Policy for more informatio n. 7. For information on transfer of credit policies pertaining to Graduate Certificates, refer to the transfer of credit policy in Section 7, Academic Policies, of this catalog, Certificate Requirements To receive a graduate certificate: 1. Students must successfully complete certificate requirements as established by the university. Graduate Certificate students will be held to the academic standards for all gra duate students as specified in the Graduate Catalog, unless otherwise noted in the section in the Graduate Catalog regarding Graduate Certificates. 2. Students must submit a completion form. Degreeseeking students must submit this form before graduating from their degree program. Nondegreeseeking students must submit this form no later tha n one semester after completing their certificate course work. 3. Students must have been awarded a bachelor's or higher Catalog 2013 2014 Section 12 College of Arts and Sciences 94 http://www.cas.usf.edu/ Changes to Note The changes for the College of Arts and Sciences were approved by the USFTampa Graduate Council on the dates noted.

Contact college for other accreditation information. College Structure: The College of Arts and Sciences is USF's largest college. The College is comprised of three schools includin g the School of Social Sciences, the School of Natural Sciences & Mathematics, and the School of Humanities, all with strong interdisciplinary connections among them and throughout the University. Mission Statement : The College of Arts and Sciences is a community of scholars dedicate d to the idea that educated people are the basis of a just and fre e society. The essences of education are a capacity for the appreciation of social change within a context of prior human achievement. The faculty of the Arts and Sciences strive to instill in their students a history of human ideas, a love of learning, and an understanding of the means that scholars have used in their search for beau ty and order in the natural world. The education provided by the disciplines of the Arts and Sciences is the foundation upon which the lives and professions of our stude nts are built, and the basis from which personal growth occurs. The College of Arts and Scie nces takes as its goal a melding of the natural, humanistic and social philosophies into a comprehensive whole that encourages the development of new ideas and new approaches to the understanding of our universe. It is the responsibility of scholars to share their discoveries for the better ment of society. Thus, the Arts and Scien c es embrace the disciplines that strive to make immediate use of knowledge in the service of social goals as well as the disciplines whose discoveries contribute to the fund of basic information that is the stepping stone of applied knowledge.

Faculty at USF specialize in various areas, including medical anthropology, biological anthropology, urban policy and community development, education, archaeology, cultural resource management (CRM), economic development, immigration, media, and issues pertaining to race, gender, and ethnicity. Geographic specializations emphasize the Caribbean, Latin America, SubSaharan Africa, Eur ope, and the United States. More than 200 graduates have received an education in anthropology and its practical uses, leading to employment in government and private sector agencies and organizations. For many, the MA is a terminal degree that qualifies them for professional careers in administration, program eval uation, planning, research, and cultural resource management. Others have gone on to earn doctoral degrees and have gained employment in academic or higher level nonacademic positions. Students entering the Master's program in Applied Anthropology at USF choose from one of four tracks: Archaeology, Biological Anthropology, Cultural Anthropology, or Medical Anthropology. Although these four tracks share som e common requirements, and are bound by general rules of the USF Graduate School, they have different curricula and employment trajectories. Archaeology Track graduates typically enter careers in contract archaeology, or public and private agencies and museums responsible for managing archaeological resources. The Cultural Anthropology Track is designe d to lead to employment in diverse areas that include education, urban planning, human services, private sector consulting and research, and nongovernmental community organizations. Museum and heritage programming represent an area of overlap between the two emphases. Students who wish to pursue these kinds of specialtie s will develop curricula that draw from both applied and public archaeology requirements in consultation with their advisors. Biological Anthropology students are trained to work in law enforcement, private sector consulting and research, and nongovernmental organizations. The Medical Anthropology track prepares students to conduct research, evaluation, and cons ulting in a variety of settings, including community based organizations, county and state health departments, and nongovernmental organizations. In addition to following the curriculum of a track, M.A. students can select elective courses to fulfill one of four concentrations in Archaeological and Forensic Sciences, Biocultural Medical Anthropology, Cultural Reso urce Management, or Heritage Studies.

Each Department has its own Chair and Graduate Director and offers students a Master of Science in Biology with a specific concentration associated with either CMMB or IB. There is no general Biology MS degree program. The CMMB and IB Departments are located in modern, well equipped building s. Research in the CMMB Department is done by faculty housed in Interdisciplinary Science Building and the BioScience Faculty building (BSF), and most of the research within the IB Department is conducted by faculty housed in the Science Center building (SCA). Because of the interdisciplinary aspect of most research projects, faculty and graduate st udents often work together on broad training research projects that bring together many of the traditionally separate areas of biology. Many of the faculty within CMMB and IB are involved in cooperative research with their colleague s in Chemistry, Public Health, Nursing, Medicine, Geology, Psychology, Geography, Marine Science, and Environmental Science. Often CMMB and IB graduate students have faculty members from these other areas of USF as members of their graduate committees. Because of the many undergraduate courses that require handson experimental laboratories, both CMMB and IB support many graduate students as Teaching Assistants. CMMB and IB values high quality teaching at all levels of instruction. Research Assistant positions also are available to support research with specific faculty members depending on an individual faculty members funding. Numerous scholarship opportunities are also offered on a competitive basis through the USF Graduate School. Application to the Biology Program is through one of the two departments, with students selecting a formal Con centration. Refer to the Concentration listing in the Catalog for specific information and requirements.

This will prepare students to enter the emerging new technological workforce required to implement biomedical advances that will have a key impact on global health and yield significant societal advantages. The Program is a joint endeavor between the Moffitt Cancer Center and the University of South Florida. Tremendous advances in the detection and treatment of cance r has occurred through basic research and translational medicine, yet cancer continues to adversely affect millions of people worldwide in terms of quality of life, life span, and economic burden. The Moffitt Cancer Center located at the University of South Florida is a leading institution of basic research, clinical research, and patient treatment with a focus e d mission \"to contribute to the prevention and cure of cancer.\" The Moffitt Cancer Center is officially designated as a Comprehensive Cancer Center by the National Cancer Institute of the National Institutes of Health. The Cancer Biology Ph.D. Program's goal is to train the next generation of cancer researchers. Studies of cance r require specific knowledge in multiple fields that have traditionally been independent. Our Cancer Biology Ph.D. program emulates the Moffitt Cancer Center and eliminates these boundaries. Students receive cancer or iented training in multiple areas include: molecular biology, immunology, functional genomics, bioinformatics, drug discovery & development, cancer genetics, cancer prevention & control, cancer therapeutics, cell biology, biochemistry, and proteomics.

Domestic students follow rolling admission. DEGREE PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS Students with only a Bachelor's degree must take 4 ACS entrance exam (with an option to take Biochemistry or Analytical and a requirement to take core exams in Organic, Inorganic, and Physical Chemistry). They must obtain at least the national median ACS score in the required core exams to pass. If they fail, they have the option to retake the exam or remediate the deficiency by obtaining at least B (not a B) in one of our upperdivision u ndergraduate courses (or by taking the exams in the appropriate course and obtaining the equivalent grade) in the area of the deficiency before their candidacy exam. Students with a Master's degree may be required to adhere to the policy at the discretion of the Graduate Council at the ti me of acceptance. Entering students will have a Promotion to Candidacy Committee established upon entering the Ph.D. Program. The Committee advises students as to what courses they need to take in their first semester. There are no set course requirements, but the decision of the Committee is binding. Students will normally be expec t ed to take the first semester of the first year covering \"Tools of Research,\" including literature search and analysis, proposal writing, oral presentation skills, and laboratory instrumental techniques. The second semest er of the course may be required by a student's promotion to Candidacy committee. Advanced courses in other subject areas may be assigned by the Committee, where appropriate. Final coursework decisions are made by the candidate's research advisor. Advisor Selection Students need to choose a prePh.D. candidate research adviser by the beginnin g of the second semester to begin precandidate research in that laboratory (See below). The student will then proceed to initiate a research project by the beginning of the second semester and through the first summer of study. Selection of a research advisor is one of the most important decisions a student will make during the graduate career. In order to avoid hasty or poorly founded decisions each student must discuss potential research projects with at least three members of the chemistry faculty. Appropriate forms can be obtained from the Chemistry Graduate Office and should be completed and returned no later than the end of the second semester (excluding summer semester) after entering the program. Promotion to Candidacy At the conclusion of the first year (before the start of the third semester), a written research document outlining progress to date and future plans is submitted to and approved by the Promotion to candidacy Committee. This proposal is subsequently defe nded in front of the committee. A successful defense results in Promotion to Ph.D. Candidacy, contingent upon the student being formally accepted into a research group. The committee must vote three quarters in favor of the candidate (for a four person committee) or two thirds in favor (for a three person committee) for a pass. A vote of two or four mem bers (or one of three) in favor results in a conditional pass, and the committee must set conditions to be met to promote the student within 30 days of the first meeting. At the discretion of the committe e, the student not promoted to candidacy may be given a pass at a JM.A. level of competency and proceed to obtain a terminal research master's degree or be terminated from the program. Appropriate forms to document promotion to candidacy must be completed and forwarded to the Graduate School. The forms may be obtained from the Chemistry Graduate Office. USF Tampa Graduate Catalog 2013 2014 Chemistry (Ph.D.) 138 http://www.cas.usf.edu/ Dissertation Committee Upon promotion the candidate must formally choose and declare a research adviser and a dissertation committee must be established initially with at least three members. An additional committee member from outside the department or university must be added before the final defense. The research advisor chairs the committee. Original Research Proposal An original research proposal must be writ ten and defended by the end of the first semester of the third year. At the discretion of the research adviser, the student's original research proposal may or may not be related to the student's current or future research. The student must be informed of the research adviser's preference in advance of seeking approval for th e thesis topic. The dissertation committee formally approves the proposal and its defense. The candidate should meet with the dissertation committee members (individually or as a group) to discuss the proposal topic. The original research proposal should follow the format of a major federal granting agency appropriate to the nature of the proposed research. The format of the proposal, in conjunction wit h the topic, should be approved in advance by the dissertation committee. The written proposal must be given to the dissertation committee members two weeks in advance of the scheduled defense. After the defense, the committee must vote three quarters in favo r of the candidate (for a four person committee) or two thirds in favor (for a three person committee) for a pass. A vote of two of four members (or one of three) in favor results in a conditional pass, and the committee must set conditions to be met to pass the candidate within 30 days of the first meeti ng. Stud ents not passing will normally be terminated from the Ph.D. program. Research Data Presentation and Dissertation By the end of the fourth year, a research data presentation must be made to dissertation committee and the committee formally advises the candidate on research milestones that need to be met before permission to \"write up\" the dissertation is granted. The permission to \"write up\" the dissertation can be gi ven at any subsequent time. A peer reviewed publication based upon the dissertation research is required to obtain the degree of Ph.D. Note: Extenuating circumstance s w ill be reviewed on a casesbycase basis. Further, students have to wait a minimum of 6 months after successful completion of the Research Data Presentation (aka Data Defense) (and the associated online data base forms) before they will be permitted to defend their dissertation. This rule can only be waived by the Department Chair with the written approval of the majority of the Thesis Committee in the case of exceptional circumstance s. Final Dissertation Defense Each student should consult with their supervisory committee for deadlines in submitting the dissertation prior to the defense. Thesis or dissertation defense are not normally scheduled during final exam week or during the weeks between regularly scheduled sessions. The dissertation defense must be scheduled through the Chemistry Graduate Office at least two weeks in advance. The Chemistry Graduate Office will then announce the defense to the entire Chemistry Department. The candidate normally defends their dissertation in the fourth or fifth year. NOTE: these deadlines ar e in addition to those imposed by the Graduate School. The Graduate School sets deadlines pertaining to thesis/dissertations each semester. Candidates may be offered a departmental TA position in year five given satisfactory progress in resear ch as judged by the dissertation committee and approval of the Department Chair, TA's are not normally awarded beyond year 5. RA's are only permitted beyond year six in exceptional cases with the written approval of the department chair. It is important to note that the Graduate School will not award tuition waivers for credit hours beyo nd 120 for students entering with a baccalaureate degree and 90 for students entering with a master's degree. Supervisory Committees The M.S. and M.A. supervisory committee should consist of at least three members including the major professor, and two other chemistry faculty members, at least one of whom is outside the student's major area (analytical, biochemistry, etc.)Acc ording to University Regulations, the Ph.D. supervisory committee must consist of at least four (4) members, including the student's research director. At least two (2) of the members must be from an area related to the student's research.

Electives 6 credits Students taking ENC 6745 Teachi ng Practicum must use this as an elective if they count it toward the 33 credits in the degree. No CRW courses will be allowed in the literature track. Only one practicum will be allowed to satisfy degree requirements (including ENC 6745) in Option I. One Directed Study may be used to substitute for degree requirement with the approval of the Graduate Director. Portfolio and Defense 3 credits Three directed study hours to prepare portfolio. In their fourth and final semester (excluding summer terms), MA students will submit a portfolio for review to a threemember faculty committee six weeks prior to the Graduate School deadline for thesis/dissertation submission. Upon submission, the student and chair of the committee will establish a defense date with the Graduate Program Specialist. The portfolio will contain the following: An introductory firstperson essay in which the student offers a selfevaluation of the contents of the portfolio and how it reflects his or her own process of revision, intelle ctual growth, plans for publication/dissemination, and professional development (minimum five pages, not to exceed fifteen). Three revised seminar papers 1520 pages in length, including appropriate MLA or Chicago Style documentation. o Papers should represent three distinct literary periods, including at least one prior to 1800 and one after 1800. In addition, the contents of the portfolio should represent diversity on a national level, with at least one paper focusing on literature of the Americas and the other on literature from Britain (broadly construed) or its colonies . o Papers should be developed under the direction of three different faculty members from the English Department, who then will form the committee for the defense. One member of the committee will serve as the chair, who will coordinate the circulation of the portfolio, the scheduling of the defense, and the submission of eval uation forms to the graduate director within specified deadlines. The portfolio will be reviewed and evaluated by this threemember faculty committee using the published assessment rubric. Members of the portfolio committee will be asked to work with the student to revise the papers she/he wrote for class. The goal is to get the papers into a form that might reasonably be published. Because this option is not a thesis, it does not have to be submitted to the Graduate School, and so it does not need to adhere to the Graduate School deadlines. Defenses should be concluded two weeks before the end of c lasses. The whole portfolio, along with the revised papers and the introductory essay, should be circulated two weeks prior to the defense, to give committee members an opportunity to read it through. Each portfolio paper will be scored on a scale from 1 to 4 overall using the rubric at the en d of the handbook. To pass, a portfolio requires a total score of 9 with no papers earning a 1. USF Tampa Graduate Catalog2013 2014 English (M.A.) 154 http://www.cas.usf.edu/ Each portfolio paper will also be scored on a scale from 1 to 4 on content using the rubric at the end of the handbook. To pass, a portfolio requires a minimum score of 9 in content. Pass with Distinction: portfolios scoring between 11 and 12 will merit distinction; this will be noted in the student's file and can be referenced on a student's CV. Deficiency: portfolios sc oring between 7 and 8 or with one paper earning a 1 will be deficient. Any paper scoring less than 3 will require revision. Individual faculty need to specify in writing what the essay requires for revision in order to pass. Students will have the opportunity to revise during the remaining time of the semester; revised paper(s) need to be submitted to all committee members for approval no later than the last day of class for the seme ster. No second defense is required. Students who fail to revise appropriately before the end of the semester will be put on academic probation and will be required to finalize their papers the following semester (excluding summer unless faculty agree to serv e during the summer). Failure: portfolios that score a 6 or less or portfolios that score less than 9 in overall content fail. Students who fail will automatically be put on academic probation and given the opportunity to revise papers so that the portfolio reaches a minimum score of 9 the following semester (excluding summer unless faculty agree to serve during the summer). A failed portfolio requires a second defense after revision, and the committee will determine if it passes or fails (no deficiencies or distinctions may be awarded). If the portfolio fails after the second defense the student will be academically dismissed from the program. Graduate Assistants on probation in the initial term maintain eligibility for an assistantship. If probationary status is not removed, the student can be removed from assistantship and academically dismissed from the program. The committee will also evaluate the introductory essay using th e appropriate rubric; this grade will be recorded for purposes of program assessment. Oral Defense The committee chair convenes a meeting with the committee and student for 30 minutes; this oral examination provides the opportunity for faculty to question the student on various aspects of the portfolio, and it gives the student the opportu n ity to expand upon and refine ideas represented in writing. The defense also provides an opportunity for further suggestions on publication and revision. After 30 minutes, the committee will convene without the student to discuss a final assessment for the portfolio using the p ublished rubric.

Human Geography studies the construction of space, place, and power. It encompasses the study of economic geographies (e.g. globalization and development), political geographies (e.g. geopolitical struggles and new social movements), and social and cultural geographies (e.g. identities and exclusions). Human geograp h y is key to providing insights into contemporary spatial arrangements, including the role of cities within the global economy, locating urbanrural intersections in the production of uneven development, and how class, gender, and race shape struggles for social justice. Environmental Geography links the study of nature and society and considers the ways in which conve ntional divisions between human and nonhuman (natural) worlds are bridged through the production of socio natures. This understanding is crucial to explaining and ameliorating contemporary environmental problems, including the privatization of natural resources, inequalities in access to food and water, injustices associated with environmental hazards and unde sirable land uses, and the role of human activities in spurring largescale environmental change GI Science and Spatial Analysis concentrates on the use of advanced geospatial technologies, and the development and use of spatial analysis methodologies, to applied research problems in human and environmental geography. A thorough understanding of such geospatial technologies as Remote Sensing, GIS, and GPS, as well as modern methods of spatial statistical analysis and emerging spatial analytical techniques such as agentbased modeling, is a critical aspect of developing appropriate approaches to the analysis of geographic data.

Most research in the CMMB Department is done by faculty housed in the BioScience Facility building (BSF). Due to the interdisciplinary aspect of most Research projects, faculty and graduate students often work together on broad ranging research projects that bring together many of the traditionally separate areas of biology. Many of the faculty within CMMB are involved in cooperative research with their co lleagues in Chemistry, Integrative Biology, Public Health, Nursing, Medicine, Geology, Psychology, Geography, Marine Science, and Environmental Science. Often CMMB graduate students have faculty members from these other areas of USF as members of their graduate committees. Beca use of the many undergraduate courses that require handson experimental laboratories, CMMB support many graduate students as Teaching Assistants. CMMB values high quality teaching at all levels of support. Research Assistant positions may also be available to support research with specific faculty members depending on an individual faculty members funding. Numerous scholarship opportunities are also offered on a competitive basis through the USF Graduate School. Applying to the Department of Cell Biology, Microbiology and Molecular Biology Students interested in attending graduate school within the CMMB Department should visit the CMMB website that can be accessed from the main USF site and review the curre n t CMMB faculty. It is recommended that potential students consider at least 23 CMMB faculty that they would be interested in working with and communicate this USF Tampa Graduate Catalog 2013 2014 Microbiology (M.S.) 221 http://www.cas.usf.edu/ information in their letter of application. It is also recommended that potential students contact the CMMB Graduate Director as well as the individual faculty members they are interested in working with via email. Such communication will facilitate the assignment of the laboratory rotations that CMMB students will participate in during their first semester of residency and also allow the applicant to determine whether the desire d faculty member has positions available in the laboratory. All students admitted to the Masters concentration in Cell Biology and Molecular Biology must establish a supervisory committee.

A review paper of a topic approved by the supervisory committee is required as well as successful completion of the comprehensive qualifying exam after all course work has been completed. For nonthesis master's students, this exam will occur at the end of the program of study. Accelerated nonthesis BS/MS program in Microbiology This program allows B.S. majors in Microbiology to take graduate courses for the electi ve part of the Microbiology degree and apply them to a nonthesis M.S. degree in Microbiology. Successful students will be able to earn the M.S. degree in two additional semesters beyond the completion of the B.S. degree. This accelerated program shares 12 credits between already existing degrees/conc e ntrations: B.S. in Microbiology M.S in Microbiology (NT) Target students and expected outcomes This program will appeal to the more competitive Microbiology majors who would benefit professionally from having the M.S. when they enter the job market but do not want to commit to the longer time a thesis M.S. or a Ph.D. program takes to complete. Professions that do not require bench laboratory experienc e but desire the broadened knowledge base are targeted. Graduates from this program would be ideally suited for health professions, technology based industry, education and government. We also expect that some students will be interested in doctoral education in the biological or biomedical areas. Description and Requirement s Biology majors who have completed the following courses may apply to this program: PCB 3023 Cell Biology PCB 3063 2013 2014 Microbiology (M.S.) 224 http://www.cas.usf.edu/ Graduate Degree Requirements Students admitted into the M.S. portion of the program must complete all the requirements for the M.S. degree (nonthesis) within three semesters of admission. The requirement is 30 hours of graduate work with at least 16 of these hours completed at the 6000 level; 26 hours must be formally structured courses; and at least 15 hours must be in CMMB courses. Students will be required to take 3 core courses from the list below as part of these 26 hours. Of the required 26 hours, 9 hours will be derived from the coreCMMB graduate courses listed below (see associated curriculum). These requirements can be partially met by up to 12 hours of graduate courses taken as undergraduates. Any graduate class taken outside of CMMB must be approved by the CMMB Graduate Director. Students should be aware that a B grade or better is required for every graduate class applied to the MS portion of their degree. In addition, students will be required to pass an oral qualifying exam based on a review paper submitted in their final semester. Students must form a committee as part of their action plan to complete their graduate work. This committee will be comprised of at least 3 CMMB faculty, and will serve as the examination committee for the review paper required as part of the MS portion of their degree. Upon approv al of that paper, students must successfully complete a comprehensive oral exam by their committee. Timeline and benchmarks: 1. Completion of prerequisite upper division courses and application to the accelerated program. Typically students will be in their junior year. 2. Acceptance into the program and an action plan within a semester of application. 3. Students will take up to 12 credits of graduate credit in CMMB courses following acceptance into the program. Typically these courses will be taken in the latter half of the junior year and in the senior year. Bio Advise will monitor the progress of the students and ensure they follow their action plan. Students who do not complete at least 9 hours of graduate work by graduation will be dropped from the accelerated M.S. program. 4. GRE exams will be taken in a timely manner so scores will be available for admission to the M.S. portion of the program. Students who do not comple te the GR E in time will not be admitted to the accelerated M.S. program. 5. Students must apply for admission to the M.S. portion of the program in a timely manner (Fall admission deadline is February 15, Spring deadline is Au gust 1). 6. Students admitted to the accelerated program must form a committee prior to the beginning of their first semester in the M.S. portion of the program and must continue to follow the action plan which will be monitored by BioAdvise. 7.

MPA Concentration PROGRAM INFORMATION The Public Administration Program offers a multidisciplinary course of study leading to the Master of Public Administration (M.P.A.). The M.P.A. degree is designed primarily to prepare students for successful leadership roles and management careers in the public (i.e., governmental and quasigovernmental organizations) and nonprofit sectors. Students enrolled in the M.P.A. Program pursue careers in local, state, or federal agencies of government, nonprofit organizations, and spec ial service districts. Additionally the M.P.A. degree prepares individuals for further academic study leading to a doctorate in Public Administration, a Ph.D. in Public Policy and Administration, as well as a variety of other disciplines. Those employed in public management positions may wish to pursue the M.P.A. in orde r to broaden educational backgrounds to prepare for increased job responsibilities, or to change career paths. Such in service students currently make up the majority of the M.P.A. student body. The Public Administration Program also offers courses of study leading to a Graduate Certificate in Public Management (G.C.P.M.), Graduate Ce rtificate in Research Administration (G.C.R.A.) and Graduate Certificate in Nonprofit Management (G.C.N.M.). These programs are designed for individuals who wish to acquire knowledge of public and nonprofit management theory and practices, but who do not find it necessary or feasible to pursue the M.P.A. degree. The M.P.A. Program also serves preservice students who have recently completed a bachelor's degree, who wish to gain entry to a professional career track. Students admitted to the M.P.A. are not eligible for the Graduate Certificate in Public Management. Accreditation: Accredited by the Commission on Colleges of the Southern Association of Colleg e and Schools; the National Association of Schools of Public Affairs and Administration (NASPAA). ADMISSION INFORMATION Must meet University requirements (see Graduate Admissions) as well as requirements listed below. Program Admission Requirements USF Tampa Graduate Catalog 2013 2014 Public Administration (M.P.A.) 254 http://www.cas.usf.edu/ Admission decisions to the M.P.A. Program are based on an overall assessment of the applicant's potential for successfully completing the M.P.A. degree. General admission criteria include scores obtained on the Graduate Record Examination (GRE), performance as an undergraduate. Specific criteria are: Completion of a Bachelor's degree from a regionally accredited university. The University of South Florida requires a 3.00 (B) grade point average (calculated using grades earne d for all coursework completed during junior and senior years of undergraduate study), and GRE scores of 60 percentile or above on the verbal portion, 25 percentile or above on the quantitative portion and 4.0 or above on the analytical portion preferred. This provision applies to all applicants, including those who have already comple ted courses in the MPA curriculum. Regardless of GPA, those who score below 20 percentile on either the verbal or quantitative sections on the GRE are required to retake the exam. Two letters of recommendation, one from a faculty member familiar with the applicant's academic performance and potential. Should the applicant be unable to provide the letter from a former professor, with the director's approval, lette rs from other sources will be accepted. The submission of a onepage career statement detailing the applicant's career goals and asp irations, including ways in which the applicant believes the M.P.A. degree can help to facilitate the stated goals. Approval by the M.P.A. Admissions Committee and, if deemed necessary, an admissions interview. Applicants lacking the background necessary for graduate study in the M.P.A. Program may be asked to take additional undergraduate courses prior to admission. The GRE is a required element for MPA admission. However, at the discretion of the MPA program, it may be waived under certain conditions. Examples where GRE requirements may be waived include: o Applicant already possesses a graduate degree from a regionally acc redited university o A written application by the student and a current resume indicating senior level experience o Five years or more of practical, professional experience at a senior level (to be determined upon review of documentation by the admissions committee) o Documentation of past experience through letters of recommend ation from senior managem ent, and o Completion of the GCPM or GCNM certificates with a grade point average of 3.5/4.0 or better and no certificate course grade less than a B. o Approval of the Public Administration Admission Committee; decision to be made on a case by case basis. (Additional documentation and a persona l interview may be required) DEGREE PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS There are two options for the M.P.A. Students are in either the Traditional M.P.A. track or the online Concentration in Executive Public Administration (EPA). Students in the Concentration complete a minimum total of 36 hours; students in the traditional M.P.A. complete a minimum of 45 hours. Program Core Requirements (21 hours) PAD 6060 Public Administration Theory and Practice 3 PAD 6041 Ethics and Public Service 3 PAD 6227 Public Budgeting 3 PAD 6307 Policy Analysis, Implementation, and Program Evaluation 3 PAD 6703 Quantitative Aids for Public Managers 3 USF Tampa Graduate Catalog 2013 2014 Public Administration (M.P.A.) 255 http://www.cas.usf.edu/ PAD 6710 Public Information Management 3 PAD 6275 Political Economy for Public Managers 3 Traditional M.P.A. Requirements Course requirements: 6 hours PAD 5700 Research Methods in Public Administration 3 PAD 6417 Human Resources Management 3 Electives (1215 credit hours) Each student must take 1215 elective credit hours depending on the exit option chosen. Students should refer to the MPA website http://www.cas.usf.edu/pad/index.html http://w ww.spa.usf.edu for cours es approved by the Program. Students must maintain an overall GPA of 3.00 or better in all of their coursework during the program. Internship (6 credit hours) Preservice students are required to complete a supervised internship (PAD 6946. Internship in Public Administration) in a governmental or nonprofit organization. Internships provide students the opportunity to gain valuable experience in the public sector, thereby enhancing the academic course of study. Internship credits must be earned while the student is in residence and before the student has completed regular course work requirements. Exceptions to this rule can only be made by the M.P.A. Director and must be made in advance. Inservice students, who have appropriate managerial/work experienc e commensurate with their career goals, may not be required to complete an internship. After consultation with the student, the M.P.A. Director may choose to waive the internship requirement. Exit Requirements Capstone Course (3 credit hours) PAD6056, The Practice of Public Management, is a final step before graduation. The course is designed to provide student s with the opportunity to apply their kno wledge, leadership, communication, and decisionmaking skills acquired during the MPA Program. This course is designed to challenge students to demonstrate their capability in synthesizing and integrating conceptual frameworks, and relate these skills to managerial or administrative situations. To be eligible for the Capstone course, students mus t be in their last semester or have completed a minimum of 13 courses. A minimum grade of \"B\"must be earned in the Capstone Course. Students who transfer before completing all of the requirements for the MPA at USF will need to enroll into a capstone class at another NASPAA accredit ed institution with prior approval provided by the Director of Public Administration. An Independent Research class cannot be substituted for PAD 6056 The Practice of Public Administration. Concentration in Executive Public Administration (EPA) 12 hours Contact information: http://onlinempa.u sf.e du/ The Concentration in Executive Public Administration is available to students with significant executive level experiences and substantial future leadership potential. This program is only offered on an online basis. Students admitted to the M.P.A. in Public Administration with a Concentration in Executive Public Administration are admitted only on a cohort basis. Admitted students are expected to remain in their cohort throughout their graduate matriculatio n.

This may be, but is not restricted to, a literature review, a report of independent research, the design and (or) analysis of a sample survey or experiment, a report on consulting with research workers outsi de the department, or a report on the construction of a computer program requiring statistical numerical analysis. B. Thesis Option Student's Graduate Committee Students working toward a thesis degree will have the benefit of a committee of members of the graduate faculty, appointed by the program director/departmental chairperson and approved by the Dean of Graduate Studies. The committee will approve the course of study for the student and plan for research, supervise the research and any comprehensive qualifying exams, and read and approve the thesis for conten t and format. USF Tampa Graduate Catalog 2013 2014 Statistics (M.A.) 274 http://www.cas.usf.edu/ At least 30 hours of stat and math graduate courses (see above for details). Taking the sequences Statistics Methods and Mathematical Statistics with at least a \"B\" average for each sequence. At least 6 hours in MAT 6971, Master's Thesis, only 6 hours of which are counted in the 30 hours requirement. Oral Defense of the Thesis Final Submission of Approved Thesis. Under this degree option, six (6) research credits may be applied to the total of 30 required on the student's program of study. These reductions are made to allow the student sufficient time to complete a formal master's thesis. A master's thesis is a scholarly composition that demonstrates the ability of the author to do independent and cre ative work. It explores in some depth a problem or issue related to the major field of study. Although considerable variations in format and style are acceptable, precise expression, logical construction, and meticulous attention to detail are essential. A thesis in statistics should deal with some aspect of statistical methodology or theory, or the development of statistical models for a clas s of problems related to a scientific question. While most theses will include a case study or example that involves scientific data, the analysis of a particular data set does not, alone, constitute the level of scholarly acco mplishme nt required for a thesis.

Graduates of this program will go on to play a vital role addressing the planning and public policy challenges in our region and beyond. The program recognizes the need for effective planners to possess diverse skills in the planning and management of human settlements. Accordingly, the MURP core coursework includes thematically related courses in land use planning, research methods, quantitative analysis, planning theory and history, planning politics and policies, and geographic information systems (GIS). Students have the option of specializing in housing & community developm ent, land use planning, local economic development, GIS, international development and transportation planning. These areas of specialization build on the strengths of existing faculty in our sisterprogram in Public Administration as well as colleagues and facilities across the university. The program is therefore distinct for its flexibility. Graduates of the program will be able to: 1. Engage in policyrelated research relevant to urban and regional issues 2. Assume positions of leadership public, private and nonprofit organizations engaged in planning, land use, and public policy 3. Further public discourse on the problems confronting cities and regions 4. Utilize communi cations and technical skills to become successful at all levels of the planning profession.

ABA provides an approach for developing, implementing, and evaluating practical strategies to produce change s in socially significant behaviors of individuals in the context of community settings. Three important features characterize the scientific basis upon which ABA is built: a) it focuses upon objectively measurable behavior of individuals; b) it studies environmental influences upon the targeted behaviors; and c) it places a premium upon singlesubject research designs to anal yze the effects of different environmental variables. The 44credit hour master's degree in ABA is in the department of Child and Family Studies in the College of Behavioral and Community Sciences. Students demonstrate knowledge of behavioral principles and procedures in courses that constitute a core curriculum, demonstrate applied behavior anal ysis skills through supervised practicum experiences, and complete a data based thesis. The master's degree program is designed to prepare students to meet the standards to be Board Certified Behavior Analysts (BCBAs). It will prepare them for employment in a variety of fields where there are growing demands for competent professionals with expertis e in applied behavior analysis. Philosophy The systematic analysis and application of behavioral principles is an extensive repertoire of professional behaviors. In the USF ABA program, these skills are acquired as students move through the sequenced curriculum of coursework and practicum experiences. The curri culum requires application of behavior analytic principles, with direct supervision by faculty and BCBA supervisors. Students participate in practicum training in community agencies under the supervision of BCBAs. In addition to the 1025 hours of behavior analysis practice they complete in their practicum sites each week, students also participate in practicum seminars each semeste r. In these seminars, the Practicum Coordinator discusses important practice issues and facilitates student discussion of their applied work. The supervision of the students' research theses rests in the hands of designated core faculty members (i.e., \"major professors\"). Major professors serve as mentors for the students by closely supervising their research and their progress through the program. Therefore, as students are mentored by their major professors during the program, a meaningful major professor student relationship is essential.

The primary objective of the program is preparation of the graduate for professional social work practice through acquisition of spec ialized knowledge and skills necessary for clinical practice with individuals, families, and groups. The secondary objectives of the M.S.W. program are: 1. to prepare students academically for pursuit of doctoral education in social work or related human service disciplines or professions; 2. to contribute to the needed supply of professionally educated clinical social work ers in the Tampa Bay area, the state, the region, and the nation. The M.S.W. program offers a specialized course of study in direct clinical practice. The program offers students a core curriculum, plus electives, and a supervised field experience designed to produce professionals with individual, fa mily, and group practice skills. M.S.W. graduates are prepared to engage in advanced clinical social work practice. As such, it is our goal that by completion of the program, students will be prepared: 1. To become advanced social work practitioners who integrate the knowledge, skills , and values of the profession so they are able to conduct evi dence informed practice effectively and ethically with individuals, groups, families, organizations, and communities ranging from local to global levels. 2. To engage in addressing the needs of vulnerable, oppressed, and underserved populations and to promote university community partnerships that strengthen communities and further soci al and economic justice. 3.

To contribute to the body of knowledge regarding theory and skills that is critical to the practice of effective social work and the vitality of the profession. 5. To engage in the pursuit of professional ifelong learning, which may include advanced education preparation necessary to sustain professional competency. The M.S.W. program places great emphasis on standards of professional be havior and ethics in the practice of social work. Entrance into the M.S.W. program does not guarantee graduation from the program. Students admitted to the M.S.W. program must maintain a minimum GPA of 3.0, in all social work courses, with no grade below \"B\" counting toward graduation. Failure to maintain the specified GPA or to exhibit responsible professional behavior determined by the School may result in suspension or dismissal from the program. Courses with grades below \"B\" must be repeated before progressing to the next sequence. Students must pass the comprehensive paper during the last semester in order to graduate from the program. Students may pursu e the M.S.W. program on either a full or part time basis. Both programs consist of 60 semester hours of study.

This includes 21 hours of dissertation. A minimum of 45 hours of coursework must be completed at the University of South Florida. Foundation Courses These courses are designed to develop an appreciation of the institution of business and to help students see how their areas of specialization fit into this general picture. With the approval of the student's program committee, a student may satisfy these require ments in any of the following ways: A. By completing an undergraduate degree in business at an AACSB accredited institution, with an average of \"B\" or better in the last 60 hours, no more than 5 years prior to admission to the Ph.D. program. B. By completing an M.B.A. degree at an AACSB accredit ed institution, no more than 5 years prior to admission to the Ph.D. program C. By completing one approved course with a grade of \"B\" or better in each of the functional areas: Accounting, Finance, Information Systems, Management, and Marketing. All graduate leve l courses at the 6000 level or above, with the exception of specific \"tool\" courses (e.g. statistics), will count toward this requirement. D. By successfully petitioning the doctoral Program Committee to accept previous academic work (e.g., spe cialized Masters programs in business, degrees granted more than 5 years ago, etc.) in fulfillment of all or part of this requirement. Such a petition must be initiated during the first semester of the program. CORE REQUIREMENTS The core courses are designed to provide a strong background in Economics and to develop the student's quantitative and statistical research skills. These courses are required of all students in the program. The College will waive a course only if the student has passed the same or equivalent course with a grade of \"B\" or better within the preceding five years. The Economics requirement can be met by completing two gradu a te level economics courses that have been approved by the student's program committee. Students are required to take a one credit hour research skills course, QMB 7555, Research and Writing Wkills for Doctoral students, in the first semester of the Program. Follo wing this introductory course, the quantitative and statistical coursework is to be determined by the student's program committee in consultation with the student. A three course series is required. An appropriate sequence should be chosen from the following: ECO 6424 Econometrics I 3 ECO 6425 Econometrics II 3 ECO 7426 Econometrics III 3 ECO 7427 Econometrics IV 3 QMB 6375 Applied Linear Statistical Models 3 QMB 7565 Introduction to Research Methods 3 QMB 7566 Applied Multivariate Statistical Methods 3 Any substitution of appropriate mathematics, statistical and quantitative coursework must be approved by the Doctoral Program Committee, preferabl y at the time of acceptance, or definitely before the student takes a substitute course. In addition, students are required to take an additional research elective approved by their advisory committee. Should a student earn a grade of \"C\" or lower in the core courses, the case will be brought before the Doctoral Program Committee for review. After reviewing the case, the Committee will take one of the following steps: a. Require the student to pass an examination that covers the material relevant to the subject. A student who fails the exam on the first attempt may retake it within one year. A student who fails the exam on the seco nd attempt will be subject to dismissal. b. Require the student to retake the course. If the student retakes the course and fails to receive a grade of \"B\" or better, the student is subject to dismissal. USF Tampa Graduate Catalog 2013 2014 Business Administration (Ph.D.) 347www.coba.usf.edu Concentration Field All students will take at least five (5) courses at the 6000 or 7000 level in an area designated as the student's Concentration . Students are encouraged to identify courses in the concentration field that will provide experience in applying current research techniques to problems in that field. To accomplish this, the student may propose a combination of forma l classroom courses and independent directedresearch courses. This combination may include a yearlong research seminar in which the groundwork is laid for the student's dissertation. The specific agenda of courses will be determined by the student's program committee.

Business Intelligence (BI) Track The M.S./MIS program offers a track in business intelligence. The requirements for this track are as follows. Required Courses Students will have to complete four out of the following five courses: ISM 6136 Data Mining* 3 ISM 6218 Advanced Database Management 3 ISM 6208 Data Warehousing 3 ISM 6137Statistical Data Mining* 3 QMB 7566 Applied Multivariate Statistical Methods 3 USF Tampa Graduate Catalog 2013 2014 Management Information Systems (M.S.) 366www.coba.usf.edu In addition, graduate students who take the courses to satisfy this track and earn a GPA of 3.00 or higher for the courses in the track, will receive a \"Joint SAS/USF Certificate in Analytics and Business Intelligence,\" when they use a SAS analytics package as part of some of these courses. *Specifically, graduate students will need to use, among other tools, SAS Enterprise Miner or an equipalent SAS analytics package in the Data Mining and Statistical Data Mining courses. Students may take both of the data mining courses, but only need to complete one of the two courses and four courses in the track to be eligible for the Certificate. The tool wil be provided free for class uses by SAS Institute. Accelerated B.S./M.S. Program The goal of the USF College of Business integrated undergraduate graduate program in MIS is to provide outstanding undergraduate students an option to complete the B.S. undergraduate degree in MIS and the M.S. graduate degree in MIS in five years (141 total hours). The integrated B.S./M.S. program is a 141hour undergraduate graduate option that allows eligible students to work towards the M.S. in MIS degree requirements while completing their undergraduate B.S. degree. Students interested in this option will work closely with an advisor and a faculty member to develop an integrated plan of study. General Guidelines Time of admission to the program: Students will be eligible for admission to the inte grated degree program at the beginning of their Senior year in MIS. Students must apply for admission consideration during their Junior year. Students will start taking courses in the graduate program in their Senior year. Joint admission: Students must apply to and meet admission requir ements of the M.S. in MIS grad uate program. Plan of study: In consultation with an advisor and a faculty member, students will be required to prepare a Graduate Degree Action Plan. The plan will cover the entire time period of the program and it will be periodically reviewed with an advisor. Advising: Students will present their portfolio (see below for de tails and a plan of study in person to the integrated program committee prior to being admitted to the program. Tuition charges: Students will be required to pay graduate tuition rates when taking graduate courses. Admission Requir ements 1. Students with at le ast a Junior standing in their undergraduate degree program may apply for admission consideration into the integrated B.S./M.S. undergraduate/graduate program Students will submit an Accelerated Program Interest Form that must be signed by the Graduate Program. 2. Students must have a minimum 3.25 GPA. 3. Interested students will be required to present a \"portfolio\" of the following credenti als: a. Three letters of recommendation, at least two from faculty b. Statement of intent\u2014a personal statement about why the student wishes to apply for the integrated program. c. Undergraduate transcripts. d. Other supporting documents (e.g., projects and papers, software, work experienc e , internships, etc.) should be included where possible. 4. The GMAT or GRE should be taken sometime before or during the Fall semester of the Junior year of study. 5. All applicants will need to meet any other admission requirements established for the M.S. in MIS program. 6. The application to the integrated program will be considered as a comple te package and therefore obtaining a high undergraduate GPA is not a guarantee of admission. Grades in the undergraduate MIS core courses will be taken in consideration and will have a significant impact on the M.S./MIS acceptance decision. USF Tampa Graduate Catalog 2013 2014 Management Information Systems (M.S.) 367www.coba.usf.edu Degree Requirements 5Year Plan of Study for Integrated B.S./M.S. Undergraduate Graduate Program: With appropriate planning, a total of 12 hours of graduate credit may be taken that can be applied to both the B.S. and M.S. degrees. This will reduce the minimum total credits required for both programs from 153 (120 for B.S., 33 for M.S.) to 141 credits. Spec ifically: 9 hours of graduate credit can be taken in place of the 9 hours of elective undergraduate credits. The student must earn a minimum grade of B in each graduate course that is to be counted for both degrees. The graduate level Operations and Supply Chain P rocesses course ISM 6436 can be taken in place of the comparable undergraduate course ISM 3431. A comprehensive plan of study to complete the integrated B.S./M.S. program will be developed with the guidance of an advisor and a faculty member. A possible plan of study could be as follows. Summer sessions may also be included in the study plan. First and Second Year Courses and credits as designated for Freshman and Sophomore years.

New cohorts will begin twice each year in January and August. USF Tampa Graduate Catalog 2013 2014 Management Information Systems (M.S.) 368www.coba.usf.edu Students will continue to be enrolled in the program as long as they 1) Remain Infosys employees 2) Continue to meet the USF and COB academic standard of maintaining a minimum GPA of 3.00/4.00. Students who fail to enroll in program courses for six or more months will be required to reapply for admission. In that case COB will not guarantee availability of courses in the USFInfosys program. St udents ha ve a break in enrollment must complete all required coursework within five years from the cohort start date as defined in the 2012/2013 and subsequent USF catalogs. Prerequisites Incoming students are expected to have completed or be enrolled concurrently in the following courses or equivalents: A one semester course that addresses a highlevel, objectoriented programming language (e.g. C#, C++, Java) or substantial programming experience A one semester course in systems analysis and design or equivalent experience A one semester course in database systems or e quivalent experience A one semester in statistics A one semester course in economics A one semester course in financial accounting Prerequisite coursework may be completed at any regionally accredited college or university either on site or online; required prerequisites may also be satisfied by completion of nonacademic credit courses that spec ify learning objectives and provide for assessment of learning.

Accreditation: The Master of Arts in ASD and InD meets the accreditation standards required by the College of Education, University of South Florida. The proposed curriculum in the program is aligned with the co nceptual framework of the College of Education and will meet the specific standards of the National Council for the Accreditation of Teacher Education (NCATE) and the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools (SACS). Major Research Areas The program benefit to the university, local community and the state can be summarized in two ways. In a quantitative way, the program meets the need of preparing effective teachers to work with the growing number of students in general and special education who are identified as having ASD labels. This is demonstrated through the critical shortage of data at a nat ional and state level and also in the surveys of local school districts to USF. In a qualitative way, the program meets the need to prepare effective teachers to work with this group of students that represents a paradigmatic shift in where and how these students learn. Students with ASD and InD labe ls need meaningful access to general education curriculum and their typically developing peers and this program meets this need. ADMISSION INFORMATION Must meet University requirements (see Graduate Admissions) as well as requirements listed below. Program Admission Requirements An earned baccalaureate degree in education or a related field that has a relationship with autism and/or intellectual disabilities from a regionally accredited college of university.

Graduation Requirements: Portfolio System The Master's Portfolio System is a means through which each master's level student demonstrates his/her competency in the \"best practices\" of special education. Commensurate with the belief that the merging of research and practice is desirable and beneficial; the Department of Special Education has identified eight areas in which students are required to demonstrate their competency: Professional and personal selfawareness Assessment of exception students Behavior management Classroom instruction Collaboration Knowledge of the professional literature Research in critical areas such as child development, learning and teaching Professional development The department has also developed a list of suggested artifacts through which students can document their competency in each area. Students sh ould meet with their advisor to discuss and plan their individualized portfolio. A copy of the Master's Portfolio System complete with policies and procedures, as well as suggested artifacts, is available with the Program Coordinator. Each student will be required to present his/her individualized portfolio to the Portfolio Review Committee in the Department of Special Education upon comple tion of their program.

Graduate Certificates Offered: See Graduate Certificates COLLEGE REQUIREMENTS General Program Requirements The requirements for graduate degrees from the College of Engineering consist of University requirements, College requirements, and Program requirements. For University requirements refer to the Graduate School Policies and Procedures. College requirements are listed below. Refer to the degree program sections for other requirements. Master's Degree Programs The Master's degree is awarded for advanced study beyon d the baccalaureate degree within an area of specialty. The College of Engineering offers several programs leading to degrees at the master's level. Master of Science in Designated Engineering Field Thi s de gree is normally awarded to a Master's graduate who holds a Bachelor's degree in the designated field. Some programs offer this degree in two options: (1) thesis option (30 credits), and (2) nonthesis option (30 credits). Master of Science in Engineering Science This program is designed to meet the needs of students who wish to pursue an interdiscip linary cou rse of study and research. This degree is individually tailored to student needs. Some programs offer this degree in two options: (1) thesis option (30 credits), and (2) non thesis option (30 credits). Master of Science in Engineering This degree is normally awarded to a Master's gradua te who has a Bachelor's degree from a nonengineering program and has completed a prescribed series of undergraduate engineering courses. Some programs offer this degree in two options: (1) thesis option (30 credits), and (2) nonthesis option (30 credits). Master of Designated Discipline This degree is normally awarded to a Master's graduate who has an undergraduate degree in the discipline and who follows an all coursework program or a project program. USF Tampa Graduate Catalog 2013 2014 Section 16 College of Engineering 532 http://www.eng.usf.edu/ College of Engineering Requirements for Master's Degree 1. A thesis program must contain a minimum of 24 credit hours of coursework and a minimum of 6 credit hours of thesis. (If a student transfers from a thesis program to an all coursework program, no thesis hours may be transferred, converted or counted toward the degree.) 2. Nonthesis program requirements vary according to departmen t bu t must contain a minimum of 30 credits of approved coursework. 3. Students must maintain an overall grade point average of 3.00. No grade below \"C\" will be accepted in a graduate program. If a student's average falls below 3.00, the student will be placed on prob ation. 4. Most programs require students to pass a final oral or written comprehensive examination prior to receiving the degree. These examinations are arranged and administered by the student's department. Accelerated Programs Leading to Accelerated Bachelor's and Master's Degrees Students who are clearly interest e d in graduate study are invited to pursue an accelerated program leading to a Bachelor's Degree and Master's degree in the College of Engineering. . Students in the Accelerated Program may apply up to 12 credit hours of coursework, which must be approved by the Graduate Program Coordinator, to count towards both degrees. Students apply for admission to this progra m through their advisors, who should be consulted regarding additional requirements. Several factors, which vary by academic department, are considered for admission. However, all applicants must have a minimum GPA of at least 3.00. Doctoral Degree Programs The Doctor of Philosophy degree is awarded in recognition of demonstrated scholarly competen c e and ability to conduct and report original and significant research. Unlike the baccalaureate and Master's degrees, the Ph.D. degree cannot be earned by an accumulation of course credits over a period of residence alone. After adequate fundamental preparation to gain compete nce, the student must demonstrate resea rch capability through completion of an authoritative investigation in the chosen engineering field, culminating in a written dissertation. The dissertation must demonstrate that the student possesses the ability to reason logically, the talent for engaging in significant and original research, and the ability to organize and present conclusions in a professional manner. Doctor of Philosophy in Des ignated Engineering Field This degree is awarded to students pursuing a program in one of the following Engineering disciplines: Biomedical Engineering, Chemical Engineering, Civil Engineering, Computer Science and Engineering, Electrical Engineering, Environmental Engineering, Industrial Engineering, and Mechanical Engineering. Students receiving this degree must demonstrate a thorough foundation in the designated disci pline. Doctor of Philosophy in Engineering Science This program is designed to meet the needs of students who wish to pursue doctoral studies in interdisciplinary areas closely related to engineering. College of Engineering Requirements for Doctoral Degrees 1. Supervisory Committee. An advisor will be appoin ted by the chair of the appropriate department or program for each student during the first semester of registration at the University of South Florida. The advisor will help determine the student's area of research interest and will delineate preliminary course assignments. At the earliest possible date, a major professor will be appointed and a supervisory committee formed. This committee will monitor the stude nt's program of studies and has full responsibility for conducting the studen t's qu alifying examination. The Supervisory Committee consists of a minimum of five members. One member of the committee USF Tampa Graduate Catalog 2013 2014 Section 16 College of Engineering 533 http://www.eng.usf.edu/ must be outside the College of Engineering. (The requirement may be waived if special reasons exist and prior approval is obtained from the Engineering Associate Dean for Academic Affairs.) A majority of the committee will be from the College of Engineering, with at least two departments of the College represented. 2. Credit Hours. A minimum of 72 hours beyond the baccalaureate degre e, including a minimum of 20 hours of dissertation, and a minimum of 30 hours of coursework (excluding independent study and directed research) is required by the College. Further requirements may be imposed by the candidate's doctoral program and supervisory committee. See individual programs for specific requirements. 3. Learning Focus. Throughout the student's program of study, independent learning will be emphasized. For the first time in the participant's career, in most cases, the student will be responsible for mastering a new domain of knowledge without the aid of organized lectures and textbooks. The principal information source will be current literature. Such experience is a necessary preparation for a meaningful career in engineering and other fields where the professional must keep pace with a large, eve rchanging body of knowledge. 4. Qualifying Examination. A written and oral qualifying examination, conducted by the supervisory committee, will be taken by each Ph.D. student as soon as a substantial majority of coursework is completed. 5. Admission to Candidacy. Students must be admitted to candidacy before they register for dissertation. Before admission to candidacy, students must have officially formed a Ph.D. Supervisory Committee and passed the qualifying examination of paragraph 4. Once admitted to candidacy students must enroll for a minimum of 2 credit hours each semester of the academic year until completion of program. 6. Dissertation Research. The student must carry out an investigation resulting in an original and significant contribution to the knowledge in the field of research. The requirement of uniqueness means that the dissertation research will provide an important creative experience for the student. As the final stage of the student's program, the candidate must prepare a written dissertation covering the research. Students in the Ph.D. program must take an appro priate number of doctoral dissertation credits, but not less than 20 hou rs; the exact number is determined by department and/or individual requirements. The defense of the dissertation will conform to Graduate School general rules. 7. Residency. Minimum residency requirements may be satisfied by completing the University's minimal requirement at the University of South Florida. Any graduate work counted toward the fulfillment of the requirement for the Ph.D. degree after admission to candidacy must be accomplished within 5 calendar years. Collaboration with Other Colleges and Departments Advanced study and research challenges exist at the interfaces between engineering and other academic disciplines. Examples include surface physics and chemistry appli ed to semiconductor processing technology; semiconductor physics applied to VLSI and analog integrated circuit design, manufacture and quality control; chemical processing and its relation to chemical principles; environmental engineering and chemical identification of minute impurities; environmental and transportation engineering and its relation to public health and public administration; water resources engineering an d geohydrology; and biomedical engineering, to name only a few. The College collaborates with other academic units of the University in research activities and selectively educates students to become proficient in such interdisciplinary fields.

In order to accomplish the first objective, advances in health care increasingly involves the application of emerging science and technology (I.E., Engineering) to clinical problems, including problems in diagnostics treatment and the health care system itself. Unlike more basic research that often aims to increase science and technology knowledge in itself, translational research seeks to specifically address the science and technology needed to solve problems with the end product an actual application or product (of course, adding new significant knowledge in the process). In order to conduct effective biomedical translational research, the investigator must be trained in both clinical science (i.e. the MD Degree) and Engi neering (Specifically Biomedical Engineering). This need has been delineated by both academics and industry and is validated by the growing number of MD/PH.D. (BME) programs nationally. USF has the necessary educational components and research infrastructure for this endeavor; both deg rees are currently available. The proposed program seeks to provide an integrated experience where the student really fells a part of both the medical/clinical and engineering worlds simultaneously, hence the need for an integrated dual degree program.

USF Tampa Graduate Catalog 2013 2014 Section 17 College of Marine Science 628 http://www.marine.usf.edu/ University of South Florida College of Marine Science 140 7th Avenue S, MSL119 St. Petersburg, 5531189 Dean : Jacqueline E. Dixon Director of Academic Affairs: David Naar, Ph.D. Accreditation: The Commission on Colleges of the Southern Association of College and Schools College Structure and Location: The College of Marine Science (CMS) was formed during 2000 from the previous Department of Marine Scien ce, initiated in 1967 with three founding faculty members. The Florida Board of Regents declared it a University Center of Excellence in 1978 and approved the Marine Science Ph.D. program in 1982. The CMS at the University of South Florida is constituted as a graduatelevel resea rch program that forms the basis for educational opportunities at the Ph.D. and M.S. degree levels and for public service to the State of Florida. Located on the beautiful waterfront of Tampa Bay adjacent to the USF St. Petersburg campus, CMS is administratively part of the USF Tampa campus and reports to the Provost of USF. The College is focused on interdisciplinary research in marine science. Our 30 ranked facult y, 11 2 support personnel and roughly 100 graduate students work together toward a vision of understanding the unified global ocean system. The College seeks to build new interdisciplinary research teams in colalboration with our local marine science research partners, include the Florida Fish and Wildlife Research Institute, the U.S. Geological Survery , NOAA, SRI St. Petersburg, and Mote Marine Lab. Mission Statement: The primary mission of the College is to conduct basic and applied research in ocean science. Here, ocean science is defined by application of the traditional fields of science to both the biology, chemistry, geology, and physi cs of the marine environment and to the interactions between the marine environment and the adjoinin g atmosphere and land systems - presently and throughout earth's history. Included in the primary ocean science mission is the development of new technol ogies and tools for exploring the coupl ed ocean atmosphere land systems. The College expects its faculty to develop research programs of outstanding caliber and to fully engage the national and international scientific communities, through the reporting of research results in the most respected oral and written venues, and by profes sional service. Integral to the ocean science research mission is the education of graduate students. The College recruits, trains, and graduates productive, creative scientists at the Ph.D. and M.S. levels that are prepared to make independent contributions to ocean science. The faculty are expected to develop outstanding graduate education programs that will afford students the opportunity to participate in all aspects of research. The College recognizes that graduate education requires strong mentoring along with traditional USF Tampa Graduate Catalog 2013 2014 Section 17 College of Marine Science 629 http://www.marine.usf.edu/ classroom instruction. An ancillary but important mission of the College is education outreach for students at all levels and for the public at large. Our outreach programs have significantly expanded our educational responsibilities, and they are intended to motivate all generations to become scientifically literate citizens and to understand the environment in which they live. The College pursues innovative avenues for educ ational outreach. Efforts are made to attract more junior and senior level undergraduates into both the ocean science core courses and into advanced courses for which they have prerequisites. Historically, this is a way in which students have made career decisions to engage in ocean science. In this manner the College maintains close ties with the student body in other University of Sou th Florida Colleges and campuses. Research Facilities: The College facilities include specilaized laboratories equipped for studies in: Scanning and transmission electron microscopy; Trace metal analysis; Water quality; Organic and isotope geochemistry, chemistry, Additionally, the complex includes the Center for Ocean Technology, which provides manufacturing and prototyping support to the faculty, students and engineers. The College's students and faculty have conducted research in the Antarctic, Arctic, Atlantic, Indian, and Pacific Oceans, as well as the Norwegian, Bering, Mediterranean and Caribbean Seas. The College has access to 5 research vessels in conjunction with the Florida Institute of Oceanography (FIO) and the U.S. geological Survey: The RV Weatherbird II (115 ft), the RV Bellows (71 ft), the RV Gilbert (42 ft), th e RV Fish Hawk (38 ft), and the RV Price (24 ft). Ship time on other vessels in the U.S. fleet of oceanographic vessels, as well as foreign research vessels, is generally obtained through federal funding. Major Research Areas: .

CMS graduates are well prepared for positions in academe, industry, government agencies, and nongovernmental organizations at local to international levels. Biological Oceanography Biological oceanography seeks to understand the life histories and population dynamics of marine organisms and how they interact with their environment over space and time. Scientists in the College of Marine Scie nce study the full breadth of biological oceanography including microbiology, phytoplankton, zooplankton, benthos, coral reefs, fishes, and marine mammals. Our biological oceanographers utilize a variety of techniques including SCUBA, shipboard samplers, acoustics, molecular biology, and mathematical mod eling to understand the oceans and their inhabitants. Scientists in our college also use the latest in remote sensing technology to study vast regions of the Earth's oceans, and have also developed new technology, such as genosensor capable of identifying and quantifying harmful algal blooms and related processes on unprecedented scales. USF Tampa Graduate Catalog 2013 2014 Marine Science (M.S.) 632 http://www.marine.usf.edu/ Chemical Oceanography Chemical oceanographers seek to understand the ways in which various elements are cycled within the oceans, and the reactions that these elements undergo. Ocean chemists improve our understanding of the basic conditions under which ocean life thrives in seawater, and help predict the effects of anthropogenic and natural climate change on ocean composition. Research programs in the C ollege of Marine Science include such wide ranging topics as the role and variability of nutrients in seawater, the distribution and cycling of rare earth elements and other trace metals, examination of the oceans' CO2 system, the study of dissolved organic matter, molecular organic compounds, radionuclides and stable isotopes in the oceans, and the distribution of chemical pollutants and their toxicity on marine organisms and ecosy s tems. Faculty and students utilize a wide variety of stateofthe art instrumentation and technology for investigating these research problems. Geological Oceanography Geological oceanographers in the College of Marine Science conduct research from the continental margins to the deepocean seafloor extending in time from modern environments to millions of years back in Earth's history to understand and predict Earth surface and interior processes. Primary research themes include: (1) paleoceanography and paleoclimatology; (2) coastline and continental shelf development and processes including effects of storms and sealevel fluctuations; (3) the health of modern and recent geologic history of coral reefs and carbonate depositional environments; (4) anthropogenic influences on estuaries; (5) mathematical explanations of geologic phenomena; and (6) plate tectonics. Our geological oceanography group has a variety of modern well equipped laboratories and field equipment, including one of the best seafloor mapping capabilities in the US. Fully integ rated with these field instruments is the computational capability to generate stateofthe art data depictions and imagery. Our group also works closely with scientists from the US Geological Survey's Center for Coastal and Marine Science Center, a major federal laboratory located nearby. Physical Oceano graphy Physical oceanography involves the study of water movement in the ocean. Energy is introduced to the ocean through wind and solar heating, and these combine with the rotation of the Earth and gravitational effects to drive ocean circulation, tides, and waves. Our physical oceanographers also investig ate how the Earth's oceans are directly coupled with the atmosphere, from local weather patterns to the global climate system. Physical oceanographers in the CMS carry out research on a variety of topics using the latest technology. Computer models, real time data, satellite remote sensing, and in situ data from moored arrays, coastal and island tide gauges, and research cruis es are used to study a wide range of research problems. Topics include tide and current prediction in Tampa Bay, circulation on the West Florida Shelf and in the Gulf of Mexico, El Ni\u00f1o, and the potential for global climate change.

In some concentrations, the concentration director will develop the program plan with the student and forward the program plan to the professional advisor. Once a program plan is determined, students are expected to adhere to this plan unless special permission is obtained. As not all courses are offered each semester, a student who deviates from the program plan understands that delay in graduation can be expected Priority is given to students who maintain initial degree plans. Clinical and/or site placements are based on preceptor and/or site availability. While every effort is made to assign students to preceptor/clinical sites near their residence, it is not always possible, and thus, students will need to be flexible. Students may find it useful to meet with the concentration director to understand speciality course focus and/or clinicla course demands and plan accordingly.

Examples of appropriate areas of study for the cognate might be organizational administration, health policy, physiology, cognitive psychology, organizational psychology, gerontology, epidemiology, biostatistics, administration, applied anthropology, educational measurement or a nursing specialty. Electives 36 Credits Students must complete 36 elective credits. Three credits must be in research methods. Suggested courses include: NGR 6824 Data Analysis for Health Sciences, NGR 7932 Current Topics in Quantitative Methods, and NGR 6713 Foundations of Nursng Education. Qualifying Examinations: The qualifying examination is to be complete d as soon as the maj ority of core and minor coursework is completed The purpose of the qualifying examination is to assess the student's level of scholarship and research skills and to determine if the student possesses the critical and analytical skills necessary to undertake the dissertation research. The qualifying examination consists of two parts: Part 1 One qualification for admission to candidacy in the PhD program at USF College of Nursing is the authorship of a scholarly manuscript, suitable for publication in a peerreviewed journal. The manuscript should build upon what is known and so make an original contribution to the know ledge base in nursing and/or other healthcare disciplines. The manuscript may be: an empirical paper reporting on the results of an original study conducted by the student under the supervision of his/her advisor(s), a systematic narrative (i.e. qualitative) or metaanalytic (i.e. quantitative) review of the empirical literatur e relevant to the student's disser tation topic, or a theoretical discussion paper addressing issues germane to the student's dissertation topic. The type and content of the manuscript, as well as the selection of the target journal(s), is to be discussed and decided upon by the student and the members of the student's dissertation committee. Target journals are to be strategically chosen based on the journal's impact factor, target audience, and consideration of other characteristics likely to further the student's career as a researcher. Manuscripts are to be prepared according to the target journal's guidelines for authors. The student nee d not be the sole author but is to be the principal (lead) author on the manuscript. The student is responsible for submission and related correspondence with the target journal. Secondary authorship is appropriate for faculty who provide existing data for the student to analyze, assist in formulating the problem or hypothesis, structuring the study design, organizi ng or conductin g the statistical analysis, and interpreting the results. Lesser contributions that do not warrant secondary authorship include such supportive functions as building/providing equipment, advising about statistical analyses, copy editing, collecting and entering data, recruiting participants, or conducting routine observations, assessments, and/or diagnoses . This motion was approved by the Doctoral Committee on March 12, 2010 and the College of Nursing Faculty Council on March 19, 2010 and is pursuant to the Admission to Candidacy requirement which has previously been a \"soleauthored\" manuscript. Part 2. Preparation and submission of a research grant application for funding to an appropriate agency. The research focus of the grant conten t area is chosen by the student and the dissertation committee and should reflect the area for dissertation research. Determination of the appropriate agency is made in advance by the dissertation committee (examples follow). Students should seek approval of the funding sourc e from their doctoral supervisory committee. The grant must be written to meet the specific grant guidelines of the selected funding agency (a review time of at least 2 weeks should be planned for the dissertation committee). It is the student's responsibility to coordinate submission of the grant with the College of Nursing Resea r ch Center.

This degree requires a minimum of 90 credits beyond the baccalaureate degree. Doctoral programs leading to Ph.D. are offered in all five departments and the five core areas of public healt h. Students have an opportunit y to specialize within their departme nt. Each department has written specific guidelines and there are collegewide PhD student competencies. Students and their major advisor jointly create a written plan to meet all competencies via plan of study, research experience, departmental and professional activities, and other appro p riate methods. Ph.D. Course of Study: The student's course of study will include the following: Prerequisites: A minimum of Biostatistics I, Epidemiology, and one other selected college core courses are required by all students who do not have a master's degree in public health. The doctoral committee or the department may require ot her prerequisites. These courses are not included in the minimum number of hours a student needs to complete the Ph.D. and are expected to be completed early in the course of study. Required Coursework: The courses and number of credit hours required are defined by the departme nt and the doctoral committee and include coursework from ano ther department or college. There must be minimum of 13 credits at the 7000 level. Generally, the doctoral degree requires a minimum of 90 credits beyond the bachelor's degree. Departments determine the number of credits accepted from previous master(s) degree. There is a mandatory doctoral student orientati on that all new doctoral students must attend in the fall semester of their first academic year. All doctoral students take a minimum of three semesters (one credit each semester) of a college wide Advanced Interdisciplinary Seminar in Public Health. Tools of Research: Departmental Guidelines will address whether tools of research are required for doctoral students within that departme nt (consistency within the d epartment required). The student must complete a minimum of two of the \"Tools of Research\" options designated by the department, and approved by the doctoral committee before the student is eligible to take the doctoral qualifying examination.

Public health professionals can better perform these functions through not only obtaining the prerequisite knowledge but also through partnering with welltrained professionals in other fields such as law to develop and implement society's responses to public health needs. However, lawyers' effectiveness is often limite d by their inadequate knowledge of public health and its scientific disciplines. The joint degree program is intended to supply this knowledge by giving public health and Stetson Law School graduates a sound education in both law and public health. A related goal is to increase the opportunities for interdisciplinary research, teaching, and advocacy for the fa culties at the College of Public Health and Stetson University College of Law.

ADMISSION INFORMATION Must meet University requirements (see Graduate Admissions) as well as requirements listed below. Program Admission Requirements Students will need to be accepted to both institutions and follow the admission standards of each setting. Students must complete the GRE and the LSAT for acceptance into this dual program. Refer to the M.P.H. listing for specific USF admission requirements. DEGREE PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS College of Public Health Students : Students in the College of Public Health will enroll in the J.D./M.P.H. program, complete the M.P.H. degree, and meet the admission requirements of Stetson which includes taking the LSAT, and then enroll in the Stetson College of Law to complete the JD. Students in the dual degree program will be permitted to count nine hours of credit from the M.P.H. program toward satisfaction of JD cred it requirements, and up to nine hours of credit from the JD program toward satisfaction of M.P.H. credit requirements. All students in the dual degree program must complete a field experience requirement. Students in Stetson Law must do mandatory pro bono work (20 hours). Some of these hours may qualify for the field experience however these must be done in a public health setting. This will be determined by the student's public health advisor and department. Credit hours for the M.P.H. may be more than 42 hours (i.e. 46 hours) depending on the concen tration program. Stetson Law Students : Students already enrolled in Stetson College of Law will normally apply for the dual degree program in their first or second year. Students in the program will usually complete either one or two years of law school, after which they will spend a year completing the M.P.H. program in the Colle g e of Public Health. Students will have the ability to choose whichever concentration within the College that best meets their interests and needs and which they are formally accepted to by the College and Department. After completing their M.P.H., students will return to Stetson to complete their JD and prep are for the bar exam. The virtue of this study plan is that students will commence M.P.H. study with a sound foundation in law and legal process, and students will complete the elective portion of their legal study with a sound foundation in public health.

USF Tampa Graduate Catalog 2013 2014 Public Health (Dr.P.H.) 769 http://health.usf.edu/publichealth/ PreDissertation Committee All Dr.P.H. students are admitted into the College of Public Health Dr.P.H. will be assigned a faculty advisor (see above) and a Dr.P.H. practicebased Mentor who will work with the student in forming a predissertation committee. The roles of the predissertation committee are as follows: 1. Meet with the student to discuss plan of study, practicebase specialized study, and academic progress. The Prog ram of Stud y should include proposed time schedule to complete each course, and copies shall be given to each committee member and to the Office of Academic and Student Affairs. 2. Facilitate opportunities for strengthening leadership and management skills, applied research skills and scholarly growth. 3. Administer and evaluate the qualifying exam. Dissertation Committee Successful completion of the preliminary examination advances the doctoral student to a doctoral candidate. At that time, the student will convene a Dr.P.H. Dissertation Committee. The PreDissertation Committee may continue to serve as the Dissertation Committee, although this not necessary. At this time, the student may desire to change Faculty Advisor and/or committee members. This may occur when practice , professional or research interests are more closely matched with another faculty member, the student and faculty member mutually agree that another person is more appropriate, or a faculty member is leaving the University. This action is to be approved by the Department Chair, the Dean of Acad emic and Student Affairs, and the Office of Graduate Studies. The Dissertation Committee must have a minimum of four members, which includes at least two faculty members from the College of Public Health and a public health profe ssional or practitioner. Refer to Office of Graduate Studies guidelines for information on the chair appointed for the dissertation defense. A minimum of 9 dissertation credits is required. The roles of the dissertation committee are as follows: 1. Guide student throughout practicebased dissertation. 2. Approve written dissertation proposal through a formal oral presentation process. 3. Provide gui dance and support during dissertation 4. Evaluate dissertation through dissertation defense process. 5. Recommend an appropriate chair for the dissertation defense. Use of \"c\" in Degree Acronyms for Degree Candidates The College of Public Health does not permit students who are pursuing mast ers or doctoral degrees to use the degree acronym after their names and a small \"c\" for candidate. In order words students are not permitted to use MPHc, MSPHc, MHA, PhDc, or DrPHc. If students, after successfully completing all comprehensive exams (core and concentration) for the master degrees or the qualifying exam for the doctoral degree wish to put after their name the words \"mast er degree candidate\" or \"doctoral degree candidate*\" - we allow this. The use of the degree acronym and small \"c\" creates confusion for faculty, employers, and other individuals who are reviewing students' CVS and other materials. It creates a situation wherein a student appears to have earned a degree when such is not the case. As a degreegranting College, we do not allow this. *Editor's note: the use of \"doctoral degree candidates\" should only be done after Admission to Doctoral Candi d acy has been processed and approved through the Office of Graduate Studies.

USF Tampa Graduate Catalog 2013 2014 Architecture (M.Arch.) 778 http://www.arts.usf.edu/ OTHER REQUIREMENTS Computers The School of Architecture and Community Design requires each student enrolled in the Advanced Design Studios level, or higher, to possess (through purchase or lease) a NOTEBOOK COMPUTER system. The notebook computer requirement allows students to conduct the majority of digital work, which is an integral aspect of advanced architectural design education and professional practice, in the design studio. The studio is the primary place for the exchange of design ideas, crit ique, and synthesis, and the Architecture faculty believes that the student's regular presence in the studio is critical for maximizing her or his architectural design learning. The notebook system is required in lieu of a desktop in order to address the limited design studio spac e available to each student. The mobility of the notebook allows the student to easily and quickly transform a relatively small desk space into a variety of configurations suitable for physical modelmaking, handdrawing, handdrafting, design research, and design writing as well as digital drawing, mode ling , and graphic design. The batterypowered notebook allows for maximum computer use within environments with limited electrical power outlets. The School will continue to maintain highpowered computer systems in the laboratory for intensive computing required for manipulating large digital models, renderings, etc. Students may begin their digital work on their laptops and, if needed, use removable storage and network connections to tran sfer files to the lab systems for final development. The School provides black and white printers, color and black and white plotters, and scanners in the computer laboratory. Because the notebook computer system is an educational requirement of the School, the cost of a new computer purchase can be factored in determining a student's financial need. The student must contact the USF Office of Financial Aid (813974 4700) to request additional information and a \"Budget Adjustment for Computer Purchase\" form prior to ordering a computer. The decis ion regarding a student's budget adjustment may take 68 weeks, so students are strongly encouraged to plan ahead. Only one financial aid budget adjustment up to $2,500 for a new computer can be issued during a three year period. Portfolios The faculty requires the submission of portfolios of academic work by each student at two formal portfolio review s. Students mu st pass these portfolio reviews in order to advance in the program. The portfolio policy can be found on the School's website. Students are advised to prepare their design work for inclusion in their portfolios at the end of each design semester, instead of waiting until just before the portfolio due dates. Some expense, varying widely according to reproduction technique and/or ambition, should be anticipated. Field Trips Each year students in the fall term beginning students in take a field trip to Savannah, GA. Transportation, lodging and meals ($200300) are paid by the students. Students in desi gn studios take field trips to such cities as New York, Boston and Chicago in the spring. The cost of these trips may be $200 600 per student. Student Work Student work, submitted to the School in satisfaction of course or degree requ i rements, becomes the physical property of the School. This work may include papers, drawings, models, and other materials in either physical or electronic form. The School assumes no responsibility for safeguarding such materials. At its discretion, this School may retain, return, or discard such materials. The School will not normally discard the materials of currentl y enrolled students without giving the student a chance to reclaim them. GPA of 3.00 in Design In addition to the statewide requirement that students maintain an overall grade point average(GPA) of 3.00 or better, the Architecture faculty also requires that students maintain a GPA of 3.00 or better in all design courses.

M.F.A. RESEARCH PROJECT: Exhibition/Orals/Written Document OTHER REQUIREMENTS A course in 20th Century Art History should have been successfully completed at the undergraduate level prior to entering the M.F.A. program. If not, new students must enroll in the USF course during the first year of graduate study. However, financial aid awards will not cover the cost of the course and it cannot be used to satisfy the 60 credits required for the M.F.A. de gree. The School of Art and Art History highly recommends that all students seeking an advanced degree in Art take a minimum of one course in Electronic Media. The remainder of the program is discretionary and can be planned with the advice of the Graduate Art Advisor in its initial stages. After faculty acceptance of the student's M.F.A. Proposed Re search Project, a Graduate Supervisory Committee selected by the student will serve in an advisory capacity to the student for planning the rest of his/her program. DIRECTED STUDIES As part of the student's studio and discretionary electives, he/sh e may register with a faculty member un der a Directed Study Contract. The descriptions for Directed Study are as follows: ART 6940, Selected Topics in Art, Grading option Regular (For a grade), 14 credits Suitable for coursework by contract in an area in which the student has prior skill. ART 5910, Rese arch, Grading option Regular, 14 credits Suitable for coursework by contract in an area in which the student has little or no prior skill. ART 6940 and ART 5910 are the only variable credit contracts that M.F.A. students should use until they have formed their Supervisory Committees, as they are the only variab le credit contracts with the regular grading option. All M.F.A. students are required to take coursework for a grade until they have formed their Supervisory Committees. ART 6907, Independent Study, Grading option S/U, 119 credits. Suitable for graduate level coursework in any area for which the student does not wish a letter grade, or which justifies more than 4 hours of credit. May be used only after the student's Supervisory Committee is formed. (See S/U Grades) ART 6911, Directed Research, Grading option S/U, 119 credits. Suitable for graduate level coursework in any area for which the student does not wish a letter grade, or which USF Tampa Graduate Catalog 2013 2014 Art (M.F.A.) 781 http://www.arts.usf.edu/ justifies more than 4 hours of credit. May be used only after the student's Supervisory Committee is formed. (See S/U Grades) In practice, ART 6907 and ART 6911 are used interchangeably. As noted, they are not for use by M.F.A. students who have not yet established their Supervisory Committees. The other, media specific, course numbers such as Sculpture or Painting are not often used as they are fixed at 4 credit hours. When they are used it is the policy of the School that they be taken by contract. Transfer Credits Requests for use of transfer credits or credits earned under \"special\" (aka nondegree seeking) student status should be made when the student applie s to the gradua te program. The faculty will decide at the time of admission whether or not transfer credits and credits earned as a special student will be used toward the requirements for the M.F.A. degree. Transfer credit and credit earned as a special student to be used toward the students' M.F.A. degree is limite d to 8 semester hours. SU GRADES A Student may not take any course work for a grade of \"S/U\" until they have elected a supervisory committee, usually by the fourth semester. All course work taken durin g the first th ree semesters must be taken in course work assigning letter grades that designate quality points. Appropriate contract numbers would include graduate level studios such as Sculpture or Painting, and ART 5910 for an area in which a graduate student did not have prior skill, or ART 6940 for studies in an area where prior skill exists but the student requires variable credit or the research does not conform to cle ar categorization by discipline. ART 6907 Independent Study and ART 6911 Directed Research offer only the S/U grading option and are not to be used until after the student has elected a supervisory committee. FACULTY EVALUATIONS AT THE END OF FIRST, SECOND AND THIRD SEMESTERS At the end of the first, second and third semesters, students will receive a written evaluation from a faculty committee regarding their progress in the program based on a presentation of their work. A student receiving \"unsatisfactory\" grades for the first year and third semester evaluations will be dropped from the program. M.F.A. RESEARCH PROJECT PROPOSALS During the fourth semester students will present a proposal for their MFA Research Projec t. The s tudent must present a body of work and written paper supporting the student's proposed direction. If a student's proposal is satisfactory, he/she will select a graduate Supervisory Committee to oversee the realization of the research project. If a student's project proposal is not satisfactory, another proposal can be prese nted before the end of the fourth semester. If the student's proposal and reproposal are voted unsatisfactory the student will be dismissed from the program. GRADUATE SUPERVISORY COMMITTEES The Graduate Supervisory Committee consists of a chair and two members from the Studio Art faculty. The Supervisory Committee must be approved by the MFA Program Director. M.F.A. RESEARCH PROJECT EX HIBITION/ORALS/WRITTEN DOCUMENT The exhibition, written document and the orals conclude the student's graduate program and take place after all course work is completed. The exhibition is usually during the term the student plans to graduate, typically the seco nd semester of the third year. M.F.A. Research Project exhibitions cannot be scheduled for the summer term.

The focus of all art history courses and programs is on the intellectual and cultural history of art. Course work is supplemented by practical internships in galleries and museums as well as studyabroad programs. Proficiency in a foreign language relevant to the student's area of specialization is required. Stud ents consult with their advisors to determine the foreign language most appropriate to their scholarly interests. Accreditation: Accredited by the Commission on Colleges of the Southern Association of College and Schools; National Association of Schools of Art and Design. Major Research Areas: M.A. Art History students are guid ed by the art history faculty in selecting their area of research after completing a year of graduate study. Because the focus of the Art History M.A. Program is on the cultural and intellectual history of art, graduate thesis work is expected to address an area of art from a contemporary perspective that is complimen tary. This program fe atures an endowed chair in modern and contemporary art history. ADMISSION INFORMATION Admission is competitive. Student must at least meet University requirements (see Graduate Admissions) as well as requirements listed below. Program Admission Requirements Departmental Requirements plus a research paper dealing directly with Art History or a related discipline (literature, political history, psychology, philosophy or classical studies). Three letters of recommendation from people who can professionally assess the applicant's ability to do scholarly and academic work. A short essay of one to two pages explaining the applicant's research interests and goals for grad uate study in art history. A personal interview by the Art History faculty may be requested. USF Tampa Graduate Catalog 2013 2014 Art History (M.A.) 783 http://www.arts.usf.edu/ Undergraduate Deficiencies in Art History Students pursuing graduate studies in Art History, who do not have an undergraduate degree in Art History will be expected to complete four undergraduate Art History survey courses plus two courses in critical studies. Exceptions can be granted only with consent of the Art History faculty. Language Requirem e nts Reading knowledge of the foreign language most relevant for study and research in the student's area of specialization must be acquired before the end of the second semester of enrollment in the program. Please see the Academic Advisor for exceptions to this rule. The student may take appropriate courses in the Division of Language or Classics Program. Whenever the courses are available, the student should be encouraged to take one of the special one semester foreign language co urses designed for graduate students. When these courses are not available, the student may take two semesters of a beginning foreign language course. These courses may not be taken pass/fail or audit. In order to fulfill the foreign language requirement, the student must receive a letter grade of \"B\" or better in both courses. Courses taken to fulfill the foreign language requir e ment will not count toward hours necessary for graduation and the grades in these courses will not be computed in the student's graduate GPA. Students may elect to take the GSFLT (Graduate School Foreign Language Test). The student must achieve a score of 450 or above on the test in order to fulfill the foreign language requirement. Students may take a proficiency exam in which they translate, from a foreign language into English, materials relevant to their particular disciplines. The form of these proficiency exams should be devised by the appropriate language professors from either of these two units.

A student should, if possible, have at least one graduate class in these three areas: 1) Ancient/Medieval 2) Early Modern (15th18th centuries) 3) Modern (1921st centuries). USF Tampa Graduate Catalog 2013 2014 Art History (M.A.) 784 http://www.arts.usf.edu/ Museum experience is encouraged for all students, but course credit for museum internships is limited to those seeking a Certificate in Museum Studies. Thesis and Qualifying paper options Students either write a qualifying paper or thesis to complete the requirements of the M.A. program. Students should consult with the Director of the Graduate Program and the faculty to determine which option is the best for them; the final dec ision rests with the faculty. For either option, a B+ average or above is required in courses taken to fulfill Program graduate credits, for students to move on to this final phase of their graduate studies. The M.A. in Art History is a twoyear program for students who attend full time, but the thesis option often takes long er to complete. Qualifying paper option Requires 8 seminars in art history (32 hours), with 8 additional hours of electives, plus 2 hours for preparing the qualifying paper (in the fourth and final semester). The qualifying paper should demonstrate the st udent's ability to do significant arthistorical research, to persuade by effective use of evidence and argument, and to write fluently and clearly. The qualifying paper will usually be a substantially revised seminar paper and should be about 1520 typed pages in length, excluding endnotes, bibliography, illustrations or other materials. Students choosing this option should form a qualifying pape r committee by the end of the second semester of their first year. The Committee is composed of a major professor and a second faculty member. Members of the Committee are faculty in the School of Art and Art History, of which one must be tenured or tenureearning. The major professor will usually be the profes sor who oversaw the writing of the original seminar paper. Students pursuing this option download the relevant form at http://www.arts.usf.edu/ab solutenm/articlefiles/20 GradComApptFrm.pdf . Students are responsible for collectin g committee members' signatures. The M.A. Program Director must authorize all committee assignments with his/her signature. When submitting drafts of the qualifying paper to committee members, students must allow faculty members two weeks to read any given version. Remember that first drafts usually have to be extensively revised, often several times, before the qualifying paper is accepted. Faculty are not normally available during the summ er to read qualifying paper drafts. The qualifying paper committee must approve the qualifying paper before the student can graduate. Qualifying papers must be submitted two weeks before the last day of classes of the semester in which the student wishes to graduate. The major professor, in consultation with the other faculty member, notifies the Academic Advisor of the School of Art and Art History of approval of the paper before the end of the semester. If a paper is not approved, the student may revise and resubmit it a second time. It is the student's responsibility to stay abreast of Graduate School deadline s and registration requirements in the final semester, which are available online at http://www.grad.usf.edu . Thesis option Requires six seminars in art history (24 hours), with 8 additional hours of electives, plus 6 hours of thesis writing (4 hours in the third semester and 2 hours in the fourth and final semester). Students writing the thesis should work with faculty during the second semester to begin developing potential topics. By the end of the first year, students who wish to wri te the thesis should decide on a thesis topic with a major professor from the art history faculty. The topic is usually related to research done in a seminar. During the following summer students prepare the thesis proposal. The proposal should define a significant research problem and explain how the top ic has the potential to contribute to scholarship in the field; it must include a research plan and a critical review of the scholarly literature on the subject area. Thesis proposals will be presented to faculty and fellow graduate students in a public forum at the beginning of the third semester. Each presentation is followed by discussion, which provides an opportunity for students to receive suggestions and recommendations from faculty and peers. If the proposal is declined, the student will be eligible to pursue a Qualifying Paper. If the art history faculty approves the thesis topic, the student should form a thesis committee by the end of the semester in which they have successfully proposed a thesis topic, and have thereby achieved thesis candidacy. USF Tampa Graduate Catalog 2013 2014 Art History (M.A.) 785 http://www.arts.usf.edu/ The committee is composed of at least two members and the major professor. The major professor and at least one other committee member must be chosen from tenured or tenureearning art history faculty, or otherwise as approved by the Director of the M.A. program. Students forming the thesis committee download the relevant form at http://www.arts.usf.edu/absolutenm/articlefiles/20 GradCom ApptFrm.pdf . Students are responsible for collecting committee members' signatures. The M.A. Program Director must authorize all committee assignments with his/her signature. While moderate in length and considerably more limited in scope than a doctoral dissertation, the M.A. thesis must demonstrate the student's ability to do original, independent research of publishable quality. The thesis should be approximately 3540 typed pages of text - the usual length of a journal article excluding notes, bibliography, illustrati ons or other materials. When submitting drafts of the thesis to committee members, students must allow faculty members two weeks to read any given version. Remember that first drafts will have to be extensively revised several times before the thesis is accepted. Faculty are not no rmally available during the summer to read thesis drafts. The thesis committee must approve the final thesis before the student may schedule a date for the M.A. thesis defense. The examining committee will consist of the thesis committee and at least two additional questioners who are chosen by the student in consultation with the thesis committee. Students should keep in mind that the questioners mus t also be allowed two weeks to read the draft of the thesis after it is accepted for the defense by the thesis committee. The oral defense is open to the public. No defenses are scheduled during the summer. Immediately after the orals, the examining committee meets to determine whether the student has passed the oral examination and whether the thesis is acceptable in its current form. NOTE: It is usually necessary to make some changes in the thesis after the oral defense. Allow at least one week between the oral exam and the Graduate School de adline so that you will be able to make the changes. Ideally, the student will complete the thesis and submit it in the fourth semester. It is the student's responsibility to stay abreast of Graduate School deadlines and regis t ration requirements in the final semester. Check with the USF Graduate School for specific deadlines and requirements for the M.A. thesis and graduation. These are available online at http://www.grad.usf.edu/newsite/thesis.asp. All theses must be submitted electronically. Transfer of Credit There is no automatic transfer of special student credit or graduate credit earned at other instit utions or from other graduate program in the university towards M.A. degree requirements. The School of Art and Art History has designated a six hour limit on all credit taken as special student status. Any transfer of credit or special student hours to be used toward M.A. degree requirements are only granted after a faculty review at the time the student has been accepted into the M.A. program.

The program focuses on the myriad physical, functional, visual, social and sustainable circumstances in contemporary urban contexts and stresses the amassing of knowledge, and the acquisition of design , research, analytical and other practical skills. The instructional scope of the MUCD program is both broad and diverse. The program builds on previous studies in architecture or landscape architecture as the foundation for involving students in crafting design interventions across the varied spectrum of scales of urbanism - from the urban street and bloc k, up to the metropolitan region. Support courses in the program's curriculum infuse an understanding of the fundamentals of urban and community design, the historical and theoretical foundations of the discipline, the methods of research and analysis used in urban and community design, the major determinants of urban form, the evolution of urban contexts, and the different modes of contemporary urban design practice. The Program invites applications from prospective students who are interested in expanding their understanding of the physical dimensions of urbanism and the morphology of urban places, and amassing the skills necessary in crafting compelling design interventions that address the human expe rience and physical conditions of cities, towns and communities.

SCNS website: http://scns.fldoe.org/scns/public/pb_inst_dtl.jsp Courses offered for credit by the University of South Florida are listed with the program or college that offers them. The first line of each description includes the State Common Course prefix and number (see below), title of the course, and number of credits. Florida's Statewide Course Numbering System Courses in this catalog are identified by prefixes and numb ers were assigned by Florida's Statewide Course Numbering System. This common numbering system is used by all public postsecondary institutions in Florida and by participating non public institutions. The major purpose of this system is to facilitate the transfer of courses between participating institutions. Each participating institution contro ls the title, credit, and content of its own courses and recommends the first digit of the course number to indicate the level at which students normally take the course. Course prefixes and the last three digits of the course numbers are assigned by members of faculty discipline committees appointed for that purpose by the Florida Department of Education in Tallahassee. Individuals nominated to serve on these committees are sele cted to maintain a representative balance as to type of institution and discipline field or specialization. The course prefix and each digit in the course number have a meaning in the Statewide Course Numbering System (SCNS). The list of course prefixes and nu mbers, along with their generic titles, is referred to as the \"SCNS taxonomy.\" Descriptions of the content of courses are referred to as \"statewide course details.\" Courses are created using the State Course wide Numbering System (SCNS). The following information is from the SCNS Handbook. For more information visit their website at: http://scns.fldoe.org/scns/public/pb_index.jsp# The SCNS uses a course designation which consists of a threeletter prefix and a four digit number and, when necessary, a oneletter laboratory (L) or lecture/laboratory (C) suffix. Example: SCNS COURSE ID AML Content Suffix Explanation: AML 6017, Studies in American Literature to 1860 American Studies course taught at the graduate level (no lab). A level code, which roughly corresponds to the year in college the course is normally taken (i.e., masters, doctoral, etc.), is placed between the course prefix and the course number. The level is recommen ded by the institution according to its own policies and the policies of the State of Florida, and approved by the faculty committee. The level digit does not affect course equivalency - course equivalency is determined by the prefix and the last three digits . The following are the level definitions: 0 PSAV, co llege prep, vocational prep 12 Lower level undergraduate 34 Upper level undergraduate 59 Graduate and Professional (see definitions on the next page) USF Tampa Graduate Catalog 2013 2014 Section 25 Graduate Course Information 806 Courses are numbered based on content, rather than by department or program. This means that a single program may have courses in several different disciplines and may consist of courses having several different prefixes. Glossary of Course Description Terms Credits separated by a colon indicate concurrent lecture and laboratory courses taught as a unit: PHY 3040, 3040L PHYSICS AND LAB (3:1) Credits separated by a comma indicate unified course s offered in different se mesters: AMH 2010, 2020 AMERICAN HISTORY I, II (4, 4) Credits separated by a hyphen indicate variable credit: MAT 7912 DIRECTED RESEARCH Var.

The courses presuppose different audiences, and the intention is to offer them at distinct levels. 5000 5999 Typically Intro ductory Graduate Level Courses 6000 6999 Typically Mast er's level Cour ses 7000 7999 Typically Doctoral level Courses The University reserves the right to substitute, not offer, and add courses and programs that are listed in this catalog. USF Tampa Graduate Catalog 2013 2014 Section 25 Graduate Course Information 807 Example of Course Identifier Prefix Level Code (first digit) Century Digit (second digit) Decade Digit (third digit) Unit Digit (fourth digit) Lab Code SYG 1 0 1 0 Sociology, General Freshman Level at this institution Entrylevel General Sociology Survey Course Social Problems No lab in this course General Rule for Course Equivalencies Equivalent courses at different institutions are identified by the same prefixes and same last three digits of the course number and are guaranteed to be transferable between participating institutions that offer the course, with a few exceptions. (Exceptions are listed below.) For example, a survey course in social problems is offered by 34 different postsecondary instituti o ns. Each institution uses \"SYG_010\" to identify its social problems course. The level code is the first digit and represents the year in which students normally take the course at a specific institution. In the SCNS taxonomy, \"SYG\" means \"Sociology, General,\" the century Sociology,\" the decade digit \"1\" represents Course,\" and the unit digit \"0\" represents \"Social Problems.\" In science and other areas, a \"C\" or \"L\" after the course number is known as a lab indicator. The \"C\" represents a combined lecture and laboratory course. The \"L\" represents a laboratory course or the laboratory part of a course, ha ving the same prefix and course number without a lab indicator, which may meet at a different time or place. Transfer of any successfully completed course from one institution to another is guaranteed in cases where the course to be transferred is equivalent to one offered by the receiving institution. Equivalencies are es tablished by the same prefix and last three digits and comparable faculty credentials at both institutions. For example, SYG 1010 is offered at a community college while the same course is offered at a state university as SYG 2010. A student who has successfully comple ted SYG 1010 at the community college is guaranteed to receive transfer credit for SYG 2010 at the state university upon transfer. The student cannot be required to take SYG 2010 again since SYG 1010 is equivalent to SYG 2010. Transfer credit must be awarded for succe ssfully compl eted equivalent courses and used by the receiving institution to determine satisfaction of requirements on the same basis as credit awarded to the native students. It is the prerogative of the receiving institution to offer transfer credit for courses successfully completed which have not been designated as equivalent. The Course Prefix The cours e prefix is a threeletter designator for a major division of an academic discipline, subject matter area, or sub category of knowledge. The prefix is not intended to identify the department in which a course is offered. Rather, the content of a course determines the prefix designation. Authority for Acceptan ce of Equivalent Courses State Board of Education Rule 6A10.024(19), Florida Administrative Code, reads: When a student transfers among postsecondary institutions that are fully accredited by a regional or national accrediting agency recognized by the United States Department of Education and that participate in the common course designation and numbering system, the rece iving institution shall award credit for courses satisfactorily completed at the previous participating institutions when the courses are judged by the appropriate common course designation and numbering system faculty task forces to be academically equivalent to courses offered at the receiving institution, including equivalency of faculty credentials, regardless of the public or nonpublic control of the previous institution. The award of cre dit may be limited to courses that are entered in the course numbering system. Credits so awarded shall satisfy institutional requirements on the same basis as credits awarded to native students. Exceptions to the General Rule for Equival ency The following courses are exceptions to the general rule for course equivalencies and may not transfer. Transferability is at the discretion of the receiving institution: Courses in the 900999 series(e.g., HUM 2905) Internships, practica, clinical experiences, and study abroad cours es Performance or studio course s in Art, Dance, Th eater, and Music USF Tampa Graduate Catalog 2013 2014 Section 25 Graduate Course Information 808 Skills courses in Criminal Justice Graduate courses Courses not offered by the receiving institution College preparatory and vocational preparatory course may not be used to meet degree requirements and are not transferable.
