Food allergies affect both adults and children and can be defined as an adverse health effect arising from a specific immune response that occurs reproducibly on exposure to a given food [ [2](#B2)]. [3](#B3)]. An important differentiation in the management of milk hypersensitivities is between allergy and intolerance [ [1](#B1)]. CMPA is a reproducible clinically abnormal reaction to cow's milk protein (CMP) due to the interaction between one or more milk proteins and one or more immune mechanisms, while intolerance is a non-allergic food sensitivity as the result of lactase deficiency, the dietary enzyme required to digest lactose which is the predominant sugar in milk [ [2](#B2)]. Epidemiology [4](#B4)]. These diseases include asthma, rhinitis, anaphylaxis, eczema, urticaria, angioedema, and drug, food, and insect allergy. This increase is especially problematic in children, who are bearing the greatest burden of the rising trend which has occurred over the past two decades. [1](#B1)]. European prospective cohort studies from the past 15 years suggest that the prevalence of CMPA is between 1.9% and 4.9% [ [5](#B5)]. This is consistent with a meta-analysis which found that CMPA is the most common food allergy in early childhood with an incidence of 2-3% in the first year of life [ [6](#B6)]. While there are indirect data favoring an increase in CMPA prevalence, knowledge of the time trend of CMPA prevalence is very limited and there are no unequivocal data to suggest an increase. Etiology and pathophysiology [2](#B2)]. Allergy can be immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated or non-IgE-mediated. IgE-mediated allergy is associated with manifestations as vomiting, diarrhea, eczema, rhinitis, and anaphylaxis [ [7](#B7)]. Non-IgE-mediated allergy is some infants, irritability and colic may be the only symptoms of food allergy [ [8](#B8)]. [7](#B7)]; however, it has not been demonstrated that there is an increased risk for CMPA if there is a positive family history. A genetic basis for atopic disease is supported by twin studies which show that allergies such as asthma, eczema, and hay fever correlate more highly in monozygotic than dizygotic twins irrespective of whether the monozygotic twins were raised together or apart [ [9](#B9)]. [7](#B7)]. This is thought to be the result of regional allergic response leading to systemic allergic inflammation. [7](#B7), [10](#B10), [11](#B11)] and management [ [1](#B1), [2](#B2), [7](#B7)] of CMPA. Regionally within the Middle East there is a lack of focus on infant allergy, with limited studies on epidemiology, prevention, diagnosis, and treatment. There are no regional publications of guideline recommendations. There is, therefore, a need for region-specific recommendations for the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of allergy which assess the latest available literature and tailor it to the region with due consideration of local experiences and challenges. These guidelines are created to reflect the issues that are specific to the region, such as cultural differences, epidemiological differences, lack of healthcare practitioner and parental awareness, and product availability and affordability. The objective of this manuscript is to provide clinical guidelines on the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of CMPA for the region. METHODS PREVENTION OF COW'S MILK PROTEIN ALLERGY [Table 1](#T1)). Historical data show that the incidence of atopic disease is around 15%; however, this is increased in infants with a family history of atopic disease. Risk is increased to 20-40% if one parent has a history of atopy, to 40-50% if both parents have a history of atopy, and to 70-80% if both parents have a history of the same atopic disease [ [12](#B12), [13](#B13)]. There are no recent data on the familial risk of atopic disease. Furthermore, if a child within a family has an allergy, the risk of allergy in subsequent siblings is 10 times higher than that within the general population [ [14](#B14)]. There is no available evidence that risk of CMPA is higher in those with a family history of CMPA versus a family history of atopic disease as these studies have not been performed. [15](#B15)]. This finding is supported by meta-analyses which show that breastfeeding is associated with a decreased risk of atopic dermatitis compared with conventional formula feeding [ [16](#B16)]. [2](#B2), [10](#B10), [11](#B11)]. Studies have failed to demonstrate that modulation of maternal diet decreases incidence of allergy [ [17](#B17), [18](#B18)]. Furthermore, a systematic review of studies of maternal diet restriction found that restriction was associated with a statistically significantly lower mean gestational weight gain and therefore a maternal restriction in diet may risk an unbalanced diet that affects one or both of fetal and maternal nutrition [ [19](#B19)]. [2](#B2), [10](#B10), [11](#B11)]. A number of studies have demonstrated the efficacy of using both partially hydrolyzed formula (pHF) and extensively hydrolyzed formula (eHF) for the prevention of allergy in infants at high risk of allergy [ [20](#B20), [21](#B21)]. Some of the most compelling data come from the GINI study. In infants with a hereditary risk for allergy randomly assigned to standard CMF, a partial hydrolysate, or one of two extensive hydrolysates, the incidence of atopic dermatitis was significantly reduced in those receiving the pHF or one of the eHF formulae [ [15](#B15)]. Follow-up studies at both 6 years and 10 years have shown that this effect is without rebound [ [15](#B15)]. [22](#B22), [23](#B23), [24](#B24)]. Despite this, most guidelines acknowledge that there is modest evidence for hydrolyzed formulae in the prevention of atopic dermatitis and support their recommendation in infants at risk of allergy [ [2](#B2), [10](#B10), [11](#B11)]. [25](#B25)]. Extensively hydrolyzed formulae are further hydrolyzed for greater hypoallergenicity, but key considerations in their use are the increased cost over pHF [ [26](#B26)] and their reduced palatability [ [27](#B27)]. Furthermore, it has been suggested that the reduced immunogenicity of eHF may prevent the immune system from developing tolerance to milk proteins [ [25](#B25)]; however, a recent study has shown that eHF does induce tolerance in symptomatic sensitized infants when used in the treatment of CMPA [ [28](#B28)]. Amino acid formulae (AAF) have been developed to overcome the hypersensitivity that can arise from the residual proteins in eHF [ [29](#B29)]; however, these are more expensive, have no evidence to support their efficacy in prevention of CMPA, and are therefore not recommended for prevention of CMPA. [30](#B30), [31](#B31)], other studies suggest that early introduction has no adverse effect and may even protect against allergy [ [32](#B32), [33](#B33), [34](#B34), [35](#B35), [36](#B36)]. Furthermore, it is suggested that restricting developmentally appropriate solid food variety beyond age 6 months can lead to inadequate nutrient intake, growth deficits, and feeding problems [ [2](#B2)]. On balance, the evidence suggests that there is not a strong benefit in delaying introduction or imposing specific restriction of potentially allergenic food beyond 4-6 months (17-27 weeks). [37](#B37)]. There are studies to suggest that probiotic supplementation of mothers during pregnancy and lactation may prevent early atopic disease in infants [ [38](#B38)]. There is also evidence to suggest that supplementation of eHF with prebiotics may decrease incidence allergic manifestations, including of atopic dermatitis, recurrent wheezing, and allergic urticaria in infancy [ [39](#B39)]. There are no studies published that demonstrate whether this is also true of pHF supplemented with prebiotics. These data suggest that prebiotics and probiotics are safe and, while there is some evidence that they may reduce incidence of allergy, further evidence is required before they can become routine recommendation [ [37](#B37)]. Consensus recommendations [Fig. 1](#F1). DIAGNOSIS OF COW'S MILK PROTEIN ALLERGY [3](#B3), [6](#B6)]. This suggests a need for appropriate diagnostic elimination and challenge procedures in the diagnosis of CMPA. [40](#B40)]. For diagnosis of CMPA there is a need for an appropriate diagnostic work-up, including family history and a physical examination. There is no one symptom pathognomonic of CMPA; it can present with an array of symptoms affecting different organ systems - typically the skin, respiratory, and gastrointestinal tracts-with many infants developing symptoms in more than one organ system. Anaphylaxis in CMPA is rare, and infants with life-threatening symptoms or anaphylaxis should be immediately referred to the nearest emergency department [ [2](#B2), [41](#B41)]. Diagnosis of CMPA should be made on the basis of symptoms [ [2](#B2), [7](#B7), [40](#B40)]. [42](#B42)]. Specific IgE testing helps to confirm diagnosis in IgE-mediated allergy, and prick tests can be used to add value to the diagnosis, but positive results are not necessarily predictive for food challenge outcome [ [43](#B43), [44](#B44)]. Other tests marketed for diagnosis of CMPA include atopy patch tests and food prints; however, scientific evidence and consensus on their specificity, application, and interpretation is currently limited and they are therefore not recommended. Consensus recommendations [Table 2](#T2)). CMPA should be suspected if: TREATMENT OF COW'S MILK PROTEIN ALLERGY [8](#B8), [45](#B45)]; this criterion is met by some eHF and by AAF. Both eHF and AAF have proven efficacy in treating CMPA, with studies demonstrating their ability to reduce CMPA symptoms in confirmed or suspected cases [ [46](#B46)]. An eHF should be considered as the first choice in all but the most severe cases of CMPA, predominantly due to the fact it is cheaper than AAF milk [ [47](#B47)] and has been shown to be better at inducing tolerance [ [28](#B28)]. The use of AAF is warranted in severe cases such as anaphylaxis and also in infants who do not tolerate eHF [ [46](#B46), [48](#B48)]. [49](#B49)]. While mare, donkey and camel milk appear to be better tolerated, there is still a risk of cross-reactivity [ [49](#B49), [50](#B50)]. Furthermore, these mammalian milks are not nutritionally adapted to the needs of the infant. [8](#B8)] and they have been shown to induce fewer allergies than cow's milk-based formulae [ [51](#B51), [52](#B52)]. Soy formula is well tolerated by most individuals with CMPA, with 10-14% of infants with CMPA shown to be sensitized to soy and reports of anaphylaxis very rare [ [53](#B53)]. There have been concerns raised about the isoflavone (phytoestrogen) content of soy formulae and its potential adverse effect on sexual development and reproduction; however, a recent meta-analysis has shown that the patterns of growth, bone health, and metabolic, reproductive, endocrine, immune, and neurologic functions seen in infants fed soy-based formulae are similar to those observed in children fed CMF or human milk [ [54](#B54)]. [27](#B27)]. Most guidelines recommend against the use of soy before the age of 6 months [ [7](#B7), [52](#B52), [55](#B55)] on the basis that adverse reactions to soy are more common in infants under 6 months [ [53](#B53)]. It is the expert opinion of this panel that this recommendation is not strong as it is made on the basis of one study in which the group aged less than 6 months that was fed soy formula contained only 20 infants. [27](#B27), [56](#B56), [57](#B57)]. However, rice formulae have not been extensively studied to establish their 90% efficacy and there are also concerns about the levels of arsenic that may be present [ [58](#B58)]. At this point there are no firm recommendations on rice-based formulae. [7](#B7)]. It is important that the following points are strictly observed for an oral challenge: There should be medical supervision present There should be effective treatment calculated and available prior to the challenge for patients who may experience severe anaphylaxis Patients should be observed for at least 2 hours following the maximum dose (if there are any clinical reactions, then medical supervision should be continued as appropriate) Infants should not be tested on a full stomach or after an overnight fast (2-3 hours after their last meal is advisable) Intravenous access is necessary if a severe or systemic reaction is likely [59](#B59)]. The prognosis of CMPA is good, with resolution of symptoms in 45-50% of infants by 1 year, 60-75% by 2 years, 85-90% by 3 years, and persistence in only 10% of infants [ [6](#B6)]. High IgE levels correlate with persistence of allergy, and are therefore a useful predictor of patient outcome [ [60](#B60)]. Consensus recommendations [Fig. 2](#F2). CONCLUSION [53](#B53), [54](#B54)]. The second is the consideration that affordability of formulae is recognized by the panel of experts as a key challenge in the region, and therefore there is a need for an alternative recommendation that reflects this challenge.
