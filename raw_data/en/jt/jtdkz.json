Gustatory, medically, refers to the sense of taste. The sense of taste helps identify food and forms a taste preference, although the appeal of both sweet- and salty-tasting substances, in large part at least, is innately determined (Beauchamp and Cowart, 1985). Gustatory behaviors, such as neophobia and taste aversion learning, suggest that the gustatory information from the taste buds is compared to gustatory memories at all times during food intake, and thus we avoid ingesting novel or harmful food. Gustatory memories enable us to generate vivid perceptions of taste in the absence of peripheral gustatory inputs. Thus, not only signals from the peripheral gustatory nervous system but also those obtained by recalling gustatory memories play a critical role for gustatory information processing. Designed on one hand to examine food preferences, delicacies and taboos tied to some of the world's most unusual sources of sustenance, the course is also crafted to connect the simple acts of eating, no matter how unusual the product or preparation, with the supper table's intricate links to culture, identity, politics and economics.
