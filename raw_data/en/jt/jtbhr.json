LIN* ABSTRACT Environmental toxic tort cases often pose difficult problems of proof. A substance's toxicity may be unk nown or uncertain. A combination of factors may cause a plaintiff's injury, and the injury may arise many years after a plaintiff's exposure to a toxic substance. On the one hand, some plaintiffs, particularly those with \"signature\" illnesses or whose illnesses occur as a cluster of cases, may be able to gather sufficient evidence to support a tort action. On the other hand, it is likely that many environmental injury victims simply fail to recognize their illnesses as tortious injuries and never receive compensation. Cancer and various respiratory ailments, for instance, can result from exposure to commonly found and commonly released pollutants. Because of the difficulty of identifying potential defendants and proving causation, such cases simply fall outside of the tort system. This leaves social costs externalized and victims uncompensated. In response to this problem, this Article proposes a risk-based administrative system of liability and compensation for exposure to environmental pollutants. At the time pollutants are released, major pollution emitters would pay levies. The levies would be based on the * Acting Professor of Law, U.C.

This compensation-for-risk approach avoids troublesome case-by-case determinations of specific causation.

Power plants are not the only source of toxic chemical emissions. Daily, hundreds of chemical substances enter our bodies through the air we breathe, the water we drink, the food we eat, and the things we touch. Although some of these substances are benign, others are harmful, and the vast majority have unknown and uncertain effects on human health and the environment. 2 The difficulties of proving causation in such cases confound environmental tort plaintiffs. Assuming that victims are even aware that they have been injured, victims must overcome gaps in knowledge regarding causation, risk, and harm to obtain compensation for their injuries. The characteristics of environmental toxic injuries 3 complicate efficient liability determinations. These injuries tend to involve a large number of persons exposed to significant, albeit low, probability risks. A long latency period between exposure and illness and multiple alternate 1. C ONRAD G.

In this Article, \"environmental toxic injuries\" refers to harms caused by substances in the general environment, as opposed to harms caused by use of a particular product. Cf. Troyen A. Brennan, Environmental Torts , 46 V AND. L. REV. 1, 2 (1993) (distinguishing personal injuries caused by toxic substances in the environment from traditional trespass, nuisance, and product liability claims). 1442 SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA LAW REVIEW [Vol. 78:1439 causes of illness exacerbate this causation problem.4 These difficulties, combined with the costs of liti gation, result in the systematic undercompensation of environmental tort victims and the systematic underdeterrence of polluters.5 One promise of the digital age, however, is a dramatically enhanced ability to track environmental pollution at reasonable cost.6 In the near future, it may be possible to track a pollutant from its point of release into the environment to the recepto r that ultimately absorbs it.7 The technologies that could enable such a system include minuscule wireless sensors that can monitor microenvironments and sophisticated computer models that track the movement of pollutants. 8 In addition, developments in toxicogenomics, the study of the effects of exposure to a toxic substance on genes, 9 will augment our ability to analyze the effects of chemical substances on human health. These technological advances may revolutionize the protection of human health and the environment by elucidating otherwise unknown causal relationships between pollutants and human illness. As a result, society may be able to compensate environmental tort victims appropriately and internalize presently overlooked externalities. Such technological advances will lower barriers to cost internalization\u2014whether by tort, administrative, or contractual means. 10 Imagine, for example, a situation in which members of a community can estimate their expected exposure to pollutants emitted by a new factory, as well as the incremental risk of environmental illness. Armed with this information, community members may be able to negotiate compensation for their increased risk of injury as a condition of the factory's operation. 11 Such contractual exchanges offer the potential to internalize upfront the costs to the community, but they are suitable for 4.

Transaction costs are likely to be high, with each individual's expected harm likely to be small. Individuals will have only a limited desire to expend resources to negotiate compensation agreements with all polluters that may affect them. 12 Like contractual approaches, tort approaches would offer only limited relief to the environmentally injured in our hypothetical scenario. Given the ex post nature of tort liability, victims will still face the risk that a polluter will become insolvent. Moreover, notwithstanding an enhanced capability to track pollution, many potential plaintiffs will face insurmountable obstacles in proving causation. Where multiple risk factors for environmental illness are present, science will often be unable to demonstrate that exposure to a particular defendant's pollutants was the \"but for\" cause of the illness. 13 Even plaintiffs armed with detailed information about the source of the pollutants to which they were exposed may be unable to meet their burdens of establishing causation due to evidentiary requirements and scientific limitations. 14 In addition, the costs of litigating against all possible defendants and the respective burdens on the judicial system make the prospect of tort compensation unattractive, if not unworkable. This Article proposes a risk-based administrative system of liability and compensation for exposure to environmental pollutants as an alternative and a complement to the tort system. Under this proposal, major sources of pollution would pay levies ex ante. These levies would be based on the amount of pollutants released, the likely exposure of persons to those pollutants, the risk of harm from that exposure, and the expected costs of that harm to the victims. Compensation would be based on the health risk borne by each individual as a result of that individual's exposure. This proposal differs fundamentally from earlier proposals for administrative compensation in that it uses a risk-based approach to capitalize on technological advances in gathering health and environmental information. These advances will promote an understanding of the causal 12. See DON N. DEWEES , DAVID DUFF & MICHAEL TREBILCOCK , EXPLORING THE DOMAIN OF ACCIDENT LAW: TAKING THE FACTS SERIOUSLY 266 (1996) (observing that negotiations will not take place in most cases of pollution emissions because of the presence of multiple victims, multiple sources, and great uncertainty); Esty, supra note 4, at 180-81; Louis Kaplow & Steven Shavell, Property Rules Versus Liability Rules: An Economic Analysis , 109 H ARV.

See id . 1444 SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA LAW REVIEW [Vol. 78:1439 relationships between toxic exposure and harm, and provide increasingly accurate estimates of the extent and the cost of environmental harms. Based on these advances, polluters can be forced to internalize the costs of toxic risks and to provide upfront compensation to victims. This ex ante approach facilitates preventative and mitigating measures while avoiding difficult case-by-case determinations of specific causation. Although this proposed system is not yet feasible as a comprehensive approach, technological advances in our ability to track, measure, and \"price\" environmental toxic harms will make this system an increasingly attractive complement to existing legal doctrines. Part I of this Article describes the problems of proof presently faced by environmental tort plaintiffs. This discussion focuses on the difficulties of proving causation and the overall inadequacy of the tort system in addressing environmental toxic injuries. Part II presents the policy rationale for a new administrative system. This discussion first compares the current regulatory, tort, and administrative approaches to the problem. This part then discusses various technological advances that make an administrative system both possible and attractive. Part III reviews earlier administrative proposals for addressing environmental toxic injury and delineates the proposed risk-based system. Part IV explores the practical feasibility of this proposal by examining previously implemented administrative schemes and by illustrating how this proposal builds upon them. These previous schemes include a rudimentary pollution-compensation scheme adopted in Japan in the 1970s, New Zealand's no-fault compensation system for accidental injury, and the workers' compensation system in the United States. Part V considers possible objections to the proposal, including whether merely modifying the tort system might be preferable. In Part VI, this Article concludes that an administrative system is better suited than the tort system to capitalize on the advances of the digital age in order to achieve deterrence and compensation goals. I. THE PROBLEM WITH TORT The judicial system has struggled to address mass toxic torts in a fair, efficient, and inexpensive manner, as, for example, the Agent Orange and asbestos cases demonstrate. 15 Judicial management is complicated by the 15. See Robert L. Rabin, Some Thoughts on the Efficacy of a Mass Toxics Administrative Compensation Scheme , 52 M D. L. REV. 951, 952-54 (1993) [hereinafter Rabin, Some Thoughts ]. The traditional tort process is not well-suited to handle scientific determinations of causation involving latent and sometimes intangible harms. Such difficulties are only compounded when cases arise en 2005] BEYOND TORT 1445 large number of cases that arise and the individual factual variations among them. Yet even these examples understate the problem. Agent Orange and asbestos plaintiffs are generally able to point to a particular exposure to an identifiable substance as the possible cause of their illnesses. In contrast, persons injured by environmental pollution often have difficulty identifying a causal agent to link their injuries to an identifiable defendant. A. CHARACTERISTICS OF ENVIRONMENTAL TORTS The paradigmatic traditional tort case involves a single identifiable plaintiff, a single identifiable defendant, and a readily determinable cause of the tortious event. 16 For example, a pedestrian struck by a car can identify the driver of the car and the driver's negligence as the cause of the pedestrian's resulting injuries. Although the parties may dispute the driver's negligence or the harm suffered by the plaintiff, the judicial process is well equipped to determine such issues. Our judicial system is similarly able to handle classic strict liability claims, such as a dynamite explosion, a sudden flood from a reservoir, or even a catastrophic Bhopal-type accident. 17 In such cases, cause and effect are readily identifiable.18 An environmental tort plaintiff, however, often faces far more formidable problems of proof. As an initial matter, courts generally apply a negligence standard rather than a strict liability standard to ordinary economic activities. 19 Only where a polluter is engaged in abnormally dangerous activities do courts apply a strict liability standard.20 Furthermore, environmental tort plaintiffs must overcome the high hurdles of causation and latency of harm.21 masse .

Latency of Harm Latency of harm complicates proving causation with any environmental disease that takes time to develop. For example, consider an individual who is diagnosed with cancer many years after an exposure to carcinogenic pollutants released from an industrial facility. Over the course of a lifetime, this individual has been exposed to numerous carcinogens through various pathways, including air, water, and food supply. In contrast to the paradigmatic tort plaintiff described above, this plaintiff's injury is latent, appearing some time after exposure. 22 The length of the latency period may vary among individuals. Thus, even when a population is exposed simultaneously to a pollutant, incidences of disease occur over a period of time that can span several decades. 23 This latency and lack of simultaneity make evidence more difficult to gather. For example, victims may not have been aware of their first exposure to a toxic substance. Therefore, years later, they will likely be unable to prove the fact, timing, or extent of exposure. 24 Exposure often occurs at low levels over extended periods of time. The passage of time not only complicates proof, but also increases the risk that a defendant will no longer be financially viable, assuming that the defendant can even be identified. 25 Compounding plaintiffs' difficulties, statutes of limitations may bar suit, although some jurisdictions have rules tolling the statutory period until the time when the injury is discovered. 26 2. Causation An even greater barrier faced by plaintiffs is causation.27 Toxic tort plaintiffs typically must establish two types of causation. First, a plaintiff must prove general causation\u2014that a substance is capable of causing the Historically, liability law dealt with diffuse hazards through nuisance doctrine, which required proof of serious, continuing, and unreasonable disturbance.

Second, a plaintiff must prove specific causation\u2014that exposure to the substance in fact caused that plaintiff's injury.28 The scientific uncertainty that surrounds causation can make these burdens insurmountable.29 A few diseases, such as asbestosis, are so-called \"signature diseases\"\u2014diseases that are extremely rare in the general population, but far more prevalent in persons exposed to a particular substance. 30 These illnesses can be traced to exposure to a specific substance. Illnesses involving environmental toxic exposure, however, often can result from multiple causes. 31 For example, an individual instance of lung cancer might be attributed to exposure to tobacco smoke, exposure to pollutants from a nearby factory, or exposure to pollutants from traffic on a local highway.32 Separating the roles of the potential causal agents, which may interact in complex ways, is often problematic, if not impossible.33 Unlike our automobile accident example, there is usually no obvious evidence that a particular agent caused the plaintiff's harm in environmental tort cases. 34 a. General Causation Much of the difficulty with environmental tort litigation is due to an insufficient scientific understanding of general causation. Essentially, the question is whether a certain chemical has the ability to cause a particular illness and, if so, to what extent. Reliable information regarding carcinogenic and other health effects is available for relatively few 28. See Daniel A. Farber, Toxic Causation , 71 M INN. L. REV. 1219, 1227-28 (1987). 29. See E.

Because acutely dangerous environmental contaminants are often directly regulated, such diseases are relatively uncommon. See Peter S.

For many substances, health effects are unknown.35 Molecular assays and animal bioassays provide some information on mutagenicity or carcinogenicity. 36 Scientists, however, caution that this information cannot always be extrapolated in a reliable manner to estimate human cancer risks.37 Courts tend to view epidemiological studies, which apply statistical techniques to explain variations in disease rates of human populations, as the most persuasive and acceptable type of general causation evidence in toxic tort cases.38 Yet the very use of such studies creates difficulties. Epidemiological studies establish associations between alleged causes and effects by comparing either the incidence of disease across exposed and unexposed populations or exposure levels across sick and healthy 35. See supra note 2. See also Dewees, supra note 24, at 195 (noting a 1990 EPA report, which stated that only ten percent of two hundred known atmospheric pollutants had been tested for mutagenicity or carcinogenicity). As one scholar has noted: There are thousands of regulated substances that rarely, if ever, could be the subject of a successful tort action. The available evidence is sufficient to support a finding that they probably cause nontrivial injuries of some types, but it is insufficient to support a finding that they probably caused any particular injury. Richard J. Pierce, Jr., Causation in Government Regulation and Toxic Torts , 76 W ASH. U. L.Q. 1307, 1308 (1998). There is even disagreement regarding the risk posed by low-level exposure to asbestos, which has been the subject of numerous epidemiological studies. Dewees, supra note 24, at 196. 36. Given ethical constraints on human health experiments, scientists primarily rely on indirect methods to test for toxicity or carcinogenicity, such as using molecular assays, animal bioassays, and epidemiological studies. See Menell, supra note 30, at 95. The Ames test, for instance, crudely screens substances for carcinogenicity based on the number of mutations occurring in bacteria exposed to each substance.

This reluctance has been criticized as grounded in a misunderstanding of the nature of scientific inquiry.

Such studies may be unable to detect small increases in risk; these studies can lack sufficient follow-up times to discover diseases with long latency periods, and they may fail to account for as-of-yet unknown factors that affect disease rates. 41 Detailed epidemiological data is available only for relatively few toxic substances. Furthermore, where such data is available, there may be uncertainty regarding the magnitude of the risk involved. 42 b. Specific Causation Specific causation is also frequently uncertain with environmental toxic injuries. Epidemiological studies may establish that a substance can cause the type of harm suffered by a plaintiff, satisfying general causation. But a plaintiff must still demonstrate that the particular harm was in fact the result of exposure to a given substance. Epidemiological studies, however, can only attribute a proportion of the incidence of disease in a population to any particular source. They are not designed to prove specific causation. 43 Specific causation requires a plaintiff to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the defendant caused that particular plaintiff's harm. Many courts interpret the preponderance standard to require a relative risk ratio of 2.0 or greater 44\u2014for example, a defendant's conduct more than doubled the plaintiff's risk of injury.45 This doubled-risk requirement, however, 39.

Gold, supra note 34, at 380-86. For instance, epidemiological evidence may demonstrate that a substance causes a thirty-percent increase in cancer rates, with the scientific community being ninety- nine percent certain of this causal relationship. Relying on this evidence, a hypothetical plaintiff would never be able to recover under the doubled-risk requirement because the majority of cancer cases were not caused by the substance. Unless traditional tort requirements are relaxed (for example, through the adoption of proportional liability, see infra Section V.B.2), the defendant would never be held accountable for a thirty-percent increase in cancer rates. Even plaintiffs who were able to identify the cause of their injuries would remain uncompensated. See id . Cf. Mark Geistfeld, Scientific Uncertainty and Causation in Tort Law , 54 V AND. L.

Plaintiffs sometimes introduce expert testimony based on differential diagnosis to establish specific causation\u2014a physician rules out other possible causes of the injury based on the case history and clinical evidence. Courts are divided on the acceptability of this approach. See Gary E. Marchant, Genomics and Toxic Substances: Part L. REP. 10,071, 10,077-78 & nn.76-77 (2003). One commentator has proposed the combined use of differential diagnosis and epidemiological studies. This combination could ameliorate judicial reservations about the probative value of studies alone, if those studies indicated relative risk ratios between 1.0 and 2.0.

Veysey, 334 F.3d 600, 604- 06 (7th Cir. 2003) (discussing Smith and the evidentiary value of probabilistic evidence). The refusal to accept probabilistic evidence as sufficient to establish causation reflects a simplistic approach to causation more consistent with eighteenth century Newtonian science than with modern scientific inquiry.

REV. infra Section I.A.2.c. 2005] BEYOND TORT 1451 it is insufficient even to prove that exposure to a substance more than doubled a plaintiff's risk of injury.49 In addition, if a particular disease- causing substance was generated by more than one source, a plaintiff may also have to demonstrate which of multiple potential defendants produced the substance responsible for the injury.50 But if a plaintiff is able to identify two or more tortfeasors who collectively released sufficient pollutants to cause the harm, courts may be willing to attach liability to each one. Courts may treat each as a causal agent under a \"substantial factor\" test, under a theory of joint and several liability, or under a theory of market share liability. 51 Resolution of all of these issues requires costly expert testimony. Here, environmental tort plaintiffs face another hurdle\u2014the fairly rigorous standard for expert testimony mandated by Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals . 52 In Daubert , the Supreme Court interpreted the Federal Rules of Evidence to require that the trial judge serve as a gatekeeper for scientific testimony. The Court identified several factors for trial courts to consider in determining the admissibility of scientific testimony. 53 The Daubert standard has proven to be too strict for many toxic tort plaintiffs to meet\u2014courts often find the proposed experts' testimony to be too unreliable to be admissible in light of scientific uncertainty and incomplete scientific knowledge.54 49.

Scientific Causation Versus Legal Causation Ultimately, the judicial struggle with causation reflects the inherent tension between traditional causal analysis and modern science's probabilistic understanding of causation. 55 The traditional view characterizes causation in terms of collisions following the laws of Newtonian physics where discrete, identifiable actors injure a readily identified victim. 56 This view of causation emphasizes individual responsibility and corrective justice, but does so by looking backwards at specific prior events. In contrast, scientific causation is forward looking\u2014it studies the past in order to predict future events. Scientific causation depends on analyzing likelihood and collective effects to generate probabilistic evidence. 57 Traditional causation and modern scientific causation come into conflict in environmental toxic tort cases\u2014a conflict that is likely to be exacerbated as technology advances. B. TORT OBJECTIVES UNDERMINED The difficulties of overcoming latency and proving causation undermine the tort system's ability to meet its principal objectives.

Here, the tort system essentially serves as social insurance by spreading the costs of accidents to risk creators and their consumers. 59 Deterrence is achieved through the threat of financial liability\u2014economically rational actors are forced to take into account the impacts of their activities on others. Proponents of efficient deterrence argue that liability rules should be designed to induce efficient levels of activity and care. 60 Proponents of corrective justice contend that those responsible for violating other persons' autonomy should restore those persons to their preinjury status.61 In environmental toxic tort cases, the tort system fails to serve any of these objectives well.62 1. Undercompensation Given the difficulties discussed above, environmental tort plaintiffs often face very limited prospects for obtaining compensation. In contrast to highly publicized toxic tort cases such as those involving Love Canal 63 or 58. See GUIDO CALABRESI , THE COSTS OF ACCIDENTS : A LEGAL AND ECONOMIC ANALYSIS 24- 33 (1970) (describing the principal goals of accident law as justice and the reduction of accident costs, the latter of which includes subgoals of deterring accidents, reducing administrative costs, and reducing societal costs, typically through compensation); D EWEES ET AL ., supra note 12, at 5-9 (identifying these three objectives as the major normative perspectives of tort law); S TEPHEN D.

Victims tend to suffer cancer, heart disease, respiratory illness, and other maladies 65 not readily traced to potential defendants.66 Although the exact number of uncompensated deaths and illnesses is uncertain, studies indicate this number is substantial.67 For instance, in 2002, one study concluded that the inhabitants of heavily polluted metropolitan areas in the United States face a twelve- percent higher risk of lung cancer than inhabitants of the least polluted areas.68 This increase is attributed to long-term exposure to fine particulate air pollution from coal-fired power plants, factories, and diesel trucks.69 Another study, also completed in 2002, estimated that sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide emissions from eight electric utility systems in the midwestern United States and the southern United States cause 5900 premature deaths from lung cancer and other respiratory illnesses, 4300 cases of chronic bronchitis, and 140,000 asthma attacks per year. 70 The Environmental Protection Agency (\"EPA\") estimates that exposure to toxic 64.

Like all tort plaintiffs, those few environmental tort victims who can demonstrate liability receive only partial compensation once attorneys' fees are paid. According to a recent estimate, of each dollar spent in insured tort cases, twenty-two cents compensates for economic loss, twenty-four cents compensates for noneconomic loss, and the remaining fifty-four cents goes to attorneys and administrative costs. 75 These figures are consistent with previous studies that have found that tort plaintiffs recover less than half of the total amount expended by defendants and their insurers.76 The 71.

HEALTH L. & 1456 SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA LAW REVIEW [Vol. 78:1439 difficulties of proving causation make it likely that the share of proceeds going toward compensation is even lower in environmental toxic injury cases.77 The chance of a plaintiff's successful recovery is further eroded by the legal remoteness of damages, the difficulty of valuing subjective losses, and the difficulty of accounting for the increased risk of latent harms. 78 Damages are often paid years after a victim has been injured; thus, the recovery may be of little use to the victim. Often, only the victim's survivors receive the benefit of any recovery. Furthermore, the tort system's general lack of oversight and coordination adds to the inequities\u2014dissimilar awards are common for similarly situated victims. 79 Finally, if a defendant becomes insolvent, remaining plaintiffs will be unable to secure compensation. 80 Undercompensation thus appears to be the norm. One might argue, however, that an individual plaintiff who does manage to demonstrate liability is overcompensated. Courts award full compensation whenever the \"more probable than not\" standard is met, despite a significant probability that there were other causal factors involved. Therefore, a plaintiff may be overcompensated to the extent that damages are recovered for these other factors. 81 Overcompensation may also occur in a case in which a court has POL'Y 287, 298 (1998) (estimating that between sixty cents and seventy-two cents of every dollar in medical malpractice cases is spent on administrative costs). 77.

Underdeterrence Like compensation, deterrence is a basic objective of the tort system that fails in environmental toxic injury cases.85 In theory, a tort system could be designed to achieve efficient deterrence by internalizing all of the social costs of each tortfeasor's activities.86 Environmental toxic torts REV. 789, 810 (1996).

But Dewees noted the relatively limited amount of such litigation compared to the annual estimate of over 10,000 environmentally-caused cases of cancer. Dewees concluded that barriers to lawsuits must result in systematic underdeterrence.

See also Brennan, supra note 3, at 6-7 (using similar evidence to conclude that \"environmental tort suits currently send a weak deterrent signal\"). 86. The discussion here assumes a perspective in which the negative health effects of pollution are treated as externalities generated by polluters' activities. See A.C. PIGOU , THE (4th ed. 1932); B RUCE YANDLE , COMMON SENSE AND COMMON LAW FOR THE ENVIRONMENT : CREATING WEALTH IN HUMMINGBIRD ECONOMIES 38-39 (1997). The natural extension of this perspective, the \"polluter pays principle,\" requires that the costs of these externalities be internalized to polluters to achieve efficiency and fairness. See M ICHAEL FAURE & G\u00d6RAN SKOGH , THE ECONOMIC ANALYSIS (2003); P IGOU , supra , at 192- 93. As Ronald Coase argued, however, pollution problems can also be conceptualized as conflicts among property rights in which, if transactions costs are assumed to be zero, socially efficient results may be reached through bargaining between polluters and those exposed to pollution. R.H. Coase, The Problem of Social Cost , 3 J.L. & ECON. 1 (1960). Nevertheless, the Coasean approach is of marginal applicability if transaction costs are high, which is likely to be the case where each pollution source 1458 SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA LAW REVIEW [Vol. 78:1439 involve one party's unilateral imposition of risk onto others. Usually, victims are unaware of the risk and unable to take steps to protect themselves. 87 Economic models indicate that in such situations, strict liability rules can be used to induce socially optimal behavior. In other words, efficient activity levels and efficient caretaking can be promoted.88 For efficient deterrence, an actor's expected liability must equal the total expected social costs of the activity. Thus, actors must have accurate information regarding their expected future tort liability.89 With respect to environmental toxic injuries, underdeterrence is virtually guaranteed. Assessing future liability is clouded by ignorance of the dangers, by the scope of exposure, and by the low probability that defendants will be held responsible for those dangers. 90 Most air and water pollution impose small costs on a large number of people. They are thus unlikely to warrant the costs of litigation for any individual victim.91 In addition, potential defendants are likely to discount the long-term negative effects of present imposes low-level but significant risks on large numbers of exposed individuals.

See D EWEES ET AL ., supra note 12, at 275. 2005] BEYOND TORT 1459 decisions because plaintiffs' injuries will not arise until far into the future.92 When injuries do arise, plaintiffs will face numerous problems of proving causation. 93 Corporations generally amortize such future costs by incorporating a discount rate into their calculations of future cash flow.94 If an injury does not occur until twenty or thirty years after exposure, the discounted value of the injury is likely to approach zero. 95 Moreover, organizations may be deterred only to the extent that decisionmakers in the organization bear responsibility for their decisions.96 This is unlikely to happen where injuries are latent. Internal corporate structures may not provide the proper incentives to corporate decisionmakers, who may not be with the corporation decades later when liability is imposed. 97 Liability insurance, where available,98 further reduces corporate decisionmakers' incentives to consider the full cost of negative externalities.99 This is especially so if insurance premiums fail to reflect the risks associated with a particular insured's activities.100 Not surprisingly, the limited empirical data available suggests that common law tort litigation has had little deterrent effect on polluter behavior. The exceptions are instances where a harm can be readily linked to a large and isolated pollution source.101 In theory, if a plaintiff has sufficient data to show that one of several defendants caused the plaintiff's 92.

Corrective Justice The third objective of the tort system is to provide corrective justice, which has been defined as \"the defendant's obligation to compensate for harm that she has caused wrongfully or in violation of the plaintiff's rights.\"103 With environmental toxic injuries, the tort system fails to provide corrective justice to victims for many of the same reasons that it fails to achieve compensation and deterrence. Here again, the causation inquiry is critical. Many commentators consider causation central to corrective justice because it establishes the essential nexus between the parties by identifying the specific victim of the injurer's acts. 104 Yet the obstacles to proving causation in environmental toxic tort cases often prevent any such nexus from being established. II. THE CASE FOR REPLACING TORT WITH ADMINISTRATIVE COMPENSATION Having examined the tort system's failure to address environmental toxic injuries in Part I, we must consider which new legal solutions might offer a better approach. A. INSTITUTIONAL OPTIONS Legal institutions can be described as information processing systems. Each system differs in how it processes information and in how strict a 102. Cf. Boston, supra note 81, at 589-90 (proposing apportionment of liability as a solution). 103. Kenneth W. Simons, Corrective Justice and Liability for Risk-Creation: A Comment , 38 UCLA L. REV. 113, 125-26 (1990). 104. See, e.g. , Weinrib, supra note 61, at 38 (\"The requirement of factual causation establishes the indispensable nexus between the parties by relating their rights to a transaction in which one has directly impinged upon the other.\"). Cf. George P. Fletcher, Fairness and Utility in Tort Theory , 85 HARV. L. REV. 537, 542 (1972) (contending that tort liability rests on injuries to a victim caused by a tortfeasor's imposition of nonreciprocal risks); Christopher H. Schroeder, Corrective Justice and Liability for Increasing Risks , 37 UCLA L. REV. 439, 465-66 (1990) (arguing that corrective justice merely requires demonstrating that the defendant caused an increased risk of harm, rather than demonstrating the causing of actual harm). 2005] BEYOND TORT 1461 standard of causation it requires.105 For example, legislation sets ambient air quality standards based on only minimal information linking the problem (harm to public health and the environment) to its source (pollution). 106 In contrast, tort litigation requires very specific information causally linking a particular plaintiff's injuries to the conduct of a particular defendant. 107 Administrative compensation systems occupy an intermediate position in this spectrum. Such systems require moderate amounts of information because they address classes of activities or injuries without necessarily matching particular injuries to particular actions. 108 Legal institutions also vary in terms of whether they function ex ante or ex post. Safety regulations and corrective taxes are ex ante mechanisms that apply before, and independent of, the occurrence of an injury. In contrast, tort liability and most monetary penalties are triggered ex post by the occurrence of the harm. 109 Administrative systems may function in either manner. Ex ante approaches tend to be advantageous in situations where linking harms to injurers is difficult or where injurers may escape responsibility because of financial insolvency. 110 These are the very problems that characterize environmental toxic injuries. Ex post approaches, however, generally involve lower administrative costs since the costs are borne only if harm occurs. 111 Ex post approaches can be advantageous where the injurer has better information about risks than the government may have. In such cases, the injurer is in a better position to decide how to reduce risks. 112 This informational advantage, however, does not exist with respect to many health-related and environmental risks. In these cases, injurers have little incentive to generate or obtain such risk- related information. 113 For these risks, ex ante government regulation may be more appropriate.114 105. E.

The EPA then compiles the data in a publicly available database, the Toxics Release Inventory.118 Proposition 65 requires businesses to provide a \"clear and reasonable\" warning prior to exposing any individual to a listed carcinogen or toxicant.119 By employing public pressure and facilitating bargaining, such information disclosure programs encourage the reduction of pollution to levels below those mandated by other forms of regulation. 120 But on their own, disclosure programs neither internalize costs nor provide compensation. Unfortunately, the information disclosed can sometimes be uninformative, irrelevant, confusing, or overwhelming. 121 The United States has addressed the problem of pollution-based injury with two divergent institutional mechanisms: tort liability and command-and-control regulation. At one end, if sufficient causal information exists to attribute individual liability, the tort system regulates ex post the release of substances that result in injury. At the other end, command-and-control regulation prohibits ex ante the release of certain substances that are known or believed to be injurious. Command-and-control regulation may also restrict pollution levels for other substances to thresholds intended to protect human health and the environment. 122 For example, under the Clean Air Act,123 the EPA has promulgated national ambient air quality standards for six \"criteria\" pollutants.124 These 115.

For the purposes of regulation, the EPA has instead merely designated certain levels of risk from exposure to carcinogens as \"acceptable.\" 132 Toxicological and epidemiological research, however, increasingly suggests that many substances cause significant but low level risks at very low concentrations. This may be true even for noncarcinogenic substances. 133 In some instances, stricter regulation or outright prohibition 124.

Ultimately, command-and-control regulation reflects policy choices made after a consideration of the costs and benefits. The weakness of such regulations, however, is that they generally do not internalize health costs, but allow them to fall where they may. 136 An administrative compensation system could fill this gap by forcing pollution sources to internalize the social costs of pollution without banning the pollution absolutely. B. ADVANTAGES OF AN ADMINISTRATIVE SYSTEM In theory, the tort system could serve deterrence, compensation, and corrective justice goals even in the context of environmental injury.

From an institutional analysis perspective, administrative systems have certain characteristics that make them a superior alternative for addressing the environmental toxic injury problem.138 Administrative systems typically employ specialized or expert decisionmakers who can conduct their own studies and consider a broad range of information. 139 Administrative systems can also provide more continuous oversight and distribute compensation more fairly among a class of victims.140 In addition, administrative systems are, in theory, more politically accountable than the judicial system.141 This is not to suggest that setting compensation should be politicized; rather, the scientific uncertainty inherent in environmental toxic injuries necessitates making policy decisions. 142 In an 137.

Administrative systems also offer flexibility in the processes used to manage cases. For example, agencies can employ ex post adversarial processes to decide cases on an individual basis. Or agencies can assign costs and benefits ex ante to groups of similarly situated parties based on risk assessments. Individualized, quasi-judicial proceedings offer the advantage of precisely tailored outcomes, which may be beneficial when dealing with intangible losses such as pain and suffering. 143 But greater efficiency may be gained by using a standardized schedule of damages to make determinations without any adversarial proceeding.144 These characteristics should enable a well-designed administrative compensation system to achieve deterrence and redress more effectively than the current tort system does. Attaining a desired level of deterrence is simpler through an administrative system than through a decentralized tort system. If sufficient scientific data were available, the system could be calibrated through taxation or a similar mechanism to hold risk-creators responsible for the harm they cause. 145 Such taxes force a polluter to consider ex ante the likely costs of an activity when deciding whether to adopt precautionary measures. Moreover, a polluter will consider these costs when deciding whether to engage in the activity at all. 146 Indeed, by taking a broader and more systematic perspective, agencies can consider rejected the tort law approach of paying people after-the-fact in favor of a policy of prevention, in a world of bounded rationality, scientific uncertainties must be weighed along with all of the other elements considered valid in a 'messy' real world.\"). 143.

Christopher Schroeder has argued that a system that imposes liability based on risk of harm rather than on actual harm would be more consistent with corrective justice principles than the current tort system is. That is because the moral quality of a defendant's behavior would be judged according to the information available to the defendant at the moment of decision. Schroeder, supra note 104, at 451-68. This understanding of corrective justice might also support compensation based on risk of harm, rather than on actual harm. See Simons, supra note 103, at 128-29.

First, public agencies may require greater oversight, as they are more vulnerable than the judiciary to capture by regulated parties\u2014an agency may become more responsive to particular special interests than it is to th e legislative or executive branch. 162 Second, the tort system has the advantage of hindsight. Ex ante regulation requires information at the outset\u2014risks of injury and the costs and benefits of particular standards must be known beforehand.163 In contrast, the tort system focuses on a specific claim that arises after an injury occurs. Given the scope of uncertainty regarding the effects of exposure to many chemical substances, any administrative or regulatory ex ante scheme is likely to be considerably incomplete in the foreseeable future. The tort system will continue to act as a critical safety net even as environmental information gaps are narrowed.164 159. Christopher H.

TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCES MAKING AN ADMINISTRATIVE SYSTEM POSSIBLE The theoretical advantages of an administrative compensation system are irrelevant if the information necessary to support such a system is unavailable. This section surveys recent technological advances in potentially relevant fields. This survey demonstrates that scientific groundwork is now being laid that may eventually enable the implementation of an ex ante risk-based administrative system of liability. 1. General Causation Scientists are now developing increasingly sophisticated techniques for studying biomarkers (indicators of chemical substance, events or conditions in the human body). They are also making advances in toxicogenomics and in other technological fields described below. By capitalizing on these advances, scientists will soon be able to more rapidly screen chemical substances for toxicity and to more effectively study the causal relationships between exposure and illness. 165 Assessing causation begins with analyzing one's exposure to environmental chemicals. Historically, scientists have estimated exposure by collecting information on the attributes of exposure (such as magnitude, duration, frequency, and timing) through questionnaires, interviews, and centralized monitoring. 166 The inexactness of these methods introduces substantial uncertainty into the resulting estimates of exposure.167 Direct measurement of an individual's environment, such as with a portable monitor, can provide a more accurate record of chemical contact. Such methods are costlier, however, and fail to measure actual chemical uptake, a weakness these methods share with the less direct methods of estimating exposure. 168 a. Biomonitoring Biomonitoring techniques allow for far more accurate assessments of exposure because scientists can look for biomarkers directly in the human 165. See generally Jamie A.

The CDC reported its exposure data for 148 chemicals in 2005. 176 Over 250 compounds are now testable by biomonitoring, including metals, 169. S AMUEL H. WILSON & WILLIAM A.

By measuring actual chemical levels in tissue, scientists who conduct biomonitoring can account for interspecies differences in metabolism and excretion rates. 182 b. Toxicogenomics The emerging field of toxicogenomics relies on a particular type of biomarker\u2014genetic biomarkers. These genetic markers are used to analyze the causal relationships between toxic exposure and disease. Toxicogenomics studies the relationship between the structure and activity of the genome and the adverse biological effects of chemical substances. 183 The central principle underlying toxicogenomics is that exposure to a toxic 177.

First, toxicogenomics can screen substances for potential toxicity more quickly, cheaply, and accurately than can animal testing.189 Second, for substances already known to be toxic, toxicogenomics will enable a more qualitative and quantitative assessment of the risks posed by exposure.190 Third, toxicogenomics can help to identify persons who have been impacted by environmental factors.191 Nevertheless, a causal relationship between exposure and disease is not sufficiently established by either the use of biomonitoring to identify a 184.

For some environmental chemicals, such as lead, studies already provide an understanding of the risks associated with different chemical levels in the blood. 193 For other substances, however, further research is necessary.194 Although increasingly sophisticated biomonitoring techniques and toxicogenomics possess tremendous promise, our knowledge is currently incomplete\u2014we must study how changes in gene expression relate to disease. 195 c.

For instance, nanotechnology could be used to develop biosensors for detecting and analyzing biomarkers in blood or saliva. 196 Also, geographical information systems technology (\"GIS\") will increase the ability of epidemiologists to study the relationships between exposure and disease. Using GIS, researchers can quickly and inexpensively integrate large quantities of geographic and nongeographic data to test hypotheses for the causes of disease. 197 2. Specific Causation Proof of specific causation in toxic tort cases typically requires both proof that a pathway of exposure exists from the pollution source to the injured person and proof that the exposure caused a particular effect.198 An administrative compensation system, however, generally demands less 192.

Nevertheless, even estimates of exposure require a reasonable understanding of both the pathways of exposure and the effects of exposure. Today, that understanding can be refined by a variety of methods and technologies\u2014including portable personal monitors, biomarkers, data extrapolation from monitoring networks, mathematical models, or any combination of the above. 199 a. Measuring, Monitoring, and Attributing Exposure Individual exposure to pollutants may be estimated directly, through personal monitoring or biomonitoring, or indirectly, by combining data on pollutant concentrations at fixed locations with data on personal activity patterns. 200 To measure exposure directly, researchers can use lightweight and portable personal monitors that can measure exposure to common pollutants such as carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides, ozone, benzene, formaldehyde, and particulates.201 But measurement costs using individualized monitors tend to be relatively high.202 Indirect methods of estimating exposure are usually less expensive. Perhaps the simplest method is categorical classification. With this method, researchers use data on residence, occupation, and the like to develop crude estimates of exposure. 203 Such estimates, however, are generally considered inadequate for epidemiological purposes.204 For more precise estimates, researchers must use other techniques and devices to perform monitoring and modeling. 199.

Environmental Monitoring The EPA's Ambient Air Monitoring Program, for instance, collects air samples through a network of approximately 4000 monitoring stations distributed nationwide. 205 Samples collected by the network are typically analyzed for the six criteria pollutants designated by the EPA, but the network can be adapted to monitor for other pollutants, as well.206 The government or private parties often monitor a broader range of contaminants at individual sites to address local public health concerns. For example, an oil refinery in Rodeo, California, installed a real-time fence-line air-monitoring system after community concerns were raised over the release of toxic emissions. 207 The system operates twenty-four hours a day and can detect thirty-eight different chemicals.208 In other studies, researchers have installed similar remote sensors along streets and highway ramps to measure air emissions from passing cars.209 Advances in wireless sensor technology will soon enable pollution monitoring with even greater reso lution.

ASPEN characterizes the magnitude, extent, and significance of outdoor airborne concentrations for 148 hazardous airborne pollutants in each United States census tract. 219 With respect to outdoor concentrations of VOCs, a study found ASPEN's modeled estimates to be reasonably accurate when compared with actual exposures measured by personal monitors.220 The study did find, however, that the ASPEN model underestimated concentrations of VOCs that have significant indoor sources.221 To account for individual movements and exposures to varying 217.

Those models estimate apparent concentrations of inhalation exposures based on census data, human activity patterns, indoor and outdoor concentration relationships, and other data. 222 Another pollution exposure model, the Operational Street Pollution Model (\"OSPM\"), estimates exposure to street pollution in urban areas.223 Researchers have used this microenvironmental model to estimate the pollution exposure of workers like bus drivers and letter carriers. The OSPM incorporates data on traffic, street configuration, and bus schedules with information contributed from diaries. 224 The OSPM predictions have proved accurate when compared with actual measurements from personal monitors.225 A childhood cancer study also used the same model; utilizing street addresses and other information, the study estimated the exposure of children to nitrogen dioxide and benzene.226 Researchers can incorporate GIS into modeling programs to account for buildings, street configurations, and other geographic features. This provides more accurate and refined estimates of exposure. 227 Such modeling programs can include multiple sources of pollutants and can reconstruct past exposures.228 For example, the OSPM has been integrated with GIS technology to create an exposure model that predicts past, present, and future exposures to selected single-source ambient-air pollutants from traffic\u2014benzene, carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide, and ozone. 229 This model achieves both a high spatial and temporal resolution.230 The integrated model uses GIS technology to provide the required input parameters for the OSPM\u2014digital maps with geocoded buildings and addresses, traffic and population data, and meteorological 222.

Attributing Exposure The use of these improved environmental monitoring and modeling techniques is not limited to estimating past, present, or future exposure to emissions. These techniques could also be used to attribute exposure to a particular source. For example, litigants in Superfund cases 235 already use contaminant transport models.236 These models determine and allocate liability for past contamination by estimating the origin and timing of contaminant releases. 237 There are other environmental forensic techniques that identify the source of contaminants from among several potential sources. For example, chemical finger printing, weathering pattern analysis, chemical biomarker analysis, isotopic analysis, and other developing techniques can help trace releases of petroleum hydrocarbons, chlorinated solvents, and other chemicals to their sources.238 231. See id. at 7. 232. See id. at 7, 37.

Identifying Effects of Exposure Proving specific causation not only requires proving an exposure pathway, but it also requires tracin g the harmful result to that pathway.239 Whether based on environmental monitoring or modeling, predicting levels of toxicants in individuals requires simplifying assumptions about personal habits, lifestyles, genetic factors, and the like. 240 But a more accurate picture of an individual's intake and absorption levels can be achieved by monitoring an individual's actual contaminant levels. Such monitoring will be increasingly feasible thanks to advances in biomonitoring and toxicogenomics. Ultimately, toxicogenomic assays may permit researchers not only to detect exposure to specific chemicals,241 but also to quantify an individual's level and duration of exposure.242 These analyses could satisfy specific causation if the exposure was to a substance that was produced only by the defendant. Causation would then be established if the exposure resulted in either a unique gene expression pattern in the victim or a chemical-specific genetic mutation comparable to a fingerprint. 243 Toxicogenomics has not yet resolved certain key issues, such as determining how representative a particular gene expression pattern may be or establishing the time period in which gene expression changes follow toxic exposure. But the potential is there. 244 III. A PROPOSAL FOR A NEW, RISK-BASED ADMINISTRATIVE APPROACH Part I detailed the inadequacies of the traditional tort system.

This part explores what such a system would look like. A. EARLIER ADMINISTRATIVE PROPOSALS The inadequacies of the tort system have previously prompted a limited number of proposals for handling environmental tort claims administratively.245 These proposals aimed to reduce the barriers to victims that prevent recovery. But these proposals offered only limited prospects for better addressing compensation, deterrence, and fairness goals. The flaw in these proposals, as in the tort system, is that they rely on costly and time-consuming individualized adjudications. 1. Environmental Law Institute Proposal One of the earliest of these proposals, 246 found in a model toxic tort statute drafted by the Environmental Law Institute (\"ELI\") in 1983, sought to compensate toxic tort victims who were unable to identify a financially viable defendant.247 Under this proposal, a fund would be generated from three sources: a tax on petroleum and chemical production, an annual hazard fee that roughly reflected the risk-generating characteristics of the substances produced, and public revenues.248 A person injured from exposure to a hazardous substance could either (1) proceed in tort and seek 245. See, e.g. , Clifford Fisher, The Role of Causation in Science as Law and Proposed Changes in the Current Common Law Toxic Tort System , 9 B UFF. ENVTL . L.J. 35 Thoughts , supra note 15; Trauberman, supra note 24. 246. Another early proposal involved creating an administrative board that would undertake the tasks of claims adjustment, adjudication of technical and scientific issues, and regulation of toxic substances. Stephen M. Soble, A Proposal for the Administrative Compensation of Victims of Toxic Substance Pollution: A Model Act , 14 H ARV. J. ON LEGIS. 683, 730 (1977). The board's primary function would be to certify claimants as victims of toxic-substance injuries if they made sufficient showings of causation, and to order the responsible pollution source to compensate those victims. Id. at 732. With respect to causation, the victim would have to demonstrate that the alleged polluter generated a toxic substance, that an exposure pathway from the polluter to the victim existed, and that the pollution \"resulted in the etiology of the injury or disease claimed.\" Id. at 796-97. Such a showing would then shift the burden of proof to the emitter, who would then have to disprove causation. Id. at 797. Because this proposal resembles the ELI and Rabin proposals described in the main text, infra Sections III.A.1, III.A.2, it is not discussed further. Each of these proposals treats causation similarly and would require individualized causation inquiries, although the Soble proposal would require the most detailed inquiry. 247. See Trauberman, supra note 24, at 179-83. A study group created by the 1980 Superfund statute made a proposal similar to the ELI proposal. See Rabin, Some Thoughts , supra note 15, at 960. The study group proposal was limited in scope to the compensation of harm arising from exposure to hazardous waste. It would have been funded by taxes on both the production of chemicals and the disposal of hazardous waste. See id. at 960-61. 248. Trauberman, supra note 24, at 241-42, 272-78. 2005] BEYOND TORT 1483 full damages, or (2) file a claim against the fund.249 The fund, however, would compensate only for pecuniary losses, not for pain and suffering.250 The fund would thus serve only as an alternative source of compensation. Claimants against the fund would only have to demonstrate that they suffered from a covered disease and that their toxic exposure was a substantial factor in causing that disease. 251 No showing of fault would be required.252 Claimants would then have the benefit of a rebuttable presumption of causation. They would be compensated unless the fund could show that the exposure was not a substantial causal factor.253 The fund would have subrogation rights and could seek to recover against the party who caused the injury.254 Claimants could not subsequently initiate tort actions unless they first reimbursed the fund for both the benefits received and administrative costs. 255 The ELI proposal was intended to be an \"interim solution\" to supplement the tort system.256 Although the proposed system would have made proving causation somewhat easi er, causation disputes would have still been inevitable. Causation disputes would have still existed when the fund sought to overcome the presumption of causation or when the fund brought subrogation proceedings against polluters. Furthermore, the proposal's funding mechanism represented only a half-hearted effort at achieving deterrence. As the proposal's authors acknowledged, the funding mechanism represented a \"compromise\" 257\u2014then-available scientific techniques and data were inadequate to support a more refined system. Ultimately, deterrence would not be efficiently achieved by a model that removed tortfeasors from direct responsibility for the harms they caused. Political support for such a system would likely be thin. 258 249. Id. at 216. 250. Id. at 237-38, 263, 265-68. 251. Id. at 263.

The proposed funding mechanism was modeled on the funding scheme of the federal Superfund. At its inception, the Superfund relied primarily on taxes on petroleum and chemical feedstocks. See id. at 242. This tax expired in 1995 and has not been reauthorized. The money available in the Superfund has since dwindled. General tax funds have been used to finance cleanups, but the number of Superfund cleanups has declined. See Eric Pianin, Superfund Faces Struggle for Room in the Budget , WASH. POST, Sept. 14, 2003, at A9. Similarly, as described below, the initial industry support for a Japanese administrative compensation scheme gradually gave way to complaints that industry 1484 SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA LAW REVIEW [Vol. 78:1439 2. Rabin's Proposal In 1993, Robert Rabin made a proposal designed to harness the potential of the tort system to identify toxic health hazards that would be compensable under an administrative system.259 Rabin adopted the ELI's plan to fund a compensation system in part through a fee that roughly reflected the risk-generating character of contributing industries. 260 In addition, Rabin's proposal created a designated list of toxic substances that would serve as the basis for determining liability in mass toxic claims.261 First, injured individuals would make a binding choice whether to proceed administratively or in tort.262 If they chose the administrative option, claimants would then be required to make an individualized showing that they had been exposed to one of the listed substances. 263 Claimants would be compensated only for pecuniary losses related to particular, listed harms.264 Rabin also proposed a \"switching\" mechanism that transferred cases from the judicial system to the administrative system. If sufficiently numerous tort claims involved a particular unlisted substance, a special judicial panel could order those claims to be \"switched\" into the administrative system. 265 This mechanism would thus capitalize on new information about toxic risks developed in litigation.266 Like the ELI model, Rabin's proposal retained the tort system as an alternative form of relief. Rabin's unwillingness to part with the tort system may be attributable in part to his skepticism that science would be able to members were being forced to bear unfair burdens. See infra Section IV.A. Both of these experiences illustrate the political difficulty of maintaining an industry-wide tax to support a liability scheme. See also Rabin, Some Thoughts , supra note 15, at 977 (\"Fairness considerations serve as an alternative rationale for creating as close a linkage as possible between risk-producing activities and financial responsibility for the consequences.\"). 259. See Rabin, Some Thoughts , supra note 15, at 965. Rabin also considered other models in designing his proposed scheme, including the compensation and limited liability scheme for nuclear accidents under the Price-Anderson Act, as well as the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act of 1986. Id. at 955-60. 260. Id. at 977. Rabin suggested, however, that there may be little practical difference between a flat tax and a risk-sensitive schedule of charges because of the unforeseeability of the risks and the disinclination of management to consider long-term consequences. Nevertheless, he recognized that corrective justice concerns could justify risk-specific charges. Id. But see Arlen, supra note 87, at 1099 (contending that \"[e]xperience rating is more important than Rabin suggests\" because proper deterrence requires that \"each injurer bears more directly the costs of the risks she actually creates\"). 261.

See id. 2005] BEYOND TORT 1485 provide sufficiently reliable risk information to support an administrative compensation system.267 In addition, for Rabin's model, the tort system would serve as a \"fail-safe\" option for the most severely disabled, who might be undercompensated by an administrative system.268 Also, the tort system would guarantee that ceilings on compensation in an administrative system would not be set too low. 269 The tort option might, however, appeal more to those plaintiffs who had the strongest cases for recovery\u2014the same cases that could be handled the most efficiently by an administrative system. 270 As a general rule, allowing such individuals to opt out of an administrative system would tend to undermine the system's economies of scale.271 3. Fisher's Proposal In 2001, Clifford Fisher made another administrative proposal, described as an \"Environmental Compensation program\" patterned after the workers' compensation system.272 The proposal would require industry to buy pollution compensation insurance. Victims would receive compensation if they demonstrated \"injuries of a type that some credible scientific evidence suggests may be causally related to exposure to a toxic substance.\" 273 Any time after exposure, victims could file claims to recover either for exposure to risk or for actual physical injury.274 But if there was uncertainty as to whether exposure caused a victim's disease, compensation would be discounted.275 Claims would be handled by the insurance industry, although an independent panel of medical experts would weigh the evidence and make compensation decisions on a case-by-case basis.276 Fisher contended that his proposal \"wou ld eliminate the problems of toxic tort causation\" and result in lower transaction costs.277 267. See id. at 979 (noting that most toxic-listing mechanisms, such as California's Proposition 65, see supra text accompanying note 117, do not purport to establish a foundation for individual claims of personal harm). 268. Id. at 976. 269. Id. at 975-76. 270. Arlen, supra note 87, at 1096. 271. As Rabin noted, one key advantage of an administrative approach over the tort system is its ability to process a high volume of claims. See Rabin, Some Thoughts , supra note 15, at 965. 272. See Fisher, supra note 245 (outlining the proposed scheme). 273. Id. at 142. 274. See id. at 149. 275. See id. at 149-50. 276. See id. at 143, 147-48. 277. Id. at 161. 1486 SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA LAW REVIEW [Vol. 78:1439 Despite that contention, Fisher's proposal creates a number of concerns. First, under the proposal, a victim would simply submit a claim for compensation \"to the insurance industry.\" 278 But if victims are unable to correctly identify the specific pollution source that caused their injuries, insurers would be unable to adjust premiums to account for risk. Second, a claimant's burden of proof would be so minimal that the proposal would encourage poorly supported claims. Lowering the burden of proof pressures risk-creators to generate information on risk, but it also shifts the biases of the compensation system toward overdeterrence and overcompensation. 279 Third, the cost and efficiency benefits of the proposal would be relatively modest\u2014the proposal would simply replace individualized judicial determinations with individualized administrative ones. Indeed, because claims could be premised on exposure to risk, the number of individualized claims would likely overwhelm the proposed panel of experts. B. THE NEW PROPOSAL Earlier administrative proposals that address environmental toxic injury have failed to capitalize on the ability of administrative systems to process a large volume of cases. Also, prior proposals have not accounted for current or future scientific advances. What kind of an administrative system might then be appropriate, given these advances and considering society's goals of compensation, deterrence, and fairness? A proposed system should take advantage of the refined and individualized assessments of risk that will be possible through increasingly sophisticated monitoring, toxicogenomics, modeling, and biomonitoring techniques. To advance deterrence and compensation goals, assessments of risk should be as accurate as possible, in quantifying risks and in identifying risk generators and persons exposed to risk. Nevertheless, as previously noted, administrative systems have relatively modest informational requirements compared to the tort system. 280 Thus, administrative systems can address situations of limited knowledge more adequately. The administrative system proposed here would internalize health- related pollution costs through a risk-based liability and compensation system. The federal government would assess individualized levies on pollution sources, taking advantage of an economy of scale unavailable to 278. Id. at 143. 279. See infra Section V.B.3. 280. See supra notes 105-08 and accompanying text. 2005] BEYOND TORT 1487 the states alone.281 The government would then use the revenues collected through the levies to make redistributions to persons exposed to pollution. The proposed system would coexist with current environmental standards, which would continue to provide a basic level of protection for human health and the environment. Because such a system would nevertheless represent a drastic departure from the present tort system, this Article offers a proposal that is more conceptual than detailed in nature. A finalized system would need to be refined in light of experience and technological developments. 1. Levies on Pollution Sources In order to provide appropriate deterrence incentives, this proposal would have the federal government collect from pollution sources levies that reflect the human health costs of the pollution. The amount of each levy would depend on the amount of pollutants released by a polluter, as well as the likely exposure of persons to the pollutants, the risk of harm due to such exposure, 282 and the expected costs to the victims of such harm.283 This proposal would require significant pollution sources to make these payments if chemicals are released above designated threshold levels. The 281. See Daniel C. Esty, Revitalizing Environmental Federalism , 95 M ICH. L. REV. 570, 614-15 (1996). For example, data collection, analysis, and risk assessment are highly technical activities that involve significant economies of scale. Id. 282. A risk-based liability system, as opposed to a harm-based liability system, mitigates the problem of \"moral luck\" by treating individuals with identical culpability the same. See Ehud Guttel & Alon Harel, Probability Matching and the Law: A New Behavioral Challenge to Law and Economics 28 (2004) (Am. Law & Econ. Ass'n, Working Paper No. 39), available at http://www.law.bepress.com/ alea/14th/art39/. 283. The process of quantifying these costs likely will involve some controversy.

If numerous pollution sources feature very diffuse effects, it may be simpler and more cost- efficient to achieve deterrence and compensation through general taxes. Spending could also be focused on preventive care. 1488 SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA LAW REVIEW [Vol. 78:1439 proposal would collect the levies through an environmental permitting process or tax system.284 In return for making payments into the system, a pollution source would be shielded from potential tort liability to the extent that its payments covered known or accounted-for risks. Thus, the administrative system would not replace the tort system altogether; rather, it would function alongside the tort system. The scope of the administrative system would extend to substances for which sufficiently reliable information exists regarding health risks. Substa nces whose health effects are unknown or inadequately understood, however, would remain outside the administrative system and could be the subject of tort litigation if adverse effects are discovered in the future. 285 For example, if an oil refinery's sulfur dioxide emissions were expected to cause fifty additional cases of lung disease and ten additional deaths per year, the refinery would make a payment to the administrative system reflecting the costs of those injuries. In return, the refinery would be released from potential tort liability for lung disease arising from exposure to the sulfur dioxide. The refinery would remain subject to potential tort liability, however, to the extent that it releases other harmful pollutants not covered by the system. In addition, the refinery would remain liable for unexpected types of harm caused by the sulfur dioxide emissions. As explained below, the administrative system would distribute the funds collected to exposed individuals in the community. 2. Distributions to Exposed Persons Preferably, the administrative system would employ a compensation- for-risk approach, in which each individual would have a personal account within the system. In order to shield pollution sources from tort liability for risks covered by the system, individuals would not be allowed to opt out of the system to pursue tort claims. Each individual's account would receive payments based on that individual's estimated exposure, above a minimal threshold, to pollution from sources contributing to the system. Air modeling or sampling could be used to estimate exposure in different microenvironments. Using reasonable modeling of exposure pathways, these estimates could be based on an individual's residence and place of 285. Tort liability reinforces administrative regulation in two ways. First, it serves as a safety net if agencies lack jurisdiction or resources to address certain risks. Second, it provides a decisionmaking authority that is at least partially independent from political pressures. See FRIED & ROSENBERG , supra note 162, at 79-80. 2005] BEYOND TORT 1489 work. Biomonitoring and other sampling methods could provide more accurate estimates of exposure, but would raise greater privacy and cost concerns. Because the purpose of the accounts would be to compensate individuals for their exposure and the resulting increased risk of injury, the proposal would limit use of account funds to insurance, medical expenses, preventative care, or similar types of expenditures. Alternatively, the system could distribute revenues based on actual physical injury as opposed to mere exposure. This option would direct resources to persons with the greatest need, but would also entangle the system in questions of specific causation. Namely, payments made by a pollution source into the system would be sufficient to compensate only for the increased disease incidence caused by that source. It would not be sufficient to compensate for the base rate disease incidence. To be financially sound, the system would have to distinguish between cases caused by exposure to pollution sources that had contributed into the system, for which payments would be made, and all other cases. 286 Drawing these distinctions would require the administrative system to wrestle with the same difficult specific causation issues that challenge the tort system. In contrast to compensation for injury, compensation for increased risk avoids difficult specific causation issues. 287 Because exposure to risk of harm would trigger compensation payments, there would be no need to determine whether an injury later occurred or why. Such issues give rise to many, if not most, of the costs and procedural problems that accompany mass tort litigation. 288 These issues are especially problematic in environmental toxic injury cases. Moreover, by providing compensation in advance of any injury, the compensation-for-risk approach enables individuals to pay for medical monitoring or preventative care. Such measures can reduce an individual's overall risk while ameliorating the psychic anxiety of anticipated future 286. Under this arrangement, political pressure might tend to broaden eligibility for compensation to cover all cases, as happened with the federal black lung program. See infra Section IV.D. 287. Cf. Leslie, supra note 38, at 1848 (noting in the toxic tort context that if plaintiffs no longer have to prove specific causation, Daubert hearings will involve fewer experts and will entail lower costs). But to the extent that a compensation-for-risk system avoids specific causation determinations, the primary goal of corrective justice\u2014establishing the causal connection between tortfeasors and victims\u2014is not addressed. Cf. Geistfeld, supra note 46, at 1024 (noting that tort norms based on corrective justice make causation an essential predicate of liability). 288. See FRIED & ROSENBERG , supra note 162, at 96-97 (\"The effort to tailor judgments to the specific legal and factual features of an individual claim . . . to determine 'specific causation' is enormously expensive.\"); Abraham, supra note 143, at 887. 1490 SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA LAW REVIEW [Vol. 78:1439 injury. Admittedly, compensation-for-risk payments would not provide full compensation for individuals whose exposure later resulted in actual injuries to their health. 289 The exception would be the rare case where compensation is paid for an exposure that bears a one hundred percent risk that actual injury will result. Individuals could, however, address this compensation gap by using compensation proceeds to pay for insurance. 290 An administrative system should accommodate such expenditures by allowing individuals to use funds to purchase insurance to cover medical expenses, loss of income, or disability. 291 Restricting individuals' use of compensation proceeds to insurance, medical expenses, and preventative care would educate and remind the public of the purpose of the compensation payments. The restriction would promote corrective justice by ensuring that compensation actually addresses the harm caused by the polluter. It would also allay one potential overcompensation concern\u2014some may presume that if a person does not suffer physical injury, there is no \"harm\" and thus there should be no compensation. Although this overcompensation argument makes the debatable assumption that the burden of potential injury is not a real harm, 292 restricting the use of proceeds to purposes that alleviate health risks will prevent compensation from becoming a windfall. 3. The Informational Foundation The informational needs of the proposed administrative system would be significant. At least two existing databases may help to identify pollutants to be covered by the system and help to establish research priorities: (1) the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry 289. Robinson, supra note 16, at 786-87 (explaining that, in the absence of insurance, a victim's ex ante recovery for risk of harm is insufficient to cover actual losses). 290. See Note, supra note 26, at 1517 (noting that awards of risk-based damages do not undercompensate plaintiffs who later develop diseases if the plaintiffs are able to purchase insurance with discounted damage proceeds). 291. See Andrew R. Klein, A Model for Enhanced Risk Recovery in Tort , 56 W ASH. & LEE L. REV. 1173, 1188 & n.77 (1999) (noting that several commentators have proposed compensating for enhanced risk by allowing exposed persons to recover insurance premiums designed to cover the risk of future disease). Compensation-for-risk payments would cover only the portion of insurance premiums that represent the incremental risk due to exposure. Individuals would have to supplement the compensation-for-risk distribution with their own funds. See Robinson, supra note 16, at 787 (noting that recovery for risk provides immediate compensation, but that a person exposed to risk must either bear or insure against any residual loss). An alternative would be to require polluters to purchase insurance policies to cover diseases that exposed individuals are at risk of developing. See Note, supra note 26, at 1520. Such an approach, however, would require either that cases caused by background risk be distinguished or that polluters also bear the cost of such cases. 292. See Robinson, supra note 16, at 786. 2005] BEYOND TORT 1491 (\"ATSDR\"), which gathers toxicological information;293 the EPA's Information database.294 ATSDR has produced \"toxicological profiles\" for arsenic, lead, mercury, and over 270 other hazardous substances.295 The EPA and ATSDR prioritize the hazardous substances to be profiled based on the frequency of occurrence at toxic waste sites, toxicity, and potential for human exposure. 296 Each peer-reviewed profile reviews research on the substance's toxicologic properties and characterizes information on toxicity and adverse health effects. Each profile includes: (1) an identification of major sources of release to the environment, based on data from the Toxics Release Inventory; 297 (2) the potential for human exposure through various routes; and (3) the potential health effects, including estimated levels of exposure at which carcinogenic and noncarcinogenic health effects may occur. 298 For each profiled substance, ATSDR also determines whether adequate information on health effects is available. If such information is not available, ATSDR, in cooperation with the National Toxicology Program, initiates research to determine those health effects. 299 The EPA's less-detailed IRIS database summarizes the EPA's consensus position on the potential adverse effects of over 500 chemicals. 300 For each chemical, the database lists estimated oral and inhalation unit risks of carcinogenic effects\u2014the risk of cancer for exposure to a given concentration of pollutant.301 The database also lists 293. Pursuant to the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (\"CERCLA\"), ATSDR, in conjunction with the EPA, maintains a list of hazardous substances most commonly found at facilities on the CERCLA National Priorities List. ATSDR prepares toxicological profiles for each substance on the list and ascertains significant human exposure levels with associated health effects. See 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 9604(i) (2000).

The panel could also act on petitions by parties who submit data on toxic risks associated with unlisted substances. 303 Thus, the panel would apply its expertise both in making listing decisions and in assessing the risk data used to determine the contributions and payments required by the system. A separate panel with economic and ethical expertise could address the determination of the appropriate payment levels. C. COMPARISON WITH EARLIER PROPOSALS The risk-based proposal presented in this Article differs from the earlier administrative proposals in several important respects. First, compensation would be based on exposure to risk rather than on physical injury. The greatest advantage of risk-based compensation is that it makes questions of specific causation irrelevant. Although the ELI and Rabin proposals attempt to sidestep the issue of specific causation by creating a presumption of liability, 304 that issue nevertheless persists because the presumptions are rebuttable. Although the Fisher proposal allows victims to file claims any time after exposure, it too retains an individualized causation inquiry, albeit a cursory one. Additionally, a risk-based proposal has the advantage of automatically aggregating compensation funds from multiple pollution sources. This facilitates the purchase of preventative care or insurance. 305 Second, the risk-based proposal more precisely tailors the levies on pollution sources to match the risks generated.306 Both the ELI and Rabin information, IRIS \"can be used for characterization of the public health risks of a given chemical in a given situation.\" Id. The EPA cautions, however, that \"IRIS values cannot be validly used to accurately predict the incidence of human disease or the type of effects that chemical exposures have on humans.\" See U.S. EPA, IRIS Limitations, http://www.epa.gov/iris/limits.htm (last visited Sept. 24, 2005). 302. See U.S. EPA, supra note 294. 303. Cf. Rabin, Some Thoughts , supra note 15, at 968 (proposing the creation of a similar panel of scientists). 304. See id. at 967. 305. See supra Section III.B.2. 306. See Arlen, supra note 87, at 1098 (\"For deterrence purposes, the cost of an injurer's risky activity is best measured as the cost of the risk she imposes on each affected person, not the cost of any resulting injuries.\"). 2005] BEYOND TORT 1493 proposals would have been partially funded by industry-based hazard fees, with only a limited effort made to incorporate risk generation into their financing schemes. Although these earlier proposals would be simpler to implement, their funding would not rest on scientifically generated risk assessment data. The Fisher proposal relies on insurance carriers to account for risks by adjusting premiums, but, as noted above, such adjustments can be made only if claimants trace their injuries directly to pollution sources. The risk-based proposal, like the ELI and Rabin proposals, envisions a continuing role for the tort system. The risk-based proposal, however, makes a greater commitment to the administrative system by eliminating all potential tort liability for risks covered by the system. The exclusivity of coverage under either the tort or administrative systems guards against overdeterrence and overcompensation while enhancing the political viability of the proposal. 307 Although any proposal will face opposition from the business community to the extent that it requires compensation for costs that are not currently internalized, the levies contemplated by the ELI and Rabin proposals would likely encounter strong opposition because paying the levies would not protect against tort liability. While the risk-based proposal lacks the Rabin proposal's mechanism for switching claims from the tort system to the administrative system, it nevertheless leaves room for the tort system to play a role. The tort system could be used to identify substances that should be incorporated into the administrative system, perhaps through a petitioning process. IV. FEASIBILITY OF THE PROPOSAL: LESSONS FROM OTHER ADMINISTRATIVE SYSTEMS The proposed system is theoretically attractive and scientifically plausible. The question remains whether it is practically feasible. This part addresses feasibility by discussing domestic and foreign precedents for replacing substantial portions of the tort system with an administrative compensation system. In particular, this part examines the lessons to be gleaned from those precedents. Perhaps the most germane proposal comes from Japan, where the government adopted an administrative compensation system for pollution-related illnesses in the 1970s. 308 In the same decade, 307. Cf. Charles D. Kolstad, Thomas S. Ulen & Gary V. Johnson, Ex Post Liability for Harm vs. Ex Ante Safety Regulation: Substitutes or Complements? , 80 A M. ECON. REV. 888, 889 (1990) (arguing that ex ante regulatory standards should be set at a socially optimal level of safety only where ex post liability cannot be imposed, but if ex ante and ex post policies are used jointly, then ex ante standards should be set at a socially suboptimal level). 308. See infra Section IV.A.1. 1494 SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA LAW REVIEW [Vol. 78:1439 New Zealand partially replaced tort claims by instituting a no-fault administrative compensation system for accident-related personal injuries. 309 In the early twentieth century, individual states in this country began to replace tort and contract actions arising from workplace injuries with workers' compensation systems.310 On a more limited scale, the Federal Government adopted the Black Lung Program, which compensated retired coal miners for respiratory disease.311 Although all of these systems have encountered difficulties and undergone reforms, they demonstrate the potential advantages of administrative systems and suggest issues to consider when designing an administrative compensation scheme. A. POLLUTION COMPENSATION IN JAPAN Japan adopted a compensation program to address the precise problems identified in this Article\u2014the failure of the tort system to internalize the costs of pollution and its failure to provide adequate compensation to environmental tort victims. Although its scope has narrowed, the Japanese program continues to operate today. 1. Description Japan's adoption of this administrative system was prompted by two factors: the serious industrial pollution that accompanied the country's rapid economic growth starting in the 1950s, and the related rising incidence of pollution-related diseases near certain industrial facilities. 312 Dissatisfied with mediation as a means to resolve pollution-related conflicts, victims turned to the courts and filed negligence claims.313 Despite difficult proof requirements and the absence of discovery mechanisms, victims won several important decisions in which industrial polluters were held liable. 314 These decisions expanded environmental civil liability through four doctrinal innovations: (1) interpreting negligence to 309.

The first three of these cases consisted of two actions against large chemical companies for mercury poisoning and one action against a mining company alleging that cadmium discharge had caused a painful bone syndrome called Itai-itai (\"Ouch, ouch\"). A fourth suit named six defendants\u2014a petroleum refinery, a power plant, and four chemical plants\u2014and alleged that their discharge of sulfur oxides jointly caused the plaintiffs' injuries. Id. 2005] BEYOND TORT 1495 essentially impose strict liability, (2) allowing causation to be proved by epidemiological evidence, (3) applying a form of joint and several liability, and (4) calculating damages through a \"comprehensive method\" that provided for standardized damage calculations based on degree of injury.315 This last innovation eliminated the ne ed to estimate victims' incomes, which resulted in courts being able to handle a larger volume of cases.316 Despite these innovations, environmental tort litigation in Japan remained inefficient and inadequate for those plaintiffs who could not prove causation. 317 Nevertheless, such innovations pressured industry to pursue alternatives to tort, thus laying the foundation for the 1973 Pollution-Related Health Damage Compensation Law.318 This law established an administrative compensation program, financed primarily through taxes on industry based on sulfur oxide emissions. 319 This program provided disability benefits, reimbursement for medical expenses, and compensation for lost earnings.320 The Compensation Law provided compensation to a certified victim of a designated disease who lived in a designated area.321 A polluted area could be designated as either Class I or Class II.322 Class I areas contained extreme air pollution and a substantial number of victims of respiratory disease. 323 Four respiratory diseases\u2014emphysema, chronic bronchitis, asthma, and asthmatic bronchitis\u2014were defined as designated diseases in Class I areas.324 Although these diseases could be caused by multiple sources, victims were not required to demonstrate that pollution was a \"but for\" cause in order to receive compensation.325 Class II areas were those where a causal relationship between a disease and pollution was deemed to be clearly established. 326 The legislature identified three signature diseases 315.

Sulfur oxide emissions were chosen for the following reasons: (1) the evidence indicated that sulfur dioxide was a principal cause of illnesses, (2) the government had the 2005] BEYOND TORT 1497 automobiles paid for the remaining twenty percent.335 Of those costs allocated to emitters of sulfur oxides, ninety percent would be paid by facilities located in Class I areas based on their emissions during the previous year. The remainder would be paid by facilities outside Class I areas. 336 From an economic perspective, the design of the Class I levy was far from ideal. Using sulfur oxide emissions as a basis for the levy was driven primarily by the desire to establish a convenient way to finance compensation payments. The desire to internalize pollution costs accurately was less important. 337 The scheme ignored nitrogen oxides, carbon monoxide, and particulates, even though they were also believed to contribute to the designated respiratory diseases.338 Moreover, the government made no attempt to internalize costs accurately, even with respect to sulfur oxide emissions. Instead, levies on present sulfur oxide polluters paid for the costs of harms from past emissions.339 In an attempt to make the system fairer, the government subsequently raised levy rates in areas with higher concentrations of claimants.340 As sulfur oxide emissions declined, however, the government had to increase per-ton levies across the board to ensure sufficient funds for compensation. 341 Increased levies in the face of declining sulfur oxide emissions generated pressure from the business community to cancel the Class I area designations.342 At the same time, there was growing recognition of the importance of nitrogen oxide pollution as a cause of disease.343 Rather than incorporating nitrogen oxide emissions as a basis for levy collection, however, the government cancelled all Class I area designations in 1988, which prevented more patients from being most data on sulfur dioxide and best understood the problem of controlling it, and (3) sulfur oxide emissions could be easily calculated and monitored.

Indeed, administrators downplayed the regulatory aspects of the levy because charges based on exact emissions were considered to be impractical and politically infeasible.

Lessons from Japan Compared to the present proposal, Japan's pollution compensation system was limited in scope\u2014it was designed to respond to a small number of pollution problems in specific geographic areas. 346 Furthermore, contextual nuances must be weighed when drawing lessons from Japan's experience. Compared to the United States' legal system, Japan's legal system has traditionally been more receptive to the independent administrative resolution of disputes, which is preferred to judicial intervention. 347 Nevertheless, Japan's experience is instructive in several ways. First, thoughtful and equitable design is critical. Using levies on sources of present pollution to fund the compensation payments to victims of past pollution ultimately undermined the Class I system. For this reason, emitters reasonably contended that it was unfair to hold them financially responsible for illnesses caused by other polluters. 348 From the perspective of industry, causation standards were so relaxed that the system became a no-fault compensation scheme that had little deterrent effect.349 The Class I system's rough-justice approach might have survived these criticisms were it not for the drastic decline in sulfur oxide emissions. This decline underscored how greatly the system had departed from the polluter-pays principle. By arguing that the system discouraged further emissions reductions, industry succeeded both in challenging sulfur oxide emissions as a basis for levies and in eliminating the Class I levy itself. 350 The decline in sulfur oxide emissions also highlighted how incomplete the knowledge base for the system was. The intent of the law had been to ensure the rapid support for victims of environmental pollution; the scientific basis was a secondary concern. 351 Sulfur oxide emissions could be readily measured, and thus offered a convenient basis for computing 344. T SURU , supra note 328, at 149-50. 345. See Stewart, supra note 327, at 486-87; Weidner, supra note 328, at 161. 346. See DEWEES ET AL ., supra note 12, at 330. 347.

See Weidner, supra note 328, at 154. 2005] BEYOND TORT 1499 levies.352 Industry, government, and victims all had an interest in having the Compensation Law enacted. Industry was willing to accept uncertainty and policy compromises as long as its financial burden was low. 353 Once costs escalated, however, industry complained that it was paying more than its fair share and demanded a more economically rational basis for the pollution levies. 354 Japan's experience with Class I areas carries several implications for the system proposed in this Article. Stakeholders in the system must view it as equitable. The polluter-pays principle may be an appropriate guiding criterion, but the system must assess specific levies and distribute payments equitably. 355 Furthermore, the system must have adequate monitoring mechanisms to guard against evasion. At a minimum, the system must be based on reliable mechanisms of revenue collection. In addition, the proposed system must be grounded in well-developed and defensible scientific knowledge. The fact that Japan's Class II designations fared better politically than its Class I designations 356 can be attributed to two factors: the greater certainty of the data regarding causation in Class II areas, and the more plausible link between responsible parties and compensated victims. 357 One should not interpret Japan's scaling back of Class I compensation as a repudiation of the concept of an administrative compensation system. 358 The compensation scheme was left untouched in Class II areas. Even with respect to Class I areas, public sentiment actually favored 352. G RESSER ET AL ., supra note 312, at 316. 353. Id. at 311. 354. Id. 355. Assessing liability in proportion to the probability of each company's contribution to actual injury will likely still encounter industry opposition. But a fair and accurate determination of probabilities will weaken the basis for such opposition. See, e.g. , Stewart, supra note 327, at 497-98 (noting that Japanese companies' consistent opposition to the Class I compensation system suggests that they would have fought for specific causal showings). 356. This is not to overlook grievances by Class II victims, who complained that the criteria for disease certification were unreasonably restrictive. See G RESSER ET AL ., supra note 312, at 308. One commentator has suggested that the certification board's close scrutiny of Class II claimants' medical tests and history of exposure essentially required such claimants to demonstrate individual causation. See Stewart, supra note 327, at 481 & n.37. 357. Industry also had less of an incentive to seek repeal of the Class II designations as far fewer persons were certified in Class II areas. See GRESSER ET AL ., supra note 312, at 304-05; supra note 328. 358. One commentator has suggested that an appropriate compensation scheme would combine Class I and Class II features. Compensation would be awarded when exposure to an alleged toxic substance was established and alternate sources of injury were ruled out. A showing of a statistically demonstrated increased risk of environmental health injury would be required.

Ultimately, Japan's experience demonstrates that a viable administrative compensation scheme must be fair and supported by sufficient data. B. ACCIDENT COMPENSATION IN NEW ZEALAND 1. Description Like Japan, New Zealand adopted an administrative compensation system in the 1970s. Unlike Japan, this system addressed accidents rather than pollution-related injury. The 1972 Accident Compensation Act (\"the Act\") replaced common law tort claims for accidental personal injury with a no-fault compensation system. 359 The enactment largely followed the recommendations of the Woodhouse Report.360 The Woodhouse Report noted the lottery-like nature of personal injury awards, the inadequacy of compensation under the existing workers' compensation system, and the limited availability of social security benefits. 361 The report recommended replacing this \"fragmented and capricious response\" to personal injury with a comprehensive no-fault compensation plan that would offer the prospect of more complete injury coverage with lower administrative costs. 362 Central to the Act was what the Woodhouse Report called the principle of \"community responsibility.\"363 Community responsibility refers to society's responsibility to compensate the \"random but statistically necessary victims\" of everyday activity in modern society. 364 Consistent with that principle, the Act emphasized the compensation of accident victims rather than the deterrence of individual causes of injury.365 The Act bars tort claims for death or personal injury caused by accidents. In its place, it mandates a no-fault system of compensation 359. See GASKINS , supra note 137, at 326-30. 360. N.Z.

Levy rates were based on the past accident-cost experience of the industrial group into which each employer fell. 373 The Motor Vehicle Compensation Fund was supported by levies on motor vehicle owners. Levies were based on the size, weight, and type of vehicle, with an additional levy on licensed drivers.374 General taxation financed the Supplementary Compensation Fund, which covered injured persons outside the Earner's or Motor Vehicle schemes.375 Although the statute authorized experience rating in the form of bonuses 366.

The previous scheme of comprehensive, social insurance was replaced by an individual accident insurance scheme. Accordingly, the Act reduced the scope of coverage and benefits. 378 Despite contentions that the most disabled members of society should have priority,379 the system continues to categorically exclude disease from coverage.380 The 1992 revisions also changed the funding mechanisms for the scheme. In response to complaints about unfairness and the failure to adjust individual levies for risk, the 1992 Act explicitly mandated experience rating for work injuries.381 The 1992 Act also removed the obligation that employers buy nonwork-injury insurance for their employees and instead required that employees buy such insurance themselves.382 Notwithstanding these changes, this compensation scheme has permanently supplanted the tort system for accidents in New Zealand. The scheme has survived relatively intact after three decades of analysis and revisions. As one commentator stated, \"[A] return to tort seems unthinkable.\" 383 2.

Lastly, the Act was implemented in a relatively homogeneous culture with a strong commitment to social welfare. 385 Nevertheless, the New Zealand experience sheds light on replacing a tort system with an administrative compensation scheme and demonstrates the potential thereby to reduce administrative costs. From the outset, critics attacked New Zealand's system as providing inadequate incentives for deterrence.386 Like Japan, New Zealand focused primarily on compensation. But the flat-rate levy on privately owned automobiles and the industry-based levy on employers represented only a crude reflection of risk.387 Until the 1992 revisions, system administrators failed to tailor such levies through differential assessments.388 A more balanced approach attuned to compensation and deterrence goals would have addressed complaints of inequity and created incentives for deterrence. Indeed, the New Zealand experience underscores the importance of gathering data to accurately estimate the risks on which the levies are based. The perception that employers were being unfairly taxed for injuries occurring outside the em ployment context helped to fuel a backlash against the system. In turn, this led to the 1992 modifications. A more fundamental shortcoming of the Act is its exclusion of disease, particularly environmental illness. Environmental illness would seem to be a prime candidate for inclusion in a compensation scheme premised on community responsibility given the disparate causes of these illnesses, the consequent difficulty of proving individual causation, and the universal vulnerability to disease-causing hazards in the environment. 389 Like the Act, the administrative scheme proposed here is partial; it would only cover diseases caused by environmental exposure. Distinguishing between environmental injuries and accidental injuries is appropriate because the tort system is relatively adequate to address the latter. Furthermore, it may appear unfair from a compensation perspective 384. G ASKINS , supra note 137, at 327-30. 385.

The need to dete r polluters, however, justifies a system that addresses the specific problem of environmental injury alone . Finally, it is encouraging to find that the costs of administering New Zealand's accident compensation system have proven manageable.390 Only about ten percent of the ACC's funds are expended for administrative purposes.391 This percentage represents a significant cost benefit when contrasted with the estimated forty percent overhead cost associated with the common law and workers' compensation systems that preceded the Act. 392 C. WORKERS ' COMPENSATION IN THE UNITED STATES Although the United States has never adopted an administrative system like Japan's,393 the American workers' compensation system does offer a relevant point of comparison. A comprehensive assessment of workers' compensation is beyond the scope of this Article, but the brief examination below offers insight into the feasibility of an analogous administrative system for environmental toxic injury. 1. Background The workers' compensation system was established in the United States in the early twentieth century in order to address the growing problem of employees injured on the job, who were often without 390. See Walter Gellhorn, Medical Malpractice Litigation (U.S.)\u2014Medical Mishap Compensation (N.Z.) , 73 C ORNELL L. REV. 170, 193 n.67 (1988). Although critics initially predicted that the transaction costs under the administrative system would be high, the savings have been described as \"substantial\" when compared to the tort system.

See Palmer, supra note 391, at 240. 393. The recent settlement agreement between the tobacco industry and the states, however, does provide an example of an ex ante approach. Under the agreement, the tobacco industry agreed to make payments to the states out of future revenues in return for protection against liability for past and future Medicaid costs. See Eric A. Posner, Tobacco Regulation or Litigation? , 70 U. CHI. L. REV. 1141, 1145 (2003). Thus, the settlement primarily spread the costs to future consumers of cigarettes rather than extracting a lump-sum damages payment from the industry. See id. 2005] BEYOND TORT 1505 compensation for medical costs and lost wages.394 Although injured employees could attempt to bring tort or contract claims against their employers, litigation was onerous and expensive. 395 Furthermore, employers often defeated workers' claims through such defenses as assumption of the risk, contributory negligence, and the fellow-servant rule. 396 Against this backdrop, the workers' compensation system was expected to benefit both employers and workers by replacing uncertain remedies with certain ones. Both sides benefited by avoiding the expenses and risks of tort litigation as injury disputes were channeled through a presumably cheaper administrative system. 397 The system was designed to provide compensation to the injured in a nonadversarial manner, without regard to fault. Employers received i mmunity from suit in return for paying premiums to support the system. 398 In 2001, workers' compensation programs in the United States covered nearly 127 million workers, cost employers $63.9 billion, and paid out $49.4 billion in benefits. 399 The difference between benefits and employer payments is explained by expenses such as administrative and loss-adjustment costs, taxes, and contributions for special funds.400 Administrative costs thus account for less than a quarter of total system costs, a figure that contrasts favorably with the share consumed by transaction costs in the tort system.401 These figures suggest the potential cost savings of adopting a compensation system that avoids individual disputes over causation.

Over the past two decades, employers have complained about the escalating costs of the workers' compensation system, while employees have complained of inadequate compensation.402 Although costs stabilized in the mid-1990s,403 with the number of claims following a downward trend, overall costs have risen dramatically in the last few years.404 These increases may be due to rising medical costs, to attempts by insurers to compensate for having previously charged insufficient premiums, or to increased involvement of lawyers in the claims process. 405 Meanwhile, the decline in benefits has been blamed on the introduction of managed care and other cost controls.406 California's recent workers' compensation \"crisis\" illustrates many of these difficulties.407 Historically, workers' compensation insurance rates in California were regulated under a minimum-rate law.408 This law required insurers to charge premiums no lower than rates set by the state insurance commissioner. 409 Rates were based on analyses of data for premiums and losses, as well as on actuarial projections and were designed to include all benefit and administrative costs.410 In 1993, however, California instituted an open-competition system in which insurers set their own rates, guided by state-developed, nonmandatory advisory rates.411 A price war ensued\u2014 insurers attempted to increase market share at rates that eventually proved 402. See, e.g. , Martha T. McCluskey, The Illusion of Efficiency in Workers' Compensation \"Reform,\" 50 R UTGERS L.

Unlike most other states, California had no standard course of treatment or payout for specific injuries. 413 As a result, many carriers went out of business or abandoned the state, leaving the publicly owned state compensation-insurance fund to cover more than half of the state's employers. 414 In 2003, California enacted legislation that restricted the number of medical visits per claimant and initiated a process to create a standardized system for treating injuries based on national medical standards. 415 In 2004, further legislation capped temporary disability payments, limited permanent disability payments to the percentage of injury incurred on the job, and incorporated an HMO-type system to provide medical care.416 2. Lessons from Workers' Compensation To be sure, the historical context that led to the adoption of workers' compensation differs from that of the present proposal. Workers' compensation responded to an evident crisis, while environmental toxic injury has not been viewed as such. But as technological advances enhance our ability to recognize injury, an administrative compensation system could offer the same advantages over tort that workers' compensation does: remedy, avoidance of litigation risks and expenses, and more efficient processing of large numbers of claims. 417 Plaintiffs are already relying on evidence of common genetic variations, known as polymorphisms, to argue that they were particularly susceptible to a substance that defendants released. 418 These plaintiffs argue that they face a higher relative risk of 412. See id. 413. See Herrera, supra note 407. Prior to the legislation passed in 2003, California imposed no limits on the number of times a worker could see a doctor for an injury. Also, an injured employee's doctor was presumed correct in all treatment decisions. See id. ; Roberto Ceniceros, California's Comp Woes Illustrate Risk that Reforms Can Backfire , BUS.

TIMES , Apr. 17, 2004, at A1. 417. Cf. Schroeder, supra note 104, at 474 (arguing that risk-averse individuals would prefer a system of risk-based liability, whereas risk-preferring individuals would prefer causation-based liability, and suggesting that the existence of insurance is evidence of risk aversion). 418. See Marchant, supra note 45, at 10,647. 1508 SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA LAW REVIEW [Vol. 78:1439 exposure than the general population does.419 Such cases hint at the potential litigation that may follow, as technological advances expand the class of potential plaintiffs. For instance, toxicogenomics may provide direct evidence of specific causation by revealing chemical-specific genetic markers of disease processes. 420 Furthermore, as gene expression assays are developed that provide reliable assessments of preclinical disease progression, exposed individuals who cannot demonstrate present injury may have stronger claims for medical monitoring.421 As litigation risk increases, polluters may come to view administrative compensation as an attractive alternative to tort. The present difficulties of the workers' compensation system in California nevertheless offer a cautionary lesson for the need to constrain costs in an administrative compensation system. In large part, efficiency advantages stem from the lack of individualized causation adjudications. California's workers' compensation system, however, sacrificed many of those advantages by allowing individualized courses of treatment based on subjective determinations. In turn, these led to frequent administrative disputes and litigation. 422 This suggests that the proposed environmental compensation system should strictly limit the ability of interested parties to challenge administrative risk determinations. The problems resulting from the deregulation of California's system in the 1990s teach still another lesson. The government must play an active role in determining costs and providin g actuarial information in order to reduce instability in the insurance market. Under this Article's proposal, the government would have to gather a tremendous amount of risk-related information in order to determine appropriate levy and compensation rates. This information should be made publicly available so that insurers can 419. See id . at 10,647 & nn.88-89 (citing Woolf v. Consol. NDE, Inc., 796 A.2d 906, 908, 912 n.1 (N.J. Super. Ct. App. Div. and Corp., 739 P.2d 1073, 1076-77 (Or. Ct. App. 1987)). A defendant might argue in response that a plaintiff's disease was caused by his or her genetic predisposition. See, e.g. , Howard v. Owens Corning, 85 Cal. Rptr. 2d 386, 395, 397 (Ct. App. 1999) (affirming a verdict in favor of the defendant asbestos manufacturer in light of evidence that respiratory illnesses are caused by factors other than asbestos, including genetic predisposition). 420.

HERLICK , 1 CALIFORNIA WORKERS ' COMPENSATION LAW \u00a7 1.19 (6th ed. 2000) (noting that the number of litigated cases filed with the California Workers' Compensation Appeals Board is steadily increasing). Against a backdrop of almost one million work-related injuries per year in California, over 100,000 petitions are filed to commence administrative proceedings and approximately 4000 reach the Appeals Board. Id. 2005] BEYOND TORT 1509 consider it when setting premiums. The government must also use risk data to administer the system. Like Japan's experience with pollution compensation, the workers' compensation experience underscores the financial and political need to set levies on polluters at rates that reflect the social costs imposed by those sources. Comparing the workers' compensation system with the proposal made here reveals a key difference, one that should help the proposed system avoid some difficulties associated with workers' compensation: under the proposal, individuals could use compensation proceeds to purchase insurance from the existing health insurance system. In contrast to workers' compensation, there would be no need for a separate insurance system with its own administrative apparatus and complex rules. Finally, it should be remembered that despite the frequent criticisms of the workers' compensation system, there are no serious proposals to reverse course and return to tort. In short, there seems to be a solid consensus that workers' compensation has been more effective than the tort system at achieving deterrence and compensation goals. 423 D. THE UNITED STATES ' BLACK LUNG PROGRAM Workers' compensation is not the only relevant domestic experience with administrative systems; the Federal Black Lung Program is also instructive. That program's history underscores the need for a well-defined mission and warns that expansionary pressures can undermine the financial viability of an administrative compensation scheme. Congress established the Black Lung Program in 1969 to compensate an estimated 100,000 retired coal miners for certain respiratory diseases associated with exposure to coal dust. 424 The program was the federal government's first direct policy intervention in the field of workers' compensation, which had historically been the domain of the states.425 Under the program, workers were presumed to be disabled if they had worked in a coal mine for at least ten years and had medical evidence of the 423.

During the 1970s, Congress repeatedly broadened the eligibility criteria. Congress added presumptions of eligibility and disability and drastically expanded the class of beneficiaries to include spouses and dependents. 429 These changes significantly increased the program's cost and triggered harsh criticism that led to the program's subsequent redesign. 430 Ultimately, the program's cost discouraged any efforts to have the federal government otherwise play a major role in workers' compensation.431 The controversy surrounding the program largely stems from disagreements concerning its mission.432 Some conceived of it as a way to compensate injured workers. Others viewed it as a means of providing pensions to coal miners, regardless of injury. Still others saw the program as a vehicle for funneling federal money to economically depressed coal mining communities. 433 Because the Black Lung Program had broad, varying purposes that it could only partially fulfill, even its proponents were dissatisfied. Still, the program's failings should not be attributed to administrative compensation schemes in general. A properly designed system can be fiscally sound if the system remains faithful to its goals\u2014internalizing costs, deterring polluters, and compensating victims. 426. W.

POSSIBLE OBJECTIONS TO THE PROPOSAL Parts II through IV of this Article constructed a case that an administrative compensation scheme is possible, feasible, and attractive. Nevertheless, creating an administrative compensation scheme to address environmental toxic injuries will not be technically or politically easy. A number of questions immediately come to mind: Will the tort system also reap the benefits of the technological advances discussed above? Could the tort system be modified to address the problems inherent in environmental toxic injury cases? Why consider the proposed system now, if science and technology are not yet able to support implementing it? How can the necessary information be gathered? How will any associated uncertainty be addressed? Will the proposal's informational needs threaten personal privacy? This part addresses these questions. A. WHY NOT STICK WITH THE TORT SYSTEM ? Environmental toxic tort plaintiffs will likewise benefit from better evidence of general and specific causation.434 For example, enhanced tracking technologies and improved environmental forensic techniques may establish the causal link between an exposure to a harmful substance and the particular source of that substance. These advances may establish that such exposures leave unique gene expression fingerprints on the victim. Even if society had knowledge of every significant health effect of every major pollutant, the tort system would not fully compensate environmental tort plaintiffs. First, tort claims arise only when victims suffer harm. Therefore, problems associ ated with latency, such as insolvent defendants, faded memories, and lost or degraded evidence, will persist. Second, many potential tort plaintiffs will still face significant, even insurmountable, obstacles in proving specific causation. This is due to several factors: epidemiological limitations, difficulties handling probabilistic evidence, and requirements that both general and specific causation be proved by a preponderance of the evidence. As noted earlier, epidemiological studies describe only the excess risk from exposure to a substance; they do not pinpoint the actual source of disease in an individual case. 435 Thus, where an environmental illness may 434. See generally Bergeson et al., supra note 54, at 35-36 (explaining how toxicogenomic data may facilitate establishing causation in toxic tort cases); Marchant, supra note 47, at 10,074-80 (describing the potential implications of toxicogenomics on toxic torts). 435. Rosenberg, supra note 23, at 857; supra Section I.A.2.b. 1512 SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA LAW REVIEW [Vol. 78:1439 be caused by multiple sources, epidemiology cannot demonstrate that exposure to a particular defendant's pollutants was the \"but for\" cause of the illness. 436 For instance, a lung cancer victim may be unable to establish that the illness was caused by exposure to airborne carcinogens rather than smoking. Toxicogenomics offers the potential to identify chemical-specific genetic markers of disease processes. 437 Even with this data, however, specific causation issues will bar recovery if there are multiple potential sources of a disease-causing chemical. This would likely occur in a significant number of cases. Given that regulations ban or limit the use of the most noxious chemicals, many environmental toxic tort injuries will likely involve low-level, long-term exposures to chemicals generated by multiple sources. 438 Furthermore, a greater scientific understanding of causal relationships will not necessarily resolve the difficulties of environmental tort plaintiffs. The probabilistic nature of scientific evidence will hamper recovering in tort. 439 Even if courts become more receptive to probabilistic evidence,440 plaintiffs may be unable to prove causation by a preponderance of the evidence. For example, plaintiffs would be unable to meet their burden whenever the added tortious risk is less than the background cumulative risk attributable to all other factors. 441 Because most low-level exposures to toxic substances do not double the plaintiff's risk,442 many environmental tort victims will continue to be uncompensated, regardless of whether scientific research unearths significant relationships between chemical exposure and harm.443 The doubling of the risk threshold adopted by the tort system is not a necessary or particularly logical one.444 Compensation, 436. See Brennan, supra note 48, at 499 (explaining that the probabilistic evidence provided by toxicology and epidemiology cannot produce mechanisti c causal chains that link individual events to individual injuries); Rosenberg, supra note 23, at 869 (\"The short answer to the demand for 'particularistic' evidence of causation in mass exposure cases is that no such evidence can be produced.\"). 437. Marchant, supra note 47, at 10,078. 438. See supra note 133 and accompanying text. 439. See supra Section I.A.2.c. 440. Courts increasingly have allowed litigants to rely on epidemiological or statistical proof in establishing causation. See Gold, supra note 34, at 377 & n.7. 441. See Rosenberg, supra note 23, at 857-58; supra notes 45-47 and accompanying text. 442. See Marchant, 47, at 10,077. 443. See G ASKINS , supra note 137, at 67 (\"[E]pidemiology over the long term may simply compound our economic ignorance by continuing to discover significant but weak correlations across a growing range of activities. . . . We know just enough to suspect the existence of widespread social costs, but not enough to weave them securely into the market fabric.\"). 444. See supra note 46. 2005] BEYOND TORT 1513 deterrence, and fairness goals all argue for a lower threshold, which the proposed administrative system endorses. Finally, given the widespread exposure to chemical substances, the number of potential tort claims could overburden the courts. This would be particularly true if the tort system were to adopt a lowered compensable risk threshold. As more data on causation becomes available, more tort claims may become viable. 445 These cases will involve complex issues that can be resolved only through extended proceedings involving numerous expert witnesses.446 As discussed in the next section, class actions and other modifications to the tort system would provide only limited relief. B. WHY NOT MODIFY THE TORT SYSTEM ? Commentators have proposed variations of the basic tort action to address the difficulties that environmental toxic tort victims face. These proposals include imposing liability for risk of harm, imposing proportional liability, and certifying class actions. These proposals may improve on the current system, but they will nevertheless fall short in satisfying deterrence, compensation, and corrective justice goals. 1. Liability for Risk of Harm Imposing tort liability on the creation of the risk of harm, rather than on the manifestation of harm, would address some of the latency problems associated with the traditional tort approach. 447 Risk-based liability would take advantage of evidence while it is still fresh.448 In some instances, it 445. See Grodsky, supra note 165, at 267 (predicting, in light of new scientific possibilities, a rise in tort claims if the regulatory system does not account for newly identified health risks). 446. See Rosenberg, supra note 23, at 900. 447. E.g. , Klein, supra note 291, at 1194-96 (proposing that tort claims be allowed based on enhanced risk recovery, but only where toxic exposure has more than doubled the risk of harm); William M. Landes & Richard A. Posner, Tort Law as a Regulatory Regime for Catastrophic Personal Injuries , 13 J. LEGAL STUD. 417, 428-30 (1984) (suggesting that persons be compensated with expected damages when they are exposed to a harmful substance, but that the compensation be adjusted for the probability of suffering those damages); Robinson, supra note 16, at 781-83; Love, supra note 81, at 796 (arguing that recognizing a cause of action for the increased risk of illness from exposure to a toxic substance would overcome various barriers in traditional tort law). Courts have recognized premanifestation claims in the following contexts: invasion of mental well-being based on fear of disease, medical monitoring to detect the onset of a disease, and enhanced risk per se. See Klein, supra note 291, at 1175. Enhanced-risk plaintiffs, however, must generally demonstrate both the existence of some present injury due to the toxic exposure and the likelihood that they will develop the disease for which the exposure has increased their risk . Id. at 1179. 448. Cf. Robinson, supra note 16, at 783-84 (positing that the complexity of assigning causal responsibility is proportional to the elapsed time between the exposure and its causal determination). 1514 SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA LAW REVIEW [Vol. 78:1439 would allow proactive steps to prevent or ameliorate the threatened injury. Furthermore, immediately confronting industry with the full social cost of its activities would promote more effective deterrence. 449 The costs to construct and administer a tort system that addresses risk- based liability, however, may be even greater as a percentage of total costs than are the already high costs of the current tort system. 450 Risk-based claims likely would involve smaller damage awards than those based on harm, while administrative costs may not decrease in proportion. Exposed individuals who face relatively small increased risks and who do not currently manifest physical harm may not bother to file suit. 451 This would be especially true if the expected monetary and psychological costs of litigation exceed the likely modest recovery. To the extent that plaintiffs do make claims based on increased risk, the burdens on the judicial system would increase. 452 2. Proportional Liability Under a proportional liability scheme that used probabilistic causation evidence, plaintiffs would recover in proportion to the probability that they were harmed by the defendant. 453 Proportional liability could apply after Gene expression data is an example of fairly objective evidence of future risk. See Marchant, supra note 47, at 10,079. 449. See Robinson, supra note 16, at 784-85. See also Guido Calabresi, Concerning Cause and the Law of Torts: An Essay for Harry Kalven, Jr. , 43 U. CHI. L. REV. 69, 79 (1975) (\"If specific deterrence were the only goal of tort law, collectively proscribed behavior would be penalized regardless of whether in a specific instance it was a but for cause of harm.\"). 450. See Robinson, supra note 16, at 796-97 (noting the high administrative costs of the tort system and suggesting that the ratio of administrative costs to compensation paid would not change in a risk-based tort compensation system). 451. See Farber, supra note 28, at 1256. In addition, settlements may be more difficult to achieve because of the disagreements over the exact magnitude of liability. See Brinker, supra note 33, at 1320. 452. See John C.P. Goldberg & Benjamin C. Zipursky, Unrealized Torts , 88 V A. L. REV. 1625, 1652-53 (2002); Klein, supra note 291, at 1194 (stating that proportional liability for increased risk \"would allow millions of Americans to bring multiple enhanced risk tort actions\"). 453. Farber, supra note 28, at 1238. See, e.g. , AM. LAW INST., supra note 67, at 369-75 (describing the proposal for proportional recovery where between twenty percent and eighty percent of disease is attributable to particular exposure); Richard Delgado, Beyond Sindell: Relaxation of Cause- in-Fact Rules for Indeterminate Plaintiffs , 70 C AL. L. REV. 881, 899-902 (1982) (proposing a combination of proportionate recovery and burden shifting in \"reverse Sindell \" situations where a defendant has caused less than a fifty-percent increased incidence of harm); John Makdisi, Proportional Liability: A Comprehensive Rule to Apportion Tort Damages Based on Probability , 67 N.C. L. REV. 1063, 1063 (1989) (arguing for replacing causation with a probable causation-in-fact requirement in all tort cases and that damages be allocated in proportion to the probability of causation). 2005] BEYOND TORT 1515 the harm has occurred, or it could be combined with risk-based liability to compensate for decreases in life expectancy.454 A tort system that incorporated proportional liability would be superior to the current tort system in achieving deterrence. In theory, polluters would have an incentive to act with optimal care. Polluters would be required to pay plaintiffs as a class for the full amount of injury caused by the chemicals that they released. 455 In practice, however, proportional liability, like risk-based liability, is likely to be plagued by high transaction costs. For environmental toxic injuries, where risks tend to be diffuse,456 an action based on proportional liability often would not be worth the trouble.457 3. Shifting the Burden of Proving Causation Another possible modification to the tort system would place the burden of disproving causation on defendants.458 This approach would require a plaintiff to establish only: (1) an injury that might be attributed to exposure to a substance generated by the defendant, and (2) inadequate testing or warnings by the defendant.459 At that point, the burden would shift to the defendant to prove either that the injury could not have been caused by exposure to the substance or that it was caused by exposure to another substance.460 Such a scheme would create an incentive for industry to do more research on the health effects of its products and by-products. This burden-shifting, however, might also shift the fundamental bias of the tort system. As one critic noted, \"[E]xposure to any substance would be the basis for liability in a toxic tort case unless the firm that is 454. See Farber, supra note 28, at 1238-39. 455. Id. at 1239; Rosenberg, supra note 23, at 866, 881. 456. See Shavell, supra note 152, at 363, 370. 457. One variant of the proportional liability scheme, known as the most likely victim approach, would pay full damages to the victims who can demonstrate the highest probability that their injuries were caused by the defendant. See Farber, supra note 28, at 1247-48. The advantage of this approach is that it can account for varying degrees of increased risk among those exposed. Thus, it maximizes the odds that the compensation paid by the defendant will go to those individuals whose injuries were actually caused by the defendant. See id. 458. Margaret Berger, for example, has advocated such an approach in the context of product liability cases. See Margaret A. Berger, Eliminating General Causation: Notes Towards a New Theory of Justice and Toxic Torts , 97 C OLUM . L. REV. 2117 (1997). See also Delgado, supra note 453, at 899- 902 (proposing that the burden of causation be reversed and that the defendant be required to prove noncausation in indeterminate plaintiff cases where the plaintiff shows that the defendant has caused a known number of injuries to a class). 459. See Berger, supra note 458, at 2143-44. 460. See id. at 2144-45. 1516 SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA LAW REVIEW [Vol. 78:1439 responsible for the exposure could prove that it engaged in adequate premarket testing.\"461 Unless there was a cap on damage awards,462 overdeterrence might replace underdeterrence, and overcompensation might replace undercompensation.463 4. Class Actions Perhaps the most viable tort alternative would be one that aggregated claims through class actions. Class actions can reduce judicial burdens, increase the efficiency of litigation, and offer a greater overall payoff to the injured. 464 In offering the benefits of cost-spreading and economies of scale, class treatment increases the optimal investment that parties and courts can spend to develop and analyze the merits of a case. 465 But class actions have been sharply criticized. The criticisms include charges that some actions are frivolous, that some enrich attorneys rather than benefit plaintiffs, and that some result in unfair or improper settlements. 466 The incentive problems in class actions may be especially great in cases involving mass tort litigation, considering the multiplicity of parties and the potentially high financial stakes.467 461. Pierce, supra note 35, at 1317. 462. Possible options suggested by Berger for limiting damages include damage scheduling and the release of defendants from liability for pain and suffering. See Berger, supra note 458, at 2145. 463. For defendants who had met the standard of care for developing and disseminating information relevant to risk, Berger's proposal would relieve defendants of liability for injuries caused by exposure to their products. See id. at 2143, 2148. 464. Cf. John B.

See H ENSLER ET AL ., supra note 466, at 6-7. 2005] BEYOND TORT 1517 Environmental injury cases are not well-suited for class action status because such cases involve individuals with varying levels of exposure, severity, and timing, as well as disparate issues of comparative fault or assumption of risk. 468 Of course, the requirements of class action certification can be changed to address some of these concerns. For instance, David Rosenberg has proposed that all potential claims arising out of a particular incident be consolidated into a single class action. 469 Common questions would first be addressed to determine aggregate liability and damages. 470 To take full advantage of the economies of scale, participation would be mandatory. Actions would be predicated on claims of tortious risk, rather than on claims of actual harm.471 Epidemiological data, statistical sampling, modeling, and extrapolation would be used to impose liability for expected aggregate harm, which would promote optimal deterrence.472 Subsequent class litigation could then determine compensation to individual victims, with distributions made according to the relative severity of loss rather than the relative strength of legal claim.473 Rosenberg contends that such a compensation scheme promotes optimal insurance despite sacrificing some corrective justice aims.474 468. As the advisory committee's note to the 1966 Amendment to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(b)(3) explains: A 'mass accident' resulting in injuries to numerous persons is ordinarily not appropriate for a class action because of the likelihood that significant questions, not only of damages but of liability and defenses of liability, would be present, affecting the individuals in different ways. In these circumstances an action conducted nominally as a class action would degenerate in practice into multiple lawsuits separately tried. F ED. R. CIV. P. 23(b)(3) advisory committee's note.

To address the distributional problems posed by mass tort bankruptcies\u2014 where future claimants tend to receive less compensation than existing claimants\u2014Thomas Smith has proposed a \"capital markets\" approach. Under this approach, each successful tort claimant would receive shares in a trust fund instead of damages. See Thomas A. Smith, A Capital Markets Approach to Mass Tort Bankruptcy , 104 Y ALE L.J. 367, 397 (1994). Each share, which would be tradable, would 1518 SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA LAW REVIEW [Vol. 78:1439 Rosenberg's proposal offers deterrence and efficiency benefits over individual tort litigation by avoiding questions of specific causation. Indeed, his proposal resembles the present proposal by predicating liability on risk in collective cases.475 Rosenberg's proposal, however, is better suited for mass torts arising out of a single incident. In those cases, a claimant class has common issues that can be readily defined. 476 For diffuse environmental risks, however, the efficiency benefits are less apparent. There are fewer common issues, and disputes will arise regarding who belongs in the class. Also, low-level polluters will likely escape liability because of the transaction costs involved to litigate a class action claim. 477 C. WHY NOW? One might wonder whether it is premature to consider an administrative alternative to tort, given our limited understanding of toxicity and causation. Although current knowledge and technology are insufficient to permit immediate implementation, there are several reasons to seriously consider this risk-based proposal now. First, enough information exists to begin implementing the scheme for a limited number of substances whose effects are well-documented and whose primary sources can be readily identified. A partial implementation pilot project would be a first step in addressing the undercompensation and underdeterrence that is endemic to toxic injuries. A pilot program would also provide valuable experience to aid designing a more comprehensive system. As discussed above, the EPA's IRIS database and ATSDR's entitle the holder to a fraction of the trust fund at its dissolution date. Share price prior to dissolution would depend on the assessment of the capital markets of the total expected magnitude of liability. See id. at 398-99. 474. See Rosenberg, supra note 465, at 1876. 475. Rosenberg's proposal is essentially a hybrid between traditional tort litigation and an administrative compensation scheme. Mass tort class settlements, such as those arising out of asbestos and silicone breast implant litigation, often involve the creation of a private administrative system that pays compensation according to a preestablished grid. Nagareda, supra note 78, at 751. 476. See Brennan, supra note 3, at 46 (noting that the tort system operates most efficiently with environmental tort cases in which pollution is concentrated and originates from a small number of sources); Fisher, supra note 245, at 156 (discussing the Three Mile Island class action litigation). 477. See Brennan, supra note 48, at 522 & n.269 (contending that class action litigation is likely to be \"an especially unwieldy method\" of compiling a group of victims exposed to air or water pollution). Judging from past experience with mass tort litigation, disputes and delays are likely to characterize even class action claims. See Rabin, Some Thoughts , supra note 15, at 978-79. See also D EWEES ET AL ., supra note 12, at 289 (contending that mandatory class action lawsuits may facilitate the efficient resolution of some lawsuits, but \"seem[] unlikely to bring before the courts many cases that would not otherwise be brought\"). 2005] BEYOND TORT 1519 toxicological profiles offer starting points for identifying substances to be covered.478 These databases suggest the benefits of a centralized effort to collect, analyze, and disseminate scientific research on causation and toxicology.479 Second, an immediate consideration of the proposal would lay the technical groundwork and build institutional capacity for future implementation, even if the proposal is not implemented immediately. The information required by the proposal can be used to prioritize research in toxicogenomics and other fields. 480 Such prioritization is particularly necessary, given the disincentives for private toxicity testing.481 For instance, initial efforts might focus on quantifying with greater precision the health risks attributable to widely distributed pollutants such as nitrogen oxides or sulfur dioxide. 482 Third, and perhaps most important, serious discussion of the proposal now may help to lay the political foundation for implementation.483 The proposal will require many pollution sources to internalize certain costs for the first time. Consideration of th e proposal w ill enable sources to anticipate these costs and search for ways to minimize them through 478. See supra Section III.B.3. 479. See Brennan, supra note 48, at 524 & n.274. 480. This function could be performed through ATSDR, which currently reviews the adequacy of information on the health effects of each hazardous substance on its priority list and identifies future data needs. See 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 9604(i)(5) (2000). 481. See Wendy E. Wagner, Congress, Science, and Environmental Policy , 1999 U. ILL. L. REV. 181, 217 (arguing that the resolution of scientific uncertainties that plague environmental problems may require focused legal attention because the private sector is disinclined to gather this information voluntarily). 482. See, e.g. , A GENCY FOR TOXIC SUBSTANCES & DISEASE REGISTRY , TOXICOLOGICAL PROFILE FOR SULFUR DIOXIDE 97-99 (1998), http://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/toxprofiles/tp116.pdf (noting the lack of data regarding the inhalation risks of intermediate or chronic duration exposures to sulfur dioxide). 483. The proposed regulation of carbon dioxide emissions via emissions trading illustrates how a broad proposal may gain political acceptability over time. When it was first proposed, emissions trading did not receive a favorable response generally or as a solution to global warming. See John J. Fialka, An Environment-Business Global-Warming Link , W ALL ST. J., Nov. 22, 2000, at A2. The mechanism nevertheless became the heart of the Kyoto Protocol\u2014an international treaty for reducing carbon dioxide emissions that took effect in February of 2005. See id. ; Mark Landler, Mixed Feelings as Kyoto Pact Takes Effect , N.Y. TIMES , Feb. 16, 2005, at C1, available at 2005 WLNR 2175085. The United States has declined to join the Kyoto Protocol, and serious questions remain regarding how much credit should be given for investing in projects that absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Some United States companies, however, are now participating in voluntary programs that reduce carbon dioxide emissions in anticipation of the eventual regulation of those emissions. Likewise, United States companies are now trading carbon dioxide credits. See Jeffrey Ball, Knotty Question: If an Oak Eats CO2 in a Forest, Who Gets Emissions Credit? , W ALL ST. J., Dec. 10, 2003, at A1; Barnaby J. Feder, Some Businesses Take Initiative to Voluntarily Reduce Emissions , N.Y.

Furthermore, adoption of the proposal may be politically easier when interested parties face a veil of ignorance\u2014because of scientific uncertainty, the relative burdens of the program within any industry are relatively undetermined. If the chemicals that polluters release are fairly benign, as industry sometimes asserts, then polluters should be willing to accept a system that internalizes health costs when health effects are better understood. On the other hand, if the chemicals turn out not to be benign, polluters may benefit from a system that could reduce their exposure to uncertain and potentially sizeable judgments. In the meantime, the proposal can serve as a basis for criticizing and improving the current system by establishing a normative framework for regulation. At present, it is generally accepted that environmental tort victims have no recourse when their illnesses are due to \"general\" air pollution. The administrative compensation system proposed here underscores the tort system's inadequacy in dealing with injuries arising from exposure to commonly released substances. D. WILL WE HAVE THE NECESSARY DATA? As Part II stressed, the proposed system presumes the existence of significant quantities of data regarding exposure and associated health risks. This section explores whether su fficient incentives exist to generate this data and whether the resulting data will be of adequate quality. 1. Incentives Risk-based liability proposals have been criticized for creating insufficient incentives to fund and perform scientific research on potentially toxic chemicals. 484 For obvious reasons, investment in environmental and health effects tends to lag behind investment in research that increases the value of private goods.485 Indeed, rational-choice theory 484. See, e.g. , Leslie, supra note 38, at 1851. Melanie Leslie has expressed concern that research efforts would be stymied if even a slight increase in risk would trigger liability. Id. Such concerns can be ameliorated, however, by setting a minimum threshold for risk, below which there would be no liability. 485. See Carol M. Rose, Scientific Innovation and Environmental Protection: Some Ethical Considerations , 32 E NVTL . L. 755, 761-63, 763 n.33 (2002) (discussing examples of PCBs, dichloro- diphenyl-trichloroethane, and chlorofluorocarbons, all of which gained widespread use prior to research discovering their detrimental effects on human health and the environment). See also Golanski, supra note 47, at 500-01 (\"Whereas levels of research about commercial products and their components may be directly sensitive to the manufacturer's particularized corporate interests, research into medical conditions and causal factors ordinarily flows from a different and more diffuse political dynamic that exists within the medical and scientific communities.\"). 2005] BEYOND TORT 1521 predicts that if polluters are going to invest in research at all, they will dedicate resources to producing exculpatory evidence and concealing and contesting incriminating information. 486 Although tort liability theoretically creates incentives to learn about potential harms, the specter of liability is often too remote to motivate research.487 Nevertheless, as society develops more information on the toxicity of common pollutants, the administrative system proposed here will become an increasingly attractive alternative to the tort system. The prospect of avoiding future tort litigation creates some incentive to perform research. The attendant and unpredictable risks of substantial tort judgments also create an incentive for pollution injuries to be resolved within the proposed administrative system.488 This would particularly be the case with substances for which there is growing evidence of toxicity that has not yet risen to the level of firm proof. In these cases, a polluter faces a significant but not readily predictable risk of potential tort liability. The risk of punitive damages exists as well, which might become excessive if imposed in multiple cases. 489 For polluters, an administrative compensation scheme could serve as a form of pollution liability insurance\u2014a type of insurance that has otherwise become unavailable because of the uncertainty surrounding liability. 490 Admittedly, the fear of tort liability will not create a sufficient incentive for research in all cases in 486. See Wendy E. Wagner, Commons Ignorance: The Failure of Environmental Law to Produce Needed Information on Health and the Environment , 53 D UKE L.J. 1619, 1622, 1631-59 (2004). 487.

See Huber, supra note 17, at 146. 1522 SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA LAW REVIEW [Vol. 78:1439 which it is warranted. Government intervention and funding would likely be necessary to set priorities and fill gaps in remaining research.491 The risks of liability for polluters are nonetheless quite real, as two examples suggest. First, the litigation brought by the states in the 1990s against the tobacco industry resulted in settlements worth an estimated $240 billion.492 The underlying theories of legal liability included claims for reimbursement of tobacco-related health care costs, fraud, and conspiracy.493 Even though many of these theories have been described as \"implausible,\" the tobacco industry apparently concluded that its litigation risks were significant. 494 It would not require a considerable stretch of the imagination to apply analogous theories to pollution. Indeed, in the second example, eight states and New York City recently sued five utility companies under a public nuisance theory. 495 The plaintiffs sued to compel reductions in carbon dioxide emissions contributing to global warming.496 Although the suit seeks no damages and has yet to be resolved,497 it foreshadows the claims that polluters may someday face.498 2. Information Quality Considerable costs will be involved in producing the research necessary to support the proposed system. Nevertheless, whatever data does become available will be associated with some uncertainty. 499 As the Supreme Court has stated, \"Scientific conclusions are subject to perpetual 491. Cf.

New scientific techniques will rapidly and economically yield much of the desired information. 503 Research into the effects of exposure to chemical substances is likely to be done anyway, at least for common pollutants. The adoption of a regulatory administrative system would simply channel that research. Nevertheless, any resulting data will inevitably be subject to some uncertainty. 504 Confidence intervals for probable effects may be sizable,505 and statistical calculations will require reasonable assumptions.506 This 500.

As Japan's experience suggests, in order to be scientifically and politically credible, a system merely requires information that can serve as a reasonable basis for assessing individual polluters and for making fair distributions to victims. 507 What distinguishes the present situation from the Japanese experience is that technology and scientific knowledge have now advanced sufficiently to provide the necessary informational foundation for the proposed system. Advances in toxicogenomics and biomonitoring are enhancing the ability of epidemiological studies and like enterprises to detect and measure potential toxic effects. Today, researchers can monitor and model human exposure in microenvironments. In the future, researchers will be able to do so with even greater precision and detail, and at less cost. We no longer need to extrapolate monitoring data from wide areas and risk results that provide only rough estimates of exposure. 508 Such rapid technological advances are occurring not only in the collection of data, but also in its analysis. Enhanced computing power will more readily allow scientists to identify causal relationships and to disentangle synergistic effects.509 Technological advances will not eliminate the need for simplifying assumptions regarding baseline risks, exposures, and other variables. But those assumptions would not be unique to the regulatory realm. With enhanced analytic power, the assumptions used to support an administrative system can be more refined than those that have been routinely used to set safety requirements or to determine pollution control and cleanup standards. 510 Of course, judgment will still million to $1.2 billion). The size of confidence intervals can be reduced by increasing the sample size in a study or by decreasing the degree of confidence demanded of the data. See Brennan, supra note 48, at 510-11. 507.

For instance, one might reasonably assume that, in the absence of contrary evidence, the dose-response curve\u2014the relationship between the exposure to a toxic substance and its effect on an individual\u2014is linear. See Sunstein, supra note 506, at 2280, 2290-91 (noting the common assumption that genotoxic carcinogens exhibit linear dose-response curves). 508. Such extrapolations can result in crude estimates because of the high variability in pollution concentrations. See Hertel et al., supra note 199, at 952. 509. See Esty, supra note 4, at 158-59. 510.

OTHER ISSUES 1. Behavioral Incentives A scheme that compensates for pollution exposure could result in various moral hazards. For instance, making compensation available to exposed persons regardless of their behavior arguably reduces the incentive for individuals to take protective or risk-reducing measures. 513 But because environmental toxic injury generally involves the unilateral imposition of risk of injury on others,514 the most effective risk-reducing measures are likely to be within the polluter's control. Indeed, the proposed scheme is unlikely to discourage a victim's risk-reducing behavior, as compensation is generally determined independently of changes in daily behavior, such as using an air purifier. Changes in place of residence or employment will affect compensation paid under the system. 515 It is unlikely, however, that individuals\u2014even risk-loving ones\u2014will move closer to major pollution sources if compensation can be applied only toward insurance, medical to environmental exposures. But the problem of a lack of usable data may soon be resolved by a growing scientific understanding in that area. Id. 511. Cf. Holly Doremus, Constitutive Law and Environmental Policy , 22 S TAN. ENVTL . L.J. 295, 331-32 (2003) (contending that environmental problems cannot be solved objectively because they are indeterminate in nature and involve conflicts over values); Doremus, supra note 504, at 1065 (\"[S]imply characterizing a question as scientific does not guarantee an answer which is either objective or reliable.\"); Wendy E.

PROBS ., Autumn 2003, at 63, 64-65 (noting that because \"risk assessments combine scientific knowledge (for example, toxicity tests on animals) with science-policy judgments (for example, dose-response assumptions), . . . most decisions in public health and environmental regulation break down into a series of sub-decisions that alternate or zigzag between science and science-policy\") (internal footnote omitted)). 512. Brennan presented a more detailed proposal for a similar federal hazardous substance science panel. Brennan's proposed panel would develop policies regarding hazardous substance injuries, review statistical and epidemiological evidence of injuries caused by hazardous substances, and establish guidelines for exposure to hazardous substances. See Brennan, supra note 48, at 525-28. 513. See, e.g. , D EWEES ET AL ., supra note 12, at 267 (suggesting that victims who are fully compensated lack the incentive to mitigate damages or to engage in less sensitive activities). 514. See supra note 87 and accompanying text. 515. Cf. DEWEES ET AL ., supra note 12, at 267 (noting that if victims are fully compensated, \"there is theoretically nothing to deter sensitive victims from moving close to a source of pollution because they will be made whole for any losses that they suffer\"). 1526 SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA LAW REVIEW [Vol. 78:1439 expenses, and the like. In addition, because compensation will be based on risk rather than actual injury, absolute differences in compensation may not be sufficient to prompt relocation to receive greater compensation. Such differences can nevertheless perform an important signaling function. Individuals who are particularly vulnerable or sensitive can use such information to relocate and thus reduce their exposure and health risks. 516 For polluters, the system will magnify incentives to locate in sparsely populated areas, thereby reducing pollution costs. Ideally, society would internalize all pollution costs, including decreased agricultural productivity and damage to property, animals, and the environment. 517 Full cost internalization, however, is even less likely than the adoption of the present proposal. To protect against undesirable impacts on the environment, direct regulation will be necessary. Baseline pollution standards, zoning laws, anti-sprawl legislation, and similar measures will be required. 2. Privacy Extensive monitoring of the environment and of individual health can raise serious concerns about privacy. 518 In designing a government administered compensation system, one should heed these concerns. To some extent, models can substitute for environmental monitoring. Such models, however, should be verified by comparing predictions with real world data. For example, rather than monitoring chemical levels in all individuals, researchers could conduct biomonitoring of a few volunteers to verify estimated levels of exposure and intake. Other simplifying assumptions may also be necessary to protect privacy. For example, although one could use GPS technology to track the specific location of individuals in order to estimate exposure, reasonable exposure estimates based on home and work addresses would be far less intrusive. 516. Toxicogenetics is increasingly able to provide individuals with information regarding their unique susceptibility to particular risks. See Marchant, supra note 45, at 10,663. Information may be disclosed by the administrative system, either directly through publishing the underlying data or indirectly through compensation payments. That information can also be used by communities and other stakeholders to put pressure on firms to better manage environmental risk. See Cohen, supra note 120, at 10,426. 517. See D EWEES ET AL ., supra at 265-66. 518. See, e.g. , Wanjek, supra note 174, at F1 (noting the concern that biomonitoring data could be used for discriminatory purposes by insurance companies or employers); Lidia Wasowicz, In Sensors Smaller May Be Smarter , UNITED PRESS INT'L, July 14, 2003, http://www.upi.com/view.cfm?StoryID= 20030714-112803-3242r (mentioning privacy and security concerns with respect to the use of \"smart dust\").

Autonomy To some, the tort system represents an opportunity for victims to have their day in court. Under this rationale, the tort system facilitates individual autonomy. In contrast to an administrative system, the tort system might be thought to promote fairer outcomes because it adjudicates cases individually based on their specific facts. 519 In particular, the tort system adjusts damages to account for individualized circumstances of pain, suffering, and economic hardship. The proposed administrative compensation system, like class action tort cases, compromises the benefits of individualized adjudications in order to gain efficiency.520 With respect to environmental tort injuries, however, the benefits of tort are of little practical value\u2014few individual cases are brought successfully in tort. For those few plaintiffs who do bring cases, most do not receive their day in court, let alone individualized justice in any meaningful sense. Cases tend to be settled rather than tried, and settlements tend to follow standardized valuation criteria that reflect average outcomes from similar cases. 521 The proposal does not provide victims with a literal day in court, but it does acknowledge the real risks and injuries borne by victims exposed to environmental pollutants. VI. CONCLUSION The tort system has largely overlooked the problem of environmental toxic injury, despite mounting evidence that exposure to common pollutants causes significant numbers of fatalities and serious illnesses. In the future, scientific research will continue to generate even more evidence of low-level but significant risks. The tort system, however, is unlikely to correct its failure to compensate injured environmental tort plaintiffs. It is unlikely that the tort system will one day help internalize the costs to human health of these environmental toxic injuries. The administrative 519.

Nevertheless, this proposed risk-based system offers a more effective approach. It can provide the proper signals for efficient deterrence. It can enable victims to respond to or mitigate risks. And it can promote corrective justice. To achieve these ends, this proposal capitalizes on technological advances and growing scientific knowledge. These advances present an important new opportunity. We should seize it. "}
