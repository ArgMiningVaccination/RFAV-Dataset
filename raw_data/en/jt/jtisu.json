A well-balanced diet, healthy lifestyle, and oral supplements play an important role in ensuring that your body performs optimally. IV Therapy Health Benefits Intravenous (IV) vitamin treatments are effective in fighting against flu and cold symptoms. They are an important defense against viruses and infections. The treatments can boost your immune system by delivering the required antioxidants and vitamins to the cells directly. IV therapy can deliver minerals, vitamins, and antioxidants into the bloodstream directly. Intravenous treatments effectively bypass the digestive system to allow your body to fully absorb the nutrients. The therapy, at the same time, detoxifies the body naturally. It removes harmful free radicals that may contribute to impaired immune function and toxin build-up. Immune-supporting IV therapy is particularly effective when administered every 3 - 4 months on a regular basis. The body is damaged by free radicals at a cellular level.

Your treatment provider will carefully select ingredients required by your body to maintain a healthy gut, provide nutritional bioavailability to cells, and process toxins quicker. It's critical to understand that IV therapy alone will not prevent you from falling sick or getting a cold. However, it will minimize the likelihood of you falling prey to pathogens.
