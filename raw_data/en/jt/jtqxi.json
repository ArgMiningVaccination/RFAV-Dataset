Despite vaccines and mAbs against SUDs demonstrating proof of efficacy, selectivity, and safety in animal models, it is unknown whether the mechanism of action of these immunotherapeutics relies exclusively on the formation of Ab/drug complexes, or also involves Ab-mediated effector functions. Hence, this study tested whether the efficacy of active and passive immunization against drugs of abuse requires phagocytosis, the intact Fc portion of the anti-drug Ab, FcRs, or the neonatal FcR (FcRn). The efficacy of a lead vaccine against oxycodone was not diminished in mice after depletion of macrophages or granulocytes. Anti-oxycodone F(ab)2 fragments resulted in lower serum levels of F(ab)2 compared with intact mAbs, and F(ab)2s were not as effective as the parent mAbs in reducing distribution of oxycodone to the brain. The efficacy of vaccines and mAbs against oxycodone was preserved in either FcIII or FcI-IV ablated mice, suggesting that FcRs are not required for Ab efficacy. Finally, both active and passive immunization against oxycodone in FcRn/ mice yielded reduced efficacy compared with wild-type control mice. These data identified a role for FcRn, but not for phagocytosis or Fc-dependent effector functions, in mediating the efficacy of vaccines and mAbs against SUD. This study supports rational design of vaccines and mAbs engineered for maximal neutralization activity and optimal FcRn binding. This article is featured in Top Reads, p.751 Introduction Substance abuse disorders (SUDs) and drug-related overdoses are a worldwide public health threat, and they have a dramatic economic impact due to crime and lost productivity ( [1](javascript:;)). In the United States, opioid use disorders (OUDs) and fatal overdoses related to opioids have reached epidemic proportions ( [2](javascript:;)). Since the 1990s and early 2000s, OUD has spiked partly due to over-prescription of opioid analgesics such as oxycodone and hydrocodone, which often act as gateway drugs to heroin i.v. use ( [3](javascript:;)). More recently, widespread access to illicit fentanyl and its analogs has exacerbated the incidence of accidental overdoses from exposure to street mixtures containing opioids or psychostimulants laced with fentanyl ( [4](javascript:;)). Finally, during the COVID-19 pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 novel coronavirus, the incidence of opioid fatal and non-fatal overdoses increased in the United States ( [5](javascript:;)). Available treatments, consisting of pharmacological agonists and antagonists of the \u00b5-opioid receptor, have not been sufficient to prevent the occurrence of OUD and fatal overdose, highlighting the need for new medical interventions in this area. Therapeutic or prophylactic use of vaccines and mAbs may offer a complementary strategy against SUDs, OUDs, and related overdoses. Vaccines and mAbs have demonstrated efficacy, selectivity, and safety in animal models involving drug-induced antinociception, locomotor activity, respiratory depression, bradycardia, lethality, and opioid self-administration in preclinical models ( [6](javascript:;)- [12](javascript:;)). Vaccine-induced polyclonal Abs and mAbs act by selectively binding the target drug, forming Ab/drug complexes that retain drugs in serum or extracellular fluids, thus preventing opioids from crossing the blood-brain barrier and reducing opioid-induced pharmacological effects (reviewed in Refs. [11](javascript:;) and [12](javascript:;)). Vaccine-induced Abs targeting small molecules such as nicotine have also been shown to reduce drug distribution to tissues including muscle, spleen, liver, heart, kidney, and adipose compartment ( [13](javascript:;)). Additionally, the Ab/opioid complex is not active at the \u00b5-opioid receptor in vitro ( [10](javascript:;)), which limits concerns for secondary effects at peripheral receptors. To date, it is not known whether the mechanism of action of these immunotherapeutics relies exclusively on Ab/drug complexes reducing the concentration of unbound (free) drug in circulation, or whether active processes including Ab-mediated effector functions are involved. Although the role of Ab effector functions is well established for Ab-mediated pathogen clearance ( [14](javascript:;), [15](javascript:;)), their contribution to vaccine efficacy against drugs of abuse or other small molecules is less clear. A recent study found that IgG specific for small molecule neuromuscular-blocking agents used in anesthesia triggered anaphylaxis in human patients, correlated with markers of FcR and neutrophil activation ( [16](javascript:;)). These data highlight the importance of studying effector functions associated with beneficial or detrimental effects on vaccine or mAb efficacy. As vaccines and mAbs against SUDs move into the clinical space, such studies will provide additional evidence of safety. Abs consist of a Fab, which is sufficient for Ag binding and neutralization, and the Fc region, which is required for functions including phagocytosis, cytotoxic killing, and complement activation, enabled by binding to FcR and complement ( [17](javascript:;), [18](javascript:;)). Additionally, Fc FcR (FcRn) acts to increase Ab half-life through a cellular recycling mechanism, in which the endocytosed Ab is rescued from degradation and returned to circulation ( [19](javascript:;), [20](javascript:;)). To evaluate the contribution of Ab-dependent Fc receptor mechanisms for anti-opioid vaccines, this study tested whether the efficacy of active and passive immunization against oxycodone requires only neutralization, or also incorporates other downstream mechanisms involving Fc-mediated interactions. Anti-drug conjugate vaccines stimulate T cell-dependent B cell activation and germinal center formation to generate target-specific Abs ( [11](javascript:;)). While several cellular and molecular targets are involved in this process, our laboratory has found that vaccine efficacy against opioids in mice is impacted by IL-4 signaling ( [21](javascript:;), [22](javascript:;)). Specifically, blockade of IL-4 increased vaccine efficacy against oxycodone and fentanyl, which correlated with increased levels of IgG1, IgG2a, and IgG3 subclasses compared with control. Immunization of IL-4 receptor/ and STAT6/ mice showed an increase in IgG2a and IgG3 levels alone, without an associated change in IgG1 levels, but it did not increase vaccine efficacy against oxycodone. Increased efficacy associated with higher levels of IgG1, IgG2a, and IgG3 subclasses has also been reported for formulations against nicotine ( [23](javascript:;)) and cocaine ( [24](javascript:;)). Although activation of IgG subclasses may be related to simply more mature class switch events in B cells, these preliminary studies also suggested the possibility that differential binding of IgG subclasses to Fc receptors may be important for efficacy. Understanding whether neutralization only, or instead Fc-mediated clearance, is the main underlying mechanism of action of Abs against drugs of abuse will inform development of more effective vaccine formulations and mAb engineering. When Fc-mediated effector functions are involved, efforts should be focused on characterization of the role of IgG isotypes and Fc glycosylation, two major factors that affect Fc receptor binding. When FcRn-mediated Ab recycling is involved, efforts should be focused on engineering mAbs to display Fc sequences to optimize FcRn binding and recycling ( [25](javascript:;), [26](javascript:;)), which would increase or maintain functional Ab levels in vivo. Hence, this study compared the efficacy of anti-oxycodone F(ab)2 fragments to the parent mAbs, and sought to determine whether the efficacy of vaccines and mAbs against opioids would be reduced by pharmacological inhibition of or by genetic ablation of FcIII, FcI-IV, or FcRn in mice. These data identified a role for FcRn, but not for phagocytosis or Fc-dependent effector functions, in mediating efficacy of vaccines and mAbs against SUD or OUD. These data suggest that opioid/Ab complexes are not likely to trigger FcR-related side effects in immunized subjects, minimizing concerns for immune-related adverse events following anti-opioid active or passive immunization. Additionally, this study supports rational design of vaccines and mAbs engineered for maximal neutralization activity and optimal FcRn binding. Materials and Methods Animals All studies were approved by the Hennepin Healthcare Research Institute (HHRI) and the University of Minnesota Animal Care and Use Committees. Male BALB/c mice were purchased from Envigo (Indianapolis, IN), and male C57BL/6, FcRIII/, and FcRn/ mice were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME). Female and male FcRI-IV/ mice ( [27](javascript:;), [28](javascript:;)) were a gift from Dr. Sjef Verbeek (Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, the Netherlands). Experiments were conducted on 6- to 10-wk-old mice, with the exception of experiments using FcRI-IV/ mice aged 15-20 wk obtained from an in-house breeding program. Mice were group housed in conventional environment with a 14-h light/10-h dark cycle (light cycle 6:00 am to 8:00 pm) and fed ad libitum. Vaccine and mAb formulations An oxycodone-based hapten containing a purified by filtration (Amicon, MilliporeSigma, Burlington, MA) and characterized as described ( [29](javascript:;)). Vaccine formulations included 75 \u00b5g of adsorbed on aluminum adjuvant InvivoGen, San Diego, CA) in sterile to injection. An anti-oxycodone mAb (clone HY1-3G8) as described ( [31](javascript:;)). F(ab)2 fragments were generated from the parent mAbs by enzymatic digestion with agarose-immobilized ficin (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) with 4 mM cysteine, and purified with protein A-agarose to remove Fc fragments and undigested IgG. The mAbs and F(ab)2 were prepared in sterile saline. Active and passive immunizations Mice were immunized i.m. on days 0, 14, and 28 (unless otherwise specified) with either unconjugated carrier protein (KLH or sKLH) or vaccine (OXY-KLH or OXY-sKLH) in a total injection volume of 60 \u00b5l via two injections into contralateral caudal thigh muscles. As detailed in specific experiments, mice were immunized with either OXY-KLH or OXY-sKLH concurrently with a neutralizing anti-IL-4 mAb Ab (clone 11B11, Bio X Cell, West Lebanon, NH) on days 2 and +1 of the vaccination series (0.5 mg/200 \u00b5l i.p.) as described previously ( studies, anti-oxycodone mAbs or F(ab)2 fragments were delivered i.p. 24 h prior to the oxycodone challenge. Macrophage poisoning and granulocyte depletion Immunized mice were administered i.v. 1 mg of lipid vesicles encapsulating clodronate (Liposoma, Amsterdam, the Netherlands) 12 h prior to oxycodone challenge. Mice were administered i.p. with 0.5 mg of anti-granulocyte receptor-1 (Gr-1) Ab (clone RB6-BC5, a gift from Dr. Thomas Griffith, University of Minnesota Center for Immunology) 12 h and 2 h prior to the oxycodone challenge. Both reagents were administered in sterile PBS in a total volume of 200 \u00b5l. To verify successful treatment of macrophage and granulocyte populations, spleen and lymph nodes were collected at the conclusion of the experiment and analyzed by flow cytometry ( [Supplemental titers and subclasses were analyzed indirect ELISA as previously described ( [8](javascript:;)). Briefly, 96-well plates were coated with 5 ng/well of either OXY-OVA conjugates or unconjugated OVA control in carbonate buffer at pH 9.6 and blocked with 1% gelatin. Serum was added at an initial dilution of 1:200. Primary Abs were incubated with of oxycodone-specific mAb or F(ab)2 were analyzed with indirect ELISA using a secondary Ab specific to mouse IgG1 (Alpha Diagnostics International, catalog no. 40126) or F(ab)2 (MilliporeSigma, catalog no. SAB3700993-2MG). Vaccine, oxycodone in vivo mAb, and F(ab)2 efficacy was tested against oxycodone-induced antinociception on a 54\u00b0C hot plate, a test of centrally mediated analgesia commonly used to screen for vaccine potency in blocking opioid pharmacological effects. Behavioral tests were performed during the light cycle, between 10 am and 2 pm. Latency to respond was measured as time to first hindpaw flick or lift, observed by an experimenter blinded to treatment condition, and was measured at baseline and 15 or 30 min after oxycodone administration. Maximum possible effect (MPE) was calculated = [(post-drug allowable was 60 s. After oxycodone challenge, mice were euthanized to collect serum and brain for measurement of oxycodone concentrations by either gas chromatography/mass spectrometry chromatography/mass spectrometry [32](javascript:;)). Briefly, brains were weighed and homogenized in four parts 0.1 M phosphate buffer (pH 6.0), and serum and brain homogenate samples were extracted with Bond Elut Plexa PCX 3-ml extraction cartridges (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA), and analyzed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry with a Zorbax Eclipse Plus C18 column (Agilent) and G6470A TQ (Agilent). Statistical analyses Data are expressed as means \u00b1 SEM. All experiments were performed once with n 3 per group. Between-group comparisons were determined by one-way ANOVA paired with a Tukey's multiple comparison post hoc test. Any p values < 0.05 were accepted as significant. All analyses were made using Prism 8.3.0 (GraphPad, La Jolla, CA). Results Monocytes, macrophages, and granulocytes are not required for vaccine efficacy against oxycodone Because it is unknown whether IgG-induced phagocytosis is involved in the mechanism of action of anti-drug polyclonal Abs or mAbs, we tested whether the major cell subsets that perform this Ab-dependent effector function contributes to vaccine efficacy against oxycodone in mice. Because macrophages and granulocytes constitute most circulating phagocytic cells ( [33](javascript:;)), these cell populations were depleted by treatment with liposome-embedded clodronate or anti-Gr-1 mAbs, respectively. BALB/c mice KLH or OXY-KLH, and either clodronate or anti-Gr-1 treatment was administered within 12 h prior to the oxycodone challenge. To verify successful vaccination, oxycodone-specific serum IgG Ab titers were analyzed 24 h prior to the drug challenge ( [Fig. 1A](javascript:;)). Absence of macrophages (F4/80+) and granulocytes (Gr-1+) was confirmed by flow cytometry in spleen and lymph nodes ( [Supplemental Fig. 1](/jimmunol/article-supplement/234239/pdf/ji_2100204_supplemental_1/)). After drug challenge, serum oxycodone concentration was increased in immunized groups compared with control group immunized with unconjugated ( anti-Gr-1-treated mice reduced the brain-to-serum ratio of oxycodone concentrations compared with KLH controls ( [Fig. 1C](javascript:;)), and no statistically significant differences were found between vaccinated groups after clodronate or anti-Gr-1 treatment. These data suggested that macrophages or Gr-1+ cells are not necessary for vaccine efficacy against acute oxycodone challenge. [Close modal](javascript:;) F(ab)2 fragments are not as effective as intact mAb against acute opioid challenge Next, we tested whether Fc-mediated effector functions are involved in the efficacy of vaccines against oxycodone. To this end, the functional Fc fragment of oxycodone-specific mAb was F(ab)2. Compared to mAbs, F(ab)2 fragments retain the capacity for Ag binding and neutralization by formation of opioid/Ab complexes, but not Fc receptor binding. Mice were passively immunized with either anti-oxycodone mAb or the molar equivalent dose of the oxycodone-specific F(ab)2. Although no observable differences in the hot plate test of antinociception were detected ( [Supplemental Fig. 2A](/jimmunol/article-supplement/234239/pdf/ji_2100204_supplemental_1/)), after a 2.25 mg/kg oxycodone challenge, serum oxycodone concentrations were significantly increased in both mAb- and F(ab)2-immunized mice compared with control mice ( [Fig. 2A](javascript:;)). However, mAb was serum oxycodone ( [Fig. 2A](javascript:;)), which was associated with a greater reduction in the brain-to-serum ratio in mAb-treated mice ( [Fig. 2B](javascript:;)). To further characterize the reduced efficacy of F(ab)2 compared with intact mAb, a dose-response study tested whether higher doses of F(ab)2 fragments could recapitulate the effect of mAbs. In this experiment, mice were passively immunized with 40 mg/kg anti-oxycodone mAb, F(ab)2 fragments at a [Fig. 2C](javascript:;)) were assessed by ELISA at 2 h prior to the drug challenge. Whereas increasing doses of F(ab)2 yielded higher titers, serum levels did not equal those of the mAb. When mice were challenged with 2.0 mg/kg oxycodone, higher F(ab)2 dosing resulted in a trend toward higher retention of oxycodone in the serum compartment, but serum oxycodone concentrations did not match those of mAb-treated mice ( [Fig. 2D](javascript:;)). However, mice receiving a dose of 40 mg/kg or higher of F(ab)2 fragments displayed significantly reduced brain-to-serum ratios compared with control ( [Fig. 2E](javascript:;)). These data demonstrate that higher doses of F(ab)2 could be potentially deployed to protect from oxycodone, although the intact mAb demonstrated higher efficacy at lower doses. The serum titer of F(ab)2 and IgG before challenge showed a significant negative correlation with brain oxycodone concentrations ( [Fig. 2F](javascript:;)), supporting that doses of F(ab)2 sufficient to match serum IgG concentrations could reach similar efficacy to intact IgG. Discrepancies in mAb or F(ab)2 efficacy against oxycodone may be explained by altered tissue distribution of F(ab)2 or opioid/F(ab)2 complexes, and a longer OUDs should retain an Fc for optimal duration of action. [Close modal](javascript:;) FcRIII is not required for generation of effective anti-oxycodone polyclonal Ab responses Activation of FcRIII can mediate inflammatory processes, including phagocytosis, cytokine production, and Ab-dependent cellular cytotoxicity ( [36](javascript:;), [37](javascript:;)). tested of by immunizing C57BL/6 wild-type and FcRIII/ mice with OXY-KLH in the presence of a neutralizing mAb against IL-4 (anti-IL-4), which has been shown to enhance total IgG, IgG2, and IgG3 titers, and increase vaccine efficacy against opioids ( [21](javascript:;)). Seven days after completion of the third immunization, mice were challenged with 2.5 mg/kg oxycodone and assessed for oxycodone-induced antinociception in the hot plate test. In this first challenge, there was no distinguishable difference between OXY-KLH immunized mice and KLH control immunized mice ( [Supplemental Fig. 2B](/jimmunol/article-supplement/234239/pdf/ji_2100204_supplemental_1/)). Therefore, mice were vaccinated a fourth time 14 d after the last immunization, and presented with a second oxycodone challenge consisting of two sequential 2.5 mg/kg doses at 15-min intervals, for a cumulative h prior to drug challenge ( [Fig. 3A](javascript:;)). There were no significant differences between immunized groups in vaccine-induced titers, and immunized mice in both wild-type and FcRIII/ groups demonstrated reduced antinociception compared with KLH controls, with a trend toward a greater reduction in FcRIII/ mice ( [Fig. 3B](javascript:;)). OXY-KLH, serum oxycodone levels significantly compared with control mice ( [Fig. 3C](javascript:;)), and brain-to-serum ratios of oxycodone concentration were reduced in groups immunized with the active vaccine ( [Fig. 3D](javascript:;)). These data show that FcRIII is not necessary for the induction of anti-oxycodone polyclonal Abs, nor critical for efficacy in blocking oxycodone distribution to the brain during acute drug challenges. [Close modal](javascript:;) FcRI-IV are not necessary for generation of polyclonal Abs or for vaccine efficacy against oxycodone Fc receptors I, II, III, and IV play a role in cell signaling activation and inhibition, binding to IgG subclasses with varying affinities ( [17](javascript:;), [36](javascript:;), [37](javascript:;)). To investigate the role of these receptors in reducing oxycodone distribution to the brain, we immunized male and female wild-type and FcRI-IV/ and subclasses were assessed within 24 h prior to the drug challenge. There was no difference in total oxycodone-specific IgG Abs or in IgG subclasses in OXY-sKLH ( [Fig. 4A](javascript:;)), except for a small but statistically significant reduction in IgG3 titers in female FcRI-IV/ mice compared with female wild-type mice ( [Supplemental Fig. 3B](/jimmunol/article-supplement/234239/pdf/ji_2100204_supplemental_1/)). Thirty minutes after a 5.0 mg/kg oxycodone challenge, serum oxycodone levels were increased in both male and female OXY-KLH immunized mice, and there were no significant differences in serum oxycodone concentrations between wild-type or FcRI-IV/ mice ( [Fig. 4B](javascript:;)). Similarly, both male and female mice receiving OXY-KLH demonstrated a significant reduction in the oxycodone brain-to-serum ratio compared with KLH control mice ( [Fig. 4C](javascript:;)). Additionally, no statistically significant differences were seen between immunized wild-type and FcRI-IV/ mice with male and female mice analyzed separately ( [Supplemental Fig. 3E](/jimmunol/article-supplement/234239/pdf/ji_2100204_supplemental_1/), [3F](/jimmunol/article-supplement/234239/pdf/ji_2100204_supplemental_1/)). To distinguish between the effects of FcRs on development of Ab over time and acute effects during drug challenge, an independent passive immunization study was conducted with anti-oxycodone mAb in male wild-type and FcRI-IV/ mice. Similar to active immunization, treatment with mAb resulted in similar serum oxycodone levels in wild-type FcRI-IV/ mice 30 min after a 5.0 mg/kg oxycodone challenge. These studies support that the FcRI-IV are not necessary to mediate vaccine or mAb efficacy against the target drug. [Close modal](javascript:;) FcRn is necessary for generation of anti-drug polyclonal Abs as well as efficacy of vaccines and mAbs against oxycodone FcRn is widely known for its role in recycling Abs and contributing to Ab half-life. To test for the role of FcRn in mediating vaccine efficacy against opioids, we immunized FcRn/ mice with OXY-KLH. FcRn/ mice developed oxycodone-specific Abs at significantly lower wild-type mice [Fig. 5A](javascript:;)). 5B](javascript:;)) compared with controls. However, both wild-type and FcRn/ immunized mice demonstrated a reduced brain-to-serum ratio in oxycodone concentration compared with their respective KLH controls ( [Fig. 5C](javascript:;)), but the reduction was significantly larger in wild-type immunized mice compared with FcRn/ mice. As a control study to account for the reduced anti-oxycodone Ab production in FcRn/ mice, wild-type and FcRn/ mice were passively immunized with anti-oxycodone mAb 24 h prior to the drug challenge. Passively immunized FcRn/ mice showed a significant increase in serum oxycodone levels compared with control-treated mice ( [Fig. 5E](javascript:;)) and a significant reduction in brain-to-serum ratio oxycodone concentration compared with control-treated mice ( [Fig. 5F](javascript:;)), but the reduction in the brain-to-serum ratio was greater in immunized wild-type mice. Passively immunized FcRn/ mice also showed lower of mAbs compared with wild-type mice ( [Fig. 5D](javascript:;)), indicating that reduced vaccine performance in FcRn/ mice is likely a result of loss of FcRn recycling function to maintain serum Ab levels. Because high levels of anti-drug polyclonal Abs or mAbs are required for efficacy against the target drug, these data suggest that FcRn plays a critical role in maintaining efficacious levels of serum Ab upon active vaccination, and it is necessary to achieve optimal pharmacokinetic performance of both vaccines and mAbs. [Close modal](javascript:;) Discussion Vaccines have been one of the most effective medical innovations against infectious diseases, and their introduction resulted in significant prolongation of human lives ( [38](javascript:;)). Beyond infectious diseases, vaccines have been tested against a number of non-communicable chronic diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, dementia, and SUD. As an alternative or complementary treatment option to pharmacotherapy for SUD involving agonists and antagonists of the opioid receptor, vaccines and mAbs have been proposed as a viable strategy to treat OUD and prevent overdose ( [12](javascript:;)). While the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying vaccine- or mAb-induced protection against infectious diseases is an active area of investigation, less is known about the immunological mechanism of vaccines and mAbs against drugs of abuse, or against other small molecules such as nerve agents or other toxic chemicals. Understanding the cellular and molecular processes associated with vaccine or mAb efficacy will speed and optimize translation of safe, long-lasting, and cost-effective therapeutic or prophylactic interventions. Because binding of small-molecule drug targets to drug-specific Abs are thought to be unlikely to cause Ab aggregation or to induce conformational changes in the Fc region to promote Fc receptor engagement, it is expected that Ab-mediated neutralization of opioids does not depend on FcR. However, no previous studies have directly tested these hypotheses. While previous reports found that IgG subclasses correlate with vaccine efficacy in mice, it is not clear whether the increased vaccine efficacy associated with IgG2a and IgG3 responses is due to their ability to trigger effector functions such as phagocytosis, or is simply a reflection of a more mature B cell response or higher B cell numbers involving extensive class switch and recombination events, which would lead to a more effective polyclonal Ab response. Specifically, our laboratory showed a primarily IgG1 polyclonal anti-oxycodone Ab response to OXY-KLH vaccines in BALB/c mice, and that IL-4 depleted or IL-4/ mice had increased levels of Abs, but also a skewing toward IgG2a that resulted in enhanced vaccine efficacy ( [21](javascript:;)). However, it was unclear in these studies whether the presence of increased IgG2a increased efficacy due to subclass-dependent effector functions, or because of increased concentration of Ab overall. In this study, we explored the role of Ab effector functions in mediating vaccine efficacy against oxycodone. We found that phagocytic macrophages and granulocytes are dispensable for mediating vaccine efficacy. Depletion of macrophages and granulocytes at the time of acute drug challenge did not affect vaccine efficacy, demonstrating that phagocytosis is not necessary for mediating vaccine efficacy. Use of oxycodone-specific F(ab)2 showed that Abs lacking the Fc portion were still able to reduce oxycodone distribution to the brain in a dose-dependent manner, providing initial evidence that the Fc portion is not required for neutralization. However, F(ab)2 was not as effective as mAbs, where even a dose equivalent to 100 mg/kg mAb was not sufficient to match the efficacy of 40 mg/kg intact mAb. There are likely several factors contributing to this effect. First, the serum distribution of F(ab)2 to serum was low compared with mAb 24 h after passive immunization, which may reflect reduced serum half-life typical of F(ab)2 and other Fab isoforms lacking Fc region ( [34](javascript:;), [35](javascript:;)). Also, the reduced m.w. of F(ab)2 may render it more able to permeate the blood-brain barrier, or increase its distribution to other tissues. While one factor complicating analysis was the somewhat variable antinociceptive response of mouse strains to doses of oxycodone used in these studies, concerns were mitigated by data reporting the efficacy of vaccines and mAb in altering the distribution of oxycodone to the serum and brain compartments. BALB/c mice used macrophage FcRIII/ mice only mild in to 2.5 mg/kg oxycodone challenge ( [Supplemental Fig. 2B](/jimmunol/article-supplement/234239/pdf/ji_2100204_supplemental_1/)). Hence, for later experiments with C57BL/6 mice, doses of 5.0 mg/kg oxycodone were used for acute challenges to achieve a relevant pharmacological effect of the drug. Notably, FcRn/ mice immunized with control vaccine showed higher antinociception in response to oxycodone compared with wild-type control mice ( [Supplemental Fig. 2C](/jimmunol/article-supplement/234239/pdf/ji_2100204_supplemental_1/)). Because of individual variability and strain-dependent differences, particularly when genetic deletion of immune receptors that may have an unknown physiological impact is involved, the direct measurement of drug sequestration by the brain-to-serum oxycodone ratio provided a more reliable measure of performance of these vaccines. Ablation of FcRIII alone, and then FcRI-IV, did not affect efficacy of an OXY-KLH vaccine. Collectively, this indicates that neutralization is the predominant mechanism for vaccine and mAb efficacy. Analysis of oxycodone-specific Ab titers from actively immunized mice showed that loss of these receptors did not impact the overall level of vaccine-elicited Abs. Because genetic deletion of FcR may cause alterations in the immune response to vaccine that could produce differences in Ab affinity or stability not captured by Ab titers, additional studies were conducted using passive immunization with our lead oxycodone-specific mAb. As with active immunization, passive immunization of FcRI-IV/ mice showed similar efficacy as in wild-type mice, further supporting that these receptors are not necessary for efficacy. Importantly, a significant role in vaccine efficacy was identified for FcRn, as deletion of FcRn resulted in substantial reduction both of vaccine-induced Ab and of vaccine efficacy during oxycodone challenge. Passive immunization of these mice with oxycodone-specific mAbs also demonstrated reduced mAb retention in serum and performance of mAbs against oxycodone in the absence of FcRn, indicating that this receptor is needed for optimal in vivo half-life and correlates with increased efficacy. Future studies will investigate Ab engineering at the Fc portion to achieve optimal engagement of FcRn, and improve the pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic profile of mAbs against opioids or other drugs of abuse ( [26](javascript:;), [39](javascript:;)). Furthermore, clinical studies of vaccines against OUD or SUD should take in account that individual variability may originate from genetic polymorphisms related to the FcRn pathway. While these results suggest that Fc receptors other than FcRn do not contribute to efficacy in mice, differences between mouse and human IgG and Fc receptors (reviewed in Ref. [40](javascript:;)) must be considered as vaccines and mAbs for SUD advance into clinical trials, both to optimize efficacy and to predict occurrence of side effects. Another limitation of this study is that experiments focused on the role of IgG, whereas the role of other Ig classes was not investigated. For instance, it would be of interest to test the efficacy of IgA mAbs and subsequently IgA Fc receptors against drugs of abuse. Past studies have shown that vaccine-induced IgA in the bronchoalveolar space may have the ability to retain nicotine upon cigarette smoke inhalation ( [41](javascript:;)). Because some drugs are at high concentrations at the mucosal interface and IgA can be translocated there at higher concentrations, a future area of exploration could focus on development of vaccines and mAbs based on IgA against inhaled drugs of abuse and other toxic inhalants. In conclusion, this study provides the basis for focusing development of immunotherapeutic formulations providing high-affinity neutralizing polyclonal Abs or mAbs, although less emphasis should be focused on assessment of the Ab isotype or its FcRI-IV-binding capabilities. These data support the notion that efforts should be devoted to development of mAb variants engineered for high neutralization capacity, increased FcRn binding, and extended serum half-life.
