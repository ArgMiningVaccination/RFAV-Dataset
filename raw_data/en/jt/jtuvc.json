But else can we do to support our mind and help relieve stress, especially during these stressful times? Some of us may see a therapist, some may drink wine, meditate or do yoga. But have you tried acupuncture? While there are many ways to care for ourselves, it's nice to have another tool. The practice of acupuncture will help support you to relax, release stress and ease pain from body and mind. Certified acupuncturist Nina Jatuparisuthiseen of Nina Acupuncture is excited to offer a special program starting in April. The 60-minute session is a combination of guided meditation led by Anna Pattera, Certified Mindfulness Meditation Teacher and [NADA Protocol ear acupuncture](https://acudetox.com/nada-protocol/) by Nina. It's a gentle way to experience and learn more about acupuncture and meditation and reap long lasting benefits. Learn more about Anna Pattera's meditation program at [www.ah-meditation.com](www.ah-meditation.com). NADA ear acupuncture involves the gentle placement of up to five small, sterilized disposable needles into specific sites on each ear. The recipients sit or lie down quietly in a group setting for 30-45 minutes, allowing the treatment to take effect. NADA ear acupuncture is an adjunct therapy which is clinically effective, cost-efficient, drug-free and compatible cross-culturally. During the session you will be guided through mindful meditations, e.g. body scans, awareness training and compassion practices. Studies have shown that after practicing meditation training the intensity of stress including pain you feel diminishes. It can transform how you face pain, by including all three main players: physical, emotional and thoughts. The sessions will allow yourself to slow down and heal. The combination of these two therapies provide an additional coping mechanism for you to be able to navigate life and cultivate compassion for yourself and others. Nina explains, \"I offer this program because I want to give my patients and the community a tool to be able to handle stress, including pain, in a supportive way. It is like a gym for your heart and mind to keep you strong and fit, and resilient to whatever challenges you face.\" Who would benefit? Anyone seeking space, tranquility and needing to feel more grounded, release stress and travel inward to embrace all experiences that arise. When? Mondays at 6.30 pm, starting in April - June 2023.
