What are your chances of getting pregnant? If you're wondering what your odds are of getting pregnant, your chances are pretty good when you're younger. In fact, an average healthy couple in their 20s and early 30s has about a 25 to 30 percent chance of getting pregnant during any one menstrual cycle, [according to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG)](//www.acog.org/womens-health/faqs/evaluating-infertility). [[1]](javascript:void(0)) Though that number may seem low, over the span of a year it means your chances of conceiving are about 75 to 85 percent. Just keep in mind that those odds drop with age, which may be a factor if you're finding that it's difficult for you to get pregnant. What affects your chances of getting pregnant? A number of factors can contribute to infertility in women or impact your chances of conception. If any of these affects you (or you think they might), talk to your doctor about what steps to take: - Age. One of the biggest factors is your age, since fertility declines over time. For example, the average, healthy 30-year-old has about a 20 percent chance of getting pregnant each month she tries. By age 40, the odds drop to less than 10 percent each month. - Smoking. Up to 13 percent of infertility in women is caused by cigarette smoking, according to the American Society for Reproductive Medicine (ASRM). Smoking can lead to fertility problems in men, too, since it can reduce sperm production. If you or your partner smoke, explore ways to quit before pregnancy. - Drinking alcohol. Alcohol may decrease your chances of conceiving, so it's best not to drink while in baby-making mode. - Caffeine intake. Research suggests 1 to 2 cups of 6 to 8 ounces of coffee a day is okay, but more that that could affect your efforts. - Weight. Being overweight or obese can cause the body to produce too much estrogen, which can throw off your reproductive cycle. On the other hand, being underweight can shut down ovulation. About 12 percent of all infertility cases are a result of a woman weighing either too little or too much, according to the ASRM. - Health issues. [Endometriosis](//www.whattoexpect.com/getting-pregnant/ovulation/endometriosis/), [polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS)](//www.whattoexpect.com/getting-pregnant/pcos/), uterine fibroids and abnormalities of the uterus caused by previous surgeries or scarring can impair fertility. Other illnesses left untreated (including kidney disease, celiac disease, thyroid disease and sickle cell anemia in men) may also affect pregnancy odds. - Irregular menstrual cycles. If your [cycles are irregular](//www.whattoexpect.com/getting-pregnant/missed-period/)\u2014 whether due to hormonal imbalances like PCOS, weight issues or medications you take \u2014 it can be tougher to figure out [when you're ovulating](//www.whattoexpect.com/getting-pregnant/fertility/five-ways-to-tell-you-are-ovulating.aspx). Having sex regularly is one way to increase your chances of getting pregnant. - Autoimmune disorders. Are you being treated for your autoimmune disorder? If not, sometimes getting the autoimmune disease under control can improve fertility. [Lupus](//www.whattoexpect.com/pregnancy/lupus/)can affect a woman's chances of getting or staying pregnant. Type 1 diabetes and [rheumatoid arthritis](//www.whattoexpect.com/pregnancy/pregnancy-health/rheumatoid-arthritis-during-pregnancy/)can also cause infertility. - Sexually transmitted infections (STIs). Untreated STIs (usually gonorrhea and chlamydia) can lead to [pelvic inflammatory disease (PID)](//www.everydayhealth.com/pid/guide/), which can cause permanent damage to the fallopian tubes, uterus and surrounding tissues. This can make it difficult or impossible to get pregnant. Fortunately, timely treatment of STIs can help you avoid PID. If you're sexually active with more than one partner, see your OB/GYN regularly. - Occupational exposure to environmental toxins. Some research has shown that prolonged exposure to pesticides, pollutants and industrial chemicals \u2014 which usually occurs in certain jobs (more on that below) \u2014 can decrease a couple's chances of conceiving. For women, these toxins can disrupt the menstrual cycle or sex hormone production and reduce fertility and have also been linked to miscarriage. Men may have low hormone levels, a lower sex drive, reduction in sperm or erectile dysfunction. - Excessive exercise. Even if your weight is just right, exercising too hard (or long, like more than five hours a week) can affect baby-making. But that doesn't mean you should let your gym membership lapse. Regular, moderate exercise has been found to slightly increase fertility for all women, regardless of weight. Getting pregnant at any age Age is a big factor in upping the odds of successful conception. If you're wondering about the peak age to get pregnant or what age is too late, here's the lowdown. [[2]](javascript:void(0)) Read This Next Getting pregnant when you're under 35 Advantages - Assuming no medical issues affect their fertility, younger women typically find it easier to get pregnant. In fact, the peak age to get pregnant is between the late teens and late 20s. - Getting pregnant earlier means you'll probably have plenty of energy to care for a baby and keep up with an always-on-the-go toddler. - The odds of miscarriage, preterm birth, birth defects, genetic abnormalities and pregnancy complications like [high blood pressure](//www.whattoexpect.com/pregnancy/high-blood-pressure/)and [gestational diabetes](//www.whattoexpect.com/pregnancy/pregnancy-health/gestational-diabetes/)are all lower among women under 35. - Having a baby while you're younger means that your parents (your child's grandparents!) will be younger too. Disadvantages - Younger parents may not be as financially stable as those who are older. And a family may require a dual income \u2014 so you may have to work at least part-time, even if you'd prefer to stay at home. - The relationship of young couples might not be as stable, and adding a pregnancy and baby to the equation can cause additional strain. - Starting a family earlier can make keeping up relationships with non-parent friends more challenging. Women under 35 should see a specialist if they're unsuccessful at getting pregnant after 12 months of trying. Getting pregnant when you're 35 and up Advantages - When you're older, you're more likely to be financially secure, which can be a necessity in preparing for baby's arrival and care. - Older moms tend to be more established in their careers, so you may find it easier to return to work (if you choose). - Your relationship with your partner may be more stable, which benefits you and baby. - Waiting gives you more time to travel and hit other goals on your to-do list, which may help guard against any \"fear of missing out.\" Disadvantages - It can be more difficult to get pregnant. - If you have trouble conceiving, you may need [in vitro fertilization (IVF)](//www.whattoexpect.com/getting-pregnant/ivf/)or [other fertility treatments](//www.whattoexpect.com/getting-pregnant/fertility-tests-and-treatments/top-fertility-treatments/), which can be expensive. - Pregnancy at an older age increases the risk for [ectopic pregnancy](//www.whattoexpect.com/pregnancy/ectopic-pregnancy/), [miscarriage](//www.whattoexpect.com/pregnancy/miscarriage/), preterm birth, stillbirth, [preeclampsia](//www.whattoexpect.com/pregnancy/preeclampsia/), gestational diabetes and birth defects. - Older women are more likely to need a [C-section](//www.whattoexpect.com/pregnancy/c-section/). - You might not have as much energy as younger parents, making keeping up with a baby or active toddler more challenging. - Health issues like diabetes and hypertension are more likely as you age. These can affect your chances of getting pregnant. Women who are older than 35 and have been trying unsuccessfully to get pregnant for six months should see a specialist. Women who are over 40 and trying to conceive should see a specialist immediately. Tips for getting pregnant No matter your age, the following tips for getting pregnant will help boost your odds of conceiving and ensure you have a healthier nine months when you do. Schedule a preconception visit Book a [preconception appointment](//www.whattoexpect.com/getting-pregnant/health-and-wellness/your-preconception-checkup/) with your doctor to make sure you're in tip-top baby-making shape.

Check your family tree Get the scoop on the health history on both sides of the family tree (you and your partner's). It's especially important to find out if there's a history of genetic or chromosomal disorders like Down syndrome, Tay-Sachs disease, sickle cell anemia, thalassemia, hemophilia, cystic fibrosis, muscular dystrophy or fragile X syndrome. If you have a family history or are [at risk of certain genetic diseases](//www.whattoexpect.com/getting-pregnant/health-and-wellness/carrier-genetic-screenings/), ask your practitioner at that prenatal visit about getting a carrier screening before trying to conceive. A family history of cancers, especially at a young age, is also a reason to seek genetic consultation. Learning more about you and your partner's history before you get pregnant can give you time to prepare and address any concerns. Get treated If any test in your checkup uncovers a condition that requires treatment \u2014 from a health condition like high blood pressure to a sexually transmitted disease \u2014 make sure to take care of it before trying to conceive. That includes any gynecological conditions that might interfere with pregnancy (such as uterine polyps, fibroids, cysts or tumors; endometriosis; pelvic inflammatory disease; or recurrent UTIs). Control chronic illnesses If you have diabetes, asthma, a heart condition, lupus, epilepsy or any other chronic condition, be sure you have your doctor's okay to get pregnant. You'll want to make sure to work with your doctor to get your condition under control before you conceive. Avoid environmental hazards Some chemicals are potentially harmful to you and your developing baby. So take special care if you work in certain fields (like medicine, dentistry, art, photography, transportation, farming, landscaping, construction, hairdressing, cosmetology, dry cleaning and some factories). Check out the [Occupational Safety and Health Administration](//www.osha.gov/SLTC/reproductivehazards/index.html) for the latest info on [job safety and pregnancy](//www.whattoexpect.com/pregnancy/working-while-pregnant).

Check in with your dentist [A visit to the dentist](//www.whattoexpect.com/pregnancy/pregnancy-health/oral-health-during-pregnancy) before you get pregnant is almost as important as a visit to the doctor. That's because your future [pregnancy can affect your mouth](//www.whattoexpect.com/pregnancy/symptoms-and-solutions/gums-bleeding-sore.aspx) \u2014 and vice versa. Be sure to have any necessary work (like X-rays, fillings or dental surgery) completed now so it won't have to be done during pregnancy. The gum disease gingivitis (inflammation of the mouth) may be more common in pregnancy due to hormonal changes (the extra progesterone can increase your susceptibility to plaque). You'll want to make sure to see the dentist for treatment in order to protect against an increased risk of complications like preterm birth and preeclampsia. Start looking for a prenatal practitioner [Choosing a practitioner for your pregnancy](//www.whattoexpect.com/pregnancy/your-health/prenatal-care-doctors) is easier now than when you're due for your first prenatal checkup.

Sure, you know the basics of how to get pregnant, but having all of the relevant information at hand when you're trying to conceive is smart. If you take your age into account and keep a close eye on your health, your goals of getting pregnant and having a healthy baby are definitely within reach. "}
