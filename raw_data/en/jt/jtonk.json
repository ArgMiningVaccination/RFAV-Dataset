With a holistic approach, it combines homeopathic medicine and other techniques with traditional western medicine. | | Rudolph Steiner recommended new medicinal substances as well as specific methods for preparing them. One such preparation is made of mistletoe, and it has evolved into a cancer drug that is used to treat cancer, today. | Steiner and Dr. Ita Wegman (1876-1943) worked closely to develop the principles of anthroposophic medicine and their application. In 1921, the first anthroposophic medical clinic was opened in Arlesheim, Switzerland, by Dr. Wegman. There are currently anthroposophical medical practices in over 60 countries. | | Rudolph Steiner, PhD | || | | | Ida Wegman, MD |Dr. Wegman also co-founded the pharmaceutical laboratory, Weleda, a producer of medicines and health care products. | Steiner insisted that all anthroposophical doctors be licensed, board certified medical doctors. So, the first requirement to practice anthroposophically extended medicine is to obtain a conventional MD degree and board certification. After completing conventional medical training, a medical doctor extends their knowledge by adding further perspectives and additional treatment | techniques by taking extension courses. Anthroposophical doctors accept all the tools in conventional medicine, and every option is considered for its appropriateness in a specific instance. For example, antibiotics are used when necessary, as are homeopathics; physical therapy is prescribed, as well as curative eurythmy (movement exercise to balance the forces within the body) and massage. Psychological counseling may also be prescribed. | | | Anthroposophical doctors deal with all ages and all types of conditions. The toolbox of techniques and medications has proven to be useful and effective, especially in treating chronic and long-term conditions. | |[Dr. Tiffany Baer](about_us.htm) Dr. Tiffany Baer is board certified in Internal Medicine and Holistic Medicine.
