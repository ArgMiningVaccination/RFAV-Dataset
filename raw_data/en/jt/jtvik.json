You can boost your energy without stimulants or other harmful chemicals by taking Cordyceps mushroom extract capsules daily. Some people can even skip their morning caffeine and take cordyceps mushroom supplements instead. There are numerous benefits associated with Cordyceps mushroom extract. It can improve stamina and endurance by supporting the lungs during intense exercise and this is why many athletes take our ENERGIZE Now Cordyceps [mushroom capsules](/products/cordycepts-capsules).

With many distractions around us in a busy world, staying focused and 100% productive can be difficult. Taking FOCUS Now [Lion's Mane capsules](/products/lions-mane-capsules) any time of day can improve your memory, concentration, productivity, and even gut health! There are numerous brain benefits associated with Lion's Mane extract because the beneficial compounds it contains can cross the blood-brain barrier. It can promote the synthesis of NGF (Nerve Growth Factor), which regulates nerve cell growth and reproduction making it possible for the brain to heal and repair itself. As well, several studies have shown that Lion's mane extract has the potential to prevent damage to the brain associated with neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's and dementia. Reishi mushroom extract has long been considered one of the most powerful traditional medicines on the planet for improving overall health and promoting longevity. It's well known as the mushroom of immortality, but we like to call it \"herbal yoga\"! Many people who once relied on pharmaceutical medications to reduce anxiety and get a good night's sleep, have been able to switch to [Reishi Mushroom supplements](/products/reishi-mushroom-supplement) with verified triterpene percentages (like Eversio's CHILL Now) for effective support without the side effects of chemical treatments. Reishi mushroom extract benefits include reduced anxiety and depression, treatment of insomnia, and calming the mind for better quality sleep. Reishi has also been studied for normalizing hormone levels and benefiting heart health. It's a great time to commit to daily prevention of viral infections and to naturally strengthen your immune system with [Turkey Tail mushroom capsules](/products/turkey-tail-mushroom-capsules)!

Add half a teaspoon of BALANCE Blend to any beverage or recipe, and feel good about this easy upgrade to your wellness routine! Aging happens! The human lifespan basically reflects the level of free radical damage that accumulates in our cells. When enough damage accumulates, cells can't survive, and they give up. To put it simply, as we age, we are \"rusting\" just like metal rusts with oxidation. This is why we get wrinkles, lose our memories, and experience organ system breakdowns as we get older. Count on the [REJUVENATE Blend](/products/six-mushroom-blend) of medicinal mushrooms, including Chaga, Tremella, Oyster, Lion's Mane, Shiitake, and Maitake, to slow this process down. These six medicinal mushrooms are known to have the highest percentages of ergothioneine - a SUPERSTAR antioxidant. Add 1/2 teaspoon to your routine and know that you are supporting the beauty of all-natural youthfulness from within. If you have a wellness goal, Mother Nature has created a medicinal mushroom to support it. We believe there is a mushroom for EVERY MOMENT! It's our mission to help you find the right medicinal mushroom extract product to optimize your health and create a positive change today! Health Canada enforces strict regulations when it comes to mushroom supplements for Canadians. All of Eversio's NPN licensed medicinal mushroom supplements meet or exceed these standards, including the listed maximum acceptable dose per day. It is common knowledge in the mushroom wellness research space that at least 3000mg quantity crude equivalent (QCE) of any medicinal mushroom is required per day to achieve therapeutic effectiveness. Various conditions and health goals often demand even higher doses alongside prolonged use. You can be confident that all Eversio products list and provide more than 3000mg QCE per capsule (or \u00bd tsp of powdered extract blend) for an efficacious dose of mushroom wellness in a very small, but powerful serving. We are obsessive not only about the quality of the finished mushroom supplements we produce here in British Columbia, but also on how our medicinal mushrooms are cultivated from the very beginning. Our mushrooms are grown on USDA Organic Certified mushroom bases in the majestic mountains of the regions in the world where each mushroom naturally grows. They are cultivated outdoors on wood, the way they grow in nature. In our forests, medicinal mushrooms have not evolved to grow on grain. They grow on the wood that contains the precursors to their beneficial compounds that we know are responsible for their benefits. Our Eversio guarantee is that NO GRAINS will ever be included in any of our mushroom supplements so that we can deliver the highest potency for the greatest [mushroom supplement benefits](/pages/our-mushrooms). Mushrooms are naturally rich in the antioxidants and other specialized beneficial compounds needed by the body and brain for optimal well-being. Our team of experts is confident that medicinal mushrooms MUST be hot water or hot water and alcohol (dual) extracted to guarantee bioavailability of these compounds and to create the potency required for therapeutic effectiveness. Our extraction process isolates and concentrates Beta-D-Glucans, terpenes, triterpenes, ergothioneine, adenosine, cordycepin, betulinic acid, have worked hard to deliver the [mushroom supplements benefits and effects](/pages/our-mushrooms) that are well documented in thousands of studies. Unfortunately, many of the mushroom supplements available in Canada and the U.S. today are made from un-extracted ground up mushrooms, un-extracted mycelium on grain, or tinctures. These products are significantly less potent than the mushroom extract supplements used in clinical research. We focus on current research, clinically effective formulations, and verified third party testing to provide potent and effective mushroom supplements that change lives. We control the effectiveness of the organic medicinal mushroom supplements we create by sourcing USDA Organic Certified, whole fruiting body mushrooms from around the world based on the highest quality available on any given day. Extensive third party testing is completed as per our own specifications by labs in both Canada and the U.S. to confirm our premium quality and therapeutic potency. Eversio's own team, including our mycologist, pharmacist, and naturopathic doctor, verify the third party testing of our products to ensure they are the absolute best mushroom supplement products you will find on the market today. We openly share our COAs and list our high percentages of beneficial compounds right on every label for 100% confidence and transparency! We love them all, but these are our favourites right now! Many of the mushroom supplements available today are made from un-extracted ground up mushrooms, un-extracted mycelium on grain, or alcohol based tinctures. These products are significantly lower in beneficial compounds than the mushroom extract supplements used in clinical research that verifies the power and effectiveness of medicinal mushrooms to address so many health concerns. Here at [Eversio Wellness](/pages/about), we only use extracts made from the whole fruiting bodies of outdoor grown medicinal mushrooms to create our products. In nature, medicinal mushrooms grow on wood in oxygen rich environments that offer the nutrients needed to develop their potency. Our medicinal mushrooms are cultivated by experts on USDA organic certified farms so that you can experience medicinal mushroom benefits the way Mother Nature intended. Feel the Eversio difference today! There is a misconception that mushroom supplements must taste bad.

Our high potency mushroom supplement powdered blends are an excellent way to upgrade your coffee, tea, smoothies, oatmeal, yogurt, soups, bone broth, stews, and more!

Eversio Wellness is becoming one of the most trusted mushroom supplement brands on the market today because we are a family of mushroom nerds committed to our mission to change lives through fungi. We aren't a supplement company - we are a mushroom company and we don't do anything else! Fungi are critical to the maintenance of our food supply, ecosystems, physical well-being, and even mental health, but they are likely the least known and most misunderstood organisms on Earth. We believe mushrooms represent an interconnectivity that our planet is ready to return to after centuries of movement toward disconnection from nature and each other. We know they have so much to offer humanity and we love to share their wisdom any chance we get. [Our team of passionate and professional individuals](/pages/about) who are experts in their fields, including a pharmacist, a mycologist, a naturopathic doctor, a registered clinical counselor, an educator, and an entrepreneur, all believe that the FUTURE IS FUNGI.
