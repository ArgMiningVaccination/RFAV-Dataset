They would make up what became known as the wild west and would've been existing at the same time as the famous gunslingers. They would be known for their skill with the bow and arrow and their fearless warriors. Southwest Indians create many beautiful pieces of art. They make and use pottery , clothing and baskets, as well as some that are still sold in stores and arts and craft shows. Because they are very spiritual tribes, most of their art contains symbols and signs of their beliefs, dreams, and visions . The clothing they make can be anything from an outfit, such as a dress with gorgeous flowers on it, to an elaborately decorated headdress, full of feathers. The Zuni and Hopi Southwest Indians carved Kachina dolls, out of wood. They were decorated with masks and costumes to represent the Kachina spirits. They help children of the tribe learn tribal ceremonies. THE INDIGENOUS PEOPLES OF THE SOUTHWEST In the current states of: Colorado Utah Nevada Arizona (currently 297,000 people) New Mexico (currently 193,300 people) Also in the states of Sonora and Chihuahua, in northern Mexico. \"Extending north to south from Durango, Mexico to Durango, Colorado and east to west from Las Vegas, Nevada to Las Vegas, New Mexico.\" . THOUSANDS OF YEARS AGO, ANCIENT PEOPLE FIRST SETTLED IN THE DEEP CANYONS OF PRESENT -DAY NEW MEXICO. The Pueblo people (also called Anasazi) The Hohokam people The Mogollon people They built cities carved into the cliffs and created complex canals to water crops in the desert. Almost all of the Southwestern tribes, which later spread out into present -day Arizona, Texas, and northern Mexico, can trace their ancestry back to these civilizations. 2 powerful Southwest tribes were the exception: the Navajo and the Apache. They moved into the region from the Arctic, between the 1200s and 1500s. They were hunters who followed their game across a wide territory and who often raided the other tribes in the area for food. SOUTHWEST NATIVE AMERICANS These tribes made contact with Europeans, specifically the Spanish, early. They would go on to become powerful foes to the Americans as they began to expand to the west. The Pre -Columbian culture of the American Southwest and Northern Mexico evolved into 3 major archaeological culture areas. 1) The Ancestral Pueblo peoples, or Anasazi, culture was centered around the present -day Four Corners area. Their distinctive pottery and dwelling construction styles emerged in the area around 750 CE. Ancestral Pueblo peoples are renowned for the construction of and cultural achievement present at Pueblo Bonito and other sites in Chaco Canyon, as well as Mesa Verde, Aztec Ruins, and Salmon Ruins. 2) The Hohokam tradition is centered on the middle Gila River and lower Salt River drainage areas, and extending into the southern Sonoran Desert It emerged in approximately 200 CE. These people lived in smaller settlement clusters than their neighbors and built extensive irrigation canals for a wide range of agricultural crops. There is evidence the Hohokam had far -reaching trade routes with ancient Mesoamerican cultures to the south and show cultural influences from these southerners. 3) Mogollon peoples lived in the southwest from approximately 200 CE until sometime between 1450 and 1540 CE. CHACO CANYON IN NEW MEXICO It was a center for the Anasazi people, a trade hub and home to over 12,000 people, from the 9th to the 12th century CE. The Chacoans , a branch of the Anasazi people living in the canyon, created over 400 miles of roads that connected the town to other villages in the region. They mostly traded: Turquoise Traveled west for seashells from California South for exotic birds from Central America North for minerals and ores from the Rocky Mountains.

DOORWAYS, CHACO BENJAMIN OSWALD (CC BY -NC-SA)CHACO CULTURE POTTERY - PUEBLO ALTO, CHACO CANYON THE ANCESTRAL PUEBLOANS, ALSO KNOWN AS THE ANASAZI, They were an ancient Native American culture that spanned the present -day 4 Corners region of the United States - Southeastern Utah, Northeastern Arizona, Northwestern New Mexico, and Southwestern Colorado. They lived in a range of structures - small family pit houses, larger structures to house clans, grand pueblos, and cliff -sited dwellings for defense. They had a complex network linking hundreds of communities and population centers across the Colorado Plateau. They held a distinct knowledge of celestial sciences that found form in their architecture. The Cliff Palace, which has 150 rooms, 23 kivas, and several towers, at Mesa Verde National Park in Colorado.THE KIVA It was a religious congregational space that was used mostly for ritual ceremonies and was an integral part of the community structure. It was used by both Ancestral and modern Pueblos. SOUTHWEST NATIVE AMERICANS Member of any of the Native American peoples inhabiting the southwestern United States. More than 20 percent of Native Americans in the United States live in this region, principally in the present -day states of Arizona and New Mexico. The Southwest culture area is located between the Rocky Mountains and the Mexican Sierra Madre. 25 SOUTHWEST TRIBES Apache Cocopah TRIBES FROM THE SOUTHWEST, WHO WILL BE DISCUSSED 1.Apache: Apache Indians of the Southwest fought a series of battles against the U.S. government in what is called the Apache Wars. NOTE: The locations of the 5 Apache groups, are also shown in the map. 2.Hopi : It is translated to mean peaceful person. 3.Navajo : The Navajo Indians of the Southwest have the largest Indian reservation in the U.S. 4.Pueblo : The word \"pueblo\" comes from the Spanish word \"town\". 5.Zuni : The Zuni are a very religious, peaceful and non -threatening tribe. APACHE TRIBES While every Indian tribe and nation played a significant role in our culture, only a few can claim to have influenced thewild west more than the Apache. The Apache were fierce warriors who refused to relinquish their land despite growing odds against them. They are distant cousins to the Navajo, with which they share the Southern Athabaskan languages . Historically, the Apache homelands have consisted of high mountains, sheltered and watered valleys, deep canyons, deserts, and the southern Great Plains. This includes areas in what is now: Eastern Arizona Northern Mexico (Sonora and Chihuahua) New Mexico West Texas Southern Colorado. These areas are collectively known as Apacheria . The Apache tribes fought the invading Spanish and Mexican peoples for centuries. During the American -Indian wars, the U.S. Army found the Apache to be fierce warriors and skillful strategists. PRESENT -DAY PRIMARY LOCATIONS OF APACHEAN PEOPLESLIST OF APACHE TRIBES The term Apache refers to 6 major Apache -speaking groups: Jicarilla -Lived in Northern New Mexico, Southern Colorado, and the Texas Panhandle Chiricahua -Lived in Southeastern Arizona Mescalero -Lived in Eastern New Mexico Plains Apache -Lived around Colorado and eventually Oklahoma Western Apache -Includes various kinship groups. Lived within the boundaries of Arizona. Chasi , a Warm Springs Apache musician playing the Apache fiddle, 1886, photo by A. Frank Randall Chief James A. Garfield. Jicarilla Apache. 1899. Photo By William Henry JacksonGERONIMO He was a prominent leader and medicine man from the Bedonkohe band of the Ndendahe Apache people. He was not a chief but rather a shaman. From 1850 to 1886, Geronimo joined with members of three other Central Apache bands -the Tchihende , the Tsokanende and the Nednhi -to carry out numerous raids, as well as fight against Mexican and the U.S. The Apache people stood in awe of Geronimo's \"powers\", which he demonstrated to them on a series of occasions. These powers indicated to other Apaches , that he had supernatural gifts that he could use for good or ill. In eyewitness accounts by other Apaches , Geronimo was able to become aware of distant events as they happened, and he was able to anticipate future events. He also demonstrated powers to heal other Apaches .GERONIMO -GOYAA\u00c9. APACHE. 1898 PHOTO BY F.A. RINEHARTTHE HOPI The Hopi are a Native American tribe who primarily live on the Hopi Reservation in northeastern Arizona. As of the 2010 census, there are 19,338 Hopi in the country and their Reservation covers 2,532 square miles. The Hopi encountered Spaniards in the 16th century, and are historically referred to as Pueblo people, because they lived in villages (pueblos in the Spanish language). They are thought to be descended from the Ancestral Puebloans who constructed large apartment -house complexes and had an advanced culture. The primary meaning of the word \"Hopi\" is \"behaving one, one who is mannered, civilized, peaceable, and polite. To be Hopi is towards a state of total reverence for all things, peace with these things, and life in accordance with the instructions of Maasaw , the Creator or Caretaker of Earth. HOPI KACHINA DOLL Representing the spirit of Hopi, these dolls were basically prepared as gifts for tribal children, and they all had a different meaning and significance. According to Native American traditions, the Ka\u00e7hinas carried the holy spirits that roamed San Francisco and the outskirts of Arizona. In ceremonial events, the masked Hopi Pueblos symbolized the spirits and distributed these dolls to the children with candy and different styles of toys among traditional dances. Escapes were considered the spirits of gods, animals, or deceased tribesmen known for their special powers. KACHINAS Kachinas were Hopi spirits or gods which lived within the mountains. These spirits were called on to bring rain, make crops grow, heal the sick, or find animals to hunt. Hopi Kachinas talked to the gods by singing and dancing, like for rain. The Hopis made Kachina figures representing the spirits and used them to teach children about tribal religious beliefs.

It occupies portions of northeastern Arizona, northwestern New Mexico, and southeastern Utah; at roughly 27,413 square miles. It is the largest land area held by a Native American tribe in the U.S., exceeding ten U.S. states. In 2010, the reservation was home to 173,667 out of 332,129 Navajo tribal members; the remaining 158,462 tribal members lived outside the reservation.

Hundreds died during the 18 days of marching. About 9,000 Navajos reach the fort, where 400 Mescalero Apaches are already held. The tribes have a history of dispute; many arguments ensue. Food and water run short because there are twice as many people imprisoned as planned. \"As I have said, our ancestors were taken captive and driven to Hw\u00e9\u00e9ldi for no reason at all. They were harmless people, and, even to date, we are the same, holding no harm for anybody ...

The eagle represents the vision, insight, leadership, healing, and wisdom needed to overcome health and life issues. In Native legend, the thunderbird is a powerful spirit in the form of a bird, sometimes eagle - like, who produces thunder from his wings and lightning flashes from his eyes. The thunderbird projects power, protection, and even fear. Courtesy F. B. Wood Collection COLOR IMAGE DEPICTING A CERAMIC STATUE OF A NAVAJO WOMAN WITH HER FACE PAINTED BLUE.

She and her husband Julian, and other family members developed new styles of pottery making to reflect the Pueblo people's legacy of fine artwork and crafts. Her pottery and especially her black ware pottery, survive in many museums in the United States. NATIVE AMERICAN FOODS 60% of the food eaten in the world today was developed over thousands of years by the Indigenous Peoples of the Americas. Traditional foods remain an important part of our cultural identity. Food is a great gift of Mother Earth, and spiritual essence is often associated with gathered, cultivated and hunted/fished foods. A sacred bond exists between humans and foods, from an Indigenous point of view. NATURAL FOODS FROM THE SOUTHWEST EATEN REGULARLY BY NATIVE AMERICANS Roasted agave heart. Arizona walnuts. Berries of the Netleaf Hackberry Fruit of the Catclaw Acacia Honey Seeds and fruit of the Four Wing Saltbush Pads and Fruit of the Prickly Pear Cactus Desert Christmas Cactus Velvet Mesquite flour by grinding its seeds and pods into meal and baking it into cakes, and Its sap was eaten like a candy Ground acorns were used for thickening stews. Agriculture in the Southwest was based on the cultivation of maize, beans, squash and sunflower seeds. The Tepary bean -A staple food of Native peoples in the Southwest for thousands of years because of it' tolerance of drought conditions. They require wet soil to germinate but then prefer dry conditions, so they were generally grown on floodplains that would dry out after heavy rains. Foraging for wild foods also played a major role in the ancient diet of Southwestern peoples. For example, the fruit and seeds of the Saguaro cactus were collected and eaten both fresh and dried, and made into preserves and drinks by tribes such as the Tohono O'odham and Pima. The flower buds of the Cholla cactus have also been collected and roasted in clay lined pits. Prickly pear cactus fruit is also used to make different types of foods. Another important food for Indigenous peoples living in mountainous areas of the Southwest are the seeds of the Pinyon pine, known as \"pine nuts\" or \" pi\u00f1\u00f3ns . The nuts are traditionally a vital source of protein in the winter for the Ute and Paiute peoples. The agave plant has historically been a vital food source, useful to Indigenous people in many ways. Agave hearts can be roasted and relished for their sweetness, and dried agave eaten during the winter months. The tough fibers of agave are used in making baskets and mats. In addition, agave is famously used for distilled spirits such as tequila and mezcal . INTRODUCTION OF AGRICULTURE WITH A FOCUS ON CORN Historians credit Anasazis , Mogollons , and Hohokams as the first farmers in America. Corn, the first crop the Ancestral Pueblos that was cultivated, is part of many creation stories of the Pueblo people. The Ancestral Pueblos regarded the harvest of corn not only as a nutritional necessity but as a spiritual gift. CORN OR MAIZE Corn is a member of the grass family and was first domesticated from a wild grain several thousand years ago by Aztec and Mayan Indians in Mexico and Central America. The first corn was a loose -podded variety, called Teosinte, that looked like the seed head at the top of wheat stalks. The kernels were small and each covered by a hard hull. Central and South American peoples came to depend so heavily on corn --or maize -- that they devised some of the earliest calendars just to keep track of their corn planting and harvesting schedules. CORN'S PARENT PLANT \u2014TEOSINTE Corn comes from a wild grain called teosinte. Because of selective breeding, many people wouldn't know that the grain is corn's parent plant if you put them side by side. Teosinte has different features than the modern -day crop. For instance, teosinte has between just 5 and 10 kernels, while domesticated corn can have over 500 ! For both corn and teosinte, the kernels are the fruits of the plant. From its early origins of teosinte, our edible corn has also developed substantially. With its 'tooth -cracking' hard shell, the teosinte plant had small and hard ears that enveloped the kernels. Generations of breeding softened the hard shell of the original teosinte grain. Today, corn has a longer and softer shell. EAR OF TEOSINTE (WIKIMEDIA)Eventually, corn's popularity spread to North America. By the time the first European settlers arrived on this continent, corn was the chief food crop of the native americans . The colonists quickly learned how to grow corn, and they enthusiastically adopted the new staple. Back then, people raised what's now called field corn . Some corn was eaten fresh, but most of the harvest was cooked in fried cakes, breads and puddings, dried for winter storage or ground into cornmeal and corn flour. Field corn was also used for livestock feed, as it is today. Sweet corn varieties weren't developed until the 1700s. DENT CORN FLINT CORN HEIRLOOM CORN POP CORN SWEET CORNINTERESTING FACTS AND USES FOR CORN Archaeologists have found the domestication of corn to be between 6,000 and 10,000 years old, in central Mexico. Native Americans made over 250 different kinds of corn, in many different colors. More than 90 million acres are grown around the world, yielding 13 billion bushels a year ! Most of it is used to feed livestock 40 percent is used to make ethanol -a gasoline additive. CORN HUSK DOLLS They are made out of the dried leaves or \"husk\" of a corn cob and don't have faces on them. EVERY PART OF THE EAR OF CORN WAS USED : Women braided the husks for rope and twine and coiled them into containers and mats. Shredded husks made good kindling and filling for pillows and mattresses. The corncobs served as bottle stoppers, scrubbing brushes, and fuel for smoking meat. Corn silk made hair for corn husk dolls. 11/3/2022 68THE LEGEND OF THE CORN HUSK DOLL The Iroquois \"Corn Spirit\" asked the Great Spirit, if she could provide something different for her people. With the Great Spirit's permission, she made corn husk dolls to bring joy to children throughout the land. However, there was one corn husk doll that was sung praises for her beauty. One day she looked into a pool of water and admired how beautiful she was. The doll began spending less time with the children and more time staring at herself. The Great Spirit was angry at her vanity and gave her a warning. When the doll didn't stop, the Great Spirit punished her by taking away her face so that she could neither look at herself nor converse with the children ever again! These faceless dolls continue to serve as a reminder never to think you're better than someone else ! 11/3/2022 69 11/3/2022 70ONEIDA CORN HUSK DOLLIROQUOIS CORN HUSK DOLL ONEIDA WOMAN IN TRADITIONAL FORMAL CLOTHING11/3/2022 71NATIVE AMERICAN NATURAL HEALING METHODS THE HERBAL HEALING PRACTICES OF NATIVE AMERICANS \"Man did not weave the web of life; he is merely a strand in it, such that whatever he does to the web, he does to himself.\" They practice their healing arts in a way which includes the natural world and the whole person -body, mind and spirit. They believed: Strongly in the interconnection of all of creation. illness is a sign of misalignment in spirit as well as in the physical body. Addressing the spiritual well -being of the sick is considered equally or even more important than addressing the actual physical ailments. BLESSING FROM THE MEDICINE MAN, Painted by Howard Terpning \u00ae, \u00a9 Howard Terpning Courtesy of The Greenwich Workshop, Inc.MEDICINE WAYS: TRADITIONAL HEALERS AND HEALING Many traditional healers say that most of the healing is done by the patient and that every person has a responsibility for his or her proper behavior and health. This is a serious, lifelong responsibility. Healers serve as facilitators and counselors to help patients heal themselves. Healers use stories, humor, art, music, tobacco, smudging, and ceremonies to bring healing energies into the healing space and focus their effects. The healing process also goes beyond the individual patient. Traditional healers take into account not only the patient's immediate family and community, but future generations as well. A NATIVE AMERICAN MEDICINE BAG OR MEDICINE BUNDLE It is a container for items believed to protect or give spiritual powers to its owner. Varying in size, it could be small enough to wear around the neck, or it could be a large bag with a long strap called a \"bandolier.\" The size of the bag is determined by how many items need to be carried. In historical times, medicine men and shamans generally carried a large medicine bundle that could hold numerous items such as seeds, herbs, pinecones, grass, animal teeth or claws, horsehair, rocks, tobacco, beads, arrowheads, bones, or anything else of relatively small size that possessed spiritual value to the bundle's owner. NATIVE AMERICAN TOOLS & TRADITIONS Animal Spirits or Totems -Animal Totems: The appearance of birds and animals, either in reality or dreamtime, are considered to be totem messengers offering spiritual guidance. Sweat Lodges -The Native American sweat lodge or purification ritual cleans and heals the body, mind, and spirit. My first sweat lodge experience was Gaia themed, honoring the earth mother, and participants mothers and grandmothers. Dreamcatchers -The earliest dreamcatchers (sacred hoops) were crafted for children as healing amulets to protect them from nightmares. . Fetishes -Sacred objects such as feathers, bones, seashells, animal skins, etc. are used as tools to facilitate an awakening into your whole self, used in prayer, or utilized for protection and healing. Prayer Flags -Prayer ties or prayer flags made from fabric and tobacco are offered to The Great Spirit in exchange for blessings. Smudging -Using a smoking smudge wand for purification is part of many Native American traditions. Common herbs used for smudging include sage, sweetgrass, yerba santa leaves and lavender. Ceremonial Peace Pipes -The Native American pipe is smoked in a ceremonial or ritual to call upon the four elements and give an offering to the Great Spirit. Curanderismo -Blending and evolution of Native and Hispanic healing techniques involving herbs, sweats, diet, and magick . Talking Stick -Passing the talking sticks from speaker to speaker is a respectful way to communicate and share opinions. This tradition is especially helpful in keeping disagreements from getting out of hand. Healing Amulets -Amulets or talismans associated with Native American practices include shells, crystals and gemstones, rattles, feathers, animal skin and bones, and Zuni fetishes. Sacred Hoop / Medicine Wheel -Each direction of the medicine wheels offers its own lessons, color association, and animal spirit guide. THE MEDICINE WHEEL AND THE FOUR DIRECTIONS The Medicine Wheel, sometimes known as the Sacred Hoop, has been used by generations of various Native American tribes for health and healing. It embodies the Four Directions, as well as Father Sky, Mother Earth, and Spirit Tree \u2014all of which symbolize dimensions of health and the cycles of life.THE MEDICINE WHEEL It is a stone circle of personal power used to connect your inner self to Mother Earth. By following around the wheel throughout the year, self transformation occurs. These Medicine Wheels of stone, constructed by the original Native inhabitants, once spread across the Americas. They were the ceremonial centers of earth people; powerful vortexes for both giving and receiving earth energy. Earth Peoples used the Medicine Wheel to understand and celebrate change in their own lives and in the cycles of the earth. It consists of 36 stones, each one representing a part of the universe. The people and circle are smudged and then they dress as an animal and dance into the circle by song and drum to make the wheel. The people make their prayers as they unite into balance with the Elements, Earth, Sky, Creator and all Living Things. It stays up for the weekend as a sacred place for the people to pray and heal. THE MEDICINE WHEEL AND THE FOUR DIRECTIONS The Medicine Wheel , sometimes known as the Sacred Hoop, has been used by generations of various Native American tribes, for health and healing. It embodies the Four Directions, as well as Father Sky, Mother Earth, and Spirit Tree \u2014all of which symbolize dimensions of health and the cycles of life. The Medicine Wheel can take many different forms. It can be an artwork such as artifact or painting, or it can be a physical construction on the land. Hundreds or even thousands of Medicine Wheels have been built on Native lands in North America over the last several centuries. Movement in the Medicine Wheel and in Native American ceremonies is circular, and typically in a clockwise, or \"sun -wise\" direction. This helps to align with the forces of Nature, such as gravity and the rising and setting of the Sun.

This wheel, a U.S. Park Service National Monument, is one of the largest and most well preserved in North America. Courtesy USDA Forest ServiceMEANINGS OF THE FOUR DIRECTIONS Different tribes interpret the Medicine Wheel differently. Each of the Four Directions (East, South, West, and North) is typically represented by a distinctive color, such as black, red, yellow, and white, which for some stands for the human races. The Directions can also represent: Stages of life: birth, youth, adult (or elder), death Seasons of the year: spring, summer, winter, fall Aspects of life: spiritual, emotional, intellectual, physical Elements of nature: fire (or sun), air, water, and earth Animals: Eagle, Bear, Wolf, Buffalo and many others Ceremonial plants: tobacco, sweet grass, sage, cedarJourney to the Medicine Wheel, by Howard Terpning \u00ae, Terpning's painting captures the healing power of the Medicine Wheel as a Plains Indian family makes an offering at this sacred place. SPIRIT OF EAGLES MEDICINE WHEEL, BY CHHOLING TAHA, 2010 The four colors of man at the top are expressed in the form of pictograph thunderbirds or eagles, honoring the wisdom of all the Elders from all nations. The blue flowers in the border illustrate the many plant medicines Creator has left for man to heal the community, family and person. The light blue thunderbirds/eagles represent the positive influence the Spirit of the Ancestors (wisdom from experience) has from infancy to adulthood. The group of wigwams at the bottom speaks of the importance of community commitment and collaboration, the foundation for holding all people upright for healthy living. \u2014Chholing Taha, Cree Indian Artist Courtesy National Library of Medicine HERBALISM After thousands of years of people learning the best ways to take care of our health, now it is the scientific belief that our emotions as well as our spiritual health play a substantial role in our physical well being. Long before the Europeans arrived on the North American continent indigenous people were practicing herbalism. Some of their knowledge of how plants could be used for wellness came from their keen observation of the wildlife around them. They observed that deer, elk, and bear sought out plants to eat when they were sick. They saw the animals recover and knew to experiment with these herbs and plants, to heal themselves The indigenous tribes also worked and communed with plants and herbs believing that there was an exchange of healing information from the plants themselves that guided them through the process of selecting the right herbs and plants for healing. \"All plants are our brothers and sisters. They talk to us and if we listen, we can hear them.\" The vital energy that moves through the plant world is believed to be the same vital energy that moves through all of life on earth. Plants were carefully studied by the Native Americans over thousands of years contributing to the huge knowledge base of over 500 herbal plants. This plant and herbal knowledge learned and used by these early tribes was passed down orally for the most part as very little was written. Many herbs that were discovered and used by Native Americans are used today in the ways in which the Native American people used them. THE KEY ROLE OF CEREMONY Ceremony is an essential part of traditional Native healing. Because physical and spiritual health are intimately connected, body and spirit must heal together. Traditional healing ceremonies promote wellness by reflecting Native conceptions of Spirit, Creator, and the Universe. They can include prayer, chants, drumming, songs, stories, and the use of a variety of sacred objects. Healers may conduct ceremonies anywhere a sick person needs healing, but ceremonies are often held in sacred places. Special structures for healing are often referred to as Medicine Lodges. Wherever they take place, traditional healing ceremonies are considered sacred, and are only conducted by Native healers and Native spiritual facilitators. Non-Natives may participate by invitation only. In contrast, today, Native powwows have evolved into primarily social and cultural events that feature Native dancing, singing, drumming, regalia, and food. All people are welcome at most powwows. Medicine Ways: Traditional Healers and Healing HEALING PLANTS Native American, Alaska Native, and Native Hawaiian healers all have a long history of using indigenous, or native, plants for a wide variety of medicinal purposes. Medicinal plants and their applications are as diverse as the tribes who use them. Beyond their medicinal benefits, indigenous plants were a staple of Native people's diet before Western contact. Today, indigenous plants are central to efforts to improve dietary health for current generations. ZUNI HEALER GRINDING MEDICINE, EDWARD S. CURTIS, 1925. INCENSE OVER A MEDICINE BUNDLE , BY EDWARD S. CURTIS, 1908SOME OF THE NATIVE AMERICAN HERBS & THEIR USES The \" Sagebrush \" is a very powerful pain reliever. It is said to be much safer than NSAIDs and opioids. Apart from relieving pain, the pleasant smell of the \"California Sagebrush\" makes people relax. \"Spanish Bayonet \" plant has leaves and roots which give out some sort of soap. The fiber from its stems may be used in wounds. A plant called \" Chamise \" is used for skin problems. The \" California Bay \" is used for toothaches due to its anesthetic qualities. Skunk Cabbage was used by the \"Winnebago\" and \"Dakota Tribes\" to accelerate removal of phlegm in asthma. Horsemin t: The \"Catawba Tribe\" crushed and soaked fresh horsemint leaves in cold water and drank it to get rid of back pain.Creosote Bush : Its leaves were made into a tea and used for bronchial and other respiratory disorders. Devil's Club : Used by the Indians of British Columbia. They made tea out of the root bark to compensate for the effects of diabetes. Blackcherry : Used extensively by the Indians of North California, tea made of its roots is extremely useful for treatment of diarrhea. Pennyroyal: The \"Onondagas\" soaked its leaves and drank the tea to treat the headaches. AMERICAN GINSENG It was used to heal a variety of ailments, but it was also used for spiritual and ceremonial purposes. The Seneca used it for flu, fever, colds; sinus problems; to reduce swelling, and also as a laxative. The Iroquois, on the other hand, smoked the herb like tobacco The Seminole used it in sweat baths. Teas and tonics were made from the dried herb by several tribes for a variety of medicinal purposes (the Cherokee, Houma, Mohegan, Potawatomi and Creek tribes). ASPIRIN / SALICYLATES Aspirin is derived from salicin , a chemical in the inner bark of willow (and Aspen) trees that was used during ancient times for fever and pain. In topical form, it is generally considered safe, but can be lethal in high doses (I recommend buying it at the store, so you don't have a problem from it !) NOTE: The long article and comments from readers, have different opinions of using the inside bark vs using sections from branches to make a tea, so it doesn't damage the tree. https://home - remedies.wonderhowto.com/how - to/make -aspirin -from-willow -tree- 0142525/ THERE BASICALLY TYPES OF WILLOW TREES 1)Weeping Willow 2)The Black Willow3) The Golden Willow 4) The White Willow (which contains the most salicylic acid. All these species of tree contain the chemical we are looking for, in varying amounts. Although the white willow (or \"creek willow\" as some people call it) is the most potent, all of them will work. So, how do you identify it for sure? well, first you will need to look at the leaves. They should look about like this: Some of them are a little thicker, like this: CEREMONIES A number of healing ceremonies are performed according to a given patient situation. Some chants and rites for curing purposes include: The Blessing Way rite is usually done over pregnant women or any person for promoting good health and prosperity. The ceremony is the most frequently used one and resembles how the Holy People acted to create the world and establish harmony. The Enemy Way rite is done as an exorcism to remove ghosts, violence and negativity that can bring disease and do harm to host health and balance. The Night Way is a healing ceremony that takes course over nine days. Each day the patient is cleansed through a varying number of exercises done to attract holiness or repel evil in the form of exorcisms, sweat baths, and sand painting ceremonies. On the final day the one who is sung over inhales the \"breath of dawn\" and is deemed cured. TRADITIONAL HEALING PRACTICES INCLUDE: Sweat Lodge Smudging and purification Talking Circle Songs and drumming Red Road teachings Native art and crafts Storytelling Cultural presentations Positive Indian Parenting Circle of Strength Gathering of Native Americans (GONA) 1)MEDICINE MAN OR SHAMAN This is a tremendous tremor when considering Native American customs. The names of Healers a mong the tribes, change sequentially in time, and their natural habitat, surrounding animals and the direction that takes the name appear. Those who have been named \"Medicine Man\" are at the vital top of this rich cultural heritage and a tremendous effort is being made to preserve them even today. Holy men, or medical men (also known as shamans), are symbols of many traditions and are of equivalent status to priests. They were the therapists. They would practice many different rituals to anyone who suffered, without realizing what disease it was. 2) TOTEM ANIMAL One of the most important Native American beliefs was that every human being was influenced and inherited by the power or existence of an animal; for example an eagle, wolf or bear. This was one of the most important sources of inspiration in determining the character of a tribe, and it also led to great controversy and superstitions. One of the more popular beliefs was that tribal members accepted a name as their guardian angel or power to guide their spirits. Many sources show that there is a strong link between animal symbolism and astrology. This is a feature seen in many different cultures and shows us how much importance is given to Native American traditions, culture, nature influence and the value assigned to them. 3) NATIVE AMERICAN DANCES Native American celebrations were symbolized by grand ritual dances. A modern example of this can be shown as the song \"Pow Wow\". Male and female tribal Members were involved in dancing on important occasions, such as a won battle celebration. Dancing played a very important role in tribal life. This was a great way of showing happiness and joy (born after a wedding or a good corn harvest, for example). It was believed to improve the method to be used, and in the fight against patients. The courage of men in battle was demonstrated by dances shown in battle scenes. 4) SAND PAINTINGS Sand painting is the transfer of strength and beauty to the patient through various drawings made by a medicine man in the surrounding sand during a ceremony. Elaborate figures are drawn in the sand using colorful crushed minerals and plants. Many sand paintings contain depictions of spiritual yeii (special spirits) to whom a medicine man will ask to come into the painting in order for patient healing to occur. After each ceremony, the sacred sand painting is destroyed . 5) SPLENDID SPIRIT Wakan -Taka was everywhere, within man and at the center of the universe. This was what all Native American tribes believed most heartfelt and included Father Heaven, Great Spirit Mother, and Mother Nature. Until the morning, men and women would thank the Master of Life for their life donated to them that day. Their belief in the blessed circle is symbolized by the Earth's rotation directive, meal elements and stars; it was all associated with the Great Spirit. The Indians of the Plains believed in this power in exchange for its power over animals, sight, clouds, stones, after all, the Earth was passing its light and heat through the sun with its unimaginable power. Again, according to Hopi Pueblo, power was given by the Spirit to the Shaman or Medicine Man \u2014so these people would interpret not only sickness as healing, but also spirits and dreams. 6) KACHINA DOLL Representing the spirit of Hopi, these dolls were basically prepared as gifts for tribal children, and they all had a different meaning and significance. According to Native American traditions, the Ka\u00e7Hinas carried the holy spirits that roamed San Francisco and the outskirts of Arizona. In ceremonial events, the masked Hopi Pueblos symbolized the spirits and distributed these dolls to the children with candy and different styles of toys among traditional dances. Escapes were considered the spirits of gods, animals, or deceased tribesmen known for their special powers 7) DREAM CATCHER This talisman was created by Ojibwa to teach the wisdom of nature. From the earliest times, dream catchers have been knitted from natural materials (such as feathers and threads) and the newborn experiment is hung on their heads so that they can have a peaceful sleep full of wonderful dreams. According to Native American traditions, the night air was full of dreams. Beautiful dreams would understand the way to the dreamer with the movements of the hairs in the trap. Your bad dreams would be confused in the trap. They could not find their way so they would disappear into the day -born absence. HEALING AND ART The creative arts have a special place in Native healing and wellness. Some artworks are specifically focused on healing, but ceremonies and objects that serve other purposes can also have a healing aspect. In healing ceremonies, the arts play a direct role in the healing process, and paintings such as the ones in this collection also help keep traditions alive for new generations. The Native artists represented here draw from a long history of painting on pottery, hides, and other materials as well as creating pictographs and petroglyphs. The diversity of styles and subjects reflects the diversity of healing practices and health issues faced by different Native groups. THE SACRED MEDICINE BUNDLE Native Americans use a sacred medicine bundle for religious purposes. It is a wrapped package that contains a collection of various items such as seeds, pinecones, beads, tobacco, arrowheads, grass, animal teeth or claws, rocks, crystals, bones and other small things that might have a spiritual significance to the keeper of the bundle. The tribal community generally consider the contents of the bundle to be sacred, and the items are not meant to touch the ground. Medicine bundles are sometimes passed down from one generation to another, although some bundles, considered to be a precious possession, are buried with the owner upon his death. .\"OPENING THE SACRED BUNDLE.\" AN OIL PAINTING BY HOWARD TERPNINGSMUDGING WITH SAGE Native Americans use this to call on the spirits of sacred plants to drive away negative energies and restore balance.
