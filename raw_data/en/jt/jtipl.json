Hello, I have been meditating for over a year now. Daily meditator, I am very religious with my practice. Every morning I do half hour meditation followed by a teaching from the monk who is guiding us. Typical meditation, breath focused, sometimes a kindness focused meditation. I am just not sure if this is actually healthy for me. I mean I feel that all humans are capable of enlightenment, but I feel the monks have it easy, so to speak. They have cut themselves off from society, they don't have to deal with the troubles of developing a career, meeting a spouse, buying a home, and dealing with the daily stresses of all those things mentioned. Sure, I could become enlightened too if I just gave up my life in society and moved into the monastery. I just don't know what I am trying to achieve with meditation. I was assuming that I would just be more present. The Buddha's teachings, I feel are not directed toward young people who are trying to get corporate jobs and live a \"normal\" life... The whole getting rid of the ego thing scares me. I mean I am young, I haven't even really fully developed an ego, so to speak, like a career, family etc. The teachings seem to want to have the self die off. Instead I want to create myself, build myself up. I feel a little bit of ego is healthy. I don't want complete nothingness like these teachings seem to be saying. I want to be mindful, yes. But I want to live a fulfilling life IN society. I want to be successful, start a business, build generational wealth for my future family. It seems the monks are taking the easy way out and just escaping society. That in my opinion is not a good philosophy. How do I come to terms with meditation and not feel like I am some Alan Watts type dude who just wants to sit in the woods all day and smoke a pipe (although that does sound pretty badass). Women my age aren't attracted to Nothingness, they want a REAL man who can be strong, courageous, compassionate and goal driven, these women don't want some hippie dude who just wants to kill his ego and be nothingness. If I keep going on this meditation journey, I fear I will never meet a beautiful woman, or get a successful career, or all the other things \"normal\" people do. If you read this, I really appreciate your feedback. "}
