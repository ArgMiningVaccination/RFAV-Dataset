New features added: Added user on-boarding screens. Support your favourite websites by whitelisting them. We've also included a Safari Extension for quick & easy whitelisting ;) Also includes Acceptable Ads, an optional feature to show your support for better advertising. Graphics have been overhauled across the app so it has a more pleasing aesthetic. Also I rewrote the sync engine to be more efficient and less error prone. Enjoying Crystal? It'll be great if you could leave a rating or review :) This is only a teaser of what's to come ;) Ratings and Reviews Sorta Works I bought this expecting it to be a waste of money and it was only half a waste because it only does about half its job. The non-intrusive ads are still there even when the option to block them is \"on\"; but the tab changing ads are, in fact, reduced but not fully extinct. I kept this app to see how well it does in the future hoping my $.99 was enough to keep the ball rolling for these people to make a better product for us all. Only time will tell now. Works even on TMZ... Just installed this and blocked all ads in preferences. I'm still in iOS 9. Tried it on the most impossibly ad-infested site I know : the TMZ tabloid site. TMZ has been practically unreadable for years because of all the pathological ads (used to be normal). With Crystal - it was completely readable, no agonizing slowdown and glitchiness. Before, I had to use a separate browser (Adblock) if there was anything I wanted to read on TMZ. Now I can read it within Safari, no problem. Will be testing other occasionally glitchy sites (all those ads are really a problem), but TMZ is definitely the gold standard for testing ad blockers. Consistently Good I've used Crystal for over a year, and it has always functioned exactly as advertised. Unlike a number of other content blockers, Crystal's developer has not abandoned this app, but has instead continued to update and improve it (including regular blocklist updates). This latest version also includes the oft-requested whitelisting feature. I really don't understand the hatred that is being directed towards this developer because of the new \"acceptable ads\" setting. If you don't want to allow these adverts, just turn them off in the app\u2014it's that simple!
