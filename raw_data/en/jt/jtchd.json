But recovery starts here. Doctors and medical scientists agree that the vaccine is the quickest, safest and most effective way to keep our communities safe from the virus. We understand that many people have questions and concerns, which is why we're here to give you the facts so you can make a confident, informed decision for yourself. Thank you so much for taking the time to learn about the vaccine. We're all ready for a new day. And it starts here. With you. People who get the vaccine are protected from getting severe cases of COVID-19. Scientists are learning more every day about how many people will need to get the vaccine in order for communities to achieve 'community immunity,' which is when enough people are vaccinated that our communities are safe. The more people who get the vaccine, the closer we are to doing the things we love again: spending time with family; celebrating birthdays and graduations; and going to large public events like sports games or church. But regardless of the proven benefits, we know that getting the vaccine is a personal choice that each person must make on their own. That's why we're here - addressing the most-common concerns by presenting you with the facts, so that you can feel confident about making the choice that's right for you. FACT: Almost all side effects from the COVID-19 vaccine are short term and mild - not serious or dangerous. The COVID-19 vaccine cannot and will not give you COVID-19; nor does it inject the live COVID-19 virus into your body. Like with most vaccines, some people say they felt body aches, headaches, pain where they got the shot, or a fever for a day or two after receiving the COVID-19 vaccine. These side effects are common with most vaccines, because they are a sign that the vaccine is making your immune system work. If you have allergies - especially severe ones that require you to carry an EpiPen\u00ae - discuss the COVID-19 vaccine with a doctor who can assess your risk and provide more information about if and how you can get vaccinated safely. FACT: The vaccine is offered at no cost. The COVID-19 vaccine will be offered at no cost, whether you're on Medicare, are on Medicaid, have private health insurance or are uninsured. Some vaccination locations may charge a small facility fee for giving the shot, but the vaccine itself is offered at no cost. This fee is covered by most insurances and for uninsured patients. FACT: Clinical research overwhelmingly shows that COVID-19 vaccines are safe for people of color. Coronavirus vaccine trials have worked to distance themselves from the legacy of racial injustice in medicine by recruiting a perse group of volunteers. Moderna, one of the pharmaceutical companies with an authorized vaccine, even slowed down its coronavirus vaccine trial in September 2020 to allow more time for volunteers of color to join. Not only were there people of color on the teams of scientists and researchers developing the vaccines, but also the Moderna trial included 2,698 Black volunteers and 5,563 Hispanic volunteers. The global trial for Pfizer, another company with an approved vaccine included 3,947 Black volunteers, 10,553 Hispanic volunteers, 1,772 Asian volunteers and 242 Native American volunteers. Johnson & Johnson tested about 45,000 people around the world including more than 1,300 Asian volunteers, more than 8,500 Black volunteers, more than 20,000 Hispanic volunteers and more than 4,000 Native American volunteers. As of [March 1, 2021] 250 million people of all races from around the world have been vaccinated safely. FACT: No shortcuts were taken in research or the testing and approval process. The emergency nature of the COVID-19 pandemic required the testing and approval process for these vaccines to occur quickly, but the trials were not rushed in any way. Scientists all around the world worked together to develop the vaccines that are now being used safely all over the globe. All available vaccines went through a Phase 3 trial which is the final testing phase for all new drugs. More than 115,000 people participated in these trials. Politicians, investors and anyone else who is not a researcher or medical scientist cannot do anything to influence the results. The results are sent to outside scientists who work independently to make recommendations and decide whether or not to authorize a vaccine. FACT: All available vaccines are effective at protecting against mild and severe symptoms of COVID-19. Pfizer and Moderna report 95 percent effectiveness. The Johnson & Johnson vaccine has proven to be 75 percent effective. In clinical trials, all three vaccines have been found to be highly effective at preventing symptomatic infection from COVID-19. A report by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) shows that the Pfizer two-dose vaccine is about 95 percent effective against COVID-19, the Moderna two-dose vaccine is about 95 percent effective against COVID-19, and the Johnson & Johnson one-dose vaccine is about 75 percent effective against COVID-19 in people regardless of age, race or other risks for severe illness from an infection. All vaccines were also found to be highly effective at preventing hospitalizations and deaths from COVID-19. Doctor Anthony Fauci, Director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, says that keeping patients out of the hospital is \"one of the important things you want to do\" in the fight against COVID-19. FACT: The vaccines contain mRNA and other natural things found in the human body Two of the COVID-19 vaccines authorized by the FDA contain mRNA, which is a natural part of the human body that instructs the body how to produce proteins. Other, normal vaccine ingredients, such as fats (which protect the mRNA), salts and a small amount of sugar are also present in the vaccine. The COVID-19 vaccine gives our bodies instructions on how to make one specific type of protein that activates the immune system to help it fight COVID-19. FACT: The idea of using mRNA in vaccines has been in development for almost 20 years. mRNA is a natural part of the human body. It gives the body instructions on how to produce proteins. Before mRNA, vaccines put a small amount of weakened or dead virus into the body to teach the immune system how to protect itself. The mRNA vaccine actually teaches the body how to make a small piece of protein that trains the immune system in the same way. Vaccine makers have been working on this type of treatment for a long time because it's one of the most effective ways to respond quickly to a new pandemic illness like COVID-19. FACT: For all inpiduals, the COVID-19 vaccine provides the best, most reliable protection against COVID-19. Even people who have recovered from COVID-19 can become reinfected with the virus. The vaccination provides a higher degree of immunity than previous COVID-19 infection. Doctors and medical scientists do not know how long someone is protected after recovery, so it's still important for everyone who wants to be protected against COVID-19 to get vaccinated. FACT: All three currently available vaccines are safe and effective at preventing COVID-19. Here is a brief summary of each available vaccine. In phase 3 trials, all vaccines were 100 percent effective at preventing hospitalization. FACT: Two doses of the Pfizer and Moderna COVID-19 vaccines are necessary to be fully protected against the virus. The second shot of the vaccine almost doubles the level of protection against COVID-19. Scientists are still studying how long the lower level of immunity from one shot lasts, so just getting one dose of the vaccine is not enough. In order to get the full benefits of the COVID-19 vaccine, everyone needs to get both shots. "}
