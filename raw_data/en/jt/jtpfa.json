Meditate and manifest through the ancient practice of Galdr - a part of the old Nordic Sei\u00f0r practice - what we today call Nordic shamanism. Emma combines her intuition, her craft & the energy healing in her singing as she calls on the elements to manifest & help people connect to their path, purpose & spirit guides. Her sessions are shamanic journeys - the Nordic way; singing blessings into being; music manifestation combined with sound healing in the form of sacred song. 75-90 min Private/$150 75-90 min Class/$60 (Max 15 people per class) \"Universal Life Force Energy.\" The Spiritual healing art of energy healing works by channeling positive energy into your body through the healers hands. Sessions are done hands-on or hands-above. This intelligent energy will flow to the areas of the body that need it the most. This healing technique is based on the principle that the therapist can channel life force energy, or Chi, to activate the body's natural healing processes and restore physical and emotional well-being. 60-75 min/$125 During this session, the healer will channel energy and also use Quartz Crystal Sound Bowls that are tuned to the frequencies of the chakras. The tones of the bowls literally vibrate all of the cells, which helps to cleanse and clear them. 60-75 min/$145 During this session, the client and healer will first talk about what areas of their life they would like guidance on. Then the energy healing portion will occur. After this the client and healer will chat again to see what came up for them, what \"a-ha's\" or insights they had during the session, and then will receive some Spiritual Life Coaching. 60-75 min/$200 The focus on this session will be to open up and rebalance the chakras if needed, make sure they are spinning in the right direction, cleanse and clear them, and increase their energy. If sound bowls or crystals are needed for part of the session, we will use them. We will also use a pendulum to check both before and after the session how the chakras are doing. 60-75 min/$175 This session is designed to provide a clear and loving connection between mind, body & soul. We will first consult and identify your areas of concern. We will then use a guided visualization technique called Focusing a body-oriented process of self-awareness and emotional healing that engages the senses to heal the body & mind connection. From there we will begin the energy healing portion that will be intuitively done specific to your needs. These sessions include the use of energy healing, aromatherapy, guided breath-work, sound therapy (tuning forks & crystal sound bowls), and energetic clearing. This promotes the healing of your nervous system which is key to overall health and welling. 75 min/$200 This session is designed for youth, kids, teens of all ages! They will lay or sit comfortably and relaxed during the session and close their eyes. Soothing music will be played. The session will be done hands-above by the energy healer. Energy sessions are helpful for youth to help them relax, reduce stress and anxiety, to feel more calm and balanced, and to help with focus by calming the mind. 30 min/$65 We will be offering Level 1. 4-hours/$250 *Appointment Cancellation Policy: As we are working to heal many people, FOY Life is kindly asking that should you need to cancel an appointment, please be mindful to give 24-hour notice of your scheduled services in order to avoid a late cancellation fee.
