The Green Paper is not a policy, nor a draft policy , but a step in the policy process. By definition, a Green Paper is a report initiated by the Government regarding the formulation of a policy. A Green Paper issued by th e European Commission is a document in which certain ideas are enumerated with the intention of initiating further debate and consultation. It usually leads t o the launching of a series of consultative steps that may lead to a policy. In th e Commonwealth, the Republic of Ireland, and the United States a Green Paper is a t entative Government report of a proposal, which, in the case of Mauritius would be the pursuit of a Sustainable Mauritius. A Green Paper may result in the producti on of a White Paper which, when endorsed by Cabinet, becomes the policy (see S ection 4.4 for further explanation). The Green Paper is entitled, \" Towards a National Policy for a Sustainable Mauritius\" . It is an important milestone in the ongoing polic y process, approved by Cabinet in December 2009, with the national cons ultations launched by the Deputy Prime Minister, Minister of Energy and Publi c Utilities, Dr. The Honourable A.R. Beebeejaun, on 19 February 2010. Al though the consultative process was interrupted by the national elections o f May 2010, the pursuit of a Sustainable Mauritius continued in many ways and fo rms, including a High Level Workshop held in December 2010. It is now ready to be resumed in full force. The Green Paper summarises the initial stages of the po licy formation process, including valuable lessons learned, and by doing so provides a basis for further consultation and actions leading to policy. The Green Paper, because it has to be short and eas y to consume, contains only a summary of the most important results of the nation al consultations. The document, \" Annexes to the Green Paper\" contains more summary results, certain project documents, and information on how the proce ss was run, including organising and overseeing bodies, details of meetin gs held, and how data were analysed. The Green Paper is intended to further stimulate di scussion and input. Making it available to all and anyone who wish to read it, no t only testifies to the transparency of the process, but is also the only r eal way to test if it accurately captured the diverse input from Government Ministri es as well as civil society. It not only presents results but also suggestions for the process ahead based on international best practice, the overall formulatio n process already approved by Cabinet in December 2009, and 'lessons learned' du ring Phase 1.

Sustainable d evelopment has now firmly emerged as the paradigm in which our cou ntry's future is rooted, particularly since the Prime Minister, D r. The Honourable Navinchandra RAMGOOLAM, GCSK, FRCP launched the concept of Maurice Ile Durable in 2008. Having in place a dedicated Ministry of Environment and Susta inable Development is in itself indicative of Government's priorities. The Maurice Ile Durable concept spawned a number of noteworthy initiatives. In June 2008, the Maurice Ile Durable Fund (MIDF) was set up under the aegis of the then Ministry of Renewable Energy and Public Utilities as an instrument to pro mote sustainable development in the country. Soon it became clear th at our pursuit of a sustainable country required a policy to consolidate all efforts in our quest for a Sustainable Mauritius. A General Facilitator in the person of Professor Francois Ode ndaal was recruited for the first stages of the development of the National Policy for a Sustainabl e Mauritius. I have great pleasure in launching the Green Paper for a Sustainable Mauritius. The document summarises the policy formulation process up until this point. Not only does the Green Paper reconfirm Government's commitment to the involvemen t of all our people in a matter that lies at the core of our island's well-being - it also displ ays a high level awareness amongst the public and stakeholders of the need and urgency for Maurit ius to be on a sustainable trajectory. Everything that is written in the Green Paper does not necessarily reflect the views of my Ministry. In the proud tradition of our democracy t he Green Paper publishes a concise version of amalgamated input, as they were given by the people and other Ministries and parastatal bodies. The promise was made that such input would be publi shed. Now we can move ahead, analysing and reworking input obtained thus far, and even cal l for further input, including through structured thematic workshops - up to the point whe re Government will be able to confidently endorse a policy that will benefit our country for many years to come. Valuable lessons learned during this first phase of the policy formulation p rocess can now also be usefully applied to provide the proper orientation for the huge task th at lies ahead. Making policy is about forging the way forward, and the current policy process will consider a wide range of fundamentally important imperatives i n our quest for a sustainable Mauritius. The Green Paper again shows that we have made a solid s tart, and the Draft National Vision that is in it, will serve as a beacon along our way. I encoura ge all and everyone to continue to be part of vii this landmark policy process. After all, it is our quality of life and the future of our country that is at stake. Phase 1 of the policy process revolved around the n ational consultations which will continue during the next phase. The promise was made that ev ery Mauritian who wished to participate will get the chance to do so. Phase 2 will focus on the writing of the policy itself. The results of Phase 1 would be enriched by expert input obtained from working groups, expert analysis of the legal and institutional framework, and specialist s tudies when they may be needed. Again there will be further opportunities for participation, wh ich is the hallmark of a democratic society. I conclude by extending my appreciation to the Depu ty Prime Minister, Minister of Energy and Public Utilities, who had driven the process up so far. In addition, I would like to point out that the Steering Committee set up at the Prime Minister 's Office has been and will continue to be instrumental in the whole process of having a MID v ision, Policy, Strategy and Action Plan. Finally, I would like to thank the United Nations D evelopment Programme for the important role it has played in supporting the process. Honourable Devanand VIRAHSAWMY, GOSK, FCCA Minister of Environment and Sustainable Development viii Note from the General Facilitator Government priorities cannot be dictated by experts . In a country with proud democratic traditions such as Mauritius, policy making is a Go vernment led process that makes provision for the involvement of all parties. Therefore, under th e leadership of Government, a number of entities were invited to participate in the design of the methodology before it was officialised. The result was a policy formulation process that is both transparent and credible. Consultations could start, and input would be ongoing until the p olicy was finalised. The role of the General Facilitator was to solicit input and then pull together the results in a short, simple and succinct way so that all and ever yone could understand them. I am deeply honoured and humbled to have played such a role in a country that I admire deeply, and in doing so have learned a great deal about my fellow Maurit ians, their dreams, needs and aspirations - these I tried to reflect as best as I can in this G reen Paper. As General Facilitator of the first phase I was deeply moved by the passion Mauritians have for our little island. Writing the Green Paper was a mammoth task, one tha t required going through thousands of pages of submissions, documents and notes. As the G reen Paper is intended as a summary document of the policy process so far, I had to cut down on its content brutally. The accompanying document, \" Annexes to the Green Paper\", contains much more information. It should be studied by those who will be driving the policy formulation process further. Re- analysis of sections of the overall dataset may rev eal further trends, though I believe the main points in the Green Paper will be unchanged. There are so many individuals and parties in Govern ment and Civil Society that it is simply not possible to acknowledge them all. They include nume rous Government officials and politicians, NGOs, the academic establishment, the business comm unity, networks and Special Interest Groups, local communities and an assortment of peop le at ground level. They made a vivid impression on me as a collective voice of our beaut iful Mauritius. May their voices count and make the difference they had hoped to make. The Deputy Prime Minister, Dr. The Honourable Beebe ejaun's enthusiasm and support was prevalent throughout the national consultations. We were always able to rely on his guidance. The Permanent Secretary, Mrs Nababsing, and her sta ff provided backup in a process that was new to all of us. This was not always easy, and we all learned much along the way. The PMO Steering Committee did the needful in coordinating input from the Ministries. ix The consultation process would have never occurred without the Prime Minister Dr. The Honourable Navinchandra Ramgoolam having taken the bold and unprecedented step in bringing the Maurice Ile Durable concept to the nation. In doing so, the Prime Mini ster has already fulfilled part of the vision proposed at the Nation al Youth Summit for a Sustainable Mauritius, that is, to not only put our small island on a sust ainable trajectory but \"....to serve as a model of sustainable development for the world\" .

Never before has it been as necessary and as urgent for Mauritius to review the directions in which the country is moving. Profound and far-reaching changes are sweeping across the globe, some of them forerunners of future shocks that will dramatically impact on the quality of life. Intense unfavourable impacts are already being felt at the local level in many countries and Mauritius should by no means consider itself immune. Resource depletion, climate change, overpopulation, diminishing conventional energy source, deforestati on, pollution on land and sea, rising poverty world-wide, and political instabilit y, are only some of the factors that we now need to confront, and hopefully can overcome . 2. As a Small Island Developing State (SIDS), Mauritiu s is exceptionally vulnerable. It faces similar threats to its survival as other SIDS , which include, inter alia , a strong reliance on a depleting natural resource base, loss of biodiversity and degradation of essential components of the ecosystem, and a heavy dependency on fossil fuels and other imported commodities that support society. Cl imate change, the long distances that separate Mauritius from Africa and Asia, coupl ed with rising fuel costs exacerbate the situation considerably. Unless substantial and effective interventions are put in place soonest, the current and future generations m ay not be able to meet their needs. 3. Mauritius is responding to the global and national challenge of achieving sustainable development through the implementation of the Maurice Ile Durable concept that was brought to the nation by the Prime Minister of the Republic of Mauritius, Dr. The Hon. Navinchandra Ramgoolam, GCSK, in 2008, as a long te rm vision for the sustainable development of our country. However, it was soon re alised that, in order to formalise a coherent and coordinated response to the formidable challenges that we face, a comprehensive and overarching National Policy for a Sustainable Mauritius will be required, a policy that is accompanied by a MID Str ategy and MID Action Plan. 4. The formulation of the policy comes at the right ti me. The comprehensive National Environmental Strategies for the Republic of Maurit ius: National Environmental Action Plan for the Next Decade was published in 1999. In the subsequent decade ou r country has seen unprecedented economic growth, bri nging benefits to many people while at the same time putting additional strain on our resources. While there are many plans and policies that govern our development, the re exists not a single document that addresses all pillars of sustainable development in the same integrated manner that the current policy will aim to do, and none that will h ave the same solid grounding in public consultation and expert opinion. xii 5. True to our democratic tradition that evolved since Independence, and in line with the principles of good governance, a policy formulation process was designed with the involvement of a range of parties, including civil society, the private sector, Government bodies, NGOs and Special Interest Groups . The aim of the policy, together with the strategy and action plan would be to attain \"a situation in which the needs of the present generation are met, without je opardising the chances of future generations to meet theirs\". The policy process was endorsed by Cabinet in 2009, and the nation participated enthusiastically in the sho rt time made available before the oncoming 2010 elections called for a recess in publ ic consultation. 6. The Green Paper comes at the end of Phase 1, and su mmarises the policy formulation process up to this point, in particular the results of the national consultations that were launched in February 2010. Ministries, Special Inte rest Groups and civil society at large were consulted through a variety of methods, including a National Youth Summit that was held in April 2010. The national co nsultations yielded rich results, summarised in section 6, which is testimony of a so ciety that has a good grasp of what the pursuit of a Sustainable Mauritius would entail . Input can now be examined in- depth during thematic workshops to be held in Phase 2 of the policy process, while a Draft National Vision may function as a guiding lig ht on the road that lies ahead. 7. A wide range of issues were identified that relate to the conventional three dimensions of sustainability, namely the economy, environment, and social issues. Most significantly, and rather unexpectedly, a fourth on e dimension, namely governance, was identified in the classification of issues: Proportion of views expressed by the population cla ssified into the four categories Sectors Score Percentage Environment 2978 Economy 9765 100% 8. The four dimensions of sustainable development can be further divided into thirty-six themes, out of which eighteen were identified as pr iority themes after analysis. They are all deemed important and worthy of in-depth exp loration, especially when it comes to identifying discrete actions and programmes for the MID Action Plan. The xiii breakdown of input into the priority themes is show n in the figure below (note again the high percentage attributed to governance issue s): Breakdown of input into the priority themes xiv 9. One message that clearly stands out from Phase 1 is that the needs and aspirations of the people, and their National Vision, do not diffe r significantly from how Government views sustainability and how the Ministr ies see their mandates in relation to sustainable pursuits. Coordination, transparency and integrated governance are at the top of the list of good governance indicators t hat were discussed. Without integrated governance it will be very difficult if not impossible to bal ance the needs and mandates of different sectors which, when viewe d on their own, all have valid reasons to take priority. Finding the balance and s olutions will require an overarching, coordinating and legal and integrated framework, wh ich is what may be expected from the National Policy for a Sustainable Mauritius. 10. Institutional analysis and legal review can greatly improve the efficacy of the Government machinery. Without better mechanisms of coordination and cooperative decision making, integrated development planning or devolution of powers to lower tiers of governments, will remain difficult. Fortun ately, achieving higher levels of good governance should not be too difficult in a co untry that has the highest scores for governance in Africa. Thorough institutional analys is and legal review ought to reveal what adjustments, additions and potential instituti onal reforms (they are expected to be small but nonetheless very important) may be necess ary to make Government stronger in pursuing integrated solutions and in making deci sions that will achieve better balances when economic, social and environmental, a nd even cultural issues are at play. 11. A Draft National Vision emanated from the National Youth Summit (see section 9). There is also a longer Draft Combined National Visi on that is made up from all the draft visions from the different meetings. It is pr oposed that the two visions are published in the press for further comment. This wi ll confirm that all Mauritians had a chance to contribute to the National Vision. Vision ing exercises must continue with the further consultations proposed in section 10. W hen all comments and draft visions have been collected the Draft National Vision can b e further refined. It will then be included in the Draft White Paper, which effectivel y is the Draft Policy. When the White Paper is endorsed by Cabinet as the National Policy for a Sustainable Mauritius, the National Vision will be embedded in it. 12. A gap analysis of the policy formulation process up until the Green Paper reveals suggestions that may be usefully applied to the imp lementation of Phase 2. The Policy will relate strongly to governance issues and overa ll directions, while the Strategy may be expected to define discreet areas of interventio n, and an Action Plan with budget that will describe actions and indicate how much in vestment will be needed in the coming years to achieve a Sustainable Mauritius. xv 13. It is stressed that the policy process as approved by Cabinet must be strictly adhered to, up to the point where the White Paper is endors ed as the National Policy for a Sustainable Mauritius. The necessary institutional analyses and legal review should not wait until the policy is already in an advanced stage; all consultations have pointed very clearly to the need for a legal review and imp roved institutional relationships that will lead to higher levels of integrated governance. Deviations and ad hoc alterations to the process, including pre-determined thematic w orkshops that do not strongly correlate with the input of the people (see also se ction 11.3) must be avoided. Deviations can lead to suboptimal results and may i nadvertently damage the integrity of a landmark process that can rightly be described as a remarkable example of Government planning with the people. All gaps in the consultation process as initially planned should be filled. Only then can ownership b e fully shared by all Mauritians, and will this be a policy that belongs to all of us . 1 1 Introduction Change is a common feature of life on Earth. Over t he last few decades it has become abundantly clear that there are profound and far-re aching changes, some of them irreversible, that at best will have an impact on o ur way of life, and at worst threaten our very existence as a human race. It is common knowle dge that it is not only the magnitude, but also the rate of global and local ch anges that are cause for alarm. Resource depletion, climate change, overpopulation, diminishing conventional energy sources, deforestation, pollution on land and sea, rising poverty world-wide, and political instability, are only some of the factors that has led to unprecedented challenges that we now need to confront, and hopefully overcome. One of the largest and most significant responses o f the international community was the United Nations Conference on Environment and Develo pment (UNCED), also known as the Rio Summit, or Earth Summit, held in Rio de Janeiro in June 1992. In spite of several internati onal conventions that resulted from the conference in which 172 countries participated, the overall situation worsened over the subsequent decade leading up to the World Summit on Sustainable Development (WSSD), held in Johannesburg in 2002. Further stocktaking revealed a world in need of sustainable solutions more than ever before in human history, and that the time for taking action is running out fast 1. Recent years have seen a large number of global and national responses. Mauritius now comes with a comprehensive and integrated sustainab le development policy that aims to integrate the aspirations of Mauritians and the env ironmental constraints in which the country operates, taking into account economic, env ironmental, social and cultural parameters. To pursue sustainability requires coura ge and boldness. Sacrifices, where necessary, changes in habits, and new priorities in how resources are allocated, do not come automatically: \"It is in all our interest that we change our mindset, leave our 1 The Brundtland Commission, formally the World Commi ssion on Environment and Development (WCED), was convened by the United Nations in 1983 already. The commission was created to address growing concern \"about the accelerating deterioration of the human environ ment and natural resources and the consequences of that deterioration for economic and social development.\" The commission coined what has become the most oft en- quoted definition of sustainable development as development that \"meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to m eet their own needs.\" In 1988, UNESCO integrated cu lture into sustainable development. \"We're the first generation with tools to understand changes in the Earth's system caused by human activity, and the last with the opportunity to influence the course of many of the changes now rapidly under way\" (Vitousek et al . 1997). 2 comfort zones, forget the easy options and think in terms of sustainable development in unison, as one people\" 2. Policy can guide how we address development needs i n our growing nation, and firmly embed it into our way of life and how we do busines s. Mauritius has done well since independence (see 'Economic Miracle in the Indian O cean', Section 3.2). We want to do even better, and at the same time ensure that our country is firmly placed on a sustainable trajectory, for the benefit of present and future generations. An integrated policy will go a long way in helping our nation to adapt to future circumstances. Already it is clear that the youth of today will live in a very different world from the one we are used to, and to ensure a good future for them we have to act now. 2 What is the National Policy for a Sustainable Ma uritius? 2.1 The Maurice Ile Durable concept The policy formulation process has its origins from the Maurice Ile Durable (MID) concept, which was launched in 2008 by the Prime Mi nister of the Republic of Mauritius, Dr. The Honourable Navinchandra Ramgoolam, GCSK, as a long term vision for the sustainable development of our country. The main objective of the Mauritius Ile Durable (MID) concept was to make Mauritius a world model of sustainable development, particularly in the context of Small Island Developing States (SIDS). While the initial thrust was to minimize our dependency on fossil fuels through increased utilization of renewable energy and a more efficien t use of energy in general, the concept soon widened to include all aspects of the economy, society and the environment that are considered to be pivotal in the pursuit of a sustai nable Mauritius. In June 2008, the Maurice Ile Durable Fund (MIDF) was set up under th e aegis of the then Ministry of Renewable Energy and Public Utilities (MREPU) as an instrument to promote sustainable development in the country. 2 Statement by the Prime Minister, Dr the Hon. Navinc handra Ramgoolam, at the Maurice Ile Durable, High Level Workshop, 1-2 December 2010. What is Sustainability? Sustainability refers to a situation where the present generation can meet its needs, without jeopardising the chances of future generations to meet theirs. What is Policy? Public policy can be generally defined as a set of guidelines, a deliberate course of action taken by governmental entities with regard to a particular issue or set of issues, in this case the sustainable development of Mauritius. 3 Once in the public area, the concept of Maurice Ile Durable gave rise to a groundswell of interest and comment. Soon it became clear that it was both necessary and urgent to crystallize, substantiate, and formalise the MID co ncept into a national policy that would consolidate the Maurice Ile Durable concept and plo t a clear way ahead and guide decisions by which rational outcomes can be achieve d. 2.2 Why the National Policy for a Sustainable Mauri tius is necessary Mauritius is a small, isolated island located 600 k m east of Madagascar. It is located some 2000 km from the African mainland, and even fu rther from the Indian subcontinent. Its geographical isolation coupled with its small s ize makes Mauritius particularly vulnerable in terms of natural disasters, food secu rity and rising fuel costs. The current economic meltdown has already made its effects felt across the globe and Mauritius is no exception. Future shocks may very well have far-rea ching effects on the quality of life of the people of Mauritius. Mauritius is a Small Island Developing States (SIDS ) and faces similar threats to its survival as other SIDS, which include, inter alia , a strong reliance on a depleting natural resource base, loss of biodiversity and degradation of essential components of the ecosystem, and a heavy dependency on fossil fuels a nd other imported commodities that support society. Climate change and rising fuel cos ts exacerbate the situation. Without careful planning and sustainability interventions, the country may not have the necessary resilience to recover from future shocks, and polic y can help to guide and prepare us to absorb, mitigate and in some cases avoid future sho cks entirely. Food security is one example. Mauritius is far from being sustainable when it comes to the food the nation consumes. According to the Food Security Strategic Plan for 2008 to 2011, Mauritius imports around 70% of its food comm odities 3. Government is implementing several measures to address the issue of food security in Mauritius. One is to cooperate with countries in the region where opp ortunities arise to produce food crops, livestock and marine products for domestic consumpt ion, as well as for the regional markets. Yet price hikes, slumps in global food sup ply and climate change are considered real risks that our country faces as a net food imp orter. The greatest threats to economic and environmental sustainability lie in our dependency on oil and petroleum based energy, the extensive tr ansformation of natural habitats, and the degradation of 43% of our land resource due to extensive monoculture practice, primarily sugar. These threats are large-scale, mul ti-sectoral and pervasive in their reach 3 Between 2005 and 2007, the net food import bill ros e from Rs.15.5 billion to Rs.22.7 billion, represen ting an increase of 46%. 4 and tenacity, and they cannot be addressed in a pie cemeal manner by sectoral policies alone. An over-arching policy is necessary where is sues pertaining to land use, food security, planning, environment, energy, and the hu man development dimension may be balanced. Mauritius is reliant on imported sources for more t han 80 percent of its energy needs. Seventy to 80 percent of the island's energy requir ements are serviced by imported fossil fuel products. Mauritius has no potential for inter connection with neighbouring electricity grids, and this has encouraged the Government to lo ok into local and renewable energy sources. Privately owned co-generation coal and bag asse (the pulp residue from cane sugar extraction) power plants were set up under th e Bagasse Energy Development Programme. Hydro-electric generation supplements th e grid and research is being conducted on power generation using solar, wind and sea energy to support solar power generation for households. Initial deforestation and the later conversion to w ide scale and intensive agriculture has resulted in 43 percent of the island's surface area being used for cultivation, of which almost 89 percent is sugar cane, the balance being tea, tobacco and food crops. Abandoned cane fields make up a further additional 3 percent of land cover. Built-up areas and infrastructure account for 27 percent of land use and much of this is focused on the coast, with discharges and other land-based pol lution sources impacting on water quality of coastal wetlands and marine waters. Shor eline structures have impeded coastal sedimentation processes resulting in erosion of bea ches, which is impacting on the tourism industry. The nation has one of the highest HDIs in Africa in spite of ranking 27 th in GDP 4. The HDI, as an aggregate index, masks disparities withi n countries. It is therefore possible that a country may perform well in the aggregate HD I even if its people experience large disparities in opportunities, as in the case of Mau ritius 5. Recent reports also show an increase in income inequalities as per the Gini coe fficient (available on the CSO website). The strong linkages between justice and sustainabil ity, as well as political action that impacts positively on social equity have now been w idely accepted as prerequisites for sustainability, and the four-pillar approach by UNE SCO that includes culture, with its heritage assets is highly relevant to Mauritius. We have two World Heritage Sites, both of them under immense development pressures. In Mauritius, the year 2005 saw a change in Governm ent and a series of economic reforms ensued against the backdrop of democratizat ion of the economy. In short, the principle hinges on empowering all classes of citiz ens in achieving their full potential. It 4 In both purchasing power parity (PPP) GDP and nomi nal per capita GDP. 5 HDI is an aggregate measure of human development - life expectancy, education, individual wealth. Ma uritius is a wealthy country, with few poor people, but its HD I is low compared to countries with similar GDP. 5 also means opening up business to every citizen, pr oviding them with the necessary capacity to do so in order to promote a fairer soci ety. The Truth and Justice Commission, which aims to establish truth in terms of slaves an d indentured labourers and take appropriate measures that may be extended to their descendants, started operating in 2009. It is also considered highly significant that the Prime Minister added Equity as an axis in the quest for a Sustainable Mauritius (see section 11.3). Long gone are the days when 'top down' governance i s considered acceptable by the people of any country. In the current policy proces s, Mauritius is adopting a carefully designed 'top down, bottom up' approach to policy m aking: while the process is initiated and led by highest levels of government, policy for mulation will make ample provision for the incorporation of ground level agendas and r ealities. Carefully led and nurtured by our government, the policy formulation process will go down in history as an outstanding example of Government planning with the people. The policy initiative comes at the right time. It h as been over a decade since the comprehensive National Environmental Strategies for the Republic of Mauritius: National Environmental Action Plan for the Next Dec ade was published in 1999. In the subsequent decade our country has seen unprecedente d economic growth, bringing benefits to many people while at the same time putt ing additional strain on our resources. While there are many plans and policies that govern our development, there exists not a single document that addresses all pillars of susta inable development in the same integrated manner that the National Policy for Sust ainable Development will aim to do, and none that will have the same solid grounding in public consultation and expert opinion. 3 Mauritius in a Nutshell 3.1 A very short history of Mauritius An all-encompassing policy for sustainable developm ent can never be made without recognising the full context of the country, in ter ms of its history, geography, culture, environment and economic standing. We already menti oned that we live on a small island with few natural resources. Therefore a short journ ey along the lines of history, culture and identity may be useful at this point. Mauritius was known to Swahili, Arab, and Malay sai lors as early as the 10 th century and was originally named Dina Arobi by the Arabs. The P ortuguese sailors first visited it in 1507 but never settled and left the island uninhabi ted. Five ships of the Dutch Second Fleet were blown off course during a cyclone while on their way to the Spice Islands, 6 officially known as Zanzibar, and landed on the isl and in 1598, naming it in honour of Prince Maurice of Nassau. In 1638, the Dutch established the first settlement . They brought slaves, many of which were women. Some married their masters, while other s escaped into the woods and mountains. It is possible that maroons were the fir st permanent inhabitants of the island. Because of tough climatic conditions including cycl ones, labour shortages and the deterioration of the settlement, the Dutch abandone d the island after nearly a century in 1710. As France already controlled the neighbouring Ile Bourbon (now known as Ile de la R\u00e9union), and to prevent others from taking over , France took possession of Mauritius in 1715, and later renamed it \u00cele de France (Isle of France). Settlers and Malagasy domestics only arrived in 1722. Under French rule, the island developed a prosperous economy based on slave and commodity trading and su gar production. In the Napoleonic Wars (1803-1815) and due to corsa ir activity which harmed British commerce in the Indian Ocean, the British set out t o gain control of the island. Despite winning the Battle of Grand Port, Napoleon's only n aval victory over the British, the French surrendered to a British invasion three mont hs later. They formally surrendered on December 3, 1810, on terms allowing settlers to keep their land and property. French remained the lingua franca and law of France prevai led in criminal and civil matters. Under British rule, the island's name reverted to t he original one. Mauritius then went on to become independent in 1968. It finally became a republic in 1992. Sir Seewoosagur Ramgoolam (SSR) became the first Pr ime Minister. He left behind the legacy of a welfare state, including free education , health care, better benefits for sugar workers and a pension system. He was known as the ' Father of the Nation'. In a coalition Government with Sir Gaetan Duval, diversification o f the economy started, including light industry and the beginnings of tourism. The d ominant role of sugar cane gradually became overtaken by textile factories 6 and tourism, the thrust to establish a cyber islan d, land-based oceanic industries, medical tourism and the establishment of Mauritius as an education hub for the region - a process that is co ntinuing to this day. Over the last few years there has been a growing awareness of the nee ds for Mauritius to become a sustainable island, which again can make history at a regional level. SSR was succeeded by Sir Aneerood Jugnauth (SAJ) fr om 1982 onwards till Dr Navinchandra Ramgoolam took over in the period 1995 to 2000. SAJ came back from 2000 to 2003 and Paul Berenger assumed Prime Minist er ship from 2003 to 2005 following a political arrangement. Year 2005 saw th e return of the current incumbent, Dr Navinchandra Ramgoolam. In 2010, he was re-elected at the helm of a broadened political alliance. Clearly, since our independence a rigorous democracy has evolved that 6 In 1968 sugar cane accounted for 96% of total expo rts (and contributing 27.6% to the GDP), while in 2 003 sugar cane made up 19.6% of total exports (and contributi ng 4.4% to the GDP) of Mauritius. 7 has consistently earned us top scores in governance indices such as the Ibrahim Index for African Governance in which Mauritius occupied the top position for 2010. A Tapestry of Culture Who are the Mauritians? Compared to most other coun tries' histories, Mauritian history is very recent. It is unique because few countries had the experience of having people of so many nations and cultures regrouping in such a smal l space on an uninhabited island. Mauritius has been a cosmopolitan society from the beginning. The Indian Ocean itself has had a long rich history of cultural and economic in teractions without the absolute imposition of any one major power. Not having raw materials that colonial powers would have wished to get their hands on, Mauritius was spared of major colonial wars on its territory. It did have a good climate, luxuriant vegetation and a fertile soil and was str ategically positioned in the middle of the Indian Ocean. This led to it being transformed into a port of call, trading station, as well as an agricultural island producing sugar. Various str eams of cheap and coercible labour originated from India, Madagascar, China, mainland Africa and many other places. With them came a wide variety of customs and cultural le gacies. The Maha Shivaratree festival is among the most pop ular Hindu festivals in Mauritius. It is an occasion for great religious fervour in which 40 0,000 people participate in a pilgrimage to Grand Bassin. Other cultural highlights include Cavadee, the P\u00e8re Laval procession on 9 th September, and the Chinese Spring Festival. Amongst the hundreds of sites of cultural significance are two cultural World Heritage Sites representing two global labour systems, namely Le Morne which celebrates resistance against slavery, and Aapravasi Ghat which is an example of global significance commemorating ind entured labour. Balancing their protection in the face of development has never bee n easy 7. These multiple origins are reflected in Mauritian s ociety today, although many Mauritians may not even be aware of the rich cultural mosaic t hat they originate from. The architecture, the food, the rituals performed at ce remonies, and dress are reflective of the manner in which Mauritians today have incorporated, sometimes unconsciously, within their families and societies the traditions of others and made it their own. This 'mix' is the mortar and foundation of the Mauritian nation today, from which we build the future and teach our young how to move forward. Mauritian society, histo ry and culture are also a source of fascination and curiosity on the part of foreign vi sitors who wish to see more than just the sand and sea of Mauritius. 7 Mauritius needs to enhance its heritage and cultur al policy. An overarching policy will be needed tha t incorporates heritage as well as economic development, and shows unambiguously how the balance can be achieved. 8 3.2 Economic Miracle in the Indian Ocean - can Maur itius show the way? Like a pearl in the Indian Ocean, Mauritius can har dly be found in a world map. A sizable piece of land in some other countries in th e world may not even have caught anyone's attention. Yet this is a country in the Af rica region that is often viewed as a miracle: it is the only African country which has m anaged to provide free medical care to all its population of over 1 million. Mauritians like to think of the country as their 'l ittle paradise on earth'. It is an island where the sea is turquoise, the mountains green, an d the sun's rays feed a botanical garden of exotic plants. The country is a paradise on Earth for investors, as the island is increasingly acting as a trading platform for Madag ascar and mainland Africa, and increasingly Asia. Joseph E. Stiglitz, Nobel Laurea te in Economics, in The Mauritius Miracle points out that the economic status of Maur itius makes one think that the country must be rich in diamonds, oil, or other valuable co mmodity. Nothing can be further from the truth: Mauritius has few exploitable land-based natural resources. Stiglitz notes that the country's prospects were so dismal that when it approached independence from Britain, which came in 1968, that another Nobel pri ze-winning economist James Meade wrote in 1961: \" It is going to be a great achievem ent if [the country] can find productive employment for its population without a serious red uction in the existing standard of living....The outlook for peaceful development is wea k.\" Stiglitz points out that Mauritius has proved that Meade is wrong, having in creased their per capita income from less than $400 around the time of independence to more than $6,700 today. He points out that the country has progressed from the sugar-based monoculture of 50 years ago to a diversified economy that includes tourism, finance, textiles, and, if current plans bear fruit, advanced technology. Lately, Mauritius also sees itself as playing a far bigger role as a regional port that w ill connect Asian, African, Middle-eastern and European markets. Stiglitz states that firstly Mauritians have chosen a path that leads to higher levels of social cohesion, welfare and economic growth - and to a lower level of inequality. Secondly, unlike many other small countries, Maurit ius has decided that most military spending is a waste. Thirdly, Mauritius recognised that with a few natural resources, its people were its main asset. Maybe that appreciation for its human resources is also what led Mauritius to realise that, particularly given t he country's potential religious, ethnic, and political differences, education for all was cr ucial to social unity. Fortunately, Mauritius has undergone a paradigm shift in how it views it cultural resources and \"The Mauritius Miracle dates to independence. But the country still struggles with some of its colonial legacies: inequality in land and wealth, as well as vulnerability to high-stakes global politics.\" Joseph E. Stiglitz, 2011 Nobel Laureate in Economics 9 remaining relative pristine coastal areas and natur al place, all of which are becoming increasingly rare, and hence more valuable. Jeffrey Frankel, in Mauritius: African Success Story similarly sings the praises of Mauritius as an economic success story, again point ing to lessons that can be learned by other countries. Not everyone is equally optimistic . Martin Minogue cautions in his review article Mauritius: Economic Miracle or Developmental Illusi on against blanket euphoria and points out some of the weaknesses in t he economy. Stiglitz does mention some of Mauritius' economic problems, but nonethele ss maintains that many countries, even the United States, can learn from Mauritius. W hatever the case may be, the medium-term, our chances to remain the Miracle of t he Indian Ocean will be closely linked to the extent by which we can achieve the vi sion of a Sustainable Mauritius. 3.3 Taking the leap The pursuit of sustainability can never be easy. To take the necessary steps will require insight and understanding of the need to do so at a societal level, which comes with education, a high level of awareness, which of course is greatly boosted by a free and effective press and other media, and the involvement of all in public debate. A strong education system leads to a more educated nation. Firmly placing the country on a sustainable traject ory will also require financial means. Some sacrifices and financial commitments will need to be made. Even running the policy process in itself requires funding, and impl ementing strategies and action plans will require a whole lot more capital. Good governa nce and 'political will' are essential prerequisites also, in order to keep vested interes ts at bay while ensuring that the majority of people are genuinely accommodated. All of the above describes Mauritius fairly well. T he country is ready to formulate the landmark policy that will consolidate its economic, environmental, social and cultural assets, and place the nation, our seas and land on a sustainable trajectory. It is ready to take the leap. \"The MID project belongs to the Mauritian nation... It belongs to each and every one of us\" Prime Minister, Dr. The Honourable Navinchandra RAMGOOLAM, GCSK, FRCP December 1, 2010 10 4 The policy formulation process 4.1 The essence of policy formulation Dialogue between Government and civil society forms an integral part of policy formulation. This means that all sectors of civil s ociety have a chance to say, in as much detail as they need to, what they consider as impor tant in terms of the content of the proposed National Policy for a Sustainable Mauritius. Ministries provide structured input, which has to be compared with input from the people. The policy formulation process is based on the dynamic interface that lies between the needs and aspirations of the people and the existin g mandates of government. If serious gaps exist along this interface between Government and the people, then they can be addressed in the policy. The dialogue and above analysis is simply essential . While in some countries there may be wide disparity between what the people need, and the agenda of government, this is hardly expected in Mauritius where there is a stron g tradition of democracy and a comprehensive set of policies, strategies and laws. Here the quest for sustainability may be a matter of filling gaps by making amendments to the legal machinery, adjusting or putting in place new institutional arrangements, an d possibly creating new positions or coordinating bodies. The obstacles that the Ministries encounter in the common pursuit of sustainable development must be carefully considered. Hence a r eview of the existing mandates of Ministries, the legal instruments at their avail, a nd the overall institutional landscape is necessary, so that shortcomings can be identified a nd addressed accordingly. Specialist studies may be required, particularly in formulatin g a policy as wide-ranging as the current one 8. If necessary, working groups may also be establis hed. 4.2 Green Paper, White Paper, Acts and Regulations In a democratic society, a country's citizens have ample opportunity to provide input into policy formulation. Therefore, a rigorous policy pr ocess was designed and endorsed by Cabinet in December 2009. The Green Paper summarises Phase 1 of the policy process. It presents initial input from the Mauritian people , and a basic gap analysis of governance 8 Therefore provision for the involvement of such ex perts was made already at the national consultation stage; however, they will now be brought into the next pha se of the process. Good policy is the result of an informed and protracted dialogue between Government and civil society. 11 in relation to sustainable development. Based on th e results, it makes recommendations for the way ahead. The Green Paper provides feedback for the sake of t ransparency, and solicits further discussion by all stakeholders. It sets the scene f or Phase 2, which is now ready to start and has as its main outcome a policy document known as the White Paper . Phase 2 will include specialist studies, further consultation an d workshops, and finally the formulation of strategies and action plans. Specialist studies will keep policy directions realistic, while institutional and legal review will ensure th at effective mechanisms are put in place for policy implementation. The Draft White Paper will again be subjected to pu blic comment before it is finally submitted to Cabinet to be promulgated as Policy . Once endorsed by Cabinet, it officially becomes the National Policy for a Sustainable Mauritius . Policy presents the position of Government, and forms the basis for legislation. It is likely that the National Policy for a Sustainable Mauritius will guide the drafting of a Bill (i.e. a draft Act of Parliament) for enactment by Parliament. Once the Act is in place, regulations can be derived from it. 4.3 Defining, agreeing and testing the policy proce ss The Government led policy process is implemented in collaboration with civil society. To ensure transparency and credibility, a large range of parties were invited to participate in the design of the process. It had to be clear how i nput is solicited, analysed, and used in policy formulation. Once activated, the agreed meth odology and sequence of events must be strictly adhered to. Ad hoc deviations may serio usly erode the credibility of the process, unless the reasons are practical and accep table to all. Credibility is a prerequisite for obtaining the collaborative and long-term suppo rt that is necessary for implementation. The process was discussed and refined in a series o f preparatory meetings. The MREPU (the then lead ministry) 9, other Ministries, the MID Organising Committee, t he Steering Committee at the PMO, Lord Mayors and councillors, umbrella NGOs, UNDP, the University of Mauritius (UoM), the University of Te chnology (UTM), other entities in the academic establishment, representatives from a large range of other organisations [including the Joint Economic Council (JEC), and th e Mauritius Research Council], the private sector (such as Women in Networking) and th e donor agencies (in particular AFD and UNDP) participated in discussions on the design of the process. What emerged was a highly participative process wit h re-iterative feedback mechanisms, and several bodies to oversee implementation and pr otect its integrity. At this point the collectively designed methodology had to be tested. Trial runs were held with Ministries 9 Then known as the Ministry of Renewable Energy and Public Utilities (MREPU). 12 and umbrella NGOs, and ground level organisations s uch as fishermen associations. The methodology was also tested with the local communit y of Le Morne, and at a National Youth Summit under the aegis of the Rajiv Gandhi Sc ience Centre (RGSC). The process design proved to be robust in all cases. The steps of the policy process was published in th e press, discussed on the radio, and officialised when the Deputy Prime Minister, Dr. Th e Honourable R. Beebeejaun, launched the national consultations on 19 February 2010. 4.4 The backbone of the process The backbone of the process is a simple linear sequ ence of events depicted by thick black arrows (see Figure 1 below, for a simplified versio n): 1. The process starts with the raising of awareness, b oth in terms of sustainability issues and the policy process itself ( the blue box ). 2. Input then comes from diverse sources, notably civi l society, Special Interest Groups, various levels of Government and so on. Inp ut sources on the left side of Figure 1, namely from civil society, and right side , from the Government machinery, are discussed below. Diverse issues woul d be noted and discussed, and draft visions of a Sustainable Mauritius will t hen be formulated as 'end goals' to which the country will aspire. 3. A Draft National Vision ( the red box ) is developed. 4. Input is preliminarily analyzed and summarised in t he Green Paper ( the green box ), which by its very nature and purpose, should be simply written and easily digestible by all parties who provided input thus f ar. They need to feel confident that the Green Paper captured their input sufficien tly well, before the process continues. 5. The Green Paper not only embodies the needs and asp irations of Mauritians but is also intended to stimulate debate. Its publication and validation is a benchmark in the process. It points out main focal areas that wi ll become pillars of the policy. Targeted Studies ( the yellow box ) now feed into the process. 6. Once all stakeholder input and targeted studies hav e been taken into account the White Paper ( the white box ), which effectively is the Draft Policy, is prepar ed and submitted to Cabinet. Once endorsed, it becomes the National Policy for a Sustainable Mauritius ( the blue box ). 13 Awareness Draft National Vision Green Paper White Paper National Policy for a Sustainable Mauritius Targeted Studies Stakeholder consultations Stakeholder consultations Stakeholder consultations = Draft Policy 5SIG 4 SIG 3SIG 2SIG 1Ministry Ministry Ministry Ministry Ministry Ministry Ministry Ministries Input Civil Society Input Draft White Paper Local and Regional Administration Figure 1: Flowchart of the Policy Process The aim of the policy process is to reconcile perva sive public opinion, as well as the input of all specific interest groups with speciali st studies and existing knowledge. In this manner it will aim to provide a clear set of guidin g principles and mechanisms that can be translated into do-able actions. 4.5 Soliciting Input There are many ways to solicit input, and they all have their advantages and disadvantages. Public meetings, while creating the impressions that they are 'open' to all and everyone, have the shortcoming that they are of ten dominated by one or two, or at most a handful of people, while the vast majority m ay be reluctant to speak out. After much consideration, it was decided that the aim of fulfilling the promise that 'every Mauritian who wished to give input would have the o pportunity to do so' could only be accomplished through a combination of input mechani sms. Special Interest Group Meetings Special Interest Groups (SIGs) consist of people wh o share a common interest, for instance through their careers, gender interests, o r other common circumstances. The 14 members of such groups tend to speak out more easil y in group meetings as they feel they are not just 'one of a crowd'. The disadvantage may be that they are biased towards a particular sector. This disadvantage can be overcom e by stressing to participants right at the start that they are not invited to speak about their own interests only, but as Mauritians, and the output showed that this worked rather well. Another disadvantage may be that 'Special Interest Groups' are pre-deter mined by the organisers of the consultations, i.e. they decide who constitutes, or belongs to interests groups and who does not. This shortcoming was overcome by extendin g the invitation to any group of people who considered themselves a Special Interest Group to participate in a consultative meeting. Also, it was made clear that anyone who wished to do so could attend any special interest group meeting. Ministries' Input Intensive input from all Ministries was not possibl e at the Green Paper stage, and is best left to when institutional and legal experts are in place. Ministries implement laws, to facilitate sector developments, monitor compliance, and ensure that good governance is practised. In addition to organising meetings with departments of a few Ministries and the PMO Steering Committee where all Ministries were re presented, input from all Ministries were solicited through carefully designe d questionnaires. Since the Ministries will be the key implementers of the policy, their v iews on sustainability, their missions and their mandates, and how they relate to Maurice Ile Durable are critically important. So is an examination of the legal frameworks and in struments, gaps, obstacles encountered by them, and with other Ministries, etc ., and their recommendations for implementation. Public meetings and other means of input It was decided that no stone would be left unturned in getting the necessary input from the nation as speedily and effectively as possible, including from Rodrigues and the Outer Islands. Please refer to section 5 below for more d etail. 4.6 The National Vision At the heart of the policy process is the creation of the Draft National Vision ( the red box , Figure 1). Once adopted by Government, the Draft Na tional Vision becomes the official National Vision. The National Vision describes an end point to which we all aspire, and provides a beacon along the way. It is an expression of where we want to see our country heading, how we want to live in that country and to a large extent, the kind of people we want to be as a nation. The National Vision hence was created throu gh a dialogue between Government and civil society (namely the policy process). It i s only through a thorough consultation process that a credible Vision and its ownership by all Mauritians can be obtained. 15 4.7 Targeted studies Targeted studies include thematic working groups , specialist studies , and legal and institutional review . Policy making has as its foundation an assessment of the needs and aspirations of the people i.e. taking stock of what we have both at a popular level, as well as at the institutional and scientific level. The d ialogue between Government and civil society continues throughout policy formulation. It is important to note that the targeted studies are intended to enrich the policy formulati on process, but cannot be the main driver. If working groups, for instance, are asked to 'think up' the policy, then the prerogative of the people to plan together with Gov ernment is instantly undermined and participative democracy will fail. Initially, the commissioning of Targeted Studies wo uld have started before the Green Paper was published, and continued. The Green Paper will then have included a situational analysis that could guide public debate further. However, there are distinct advantages to first establish the positions held by the Mauritian peop le. Their input could then be used as materials for the working groups, w ho would then be tasked to respond to what were flagged as potential pillars of the polic y. What is however very important is to disseminate the results of targeted studies widely so that input into a Draft White Paper (the grey box ) during inclusive workshop(s), may be thoroughly c onsidered. Working Groups Working groups will be driven by the findings of th e Green Paper. They will make use of expertise that already exists in Mauritius. However , it is very important that the working groups be balanced in terms of their composition an d expertise 10 . Their themes and design cannot be pre-emptive, as this would reflect the views and priorities of whoever appointed them rather than broad-based input, and t his may warp the process. Instead, the working group themes should reflect the results of the commonly agreed and tested consultative process. Specialist Studies If necessary, further in-depth specialist studies c an be commissioned to improve the results of working groups or to address particular issues raised, either in the consultative meetings or the working groups. Specialist studies may also be commissioned when specific strategies, and/or an action plan is devel oped for policy implementation. Policy and Legal Review It was well recognised and agreed upon during the d esign stage that policy formulation will be carried out by a thorough legal review of e xisting laws and policies as well as an 10 The consultative meetings made a point that experts do not only exist amongst scientists, but also amo ngst practitioners in the different sectors. For example , it is not only fisheries scientists or ministry o fficials that have knowledge of fish, but the fishermen themselves (se e Section 6.6.1 below). 16 in-depth institutional analysis. The country alread y has a comprehensive existing legal and policy landscape, and the vast majority of poli cies and laws have a strong bearing on sustainability (or the lack thereof). Therefore, a new policy has to be fully in line with existing laws and policies in as far as they may ha ve an impact on the pursuit of a Sustainable Mauritius. Such studies are expected to reveal gaps, overlaps and even contradictions within, and between existing policies. They will not only impro ve the contents of the new policy, in terms of what may be lacking in the existing legal frameworks, but also on how the new policy may relate to existing policies and/or how t hey may relate to one another, what the obstacles may be that impede their effective implem entation, or what mechanism may need to be put in place that could, for instance, i mprove coordination between laws, policies and legal instruments that will strengthen Mauritius' pursuit of sustainability. In fact, not considering existing policies may lead to damning oversights that can paralyze and turn the current policy process into a superfluous exercise. A rare and one time opportunity to take stock of what Mauritius ha s in place, and to improve and build on an already elaborate foundation, may be lost for ever. The purpose of dialogue between Government and civil society, which is a premise of the current policy formulation process, would be lost. The dialogue requires that civil society and Government discuss on what needs to be done, which tools are already a vailable to achieve the targets, and what is missing in the overall Government machinery in order to achieve a sustainable trajectory. 4.8 The Policy process is launched Cabinet agreed in December 2009 to initiate a polic y process to develop a National Policy for a Sustainable Mauritius. The process wou ld crystallize the MID concept, develop a shared National Vision, and provide an ov erall framework for the pursuit of a Sustainable Mauritius. The outcome would be the pol icy itself, together with strategies and implementation plans. From the outset, it was agreed that the policy form ulation process would be a highly participative one. After all, the entire nation is affected. Furthermore, people are more likely to participate in a process that they unders tand and agree with. With the ownership that comes through participation, they are more lik ely to make necessary sacrifices, change habits and be patient when results are not i mmediate. 17 The then Ministry of Renewable Energy and Public Ut ilities (MREPU) was designated as the lead ministry for the process. In addition to t he Technical Support Unit, the General Facilitator advised the MREPU on the setting up of an Organising Committee at their level to monitor and implement the policy process. Thus the national consultations were launched on 19 February 2010 by the Deputy Prime Minister Dr. The Honourable R. Beebeejaun, with the objective of inviting every Mauritian citizen to participate in the formulation of the National Policy for a Sustainable Mauritius. Finally in September 2009, a Steering Committee was set up at the level of the Prime Minister's Office (PMO) to coordinate the \" Maurice Ile Durable \" (MID) project from a more holistic perspective. Plate 1: Launching Ceremony by the Hon Deputy Prime Minister, Minister of Energy and Public Utilities 18 5 The Running of the Policy Process 5.1 Managing the process The then Ministry of Renewable Energy and Public Ut ilities (MREPU) planned and implemented the policy process. An Organising Commi ttee (OC) was set up by the MREPU to organise the national consultations, monit or implementation of work, and address ad hoc issues that may arise. Practical matters were dele gated to the Technical Support Unit (TSU) attached to the MREPU. The MID S teering Committee under the PMO coordinated input from the Ministries. Annex 1 describes in detail how the process was managed and run. 5.2 Special Interest Group (SIG) meetings Special Interest Groups consist of stakeholders who share common concerns. Consultative meetings were organised with the follo wing Special Interest Groups (SIGs): Plate 2: Some Special Interest Groups meeting held in February and March 2010 19 1) Academia and students 2) Agro Industry 3) Construction Industry 4) Culture 5) Education 6) Environment 7) Fisheries 8) Health 9) Industry/Export Associations 10) Information & Communication Technology 11) Land Transport and Shipping 12) Local Authorities 13) NGOs 14) Private Sector/Economic Operators 15) Social Security 16) Tourism 17) Trade Unions 18) Water 19) Women 20) Youth & Sports By April 2010, fifty meetings had been held with SI Gs. In Mauritius, meetings were held with SIGs and officers of the District and Mun icipal Councils. In Rodrigues meetings were held with the members of the Rodrigue s Environment Committee, Thematic Groups, the Deputy Chief Commissioner, the Commissioners, the representatives of Social Groups, and presidents of Village Councils. In addition, Representatives of the Outer Islands Development Co rporation also met and consulted residents of Agalega Island in March 2010. See Anne x 2 for the list of all meetings held. Outcomes of each meeting were usually a set of conc erns, opportunities, views, a draft Vision and other inputs. A sample list of iss ues arising from a typical SIG meeting is included in Annex 3. The various vision statements developed are compiled in Annex 4 . 5.3 Inputs from Ministries/Parastatal Bodies Ministries submitted their views (see Annex 5 and 9 ) on the following: Sustainability issues, The vision and missions of their respective ministr y, Plate 4: Village presidents and General Facilitator in Rodrigues 27 March 2010 Plate 3: SIG meeting in Rodrigues, Environment Committee 26 March 2010 20 Their mandates in relation to sustainable developme nt, Issues, gaps and obstacles in their pursuit of sust ainable outcomes, Legal and other instruments they had to their avail , Issues that ought to be addressed but are not curre ntly taken care of, Overlaps with other Ministries and; Recommendations on what are required to achieve sus tainable development The MID Steering Committee under the PMO coordinate d ministerial input via guiding questionnaires.

Seventy colleges participated in the Summ it, in which two representatives of each school presented their visi on of the sustainable development of Mauritius. On the second day a proposed National Vision was formulated. 21 Plate 5: Launching of National Youth Summit Ceremon y, (Wednesday, 31 March 2010) 5.5 Questionnaires, e-mails and letters Two types of questionnaires (see Annex 5 & 6) were designed to solicit inputs from individuals and NGOs, regarding their views on sust ainability. These questionnaires were distributed during meetings, and could also be downloaded from the MIDF website (http://midf.gov.mu ). 5.6 Other inputs received Inputs were been received through various channels such as Special Interest Group meetings, questionnaires, emails, letters etc. Tabl e 1 below shows the types and number of inputs received. Table 1: Frequency of inputs received per category Types of Inputs No. received SIG meetings (list of issues) 50 Individual Inputs (free format) Emails 110 Letters 17 Reports and Publications 15 Feedback forms / questionnaires Standard (individual) 182 NGOs 7 Inputs from Ministries & Parastatal Bodies Ministries 19 Parastatal Bodies 6 TOTAL 402 22 5.7 Status by June 2010 The first phase of the consultations launched on 19 February 2010, ended in the beginning of April 2010. As elections were announce d for May 2010, it was decided to withhold further consultations process until the elections were over. Following the formation of the new Government, the Maurice Ile Du rable Fund (MIDF) has been in the process of being transferred to the Ministry of Environment and Sustainable Development for some time. The new lead Ministry wi ll now be re-launching the process in 2011. 23 6 Where Mauritians want to move 6.1 The people have spoken Consultative meetings allowed people to speak openl y about what was important to them, and they responded with tremendous enthusiasm . A huge amount of input was gained. This input can be analysed to various depth s in order to address particular concerns. The Green Paper has the primary role of i nforming subsequent stages in the process and, the results are presented only in broa d strokes 11 . Further information, both on the results and the methodology, is provide d in Annex 7 and 8. 6.2 Initial analysis The Technical Support Unit (TSU) and General Facili tator processed 362 documents (see TSU report 2010), out of which 46 were from SI G meetings, 182 from standard questionnaires and 7 from NGO questionnaires, 110 e mails and 17 letters. Issues raised were grouped into 4 categories, i.e. Economy , Environment, Social and Stewardship of Government. Inputs were categorised into 36 themes, 81 sub-themes and 117 issues. Scores per sector, theme and issue, were calculated from the number of times an issue was raised, and a total score of 9,765 was obtained (See Annex 7). 6.3 Overall trends As a preliminary observation, the proportions of th e scores attributed to the four categories mentioned above, are presented in Table 2. Table 2: Percentage of views expressed by the popul ation by category (sustainable development parameters and Government actions and sensitisation) Sectors Score Percentage Environment 2978 inter alia , will assist in the setting-up of thematic worksho ps in Phase 2. Consultative meetings as such did not allow sufficient discussion, as their main purpose was to provide the opportunity for par ticipants to flag issues; therefore, although there was consensu s on major issues, everyone may not have agreed on every point. Thematic workshops will allow for further di scussion, in-depth analysis and hopefully consensus on future directions. 24 The participants expressed environmental and econom ic issues as their main concerns, with social issues not far behind. Intere stingly, the need for Government to commit to sustainable development and taking approp riate actions, including the provision of financial incentives, the development and enforcement of respective legislations, was considered important in 18% of th e views of the population. 6.4 Economic, Environmental and Social Dimensions Table 3 lists themes under the three normally accep ted dimensions for sustainable development. Table 3: List of Themes under Economy /Environment/ Social Sectors ECONOMY ENVIRONMENT SOCIAL Foreign Direct Investment New Model of Economic Development Tourism Industry Transport Energy Agriculture Fisheries Corporate Social Responsibility Construction Public Infrastructure Technology Preservation of natural resources Pollution Waste Water Land Social Cohesion Leisure Elderly Youth Women Disabled Education Poverty Health Security Food Security Culture Family Employees / Workers Democracy Law and Order NGOs For each of these themes, there are subthemes that were used for the analysis as shown in the TSU report (2010). 25 6.4.1 The Economic Dimension The most cited issues related to the economic secto r are shown below: Figure 2: Frequency by which economically related i ssues were raised. The most frequently cited issues by the general pub lic, Special Interest Groups and NGOs, were related to energy (35%) and transport (16%) . Issues emphasize the necessity to save energy, promote energy efficiency and renewable energy, and to encourage eco-friendly transport while reducing tra ffic congestion. Energy and transport together represented 51%, thus reflecting a major concern to reduce the nations' consumption of fossil fuels. 26 The third most cited issue was the necessity to ado pt a new Model of Economic Development (10%) , which must be sustainable. A different approach i s desirable concerning economic growth as indicated by issues r aised. Issues raised imply that the nation should consume differently, therefore econom ic development should promote local production and stop the purchase of imported products whenever similar ones are available locally. Strong interest was shown in green construction (9%), and the necessity to promote sustainable land use planning and green buildings w as highlighted. This was often discussed in some detail. Buildings have to be well designed and planned to consider all the important aspects of sustainable developmen t, such as energy efficiency, practicality, functionality, quality of life, etc. Open spaces were considered to have great value, and should be protected as far as poss ible. Pristine areas and coastal areas that have not been developed yet should also be protected. Such natural attributes were considered to not only have aesthet ic value, but also economic value that increases as they become scarcer. 6.4.2 The Environment Dimension The relative importance of issues category wise rel ated to the environment sector is shown in Figure 3. Figure 3: Breakdown of Environmental Issues 27 The most cited issues were: The necessity to preserve and protect natural resources (37%) and to ensure a clean environment where biodiversity is respected. Emphasis was placed on the importance of protecting our marine resources and b eaches, preserving flora, preserving open and green spaces by planting trees, and making use of natural resources in a judicious and sustainable manner. The necessity to reduce all types of pollution (27%), such as air, water, land, noise and even visual pollution were often linked t o the importance of a greener industry, a more sustainable agriculture, a reduced use of fossil fuels, etc. The necessity to develop and implement a user-frien dly system for waste management (25%). The systems should begin with reducing waste, sorti ng waste at its source into separate bins, the re-use and/or recycling of waste and composting of organic waste. People often emphasise d the importance of educating people on how to sort their waste. 6.4.3 The Social Dimension The key issues relating to the social sector are in dicated in Figure 4 below. Figure 4: Breakdown of Social Issues 28 Education (16%) appears to be a major concern. Concerns focus most ly on the necessity to improve the education system, especial ly for primary schools, and to include elements of sustainable development in the curriculum. Research must be promoted through increased funding and refining res earch directions to reflect the pursuit of a Sustainable Mauritius. Employees and workers' rights and welfare (13%) were also cited as important elements of sustainable development, especially the importance of lifelong learning, and the issue of unemployment which could be tackle d through the creation of new jobs that either relate to, or are in line with sus tainable development. A wide concern for Health (12%) was emphasised, as well as the need to improve the health system, improve the hygiene and the general health of the population, and boost the fight against problems such as HIV/AIDS, drugs, alcohol etc. Of equal importance is the necessity to promote Social Cohesion (12%) , that is, intercultural respect and peace, social justice and solidarity among Mauritians. 6.5 Good governance as a fourth pillar of sustainab le development It is considered highly significant that governance issues made up a fourth category in the Mauritian context; without good governance the pursuit of sustainability in a modern nation will be in vain. There is a significant degree of consensus that good governance relates to political and institutional processes, and is deemed necessary to achieve the goals of sustainable development. It has been said that good governance is the process whereby public institutions conduct public affairs, manage public resources and guarantee the realization of human rights in a mann er essentially free of abuse and corruption, and with due regard to the rule of law. The true test of \"good\" governance is the degree to which it delivers on the promise o f human rights: civil, cultural, economic, political and social rights. The key question is: whether the institutions are e ffectively guaranteeing the right to health, adequate housing, sufficient food, quality education, fair justice and personal security? Again, Mauritius may be making history he re. Depending on how the National Policy for a Sustainable Mauritius is formulated, and the degree by which good governance will be accepted as a pillar of sustainable development in it, the country may become a living example of how good governance can play a key role in the pursuit of sustainable development. 29 6.6 Overall priorities The relative importance 12 of the themes mentioned, irrespective of which dim ension of sustainable development they belong to is shown in Figure 5. Figure 5: Percentage breakdown of overall main them es 12 It is important to note that all themes are consid ered equally important at this stage. Some very imp ortant issues may have been mentioned only once in a meeti ng, because everyone agreed, resulting in a smaller score. Other issues may have been mentioned in various way s to get the point across, possibly resulting in a higher score. 30 The eighteen themes in Figure 5 are briefly discuss ed below: Theme 1: Government's commitment, legislations, and actions (16%) One major issue that surfaced in all meetings was t he imperative for Government to take action to promote sustainable development in t he country, for instance by developing and reinforcing the necessary legislatio ns. Another issue was that Government actions ought to have a holistic, and coherent approach in promoting sustainable development. Care ful, integrated planning and increased efficiency in terms of human, natural, or material resources were deemed essential. The following significant questions were asked: Why, in spite of all our laws, environmental degrad ation was still taking place? Why we were still losing valuable public spaces for the benefit of few? Is the legislation not sufficient? Is the legislation not enacted? Or is there simply not enough coordination among th ose bodies responsible for implementing the law? Theme 2: Preservation of natural resources (9%) Mauritians love their 'little paradise', and they w ant to keep it physically attractive for as long as possible. It was also pointed out that t ourists are lured to Mauritius by its sheer beauty. There were strong calls for preservin g our natural resources (marine resources, landscapes, flora, fauna, and beaches). Concerns were raised regarding the disappearance of coastal areas in particular, inclu ding access to beaches for the general population (as opposed to creating more exc usive beaches). Land is well recognised as a valuable natural resource, along wi th the scenic beauty of the country. Theme 3: Waste management (8%) The lack of effective waste management frequently c ame up as a burning issue. People complained that there was no proper waste ma nagement system in the country. Waste was recognised as being a problem at the indu strial as well as domestic level. 31 Theme 4: Sensitisation and building of awareness (8 %) Every Mauritian is an actor to the sustainable deve lopment of Mauritius. This is why everyone should be fully sensitised on what sustain ability means, why it is essential and urgent to adopt a sustainable way of living, an d what should be done to promote sustainability. Sustainable development is not only about how companies and Government operate, but about everyone readjusting his/her lifestyle. This is not a temporary but permanent effort and it should not be seen as an 'effort' but rather viewed as evidence of a sustainable lifestyle. Ther efore an ongoing programme of overall sensitisation and awareness building target ing specific issues should be embedded in the MID Policy, Strategy and Action Pla n. Theme 5: Reduction of pollution (7%) All parties have to work toward reducing and preven ting all types of pollution (air, water, land, noise, etc). Sources of pollution were discussed, including pollution from energy production, land-based pollution from agricu ltural run-off and effluent from hotels that may have an impact on lagoons. Theme 6: Energy (7%) Energy is considered a pertinent issue as far as th e sustainable development of Mauritius is concerned. It is important to promote energy efficiency, avoid wastage, and save/conserve energy. The nation needs to reduc e its dependence on fossil fuels as fast as possible, and promote renewable energy. Suggestions were put forth on the use of renewable energy sources and improving exist ing, as well as developing new technologies to harness energy from the sun, wind, wave action, and so forth. Theme 7: Education, research, use of updated techno logy (6%) It was suggested that the current education curricu lum be reviewed and elements of sustainable development be integrated so that child ren may be more aware of the importance of sustainability and self-sustaining ac tions and habits. Children and youth need to change their behaviours accordingly from an early age. In addition, research and the use of updated technology that promotes the conservation of the environment, and improves the quality of life, as well as the ec onomy must be considered. Theme 8: Employees' welfare, culture, family values , and leisure (6%) Other issues raised included giving work opportunit ies, training, lifelong learning to people, etc. The need for proper working conditions to be ensured for all employees, 32 no matter what their ranks, was also highlighted. P eople expressed the need to be able to practice and protect their culture yet have the freedom and means to promote cultural identities and heritage. There is a growin g awareness of the rich and varied cultural assets in Mauritius, and protecting and us ing them wisely should be part and parcel of sustainable development. Mutual respect f or different cultures that make up the composite culture of Mauritius should be encour aged. People need to be able to engage in leisure activities, have time to spend wi th their families, and have adequate facilities for sports, recreation along the beaches and so forth. Theme 9: Transport (5%) Transport issues were flagged in virtually every me eting, not only in terms of air pollution and fuel prices, but also in terms of qua lity of life (in particular traffic congestion and transport systems that may not be as efficient as they could be). Government was urged to find solutions to traffic c ongestion as a matter of urgency, as it affects the health and quality of life of peo ple. Examination of the raw data may contribute further to working group discussions. Theme 10: Sustainable construction, planning (5%) In a Small Island Developing State, land is obvious ly precious and land use planning must aim to optimise the value and uses of land. Th e statement was made that Mauritius must aim to use each and every metre of i ts land to its best advantage. One should not be allowed 'to build anywhere'; instead elements such as biodiversity, landscape, heritage etc. should be considered. Appr opriate legislation / guidelines should be developed in order to promote such kind o f construction. Theme 11: Agriculture, fisheries and food security (4%) The work of planters, breeders, and fishers must be recognised and respected, and they should be empowered to make a better living. A t the same time, their activities should be environment friendly. For example, in the case of agriculture the use of polluting chemical fertilisers should be phased out , while organic farming and the use of compost should be encouraged. Fishing has to be controlled so as to protect the marine biodiversity and to achieve Maximum Sustaina ble Yield (MSY) as well as to allow species to reproduce and survive. Marine reso urces must be protected from polluting hotel activities such as water sports whi ch should be reduced and properly controlled. Sustainable agriculture and fisheries can improve f ood security and the quality of food that Mauritians eat. It is important to protect and enable these sectors so that 33 Mauritius becomes self-sufficient as far as food is concerned. The nation should not rely too much on imported foods and should be able to produce good quality food locally in sufficient quantities. Concerns were rai sed on how land is used in terms of food production, and it was often pointed out that sugar production should not be the sole agricultural practice. Vegetable gardening may also be encouraged to combat food shortage and even food security at the househo ld level. Theme 12: Poverty, social cohesion, gender, the eld erly and disabled (4%) It has been said that the true success of a country can be judged by how it accommodates its vulnerable groups. Every Mauritian should have proper housing and have their basic needs satisfied. There is no s ustainability in a country where human rights are not respected and where there is d iscrimination against women and vulnerable groups such as elderly and disabled. Pov erty has to be reduced to the minimum. Everyone's human dignity should be respect ed and every Mauritian should be given equal opportunities without any discrimina tion. The women's associations and Women in Networking (WIN) made many contributio ns here. These can be treated in thematic workshops in the next phase. Si gnificantly, however, most other meetings also highlighted issues under this theme. The question arose more than once: why do vulnerable sections of the society still suf fer when the country is considered to be such an economic miracle? Theme 13: Participative democracy, good governance, the role of NGOs (4%) Mauritians expressed pride in their democratic trad itions that have evolved since Independence. Every Mauritian should be able to par ticipate in politics, should enjoy freedom of speech and open access to information. S uch traditions should continuously be strengthened. Government is made up of various representatives wh o are accountable to the people. Yet democracy should not be restricted to elections only, but must be participative on an ongoing basis so that people have a say in decis ions that affect them. There were calls for a higher degree of participative democrac y, or 'dialogue' democracy that can operate alongside representative, or delegative dem ocracy. The role of NGOs should be recognised and facilitat ed so they have a fair degree of independence in terms of funding and voicing their opinions. It was noted that a democratic country respects principles of good gove rnance, which includes strengthening of civil society, and instating stron g sanctions against corruption. For Mauritians, these issues were paramount in the purs uit of a Sustainable Mauritius. 34 Theme 14: Green industries and a new Model of Econo mic Development (3%) For Mauritius to be sustainable, Mauritians need to adopt a sustainable mode of production and consumption. Green industry, that is , industries that are less polluting and produce eco-friendly products have to be promot ed. A new Model of Economic Development which considers long term environmental and social stakes as opposed to short-term gains ha s to be promoted. The nation should change their mindset, over-consumptive habit s and stop seeking temporary benefits at the cost of a sustainable future. They should understand that long term benefits are more desirable than short-term gains a nd they readjust their consumption habits accordingly. They should, for example, promo te local production and prefer local products to imported ones of a similar kind, even if they may not be as cheap in the short term. Theme 15: Health (3%) \"What is development, what is wealth for, if we do not have health? \" The people in Mauritius recognise that they cannot succeed if the population is \"sick\" and there are no adequate health facilities and services offered without discrimination. Consequently, it is essential to improve the health system in Mauritius and the quality of hospital services, in terms of service, hygiene, and technology. The health of Mauritians is fundamental to the well being of the country. Government should fight problems such as drugs, HIV/AIDS, pand emics, tobacco, and alcohol through proper prevention and treatment. There were calls for Health Impact Assessments (HIA) to be conducted before certain pr ojects are approved. Theme 16: Security, law and order (2%) Mauritians do not want to live in fear of their liv es and want a safe environment where their children can grow up without fear. Crime has to be fought in Mauritius through adequate education, prevention, and a system of reh abilitation of prisoners. Prisoners should be given a good treatment, in accordance wit h the human rights principles. Adequate facilities and updated technology should b e provided to the police force in order to optimise their chances in their search for criminals. Law and order has to be respected and enforced. The Rule of Law must be res pected at all times. 35 Theme 17: Tourism (1%) Tourism is recognised as an important economic sect or that has strong interactions with other sectors. However, concerns were raised r egarding coastal areas becoming exclusive, and that democratisation of the economy should include making it possible for smaller players to enter the industry. Tourism needs to be diversified into cultural, heritage and ecotourism. The country has much more to offer than beach tourism only. Tourism should not be developed at the cost of othe r sectors, and a careful balance should be achieved between the costs and benefits o f tourism. Tourism should be sustainable and guidelines for responsible tourism that considers the environment as well as social impacts should be developed. Theme 18: Water (1%) As a small highly populated island, water reserves are a serious limitation in Mauritius. Consequently, we should ensure an efficient system of rainwater collection and a good maintenance of water reserves. As currently practis ed in Rodrigues, collection of rain water should be encouraged in Mauritius at the indi vidual level also. Water is a vital element and its importance should not be underestim ated. Mauritians should have access to sufficient and high quality potable water . It is not only water sources that should be protected, but Water Demand Management (W DM) should be put in place everywhere in the country. 6.7 Interpretation of the data At this point it is worth pointing out that there a re multiple inter-relationships between issues and concepts, as shown by the data 13 . The purpose of meetings was to give Mauritians a chance to speak out on issues that the y consider important. The consultations were therefore not meant for argument s and debates but rather to obtain input from maximum stakeholders. What was very impo rtant was to ensure that as many issues as possible were flagged. In spite of c onfounding factors 14 related to each issue, the relative importance of an issue to Mauri tians is, in itself, interesting. 13 For instance, cleaner energy would have environmen tal, economic, and social dimensions. 14 Although their overall effects are considered negli gible, several confounding factors are pointed out, in Annex 8. Far more serious would be pre-emptive designs of working groups, based on the advice of consultant( s), as this may have a direct effect on how policy issues are prioritised, or even what may end up in the pol icy. 36 6.8 Results by Special Interest Groups Rather than only consider all input clumped togethe r, data was also considered at the Special Interest Group (SIG) level. In the interest of keeping the Green Paper short, the bulk of the data are presented in Annex 8. Thes e results are, however, very important as they include trends that are masked by the analysis of combined input presented in the sections above. Such trends may he lp in the legal and institutional review studies, as well as guide the design of futu re consultations, including the composition of working groups. As an example, the r esults for the Fisheries SIG are presented below: 37 6.8.1 The Fisheries Special Interest Group as an ex ample Figure 6: Views of the fisheries sector on issues p ertaining to sustainability The stakeholders from the fishery sector 15 were concerned about laws and regulations pertaining to fishery and marine resources, which a ccounted for 24% of their input. It was felt that the laws and regulations either needed to be e nforced, or reviewed. One of the key issues identified by the stakeholders was the conflict bet ween tourism activities and fishers (18%). It 15 Data were combined for local fishing associations, net fishermen, chilled fish fisheries and bank ope rators. 38 was discussed that these conflicts needed to be add ressed through strategic ways in order to attain sustainable development. Several important points came out from fisheries me etings that had an implication on policy formulation: 1. The legal machinery was considered a key player in this sector, and legal review or deficiencies in enforcement were flagged as obstacl es to sustainable development; 2. Conflict between two important economic sectors sur faced regularly, namely between tourism and fisheries, and this has several implica tions for policy. Firstly, a balance may need to be found between sectors when it comes to the use of the marine environment. Secondly, mechanisms need to be develo ped and/or measures built into the policy to mitigate or adjudicate over sectoral conflicts. Thirdly, the policy may require the development of stronger integration in Government or at the very least coordinating bodies between sectors, or a coordinat ing body that will guide policy implementation; 3. Fishers were also highly concerned about the overus e and degradation of lagoons, pointing to the need for multiple-sector, multiple- use regimes in the inshore waters, such as implementation of lagoon management plans; 4. Input from the fishing association at Le Morne Vill age pointed very strongly to the need to balance tourism activities, lack of access to land for the creation of alternative livelihood, the preservation of World Heritage Site s, the control of land-based pollution sources from industrial and agricultural run-off, and fishing in and outside the lagoon and in reef breaks. No single policy or law can address, or attempt to achieve a balance between these issues with the res ult that very difficult decisions are then moved into the political arena without a frame work within which they can be made. 6.8.2 Summary of Special Interest Groups meetings Special Interest Groups (SIGs) analyses are present ed in Annex 8. Table 5 below only presents broad results in terms of prioritising iss ues. By ranking the issues mentioned by the SIGs in order of priority, waste (solid waste management, other waste management and waste recycling) had the highest sco re (scoring 45) energy (clean energy, transport and energy efficiency), had the s econd highest score, (scoring 44). Law and enforcement ranked 3 rd (scoring 27), while social issues and awareness ranked 4 th and 5 th (scoring 19 and 15, respectively). Other issues wi th a frequency greater than 10% included; green buildings, green s pace, cultural issues, efficient transport, pollution control, low cost housing, res earch and development and water 39 management. Energy issues, waste issues, laws and e nforcement, social issues and awareness were the main priorities that needed to b e addressed in order to get Mauritius on a sustainable trajectory. Table 4: Ranking of issues flagged by the SIGs with a frequency greater than 10% Issues 1st 2nd 3rd 4th 5th Score Waste 16 5, 5, 5, 5 4, 4, 4 3, 3, 3 2 1, 1 45 Energy 17 5, 5, 5 4, 4, 4, 4 3, 3, 3 2, 2 44 Laws and enforcement 5, 5 4, 4, 4 3 2 27 Social issues 5, 5, 5 4 19 Awareness 5 4 3, 3 15 Green buildings 4 2 6 Green Space 5 5 Cultural issues 5 5 Efficient transport 4 4 Pollution control 4 4 Low cost housing 2 2 Research and development 2 2 Water management 1 1 6.8.3 Broad trends from other Special Interest Grou ps Although the results from each SIG (see Annex 8) ca n be used in Phase 2, the following interesting trends were observed across t he different SIGs: Discussions revealed many inter-sectoral links, for example discussions in the Health SIG revealed links between health, lifestyle and en vironment. What will be important in a legal review is to determine how such factors are taken care of in the existing legislation. About 19 % of the issues raised by the participants from the local and District Council level (Figure 7) were directed towards the need for green spaces around the Island. It is precisely at the local level where land issues a re felt strongest. The need for controlling pollution came out with equal weight as the need for green spaces, while the need for adequate laws and enforcement (13%) wa s rated also as one of the top priorities for sustainable development. 16 Waste refers to a combination of solid waste manag ement, waste management and waste recycling. 17 Energy refers to a combination of clean energy and transport and energy efficiency. 40 Figure 7: Views from the Local Authorities Interestingly, the public infrastructure SIG again put more emphasis on the provision of adequate laws and enforcement (30%), followed by green building, preservation of marine resources (relating to the effects of coasta l infrastructure), low cost housing and planning. The NGO SIG represented by MACOSS indicated that so cial issues (37%) were of major concern to the general population of Mauritiu s, as well as the need to adopt the Reduce, Reuse and Recycle concept (10%). The stakeholders in the tourism sector indicated th at the need for clean energy and transportation (17%), adequate laws and regulations (12%) and energy efficiency (10%), were some of the key issues that need to be addressed. Biodiversity conservation ranked 5 th (7%), yet concern with tourism impacts scored a me re 3%. Considering the well-known, and vast social and env ironmental impacts that tourism has, a need for higher levels of awareness is indic ated here - among planners, decision-makers and operators. Such needs can be ac commodated in the Action Plan. 6.8.4 Views of the inhabitants of Rodrigues The inhabitants of Rodrigues were relatively more c oncerned about biodiversity conservation (16%), awareness and high unemployment rate. Water resources management also featured high on the agenda. Partic ipants were very proud of the plans they had in place already. They said that they want ed to see more implementation. They requested that the Sustainable Integrated Development Plan for Rodrigues (2009) be used as input into the policy f ormulation process in addition to input from meetings. Village presidents stated that they would welcome ground level participation. 41 Figure 8: Views of the inhabitants of Rodrigues on issues pertaining to sustainability In the mere two days that the General Facilitator v isited Rodrigues, it became clear that the inhabitants were very eager to be part of the ongoing policy process. 6.8.5 Changing the term \"Maurice Ile Durable\" to Ma urice Iles Durables A special plea was made in Rodrigues that the phras e Maurice Ile Durable be changed to Maurice Iles Durables , to reflect the inclusion of all the islands in th e process, as well as the branding identity. The idea was supported by parties from the mainland, but this clearly is a Cabinet decision co nsidering that the branding of the concept is already in progress. The change could li kely be effected without any significant consequences, further reflecting unity in the Republic of Mauritius in its quest for sustainability. 42 7 Input from Government 7.1 How Ministries and parastatal bodies viewed sus tainability? When the question \"What does sustainability mean?\" was asked, the answers of the Ministries displayed a high level of understanding of the term \"sustainability\". Their input is condensed below: Sustainability means using the available limited resources to sat isfy our own needs without compromising the ability of future generati ons to meet their needs. It thus calls for a disciplined way of living where each in dividual is conscious of what his or her actions entail in terms of affecting our living environment. Sustainability relates to sustainable development in areas of energy, environ ment, economic and social development. The objective is ultimately to do bett er with less and to take appropriate and timely measures in the present so as to assure a better future for the next generation. Sustainability is the ability to continue an action without the r isk of failure or collapse. It implies that an action can be continue d indefinitely with little, and manageable, impact on the environment. This require s that human beings use resources at a rate that allows for their replenish ment. It also means the judicious and efficient use of resources in the present times so that meeting the needs of the future generations are not adversely affected. When referr ing to the concept of sustainable development, this means that whatever development i s undertaken, the considerations of the economy, the environment and the social aspe cts should be well balanced. For a development model to be sustainable, it has also to be financially and fiscally sustainable so as not to overburden future generati ons with debts. Sustainability encompasses a pronounced sense of concern and empa thy for others and a thorough understanding of major technical and technological shifts capable of affecting development. It includes socio-economic, political, cultural and bio-physical areas and attitudes that enable us, individually an d collectively, to forge a peaceful and sustainable co-existence with the human, as wel l as physical and material environment. Sustainability requires an improvement in the quality of life and health of all people in the world without exceeding the ea rth's carrying capacity. It is the pursuit of economic development whilst limiting its impact on environmental resources. It requires that measures be taken to pr omote long term competitiveness of an economy in a productive, safe and decent working environment. Sustainability also involves reducing the consumption of all natu ral resources, maximizing energy efficiency and adopting eco-frien dly practices and lifestyles. In an 43 environmental context, sustainability equates to re ducing the amount of resources we use and buy, and the waste and emissions that we pr oduce. We need to think \"\u00e9colo\" ! eat \"\u00e9colo \"! live \"\u00e9colo\" , to ensure socio-economic development with minimum impact on our climate. Sustainability can also be e xpressed in the simple terms: \"Leave the world better than you found it, take no m ore than you need, try not to harm life or the environment, make amends if you do \" . It requires the reconciliation of environmental, social and economic demands - the th ree pillars of sustainability. Sustainability is a wide ranging term that can be applied to ever y facet of life. It relates to the safe, secure and environmentally sou nd resource management system which is based on internationally agreed upon stand ards. It includes environmental, economic and social responsibilities; and encompass es cultural aspects as well. The gender dimension is important, and both women and m en must be empowered through the implementation of programmes, so they c an fully enjoy their human rights and are equal partners in decision making to shape economic, environmental and social and cultural development and reap the be nefits thereof. 7.2 The Government machinery in action Mauritius has a sophisticated and organised governm ent. Each Ministry and parastatal body were asked to supply their Visions and Mission s (see also: www.gov.mu), their mandates referring to sustainability or sustainable development, and the issues and processes in relation to sustainability that their organisation addresses. These data 18 were intended as a first step towards an institutio nal analysis. However, the institutional analysis was deferred to Phase 2. Aft er initial analysis 19 , input showed widely varying engagement with sustainable developm ent-related issues, ranging from the superficial to detailed and extensive enga gement (like in the case of the MoESD). The main lessons learnt here is that, by fa r not all Ministries and parastatal bodies are on the same wavelength and disparities w ill need to be addressed at some point in an institutional analysis. 7.3 Issues that are currently not being addressed Ministries and parastatal bodies were requested to identify areas that are not currently being addressed or covered, yet in their opinion, w ould be required for Mauritius to be placed on a sustainable trajectory. Issues are pres ented in Annex 9. Some of the ones that ought to be addressed in a governance section of the policy, included: 18 Raw data is available from the PMO Steering Commit tee. 19 Results are not presented here in the interest of space and because after the 2010 elections new Mini stries were created while others were restructured. 44 1. Further research on consumer behaviour is needed to better guide directions of Ministries 2. Culture-sensitive issues not clearly reflected in t he education curriculum 3. A need for user-friendly tools for sustainable deve lopment and health 20 4. Social and economic issues related to sustainabilit y to be further considered 5. Review agricultural land released for other uses. 6. Improved policy enforcement 7. Enhanced monitoring of conditions imposed on develo pments by relevant authorities 8. Provide specialised skills for a knowledge and inno vation based economy that can compete better in the global trading arena 9. Integrate traffic and road safety aspects into all land-use planning 10. Collect and archive data on vehicle use, engine tec hnology, emission control technologies for better assessment of emissions and higher reporting accuracy 11. Aggressive education and awareness campaigns are ne eded 7.4 Gaps, obstacles, and difficulties The gaps, obstacles, difficulties and potential sol utions related to institutional performance included the following: 1. Existing laws 21 that can no longer respond effectively to the need s of the fast- growing Mauritius economy need to be reviewed 2. Planning responsibility to be clearly defined and a llocated 3. Inadequate lengthy procedures for plan-making, appr ovals, appeals and enforcement 4. Insufficient human resource in many Ministries 5. Lack of encouragement and continuous capacity build ing among staff 6. Lack of financial resources 7. A need for specialised skills 8. A need for legislative review 9. Need for improvement of the land tenure system 10. Special and Personal interests cause non-alignment of the visions of different stakeholders, causing conflicts and problems 11. Absence of an integrated policy for sustainability per se , was caused by the restrictive perception of the term that has traditi onally been associated with environmental concerns exclusively 20 E.g. health impact assessments, national, health p lanning in the national, regional and local environ ment, and local environment and health auditing. 21 E.g. the Town and Country Planning (TCP) Act which dates back to 1954. 45 12. Difficulties in changing mindsets are the result of sheer conservatism, and more exposure is needed 13. Enhancement of institutional monitoring mechanisms 14. Inadequate collective participation in decision mak ing process resulting in poor ownership/stewardship 7.5 Overlaps (if any) with other Ministries and par astatal bodies Ministries and parastatal bodies were asked what ov erlaps, if any, they had with other such entities. The main answer was that there are n o sufficient channels for information exchange among Ministries resulting, in some cases in duplication of work. In addition there is a need for an enhanced m echanism for the coordination and implementation of programmes, legislations and mand ates. 7.6 Recommendations from Ministries to enhance perf ormance The following recommendations were made by the Mini stries as a strategy to get Mauritius on a sustainable trajectory: 1. Consolidating and harmonising existing laws to make it in line with the current philosophy & requirements of the country; 2. Improved coordination among those Ministries having responsibility for the different aspects of land use planning and the Mini stry of Finance and Economic Development, so that the NDS (land use planning fra mework) can be fully supportive and integrated into the Government's nat ional socio-economic goals and objectives and its PSIP; 3. Encourage further dialogue and collaboration with t he private sector so that the major programmes and projects of each sector are in tegrated as effectively as possible to the benefit of all Mauritians; 4. Improve national-local level cooperation in land us e planning through the provision of consistent and up-to-date advice to Lo cal Authorities so that the local developments are in line with wider national develo pment principles and policies; 5. Ongoing institutional strengthening and capacity bu ilding is necessary; 6. Transparency and good governance principles to ensu re a planned development of the country, where it will be pleasant to live and work, where business can thrive and prosper and where the natural beauty of the cou ntry will be preserved for the benefit of generations to come; 7. Establishment of a Centralized Agency to monitor an d enforce all existing laws and regulations; 8. Updating of legislations; 9. Consumer education and information on judicious use of resources; 10. Sustained Awareness campaigns on consumer rights, i nterests and responsibilities; 46 11. Cross-sectoral and inter-sectoral coordination and harmonized actions (e.g. between energy, health, education, environment) at the respective levels; 12. Continuous decentralised actions to get health assi stance to people and communities that need it; 13. Mobilization of adequate additional funding; 14. Setting up of appropriate sectoral information syst ems targeting the public; 15. Building and maintaining human resources for health ; 16. Greater sensitization on sustainable development an d its relevance and application to our daily work; 17. Promotion of waste segregation and recycling; 18. Sustained sensitization programmes in schools/colle ges/tertiary institutions to promote the concept of sustainability and developme nt. 7.8 Main points The main points made by Ministries and parastatal b odies revolved around comprehensive legal and institutional review, capac ity building, coordination among institutions, increase in the efficacy of enforceme nt and, monitoring of sustainability parameters. Integrated governance would go a long way to help Government to perform its functions effectively and transparently . These issues can be readily addressed in a National Policy for a Sustainable Re public of Mauritius. 8 Dialogue in action: common ground, synergies and gaps In order to assess gaps between the peoples' needs and Government actions, the Ministerial mandates defined by the visions, missio ns and objectives were compared to the issues raised by the general public (for ful l details see Annex 10). For each issue raised, the Ministry mandate that best addres sed the issue was determined. Most Ministerial mandates were provided through the ques tionnaires sent to the Ministries. The Ministry of Fisheries and Rodrigues and Ministr y of Energy and Public Utilities mandates were obtained from the official Government website, www.gov.mu. Most of the issues raised by the general public cou ld easily be designated to a particular Ministry except those issues related to governance. Mauritians want their Government to lead by example, by fighting corrupti on, ensuring dialogue with civil society (unions, NGOs etc), and practising good gov ernance (see also section 6.5), There should be efficiency in planning and the Gove rnment should provide funds, legislations and determine what concrete actions ar e needed to promote the implementation of MID. People wish the Government to initiate more actions to move the country towards sustainability. Emphasis in the MID should be on th e drawing up of an action plan 47 which will drive the country towards sustainable de velopment. In addition, it is important to make it clear at this stage (in the po licy formulation process) on what is sustainable and what is not. Other issues of govern ance such as channelling of funds (CSR funds), support of institutions such as local governments, etc. were considered pertinent to sustainable governance for the Republi c of Mauritius. A stocktaking exercise of exactly where we stand in the pursuit o f sustainability was considered necessary and the results could later be used as a basis for monitoring and evaluation. 9 Our National Vision 9.1 Developing the National Vision The biggest challenge for social democracy today is to articulate coherent policies based on a common shared vision for society. Withou t this vision there will be no single guiding light for Mauritius on the way ahead . The National Vision defines the desired or intended future state of our country in terms of our fundamental objective, which is the attainment of a Sustainable Mauritius. The Vision is a statement that embodies a long-term view, describing the kind of c ountry we want to live in, and how we want to live there. 9.2 Missions A vision statement is often followed by missions. T he difference between a vision statement and a mission statement is that a vision statement focuses on the country's future, while a the mission statement(s) focuses on the country's present state and constitutes a set of actions that can be taken in p ursuit of a Sustainable Mauritius. When the working groups are convened in Phase 2, it may be useful to develop a set of missions, or mission statements that will form t he pillars of the policy itself. 9.3 Proposals for a National Vision The development of a vision is a process in itself. To arrive at the Draft National Vision in the Green Paper, the following steps were taken : Firstly, all literature relating to the Maurice Ile Durable Concept was studied, including the statements of the Prime Minister when the concept was first introduced to the nation. The main result is that not only ene rgy, but all aspects of life that pertains to a sustainable Mauritius needs to be inc orporated into the National Vision. Secondly, the draft visions of the Special Interest Groups (Annex 4) were broken down into their basic components, cross referenced with the views of the Ministries on sustainability, and combined into a Draft Combined National Vision that will be further discussed and refined during Phase 2. 48 Draft Combined National Vision We the people of Mauritius want to live in a countr y where environmental, social and economic concerns are carefully balanced in a f air and just manner. We want our nation to be educated, with appropriate training an d public awareness building incorporated in all policy frameworks, to ensure th e development of our human resource to its fullest potential, regardless of ge nder and ethnicity. We want an efficient and prosperous economic sector enjoying continuous high level support in the implementation of sustainable outcom es. Our natural resources should be efficiently protected and monitored, properly re searched, and used in sustainable ways. We recognise the management of resources as a shared responsibility of all users. We dream of a nation where unethical practices and activities are prohibited, where people are responsible and respectful of others and the environment, and where the rule of law is applied without exception. We want a non-corrupt, good governance system in which society is secure, where our medica l and social needs are taken care of, and where political agendas are geared to the b enefit of our green island. We want a nation where innovative methods are devel oped to foster social, economic, political and environmental well-being, a nd in which our cultural values and heritage can flourish. Our nation should be sel f-sufficient and self-reliant, accountable and transparent in all its affairs. Con scious of the limits of our land and resources we should plan our country well. We want our nation to have eco-friendly transport f acilities, where all Mauritians have more access to free green leisure spaces and b eaches, to eco-friendly transport facilities, and a pollution-free environment in whi ch we are less reliant on fossil fuels. Our biodiversity, pristine natural habitats and scenic landscapes as a source of ongoing enjoyment and spiritual nourishment must be preserved for posterity. We want to live in a land that is fair, green, crim e-free, safe and secure, providing equal opportunities for all, and where we can pursu e our vision in a spirit of brotherhood. Thirdly, considering the importance of our youth as the next generation whose right to a good life in a future Mauritius must be protected , the proposed Vision from the National Youth Summit was measured against the Draft Combined National Vision . Vision from the National Youth Summit We, the Youth of Mauritius, want to live in a green and pollution-free country in which social, cultural, political, environmental an d economic dimensions are carefully considered and balanced with sustainabili ty as our common goal. Our human resource should be developed to its fullest p otential in all of our islands, so 49 the necessary creativity and innovation can be unlo cked that will sustain us into the future. We recognize that education and scientific endeavour, self-sufficiency, transparency, and thorough planning and implementat ion are cornerstones in the pursuit of a sustainable and secure Mauritius, wher e the building of a healthy, equitable and all-inclusive society is our collecti ve aim and responsibility, not only to secure our own future but also to serve as a mod el to the world. It was found that the shorter Vision from the Natio nal Youth Summit contained all the elements of the Combined Vision although in a highl y condensed format. 9.4 The Way Forward The following steps are suggested for the developme nt of a National Vision for Mauritius: 1. The two visions are published in the press with a d eadline for further comment. This will confirm that all Mauritians had a chance to contribute to the National Common Shared Vision. At the same t ime this will raise awareness for Phase 2. 2. An Inter-Ministerial Committee will be set up to co nsider both the Draft Combined National Vision and the one proposed at th e National Youth Summit to come up with a draft National Common Shar ed Vision for the Republic of Mauritius, taking into consideration co mments from the public. 3. The National Common Shared Vision will be used to g uide formulation of the National MID policy. 50 10 Towards a National Policy 10.1 Current Status Phase 1 of the policy formulation process as approv ed by Cabinet in December 2009 has been completed. The ground work has been laid, and the principles of good policy making and the design of the process have been acce pted by all, and have proved to be effective in the Mauritian context. The enthusia sm displayed by the people of the Republic of Mauritius during consultative meetings so far, and the existence of a Draft National Vision, is ample evidence of the nat ion's readiness to proceed. The Government machinery has revealed a similar readine ss to be engaged fully in the formulation of the policy. The shift from the then MREPU to the MoESD as the new lead Ministry has occurred and the latter is now em barking on the policy formulation process to come up with the MID Policy, Strategy an d Action Plan by early 2012. 10.2 Gap analysis At this point it would be appropriate to consider a gap analysis of the overall status of the process, which may enlighten certain particular s of the process that lies ahead. The simple SWOT analysis alludes to points that are addressed in section 11 below. Strengths Weaknesses Strong leadership exists at the Government level. Political commitment at the highest levels is not to be doubted. In the private sector, top companies are also showing the way by adopting sustainable modes of operation and construction. Well executed awareness campaign, though it can be improved must be ongoing Initiative welcomed by population as demonstrated by enthusiastic participation. Highly interactive information gathering sessions. Whereas top level commitment at political level is very strong, on the other hand this is not adequately reflected throughout the civil service. The same can be said for the private sector. Interaction between SIGs operating in similar sectors should have been included (e.g. tourism and fisheries). The percentages obtained reflect concerns in the mind of the population at the time of National Consultations. At another times, priorities may be different 22 . Consultation has not been fully inclusive and did not penetrate entire population. Additional SIGs such as donor community could have been 22 For instance in a time of drought, water issues wi ll be more prominent as an issue. 51 consulted. Willingness of the SIGs to adopt sustainable livelihoods not quantified. Opportunities Threats The formulation of the white paper must be such that it addresses issues at their source (e.g. developing a sustainable culture within all spheres of the society). The process provides the opportunity for the development of a sustainability index suited for the Mauritian context. This will enable the progress of MID to be tracked over the years to come. Needs must be balanced with wants (there can be prioritisation as well as transitional periods between now and the desired state). Willingness to pay for a sustainable society should be examined more in depth. Care must be taken that lobbies do not deviate the project from its intended goals. The initiative must not be seen as a political agenda. Themes should not be tackled in isolation. Interrelationships should be clearly defined for each sector. The perception that MID project is stagnating due to the delays encountered and lack of visibility of tangible results. Private sector and population in general seem over reliant on the Government to initiate eco- projects and to finance them. Institutional mandates can be unclear and this may result in overlapping of responsibilities, bottleneck situations, conflicts and delays at later stages. Obsolete laws, gaps in the legal machinery and difficulties in enforcement may hamper implementation. 11 The Process ahead 11.1 Continuing awareness raising Awareness was flagged as one of the most prominent issues in the input received during the national consultations. Although the nat ion responded well to the short awareness campaign 23 , the raising of awareness should be a continuing process, and should occur at different levels. Also, in the cont ext of MID the raising of awareness has more than one purpose, although different tiers of awareness activities can be run concurrently in a well-planned and coordinated awar eness campaign. It is important that the different components and tiers of an aware ness campaign are distinct and 23 The public awareness campaign started on 22 Februa ry and ended on 28 March, 2010. 52 have their purposes well defined, although they can fall under a single brand identity, the MID overall concept. For instance, one set of activities can be aimed at raising awareness on MID issues in general, while another tier can focus specifically on raising awareness on the policy formulation process itself. In the first instance, there can be a MID Film Festival 24 , the showcasing of 'local heroes' (such as people or com panies involved in organic farming, or engaged in local activities that relate to MID) on MBC, in-depth feature articles in the press, etc. Most importantly, an ar ray of carefully identified actors can be co-opted into implementing a broad-based MID awa reness raising campaign, which instantly will help to promote ownership. Publicising the policy formulation process would ad dress issues such as 'why you should participate' and 'how and where to participa te'. Generally short clips on television, advertisements in news-papers, and the activation of networks can be very effective. Other mechanisms can include an interact ive website which tends to enrich input, especially if an online library of articles and news clippings form part of it, as well as other mechanisms that provide access to inf ormation. From now on, what is required is a carefully designed Public Awareness a nd Information Dissemination (PA&ID) campaign. Public awareness is an ongoing commitment. During t he current year mechanisms can be developed for this purpose, including the instal lation of a regular television programme, embedding PA&ID activities in CSR progra mmes, having an annual National Youth Summit or MID Week (both activities have proven popular). Such mechanisms and activities may gradually be de-coupl ed from the overall MID publicity campaign to foster independence and self- reliance so they can become sustainable in themselves. 11.2 Further consultations The MID project belongs to all of us No one can be left out here. The Prime Minister sta ted that \"The MID project belongs to the Mauritian nation...it belongs to each and ev ery one of us.\" Clearly, if an elitist approach is taken that involves only some people th en it cannot be said that the MID process is one in which Mauritius 'turns a new page '. Therefore the promise was made by the Deputy Prime Minister during the launch ing of national consultations that every Mauritian who wishes to give input will have the chance to do so. With 24 This may take the form of a competition such as on e organized by an NGO before consultations started, or a film festival where good documentaries and even fea ture films with a sustainability theme are shown. 53 national elections 2010, it was not possible to con tinue consultations beyond a certain point, to avoid politicisation of inputs. Although consultations have been very broad- based so far, completely inclusive consultation wil l be achieved only in Phase 2. Drawing on the 'lessons learned' during Phase 1, we are now in a far better position to keep the promise made to the nation. Local level consultation Most importantly, it should be recognised that the intended effects of the policy will be felt locally, by each and every one. Therefore c onsultation needs to penetrate to the local level. This is not nearly as difficult as it may seem at a first glance. Mauritius is a small and well-organised country. Considering tha t a typical consultative meeting took between 60 - 90 minutes, workshops can easily be accommodated in regular District, Municipal and Village Council meetings. I n a workshop with representatives from Local Authorities, several mechanisms were pro posed by which local level consultation can occur, and all of them are workabl e and can be activated easily. In some of them, councillors or officials at service p oints can be engaged. The point was made, both by Government officials and the citizens, that Village Councils are at leas t to some extent politicised and that not all ground level input may be solicited through this channel. However, there are other ways that are highly effective. The Local Economic Development (LED) approach that was used in Le Morne village enabled all sectors of society at the village level to provide input along four 25 dimensions of sustainable development, as well as to develop a vision for their village. The LED approach is effectively the same as the one used for the countr y as a whole but is applied holistically at the village level (see Annex 11). I mportant inputs were obtained that can significantly improve the policy process upstre am from the ground level 26 . It is highly recommended that local villages on the main island be given the opportunity to make this landmark process truly pervasive and rigo rous 27 . In Rodrigues there were 25 Social, environmental, economic and cultural dimens ions. 26 It was stated from the start that the Le Morne vil lage 'experiment' will be used as a template for th e consultative process at the village level; the LED approach yields similar outcomes though at a geogra phically smaller scale; the added advantage is that results can be used as useful input for the preparation of the the Strategy and Action Plan. Le Morne village experien ce shows that input additionally relate strongly to the 'Eco village' concept and will ensure that the beneficia ries are part of planning and implementation from t he start. 27 This can effectively be achieved by engaging socia l welfare centres, training CBOs in a one-day works hop, and making use of village halls (see Annex 11). It is estimated that this process, which need not cost much at all, can be accomplished over a period of 2-3 months. It is critical to acknowledge that the physical interface between the people and Government typically is at the lower tiers of government, such as at the Village Council level, and dialogue cannot be complete without interactions having taken place at such levels. This is where the 'top down, bottom up' approach is at its most functional. 54 strong calls to involve the villages, and this can be easily done through the village presidents who expressed their eagerness in this re gard. The meeting arranged with women in Flacq on April 1 , 2010, emphasized the fact that there are many Mauritians who cannot read, and who are not well versed in what MID means, not to mention the policy process itself. No netheless participants responded well in the meeting, and pointed to the possible en gagement of the welfare centres to reach some of the vulnerable groups, e.g. the unemp loyed youth. Open public meetings Open public meetings can act as a 'catch all' devic e; it will ensure broader consultation and direct participation of the public . Together with the local level meetings, which should not be restricted to any par ticular group of people, open public meetings will ensure the promise that 'every Mauritian who wanted to give input was able to do so', will be truly fulfilled. It is highly recommended that the same workshop met hodology be followed that was developed in Phase 1. It is also very important tha t rapporteurs and facilitators be properly trained so that results will be reliable a nd not influenced by the style of facilitation. That would affect credibility negativ ely and give skewed results. 11.3 Working Groups Thematic Working Groups The input received so far provides a very useful ba sis for defining thematic working groups in Phase 2. The purpose of thematic groups w ill be to take on board any issues that may have been missed, but specifically will be to explore specific themes and sectors in depth. It is important to point out the danger of rigorously pre-defined thematic working groups - precisely because policy making involves Government planning with the people, therefore working groups cannot be ent rusted to outside experts only. At the MID High Level Workshop in December 2010, fi ve axes were proposed as the '5Es', namely Energy, Environment, Education, Emplo yment and Equity. Comparing input from the workshops in Phase 1 to the componen ts proposed for the 5Es, showed a high degree of correlation, though some input may not be readily classified readily into the 5Es (see Annex 12). However, at the stage of the Green Paper this is not considered an obstacle to free and open process, as policy formulation is an ongoing process and the formulation of the 5Es provides use ful input from the higher hierarchy into what has evolved into a 'top down, b ottom up' process. 55 It may, for instance be useful to divide what has c lassically become known as the 'brown issues' which has generally become associate d with 'environment' and the 'green issues' that tends to be associated with 'ec ology', thus creating a sixth E namely Ecology. This would mean that biological end emism, for instance, will not be fall under the same category as Persistent Organic Pollutants (PoPs), or that ecological corridors are not treated by the same th ematic group that focuses on solid waste management - ecology and environment, even wh en treated in the broadest context, may simply be too wide to be treated as th e same \"E\". While Economy, another \"E\", may have been considere d cross-cutting in the 5 Es, it may be useful to treat it as a separate E consideri ng the importance of the economy in providing the means for addressing sustainability i ssues in the other Es. In addition, there have been a number of calls for a New Economi c Model, for which considerable effort and thinking will be needed, even in going a s far as the construction of a basic framework. Building on the axes of intervention in the December 2010 High Level Workshop, we may consider seven Es instead of five, and end up with the \"7 Es\". However, a number of other issues do not readily gr oup into the Es model, in particular those relating to governance, legal revi ew and institutional arrangements. Such considerations are crucial when it comes to im plementing a highly multi- sectoral policy, especially when a number of govern mental organisations may be involved. It is particularly significant that the P rime Minister included 'Equity' in this list, this being very much in line with the input f rom many people. Mauritius belongs to each and everyone and as such everyone should be able to obtain its fair share. Thus, the sub-classifications of Equity should make provision for addressing inequalities in the distribution of land and the di fferential access to resources 28 . Giving full recognition to, and building upon the u sefulness of the E model are best left to the beginnings of Phase 2, when a new team will be geared up to drive the policy formulation process to its conclusion. It is important that the thematic discussion groups should be of a varied composition , drawing on the different expertise that exists in Mauritius at all tiers of society (see section 4.7) Special Working Groups In addition to thematic workshops certain special w orking groups may be necessary to obtain in-depth input. NGOs have expressed a strong interest in having more time available than what is allotted to a usual consulta tive workshop. They may be encouraged to provide input in a format that will e asily feed into the policy 28 Such matters have well-known importance in the pur suit of sustainability and in Mauritius, like in ma ny other countries, are legacies of the past (see reference to Stigliz 2011, in section 3.2). 56 formulation process 29 . Groups such as the Joint Economic Council (JEC) c an also be usefully engaged to provide structured input, as co uld other structured bodies such as the National Heritage Fund (NHF), the Aapravasi Gha t Trust Fund (AGTF) and the Le Morne Heritage Trust Fund (LMHTF). 11.4 Specialist Input Although already approved by Cabinet in 2009, the l egal review and the institutional mandates studies were not undertaken in Phase 1. Th ese studies must be considered during Phase 2. The institutional mandates study sh ould be conducted very interactively with Government officials. Many offic ials have pointed out the need to effectively address issues of coordination, cohesio n and other institutional aspects without which a multi-sectoral policy such as the National Policy for a Sustainable Mauritius will lack the enabling environment needed for impl ementation, and will never work to its full potential. One message that clearly stands out from Phase 1 is that the needs and aspirations of the people, and their National Vision, do not diffe r significantly from how Government views sustainability and how the Ministr ies see their mandates in relation to sustainable pursuits. While some gaps and obstac les have been identified, the broad overall ambitions are the same. Yet, somehow a cert ain level of frustration about 'why things don't work as they should' was noticeab le throughout the national consultations. Nonetheless, the eagerness to work w ith Government was always there. The most likely answer does not lie in the existenc e of opposing views, but rather in deficiencies in the vehicle we have at our disposal to travel to the destination we want to reach. Integrated governance is clearly what is needed. Without it the differen t parts of the vehicle cannot work together optimally to drive it forward. In addition to a reconfiguration of the Government machinery (whic h are unlikely to be extensive considering the good governance that already exists in Mauritius), legal review is necessary. Where the institutional arrangements cou ld be viewed as a vehicle at our disposal, laws and regulations will be the fuel nec essary to drive it. One without the other will not work. It is too early to tell whether new laws will be re quired, or, amendments be brought to the existing legislation to provide the legal basis for the implementation of the policy. It must be pointed out that a policy has a long lif etime, as would be expected in a situation where a country embarks in a new directio n, and that legal instruments may gradually be added as the need for them becomes app arent. Certainly this policy is a long-term prospect, in contrast with Strategies suc h as Vision 2020 which have a 29 Most input obtained thus far from NGOs consisted of manifestos, lengthy discussion documents, etc. Thi s made conversion to the current input format possibl e though labour intensive; however, the problem wil l not apply to situations where NGOs can give input into structured thematic working groups. 57 limited lifetime and sometimes are overtaken by cha nging and new realities, long before their official shelf life expires. The Strategy should be based on the policy; however it need not wait for the completion of the policy before actions can start. It is expected to have discrete timelines reflecting immediate, mid-term and longer terms goals. Its practical output will be an Action Plan that may need to be updated periodically, or adjusted to changing circumstances. Such matters, too, fall in the ambit of Phase 2. 11.5 Development of a new Flowchart A very detailed flowchart for Phase 2 can now be wo rked out, drawing on the policy formulation process until now, as well as the direc tion provided at the High Level Workshop of December 2010. Milestones in the flowch art will be a Draft White Paper, which is effectively a Draft Policy until en dorsement by Cabinet, a Draft MID Strategy and a Draft MID Action Plan. It is importa nt not to put the cart in front of the ox, and to have a clear understanding of the causal functional relationships between policy, strategy and action plan. Very important will be at what point exactly the Wo rking Groups and Specialist Studies feed into the process; these and other matt ers should be agreed upon by the lead Ministry. After all, it is this Ministry that will have to live with the realities that the process flowchart will impose on it. Policy for mulation is a Government led process and provides a unique opportunity for Gover nment and the people to embark on the road toward sustainable development. Fortunately the Ministry of Environment and Sustain able Development (MoESD) has vast experience and many resources it can draw on, including a thorough understanding of international conventions and best practices, internationally and locally 30 . The MoESD will also ensure that all other Ministr ies and stakeholders are fully on board as partners in the process. This wil l be key to the evolution of even higher levels of cooperation and integrated governa nce that currently exist, and a prerequisite for the effective implementation of th e overarching and multi-sectoral National Policy for a Sustainable Mauritius . 30 The excellent performance of the Ministry of Enviro nment and Sustainable Development over the past fiv e years has been demonstrated internationally through the Yale Index of Environmental Performance which ranked Mauritius sixth in the World with regard to environmental protection. 58 12 List of References Alladin, I (1993).

ntil the writing of the Green Paper. Annex 6 describes in further detail ho w the national consultation process was managed and run, including the entities involve d in its management, the activities conducted, the number of meetings, and so on. Raw d ata are presented as there were received in order to safeguard authenticity. 1.1 Managing the process The Ministry of Renewable Energy and Public Utiliti es (MREPU), the then lead Ministry under whose aegis the Maurice Ile Durable Fund (MID F) operated was assigned the task of planning and implementing the policy process. Th e MREPU set up an Organising Committee (OC) to monitor the implementation of the National Policy Process. The committee was responsible for the proper organisati on of the national consultations, monitoring the implementation of the work plan and meetings, keeping track records of progress, addressing difficulties that cropped up. The OC, which had its first meeting on 20 January 2 010, was constituted as follows: Table 1: Members of the Organising Committee Names Designation Mrs. N. Nababsing Permanent Secretary, MEPU (Chairperson) Mr O. Mahomed Chairperson MID Steering Committee Mr. J. Kwok Vice Chairperson, MIDF Mr D. Dassaye Secretary, MIDF Mr M. Desha Head of Operations, Technical Support Unit, MIDF Mr. J.P Hardy Member Mr. S. Ramchurn Representative of UNDP Mrs. A. D'Arifat L\u00e9clezio Communications Officer, Technical Support Unit Mrs. D. Tatur Ramasamy Technical Officer, Technical Support Unit Dr K. Elahee Rep of University of Mauritius Mr. B. Heeroah Executive Officer, MID Steering Committee Unit 1 Adapted from the TSU Report: Report on phase one o f the Maurice Ile Durable Policy Process National Consultations (February - April 2010). 2 Dr F. Odendaal UNDP Consultant, General Facilitator Mr R. Deesoruth Administrative Officer, Technical Support Unit, MID F (Secretary) Finally, the PMO Steering Committee for Maurice Ile Durable (MID), consisting of representatives of all Ministries and chaired by Mr Osman Mahomed, would facilitate input from Ministries and oversee the policy formul ation process. 1.2 Awareness Campaign and Communication An awareness campaign was launched on the 22 nd February 2010 and ended on 28 th March 2010. Its aim was to sensitise the public on the importance of sustainable development and of the elaboration of a policy for MID, and invite them to participate and contribute to the policy formulation. A Televis ion (TV) clip of 30 secs, a radio clip of 30 secs, as well as a press artwork (See Attachment 1 to Annex 1 ) were designed and broadcasted / published. The campaign started on the 22 nd of February 2010 and ended on the 28 th of March 2010. a) Launching: The national consultation process was officially launched by the Deputy Prime Minister (DPM), Hon. A.R Beebeejaun on 18 Feb ruary 2010. b) Communiqu\u00e9s : Communiqu\u00e9s were published and broadcasted in ord er to invite people as per an established media plan to send the ir proposals to the MIDF. c) Press releases: Several press releases and briefs on SIG meetings were prepared and sent to the media. d) Press Conference: A press conference was held on the 3rd of February 2010, where Dr F. Odendaal and Mr O. Mahomed explained the proc ess (See Attachment 2 to Annex 1 for full press article). e) Radio Talk: Mr O. Mahomed and Dr Elahee participated in a radi o talk on Radio Plus. f) Interviews: Dr Odendaal has been interviewed several times by the TV, radio, and press, as well as the Technical Support Unit's Comm unications Officer, and the Secretary of the MIDF. g) MBC Film: A film on sustainable development was designed by M BC, at the request of MEPU. The objective was to broadcast the film \"L 'ile Verte\" as an introduction to all Special Interest Group (SIG) meetings, but the product was commissioned late, and after an initial screening in Rodrigues was dee med ineffective for this purpose. 3 Dossier of Wednesday screened the film on 10 February 2010 . The National Consultations were also discussed in that programme . h) MIDF Website: Information on the consultation process, including briefs on the meetings held was uploaded on the MIDF website. 1.3 National Consultations The national consultation process included meetings with SIGs, input from Ministries and parastatal bodies, a National Youth Summit, and pub lic input through questionnaires, e- mails and letters. To speed up consultations in vie w of the then oncoming elections, additional rapporteurs and moderators, delegated by the respective Ministries, as well as from academia were trained by the General Facilitat or. The MREPU was supported in this task by the Technical Support Unit (TSU) set u p by the UNDP. The TSU played a key role in assisting the General Facilitator at va rious stages of the process and ultimately in keeping good records of the process (see the TSU report). The training sessions were held at the MREPU during the month of February 2010 . The MREPU also invited suggestions from civil society at large through sta ndard questionnaires, emails and letters. A National Youth Summit was organised for the parti cipation of secondary school students. 1.3.1 SIG meetings: SIGs consist of stakeholders who share common conce rns. The Technical Support Unit (TSU) and MIDF in collaboration with the relevant M inistries and organisations organised a series of consultative meetings with SI Gs (see Annex 2 for the list of meetings). The following SIGs were identified and a pproved by the OC: 4 1) Academia and Students 2) Agro Industry 3) Construction Industry 4) Culture 5) Education 6) Environment 7) Fisheries 8) Health 9) Industry/Export Associations 10) Information & Communication Technology 11) Land Transport and Shipping 12) Local Authorities 13) NGOs 14) Private Sector/Economic operators 15) Social Security 16) Tourism 17) Trade Unions 18) Water 19) Women 20) Youth & Sports Fifty SIG meetings had been held by April 2010 with SIGs and district and municipal officers on the main island of Mauritius, and presi dents of village committees in Rodrigues etc. Input was received from Agalega. The list of meetings held is included at Annex 2 . These meetings were organised by the Technical Supp ort Unit in collaboration with the MIDF Secretary and respective Ministries / organisations. The General Facilitator and TSU staff facilitated the meetings along with trained moderators and rapporteurs. The outcome of each meeting was usually a set of co ncerns, opportunities, views and other inputs. A sample list of issues arising from a typical SIG meeting is included at Annex 3 and in general a draft Vision was construct ed at the meeting and agreed upon by the participants. The various vision statements dev eloped are compiled at Annex 4. Plate 1: SIG meeting with UOM students, 22 February 2010 Plate 2: SIG meeting with Tourism operators 19 March 2010 5 Plate 3: SIG meeting with Women in Networking, 03 March 2010 1.3.2 SIG Meetings at Rodrigues and Agalega One of the principles of the consultation was that it would have to be as wide ranging and encompassing as possible. Thus no part of the R epublic of Mauritius would be left without an opportunity to express their views on Ma urice Ile Durable. Accordingly, consultations were held in Rodrigues and Agalega as well. On 26 and 27 March 2010, a delegation led by the General Facilitator, accompan ied by one representative of the MREPU and of the TSU. Several consultative meetings were held with the Environment Committee and the Sustainable Integrated Developmen t Plan for Rodrigues (SIDPR) Thematic Groups, the Deputy Chief Commissioner and the Commissioners, the representatives of Social associations, and preside nts of village committees. In addition, Representatives of the Outer Islands Development Co rporation (OIDC) also met and consulted inhabitants of Agalega in March 2010. Plate 4: SIG meeting with UTM students, 2 March 2010 6 1.3.3 Inputs from Ministries / Parastatals Ministries were requested to submit their views on sustainability, the vision and missions of the Ministry, their mandates in relatio n to sustainable development, issues, gaps and obstacles in their pursuit of sust ainable outcomes, legal and other instruments they had to their avail, what issues ou ght to be addressed but are not currently taken care of, overlaps with other Minist ries and recommendations on what needed to be put in place for success to be achieve d (see Annex 9). The PMO Steering Committee coordinated ministerial input via guiding questionnaires. The following Ministries were consulted: 1. Ministry of Agro Industry, Food Production & Security 2. Ministry for Consumer Protection and Citizens Charter 3. Ministry of Education, Culture & Human Resources 4. Ministry of Health and Quality of Life 5. Ministry of Housing and Lands 6. Ministry of Industry, Science & Research 7. Ministry of Labour, Industrial Relations and Employment 8. Ministry of Civil Service and Administrative Reforms 9. Prime Minister's Office: Meteorological Services 10. Ministry of Business, Enterprise and Co-operatives 11. Ministry of Women's Rights, Child Development & Family Welfare 12. Ministry of Environment and National Development Unit 13. Ministry of Public Infrastructure, Land Transport and Shipping 14. Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Regional Integration and International Trade 15. Ministry of Finance and Economic Empowerment 16. Attorney General's Office 17. Ministry of Youth and Sports 18. Ministry of Tourism, Leisure and External Communications 19. Ministry of Local Government, Rodrigues and Outer Islands 7 1.3.4 National Youth Summit A nationwide involvement of secondary schools was s pearheaded and organized by the Rajiv Gandhi Science Centre (RGSC), following a model that was tested during the 2009 MID Week. The objectives of the summit wer e to: Enable students from each secondary school to discu ss, under the guidance of their teachers, issues related to a Sustainable Mau ritius. Give students the opportunity to present their scho ol's vision of MID. RGSC was entrusted with the organisation of this ev ent. Rectors of all secondary schools were invited to encourage their students to reflect on the topic with the help of a supervising teacher. For this purpose, a form con taining the following questions was designed and sent to all secondary schools: a) What does MID mean to you? b) What are the issues related to sustainability? c) What are the opportunities related to becoming sust ainable? d) What can you do to become sustainable? e) Briefly state your vision for MID. The National Youth Summit was held on 31 March 2010 . Seventy colleges participated to the Summit, in which two representa tives of each school presented their vision of the sustainable development of Maur itius. To conclude the 2-day Summit, on the basis of the d raft prepared by students, the General Facilitator drafted a shared vision of MID which was discussed, revised, and agreed by all: We, the Youth of Mauritius, want to live in a green and pollution-free country in which social, cultural, political, environmental and econ omic dimensions are carefully considered and balanced with sustainability as our common goal . Our human resource should be developed to its fullest potential in all of our is lands, so the necessary creativity and innovation can be unlocked that will sustain us int o the future. We recognize that education and scientific endeavor, self-sufficiency, transpar ency, and thorough planning and implementation as cornerstones in the pursuit of a sustainable and secure Mauritius, where the building of a healthy, equitable and all-inclus ive society is our collective aim and responsibility, not only to secure our own future b ut also to serve as a model to the world. 8 Following the Summit all participating schools subm itted filled-in standard questionnaires. These questionnaires have been proc essed along with all other inputs in the analysis by the TSU (see Chapter 5 of the TS U report). 1.3.5 Questionnaires, e-mails and letters Two types of questionnaires (see Annex 5 & 6) were designed to solicit inputs from individuals and NGOs, regarding their views about s ustainability. These questionnaires were distributed during meetings or could also be downloaded from the MIDF website (http://midf.gov.mu) . The opportunity was also given to any individual wh o wished to make submissions to the policy formulation process by e-mail or letters . 1.4 Inputs Received Inputs to the policy formulation have been received through various channels such as SIG meetings, questionnaires, emails, letters etc. Table 2 below shows the types and number of inputs received. Table 2: Frequency of inputs received per category Types of Inputs No received SIG meetings (list of issues) 46 (50 meetings and 4 had no issues) Individual Inputs (free format) Emails 110 Letters 17 Reports and Publications 15 Feedback forms / questionnaires Standard (individual) 182 NGOs 7 Inputs from Ministries & Parastatal Bodies Ministries 19 Parastatal Bodies 6 TOTAL 402 9 1.5 Further consultations that are necessary Though much useful information was obtained, the co nsultations were by no means perfect nor fully inclusive of the Mauritian societ y. Youth that are not enrolled in secondary schools, Rodrigues, other pockets of soci ety such as people displaced from Diego Garcia, ground level NGOs and associations, d istrict and local government (municipalities and village councils) have yet to b e systematically consulted. Another way for anyone not falling into a particular group to participate, is through open public meetings, but they were not held. Initial co nsultations with private sector and commercial interests indicated that far more intens ive consultations will be necessary, for instance through working groups. 1.6 Status as at June 2010 The first phase of the consultations were launched on 19 February 2010, and ended at the beginning of April 2010. As elections were anno unced for May 2010, it was decided to withhold further consultations until the elections were over. Following the formation of the new Government, the MIDF has been in the process of being transferred to the Ministry of Environment and Sust ainable Development for some time. The new lead Ministry will now be re-launchin g the process in 2011. 10 Attachment 1 to Annex 1 11 Attachment 2 to Annex 1 MID: Le gouvernement devrait approuver une politiqu une politique nationale- exhaustive et cibl \u00e9e- l'autosuffisance.

Lalljee, Director of Centre for Consultancy & Contract Rese arch, UoM Dr. S. Facknath N. Ramjing , Administrative Officer, UoM. 1. While the authorities encourage consultations and n o restrictions are placed on such discussions, these are not sufficiently valued by a uthorities, and there is no significant action taken based on the consultations. 2. Sustainable Development (SD) does not deal only wit h energy. Therefore, although the MID project can remain with the MREPU, it shoul d be a holistic approach, cutting across all sectors. 3. The incentive provided in terms of avoiding wastes, using renewable energy sources, e.g. photovoltaic cells must be improved. One propo sal has been made in writing by an academic of UoM. 4. In spite of several recommendations made at differe nt levels, the Bills being debated do not include many recommendations made by academi cs. 5. While solar water heaters are being encouraged by G ovt., related issues such as efficiency, security, quality, guarantee, good desi gn of the apparatus are not being sufficiently ensured. It is mainly profit oriented. People also use electrical heaters in addition to solar water heaters, thus defeating the purpose of using alternative energy sources. 6. Similarly, there is no quality control of the Compa ct Fluorescent Light bulbs being encouraged by Government, and therefore they need t o be changed after 1 year, again defeating the purpose of sustainable use of energy. Moreover, disposal of these bulbs poses a problem since they contain mercury, which i s toxic to humans, animals and the environment. 7. Several members stated that the example must be set by the higher authorities (exemple vient de haut; walking their talk), and pe ople at the top of the hierarchies (practice what you preach). 8. The current definition of sustainability stresses m ainly the physical environment, and not sufficiently the human and cultural dimensions. It should also include economic and social aspects. 9. Current commercial practices concentrate entirely o n monetary gain, e.g. the short life of currently produced household appliances, necessi tating buying new ones every few years. 10. There is 'pollution of the human mentality', with e mphasis on material gain only (the profiteering mentality). This needs to change in or der to bring about a change in society. 11. Presently MIDF is benefitting commercial interests, and the rationale for allocation of funds needs to be changed. 12. Universities have research potential, globally as w ell as in Mauritius. 13. UoM has topics dealing with sustainability in many of its undergraduate and postgraduate programmes. 18 14. Academics can add value to the national situation a nd the consultation process, and have a key role to play, e.g. through their researc h and innovation, and as a think tank. 15. Academics must ponder on key issues in the present situation, e.g. consumerism, present paradigm of economic growth, current attitu des and mentalities, and should help define (or redefine ?) sustainability concepts . 16. Academics must be encouraged to voice out their opi nions regarding the situation in the country, and their views must be given serious consideration by the authorities. 17. Being small is not equal to being closed. Research should not depend only on Transfer of Technology, but should promote research on sustainability issues that are specific to Mauritius. Furthermore, there are a num ber of simple technologies that already have been researched and are available for application, e.g. use of black PVC pipes for water heating, research regarding mass tr ansportation. Such research should be encouraged, and also ways to develop it further for implementation nationally. 18. In order to realize the potential of academics in t his respect, more investment is needed in R & D nationally. Presently only < 0.1% of the national budget is allocated to research. 19. Most R & D, as well as the political efforts are cu rrently being concentrated towards energy management and essentially through a Transfe r of Technology approach. It is imperative that local, site-specific research and t echnology development should also be encouraged and funded. 20. Universities should be encouraged to publicise thei r research work, and patent it, wherever applicable, and put it to use for the bene fit of the nation. In Singapore, which is half the size of Mauritius b ut has 4-5 times the population of Mauritius, sustainability is a key co ncept. Sustainable Development in Singapore is ensured by a series of measures, which are normally planned and decided well in adva nce (long term Master Plans), and which are well advertised so people are aware of future Government activities. Guidelines and rules are set by Government and foll owed by all people, e.g. for standardization and regulating land area availa ble for particular activities. Some of the parameters that are used include effect on city biodiversity (how much flora/fauna is retained during construction), energy utilized in buildings, etc. There is a strong multi-agency commitment, and all people share a common vision and values. 21. Mauritius is one country that has reconciled Secula rism and Religion. 22. There is no policy yet on certain key issues, such as sorting and planning for solid waste management. One proposal: a Public Private Pa rtnership. 23. The decision-making process at present is not suffi ciently well structured. Focus groups should exist to discuss and help in the deci sion-making process. 24. While democracy must remain the basis of our countr y's governance, is there at times too much dependence on decision making through cons ensus? 19 25. Necessity is the mother of invention. People are mo re motivated to adopt a certain approach out of necessity, rather than from a sense of responsibility to the nation/environment, e.g. use of rainwater harvestin g devices in Rodrigues. 26. Does development have to be synonymous with environ mental degradation? Is there always a price to be paid for investment? 27. People must be encouraged to think about what they want for their future generations. 28. Are people willing to change their lifestyles? Only talk is not convincing enough. People must be shown how they can benefit personall y. 29. People should be encouraged to change their mentali ty, e.g. repair or recycle if possible instead of throwing away things. 30. It is not always easy to change human mentality, he nce the principles and values of sustainability must be inculcated at an early age, e.g. at home, in order to help form enlightened and responsible consumers. 31. The principles of sustainability must be incorporat ed into business enterprises by using incentives or legislation throughout the supp ly chain. 32. Development helps to widen peoples' choices, e.g. r ainwater harvesting devices versus big water reservoirs. However, people do not always accept sustainable alternatives easily. One way to encourage acceptanc e would be to involve people fully in the process from the beginning. 33. While appropriate legislation exists, it is not alw ays fully implemented, for instance although an EIA clearly states that the contractor has to replant trees he has cut down for construction of roads, this is not done, and no action is taken by the relevant authorities to ensure compliance. 34. While there are a number of good ideas and good alt ernatives put forward by the public sector, the private sector as well as by ind ividuals, they are not always implemented to completion, e.g. one private company took the initiative to collect specific e-wastes, but was not able to dispose of t he wastes (the container was blocked at the port). 35. One proposal made is to assess the carbon footprint of every activity, for an informed decision to be taken based on the principles of Sus tainable Development. 36. Another proposal is for Government to provide every household with 3 colour coded dustbins, for sorting their rubbish. This would fac ilitate sorting by Municipalities for appropriate disposal/recycling. 37. The issue of e-wastes is assuming alarming proporti ons. In Mauritius, people do not know what to do with their e-wastes, who is respons ible for its disposal or how to dispose of them. 38. Another proposal is for authorities to decide a spe cific day for collection and appropriate disposal of e-wastes. 39. Green education: the next generation must be traine d/ prepared through green education, e.g. training on proper waste disposal, rainwater harvesting, etc. Curricula should be modified to include such topics as part o f the formal syllabus. 40. Incentives need not be only monetary. They can also be in kind. 41. Similarly, there are already a large number of nati onal strategy and action plans that include the principles of sustainable development, e.g. the NAP for SLM, the SCSP, NPDP, Blueprint for Sustainable Diversified Agrifoo d Strategy, etc. These should be used to prepare the MID Green Paper and eventually the MID policy. 42. The Green Paper should be widely publicized/ circul ated before finalising to give all academics a chance to react/comment. 20 43. In the present context of preparing the MID policy, it is not necessary to finish the entire consultation process before taking action; a ction can already be started now even while the consultation process is going on. Some sectors, such as agriculture, tourism, water, culture, could not be considered due to lack of time. However, it is important that they be take n up and discussed among the academic community in order to complete the exercise. VISION University academics want to see Mauritius as a cou ntry where progress in all sectors follows the principles and ethics of Sustai nable Development; where the example is given by the top echelons of administrat ive, economic, societal, political power and trickle down to all layers of society; wh ere regulations/legislation are made through national consultations, and then fully implemented in a fair and just manner; where academics are given their just due an d recognition as forming an important part of the country's intellectual elite and think tank; where strong emphasis is placed on R & D specific to the nationa l interests, and on education, training and public awareness on issues related to Sustainable Development; where all people share the common vision of making Maurit ius a Sustainable Island.

Consultative Meeting with Representatives of the Chilled fish fishery and Banks Operators March 3, 2010 We, the commercial fishing concerns of Mauritius, w ant to see our resources harvested in a manner that will prevent t heir depletion; this would require long-term vision and policy framework s and efficient implementation, a strong emphasis on the importance of the local industry, high level support, streamlined procedur es and good coordination and communication with the relevant and well coordinated authorities for the benefit of the Nati on. Consultative Meeting with Representatives of Fishermen Associations March 1, 2010 We, the fishermen Mauritius, want to live in a coun try where our marine resources are used in a wise manner. Our mar ine environment is used by many different parties. Therefore it is important that their effects on the resource must be controlled and moni tored, so that destruction of resources does not occur at the expe nse of the fishermen (destruction has many sources, including activities in the sea, bad development, and pollution that start on land). Man agement is the shared responsibility of all users, including offic ers and the fishers themselves, and awareness by everyone is important in the pursuit of sustainability. Consultative Meeting with Net Fishermen April 6, 2010 We, the net fishers of the Republic of Mauritius, w ould like to see our marine resources utilized in a sustainable manner, where unethical practices and activities are controlled and prohibi ted. Our marine resources should be efficiently protected and monit ored for the benefit of our nation. Consultative Meeting with Fishermen of Mahebourg & Bambous Virieux, April 9, 2010 We, the fishermen of Mahebourg and Bambous Virieux, would like our marine resources managed in a sustainable way, by m onitoring and controlling destructive and unethical practices. Ou r marine resources should be properly researched upon, while legislati on should create 26 optimum opportunities for the fisher. Consultative Meeting with Fishermen of Grand Bay, Poudre d'Or and Grand Gaube March 3, 2010 We the fishermen of Mauritius will utilise our mari ne resources in a sustainable manner, while being provided with appro priate services. Our marine resources will be restored and managed i n a judicious way for the long term benefit of our nation Consultative Meeting with Fishermen of Trou d'Eau Douce, Poste La Fayette and Grand River South East April 8, 2010 We, the fishermen from Trou d'Eau Douce, Poste La F ayette and Grand River South East would like our marine enviro nment managed in a sustainable way while taking into account the social welfare of the fishermen. Sharing of information pertaining to fis hing should be done in an efficient way. We are prepared to give up net fishing if adequately compensated to preserve the marine resou rces for the future generation. Consultative Meeting with Officers of the Ministry of Agro Industry, Food Production and Security (Fisheries Division) March 1, 2010 We, the people of Mauritius, want to live in a coun try where environmental, social and economic concerns are car efully balanced, and future-present trade-offs are taken into accoun t, where our current and future local resources are carefully managed an d monitored and the effect of global issues are considered and deal t with. Our human resource base is thoroughly aware and capacitated t o help steer our country toward sustainability. Consultative Meeting with the Secondary Education Sector March 26, 2010 We, the stakeholders of the secondary education sec tor, want to live in a safe environment, where innovative methods are de veloped to achieve resource efficiency; where adequate investm ent is made in appropriate infrastructure through visionary town a nd country planning and long term holistic national planning, efficient and eco- friendly public transport system. We want a conducive environment for our schools and encourage saving of resources and promote social cohesiveness . We wish to live in harmony with the global community and leave a le gacy for future generations. Consultative Meeting with Ministry of Education - Cultural centres and other Institutions March 31, 2010 We, the people of the Republic of Mauritius, want t o live in a country where social, economic, political and environmental dimensions (including cultural values and heritage), are caref ully balanced. We recognise the importance of promoting and using our diversity, heritage and culture and wisely. Our human resource should be developed to its fullest potential, regardless of g ender and ethnicity, and across all sectors of society. We should strive to be self-sufficient in our pursuit of social and economic equity, which requires equal opportunities to be made available to our people. W e consider accountability and transparency to be cornerstones for a sustainable 27 Mauritius, which should be our collective aim and r esponsibility. Consultative Meeting with the Local Government & local Authorities April 2, 2010 We, the people of Mauritius, want to live in a coun try that is well- planned, conscious of the limits of its land and re sources, with sufficient green space, pollution-free structures t hat are less reliant on fossil fuels. We recognize that self-sufficiency, o ptimum land-use, good governance and thorough planning and implementation are cornerstones in the collective pursuit of a sustain able Mauritius where all its citizens can be accommodated, now and into the future. Consultative Meeting with Representatives of the Construction Industry April 5, 2010 We want to live in a crime-free Mauritius where the re is a diversity of species and where pristine natural habitats are pre served; where natural and human resources are valued; which is we ll planned, diverse, balanced and managed as a medium sized cit y rather than as a country; self-sustaining in terms of its various consumptions and relying on its local productions; having an improve d waste management system and abreast on all health and saf ety issues. We want to live in a Mauritius which is designed fo r easy mobility in terms of attractive and effective public transport; where people are energy conscious and believe in reduced traffic con gestion leading to improved productivity and a stress-free society; wh ere the civil society is proactive with a common vision and cares to pass on a natural legacy for the next generation. Finally we want to live in a Mauritius where people are ready to become sustainable human beings so that a sustainab le Mauritius can be achieved which can ultimately become an IT city renowned in the world for its multi-cultural living as its strength . Consultative Meeting with Representatives of the Tourism Sector March 19, 2010 We, the people of Mauritius, want to live in a Maur itius which is fair, green, safe and secure, providing equal opportuniti es for all, visionary, spirit of brotherhood, education for all , transparent, good quality of life, wise use of resources, non-corrupt , good governance, strong family values, unity in diversity, careful p lanning, reliable technology, services and infrastructure, self-susta ining, consolidated religious-cultural diversity. Consultative Meeting with Women Associations April 1, 2010 We, the women of Mauritius of Mauritius, want to li ve in a country where our society is secure, our neighbourhoods are safe, our medical and social needs are taken care of, and where we mi nimise our negative impacts on the environment. 28 Consultative Meeting Rodrigues March 26 & 27, 2010 We, the people of the Republic of Mauritius, want t o be a nation in which social, political, environmental and economic dimensions are carefully considered and balanced, where our enviro nment, culture and heritage is respected and used wisely, and our land is carefully planned and managed to achieve optimum benefit for our people. Our human resource should be developed to its fullest p otential in all of our islands, so the necessary creativity, innovatio n and markets can be unlocked that will sustain us into the future. We r ecognize self- sufficiency, recovery of all land and inshore water s, and recognition of our social needs and identity as cornerstones in th e fight against poverty and in the pursuit of a sustainable Republi c of Mauritius, which should be our collective aim and responsibili ty.

Ministry of Public Infrastructure, Land Transport a nd Shipping A reliable & reputable international ship registry - By ratifying and adhering to applicable Internat ional Maritime Conventions, the Division fulfils its mand ate as a Flag state, Port State as well as coastal state. As a Ship Register, it contributes to the Gross Dom estic Product of the Country whilst supporting the sustainable development efforts of the industry thr ough enforcement of relevant International Maritime Conventions. For instance, based on internationally agreed stand ards, vessels registered under the Mauritian Flag a re expected to hold a number of maritime safety, security and e nvironment pollution prevention certificates to be in compliance with prescribed requirements. Safety of life and Property - Substandard vessels are a plague on the maritime industry which put at risk life of crew onboard such vessels and the marine environmen t (in case of the vessel being a tanker for instanc e). As such, regular surveys and inspections conducted by surveyors of the Shipping Division ensure that conv entional size vessels (>24 m in length) engaged in commercia l trade or fishing activities are in seaworthy cond ition. It is also a source of revenue for the Maritime Administr ation; however, the primary objective of this funct ion of the Administration is to ensure safety of life at sea a nd protection of the environment. Preservation of the Marine Environment - Being party to environmental related maritime conve ntions such as MARPOL (International Convention for the prevention of pollution from ships), CLC (international Conve ntion on Civil Liability for Oil pollution damage), FUND (International Convention on the establishment of a n International Fund for Compensation for Oil Polluti on Damage and the OPRC(International Convention on Oil Pollution Preparedness Response and Co-operation), the Division strives to put in place measures to pr event pollution, oil spills and casualties at sea by ensu ring the safe carriage of chemicals and fuel produ cts through strict compliance to applicable regulations.

Ministry of Business, Enterprise and Co-operatives Sustainability issues concerns inter-alia problems of poverty, inequality, hunger and enviro nmental degradation. Co-operatives address these issues qui te well directly or indirectly. In fact, the first co-operative society was registered in 1913 in the sugar-cane se ctor to mitigate these rampant issues. Government recognises the contribution of co-operat ives in the generation of national income, economic democratisation process and strengthening of the fo undation of the present economy. It also views co-o peratives as instruments of social justice whereby a substant ial number of people especially those at the lower strata can improve their position, thus reducing inequalities which may arise from social imbalance. With time, the co-operative movement gathered momen tum and moved from the sugar sector to other sector s of the economy and now includes food crop growers, liv estock breeders, artisans, fishermen and workmen. Today co-operatives are being encouraged to penetra te new fields of activities for enhanced sustainabi lity. New Co-operative Societies being registered are moving from traditional sectors to new sectors such as fin ancial consultancy investment, catering and freeports. In resum\u00e9, the main economic activities in which th e contribution of co-operatives has been significan t are production and marketing of sugar cane, production and marketing of vegetable and fruit, fishing, live stock breeding, bus activities, savings and credit, consu mer stores, handicraft. In the agricultural sector, co-operators are playin g an important role in the production of sugar, veg etable, fruit and flower, milk, meat and fish. Nearly 40% of suga r-cane planters are grouped in co-operatives and th e share of co-operatives in the national sugar production i s around 12%. Co-operative Societies also account f or more than 60% of national production in the food crop se ctor. 75% of onion consumption, 40% of potatoes and about 70% of fresh green vegetables are produced by co-op eratives. The Co-operative Credit Unions (CCUs) are performin g well in providing thrift and savings facilities t o its members. This sector is helping considerably the wo rking class to have access to quick and easy loans. The CCU sector is developing very fast and groups the l argest number of individuals. It comprises some 138 societies with a membership of around 66,000 and di sburses loans nearing Rs 1.3 billion. By being present in those diverse sectors, co-opera tives are helping to alleviate poverty, providing f inance to the needy and curbing shocks from food crisis. Apart from raising the standard of living of Maurit ians, other sustainability issues include: 1. Accessibility to key services: Communities need good access to facilities which c o-operatives strive to service for e.g. access to finance and educational loans. 2. Biodiversity: Co-operatives encourage the cultivation of diverse agricultural products and also encourage use of hydroponics. Grants are often give n for setting up of such businesses. 3. Bribery and corruption: Offering, payment, soliciting or accepting bribes or substantial favours of any form to influence organisational relationships or c ontracts. Our code of Ethics grossly discourages su ch practices. 4. Child labour: Co-operatives and organizations in general discour age use of child labour. 5. Community development: The Ministry with the co-operatives are trying to improve the educational, cultural, economic, social and environmental well b eing of communities. 45 6. Compliance: Meeting the requirements of legislation, standards or any other form of agreement governing sustainability issues. 7.

Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Regional Integration a nd International Trade 1. This Ministry liaises with the United Nations speci alized agencies particularly United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), United Nations Develo pment Programme (UNDP), Secretariat of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Chan ge (UNFCCC), Secretariat of the Ramsar Convention, Secretariat of the Convention on the In ternational, Trade in Endangered Species (CITES), World Health Organization (WHO), Food and Agricultu re Organization (FAO) and makes the necessary coordination to ensure that international Conventio ns and Agreements pertaining to, inter-alia , the protection of the environment, biodiversity, wetlan ds, endangered species and climate change are effectively implemented. 48 2. The Ministry has been active in putting forward the concerns of Mauritius in respect of sustainable development in multilateral fora such as the Common wealth and the Non-Aligned Movement. 3. At the regional level, the Ministry deals with the issue of sustainability within regional organisatio ns such as the SADC, COMESA, IOR-ARC and the IOC. Through t he Ministry, Mauritius engages in several sustainable regional projects. For e.g., At the level of the IOC , the following projects take account of sustainabl e development: Renewable energy Sustainable Agricultural Development and Adaptation to Climate Change Programme on Sustainable Management of Coastal Zone COMESA engages in sustainable development through the fol lowing projects: COMESA Energy Master Plan which caters for the rise in energy demand forecasts through renewable energy Carbon Facility - this will enable project develope rs to access the carbon markets. With regard to the IOR-ARC , the establishment of a Fisheries Support Unit is being discussed. This Unit has the potential to make an important contribution to the conservation of biodiversity, with the anci llary benefits for the protection of fish stocks in the I ndian Ocean Region. 4. The Ministry ensures that Memorandum of Understandin g (MoUs) and Bilateral Agreements entered into with partner countries adhere to the principle of i mproved coherence between trade, environment and social rules. 5. At the national level, the Ministry works in close collaboration with various technical Ministries inc luding the Ministry of Environment & National Development Unit, Ministry of Finance & Economic Empowerment, Ministry of Renewable Energy and Publi c Utilities and the Ministry of Agro-Industry, Food Production and Security to assist them in the implementation of policies and programmes geared towards the economic, social and environmental sust ainability of Mauritius. For example: a) The Ministry has been involved in the preparation o f the National Assessment Report for the five year review of the Mauritius Strategy Implementatio n which was submitted to the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs in Februa ry 2010. b) The Ministry has been working in close collaboratio n with the Ministry of Agro-Industry, Food Production and Security to ascertain sustainable ex ploitation of our Marine resources, through conservation and management measures e.g: limitatio ns on catching gear, protected fish. c) The Ministry in collaboration with the Fisheries Di vision of the Ministry of Agro Industry, Food Production and Security was involved in the adoptio n by the Indian Ocean Commission (IOC) of an Action Plan to fight Illegal, Unregulated and Un reported (IUU) fishing in the region. The adoption of the Action Plan was prompted by the fac t that IUU fishing is a serious threat to sustainability of the fishing and processing sector s in the region. The Action Plan is presently being implemented by the Indian Ocean Commission (I OC) Member States. d) Following the adoption by the Ministry of Renewable Energy and Public Utilities of a Long Term Energy Strategy and Action Plan (2009-2025), which places emphasis on energy efficiency as one of the main strategies to reduce dependency on foss il fuel and to make the economy highly energy efficient, the Ministry is involved in the adoption by Mauritius of a legal framework which could use the EU efficiency standards with respect to air conditioners and refrigerators. Such an approach would enable only importation of appliance s satisfying the EU efficiency norms, which is one of the most stringent into the country. e) The Ministry also follows ACP-EU issues with other technical Ministries. One of the main facets of the partnership between the ACP and the EU is su stainable development of Member States. To this effect, a substantial amount of the funds avai lable under that Partnership (10 th EDF) is devoted to programmes that have the element of sust ainability, such as the ACP-EU Energy Facility, the ACP-EU Water Facility and the ACP-EU Natural Disaster Facility. 49 f) The Ministry was represented in a Workshop on 18 Ma rch 2010 held at the Ministry of Environment & NDU to discuss a project funded by th e Government of Japan (around US $ 3 m). The project aims at supporting integrated and compr ehensive approaches to climate change adaptation in Mauritius. g) In October 2008, the Ministry also acted as a facil itator for the signing of an Aide Memoire pertaining to the implementation of sustainable dev elopment projects between the Government of Mauritius and the UNESCO. 6. The work of the Ministry also relates to sustainabi lity in the sense that the development of trade pol icies are geared towards economic development of the coun try, sustained economic growth and improving social welfare of the citizens. Since trade and env ironment protection are intricately inter-linked, i t is important to ensure that policies formulated to saf eguard the economic interests of Mauritius are in harmony with environmental preservation.

Each document was processed by the Technical Support Uni t team, firstly categorising all issues raised into 4 sectors, i.e. Economy, Environment, S ocial and Stewardship of Government. Issues in each sector were then classified into the mes and then sub-themes. The issues were coded to show the sector, theme and sub-theme in wh ich they were categorised in. A refinement of codes used for the list of issues was carried out after some 50 documents had been analysed, taking into consideration the nature of inputs and the views / perceptions of the different members of the team carrying out the analysis. The final classification, which includes 36 themes, 81 subthemes and 117 issues (id entified by an individual code), aim at facilitating data processing. These can be regroupe d and used for further analysis by researchers and policy makers. The summary of the a nalysis, available in the TSU report 2010, lists each issue, sub-theme, theme and sector as well as the scores per sector, theme and issue, calculated from the number of times an issue was raised in all the 362 documents analysed.

A huge amount of input was gained, that can be analysed to various depths in o rder to address particular concerns 3. For the purpose of the Green Paper, which has the r ole of informing subsequent stages in the process, the results are presented only in b road strokes after an initial analysis 4. The question arises whether the views expressed so far are representative of the nation, and whether there was enough consultation. The two questions are not the same. In the first few meetings all issues listed w ere of course new. As meetings progressed new issues naturally became fewer and fe wer. Eventually hardly any new ones were raised, indicating that input was becomin g exhausted. What thoughts may have been left out can easily be caught by publishi ng the Green Paper and inviting further comment. On the other hand, the promise was made at the laun ch of the consultative forum, and re-iterated frequently after that, that every Mauri tian who wish to give input should have the opportunity to do so. This was not the cas e on Rodrigues, where village presidents and other leaders indicated a strong int erest in having ground level consultations. On the main island of Mauritius ther e were further groups and pockets of society that were not consulted. After an initial reluctance of those in charge to a llow open public meetings, the permission finally came, but it was too late as by then elections were approaching fast. Considering the importance of the landmark po licy process, it is therefore recommended that more consultations be conducted to improve the results of the Green Paper. If nothing else, this would raise a de eper awareness and ensure 2Their appreciation was expressed often to the Gener al Facilitator, who allayed the fears of some that their input would go nowhere. They deserve to see the collectiv e results published, as an interim result of the po licy process - for instance through the publication of a popular version of the Green Paper. 3 For this purpose, the complete raw information set s are kept and managed by the Ministry of Environme nt and Sustainable Development (MoESD). 4 It is very important to note that visioning worksh ops solicited input from people but did not allow s ufficient discussion; therefore, although there was consensus on major issues, everyone may not necessarily have converged on consensus on every point. Many useful and specific points were also raised that would be worthy of discussion in thematic workshops. 57 pervasive buy-in across society, all of which will make implementation of the policy easier. It was also always anticipated that after the Green Paper, there would be more intensive workshops and working groups to further c larify and discuss input. This would provide further opportunities for input. Whil e consultative meetings should not be confused with working groups, where issues will be addressed in a more targeted way, more issues may be expected to surface in work shops with groups such as the Joint Economic Council (JEC) and Women in Networkin g (WIN), to name but a few. While theme-based working groups are a given, secto ral workshops should also be considered 5. 8.2 Overall trends Overall trends are presented in the main Green Pap er report. 8.3 Confounding factors Although their overall effect may be negligible, se veral confounding factors ought to be pointed out, as well as points on why they are not considered serious and how confounding effects may be lessened: 1. Most visioning workshops were organised along the l ines of Special Interest Groups. Although at the start of each meeting it was stress ed that input is given not as a fisherman, for instance, but as a Mauritian. It may be expected that the interest of those in the groups may cause a certain bias toward the way people make their living, their gender (such as women's associations, where p articipants were asked to not focus on women's issues only), their academic pursu its (such as in the case of academics where again, participants were asked to c ontribute as citizens and not as academics). The number of meetings with the same SI G (for instance there were several meetings with fishers who included small-sc ale local fishers and then also large commercial companies) may have an influence o n the charts. A weighted analysis taking into account the number of meetings per SIG and the number of participants per meeting may be used for a more obj ective conclusion. 2. Although 117 issues have been identified in the tab le in Annex 7, some important ones may have been diluted into related subthemes a nd are not as apparent. For 5 For instance, the fisherman associations, the line fishing associations, semi-industrial and bank fish ing operators, etc. have all shown that they, and not o nly the scientists possess a great deal of informat ion and an invaluable perspectives that may be used in the pur suit of a more sustainable fishing industry. The sa me may be expected of other sectors as well. 58 example, there is no issue labelled as \"reduction o f use of fossil fuels\" but different related ones such as romote eco-friendly be anal ysed using slightly different sub- themes. However, as analysis was done by a group of people and not just one individual, and groupings were debated beforehand, confounding effects are unlikely to be serious. 3. As far as inputs received in free format are concer ned (emails, letters), some people elaborate more than others. For example, in some ca se it is mentioned \" we should solve the problem of waste \" without details or repetition, a score of 1 would be attributed. In case of further details, or repetiti on, a higher score would be attributed to this same issue / sub-theme. 4. Individual submissions (e.g. emails, questionnaires ) are given the same consideration / weight as collective ones (SIG, NGOs). In practic e, the whole group agrees on the Vision and not necessarily on each issue. 5. The above confounding factors are not considered se rious at the Green Paper stage, which serves mostly to flag issues and provide a fo undation for further consultation, as well as working groups were particular issues fl agged may be addressed more systematically. 6. The General Facilitator strongly suggested public m eetings at the village, municipal and district levels, as well as open public meeting s, and meetings with village councils and municipal councils. Confounding effect s will be easily overcome by having meetings at different organisation levels in society. 7. Most importantly, the purpose of meetings was to gi ve Mauritians a chance to speak out on issues that they consider important in the pursuit of a Sustainable Mauritius. The consultations were therefore not \"voting\" on sp ecific issues, or trying to balance solutions that may be incompatible - thi s would happen at a decision making level when options will be discussed, where long term and short term benefits can be offset, and non-renewable vs renewable options may be debated and transitions from the former to the latter may be planned accord ingly. What was very important was to ensure that as many issues as possible were flagged, and in spite of confounding factors, their relative importance to M auritians is interesting in itself. 8. Far more serious would be pre-emptive designs of working groups, ba sed on the advice of consultant(s), as this may have a direct effect on how policy issues are prioritised or even what may be in the policy. 59 8.4 Results by Special Interest Groups Rather than only considering all input clumped toge ther, data was also considered at the SIG group level. Results possibly may inform the design of future consultations, including working groups, or may even point to other importan t aspects of policy formulation. The Fisheries Special Interest Group Figure 1: Views of the fishers sector on issues per taining to sustainability The stakeholders from the fishery sector were conce rned about laws and regulations pertaining to fishery and marine resources, which a ccounted for (24%) of input. It was felt that the laws and regulations either needed to be e nforced, or reviewed. One of the key issues identified by the stakeholders was the conflict bet ween tourism activities and fishers (18%). It 60 was discussed that these conflicts needed to be add ressed through strategic ways in order to attain sustainable development. Two very important points surfaced that have an imp lication on policy formulation: 1. The legal machinery was considered a key player in this sector, and legal review or deficiencies in enforcement are flagged as obstacle s to sustainable development - rather than simply listing issues and priorities su ch as when all data were clumped; 2. Conflict between two important economic sectors her e, namely between tourism and fishing, and this has several implications for poli cy. First, a balance may need to be found between sectors when it comes to the use of t he marine environment, or second, mechanisms need to be developed and/or measures be built into the policy to mitigate or adjudicate over sectoral conflicts, and third, t he policy may require the development of integrated government or at the very least coordinating mechanisms between sectors. The Education Special Interest Group The education SIG indicated that solid waste manage ment (36%), waste recycling (18%) clean energy and transport 6 (14%), were top priorities in developing a sustain able Mauritius (see Figure 2). Figure 2: Views from the Education SIG on issues pe rtaining to sustainability 6Clean energy and transport refers to hybrid cars, s olar cars, use of renewable energy for boats, etc. 61 Clearly, a wide range of topics came up during the meeting, showing again that the SIG approach works very well. SIG interests can be refi ned in working groups where interactions will target specific sectors more closely. The Academic and Students Special Interest Group The academic and students SIG mainly comprised of t he Mauritians who are learners at UTM, MGI and other academic institutes. Again the i ssue of solid waste management was a top priority (17%), followed by clean energy and tr ansport (13%) and awareness and research and development at 11%. Figure 3: Views from the Academic and Students SIG on issues pertaining to sustainability The Health Special Interest Group The Health SIG group expressed social issues (29%) such as, social welfare, access to adequate health facilities, alcohol and drug abuse and solid waste management (14%) as major concerns in Mauritius (see Figure 4). Clean e nergy and transport was the third major issue. Discussions revealed many links between heal th, lifestyle and environment. What will be important in a legal review is to determine how such factors are taken care of in the existing legislation. 62 Figure 4: Views from the Health SIG on issues perta ining to sustainability Women Special Interest Group Solid waste management (14%) was also a major conce rn to the women's SIG group, see Figure 5 below. 63 Figure 5: Views from the Women's SIG on issues pert aining to sustainable development The Information and Communication Technology SIG The Information and Communication Technology SIG we re mainly concerned about Energy Efficiency and the management and disposal of elect ronic waste, with 28% and 21%, respectively, of the respondents sighting this issu e. 64 Figure 6: Views from the ICT SIG on issues pertaini ng to sustainability The Environment Special Interest Group The Environmental SIG composing of Ministry of Envi ronment's stakeholders indicated that there was a need to raise awareness with regard to clean energy and transport (22%), water recycling (17%) and waste management issues (13%). 65 Figure 7: Views from the Environmental SIG on issue s pertaining to sustainability The Local Authorities Special Interest Group About 19 % of the issues raised by the participants from the local and district council were directed towards the need for green spaces around t he island. The need for controlling pollution came out with equal weight as the need fo r green spaces, while the need for laws and enforcement (13%) was rated also as one of the top priorities for sustainable development. Figure 8: Views from the local authorities 66 The Construction Industry SIG The SIG group from the construction industry sector were concerned about laws and enforcement, taking up 30% weight of the raised iss ues, while green building or eco building came out as the second (20%) key issue in the pursu it towards sustainable development in the of Mauritius. Figure 9: Views from the construction industry SIG The Land Transport and Shipping SIG The land transport and shipping sector had green bu ilding as a priority (29%), followed by law enforcement (19%) and efficient transport (14%) . 67 Figure 10: Views from the Land Transport and Shipping SIG The Social Security Special Interest Group The social security SIG indicated that social issue s (15%), energy efficiency (15%), awareness (13%), clean energy and transportation (1 3%) and waste management (10%) were key issues that needed to be addressed in order for Mauritius to achieve sustainable development. 68 Figure 11: Views from the social security SIG The NGOs Special Interest Group The NGO SIG represented by MACOSS indicated that so cial issues (37%) were of major concern to the general population of Mauritius as w ell as the need to adopt the Reduce, Reuse and Recycle concept (10%). 69 Figure 12: Views from the NGOs SIG (MACOSS) The Tourism Special Interest Group The stakeholders in the tourism sector indicated th at the need for clean energy and transportation (17%), laws and regulations (12%) an d energy efficiency (10%), were some of the key issues that needed to be addressed for sust ainable development. It is significant that only 3% were concerned with the impacts of tourism, which are known to be vast in the environmental as well as social dimensions. This in dicates a strong need for education of players in the sector - including introducing them to Responsible Tourism Guidelines. Such actions can be incorporated in the Action Plan. 70 Figure 13: Views from the Tourism SIG Views of the Inhabitants of Rodrigues In Rodrigues, people were relatively more concerned about biodiversity conservation (16%), awareness (12%) and high unemployment (12%) rate. 71 Figure 14: Views of the inhabitants of Rodrigues on issues pertaining to sustainability The Trade Unions SIG The trade unions thought the waste management (16%) , laws and regulations (11%), clean energy and transport (11%) are key issues that need to be addressed for Mauritius to be on a sustainable trajectory. Figure 15 gives a summary o f what the issues were in broad categories however there are issues such as the democratisatio n of the economy that should be equal to redistribution of land for agriculture purposes wit h the view to achieve food self-sufficiency and the need for participatory input throughout the whole Policy Process that cannot be properly summarised though viewed highly by this se ctor. 72 Figure 15: Views from the Trade Unions SIG 73 Annex 9: Compilation of Ministerial input 9.1 List of all Legislations, Policies and Strategies The list of legislations below is from the question naires submitted; this is not a comprehensive list and does not include all the leg islations under each Ministry.

Ministry of Women`s Rights, Child Development and F amily Welfare Sustainability Issues Explanation Regeneration and Rebuilding communities Poverty and social marginalisation of people in dep rived areas should be addressed with the creation of jobs, fight crime, i mprove health conditions, provide better and more affordable housing and civi c education of the mass. Flexible Working (Work/Life balance) Sexual education for Any pattern of working which is different from a st andard, traditional nine to four, work on an employer's premises. The huge vari ety of options work; and many other possibilities. 79 awareness raising in children & adolescents Organis ations should ensure that work schedules are reasonable, s uch that workers are not required to work in excess of the r equired hours a week. Work-life balance ensures that everyone, regardless of age, race or gender or other needs can combine work with their other respo nsibilities or aspirations. Sustainable organisations are open to adjusting wor king patterns and providing flexibility in employment practices. This can help to increase productivity, attract the skilled, experienced and motivated staff needed and to retain them in a competitive market place. The forthcoming Parental Empowerment Programme of t he Ministry aims at guiding parents and members of the community on how to address the issue of sexual education of children. Carrying out Civic education Regulating the Informal sector -Mediation Services/ Family Court Civic education on numerous issues such as the spir it of good neighbourhood, street dumping, amongst others would reap benefits in the long term. Clear and official regulations would keep exploitat ion of cheap labour in check. Structures and services must be made child friendly and more responsive to the needs of children. In this context, the court proc edures need to be reviewed to ensure that court procedures are not lengthy and mo re detrimental to children. Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Regional Integration a nd International Trade Foreign Policy in the same line as other policies f ormulated by Government should be situated in the c ontext of sustainable development. Currently, coordination ta kes place on an adhoc basis between different Ministries which may be working on sustainable development ini tiatives. There is need, therefore, to establish a more permanent form of coordination mechanism to look at sustainable development in a comprehensive and hol istic manner, and where relevant issues can be addressed. Some of these issues are: 1. More initiatives to be taken on the basis of the Ma uritius Strategy for Small Island Developing States (SIDS). 2. More Involvement in the decision-making process at international level in line with sustainability objectives. 3. Assessment of the impact of our decisions on sustai nability. Caution : Sustainable development and/or environmental prot ection should not be a pretext for furthering other hidden agendas (e.g.: Marine Prote ction Area in the Chagos Archipelago) Ministry of Finance and Economic Empowerment No response Attorney General's Office It is up to the Ministries to identify the new issu es and only then our office may help in the reviewi ng of the existing legislations (e.g. on food safety) and dra fting of new laws. Ministry of Youth and Sports 1. Use of recycled paper 2. Waste segregation 3. Sustainable production and consumption Ministry of Local Government, Rodrigues and Outer I slands, local government 1.

Agro Industry, Food Production & Security 1. Lack of Manpower 2. Financial Resources 3. Specialised skills 4. Land tenure - all the State Forest Lands are not ve sted to the Forestry Service 5. Privately owned forest lands are not under the cont rol of the Forestry Service 6. Green technology out of reach for the common man. 7. Sustainable agriculture is costly and thus generall y are not the preferred means of production Ministry for Consumer Protection and Citizens Chart er 1. Lean human resource capacity and inadequate financi al resources 2. Legislations need to be reviewed 3. (Laws Reforms Commission has just submitted a Compr ehensive Report to that effect). Ministry of Education, Culture & Human Resources 1. Non-alignment of the vision of different stakeholde rs because of their several special and personal interests that conflict with those of the Ministry. 2. Absence of an integrated policy per se for sustaina bility in view of the restrictive perception of the term that has traditionally been associated with environ mental concerns exclusively. 3. Difficulty to change mindset out of sheer conservat ism 4. Lack of research culture. 5. Lack of information and sensitization campaigns (ou treach programs) 6. Lack of capacity and expertise in some areas (illus tratively, the absence of a protocol for the dispos al of hazardous chemicals). 7. Absence of an institutional monitoring mechanism. 8. Little collective participation in decision making process and hence little ownership of the issues. Ministry of Health and Quality of Life 1. Absence of proper policies/strategies with regard t o health and sustainable development; 2. Lack of resources, both human and financial (Exampl e: Training man power in specific areas); 3. Not a donor favourable country in view that Mauriti us is classified as an upper middle income country. Ministry of Housing and Lands Institutional, legislative and technical gaps, incl uding: 1. Outdated law (the TCP Act dates back to 1954). It c an no longer respond effectively to the needs of th e fast-growing Mauritius economy.

For each issue raised, the Ministry mandate that best addressed the issue was determined and the issues placed under that Ministry. Most Ministerial mandates were obtained via the que stionnaires sent to the Ministries. The Ministry of Fisheries & Rodrigues and the Ministry of Renewable Energy & Public Utilities mandates were taken from the official Government we bsite, www.gov.mu . Most of the issues raised by the general public cou ld be linked easily to the mandate of one Ministry, and in some cases to more than one. Issues that could not be readily linked to a Minist ry were clumped in one category at the end, and are presented in brick red and bold font. In te rms of governance, Mauritians stated that they want Government to lead by example, fight agai nst corruption, ensure dialogue with civil society (Unions, NGOs etc), promote good gove rnance, and that better overall planning occurs. There should be efficiency in planning and the Government should provide funds, formulate legislations and determine actions to pro mote the implementation of MID. People wished that Government could initiate more actions to move the country towards sustainability. Emphasis in the MID should be on th e drawing up of an action plan which will drive the country towards sustainable development. In addition, it is important to make it clear at this stage (in the policy formulation proc ess) on what is sustainable and what is not. The issue of governance such as channelling of fund s (CSR funds), support of institutes such as the local government were pertinent to sustainab le governance for the Mauritians (see Table below). Some of these issues in red could in fact possibly be linked to certain Ministries, such as the fight against corruption may be linked to the Attor ney General's Office. However, we the above issues were considered as 'hanging' between M inistries and not taken care of, and are therefore reported as such. The analysis of mandates and other institutional ma tters is only preliminary: the intention was that an institutional mandate expert be engaged to further analyse data and conduct in-depth and interactive research with Ministries. Unfortunately the expert was not engaged in Phase 1 as originally planned and now will be engaged in Phase 2. 90 Ministry Ministry Mandates Issues raised by the General Public Ministry of Foreign Affairs Vision and Objectives: 1.

It was always understood, and stated in public meetings that the LED methodology applied at a village level in Le Morne would be exploratory in terms of how consultation for MID may occur at a local level. Government could then decide if the methodol ogy could be applied at a local level and at a late r stage during consultations for MID. It contains short exe rts from the LED Plan for Le Morne village, that sh ows the Vision that developed, the Executive Summary that p rovides the context, and the methodology. At a firs t glance it can be seen that the LED methodology is a variat ion of the methodology used in the national consult ations, though it has a finer resolution. However, it is tr ied and tested for application in the Mauritian loc al community context and can easily be adapted for local communi ty consultation for the National Policy for a Susta inable Mauritius. At the end of the methodology is a list of social welfare centres, villages and constituenc ies where the approach can be deployed. Like in the case of Le Mo rne, local CBOs can be trained to do the consultati on. Vision Vision for Le Morne village The Vision for Le Morne village was developed durin g the course of three public meetings and a series of workshops with community-based associations. It pre sents the collective view of the inhabitants of the village, as to where they see their village and themselves o ne day. In this sense the Vision functions as a gui ding light on the road into the future, with the Local Economic D evelopment Plan serving as the road map: \"We envision Le Morne to be a safe place to live, w here there are adequate facilities and infrastructure. Our natural resources, both on land and in the sea, and our cultural environment should be respected, kept clean and dev eloped in a wise manner so the local population can benefit, and tourists will be attrac ted to our village. Our human resource should be developed through capacity building oppor tunities and access to equal education, leading to flourishing business opportun ities. Development in Le Morne should always be mindful of our heritage values and way of life that makes our village so special\". 100 11.1 Executive summary In February 2010, the Le Morne Heritage Trust Fund commissioned a Local Economic Development (LED) Plan for Le Morne Cultural Landscape. The LED Plan is considered a major instrument that will help to guide development that will lead to an improved quality o f life in the village of Le Morne, and the surround ing area through improved infrastructure and services, and t he creation of sustainable business opportunities a nd employment. The purpose of LED is to build up the economic cap acity of a local area in such a way that its economic future can be improved, with a positiv e impact on the quality of life for all inhabitants . It is a process by which public, business and non-governmen tal sector partners work collectively to create bet ter conditions for economic growth and employment gener ation. The local community is at the centre stage of the L ED planning process. The LED Plan for the Le Morne Cultural Landscape was developed as a result of ext ensive engagement with the local inhabitants as wel l as consultation with relevant authorities and other pl ayers. Community involvement came by way of public meetings and visioning exercises with Community-Bas ed Associations (CBAs). To further ensure that loca l interests were safeguarded, and to instil a sense o f ownership by the community, an LED Planning Commi ttee was selected at the village level, to spearhead the process, and be closely involved in the elaboratio n of the plan. Most importantly, the LED Plan pursues a collective ly constructed Vision and can be considered a road map to this end. There are four sections to the LED Plan. The first section provides an Introduction with essential background, the purpose of the plan and a basic description of the area covered by the plan. Section 2 explains th e Methodology in a fair amount of detail, and the third section p resents the Outcomes of the consultative process, socio-economic research and desk work on other init iatives that may impact on local economic developme nt. The fourth section provides a combined Strategy and Implementation Plan that is short, direct and suitable for local consumption, as agreed with the community and Le Morne Heritage Trust Fund (LMHTF). It also cont ains an indicative budget for the short- and longer term with indications of who the drivers of the differe nt components could be. The Le Morne community is well aware of the pivotal place that they occupy in the Le Morne Cultural Landscape (LMCL) and the important role that they h ave to play in the maintenance and development of t he World Heritage Site. They hold their heritage dear, they care very much about their village and the wa y of life in it, and there is a strong sense of belonging to the community. They are also eager to collaborate with Government and other partners in developing the LMC L and making their village a better place to live. They are intensely aware of environmental problems, both on land and in the lagoon. They participated actively in the development of the LED Plan, and the Village Counci l (well represented on the Planning Committee) and other tiers of Government have been most cooperative in t he collective planning exercise. 101 According to the World Bank \"the purpose of local e conomic development (LED) is to build up the economic capac ity of a local area to improve its economic future and the q uality of life for all. It is a process by which public, busi ness and non- governmental sector partners work collectively to c reate better conditions for economic growth and employmen t generation\". Twenty four major issues and/or areas of concern o r interest were identified through the consultative process and supportive research; the sewerage system, publi c health, child care facilities, training and capac ity building, education, the need for a multi-purpose centre, spo rts facilities, ecotourism development, creating an d enabling environment for businesses, food security, safety, environmental custodianship, arts and culture, land accessibility and ownership, marine resources and l agoon management, and quality of life. These points are targeted by ten areas of intervention, which are li sted by issue and area of intervention in the Strat egy and Implementation Plan. Some areas of intervention cov er more than one issue, and some issues cut across several areas of intervention. The main areas of intervention first and foremost i nclude access to the Mountain . A Multi-Purpose Resource Centre (MPRC) has been identified as an effective way to address many issues concerning social health, human development and capacity building. Access to land is a major cross-cutting issue, and this is couple d with better use of land that is currently available for development. The creation of an enabling environment for business will give small business development a great boost. Assistance to the fishing community is very important, considering that Le Morne is primarily a fishing co mmunity where almost everyone has some connection t o the sea. Education, sport and social services require diverse improvements. Tourism development can contribute greatly to the overall development of the LMCL, and has to proceed along Sustainable Tourism and Respo nsible Tourism guidelines. Unlocking assistance from the p rivate sector is also a priority, as is the provisi on of essential infrastructures . Finally, considering the World Heritage Site sta tus of the LMCL, heritage development is deemed essential and urgent. The LED Plan is a vehicle to guide both local and n ational Government when designing projects around L MCL. It can also inform donor funding and private sector involvement and most importantly, the LED Plan can help to coordinate the multi-sector efforts at making the L MCL a better place to live while safeguarding the e ssential characteristics, namely the Outstanding Universal Value , the Authenticity and the Integrity of the site, that led to it being inscribed on the World Heritage Lis t. Above all, the LED Plan also reminds the inhabit ants and different interest groups in Le Morne of what they strive towards collectively, as a local community w ho has a key role to play in the unfolding of the plan which , after all, is theirs. The LED Plan crystallizes t he ground level agenda and, at a country level has the potential to become a remarkable example of a 'top down, bottom up' approach to local economic development. The LED Plan aims to foster and maintain a higher q uality of life in Le Morne village, and the surroun ding area by unlocking local economic development opportuniti es; a good LED Plan typically may call for improved infrastructure and services, the creation of sustainable business opportunities based on the strengths and potential of the areas, and employment that is related to opportunities that may exist or could possibly be developed. A well-defined 102 Sustainable development is development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. It is generally accepted that a balance between Economic, Environmental and Social dimensions have to be achieved in the pursuit of sustainability. UNESCO adds a fourth pillar, namely Culture. LED Plan that addresses short as well as long-term development opportunities will help to secure and s teer sustainable development at the local level - in a w ay that will also benefit the country at large (suc h as promoting diversification of the tourism industry). Priorities identified in the LED Plan can also pro vide guidance in terms of Corporate Social Responsibilit y contributions (CSR), and Government infrastructur e and social spending. The LED Plan may also inform certa in private sector initiatives. A good LED Plan can also assist in unlocking donor-funded interventions. Wit hout a LED Plan, development at the local level run s the risk of ending up consisting mostly of a d hoc interventions. Making an LED Plan requires a collective Vision formulated by the local communities. The Vision defines a point somewhere in the future to which th e community aspires to. The Vision is the guiding lig ht for the development of strategies that are rooted i n a situational analysis of the economic potential that exists locally. Ground level realities and the specificities of the area have to be taken into acc ount to ensure that plans and expectations are realistic. T he LED Plan harnesses the input from the local comm unity, Government, regional authorities, and other role pl ayers into a set of strategies and guidelines aimed at creating a suitable climate for economic growth. The LED Plan also identifies 'quick wins' to help a lleviate poverty in the short-term. The current LED Plan embraces local values, and strikes a clear balance between socio-cultural, environmental and economic issues of the Le Morne Cultural Landscape. 11.2 Methodology 11.2.1 The process The Cultural Landscape Management Plan of 2008 advo cates for sustainable management of the area, and c alls for a formal LED Plan to be developed for Le Morne. At a Le Morne Heritage Trust Fund (LMHTF) Board mee ting on the 25th of February 2010, it was agreed th at the development of an LED has become imperative, an d requested EcoAfrica Environmental Consultants (Gauteng) Pty Ltd to facilitate and coordinate the process of developing an Economic Development Plan for Le Morne Cultural Landscape. This section outlines adaptive methods and approach es used during the project duration. Figure 16 shows the methodology adapted for develop ment of an LED plan for LMCL in the form of a flowchart 103 Figure 16: Flowchart showing the LED planning proce ss Each box illustrates respective points where public meetings are held, input from stakeholder groups a re solicited and fed into the process, when the Vision is formulated, when the plan is elaborated and app roved, as well as the establishment of the Planning Committee and Steering Committee for implementation of the P lan. The LED planning process for Le Morne required a mu lti-sectoral engagement as shown in Figure 16. Cent ral to the development of any LED Plan is consultation wit h the local community. This was done in several way s. The spine of the LED planning process started with two public meetings (see blue boxes in Figure 16). In t he first meeting the LED planning process was discussed and agreed upon by the community. Strengths and weaknes ses were listed, and the basic components of a prelimin ary Vision where defined, specifying where the comm unity wants to be heading. During the first meeting the c ommunity also requested that intensive consultation be held with groups in the villages and stakeholder groups were subsequently identified by the community (see list on the left side of Figure 16) and consulted. During t he second meeting more strengths and weaknesses, as well as opportunities and obstacles to local development we re discussed in a participative manner, and a draft Vision was constructed. A Planning Committee was also sele cted that would work with the consultants in refini ng the plan. Then a collaborative process of drafting the plan ensued, in which the team interacted with a Pl anning Committee on a number of occasions. As the need for information became increasingly apparent, research was 104 undertaken in collaboration with the LED Planning C ommittee and selected community members. This involvement of villagers ensured that capacity is t ransferred along the way, and the process remained transparent. The LED Plan was then presented to the community in broad strokes during a third public m eeting (see third blue box in Figure 16) where the Vision was ratified. During this meeting it was also decid ed that the Plan would be made available in Creole for further discussion, and input could be lodged at the LMHTF site office. Once finalized, the Plan would be ready for implementation, with regular reporting to a Steeri ng Committee. 11.2.2 Planning The consultants met with the Le Morne Heritage Trust Fund Board as well as individual members, the LMHTF site office team and a local NGO (SEED) in February 2010. Similarly a public meeting in Le Morne was held during the same month to gauge the willingness of the community and stakeholders to engage in a LED process, and to gain preliminary input on weakness and opportunities. Consultation and engagement with the mentioned parties was crucial prior to the commencement of the LED planning process. Furthermore, these engagements we re imperative for all parties to acquire a mutual understanding of the process, as well as the propos ed methodology and what the LED Plan will aim to do . 11.2.3 Local stakeholder consultation i. Under the aegis of Le Morne Heritage Trust Fund, a meeting with the fishers of Le Morne and La Gaulette 7 was held in February 2010, with partial support fr om the Agulhas and Somali Currents Large Marine Ecosystem (ASCLME) Project 8 and the Department of Fisheries, with approval fro m the LMHTF. The aim of the meeting was to identify issue s that affect the fishers and their livelihoods, an d the community in general. The opportunity was also used to discuss the MID concept and acquire input into the National Policy for a Sustainable Mauritiu s. A lagoon management committee was elected to collectively draw up a lagoon management plan. The lagoon management plan was deemed critical for the livelihood of the fishers. ii. With full support, and under the aegis of LMHTF, th e team held a second meeting in Le Morne during February 2010. The meeting provided an opportunity for community members to provide input into the process itself, and to interactively discuss the we akness and opportunities, and also air their needs and aspirations. This exercise was not only critical t o sensitise the community on the LED process, but a lso 7 This meeting, and subsequent meetings with fishers were treated the same as consultations with commun ity- based associations as the fishers are a special int erest group in the community. 8 http://www.dlist-asclme.org/ Plate 5: Public meeting held on the 20 th of February 2010, in the Le Morne village hall 105 to cultivate a sense of ownership for the plan - id eally the LED plan should be driven by community needs. iii. At the end of the public meeting mentioned in ii, a Planning Committee was selected through nomination (some through self nomination and subseq uent endorsement in the public meeting). The committee consists of representatives from the vill age, Village Council and NGOs. Three of these members are also in the Village Council: Mr. Anil K umar Lollbeeharry, Shayestee Bhungawoo (Ms Shayestee Bhungawoo was not present on the day the photograph was taken, Plate 6). iv. During these meetings, the community members raised their weaknesses, opportunities and needs in Le Morne Cultural Landscape. A third public meeting wa s held in June where the findings of the LED planning process were presented to the audience. A Draft Vision that had been developed from input of the first public meeting, and subsequent consultati ons with the Community-Based Associations, was presented during the third meeting and modified bas ed on input from the participants; thereafter the Draft Vision was modified and approved as the final version.

Back row from left to right: Mr. Patrick Norton, Mr. Lallshing Shamah, Ms. Mrs. Fabien Auguste and Mrs. Joanna Louis; Front row from nce 106 11.2.4 Visioning exercises with community-based associatio ns i. During the visioning phase, group-based consultativ e workshops with identified Community-based Associations (CBAs) were undertaken 9, and six CBAs were consulted namely; senior citize n association, women association, Le Morne Village Co uncil, PTA, youth associations, and NGOs. The aim of the consultation exercise was to (i) gather input from the associations (weakness and opportunities that exist in LMCL), and to (ii) cons truct a vision that was approved by the group. The vision for each group of CBAs was derived from the issues identified by them. The respective visions were eventually merged into the overall Draft Visio n for the LMCL. At the third public meeting, the findings of the LED planning process were presented to the audience. A Draft Vision was presented to the community; thereafter the Draft Vision was modi fied and approved to the Vision presented in this LED Plan. 11.2.5 Consultation with the other relevant stakeholders i. Ad hoc meetings and consultations were done with re levant stakeholders to gain an overall understanding of economic situation in Le Morne. Th e team consulted with the Ministry of Environment and National Development Unit 10 , Ministry of Tourism, Leisure and External Communications, Ministry of Housing and Lands, and relevant institutions such as the Black River District Council. Consultations were held in order to identify policies and laws, and to source proper guidance on how the LED plan can be integrated into other development plans earmarked for the region. ii. Dedicated meetings with District Council and local authorities were paramount to the development of the LED plan. Engaging with local and district auth orities will create a platform for identification o f further development needs within the LMCL . Local economic development after all is a continuin g process. The team also carried out consultation with develop ers (e.g. Indian Resort, Paradis and Dina Robin), promoters, and donor agencies to leverage funding t owards the needs and projects identified by the communities. Consultations were done through face t o face interviews though in some cases like hotels written interviews were prefered. [End of excerpts from the Le Morne LED Plan] 9 These ground level consultation were conducted by team members from SEED after some training and with the collaboration of Le Morne site office staff. In addition EcoAfrica facilitated two meetings with t he fishers of Le Morne and La Gaulette with ASCLME project fundin g. 10 Now the Ministry of Environment and Sustainable De velopment. 107 11.2.6 Constituency Name Const.

In many instances, there is a heavy emphasis on Economy. Input from the national consultations showed that instead of balan cing just the 3 Es, the reality is that there are other issues that need to be looked into as wel l in order for Mauritius to be placed on a sustainable trajectory. From the input given by all the stakeholders, inclu ding Government, civil society, NGOs and other institutions, eight Es were identified. These were structured based on the already identified 5 axes of Es that emanated from the High Level Workshop of December 2010, namely Energy, Environment, Employment, Education a nd Equity. From the input given by the different sectors, it a ppeared that three more E's could easily be added. These additional Es are Economy, Ecology (ar ising from splitting the 'brown' and 'green' issues that are currently clumped under one E) and Evaluation (which is closely aligned with governance issues; see further explana tion in the Green Paper). Key Issues that need to be addressed can be roughly summarised under each E below: The 5 E-s Sub-themes Issues raised by the General Public Issues not adequately addressed by Ministries Energy Manage Energy Demand and Adapt to Climate Change Energy Promote / provide incentives for energy efficiency e.g. control A/Cs Invest in solar (PV, water heaters), wind, wave, etc. Promote / provide incentives Promote / provide incentives for use of renewable energy Use of renewable resources where possible Boats/Vessels Early warning system pertaining to cyclone/climate/tsunami/ food production Legal framework is inadequate Registry management system is not in place Designing of policies to enforce relevant provisions of conventions Marketing initiatives Capacity building Shipping Development Forum Port Reception Facilities Transport Reduce traffic congestion Co-voiturage / better & subsidised public transport Light rail transport system Promote cycling / walking Transport facilities for Public Officers Integrating traffic / road safety aspects in all land planning issues 111 Promote eco-friendly transport / ethanol, electric vehicles Urbanisation Land Use Planning Ensure good land planning /use Protect our islands / islets Protect mountains slopes, river banks No account of agricultural land that is being released for other uses or for speculation Environment Urbanisation More initiatives to be taken on the basis of the Mauritius Strategy for Small Island Developing States (SIDs ) Forests Preserve forests areas/ plant trees Agriculture Encourage food production for self sufficiency Sustainable Agriculture / Bio products Water Water Management, Collect and Use rainwater High standard potable water / discourage use of bottle water Sustainable consumption and production Encourage self-sufficiency / grow more food Encourage rearing of pigs / poultry / cattle etc Use of eco-friendly products mainly at domestic level Sustainable production and consumption Use of recycled paper Pollution, waste, environmental health Air quality Stricter control & enforcement, EIA studies, Mitigation measures for climate change Control vehicles' emissions Noise Control vehicles' exhaust, loud music, etc. Odour Waste collection, segregation and recycling.

How ever, evaluation should be mentioned prominently in the Policy. "}
