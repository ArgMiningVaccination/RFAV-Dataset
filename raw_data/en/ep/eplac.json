The immune systems of patients with diabetes consider transplanted biomedical devices foreign objects. As pictured, one of the devices is crystalline drug-loaded hydrogels that hold insulin-producing islets. In turn, the immune system rejects the device. The body can't remove it, so the immune system traps it by sealing it behind scar tissue, leading to internal islet death, and making the treatment ineffective. [Johns ](https://www.instagram.com/hopkinsmedicine/) [Hopkins Medicine](https://www.instagram.com/HopkinsMedicine/) biomedical engineer Joshua Doloff and Shady Farah at [The Technion](https://www.instagram.com/technion.israel/) received a $700,000 grant from [JDRF](https://www.instagram.com/jdrfhq/) to ensure these treatments have long-term success. They aim to create a drug delivery system with anti-inflammatory medications. That way, the delivery system protects the device and makes the treatment last for a prolonged period of time.
