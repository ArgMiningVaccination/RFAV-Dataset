It produces lactic and [acetic acid](https://www.webmd.com/drugs/2/drug-13965/acetic+acid+otic/details). \"Good\" bacteria such as B. lactis can help break down food, absorb nutrients, and fight off \"bad\" organisms that might cause diseases. B. lactis is a subspecies of B. animalis. It's found in the human gut and used in probiotic [supplements](https://www.webmd.com/men/video/lamm-supplements-diet). People use B. lactis for excessive ( [colic](https://www.webmd.com/parenting/baby/understanding-colic-basics)), [constipation](https://www.webmd.com/digestive-disorders/digestive-diseases-constipation), [irritable bowel syndrome](https://www.webmd.com/ibs/ss/slideshow-ibs-overview)( [IBS](https://www.webmd.com/ibs/guide/irritable-bowel-syndrome-overview-facts)), and respiratory tract is also used for dental [cavities](https://www.webmd.com/oral-health/dental-health-cavities), [hay fever](https://www.webmd.com/allergies/rhinitis), [diarrhea](https://www.webmd.com/digestive-disorders/digestive-diseases-diarrhea), and many other conditions, but there is no good scientific evidence to support many of these uses. There is also no good evidence to support using B. lactis for COVID-19. Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis is sometimes listed as Bifidobacterium lactis (or B. lactis) on product labels. Don't confuse B. lactis with other [probiotics](https://www.webmd.com/digestive-disorders/features/answers-to-your-questions-about-probiotics), or with fermented food products such as fermented milk, kefir, or yogurt. These are not the same. Uses & Effectiveness ? Possibly Effective for - Excessive crying in infants ( [colic](https://www.webmd.com/parenting/baby/what-is-colic)). Giving infants B. lactis by [mouth](https://www.webmd.com/oral-health/ss/slideshow-mouth-problems)seems to help reduce crying from [colic](https://www.webmd.com/parenting/baby/rm-quiz-baby-colic). - Constipation. Taking B. lactis by [mouth](https://www.webmd.com/oral-health/rm-quiz-mouth-myths)seems to help relieve constipation. - A long-term disorder of the large [intestines](https://www.webmd.com/digestive-disorders/rm-quiz-intestines)that causes [stomach pain](https://www.webmd.com/pain-management/abdominal-pain-causes-treatments)( [irritable bowel syndrome](https://www.webmd.com/ibs/video/drossman-what-is-ibs)or [IBS](https://www.webmd.com/ibs/default.htm)). Taking B. by mouth seems to help relieve [symptoms of IBS](https://www.webmd.com/ibs/symptoms-irritable-bowel-syndrome-ibs). But it's not clear if taking it together with other probiotics helps. - Infection of the airways. Taking B. lactis by mouth might help prevent airway infections such as the common cold in otherwise healthy people. But it doesn't seem to help people who have other serious health issues. Possibly Ineffective for - Cavities. Taking B. lactis by mouth doesn't seem to prevent cavities in young children. Side Effects Special Precautions and Warnings Pregnancy and [breast](https://www.webmd.com/women/picture-of-the-breasts)-feeding: There isn't enough reliable information to know if B. lactis is safe to use when pregnant or breast-feeding. Stay on the safe side and avoid use. Children: B. lactis likely safe for healthy children when taken by mouth for up to 8 months. It might cause diarrhea in some kids. Weakened [immune system](https://www.webmd.com/cold-and-flu/immune-system-function): Some probiotics have caused [blood](https://www.webmd.com/heart/anatomy-picture-of-blood)infections in a small number of people with weakened immune systems. If you have a weakened immune system, talk with your [healthcare](https://www.webmd.com/health-insurance/rm-quiz-insurance-basics)provider before taking B. lactis. Interactions ? Antibiotic drugs interacts with BIFIDOBACTERIUM ANIMALIS SUBSP. LACTIS B. lactis is a type of friendly bacteria. Antibiotics are used to reduce harmful bacteria in the body. Taking antibiotics along with B. lactis might reduce the effects of B. lactis. To avoid this interaction, take B. lactis products at least two hours before or after antibiotics. Moderate Interaction Be cautious with this combination Dosing [healthcare](https://www.webmd.com/health-insurance/video/what-is-the-aca)provider to find out what dose might be best for a specific condition.
