Strong demand for heart failure medicine Entresto , psoriasis and autoimmune disease treatment Cosentyx , and recently launched therapies such as multiple sclerosis drug Kesimpta helped us increase sales and net profit as we maintained cost discipline. Looking ahead, we are con - fident we can maintain our momentum as we remain focused on operational excellence and science-based innovation. With more than 12 new drug approvals by the US Food and Drug Administration in the past five years, we are committed to our long-term research and development (R&D) strategy, which is aimed at creating breakthrough therapies for patients with high unmet medical needs. We strive to build leading market positions in fast-grow - ing areas of medicine and broaden patient reach to deliver on our purpose to improve and extend people's lives around the world. Last year we continued to make significant investments in R&D, including in cutting-edge medical technologies such as radioligand therapy and small-interfering RNA. Our clinical pipeline covers a diverse area of noncommu - nicable diseases such as cancer and heart disease. This is positioning us well for the future amid the rising global need for innovative chronic therapies as we continue to strengthen patient engagement. We started a strategic review of our Sandoz generics divi - sion with the goal of strengthening its operational perfor - mance and maximizing shareholder return. Also, we divested our investment in Roche Holding AG, reflecting our strategy to create a focused medicines company. Acute pressure on societies and healthcare systems due to the COVID-19 pandemic remains high. In this challeng - ing environment, our focus on operational excellence and shift to flexible working by our employees continued to help us navigate the crisis. In a post-pandemic world, these lessons will enable us to maintain high levels of resilience and operational efficiency while continuing to position us as an employer of choice in a changing work environment. We also made further progress in our environmental, social and governance (ESG) activities, which are an essential part of our strategy and an important reputa - tion driver. Besides our progress in reducing our environ - mental footprint, we broadened patient access to our strategic medicines and launched a new program in the United States to address health disparities - all with the intention to create more equitable and sustainable health - care systems and support the United Nations' efforts to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals. The Board of Directors took further action to strengthen governance. We paved the way for comprehensive ESG oversight and changed the leadership of the Compensa - tion Committee and the Governance, Nomination and Corporate Responsibilities Committee. We also nomi - nated a new Board member. Together with the Executive Committee, the Board of Directors will continue the inten - sive dialogue with all stakeholder groups with a view to further strengthen trust in society and to maximize share - holder return. I thank you for the confidence you have placed in our company and am pleased to be able to propose a divi - dend increase of 3.3% to CHF 3.10 at the next Annual General Meeting. Sincerely, Joerg Reinhardt Chairman of the Board of Directors II CEO's letter 2021 was another year of rapid change for the biopharma - ceutical industry and the world. The pandemic continues to disrupt care for patients across the spectrum of disease, creating a syndemic, or confluence of epidemics, that requires healthcare systems to cope with COVID-19 while caring for patients with chronic diseases. Through the challenges ahead, there are reasons to be optimistic a healthier future is within our grasp - includ - ing the ways our industry has brought to this crisis the power of technology and shown once again the extraor - dinary ability of science to overcome humanity's greatest tests. As we reimagine medicine at Novartis, our unwavering focus on our strategy and purpose enabled us to continue creating value for patients, healthcare professionals, healthcare systems, employees, shareholders and soci - ety. The adaptability and commitment of our employees, together with the resilience of our operations and capa - bilities in data science and tech nology, minimized disrup - tions to our business. Many changes, such as hybrid work - ing, are now business as usual. Our impact on the world remains extraordinary, with 766 million patients reached in 2021. We received 21 approv - als in the US, the EU, Japan and China, including two new mole cular entities. Our siRNA therapy Leqvio is now approved in more than 50 countries, including the US. We also demonstrated the strength of our in-market portfo - lio, , Kesimpta and Kisqali driving growth. Our pipeline promises innovation for years to come. We have built depth in five therapeutic areas and are building scale in five next-generation technology platforms. 2021 saw important data readouts, including for Kisqali in HR+/ HER2- advanced breast cancer, and for 177Lu-PSMA-617, our investigational targeted radioligand therapy for patients with advanced prostate cancer, which received breakthrough therapy designation by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). We also received approval for Scemblix , a novel stamp inhibitor for the treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia. We have a promising mid- and late-stage portfolio, with more than 20 assets with expected approval by 2026 that each have sales potential over USD 1 billion. We also initi - ated a share buyback of up to USD 15 billion, underscor - ing our confidence in our mid- and long-term pipeline and growth outlook. Progressing on our journey to build trust with society and furthering our legacy in global health and access, in 2021 Novartis reached the milestone of delivering a staggering 1 billion courses of malaria treatment to people in endemic countries. We continue delivering on our longstanding commitment to expand access, narrowing the time it takes to scale our latest innovations. Our progress was under - scored by improved environmental, social and gover - nance (ESG) ratings, and we once again ranked second in the Access to Medicine Index. We continued to go big on data science and digital tech - nologies, integrating our data and digital teams within Customer & Technology Solutions to maximize efficiency as we scale value-driving projects. For example, AI Nurse, developed in collaboration with Tencent, helps patients with heart failure and other cardiovascular diseases man - age disease progression. It is used by 300 000 patients in China. Novartis also continued doing our part to end the pan - demic, quickly scaling up production of COVID-19 vac - cines. We're proud to have helped develop a potential new treatment option with Molecular Partners. Our financial performance highlights the progress we've made and drives confidence for the future - with 4% growth in net sales and 6% growth in core operating income from the previous year. We're confident we'll drive consistent growth to 2030 and beyond. We've also initi - ated a strategic review of Sandoz to enable Sandoz to be positioned as a long-term leader in the generics industry. Emerging from the COVID-19 pande mic, I remain optimis - tic about a new era in medicine. Stakeholders like you play an important role in that. On behalf of all of us at Novartis, we're grateful for your contributions on the journey of reimagining medicine.

Information on the Company,\" and \"Item 5. Operating and Financial Review and Prospects.\" Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect, actual results may vary materially from those described in this Annual Report as anticipated, believed, estimated or expected. We provide the information in this Annual Report as of the date of its filing. We do not intend, and do not assume any obligation, to update any information or forward-looking statements set out in this Annual Report as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.Item 1. Identity of Directors, Senior Management and Advisers 7PART I Item 1. Identity of Directors, Senior Management and Advisers Not applicable.Item 2. Offer Statistics and Expected Timetable 8Item 2. Offer Statistics and Expected Timetable Not applicable.Item 3. Key Information 9Item 3. Key Information 3.A Selected financial data Not applicable. 3.B Capitalization and indebtedness Not applicable. 3.C Reasons for the offer and use of proceeds Not applicable. 3.D Risk factors Our businesses face significant risks and uncertainties. You should carefully consider all of the information set forth in this Annual Report and in other documents we file with or furnish to the SEC, including the following risk factors, before deciding to invest in or to maintain an investment in any Novartis securities. Our business, as well as our reputation, financial condition, results of oper - ations, and share price, could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks, as well as other risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or not currently considered material. Strategic risks Key products and commercial priorities Risk description Failure to deliver key commercial priorities and success - fully launch new products Context and potential impact Our ability to maintain and grow our business and to replace revenue and income lost to generic, biosimilar and other competition depends heavily on the commer - cial success of our new or existing key products. The commercial success of these products could be impacted at any time by a number of factors, including pressure from new or existing competitive products, changes in the prescribing habits of healthcare professionals, unex - pected side effects or safety signals, supply chain issues or other product shortages, pricing pressure, regulatory proceedings, changes in labeling, loss of intellectual property protection, and global pandemics. In addition, our revenue and margins could be significantly impacted by the timing and rate of commercial acceptance of new products. Healthcare professionals, patients and payers may choose competitor products instead of ours for various reasons, including if they perceive them to be better in terms of efficacy, safety, cost, convenience or other rea - sons. The commercial success of our key products and launches in the face of increasing competition requires significant attention and management focus. Such com - petitive products could significantly affect the revenue from our products and our results of operations. This impact could also be compounded to the extent such competition results in us making significant additional investments in research and development, marketing or sales. Pricing, reimbursement and access Risk description Pricing and reimbursement pressure, including access to healthcare Context and potential impact Our businesses experience significant pressures on the pricing of our products and on our ability to obtain and maintain satisfactory rates of reimbursement for our products by governments, insurers and other payers. These pressures have many sources, including growth of healthcare costs as a percentage of gross domestic product; funding restrictions and policy changes; man - agement of the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on healthcare spending; and public controversies, political debate, investigations and legal proceedings regarding pharmaceutical pricing. Pressures on pricing may nega - tively impact both our product pricing and the availabil - ity of our products. Item 3. Key Information 10In addition, we face numerous cost -containment measures imposed by governments and other payers, including government -imposed industrywide price reductions, mandatory pricing systems, reference pric - ing systems, payers limiting access to treatments based on cost -benefit analyses, importation of drugs from low - er-cost countries to higher -cost countries, shifting of the payment burden to patients through higher co -payments and co-pay accumulator programs, limiting physicians' ability to choose among competing medicines, manda - tory substitution of generic drugs for the patented equiv - alent, pressure on physicians to reduce the prescribing of patented prescription medicines, increasing pressure on intellectual property protections, and growing require - ments for increased transparency on pricing. For more information on price controls, see \"Item 4. Information on the Company\u2014Item 4.B Business overview\u2014 Innovative Medicines\u2014Price controls.\" These challenges are expected to intensify in 2022 and beyond as political and budget pressures mount, and healthcare payers around the globe, including gov - ernment -controlled health authorities, insurance com - panies and managed care organizations, step up initia - tives to reduce the overall cost of healthcare, restrict access to higher -priced new medicines, increase the use of generics, and impose overall price cuts. These factors may materially affect our ability to achieve value-based prices and maintain an acceptable return on our invest - ments in the research and development of our products, and may impact our ability to research and develop new products. In addition, our Sandoz Division has faced and may continue to face intense competition from other generic and biosimilar pharmaceutical companies, which aggres - sively compete for market share, including through sig - nificant price competition. Such competitive actions may increase the costs and risks associated with our efforts to introduce and market generic and biosimilar products, may delay the introduction or marketing of such prod - ucts, and may further limit the prices at which we are able to sell these products. In particular, in the US in past years, industrywide price competition among generic pharmaceutical companies and consolidation of buyers caused significant declines in sales and profits of Sandoz. Research and development Risk description Failure or delay in the research and development of new products or new indications for existing products Context and potential impact We engage in extensive and costly research and devel - opment activities, both through our own internal resources and through collaborations with third parties, in an effort to identify and develop new products and new indications for existing products that address unmet and changing medical needs and are commercially suc - cessful. Our ability to grow our business; to replace sales lost due to branded competition, entry of generics, or other reasons; and to bring to market products that take advantage of new and potentially disruptive technolo - gies, including cell, gene and radioligand therapies, depends in significant part upon the success of these efforts. Research and development of new products of our Innovative Medicines Division, including the research and development of our cell and gene therapies, is a costly, lengthy and uncertain process. Because intellectual property protections are limited in scope and duration, the longer it takes to develop a product, the less time there may be for us to recoup our research and devel - opment costs before loss of exclusivity. Failure can occur at any point in the process, including in later stages after substantial investment. In spite of such substantial invest - ment, there can be no guarantee that our research and development activities will produce commercially suc - cessful new products that will enable us to replace rev - enue and income lost to competition and to grow our business. See also \"Item 4. Information on the Com - pany\u2014Item 4.B Business overview\u2014Innovative Medicines\u2014Research and development\" with regards to the research and development efforts of our Innovative Medicines Division. New products must undergo intensive preclinical and clinical testing, and must be approved by means of a highly complex, lengthy and expensive approval pro - cesses that can vary from country to country. Further, regulatory authorities continue to establish new and increasingly rigorous and time-consuming requirements for approval and reimbursement of new products and new indications. Similarly, the post -approval regulatory burden has also increased. These requirements make the maintenance of regulatory approvals for our prod - ucts increasingly expensive, and further heighten the risk of recalls, product withdrawals, change to product spec - ifications, loss of market share, and loss of revenue and profitability. The clinical testing, regulatory processes and post-approval activities described above become more difficult during pandemics, such as the COVID-19 pandemic. This is primarily due to challenges related to recruiting, enrolling and treating patients in clinical trials. In addition, travel restrictions resulting from pandemics make it more difficult for regulatory authorities to inspect sites. For a further description of the research and devel - opment and approval processes for the products of our Innovative Medicines Division, see the sections headed \"Research and development\" and \"Regulation\" included in the description of our Innovative Medicines Division under \"Item 4. Information on the Company\u2014Item 4.B Business overview\u2014Innovative Medicines.\" Our Sandoz Division has made, and expects to con - tinue to make, significant investments in the development of biotechnology -based, \"biologic\" medicines intended for sale as bioequivalent or \"biosimilar\" versions of cur - rently marketed biotechnology products. While the development of such products typically is significantly less costly and complex than the development of the equivalent originator medicines, it is nonetheless signifi - cantly more costly and complex than that for typical small-molecule generic products. See also \"Item 4. Infor - mation on the Company\u2014Item 4.B Business overview\u2014Sandoz\u2014Development and registration\" with regards to the research and development efforts of our Sandoz Divi - sion. In addition, many countries do not yet have fully developed legislative or regulatory pathways to facilitate Item 3. Key Information 11the development of biosimilars and permit their sale in a manner in which they are readily substitutable alterna - tives to the originator product. Further delays or difficul - ties in the development or marketing of biosimilars could put at risk the significant investments that Sandoz has made, and will continue to make, in its Biopharmaceuti - cals business. Failure to successfully develop and mar - ket biosimilars could have a material adverse effect on the success of the Sandoz Division and the Group as a whole. For more information about the approval pro - cesses that must be followed to market Sandoz Division products, see \"Item 4. Information on the Company\u2014Item 4.B Business overview\u2014Sandoz\u2014Regulation.\" Further, our research and development activities must be con - ducted in an ethical and compliant manner. Among other things, we are concerned with patient safety (both pre- and post-product approval), data privacy, Current Good Clinical Practices (cGCP) requirements, data integrity, the fair treatment of patients, and animal welfare. Should we fail to properly manage such issues, we risk injury to third parties, damage to our reputation, negative finan - cial consequences as a result of potential claims for dam - ages, sanctions and fines, and the potential that invest - ments in research and development activities could have no benefit to the Group. Research to find new targets for drug discovery and the therapeutic agents to treat unmet medical needs is made more difficult during pan - demics, such as the COVID-19 pandemic. This is primar - ily due to safety-related restrictions on the ability of lab - oratory scientists to work in research laboratories, and impacts our ability to collaborate with academic and commercial research organizations facing similar chal - lenges and restrictions. Alliances, acquisitions and divestments Risk description Failure to identify external business opportunities or real - ize the expected benefits from our strategic acquisitions or divestments Context and potential impact As part of our strategy, from time to time we acquire and divest products or entire businesses, and enter into stra - tegic alliances and collaborations. For example, in Feb - ruary 2021, we closed the in-licensing of tislelizumab from an affiliate of BeiGene, Ltd. for North America, Europe and Japan. This strategy depends in part on our ability to identify strategic external business opportuni - ties and to move forward with such opportunities on acceptable terms. Once a strategic transaction is agreed upon with a third party, we may not be able to complete the transac - tion in a timely manner or at all, nor can we be sure that pre-transaction due diligence will identify all possible issues that might arise during and after the transaction. Our efforts on such transactions can also divert man - agement's attention from our existing businesses. After a transaction, efforts to develop and market acquired or licensed products, to integrate the acquired business or to achieve expected synergies may fail or may not fully meet expectations, as a result of difficulties in retaining key personnel, customers and suppliers; fail - ure to obtain marketing approval or reimbursement within expected time frames or at all; differences in corporate culture, standards, controls, processes and policies; or other factors. Transactions can also result in liabilities being incurred that were not known at the time of acqui - sition, or the creation of tax or accounting issues. Acquired businesses are not always in full compliance with legal, regulatory or Novartis standards, including, for example, Current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP) or cGCP standards, which can be costly and time-consuming to remedy. Also, our strategic alliances and collaborations with third parties may not achieve their intended goals and objectives within expected time frames, or at all. Similarly, we cannot ensure that we will be able to successfully divest or spin off businesses or other assets that we have identified for this purpose, or that any com - pleted divestment or spin-off will achieve the expected strategic benefits, operational efficiencies or opportuni - ties, or that the divestment or spin-off will ultimately max - imize shareholder value. Intellectual property Risk description Expiry, assertion or loss of intellectual property protec - tion Context and potential impact Many products of our Innovative Medicines Division are protected by intellectual property rights, which may pro - vide us with exclusive rights to market those products for a limited time and enable our purpose of reimagining medicine by sustainably financing our research and development. However, the strength and duration of those rights can vary significantly from product to prod - uct and country to country, and they may be success - fully challenged by third parties or governmental author - ities. Loss of intellectual property protection and the intro - duction of generic or biosimilar competition for a pat - ented branded medicine in a country typically result in a significant and rapid reduction in net sales and operat - ing income for the branded product. Such competition can occur after successful challenges to intellectual property rights or the regular expiration of the patent term or other intellectual property rights. Such compe - tition can also result from the entry of generic or biosim - ilar versions of another medicine in the same therapeu - tic class as one of our drugs or in a competing therapeutic class, from a Declaration of Public Interest or the compulsory licensing of our intellectual property by governmental authorities, or as a result of a general weakening of intellectual property and governing laws in certain countries around the world. In addition, generic or biosimilar manufacturers may sometimes conduct so-called \"launches at risk\" of products that are still under legal challenge for infringement, or whose patents are still under legal challenge for validity, before final res - olution of legal proceedings. We also rely in all aspects of our businesses on unpat - ented proprietary technology, know-how, trade secrets and other confidential information, which we seek to pro - tect through various measures, including confidentiality agreements with licensees, employees, third-party col -Item 3. Key Information 12laborators and consultants who may have access to such information. If these agreements are breached or our other protective measures should fail, then our contrac - tual or other remedies may not be adequate to cover our losses. We may also be subject to assertions of intellectual property rights against our innovative medicines by third parties. If successful, these actions may involve payment of future royalties or damages, for example for patent infringement, and may also involve injunctive relief requir - ing removal of one or more dosage strengths of a prod - uct from the market (or removal of a therapeutic indica - tion from the product's approved labeling) for some period of time or throughout the life of the asserted intel - lectual property right. Such damages or such an injunc - tion may have a material impact on our operating income and net sales. In any given year, we may experience a potentially significant impact on our net sales from products that have already lost intellectual property protections, as well as products that may lose protection during the year. Because we may have substantially reduced marketing and research and development expenses related to products that are in their final years of exclusivity, the initial loss of protection for a product during a given year could also have an impact on our operating income for that year in an amount corresponding to a significant portion of the product's lost sales. The magnitude of the impact of generic or biosimilar competition on our income could depend on a number of factors, including, with respect to income in a given year, the time of year at which the generic or biosimilar competitor is launched; the ease or difficulty of manufacturing a competitor prod - uct and obtaining regulatory approval to market it; the number of generic or biosimilar competitor products approved, including whether, in the US, a single compet - itor is granted an exclusive marketing period; whether an authorized generic is launched; the geographies in which generic or biosimilar competitor products are approved, including the strength of the market for generic or bio - similar pharmaceutical products in such geographies, and the comparative profitability of branded pharmaceu - tical products in such geographies; and our ability to suc - cessfully develop and launch new products for patients that may also offset the income lost to generic or bio - similar competition. For more information on the patent and generic competition status of our Innovative Medicines Division products, see \"Item 4. Information on the Company\u2014Item 4.B Business overview\u2014Innovative Medicines\u2014Intellectual property.\" Environmental, social and governance matters Risk description Failure to meet environmental, social and governance expectations Context and potential impact Increasingly, in addition to financial results, companies are being judged by performance on a variety of envi - ronmental, social and governance (ESG) matters, which can contribute to the long-term sustainability of our com - panies' performance. An inability to successfully perform on ESG matters and meet societal expectations can result in negative impacts to our reputation, recruitment, retention, operations, financial results and share price. A variety of organizations measure the performance of companies on ESG topics, and the results of these assessments are widely publicized. In addition, invest - ment in funds that specialize in companies that perform well in such assessments are increasingly popular, and major institutional investors have publicly emphasized the importance of such ESG measures in making their investment decisions. Topics taken into account in such assessments include, among others, the unintentional costs or benefits of our actions on third parties not involved in such actions, which may impact society and the environment, such as with respect to climate change, the degradation of biodiversity, and inequality in society. In particular, the resulting costs of such actions may in the long term impact our operations and ability to achieve our strategic goals, ultimately resulting in broader neg - ative impacts on the value of Novartis. Therefore, the role of our Board of Directors and executive officers in super - vising various sustainability issues is becoming increas - ingly important. In addition to the topics typically consid - ered in such assessments in the healthcare industry, the public's ability to access our medicines is particularly important. If our advocacy and lobbying efforts are not aligned with our publicly stated ESG targets, our purpose statement or societal expectations, our performance on ESG assessments may be negatively impacted. We actively manage a broad range of such ESG mat - ters, taking into consideration their expected impact on the sustainability of our business over time, and the potential impact of our business on society and the envi - ronment. We recently created an ESG Management Office, which is tasked with developing our ESG strategy and tracking our performance against our ESG targets. However, in light of investors' increasing focus on ESG matters and rapidly changing views on acceptable lev - els of action across a range of topics, there can be no certainty that we will manage such issues successfully, that the ESG standards we use to create our ESG tar - gets and currently use to measure our performance against will remain the same, or that we will successfully meet society's or investors' expectations. Sandoz business transformation Risk description Inability to drive sustainable growth mid-term by pursu - ing biosimilars and inorganic growth opportunities Context and potential impact Our Sandoz Division operates in a challenging generics and biosimilars market, where it faces intense competi - tion and continued pricing pressures as it seeks to increase its market share and achieve sustainable and profitable growth mid-term. To achieve this objective, we are implementing a strategy for Sandoz focused on sev - eral goals, including accelerating biosimilars growth in the long term, rebuilding the Sandoz US business, and achieving inorganic growth by identifying and success - fully executing on merger and acquisition and strategic in-licensing partnership opportunities on acceptable terms. There is no guarantee that we will achieve our strategic goals for Sandoz within the expected time Item 3. Key Information 13frame, or at all. Concurrently with implementing this strat - egy, in October 2021 we announced the commencement of a strategic review of our Sandoz Division. This review will explore all options, ranging from retaining the busi - ness to separation, to determine how best to maximize value for our shareholders. As a result, our inability to achieve these strategic goals or to successfully imple - ment any proposed actions arising out of the strategic review could have a material adverse effect on the suc - cess of the Sandoz Division and the Group as a whole, and may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, the stra - tegic review itself will utilize additional employee and management time as well as Company resources that could be allocated to other areas of our business, which may negatively impact our overall Company perfor - mance. See also \"\u2014Pricing, reimbursement and access\" with regards to the price competition for our Sandoz Divi - sion, \"\u2014Research and development\" with regards to our research and development efforts related to the biosim - ilars market, and \"\u2014Alliances, acquisitions and divest - ments.\" Emerging business models Risk description Missed opportunities in digitalization and emerging busi - ness models Context and potential impact Rapid progress in medical and digital technologies and in the development of new business models is substan - tially transforming our industry and is creating new busi - nesses and new opportunities for improving patient care and increasing revenue and profit, while sometimes quickly rendering established businesses uncompetitive or obsolete. Such transformations, both positive and negative, may impact the healthcare industry overall. Numerous tech companies are seeking to enter into the healthcare field, from research and development to phar - maceutical distribution and the delivery of care, which generates opportunities for technology partnerships that may accelerate innovation and complement our capabilities. However, this may also potentially disrupt our relationships with patients, healthcare professionals, customers, distributors and suppliers, with potentially negative consequences for us. To take advantage of these opportunities, we have embarked upon a digital transformation strategy, with the goal of becoming an industry leader in leveraging advanced analytics and digital technologies, which was accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic. We expect to invest substantial resources into efforts to improve the way we use data in drug discovery and development; to gain insights into customer preferences and behaviors via data science; to improve the ways we engage with patients, doctors and other stakeholders; and to auto - mate business processes. Our success in these efforts will depend on many factors, including data quality, tech - nology architecture, partnering with the right technology companies, training our employees to fully capitalize on the new capabilities, attracting and retaining employees with appropriate skills and mindsets, and successfully innovating across a variety of technology fields. Our efforts in some of these initiatives have started to gain significant traction. However, we do not yet know if these changes will be sustainable as we scale and make them part of our ways of working. As a result, we may ultimately fail to either create innovative new products, tools or techniques in an adequate time frame, or fail to differen - tiate our products and business models via digital tech - nologies. Furthermore, our increasing use of social media and other digital engagement platforms carries risks related to potential violations of rules regulating the promotion of prescription medicines and the potential disclosure of confidential information, trade secrets, or loss of other intellectual property. As a result of the COVID-19 pan - demic, the use of social media and other digital engage - ment platforms has increased and is expanding into new uses. There continue to be uncertainties as to the rules that apply to such communications and as to the inter - pretations that health authorities will apply in this con - text, and as a result, despite our efforts to comply with applicable rules, there is a risk that our use of social media and other digital engagement platforms may cause us to be found in violation of applicable regula - tions. In addition, the market for our products is evolving rapidly with frequent changes in scientific evidence, sig - nificant advances in availability and utilization of real- world evidence (RWE), and the acceleration in the adop - tion of virtual and social media and other digital engagement platforms by customers, patients and other stakeholders, which may allow us to (i) better understand the appropriate utilization of our products through RWE, (ii) engage and appropriately educate customers, patients and other stakeholders about the benefits and risks associated with our products, and (iii) increase the efficiency of our engagement with customers. Failure to effectively utilize these increasingly important channels and sources of evidence can result in the inadequate education of customers regarding the benefits and risks of our products and the loss of market share. In addition, there is risk of inappropriate utilization of this data and these channels by our employees or vendors. Operational risks Cybersecurity and IT systems Risk description Cybersecurity breaches and catastrophic loss of IT sys - tems Context and potential impact We are heavily dependent on critical, complex and inter - dependent information technology (IT) systems, includ - ing internet -based systems to support our business pro - cesses. We also have outsourced significant parts of our IT infrastructure to third-party providers, and we cur - rently use these providers to perform business-critical IT services for us. We are therefore vulnerable to cyber - security attacks and incidents on such networks and systems, whether our own or those of the third-party providers we contract, and we have experienced and may in the future experience such cybersecurity threats Item 3. Key Information 14and attacks. Cybersecurity threats and attacks take many forms, and the size, age and complexity of our IT systems make them potentially vulnerable to external and internal security threats; outages; malicious intru data; pro - gramming or human errors; or other similar events. In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, the risk of such threats and attacks has increased, as virtual and remote working has become more widely used, and sensitive data is accessed by employees working in less secure, home-based environments. In addition, due to our reli - ance on third-party providers, we have experienced and may in the future experience interruptions, delays or out - ages in IT service availability due to a variety of factors outside of our control, including technical failures, natu - ral disasters, fraud, or security attacks experienced by or caused by the third-party provider. Interruptions in the service provided by these third parties could affect our ability to perform critical tasks. A significant information security or other event, such as a disruption or loss of availability of one or more of our IT systems, whether managed by us or a third-party service provider, has previously and could in the future negatively impact important business processes, such as the conduct of scientific research and clinical trials, the submission of data and information to health author - ities, our manufacturing and supply chain processes, our shipments to customers, our compliance with legal obli - gations, and communication between employees and with third parties. IT issues have previously led to, and could in the future lead to, the compromise of trade secrets or other intellectual property that could be sold and used by competitors to accelerate the development or manufacturing of competing products; to the compro - mise of personal financial and health information; and to the compromise of IT security data such as usernames, passwords and encryption keys, as well as security strat - egies and information about network infrastructure, which could allow unauthorized parties to gain access to additional systems or data. In addition, malfunctions in software or medical devices that make significant use of IT could lead to a risk of direct harm to patients. Although we have experienced some of the events described above, to date they have not had a material impact on our operations. Nonetheless, the occurrence of any of the events described above in the future could disrupt our business operations and result in enforce - ment actions or liability, including potential government fines and penalties, claims for damages, and shareholder litigation or allegations that the public health, or the health of individuals, has been harmed. Any significant events of this type could require us to expend significant resources beyond those we already invest to remediate any damage, to further modify or enhance our protective measures, and to enable the con - tinuity of our business. Third-party management Risk description Failure to maintain adequate governance and oversight over third-party relationships, and failure of third parties to meet their contractual, regulatory or other obligationsContext and potential impact We outsource the performance of certain key business functions to third parties, and invest a significant amount of effort and resources into doing so, including to man - age and oversee such third parties. Such outsourced functions include research and development collabora - tions, manufacturing operations, warehousing and dis - tribution activities, certain finance functions, sales and marketing activities, data management and others. Some of these third parties, particularly those in developing countries, do not have internal compliance systems com - parable to those within our organization. Our reliance on outsourcing and third parties for the research and development, sales or manufacturing of our products poses certain risks, including misappropri - ation of our intellectual property, failure of the third party to comply with regulatory and quality assurance require - ments, unexpected supply disruptions, breach of the research and development or manufacturing agreement by the third party, and the unexpected termination or nonrenewal of the agreement by the third party. In addition, governments and the public expect com - panies like Novartis to take responsibility for and report on compliance with various human rights, responsible sourcing and environmental practices, as well as other actions of their third-party contractors around the world. Ultimately, if third parties fail to meet their obligations to us, we may lose our investment in the collaborations or fail to receive the expected benefits of our agreements with such third parties. In addition, should any of these third parties fail to comply with the law or our standards, or should they otherwise act inappropriately in the course of their performance of services for us, there is a risk that we could be held responsible for their acts, that our reputation may suffer, and that penalties may be imposed upon us. Manufacturing and product quality Risk description Inability to ensure proper controls in product develop - ment and product manufacturing, and failure to comply with applicable regulations and standards Context and potential impact The development and manufacture of our products is complex and heavily regulated by governmental health authorities around the world. Whether or not our prod - ucts and the related raw materials are developed and manufactured at our own manufacturing sites or by third parties, we must ensure that all development and man - ufacturing processes comply with regulatory require - ments as well as our own quality standards in order to deliver novel therapies to patients with unmet needs while ensuring patient safety. Failure to comply with reg - ulatory requirements has resulted in, and may in the future result in, warning letters, suspension of manufac - turing, seizure of products, injunctions, product recalls, failure to secure product approvals, or debarment. In recent years, global health authorities have sub - stantially intensified their scrutiny of manufacturers' compliance with regulatory requirements. Any significant failure by us or our third-party suppliers to comply with regulatory requirements, or with health authorities' Item 3. Key Information 15expectations, may create the need to suspend clinical trials, shut down production facilities or production lines, and recall commercial products. A failure to fully comply with regulatory requirements could also lead to a delay in the approval of new products, an inability to ship or import our products, and significant penalties and repu - tational harm. Fragmented IT landscape and Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) and Enterprise Data Management (EDM) implementation Risk description Fragmented business processes and unclear data own - ership may impact future digital opportunities, including the implementation of the new ERP system and EDM governance Context and potential impact We rely on various information and other business sys - tems to leverage data in order to operate our complex global business. Historically, while there are highly over - lapping data strategy and architectural needs across our business units, we have taken the approach of building distinct solutions across both business units and geog - raphies, which may cause disruptions to our operational stability. We are currently in the design and planning phase for the implementation of a new global ERP sys - tem that seeks to simplify, standardize and digitize pro - cesses in our commercial and finance functions and our Novartis Technical Operations unit to help ensure effi - cient and compliant business operations across busi - ness units and geographies as well as the availability of high-quality data necessary to aid our decision-making. We expect the first implementation of our new ERP sys - tem to begin in the second half of 2023, with full imple - mentation by 2028, when our current system is out of maintenance by the software provider. Implementing and operating a new ERP system involves certain risks, including a failure of the new system to operate as expected, a failure to properly integrate with other sys - tems we use, potential loss of data or information, com - pliance issues, cost overruns and delays, and operational disruptions. Any disruptions or malfunctions of our new ERP system could cause critical information we use to be delayed, defective, corrupted, inadequate or inacces - sible. In addition, if the design or implementation of our new ERP system is deficient, it could adversely affect our operations, and could negatively impact the effec - tiveness of our internal controls. T alent management Risk description Inability to attract, integrate and retain key personnel and qualified individuals Context and potential impact We rely on a diverse, highly skilled workforce across our businesses and functions. Novartis invests in attracting, integrating and retaining talented individuals to achieve our business objectives. If we are unable to sufficiently attract, integrate and retain key personnel - including senior members of our scientific and management teams, high -quality researchers and development spe - cialists, and skilled personnel in key markets - our abil - ity to achieve our major business objectives may be adversely affected, our brand and reputation could be negatively impacted, and the diversity of our workforce may decline. Our future growth will depend on our ability to retain key talent and leaders while also recruiting new talent who bring new skills and perspectives. The market for skilled talent has become increasingly competitive. We are experiencing challenges in attracting and retaining skilled talent in several areas, including biology, chemis - try, clinical development, drug manufacturing, IT and, in particular, our Oncology business unit and advanced technology platforms (i.e., our chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CAR-T) therapies, gene therapies and radioligand therapies). In addition, biotechnology companies have seen and continue to see a significant inflow of capital, and are not only competing with us to attract the same skilled talent but are also aggressively pursuing our experienced talent, threatening our ability to sustain a skilled talent supply to deliver on our business priorities. The constraints associated with lockdowns during the COVID-19 pandemic accelerated the need for more flexible working models. We addressed this need through our program called Choice with Responsibility, which now gives many employees the flexibility to determine, in consultation with their teams, where, when and how they work, while remaining in compliance with any tax, legal and other limitations. Our transition toward a more flexible working model accelerated our efforts to expand our recruitment of talent from an increasingly global pool. However, the external supply of new talent is especially limited in many of the geographies that are expected to be sources of growth for Novartis, particularly China and the US. In China, the US and several other markets, the geographic mobility of talent is decreasing, with ample career opportunities available closer to home for tal - ented individuals, who often have increasing expecta - tions that they may choose where they work. The risks associated with drawing from the external supply of talent will be exacerbated if we are unable to retain and effectively develop our key personnel and maintain a sustainable pipeline of talent and senior lead - ers with the critical skills and experiences necessary to deliver on our business priorities. As a result, our ability to retain critical talent, reward performance, incentivize our employees, pay competitive compensation and suc - cessfully implement our key personnel succession plans is essential. Our inability to integrate, engage and moti - vate employees, in particular those in leadership posi - tions, may jeopardize our succession plans and our abil - ity to achieve our business priorities. Legal, ethics and compliance Risk description Challenges in keeping up with legal and regulatory requirements, and evolving societal expectations regard - ing ethical behavior Context and potential impact We are obligated to comply with the laws of all countries in which we operate and sell products with respect to an Item 3. Key Information 16extremely wide and growing range of activities. Such legal requirements are extensive and complex. The laws and regulations relevant to the healthcare industry and applicable to us are broad in scope and are subject to change and evolving interpretations, which could require us to incur substantial costs associated with compliance or to alter one or more of our business practices. For example, we have been, are currently and may in the future be subject to various significant legal proceedings, such as private party litigation, government investigations and law enforcement actions worldwide. These types of matters may take various forms based upon evolving government enforcement and private party litigation priorities, and could include matters per - taining to pricing; bribery and corruption; trade regula - sales and market - ing practices; trading; occupational health and safety; environmental regulations; tax; cybersecurity; data privacy; regulatory interactions; and intellectual property. Such activities can involve criminal proceed - ings and can retroactively challenge practices previously considered to be legal. There is also a risk that governance for our medical and patient support activities, and our interactions with governments, public officials/institutions, healthcare professionals, healthcare organizations and patient organizations may be inadequate or fail, or that we may undertake activities based on improper or inadequate scientific justification. Our Sandoz Division may from time to time seek approval to market a generic version of a product before the expiration of patents claimed by the marketer of the patented product. We do this in cases where we believe the relevant patents are invalid or unenforceable, or would not be infringed by our generic product. As a result, affiliates of our Sandoz Division frequently face patent litigation, and in certain circumstances, we may make the business decision to market a generic product even though patent infringement actions are still pending. Should we elect to do so and conduct a so-called \"launch at risk,\" we could face substantial damages if the final court decision is adverse to us. Legal proceedings and investigations are inherently unpredictable, and large judgments sometimes occur. As a consequence, we may in the future incur judgments that could involve large payments, including the poten - tial repayment of amounts allegedly obtained improperly, and other penalties, including treble damages. In addi - tion, such legal proceedings and investigations, even if meritless, may affect our reputation, may create a risk of potential exclusion from government reimbursement programs in the US and other countries, and may lead to civil litigation. As a result, having taken into account all relevant factors, we have in the past and may again in the future enter into major settlements of such claims without bringing them to final legal adjudication by courts or other such bodies, despite having potentially signifi - cant defenses against them, in order to limit the risks they pose to our business and reputation. Such settle - ments may require us to pay significant sums of money and to enter into corporate integrity or similar agree -ments, which are intended to regulate company behav - ior for extended periods. For information on significant legal matters pending against us, see \"Item 18. Financial Statements\u2014Note 20. Provisions and other non -current liabilities\" and \"Item 18. Financial Statements\u2014Note 28. Commitments and con - tingencies.\" New requirements may also be imposed on us as a result of changing government and societal expectations regarding the healthcare industry, and acceptable cor - porate behavior generally. For example, we are faced with laws and regulations requiring changes in how we do business, including with respect to disclosures con - cerning our interactions with healthcare professionals, healthcare organizations and patient organizations. These laws and regulations include requirements that we disclose payments or other transfers of value made to healthcare professionals and organizations, as well as information relating to the costs and prices for our prod - ucts, which represent evolving standards of acceptable corporate behavior. These requirements may incur sig - nificant costs, including substantial time and additional resources, that are necessary to bring our interactions with healthcare professionals and organizations into compliance with these evolving standards. In addition to legal and regulatory requirements, as a company we aim to meet the evolving societal expecta - tions of the public and our investors regarding ethical behavior and the increasing importance placed on ESG matters. To help us in our efforts to comply with the many requirements that impact us, we have a significant global ethics and compliance program in place, and we devote substantial time and resources to efforts to ensure that our business is conducted in a lawful and publicly accept - able manner. Despite our efforts, an actual or alleged failure to comply with law or with heightened public expectations could lead to substantial liabilities that may not be covered by insurance, or to other significant losses. Data privacy Risk description Noncompliance with personal data protection laws and regulations Context and potential impact We operate in an environment that relies on the collec - tion, processing, analysis and interpretation of large sets of patients' and other individuals' personal information, including via social media and mobile technologies. Also, the operation of our business requires data to flow freely across borders of numerous countries in which there are different, and potentially conflicting, frequently changing data privacy laws in effect. For example, the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which took effect in May 2018; the California Consumer Privacy Act, which took effect in January 2020; Brazil's General Personal Data Protection Law, which entered into force in Sep - tember 2020; and the Personal Information Protection Law in China, which took effect in November 2021, impose stringent requirements on how we and third par - ties with whom we contract collect, share, export or oth -Item 3. Key Information 17erwise process personal information, and provide for sig - nificant penalties for noncompliance. Breaches of our systems or those of our third-party contractors, or other failures to protect the data we collect from misuse or breach by third parties, could expose such personal information to unauthorized persons. Any event involving the substantial loss of personal information, use of personal information without a legal basis, or other privacy violations could give rise to sig - nificant liability, reputational harm, damaged relation - ships with business partners, and potentially substantial monetary penalties under laws enacted or being enacted around the world. Such events could also lead to restric - tions on our ability to use personal information and/or transfer personal information across country borders. In addition, there is a trend of increasing divergence of data privacy legal frameworks, not only across these frame - works but also within individual legal frameworks them - selves. This divergence may constrain the implementa - tion of global business processes and may lead to different approaches on the use of health data for sci - entific research, which may have a negative impact on our business and operations. Supply chain Risk description Inability to maintain continuity of product supply Context and potential impact Many of our products are produced using technically complex manufacturing processes and require a supply of highly specialized raw materials. For some of our prod - ucts and raw materials, we may rely on a single source of supply. In addition, we manufacture and sell a number of sterile products, biologic products, and products involving advanced therapy platforms, such as CAR-T therapies, gene therapies and radioligand therapy prod - ucts, all of which are particularly complex and involve highly specialized manufacturing technologies. Because the production process for some of our products is com - plex, there is a risk of production failures, which may result in supply interruptions or product recalls due to defective products being distributed to the market. In addition, due to the inherent complexities of our production processes, we are required to plan our pro - duction activities well in advance. If we suffer from third- party raw material shortages, underestimate market demand for a product, or fail to accurately predict when a new product will be approved for sale, then we may not be able to produce sufficient product to meet demand. These issues could be made worse during a pandemic like the COVID-19 pandemic, and could lead to (i) a sud - den increase in demand for selected medicinal products, resulting in the short-term unavailability of raw material; (ii) logistical and supply challenges that may lead to our inability to ship products from one place to another due to restrictions imposed as a result of a pandemic, which can impact transportation and warehousing costs; or (iii) our inability to properly operate a production site due to restrictions imposed as the result of a pandemic. Our or our third-party suppliers' inability to manage such issues could lead to shutdowns, to product short - ages, or to our being entirely unable to supply products to patients for an extended period of time. Further, because our products are intended to promote the health of patients, such shortages or shutdowns could endan - ger our reputation and have led to, and could continue to lead to, significant losses of sales revenue, potential litigation or allegations that the public health, or the health of individuals, has been harmed. Falsified medicines Risk description Impact on patient safety, and reputational and financial harm to Novartis and our products Context and potential impact We continue to be challenged by the vulnerability of dis - tribution channels to falsified medicines, which include counterfeit, stolen, tampered and illegally diverted medicines under the definition of the World Health Orga - nization. The COVID-19 pandemic has substantially increased the presence of falsified medicines in the mar - kets affected and on the internet. Falsified medicines pose patient safety risks and can be seriously harmful or life-threatening. Reports of adverse events related to falsified medicines and increased levels of falsified medicines in the healthcare system affect patient confi - dence in our genuine medicines and in healthcare sys - tems in general. These events could also cause us sub - stantial reputational and financial harm, and potentially lead to litigation if the adverse event from the falsified medicine is mistakenly attributed to the genuine one. Sto - len or illegally diverted medicines, which are then not properly stored and are later sold through unauthorized channels, could adversely impact patient safety, our rep - utation and our business. Further, there is a direct finan - cial loss when, for example, falsified medicines replace sales of genuine medicines, or genuine medicines are recalled following discovery of falsified products. Emerging risks Geo-political and socio-economic threats Risk description Impact of geo- and socio-political threats and macro - economic developments Context and potential impact Unpredictable political conditions currently exist in var - ious parts of the world, including a backlash in certain areas against free trade; anti -immigrant sentiment; anti-corporatist sentiment; social unrest; fears of terror - ism; risk of direct conflicts between nations; a global pan - demic; and economic downturn. The imposition of tariffs, including those imposed by the US and China, and the possibility of additional tariffs or other trade restrictions relating to trade between the US and other countries, could have a material negative impact on our business. Given that the status of trade negotiations remains subject to change, we cannot be certain of the nature or extent of the potential impact on our business. For example, if tariffs on pharmaceutical products or active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) Item 3. Key Information 18were increased, this could impact the profitability of our products and disrupt our supply chain. Increasing oppo - sition to free trade may increase the risks we face in our efforts to improve and harmonize standards in regulation and intellectual property. Furthermore, significant conflicts continue in certain parts of the world. Collectively, such unstable conditions could, among other things, disturb the international flow of goods and increase the costs and difficulties of inter - national transactions, which could significantly impact time to market and our ability to supply our products to patients in an undisrupted fashion, and further erode reimbursement levels for innovative therapies. In addition, local economic conditions may adversely affect the ability of payers, as well as our distributors, customers, suppliers and service providers, to pay for our products, or otherwise to buy necessary inventory or raw materials, and to perform their obligations under agreements with us. Although we make efforts to moni - tor these third parties' financial condition and their liquid - ity, our ability to do so is limited, and some of them may become unable to pay their bills in a timely manner or may even become insolvent. These risks may be elevated with respect to our interactions with fiscally challenged government payers, or with third parties with substantial exposure to such payers. Our business may be impacted by economic and financial conditions directly affecting consumers. Given that in many countries, patients directly pay a large por - tion of their own healthcare costs, there is a risk that consumers may cut back on prescription drugs due to financial constraints. At the same time, significant changes and potential future volatility in the financial markets, in the consumer and business environment, in the competitive landscape, and in the global political and security landscape make it increasingly difficult for us to predict our revenues and earnings. As a result, any revenue or earnings guidance or outlook that we have given or might give may be over - taken by events, or may otherwise turn out to be inaccu - rate. Though we endeavor to give reasonable estimates of future revenues and earnings at the time we give such guidance, based on then -current knowledge and condi - tions, there is a risk that such guidance or outlook will turn out to be incorrect. Financial market issues may also result in a lower return on our financial investments, and a lower value on some of our assets. Alternatively, inflation could accel - erate, which could lead to higher interest rates, increas - ing our costs of raising capital. Uncertainties around future central bank and other economic policies in the US and EU, as well as high debt levels in certain other countries, could also impact world trade. Sudden increases in economic, currency or financial market vol - atility in different countries have also impacted, and may continue to unpredictably impact, our business or results of operations, including the conversion of our operating results into our reporting currency, the US dollar, as well as the value of our investments in our pension plans.

Financial instruments - additional disclosures.\" T ax laws and developments Risk description Changes in tax laws or their application Context and potential impact Our multinational operations are taxed under the laws of the countries and other jurisdictions in which we oper - ate. Changes in tax laws or in their application could lead to an increased risk of international tax disputes and an increase in our effective tax rate, which could adversely affect our financial results. The integrated nature of our worldwide operations can produce conflicting claims from revenue authorities in different countries as to the profits to be taxed in the individual countries, including potential disputes relating to the prices our subsidiaries charge one another for intercompany transactions, known as transfer pricing. Most of the jurisdictions in which we operate have double tax treaties with other foreign jurisdictions, which provide a framework for mit - igating the impact of double taxation on our revenues and capital gains. However, mechanisms developed to resolve such conflicting claims are largely untried and can be expected to be very lengthy. Accruals for tax con - tingencies are made based on experience, interpreta - tions of tax law, and judgments about potential actions by tax authorities. However, due to the complexity of tax contingencies, the ultimate resolution of any tax matter may result in payments materially different from the amounts accrued. In 2019, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) launched a new initiative on behalf of the G20 to minimize profit shifting by working toward a global tax framework that ensures that corpo - rate income taxes are paid where consumption takes place and also introduces a global standard on minimum taxation combined with new tax dispute resolution pro - cesses. This project achieved OECD political consensus in October 2021, and the detailed principles are still under discussion. The OECD expects that the implemen - tation of these new principles will begin globally in 2023. The EU also adopted a new Directive on Administrative Cooperation (DAC6) in 2018, which seeks additional reporting as of July 2020. During 2021, all EU member states implemented this EU directive as part of their respective local laws and regulations. In 2020, the EU announced it will introduce new centralized taxation powers to address the financial impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, which has not yet occurred. In addition, the European Commission continues to extend the applica - tion of its policies seeking to limit fiscal aid by member states to particular companies, and the related investi - gation of the member states' practices regarding the Item 3. Key Information 19issuance of rulings on tax matters relating to individual companies. Although we have taken steps to comply with evolv - ing initiatives like that of the OECD and the EU, and will continue to do so, significant uncertainties remain as to the outcome of our efforts. For more information, see \"Item 18. Financial State - ments\u2014Note 6. Income taxes\" and \"Item 18. Financial Statements\u2014Note 12. Deferred tax assets and liabilities.\" General risks Indebtedness Risk description Our indebtedness could adversely affect our operations Context and potential impact As of December 31, 2021, we had USD 22.9 billion of non-current financial debt, and USD 6.3 billion of current financial debt. Our current and long -term debt requires us to dedicate a portion of our cash flow to service inter - est and principal payments and, if interest rates rise, this amount may increase. As a result, our existing debt may limit our ability to use our cash flow to fund capital expen - ditures, to engage in transactions, or to meet other cap - ital needs, or otherwise may place us at a competitive disadvantage relative to competitors that have less debt. Our debt could also limit our flexibility to plan for and react to changes in our business or industry, and increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and indus - try conditions, including changes in interest rates or a downturn in our business or the economy. We may also have difficulty refinancing our existing debt or incurring new debt on terms that we would consider to be com - mercially reasonable, if at all. Goodwill and intangible assets Risk description Goodwill and intangible assets resulting in significant impairment charges Context and potential impact We carry a significant amount of goodwill and other intangible assets on our consolidated balance sheet, including, in particular, substantial goodwill and other intangible assets obtained through acquisitions, includ - ing most recently through our acquisitions of The Medicines Company, Xiidra , Endocyte, Novartis Gene Therapies, AAA, and certain oncology products from GSK. As a result, we may incur significant impairment charges in the future if the fair value of the intangible assets and the groupings of cash-generating units con - taining goodwill would be less than their carrying value on the Group's consolidated balance sheet at any point in time. We regularly review our intangible and tangible assets for impairment, including identifiable intangible assets and goodwill. Any significant impairment charges could have a material adverse effect on our results of opera - tions and financial condition. In 2021, for example, we recorded intangible asset impairment charges of USD 403 million. For a detailed discussion of how we determine whether an impairment has occurred, what factors could result in an impairment, and the impact of impairment charges on our results of operations, see Item 18. Finan - cial Statements\u2014Note 1. Significant accounting policies\" and \"Item 18. Financial Statements\u2014Note 11. Goodwill and intangible assets.\" Foreign currency exchange rates Risk description Negative effect on financial results due to foreign cur - rency exchange rate fluctuations Context and potential impact Changes in exchange rates between the US dollar, our reporting currency, and other currencies can result in significant increases or decreases in our reported sales, costs and earnings as expressed in US dollars, and in the reported value of our assets, liabilities and cash flows. In addition to ordinary market risk, there is a risk that countries could take affirmative steps that could signifi - cantly impact the value of their currencies. Such steps could include \"quantitative easing\" measures and poten - tial withdrawals by countries from common currencies. In addition, countries facing local financial difficulties, including countries experiencing high inflation rates and highly indebted countries facing large capital outflows, may impose controls on the exchange of foreign cur - rency. Currency exchange controls could limit our ability to distribute retained earnings from our local affiliates, or to pay intercompany payables due from those coun - tries. Despite measures undertaken to reduce or hedge against foreign currency exchange risks, because a sig - nificant portion of our earnings and expenditures are in currencies other than the US dollar, including expendi - tures in Swiss francs that are significantly higher than our revenue in Swiss francs, any such exchange rate vol - atility may negatively and materially impact our results of operations and financial condition, and may impact the reported value of our net sales, earnings, assets and liabilities. In addition, the timing and extent of such vola - tility can be difficult to predict. Further, depending on the movements of particular foreign exchange rates, we may be materially adversely affected at a time when the same currency movements are benefiting some of our com - petitors. For more information on the effects of currency fluc - tuations on our consolidated financial statements and on how we manage currency risk, see \"Item 5. Operat - ing and Financial Review and Prospects\u2014Item 5.B Liquid - ity and capital resources\u2014Effects of currency fluctua - tions\" and \"Item 18. Financial Statements\u2014Note 29. Financial instruments - additional disclosures.\" Key customers Risk description Ongoing consolidation among our distributors and retail - ers, and the concentration of credit riskItem 3. Key Information 20Context and potential impact Increasingly, a significant portion of our global sales is made to a relatively small number of drug wholesalers, retail chains and other purchasing organizations. For example, our three most important customers globally accounted for approximately 17%, 11% and 6%, respec - tively, of net sales in 2021. The largest trade receivables outstanding were for these three customers, amounting to 16%, 12% and 7%, respectively, of the Group's trade receivables at December 31, 2021. The trend has been toward further consolidation among distributors and retailers. As a result, we may be affected by fluctuations in the buying patterns of such customers. Furthermore, these customers are gaining additional purchasing lever - age, increasing the pricing pressures facing our busi - nesses. These pressures can particularly impact our Sandoz Division, the generic products of which can often be obtained from numerous competitors. Moreover, we are exposed to a concentration of credit risk as a result of this concentration among our customers. If one or more of our major customers experienced financial dif - ficulties, the effect on us would be substantial, and could include a substantial loss of sales and an inability to col - lect amounts owed to us. Environmental matters Risk description Impact of environmental liabilities Context and potential impact The environmental laws of various jurisdictions impose actual and potential obligations on us to investigate and remediate contaminated sites, including in connection with activities in the past by businesses that are no lon - ger part of Novartis. In some cases, these remediation efforts may take many years. While we have set aside provisions for known worldwide environmental liabilities that are probable and estimable, there is no guarantee that additional costs will not be incurred beyond the amounts for which we have provided in the Group con - solidated financial statements. If environmental contam - ination resulting from our facility operations, business activities or products adversely impacts third parties or if we fail to properly manage the safety of our facilities, including the safety of our employees and contractors, and the environmental risks, we may face substantial one-time and recurring costs and other penalties, and be required to increase our provisions for environmen - tal liabilities. See also \"Item 4. Information on the Company\u2014Item 4.D Property, plants and equipment\" and \"Item 18. Finan - cial Statements\u2014Note 20. Provisions and other non -cur- rent liabilities.\" Climate change Risk description Climate change and increased risk of major natural disas - ters Context and potential impact Novartis is exposed to climate risks such as physical risks (e.g., heat, water scarcity, sea level rise, flooding from severe weather events) and transition risks (e.g., regulatory frameworks, carbon pricing, cost of and access to capital), which could vary in magnitude and impact country by country. For example, some of our production facilities that depend on the availability of significant water supplies are located in areas where water is increasingly scarce. Other facilities are located in places that, because of increasingly violent weather events, sea level rise, or both, are increasingly at risk of substantial flooding. In regions where this risk is present, it impacts not only our own operations but also our distributed supply chain. Such events may result in increased costs, business interruptions, destruction of facilities, loss of life, and dis - ruption to healthcare systems that patients use to access our medicines. Climate change may trigger the adoption of new reg - ulatory requirements across the globe. Such legislation could include increased requirements to invest in tech - nology to reduce energy use, water use and greenhouse gas emissions, beyond what we expect to invest in our existing plans. In addition, legislation could include car - bon pricing, climate risk disclosure mandates, and changes in zoning or building codes to increase climate resilience. The combined impact of these transition risks could increase our direct operating costs and result in the same impact across our supply chain. As a result of these transition risks, we are committed to becoming carbon neutral in our own operations by 2025, and car - bon neutral across our value chain by 2030. In addition, we are committed to achieving net zero across our value chain by 2040. Any failure to achieve these commitments in the expected time frame, or at all, could result in neg - ative impacts to our reputation, our operations, and the price of our shares. Furthermore, our corporate headquarters, the head - quarters of our Innovative Medicines and Sandoz Divi - sions, and certain of our major Innovative Medicines Divi - sion production and research facilities are located near earthquake fault lines in Basel, Switzerland. Other major facilities are located near major earthquake fault lines in various locations around the world. In the event of a major earthquake, we could experience business interruptions, destruction of facilities, and loss of life. Pension plans Risk description Inaccuracies in the assumptions and estimates used to calculate our pension plan and other post-employment obligations Context and potential impact We sponsor pension and other post-employment bene - fit plans in various forms that cover a significant portion of our current and former employees. For post-employ- ment plans with defined benefit obligations, we are required to make significant assumptions and estimates about future events in calculating the expense and the present value of the liability related to these plans. These include assumptions about the discount rates we apply to estimate future defined benefit obligations and net periodic pension expense, as well as rates of future pen - sion increases. In addition, our actuarial consultants pro -Item 3. Key Information 21vide our management with historical statistical informa - tion, such as withdrawal and mortality rates in connection with these estimates. Assumptions and estimates we use may differ mate - rially from the actual results we experience due to chang - ing market and economic conditions, higher or lower withdrawal rates, and longer or shorter life spans of par - ticipants, among other factors. Depending on events, such differences could have a material effect on our total equity and may require us to make additional contribu - tions to our pension funds.

Innovative Medicines Overview Our Innovative Medicines Division is a world leader in offering patent -protected medicines to patients and phy- sicians. The Innovative Medicines Division researches, develops, manufactures, distributes and sells patented pharmaceuticals, and is composed of two global business units: Novartis Oncology and Novartis Pharmaceuticals. The Novartis Oncology business unit is responsible for the commercialization of products in the areas of can - cer and hematologic disorders, and consists of the global business franchises Hematology and Solid Tumor. The Novartis Pharmaceuticals business unit is organized into the following global business franchises responsible for the commercialization of various products in their respec - tive therapeutic lar, Renal and Metabolism; Respiratory and Allergy; and Established Medicines. The Innovative Medicines Division is the larger of our two divisions in terms of consolidated net sales. It reported consolidated net sales of USD 42.0 billion in 2021, which represented 81.3% of the Group's net sales. The product portfolio of the Innovative Medicines Division includes a significant number of key marketed products, many of which are among the leaders in their respective therapeutic areas. Innovative Medicines Division products The following summaries describe certain key marketed products in our Innovative Medicines Division, listed according to year-end net sales within each franchise. While we typically seek to sell our marketed products throughout the world, not all products and indications are available in every country. Therefore, the indications described in these summaries may vary by country. In addition, a product may be available under different brand names depending on country and indication. Some of the products described below have lost patent pro - tection or are otherwise subject to generic competition. Others are subject to patent challenges by potential generic competitors.

Compounds in development The following table provides an overview of the key Innovative Medicines Division projects currently in the Confirmatory Development stage and may also describe certain projects in the Exploratory Development stage. Projects typically enter Confirmatory Development and become the responsibility of our Global Drug Develop - ment organization during Phase II testing. (For more information about our drug development program, see \"\u2014Research and development\u2014Development program.\") Projects are listed in alphabetical order by compound code, or by product name where applicable. Projects include those seeking to develop potential uses of new molecular entities as well as potential additional indica - tions or new formulations for already marketed products. The table below, entitled \"Projects removed from the development table since 2020,\" highlights changes to the table entitled \"Selected development projects\" from the previous year. The year that each project entered the current phase of development refers to the year of the first patient's first visit in the first clinical trial of that phase. For proj - ects in Phase II, the year refers to the first patient's first visit in the first Phase II trial, which can happen before the Confirmatory Development stage. Prior to 2020, we reported the current phase based on the year in which the decision to enter the phase was made. To maintain continuity, we have included certain previously disclosed projects, noted below, that have not yet achieved \"first patient, first visit\" in any Phase I-III study for the reported indication and route of administration. We have disclosed these projects using our previous reporting criteria. A reference to a project being in registration means that an application has been submitted to a health author - ity for marketing approval. Compounds and new indica - tions in development are subject to required regulatory approvals and, in certain instances, contractual limita - tions. These compounds and indications are in various stages of development throughout the world. It may not be possible to obtain regulatory approval for any or all of the new compounds and new indications referred to in this Form 20 -F in any country or in every country.

Information on the Company 32Principal markets The Innovative Medicines Division sells products in approximately 140 countries worldwide. Net sales are primar - ily concentrated in the US and Europe. The following table sets forth the aggregate 2021 net sales of the Innovative Medicines Division by region: Innovative Medicines 2021 net sales to third parties USD millions % United States 14999 36 Europe 14919 36 Asia, Africa, Australasia 9304 22 Canada and Latin America 2773 6 Total 41995 100 Of which in Established Markets 1 31459 75 Of which in Emerging Growth Markets 1 10536 25 1 Emerging Growth Markets comprise all markets other than the Established Markets of the US, Canada, Western Europe, Japan, Australia and New Zealand. Many of our Innovative Medicines Division products are used for chronic conditions that require patients to con - sume the product over long periods of time, ranging from months to years. However, certain of our marketed prod - ucts and development projects, such as cell and gene therapies, are administered only once. Net sales of the vast majority of our products are not subject to material changes in seasonal demand. Production Our primary goal is to ensure the uninterrupted, timely and cost -effective supply of products that meet all prod - uct specifications and quality standards. The manufac - turing of our products is highly regulated by governmen - tal health authorities around the world, including the FDA and EMA. In addition to regulatory requirements, many of our products involve technically complex manufactur - ing processes or require highly specialized raw materi - als. In 2021, we integrated Novartis Gene Therapies into our existing manufacturing and supply structure, created a new ophthalmology supply unit, and launched a con - tract manufacturing organization in biotechnology and cell and gene therapy services. We manufacture our products across the following platforms at facilities worldwide: large molecules, small molecules, Sandoz Technical Operations, cell and gene therapy, and oph - thalmology and local market manufacturing (see also \"\u2014Item 4.D Property, plants and equipment\"). In our manu - facturing network, we maintain state -of-the-art processes, with quality as a priority, and require our sup - pliers to adhere to the same high standards we expect from our own people and processes. Those processes include chemical and biological syntheses; sterile pro - cessing, including CAR-T cell processing; and formula - tion and packaging. We are constantly working to improve our existing manufacturing processes, to develop new and innovative technologies, and to review and adapt our manufacturing network to meet our needs and those of our patients and customers. We produce raw materials for manufacturing in -house or we purchase them from a number of third-party sup - pliers. Where possible, we maintain multiple supply sources so that the business is not dependent on a sin -gle or limited number of suppliers. However, our ability to do so may at times be limited by regulatory or other requirements. We monitor market developments that could have an adverse effect on the supply of essential materials. Our suppliers of raw materials are required to comply with applicable regulations and Novartis quality standards. Because the manufacturing of our products is com - plex and highly regulated by governmental health author - ities, supply is never guaranteed. If we or our third-party suppliers fail to comply with applicable regulations, then there could be a product recall or other disruption to our production activities. We have experienced supply inter - ruptions for our products in the past, and there can be no assurance that supply will not be interrupted again in the future. However, we have implemented a global man - ufacturing strategy to maximize business continuity in case of such events. Marketing and sales The Innovative Medicines Division serves customers with 23 243 field force representatives, as of December 31, 2021, including supervisors and administrative person - nel. These trained representatives present the therapeu - tic benefits and risks of our products to physicians, phar - macists, hospitals, insurance groups, managed care organizations and other healthcare professionals. In the US, Novartis advertises certain products via digital and traditional media channels, including the internet, televi - sion, newspapers and magazines. Novartis also pursues co-promotion/co -marketing opportunities as well as licensing and distribution agreements with other com - panies in various markets. Item 4. Information on the Company 33The marketplace for healthcare is evolving: Customer groups beyond prescribers have increasing influence on treatment decisions and guidelines, while patients con - tinue to become more informed stakeholders in their healthcare decisions and look for solutions to meet their changing needs. Novartis is responding by adapting our business practices to engage appropriately with patients, customer groups and other stakeholders, including by delivering innovative solutions to drive education, access and improved patient care. The COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated additional changes related to marketing and sales techniques in the healthcare industry. For example, many healthcare professionals have increased their use of virtual plat - forms when interacting with pharmaceutical companies, and prefer to receive information in a more convenient and personalized way. In response, Novartis is working to implement a new customer engagement model that combines traditional face-to-face visits with digital meth - ods of engaging healthcare professionals. We are simi - larly changing our approach to engaging healthcare sys - tems, payers and other healthcare providers. Although specific distribution patterns vary by coun - try, Novartis generally sells its prescription drugs primar - ily to wholesale and retail drug distributors, hospitals, clinics, government agencies and managed healthcare providers. The growing number of so -called \"specialty\" drugs in our portfolio has resulted in increased engage - ment with specialty pharmacies. In the US, specialty pharmacies continue to grow as a distribution channel for specialty products. Most specialty drugs can only be dispensed through specialty pharmacies that are wholly owned by national pharmacy benefit managers. In the US, the US Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) is the largest single payer for healthcare services as a result of continuing changes in healthcare economics and an aging population. In addition, both commercial and government-sponsored managed care organizations continue to be among the largest groups of payers for healthcare services in the US. In other coun - tries, national health services are often the only signifi - cant payer for healthcare services. In an effort to control prescription drug costs, almost all managed care orga - nizations and national health services use formularies that list specific drugs that may be reimbursed and/or the level of reimbursement for each drug. Managed care organizations and national health services also increas - ingly use cost -benefit analyses to determine whether or not newly approved drugs will be added to a formulary and/or the level of reimbursement for that drug, and to determine whether or not to continue to reimburse exist - ing drugs. We have dedicated teams that actively seek to optimize patient access, including formulary positions, for our products. The trend toward consolidation among distributors and retailers of Innovative Medicines Division products continues in the US and internationally, both within coun - try and across countries. This has increased our cus - tomers' purchasing leverage and resulted in increased pricing pressure on our products. Moreover, we are exposed to increased concentration of credit risk as a result of the consolidation among our customers. Drug pricing is an increasingly prominent issue in many countries as healthcare spending continues to rise. This issue has received significant attention in the US (please see \"\u2014Price controls\" for further information). At Novartis, we are increasing our efforts to enable patient access through innovative pricing and access initiatives in the US, Europe and other markets. These include con - tract structures such as pay-over-time and out - come-based agreements. In 2021, Novartis reached an agreement with the National Health Service (NHS) in England to implement a first-of-its-kind population health management approach designed to provide faster and broader access to Leqvio for certain high-risk patients with atheroscle - rotic cardiovascular disease. Novartis is exploring simi - lar collaborations in other countries. Additionally, following conditional approval of Zolgensma in Europe in 2020, Novartis Gene Therapies established \"Day One\" early access agreements in mul - tiple European countries. These agreements support early patient access by allowing a variety of customiz - able options, including retroactive rebates, deferred pay - ments, installment options, outcome-based rebates, and collaborations with healthcare systems to optimize dis - ease management. These efforts have expanded glob - ally, and we now have multiple early access agreements and pay-for-performance agreements (i.e., out - come-based arrangements) in place in various markets around the world. Zolgensma is approved in over 40 countries. Novartis has established an outcome-based frame - work in the US for one of the approved indications of our oncology product Kymriah , whereby the product invoice is linked to a successful outcome for each patient at an agreed milestone. Novartis also offers outcome-based agreements for approved indications of Kymriah and Luxturna in certain countries other than the US. These typically involve a full upfront payment of the product with a partial refund in case of failed outcomes, or install - ment payments based on successful patient outcomes at agreed milestones. Competition The global pharmaceutical market is highly competitive. We compete against other major international corpora - tions that have substantial financial and other resources, as well as against smaller companies that operate region - ally or nationally. Competition within the industry is intense and extends across a wide range of activities, including pricing, product characteristics, customer ser - vice, sales and marketing, and research and develop - ment. Like other companies selling patented pharma - ceuticals, Novartis faces challenges from companies selling competing patented products. Generic forms of our products may follow the expiry of intellectual prop - erty protection, and generic companies may also gain entry to the market through successfully challenging our intellectual property rights. We use legally permissible measures to defend those rights. See also \"\u2014Intellectual property\" below. We also may face competition from over-the-counter (OTC) products that do not require a prescription from a physician. Item 4. Information on the Company 34There is ongoing consolidation in the pharmaceuti - cal industry. At the same time, new entrants are looking to use their expertise to establish or expand their pres - ence in healthcare, including technology companies seeking to benefit from the increasing importance of data and data management in our industry. Research and development The discovery and development of a new drug usually requires approximately 10 to 15 years from the initial research to bringing a drug to market. This includes approximately six to eight years from Phase I clinical tri - als to market entry. At each of these steps, there is a substantial risk that a compound (i.e., drug or biologic) or other therapeutic candidate will not meet the require - ments to progress further. In such an event, we may be required to abandon the development of a potential ther - apy in which we have made a substantial investment. We manage our research and development expendi - tures across our entire portfolio in accordance with our strategic priorities. We make decisions about whether or not to proceed with development projects on a proj - ect-by-project basis. These decisions are based on the project's potential to meet a significant unmet medical need or to improve patient outcomes, the strength of the science underlying the project, and the potential of the project (subject to the risks inherent in pharmaceutical development) to generate significant positive financial results for the Company. Once a management decision has been made to proceed with the development of a particular molecule, the level of research and develop - ment investment required will be driven by many factors. These include the medical indications for which it is being developed, the number of indications being pursued, whether the molecule is of a chemical or biological nature, the stage of development, and the level of evi - dence necessary to demonstrate clinical efficacy and safety. Research program Our research program is conducted by the Novartis Insti - tutes for BioMedical Research (NIBR), which is the research and early development innovation engine of Novartis. NIBR is responsible for the discovery of new medicines for diseases with unmet medical need. We focus our work in areas where we believe we can have the most impact for patients. This requires the hiring and retention of highly talented employees, a focus on fun - damental disease mechanisms that are relevant across different disease areas, continuous improvement in tech - nologies for drug discovery and potential therapies, close alliances with clinical colleagues, and the estab - lishment of strategic external alliances. Approximately 5 200 full -time-equivalent scientists, physicians and business professionals work at NIBR sites in Basel, Switzerland; Cambridge, Massachusetts; East Hanover, New Jersey; San Diego, California; Emeryville, California; and Shanghai, China. They con - tribute to research into disease areas such as cardiovas - cular, respiratory and allergic diseases. Research at the Friedrich Miescher Institute and the Genomics Institute of the Novartis Research Foundation focuses on basic genetic and genomic research, and the Novartis Institute for Tropical Diseases (NITD), in Emeryville, California, focuses on discovering new medicines to fight tropical diseases, including malaria and cryptosporidiosis. All drug candidates go through proof -of-concept tri - als to enable an early assessment of the safety and effi - cacy of the drug while collecting basic information on pharmacokinetics and tolerability, and adhering to the guidance for early clinical testing set forth by health authorities. Following proof of concept, our Global Drug Development unit conducts confirmatory trials on the drug candidates. In 2020, we discontinued early discovery research at NIBR's Shanghai site and focused our research and development activities there on expanding the scale and scope of our early clinical development and later-stage clinical trial operations to help accelerate the develop - ment of new medicines. In response to the current pandemic, we are pursu - ing potential therapeutic strategies to help combat COVID-19. Chief among these are our efforts to discover a novel therapy targeting the main protease - an enzyme essential to the replication of many coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2 - and our collaboration with Molecular Partners to develop ensovibep, a potential new treatment option for COVID-19 that targets the virus using proprietary DARPin technology to neutralize SARS-CoV-2. The topline results of a Phase II study reported in early 2022 showed that a single intravenous dose of ensovibep reduced viral load through Day Eight, shortened symptom duration, reduced emergency room visits and/or hospitalizations related to COVID-19, and reduced deaths, compared to placebo. In separate stud - ies, it maintained potent in-vitro pan-variant activity against all variants of concern identified so far, including Omicron. Development program Our Global Drug Development (GDD) organization over - sees drug development activities for our Innovative Medicines Division. GDD works collaboratively with NIBR to execute our overall pipeline strategy. The GDD orga - nization includes centralized global functions such as Regulatory Affairs and Global Development Operations, and global Development Units aligned with our business franchises. GDD was created to improve resource allo - cation, technology implementation and process stan - dardization to further increase innovation. GDD includes approximately 12 400 full -time equivalent employees worldwide. The traditional model of clinical development consists of three phases: Phase I: The first clinical trials of a new compound - generally performed in a small number of healthy human volunteers - to assess the drug's safety profile, includ - ing the safe dosage range. These trials also determine how a drug is absorbed, distributed, metabolized and excreted, and the duration of its action.Phase II: Clinical studies performed with patients who have the target disease, with the aim of continuing the Item 4. Information on the Company 35Phase I safety assessment in a larger group, assessing the efficacy of the drug in the patient population, and determining the appropriate doses for further evaluation. Phase III: Large -scale clinical studies with several hun - dred to several thousand patients, which are conducted to establish the safety and efficacy of the drug in spe - cific indications for regulatory approval. Phase III trials may also be used to compare a new drug against a cur - rent standard of care to evaluate the overall benefit -risk relationship of the new medicine. In each of these phases, physicians monitor volunteer patients closely to assess the safety and efficacy of a potential new drug or indication. Though we use this traditional model, we have tai - lored the development process to be simpler, more flex - ible and efficient. We divide the development process into two stages: Exploratory Development to establish proof of concept, followed by Confirmatory Development to confirm the concept in large numbers of patients. Exploratory Development consists of clinical proof-of- concept (PoC) studies, which are small clinical trials (typ - ically involving between five and 15 patients) that com - bine elements of traditional Phase I/II testing. NIBR conducts these customized trials, which are designed to give early insights into issues such as safety, efficacy and toxicity for a drug in a given indication. Once a pos - itive proof of concept has been established, the drug moves to the Confirmatory Development stage and becomes the responsibility of GDD. Confirmatory Devel - opment has elements of traditional Phase II/III testing and includes trials aimed at confirming the safety and efficacy of the drug in the given indication, leading up to submission of a dossier to health authorities for approval. This stage can also include trials that compare the drug to the current standard of care for the disease in order to evaluate the drug's overall benefit-risk profile. Further, with new treatment approaches such as gene therapy for rare diseases, elements of Exploratory and Confir - matory Development may be combined and suffice for registration under certain conditions such as high unmet medical need and clinical data showing highly favorable benefit-risk. In these cases, additional post-approval studies may be required by the regulatory authorities to continue to gather important data to further support approval. The vast amount of data that must be collected and evaluated makes clinical testing the most time -consum - ing and expensive part of new drug development. The next stage in the drug development process is to seek registration for the new drug. For more information, see \"\u2014Regulation.\" Our Innovation Management Board (IMB) manages our activities at each phase of clinical development. The IMB is responsible for all major aspects of our develop - ment portfolio and oversees our drug development bud - get as well as major project phase transitions and mile - stones following a positive proof-of-concept outcome, including transitions to Confirmatory Development and the decision to submit a regulatory application to the health authorities. The IMB is also responsible for the endorsement of overall development strategy, the endorsement of development project priorities, and deci - sions on project discontinuations. Our Chief Executive Officer chairs the IMB, and other representatives from Novartis senior management, with expertise spanning multiple fields, are among its core and extended mem - bership. Alliances and acquisitions Our Innovative Medicines Division enters into business development agreements with other pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies and with academic and other institutions to develop new products and access new markets. We license products that complement our cur - rent product line and are appropriate to our business strategy. We focus on strategic alliances and acquisition activities for key disease areas and indications that we expect to be growth drivers in the future. We review prod - ucts and compounds we are considering licensing, using the same criteria that we use for our own internally dis - covered drugs. In December 2021, Novartis announced the signing of an option, collaboration and license agreement with an affiliate of BeiGene, Ltd. for ociperlimab, a late-stage TIGIT inhibitor that may be active against a wide range of solid tumors. This partnership strengthens the Com - pany's immunotherapy pipeline and expands develop - ment opportunities with the PD-1 inhibitor tislelizumab. Novartis announced in February 2021 that it closed the in-licensing of tislelizumab from an affiliate of BeiGene, Ltd. for North America, Europe and Japan. Novartis is advancing tislelizumab as a potential bridge to synergis - tic drug combinations, with the goal of extending survival for more patients across tumors and lines of therapy. For information about recent business acquisitions, see \"Item 18. Financial Statements\u2014Note 2. Significant trans - actions.\" Regulation The international pharmaceutical industry is highly reg - ulated. Regulatory authorities around the world admin - ister numerous laws and regulations regarding the test - ing, approval, manufacturing, importing, labeling and marketing of drugs, and review the safety and efficacy of pharmaceutical products. Extensive controls exist on the non -clinical and clinical development of pharmaceu - tical products. These regulatory requirements, and the implementation of them by local health authorities around the globe, are a major factor in determining whether a substance can be developed into a marketable product, and the amount of time and expense associated with that development. Health authorities, including those in the US and the EU, have high standards of technical evaluation. The introduction of new pharmaceutical products generally entails a lengthy approval process. Products must be authorized or registered prior to marketing, and such authorization or registration must subsequently be main - tained. In recent years, the registration process has required increased testing and documentation for the approval of new drugs, with a corresponding increase in the expense of product introduction. To register a pharmaceutical product, a registration dossier containing evidence establishing the safety, effi -Item 4. Information on the Company 36cacy and quality of the product must be submitted to regulatory authorities. Generally, a therapeutic product must be registered in each country in which it will be sold. In every country, the submission of an application to a regulatory authority does not guarantee that approval to market the product will be granted. Although the criteria for the registration of therapeutic drugs are similar in most countries, the formal structure of the necessary registration documents and the specific requirements, including risk tolerance, of the local health authorities can vary significantly from country to country. Even if a drug is registered and marketed in one country, the reg - istration authority in another country may request addi - tional information from the pharmaceutical company prior to registration or even reject the product. A drug may be approved for different indications in different countries. The registration process generally takes between six months and several years, depending on the country, the quality of the data submitted, the efficiency of the regis - tration authority's procedures, and the nature of the product. Many countries provide for accelerated pro - cessing of registration applications for innovative prod - ucts of particular therapeutic interest. In recent years, the US and the EU have made efforts to harmonize reg - istration requirements in order to achieve shorter devel - opment and registration times for medical products. However, the requirement in many countries to negoti - ate selling prices or reimbursement levels with govern - ment regulators and other payers can substantially extend the time until a product may finally be available to patients. The following provides a summary of the regulatory processes in the principal markets served by Innovative Medicines Division affiliates: United States In the US, applications for drug registration are submit - ted to and reviewed by the FDA. The FDA regulates the testing, manufacturing, labeling and approval for market - ing of pharmaceutical products intended for commer - cialization in the US. The FDA continues to monitor the safety of pharmaceutical products after they have been approved for sale in the US market. The pharmaceutical development and registration process is typically inten - sive, lengthy and rigorous. When a pharmaceutical com - pany has gathered data that it believes sufficiently demonstrates a drug's safety, efficacy and quality, then the company may file a New Drug Application (NDA) or Biologics License Application (BLA), as applicable, for the compound. The NDA or BLA must contain all the sci - entific information that has been gathered about the compound. This typically includes information regarding the clinical experiences of patients tested in the drug's clinical trials. A Supplemental New Drug Application (sNDA) or Supplemental Biologics License Application (sBLA) must be filed for new indications for a previously approved drug. Once an application is submitted, the FDA assigns reviewers from its staff, including experts in biopharma - ceutics, chemistry, clinical microbiology, pharmacology/toxicology, and statistics. After a complete review, these content experts provide written evaluations of the NDA or BLA. These recommendations are consolidated and are used by senior FDA staff in its final evaluation of the NDA or BLA. Based on that final evaluation, the FDA then provides to the NDA or BLA's sponsor an approval, or a \"complete response\" letter if the NDA or BLA applica - tion is not approved. If not approved, the letter will state the specific deficiencies in the NDA or BLA that need to be addressed. The sponsor must then submit an ade - quate response to the deficiencies in order to restart the review procedure. Once the FDA has approved an NDA, BLA, sNDA or sBLA, the company can make the new drug available for physicians and other healthcare providers to prescribe. The drug owner must submit periodic reports to the FDA, including any cases of adverse reactions. For some med - ications, the FDA requires additional post -approval stud - ies (Phase IV) to evaluate long -term effects or to gather information on the use of the product under specified conditions. Throughout the life cycle of a product, the FDA requires compliance with standards relating to good lab - oratory, clinical and manufacturing practices. The FDA also requires compliance with rules pertaining to the manner in which we may promote our products. European Union In the EU, there are three main procedures for applica - tion for authorization to market pharmaceutical products in more than one EU member state at the same time: the centralized procedure, the mutual recognition procedure and the decentralized procedure. It is also possible to obtain a national authorization for products intended for commercialization in a single EU member state only. The procedure used for first authorization must continue to be followed for subsequent changes, e.g., to add an indi - cation for a licensed product. Under the centralized procedure, applications are made to the EMA for an authorization that is valid for the European Union (all member states). The centralized pro - cedure is mandatory for all biotechnology products; new chemical entities in cancer, neurodegenerative disor - ders, diabetes, AIDS, autoimmune diseases and other immune dysfunctions; advanced therapy medicines, such as gene therapy, somatic cell therapy and tis - sue-engineered medicines; and orphan medicines (medicines for rare diseases). It is optional for other new chemical entities, innovative medicinal products, and medicines for which authorization would be in the inter - est of public health. When a pharmaceutical company has gathered data that it believes sufficiently demon - strates a drug's safety, efficacy and quality, the company may submit an application to the EMA. The EMA then receives and validates the application, and the special - ized committee for human medicines, the CHMP, appoints a rapporteur and co -rapporteur to review it. They use experts from their countries to carry out the assessment but can also draw expertise from other member states (\"multinational teams\"). The entire review cycle must be completed within 210 days, although there are \"clock stops\" to allow the company to respond to questions set forth in the rapporteur and co -rapporteur's assessment Item 4. Information on the Company 37report and agreed with the CHMP. The first clock stop is at Day 120 and the clock restarts on Day 121, when the company's complete response is received by the EMA. If there are further aspects of the dossier requiring clar - ification, the CHMP will issue further questions at Day 180, and may also request an oral explanation, in which case the sponsor must not only respond to the further questions but also appear before the committee to jus - tify its responses. On Day 210, the CHMP will take a vote to recommend the approval or non -approval of the appli - cation, and their opinion is transferred to the EC. The final EC decision under this centralized procedure is a single decision that is applicable to all member states. This decision occurs 60 days, on average, after a posi - tive CHMP recommendation. Under both the mutual recognition procedure (MRP) and the decentralized procedure (DCP), the assessment is led by one member state, called the reference mem - ber state (RMS) which then liaises with other member states, known as the concerned member states. In the MRP, the company first obtains a marketing authoriza - tion in the RMS, which is then recognized by the con - cerned member states in 90 days. In the DCP, the appli - cation is done simultaneously in the RMS and all concerned member states. During the DCP, the RMS drafts an assessment report within 120 days. Within an additional 90 days, the concerned member states review the application and can issue objections or requests for additional information. On Day 90, each concerned mem - ber state must be assured that the product is safe and effective, and that it will cause no risks to the public health. Once an agreement has been reached, each member state grants national marketing authorizations for the product. After receiving the marketing authorizations, the company must submit periodic safety reports to the rel - evant health authority (EMA for the centralized proce - dure, national health authorities for DCP or MRP). In addi - tion, pharmacovigilance measures must be implemented and monitored, including the collection, evaluation and expedited reporting of adverse events, and updates to risk management plans. For some medications, post-ap - proval studies (Phase IV) may be imposed to comple - ment available data with additional data to evaluate long- term effects (called a Post-Approval Safety Study, or PASS) or to gather additional efficacy data (called a Post-Approval Efficacy Study, or PAES). European marketing authorizations have an initial duration of five years. The holder of the marketing autho - rization must actively apply for its renewal after this first five-year period. As part of the renewal procedure, the competent authority will perform a full benefit -risk review of the product. Should the authority conclude that the benefit -risk balance is no longer positive, the marketing authorization can be suspended or revoked. Once renewed, the marketing authorization is valid for an unlim - ited period, unless it is determined that the product must be further monitored for safety reasons. In this case, the authority may require another renewal at 10 years. If the holder does not apply for renewal, the marketing autho - rization automatically lapses. Any marketing authoriza - tion that is not followed within three years of its granting by the actual placing on the market of the correspond - ing medicinal product ceases to be valid. Price controls In most of the markets where we operate, the prices of pharmaceutical products are subject to both direct and indirect price controls and to drug reimbursement pro - grams with varying price control mechanisms. Due to increasing political pressure and governmental budget constraints, we expect these mechanisms to remain robust - and potentially even to be strengthened - and to have a continued negative influence on the prices we are able to charge for our products. Direct governmental efforts to control prices United States: President Biden has made comprehen - sive drug pricing reform a priority in the US. Lacking 60 votes in the US Senate, Democrats pursued legislation through a procedure known as budget reconciliation to mandate a negotiation process for drugs covered in Medicare Part D and, eventually, Medicare Part B; rede - sign the Medicare Part D benefit with an out-of-pocket cap for seniors; and impose penalties for drug prices that increase faster than inflation. This legislation did not pass before the end of the 2021 calendar year. However, Dem - ocrats said they plan to revisit it in early 2022 and would like to pass drug pricing reform legislation before cam - paigning for the November mid-term elections begins. Further, by December 31, 2021, 20 US states had passed legislation intended to impact pricing or requiring man - ufacturer price transparency reporting, with eight of these states also allowing for drug affordability (i.e., price control) review boards. The disclosure requirements vary by state. Many states require multiple types of reporting, including for new drug applications, new drug launches, prior notice of price increases, and quarterly or annual reporting. It is expected in 2022 that state legislatures will continue to focus on drug pricing and that similar bills will be passed in more states. Europe: In Europe, our operations are subject to signif - icant price and marketing regulations. Many govern - ments are introducing healthcare reforms in a further attempt to curb increasing healthcare costs. In some member states, these include reforms to permit the reim - bursed use of off-label medicines, despite the presence of licensed alternatives on the market. In the EU, govern - ments influence the price of pharmaceutical products through their control of national healthcare systems that fund a large part of the cost of such products to patients. The downward pressure on healthcare costs in general in the EU, particularly with regard to prescription drugs, is intense. Increasingly strict analyses are applied when evaluating the entry of new products, and as a result, access to innovative medicines is limited based on strict cost -benefit assessments. In addition, prices for mar - keted products are referenced within member states and across international borders, further impacting individ - ual EU member state pricing. Member states also col - laborate to enhance pricing transparency and have started conducting joint health technology assessments, joint pricing negotiations and/or joint purchasing. As an additional control for healthcare budgets, some EU coun - tries have passed legislation to impose further manda - tory rebates for pharmaceutical products and/or finan - cial claw -backs on the pharmaceutical industry. The Item 4. Information on the Company 38calculation of these rebates and claw -backs may lack transparency in some cases and can be difficult to pre - dict. Regulations favoring generics and biosimilars In response to rising healthcare costs, most govern - ments and private medical care providers have estab - lished reimbursement schemes that favor the substitu - tion of generic pharmaceuticals for more expensive brand -name pharmaceuticals. All US states have generic substitution statutes. These statutes permit or require the dispensing pharmacist to substitute a less expensive generic drug instead of an original drug. Other countries, including many European countries, have similar laws. We expect that the pressure for generic substitution will continue to increase. In addition, the US, the EU and other jurisdictions are increasingly crafting laws and regula - tions encouraging the development of biosimilar versions of biologic drugs, which can also be expected to have an impact on pricing. Cross -border sales Price controls in one country can have an impact in other countries as a result of cross -border sales. In the EU, products that we have sold to customers in countries with stringent price controls can be legally resold to cus - tomers in other EU countries at a lower price than the price at which the product is otherwise available in the importing country (known as parallel trade). In North America, products that we have sold to customers in Canada - which has relatively stringent price controls - are sometimes resold into the US, again at a lower price than the price at which the product is otherwise sold in the US. Such imports from Canada and other countries into the US are currently illegal. However, given the increased focus on pharmaceutical prices in the US, the Biden administration, certain members of the US Con - gress, and several US states continued to explore regu - latory and legislative ways to allow the safe importation of pharmaceutical products into the US from select coun - tries, including Canada. Six US states have enacted drug importation laws, but the Secretary of the US Depart - ment of Health and Human Services (HHS) must certify that each state's importation plan is safe and cost-effec - tive before it can be implemented. We expect that pressures on pricing will continue worldwide and will likely increase. Because of these pressures, there can be no certainty that in every instance we will be able to charge prices for a product that, in a particular country or in the aggregate, would enable us to earn an adequate return on our investment in that product. Intellectual property We attach great importance to intellectual property (IP) rights - including patents, trademarks, copyrights, know -how, trade secrets and regulatory data protection - as essential to our purpose of reimagining medicine to improve and extend people's lives, and to protect our investment in research and development, manufacturing and marketing. The IP system provides a means to attract the investments needed to conduct and sustainably finance innovative R&D, and to manage the risks inher - ent in our work. For example, we seek IP protection under applicable laws for significant product developments in major markets. Among other things, patents may cover the products themselves, including the product's active ingredient or ingredients and its formulation. Patents may cover processes for manufacturing a product, including processes for manufacturing intermediate substances used in the manufacture of the product. Patents may also cover particular uses of a product, such as its use to treat a particular disease, or its dosage regimen. In addition, patents may cover tests for certain diseases or biomark - ers - which can improve patient outcomes when admin - istered with certain drugs - as well as assays, research tools and other techniques used to identify new drugs. The protection afforded, which may vary from country to country, depends upon the type of patent, its duration and its scope of coverage. In the US and other countries, the law recognizes that product development and review by the FDA and other health authorities can take an extended period, and pro - vides an extension of patent term for a period related to the time taken for the conduct of clinical trials and for the health authority's review. However, the length of this extension and the patents to which it applies cannot be known in advance and can only be determined after the product is approved. In practice, it is not uncommon for patent term extensions (PTEs) or supplementary protec - tion certificates (SPCs) to not fully account for the time it took to develop the product and receive marketing authorization. As a result, for example, it is rarely the case that a product's active ingredient(s) will have a full pat - ent term at the time the product is approved by the FDA and other health authorities. In addition to patent protection, various countries pro - vide regulatory data protection (RDP) or regulato - ry-based marketing exclusivities for a prescribed period of time. RDP is a distinct type of IP right providing exclu - sivity that precludes a potential competitor from filing a regulatory application that relies on the sponsor's clini - cal trial data, or that precludes the regulatory authority from approving the application for a set period of time. The RDP period can vary depending upon the type of data included in the sponsor's application. When it is available, market exclusivity, unlike RDP, may preclude a competitor from obtaining marketing approval for a prod - uct even if a competitor's application relies on its own data. RDP and market exclusivity periods generally run from the date a product is approved, and so their expi - ration dates cannot be known with certainty until the product approval date is known and exclusivity has been granted by the relevant authorities. United States Patents In the US, a patent issued for an application filed today will receive a term of 20 years from the earliest applica - tion filing date, subject to potential patent term adjust - ments for delays in patent issuance based upon certain delays in prosecution by the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO). A US pharmaceutical patent that claims a product, method of treatment using a prod - uct, or method of manufacturing a product may also be eligible for a PTE. This type of extension may only extend Item 4. Information on the Company 39the patent term for a maximum of five years, and may not extend the patent term beyond 14 years from regulatory approval. Only one patent may be extended for any prod - uct based on FDA review. RDP and market exclusivity Separate from patent exclusivities, the FDA may provide RDP or regulatory-based market exclusivity, which runs in parallel to any patent protection. A new small -molecule active pharmaceutical ingredi - ent receives five years of RDP, during which time a com - petitor generally may not submit or obtain approval of an application to the FDA based on a sponsor's clini - cal data. A new biologic active pharmaceutical ingredient receives 12 years of regulatory-based market exclusiv - ity, during which time a competitor generally may not market the same or similar drug. The FDA may also request that a sponsor conduct pediatric studies and, in exchange, it will grant an addi - tional six -month period of pediatric market exclusivity if the FDA accepts the data, the sponsor makes a timely application for approval for pediatric treatment, and the sponsor has a patent -based and/or regulato - ry-based exclusivity period for the product that can be extended. Orphan drug exclusivity provides seven years of mar - ket exclusivity for drugs designated by the FDA as orphan drugs, meaning drugs that treat rare diseases. During this period, a potential competitor generally may not market the same or similar drug for the same indi - cation even if the competitor's application does not rely on data from the sponsor. European community Patents Patent applications in Europe may be filed in the Euro - pean Patent Office (EPO) or in a particular country or countries. The EPO system permits a single application to be granted for the EU plus other non -EU countries such as Switzerland, Turkey and the UK. When the EPO grants a patent, it is then validated in the countries that the patent owner designates. The term of a patent granted by the EPO or a European country office is 20 years from the earliest application filing date. Phar - maceutical patents can be granted a further period of exclusivity under the SPC system. SPCs are designed, in part, to account for the time it took to receive market - ing authorization of a product by the European health authorities. An SPC may be granted to provide, in com - bination with the patent, up to 15 years of exclusivity from the date of the first European marketing authorization. However, an SPC cannot last longer than five years. The SPC duration may be extended by a further six months if the product is the subject of an agreed pediatric inves - tigation plan. The post -grant phase of patents, including the SPC system, is currently administered on a coun - try-by-country basis under national laws that, while dif - fering, are intended to (but do not always) have the same effect.RDP and market exclusivity Separate from patent exclusivities, the EU provides a system of regulatory data protection for authorized human medicines that runs in parallel to any patent pro - tection. The system for new drugs being approved today is usually referred to as \"8+2+1\" because it provides an initial period of eight years of data protection, during which a competitor cannot rely on the relevant data; a further period of two years of market exclusivity, during which the data can be used to support applications for marketing authorization but a competitive product can - not be launched; and a possible one -year extension of the market exclusivity period if, during the initial eight -year data exclusivity period, the sponsor registered a new therapeutic indication with \"significant clinical benefit.\" This system applies both to national and centralized authorizations in the EU plus other non-EU countries such as the UK. The EU also has an orphan drug exclusivity system for medicines. If a medicine is designated as an orphan drug, then it benefits from 10 years of market exclusivity after it is authorized, during which time an application for the same or similar medicine for the same indication will not generally be accepted or granted. Under certain cir - cumstances, this exclusivity can be extended with a two-year pediatric extension. Third-party patents and challenges to intellectual property Third parties can challenge our IP, including patents, pat - ent term extensions, RDP and marketing exclusivities (such as pediatric extensions and orphan drug exclusiv - ity), through various proceedings. For example, patents in the US can be challenged in the USPTO through var - ious proceedings, including Inter Partes Review (IPR) and Post-Grant Review (PGR) proceedings. They may also be challenged through patent infringement litigation under the Abbreviated New Drug Application (ANDA) provisions of the Hatch -Waxman Act or under the Bio - logics Price Competition and Innovation Act (BPCIA). In the EU, patents may be challenged through oppositions in the EPO, or national patents may be challenged in national courts or national patent offices. The outcomes of such challenges can be difficult to predict. In addition to directly challenging our IP rights, in some circumstances a competitor may be able to mar - ket a generic version of one of our products by, for exam - ple, designing around our patents or marketing the generic product for non -patent-protected indications, or filing a separate New Drug Application (NDA) under the Hatch-Waxman Act (typically referred to as a 505(b)(2) application). Despite RDP, a competitor could opt to incur the costs of conducting its own clinical trials and prepar - ing its own regulatory application, and avoid our RDP altogether. There is a risk that some countries may seek to impose limitations on or seek not to recognize the availability of IP rights for pharmaceutical products, or limit the extent to which such rights may be enforced. Also, even though we may own, co -own or in -license pat - ents protecting our products, and conduct free - dom -to-operate analyses, a third party may nevertheless assert that one of our products infringes a third-party patent for which we do not have a license, seeking rem -Item 4. Information on the Company 40edies such as monetary damages or an injunction against our continued marketing of the product. As a result, there can be no assurance that our IP rights will protect our products or that we will be able to avoid adverse effects from the loss of IP protection or from third-party patents in the future. Intellectual property protection for certain key marketed products and compounds in development We present below additional details regarding certain IP protection for the listed Innovative Medicines Division products. For each, we identify issued, unexpired pat - ents by their general subject matter and, in parentheses, years of expiry in, if relevant, the US and the EU. The identified patents are owned, co -owned or exclusively in-licensed by Novartis and relate to at least one dosage strength of the product or to the method of treatment or its use as it is currently approved and marketed or, in the case of a compound in development, as it is currently submitted to the FDA and/or the EMA for approval. Iden - tification of an EU patent refers to national patents in EU countries and/or to the national patents that have been derived from a patent granted by the EPO. Novartis may own, co-own, control or have rights to additional patents, for example, relating to compound forms, methods of treatment or use, formulations, devices, processes, prod - uct-by-process, synthesis, purification and detection. We identify unexpired RDP periods and, in parenthe - ses, years of expiry if the relevant marketing authoriza - tions have been authorized or granted. We identify cer - tain unexpired patent term extensions and marketing exclusivities and, in parentheses, years of expiry if they are granted; their subject matter scope may be limited and is not specified. Marketing exclusivities and patent term extensions include orphan drug exclusivity (ODE), pediatric exclusivity (PE), patent term extension (PTE) and supplementary protection certificate (SPC). We des - ignate them as \"pending\" if they have been applied for but not granted and include years of expiry if estimable. Such pending applications may or may not ultimately be granted. In the case of the EU, identification of a patent, sup - plementary protection certificate, marketing exclusivity or regulatory data protection means grant, authorization and maintenance in at least one EU country or the UK. However, it could be pending, not granted, expired or found invalid in others. For each product below, we indicate whether there is current generic or biosimilar competition for one or more product versions in one or more approved indica - tions in either the US or one or more EU countries, if IP is otherwise disclosed. We identify certain enforcement actions, or ongoing challenges to the disclosed IP, includ - ing IPRs or PGRs if instituted by the USPTO, that have not been finally resolved (including appeals) unless noted. Challenges identified as being in administrative entities, such as national patent offices, include judicial appeals from decisions of those entities. Resolution of challenges to the disclosed IP, which in the EU may involve IP in one or more EU countries, may include set - tlement agreements under which Novartis permits or does not permit future launch of generic versions of our products before expiration of that IP. We identify certain material terms of such settlement agreements where they could have a material adverse effect on our busi - ness. In other cases, such settlement agreements may contain confidentiality obligations restricting what may be disclosed.

Information on the Company 43 Sandoz Our Sandoz Division is a global leader in generic pharmaceuticals and biosimilars, and sells products in well over 100 countries. In 2021, the Sandoz Division achieved consolidated net sales of USD 9.6 billion, rep - resenting 18.7% of the Group's total net sales. Sandoz develops, manufactures and markets finished dosage form medicines as well as intermediary products includ - ing active pharmaceutical ingredients. Sandoz is organized globally into three franchises: Retail Generics, Anti -Infectives and Biopharmaceuticals. In Retail Generics, Sandoz develops, manufactures and markets active ingredients and finished dosage forms of small-molecule pharmaceuticals to third parties across a broad range of therapeutic areas, as well as finished dosage form anti-infectives sold to third parties. In Anti-Infectives, Sandoz manufactures and supplies active pharmaceutical ingredients and intermediates - mainly antibiotics - for internal use by Retail Generics and for sale to third -party customers. In Biopharmaceu - ticals, Sandoz develops, manufactures and markets pro - tein- and other biotechnology -based products, including biosimilars, and provides biotechnology manufacturing services to other companies. The Sandoz strategic ambition is to be the world's leading and most valued generics company (including biosimilars). Our divisional strategy focuses on three areas: developing a broad and consistent pipeline of generic and biosimilar launches across key geographies and across a broad range of therapeutic areas; position - ing Sandoz to be \"first in\" by having a strong pipeline with a focus on being first to market and \"last out\" by way of competitive costs and stable supply; and instilling a true \"generic mindset,\" with a focus on priorities, simple and rapid decision-making, and focused resource allocation. Sandoz is a global market leader in biosimilars, with a total of eight approved and marketed products, and a pipeline of over 15 molecules. In addition to internally developed projects, our biosimilar portfolio comprises publicly announced commercialization agreements with BioCon, Gan & Lee, EirGenix, Polpharma Biologics and Bio-Thera Solutions Ltd. Availability of our biosimilars varies by country. Sandoz is also the global market leader in generic antibiotics by volume. Its Kundl, Austria, manufacturing site is the hub of the last vertically integrated antibiotics production chain in Europe, which offers certain com -petitive advantages including added supply chain resil - ience. On January 31, 2020, we closed the previously announced acquisition of the Japanese business of Aspen Global Incorporated, consisting of off-patent branded medicines with a focus on anesthetics and spe - cialty brands. On July 27, 2020, Sandoz and the Austrian govern - ment announced a planned combined investment of more than EUR 150 million to enhance the long-term competitiveness and supply resilience of European pro - duction for key antibiotics. In May 2021, Sandoz con - firmed details of its investment of EUR 100 million in its Kundl, Austria, manufacturing site and announced an additional EUR 50 million investment in a new sterile pro - duction line in Palafolls, Spain. In October 2021, Sandoz announced that its planned acquisition of GSK's global cephalosporin antibiotics business, first announced in February 2021, had been successfully closed. On October 1, 2021, Sandoz Inc., the US subsidiary of Sandoz, entered into a settlement agreement with the Civil Division of the US Department of Justice (DOJ) con - cerning the department's yearslong pricing investigation into the US generic drug industry. This settlement was an expected outcome of the resolution the company reached in March 2020 with the DOJ Antitrust Division regarding the same investigation and underlying con - duct. As part of the settlement, Sandoz agreed to cer - tain corporate integrity obligations as part of a corporate integrity agreement with the Office of Inspector General of the US Department of Health and Human Services. The latest settlement contains no new factual allegations against Sandoz and, in 2020, the Group fully provisioned for this settlement and disclosed the agreement in prin - ciple as part of the March 2020 resolution. For more information, see \"Item 18. Financial Statements\u2014Note 20. Provisions and other non-current liabilities.\" In October 2021, we announced the commencement of a strategic review of our Sandoz Division. This review will explore all options, ranging from retaining the busi - ness to separation, to determine how to best maximize value for our shareholders. Key marketed products The Sandoz global portfolio covers a wide range of therapeutic areas. The following are some of the Sandoz key marketed products in each of its franchises (availability varies by market): Retail Generics Product Originator drug Description Amoxicillin/clavulanic acid Augmentin 4.

In patent litigation with Amgen, which markets Enbrel\u00ae, the US District Court of New Jersey ruled against Sandoz in August 2019, which was upheld on appeal. The decision is now final and Sandoz cannot launch its Erelzi product in the US until 2029.

Information on the Company 45Principal markets The two largest generics markets in the world - the US and Europe - are the principal markets for Sandoz. The following table sets forth the aggregate 2021 net sales of Sandoz by region: Sandoz 2021 net sales to third parties USD millions % Europe 5278 55 United States 1819 19 Asia, Africa, Australasia 1662 17 Canada and Latin America 872 9 Total 9631 100 Of which in Established Markets 1 6855 71 Of which in Emerging Growth Markets 1 2776 29 1 Emerging Growth Markets comprise all markets other than the Established Markets of the US, Canada, Western Europe, Japan, Australia and New Zealand. Many Sandoz products are used for chronic conditions that require patients to consume the product over long peri - ods of time, from months to years. Sales of our anti -infective products and over-the-counter cough and cold prod - ucts are subject to material changes in seasonal demand, while sales of the vast majority of our other products are not. The COVID-19 pandemic has substantially impacted seasonal variation. Production For information on the production of our products, see \"\u2014Item 4.B Business overview\u2014Innovative Medicines\u2014Production.\" In September 2020, as part of a broader reorganiza - tion of Novartis Technical Operations (NTO), we estab - lished the Sandoz Technical Operations (STO) platform within NTO. STO focuses on producing generic medicines for Sandoz, as well as related external supply operations and supply chain. Due to impurities found in the active ingredient batches sourced from third-party manufacturers, we recalled Sandoz valsartan, losartan and irbesartan prod - ucts in the second half of 2018 and the first quarter of 2019, and ranitidine film-coated tablets in the second half of 2019, from several markets, in line with our qual - ity standards for all of our marketed products. The dis - covery of nitrosamines in some types of drug products led several health regulators (e.g., EMA, FDA and others) to conduct a detailed analysis of these impurities in affected medicinal products. Novartis works with health authorities around the world to continuously review all chemical and biological human medicines for the possi - ble presence of nitrosamines. The EMA, FDA and other health authorities have provided guidance to the phar - maceutical industry to prevent unacceptable levels of nitrosamines in medicines. The EMA review concluded in March 2021 for chemical human medicines and in July 2021 for biological human medicines. Any products iden - tified with a potential risk for nitrosamines will undergo further testing. For these products, the final outcome of this testing and potentially necessary control strategies will be submitted to the EMA and other health authori - ties by September 2022. Beginning in September 2021, we initiated a volun - tary recall of all finished product batches of losartan and losartan HCT products exceeding or potentially exceed -ing acceptable regulatory limits of the azido impurity in the losartan drug substance. This impurity, which is an industrywide issue, is a mutagen that may increase the risk of cancer over time if allowed to rise above certain levels. This recall is unrelated to the nitrosamine-related recalls described above, and we are working to re-es - tablish supply as soon as practicable. Marketing and sales Sandoz sells a broad portfolio of products, including the products of our Retail Generics franchise and biosimi - lars, to wholesalers, pharmacies, hospitals and other healthcare outlets. Sandoz adapts its marketing and sales approach to local decision-making processes, depending on the structure of the market in each coun - try. In response to rising healthcare costs, many govern - ments and private medical care providers, such as health maintenance organizations, have instituted reimburse - ment schemes that favor the substitution of bioequiva - lent generic versions of originator pharmaceutical prod - ucts, such as those sold by our Retail Generics franchise. In the US, statutes have been enacted by all states that permit or require pharmacists to substitute a less expen - sive generic product for the brand -name version of a drug that has been prescribed to a patient. Generic use is growing in Europe, but penetration rates in many EU countries (as a percentage of volume) remain well below those in the US. Recent trends have been toward continued consoli - dation among distributors and retailers of Sandoz prod - ucts, both in the US and internationally, which has increased our customers' purchasing leverage. Legislative or regulatory changes can have a signifi - cant impact on our business in a country. For more infor -Item 4. Information on the Company 46mation on such changes, see \"\u2014Item 4.B Business over - view\u2014Innovative Medicines\u2014Price controls.\" Our Anti franchise supplies active phar - maceutical ingredients and intermediates - mainly anti - biotics - for internal use by Retail Generics and for sale to the pharmaceutical industry worldwide. Our Biopharmaceuticals franchise operates in an already mature market framework in Europe and some other markets, while the business environment is rapidly evolving in the US and many international markets. Reg - ulatory pathways for approving biosimilar products are at various stages of maturity by market, but in some cases are still relatively new or still in development. Pol - icies have not yet been fully defined or implemented regarding the substitution and reimbursement of biosim - ilars in many markets, including the US. As a result, in many of these markets, our biosimilar products are mar - keted as branded competitors to the originator products. Competition The market for generic products is characterized by increasing demand for high -quality pharmaceuticals that can be marketed at lower costs due to comparatively minimal initial research and development investments. Increasing pressure on healthcare expenditure and numerous patent and data exclusivity period expirations have encouraged more generic product launches, result - ing in increased competition among the companies sell - ing generic pharmaceutical products, leading to ongoing price pressure. In particular, Sandoz faces increased industrywide pressure on prices for generic products, particularly in the US, driven by factors including cus - tomer consolidation and growing competition from other manufacturers of generic medicines. These factors con - tributed to a decline in industrywide US sales that began in 2017 and continued through 2021. Development and registration Development of Sandoz Biopharmaceuticals is jointly overseen by Sandoz and GDD, and is governed by the IMB. Development and registration activities for Retail Generics products, and registration activities for Bio - pharmaceuticals products, are also overseen by Sandoz. Before a generic pharmaceutical may be marketed, intensive technical and clinical development work must be performed to demonstrate, in bioavailability studies, the bioequivalence of the generic product to the refer - ence product. Nevertheless, research and development costs associated with generic pharmaceuticals are gen - erally much lower than those of the originator pharmaceuticals, as no original drug discovery, preclin - ical studies or clinical trials on dose finding, safety and efficacy are typically performed by the generics com - pany. As a result, the different focus and lower costs of the generic pharmaceutical model ultimately allow generic pharmaceutical products to be offered at lower prices, which support and contribute to the cost contain - ment goals of healthcare systems. While generic pharmaceuticals are follow -on ver - sions of chemically synthesized molecules, biosimilar products contain a version of the active substance of an already approved biological reference medicine. Due to the inherent variability and complexity of biologic prod - ucts, including batch -to-batch differences and variations following manufacturing changes, the development and the regulatory pathway of biosimilars differ significantly from that of generics. The development of a biosimilar product is much more technically challenging than the development of a typical generic small-molecule pharmaceutical. While generic pharmaceuticals normally do not require clinical studies in patients, regulators worldwide do require such targeted studies for biosimilar products. Biosimilars are engineered to match the reference medicine in quality, safety and efficacy. This is achieved by systematically defining the target range of the reference medicine and then comparing the biosimilar to the reference medicine at various development stages to confirm biosimilarity and to establish that there are no clinically meaningful differences between the proposed biosimilar and the ref - erence biologic. Because the purpose of a biosimilar clin - ical development program is to confirm biosimilarity and not to establish efficacy and safety de novo, the clinical studies required are less than those required for a ref - erence biologic. Therefore, the cost of development for a biosimilar is usually less than that of a reference bio - logic. The development and registration staff employed by affiliates of the Sandoz Division are based worldwide, including at facilities in In November 2020, Sandoz com - pleted (i) the previously announced closure of the Holz - kirchen, Germany, development and registration site, with the exception of patch development and the proj - ect management group, and (ii) the closure of the prod - uct development and registration site as well as the main - tenance and development regulatory centers in Unterach, Austria. We are conducting a review of our global devel - opment and regulatory network to consolidate and streamline operations and optimize our network struc - ture to enable Sandoz to compete sustainably in an increasingly challenging generics environment. As part of this review, in the fourth quarter of 2020, Sandoz announced the planned closure of its maintenance reg - ulatory center in Barleben, Germany, which was com - pleted in December 2021. Sandoz also announced the planned closure of the Fougera development center located in Melville, New York, as well as the product development center in Boucherville, Canada, which were completed in April 2021 and June 2021, respectively. Regulation Generics The Hatch -Waxman Act in the US (and similar legislation in the EU and in other countries) eliminated the require - ment that manufacturers of generic pharmaceuticals repeat the extensive clinical trials required for reference products, so long as the generic version could be shown to be therapeutically equivalent to the reference prod - uct.Item 4. Information on the Company 47In the US, the decision on whether a generic phar - maceutical is therapeutically equivalent to the original product is made by the FDA based on an Abbreviated New Drug Application (ANDA) filed by the generic prod - uct's manufacturer. An ANDA is generally permitted to be filed four years after the initial approval of the refer - ence product and generally cannot be fully approved by the FDA until any regulatory exclusivity of the reference product has expired. The process typically takes nearly two years from the filing of the ANDA until FDA approval. However, delays can occur if issues arise, for example, regarding the interpretation of bioequivalence study data, labeling requirements for the generic product, or qualifying the supply of active ingredients. In addition, the Hatch -Waxman Act requires a generic manufacturer to certify in certain situations that the generic product does not infringe on any current applicable patents on the product held by the holder of the marketing authori - zation for the reference product, or to certify that such patents are invalid. This certification often results in a patent infringement lawsuit being brought against the generics company. In the event of such a lawsuit, the Hatch -Waxman Act imposes an automatic 30-month delay in the approval of the ANDA to allow the parties to resolve the intellectual property issues. For generic applicants who are the first to file their ANDA containing a certification claiming non -infringement or patent inva - lidity, the Hatch -Waxman Act generally provides those applicants with 180 days of marketing exclusivity, enabling such generic applicants to exclusively market their product alongside the reference product at a cer - tain point in time, which is generally after any intellectual property issues have been resolved. However, after such point in time, the generic applicants must launch their products within certain time frames or risk losing the marketing exclusivity that they had gained by being a first-to-file applicant. In the EU, decisions on the granting of a marketing authorization are made either by the European Commis - sion based on a positive recommendation by the EMA under the centralized procedure, or by a single member state under the national or decentralized procedure. See \"\u2014Innovative Medicines\u2014Regulation\u2014European Union.\" Companies may submit abridged applications for approval of a generic medicinal product based upon its \"essential similarity\" to a medicinal product authorized and marketed in the EU following the expiration of the product's data exclusivity period. In such cases, the generics company is able to submit its abridged appli - cation based on the data submitted by the innovator com - pany for the reference product, without the need to con - duct extensive Phase III clinical trials of its own. For all products that received a marketing authorization in the EU after late 2005, the abridged application can be sub - mitted throughout the EU. However, the data submitted by the innovator company in support of its application for a marketing authorization for the reference product is generally protected for 10 years after the first grant of marketing authorization in all member states, and can be extended for an additional year if, during the initial eight -year data exclusivity period, the innovator company registers a new therapeutic indication with \"significant clinical benefit.\" In the case of orphan drugs, it may be extended with a two -year pediatric extension. See \"\u2014Item 4.B Business overview\u2014Innovative Medicines\u2014 Intellectual property.\" Biosimilars The regulatory pathways for approval of biosimilar medicines are still being developed and established in many countries of the world. A regulatory framework for the approval of biosimilars has been established in the EU, Japan, Canada and the US, while the World Health Organization (WHO) has issued guidance. Sandoz has successfully registered and launched the first biosimilar (or biosimilar-type) medicine in Europe, the US, Canada, Japan, Taiwan, Australia, and many countries in Latin America and Asia. Sandoz was the first company to secure approval for and launch a biosimilar under the US biosimilar pathway that was established as part of the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act (BPCIA). The approval of biosimilars in Europe follows a process similar to that followed for small molecules. However, biosimilars usually have to be approved through the cen - tralized procedure because they are manufactured using recombinant DNA technology. As part of the approval process in the EU, biosimilars have to demonstrate com - parability to the reference medicine in terms of safety, efficacy and quality through an extensive comparability exercise, based on strict guidelines set by the authori - ties. Regulators will only approve a biosimilar based on data that allows the regulators to conclude that there are no clinically meaningful differences between the refer - ence medicine and the biosimilar. In the US, under the BPCIA, a biosimilar must be highly similar with no clinically meaningful differences compared to the reference medicine. Approval of a bio - similar in the US requires the submission of a BLA to the FDA, including an assessment of immunogenicity and pharmacokinetics; an efficacy study; and possibly a phar - macodynamics study. The BLA for a biosimilar can be submitted as soon as four years after the initial approval of the reference biologic, but can only be approved 12 years after the initial approval of the reference bio - logic. Intellectual property We take all reasonable steps to ensure that our products do not infringe valid intellectual property rights held by others, including taking steps to proactively challenge intellectual property rights that we believe should not have been granted. Nevertheless, competing companies commonly assert patent and other intellectual property rights. As a result, we can become involved in significant litigation regarding our products. If we are unsuccessful in defending these suits, we could be subject to injunc - tions preventing us from selling our products and to potentially substantial damages. Wherever possible, our products are protected by our own patents. Among other things, patents may cover the products themselves, including the product's formu - lation, or the processes for manufacturing a product. However, there can be no assurance that our intellectual property will protect our products or that we will be able Item 4. Information on the Company 48to avoid adverse effects from the loss of intellectual prop - erty protection in the future. 4.C Organizational structure Organizational structure See \"Item 4.

Financial Statements\u2014Note 30. Dis - continued operations.\" Our business environment We operate in a complex, fast-moving environment. Inno - vation is accelerating, driven by better understanding of the genetic and biological roots of disease, and surging use of data analytics and digital technology in health - care. At the same time, people around the world are liv - ing longer, fueling a rise in chronic diseases. Together, these factors are increasing demand for high-quality care and pressuring healthcare systems to restrain spending growth. Healthcare demand and associated spending are expected to rise, post-COVID-19 . Global demand for healthcare will continue to grow over the next five years, supported by renewed economic growth and increased investment in healthcare in many countries after the COVID-19 pandemic. We see future growth for our business in many markets around the world, including in the US and - over the longer term - in China. Meanwhile, pressure on pharmaceutical pricing is expected to continue as payers around the world step up initiatives to reduce the overall cost of healthcare. Innovation continues to accelerate . Medical innovation is accelerating, as technologies like gene therapy and artificial intelligence open new paths to scientific dis - covery. Increased cooperation within the industry, high - lighted by the development of COVID-19 vaccines and therapeutics, could lead to a new era of open science. At the same time, innovation is getting harder, with new discoveries requiring significant long-term investment. Item 5. Operating and Financial Review and Prospects 52 Use of data and technology is expanding across our industry . The use of data science and digital technolo - gies is increasing rapidly across our industry - in every - thing from clinical trials and manufacturing to patient diagnostics and treatment. COVID-19 has accelerated this trend. Meanwhile, customers want more efficient and personalized ways to connect with pharmaceuti - cal companies. Against this backdrop, data privacy and cybersecurity are growing in importance. Access to healthcare remains a global challenge . According to the World Health Organization (WHO), almost a third of the world's population does not have access to the medicines they need. For the past five years, access rates in the poorest countries have been declining. Meanwhile, the COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted deep health inequities in both developed and developing countries. Access can be improved by integrating access strategies into how we research, develop and deliver our new medicines globally. Aging populations are driving a rise in noncommunica - ble diseases . As the complexity of the world's health - care challenges grows, the nature of the global disease burden is also changing. Aging populations are fueling a rise in noncommunicable conditions such as heart disease and cancer, driving an increase in disability and putting additional pressure on healthcare systems. New ways of working are here to stay even after COVID- 19. COVID-19 changed our work habits. Post-pandemic, many employees continue to want more flexibility in how they work. Within our own workforce, there is more emphasis on digital skills, which are in increasingly short supply across the economy. At the same time, workplace diversity has become more important than ever to attract and retain talented employees, and sup - port innovation. Climate crisis is threatening to undermine global health gains. Climate change is already causing extreme heat and poor air quality in some areas, which threaten to exacerbate pre-existing health conditions such as respiratory diseases. In addition, an increase in tem - perature and humidity may cause a proliferation of insects that carry vector-borne diseases, including dengue fever and malaria. Ultimately, climate change could undermine decades of progress in improving human health at a time when antimicrobial resistance is also rising. There is an opportunity to build public trust in wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. COVID-19 has brought an opportunity to reset public trust in our industry, with companies working together to end the pandemic. Trust matters for our industry: Our success depends on patents and trademarks that are granted by society and protect the long-term investments required for our business. Trust also matters for patient engagement, for working with regulators and policymakers, and for attracting talented employees. Our strategy Our strategy is to build a focused medicines company powered by technology leadership in research and development (R&D), world-class commercialization, global access and data science. In 2021, we continued to execute on this strategy, as reflected by our com - mencement of a strategic review of our Sandoz Division and the divestment of our investment in Roche in a bilat - eral transaction with Roche (see \"Item 18. Financial Statements\u2014Note 2. Significant transactions\"). As we implement our strategy, we have five priorities to shape our future and help us continue to create value for our company, our shareholders and society: Deliver transformative innovation In our pursuit of transformative treatments, we seek to find new ways to cure disease, intervene earlier in chronic illnesses and improve patients' quality of life. We have one of the strongest clinical development programs in the industry, with more than 275 research programs as well as 98 assets in development spanning around 50 diseases - from heart disease and cancer to rare but debilitating genetic disorders - and 71 new molecular entities, with the potential to transform the standard of care for patients. We invest in technology platforms - including cell and gene therapies and radioligand therapies - that offer more targeted approaches to fighting and, in some cases, potentially curing serious diseases. We invested USD 9.5 billion in research and development in 2021, or approximately 18.5% of our net sales. We use data and digital strategies in our research and development oper - ations to open new paths to scientific discovery, improve patient outcomes and streamline the development pro - cess. We also focus our R&D capabilities on global health challenges like malaria and sickle cell disease. Embrace operational excellence We work to improve the productivity of our operations while maintaining high standards of patient safety and environmental sustainability. Our efforts cut across the Company, with special emphasis on manufacturing and our supply chain, new product launches and business services. These activities underpin our investment in innovation and support our financial performance, while helping to build trust with stakeholders. In our commer - cial operations, we are taking steps to deliver more focused and consistent launches across key markets to support our long-term financial performance and pro - vide better outcomes for patients and customers. We are transforming our manufacturing operations to support our strategy, while reducing the environmen - tal footprint of our facilities and helping to produce vac - cines for COVID-19. In addition, patient health and safety is fundamental to our purpose, and our activities in this regard are focused on three areas: product quality, phar - macovigilance and combating falsified medicines. Our supply chain is key to the resilience of our operations: We identify, assess, monitor and mitigate risk associated with suppliers through our Third-Party Risk Management framework, which promotes ethical behavior and fosters sustainability. With a view toward delivering efficient and effective business services, in 2021 we merged all busi - ness services and technology operations into a new organization called Customer & Technology Solutions (CTS). CTS will further accelerate productivity improve -Item 5. Operating and Financial Review and Prospects 53ments while investing to support the business to imple - ment our strategy. Go big on data and digital Our aim is to transform Novartis into a medicines com - pany powered by data science and digital technologies. Using data, we believe, can improve efficiency, drive sales and innovation, and ultimately increase the value of our pipeline of new medicines. We plan to achieve this by focusing on four areas: (i) accelerating innovation by embracing data analytics and applying artificial intelli - gence and other technologies to the challenge of dis - covering new medicines, and forming partnerships with technology companies big and small; (ii) engaging cus - tomers by investing in digital tools to provide personal - ization and better experiences, while also providing dig - ital health solutions for patients; (iii) embedding data and digital in our operations by using technologies like arti - ficial intelligence to drive greater efficiency and cost sav - ings across our own operations, and to promote training opportunities to develop digital skills among our employ - ees; and (iv) using data responsibly and securely to ensure the ethical use of new technologies and prioritize effective data privacy and cybersecurity. Unleash the power of people We continue to transform our corporate culture to sup - port our long-term performance. We want every employee to feel inspired by our purpose, be curious about new ideas, and work in an unbossed environment that encour - ages initiative and teamwork. We are exploring new ways of working, post-pandemic, to give employees greater flexibility, while maintaining a focus on productivity and innovation, and ensure we continue to attract world-class talent. At the same time, we are making progress in diver - sity and inclusion to support employee engagement and bring us closer to the diverse perspectives of patients and other stakeholders. We aim to achieve gender bal - ance in management and fulfill our United Nations (UN) pay equity and transparency pledge by 2023. Build trust with society Building trust with customers, patients, partners and our employees is critical to delivering on our purpose. It defines our approach to managing our key environmen - tal, social and corporate governance (ESG) topics: being a part of the solution on pricing and access, addressing global health challenges, being a responsible citizen, and holding ourselves to high ethical standards. We seek to expand access to our medicines to patients in both devel - oped and developing countries, while addressing major global health challenges. We reached 56.2 million patients in 2021 through access initiatives, and we have set ambitious targets to reinforce our commitments to access and global health. We focus our global health efforts on the control or elimination of four priority dis - eases: (i) sickle cell disease, (ii) Chagas disease, (iii) malaria and (iv) leprosy. In 2020, Novartis committed to increase patient reach with our strategic innovative therapies by at least 200% by 2025 (compared with 2019), and we aim to increase patient reach of our four global health flagship programs by at least 50% over the same period. To rein - force our commitment to these targets, we issued a EUR 1.85 billion sustainability-linked bond (SLB) in 2020. The bond is the first of its kind in the healthcare industry and the first SLB incorporating social targets, with bondhold - ers entitled to receive a higher amount of interest if Novartis fails to meet its access targets. Our stakehold - ers expect us to follow high ethical standards wherever we operate: We are making progress in embedding our Code of Ethics across the organization and supporting employees to do what is right when faced with ethical dilemmas. We are also committed to being a responsi - ble corporate citizen by reducing the environmental foot - print of our Company. We are committed to becoming carbon neutral in our own operations by 2025 and car - bon neutral across our value chain by 2030. In addition, we are committed to achieving net zero across our value chain by 2040. We also aim to be water and plastic neu - tral by 2030.Item 5.

Operating and Financial Review and Prospects 55Group overview The COVID-19 situation continues to evolve and is tak - ing differing courses across the multitude of geographies that Novartis operates in. We continue to take strong actions to help address the pandemic consequences. Our primary concerns remain the health and safety of our employees and patients. During the year, the COVID-19 situation normalized in most geographies and therapeutic areas, however we still saw a slight impact on parts of our business, mainly in oncology and generics. Our operations remain stable and cash collections continue to be according to our nor - mal trade terms, with days sales outstanding at normal levels. Novartis remains well positioned to meet its ongo - ing financial obligations and has sufficient liquidity to sup - port our normal business activities. At present, drug development operations are continuing with manageable disruptions, with our range of digital technologies allow - ing us to proactively manage our clinical trials portfolio and rapidly mitigate any disruptions (see the section on compounds in development and selected development projects of our divisions within \"Item 4. Information on the Company\u2014Item 4.B Business overview\"). In 2021, Novartis delivered sales growth, margin expansion, and advanced its pipeline. Net sales to third parties for Novartis continuing oper - ations were USD 51.6 billion, up 6% in reported terms and up 4% measured in constant currencies (cc) to remove the impact of exchange rate movements. Sales growth was driven by volume growth of 8 percentage points, mainly driven by Entresto , Cosentyx , Zolgensma and Novartis Oncology business unit. The strong volume growth was partly offset by the negative impacts of pricing (2 percentage points) and generic competition (2 percentage points). By division, Innovative Medicines delivered net sales of USD 42.0 billion (+8%, +6% cc). Sandoz net sales were USD 9.6 billion (0%, -2% cc), as growth from Biophar - maceuticals and 1 percentage point relating to contract manufacturing revenue reclassification was more than offset by negative price impact and softer Retail Gener - ics demand. In Emerging Growth Markets, which comprise all mar - kets excluding the US, Canada, Western Europe, Japan, Australia and New Zealand, sales from continuing oper -ations were USD 13.3 billion (+12%, +11% cc) driven by China (USD 3.1 billion) growing 19% (+11% cc). Operating income from continuing operations was USD 11.7 billion (+15%, +13% cc), mainly driven by higher sales and lower legal expenses, partly offset by increased M&S and R&D investments and higher amortization. Operating income margin was 22.6% of net sales, increasing by 1.7 percentage points (+1.8 percentage points cc). Net income was USD 24.0 billion compared to USD 8.1 billion in the prior year benefiting from the USD 14.6 billion gain from the divestment of our investment in Roche Holding AG, Basel (Roche)1. Earnings per share were USD 10.71 compared to USD 3.55 in the prior year. Net cash flows from operating activities from con - tinuing operations amounted to USD 15.1 billion, com - pared to USD 13.6 billion in 2020. This increase was mainly driven by higher net income adjusted for non-cash items and other adjustments, including divestment gains, and lower payments out of provisions, mainly due to legal matters in the prior year. This was partly offset by unfa - vorable hedging results. Free cash flow increased to USD 13.3 billion (+14% USD). This was mainly driven by higher operating income adjusted for non-cash items and lower payments for legal provisions, partly offset by USD 650 million upfront pay- ment to in-license tislelizumab from an affiliate of Bei - Gene, Ltd. We also present our core results2, which exclude the impact of amortization, impairments, disposals, acquisi - tions, restructurings and other significant items, to help investors understand our underlying performance. Core operating income from continuing operations was USD 16.6 billion (+8%, +6% cc) benefiting from higher sales, partly offset by increased M&S and R&D investments. Core operating income margin was 32.1% of net sales, increasing by 0.4 percentage points (+0.5 percentage points cc). Core net income was USD 14.1 billion (+7%, +5% cc). Core EPS was USD 6.29 (+9%, +7% cc), growing faster than core net income and benefiting from lower weighted average number of shares outstanding. 1 For further information, see \"Item 18.

The highest growth coming from Promacta /Revolade , followed by Jakavi +4% cc) sales grew due to a solid performance in the US and Emerging Growth Item 5. Operating and Financial Review and Prospects 58Markets, partly offset by a decline seen in Europe and Japan. Promacta/Revolade (USD 2.0 billion, +16%, +15% cc) grew across all regions, driven by increased use in chronic immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) and as first-line treatment for severe aplastic anemia (SAA) in the US. In the first quarter, the US prescribing information was updated to include \"persistent\" ITP, per clinical treatment guidelines. Jakavi (USD 1.6 billion, +19%, +16% cc) growth was driven by strong demand in the myelofibrosis and poly- cythemia vera indications. Data readouts from (REACH2 and REACH3) showed Jakavi sig- nificantly improved with steroid-re - sistant/dependent graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) compared to best available therapy. Regulatory filings are under review and approvals are expected in 2022. Gleevec/Glivec (USD 1.0 billion, -14%, -15% cc) declined due to increased generic competition. Kymriah (USD 587 million, +24%, +22% cc) grew strongly in all regions. Coverage continued to expand, with more than 350 qualified treatment centers and 30 countries having coverage for at least one indication. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted regen - erative medicine advanced therapy designation and orphan drug status for Kymriah in follicular lymphoma. At the interim analysis, the Phase II ELARA trial in patients with relapsed or refractory follicular lymphoma met its primary endpoint of complete response rate. Manufac - turing for Kymriah was expanded through regulatory approvals in Switzerland, France and Japan. Exjade/Jadenu (USD 563 million, -14%, -16% cc) declined mainly due to pressure from generic competi - tion in all regions. Adakveo (USD 164 million, +56%, +56% cc) world - wide launch continued to progress well, with continuous double-digit growth in cumulative patients in the US in 2021, despite COVID-19 challenges. In the US, more than 95% of insured lives have a payer coverage policy in place across Medicaid, Medicare, and Commercial seg - ments. In the UK, NICE recommendation was received in October 2021. Solid Tumor Sales in the Solid Tumor franchise reached USD 7.1 bil - lion (+3%, +2% cc), of which Tafinlar + Mekinist delivered USD 1.7 billion, Sandostatin USD 1.4 billion, Afinitor / Votubia USD 0.9 billion and Kisqali USD 0.9 billion. The highest growth coming from Kisqali , followed by Tafinlar + Mekinist Votrient and other mature Mekinist (USD 1.7 billion, +10%, +8% cc), the worldwide targeted therapy leader in BRAF/MEK-inhibi - tion, continued to deliver strong growth driven by demand in both BRAF+ adjuvant / metastatic melanoma and BRAF+ advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Tafinlar + Mekinist is the first and only targeted therapy to achieve both five-year overall survival (OS) in meta - static melanoma and five-year relapse-free survival (RFS) melanoma. Sandostatin (USD 1.4 billion, -2%, -3% cc) sales declined due to ongoing competitive pressure in Europe and Japan. Afinitor /Votubia (USD 938 million, -13%, -14% cc) declined due to generic competition in the US, Europe and Emerging Growth Markets. In the US, generic com - petition for the 10 mg and disperse formulation entered in October 2021. Kisqali (USD 937 million, +36%, +36% cc) sales grew across all geographies driven by the longest overall sur - vival benefit ever reported in HR+/HER2- advanced breast cancer. New overall survival data presented at The San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium provide fur - ther evidence of the Kisqali unique benefit across the most common intrinsic subtypes, including HER2-en - riched subtype, suggesting that Kisqali re-sensitizes ET-resistent tumors to hormonal therapy and support - ing the scientific rationale for the Phase III HARMONIA trial comparing Kisqali to palbociclib. Kisqali is approved in 96 countries. Votrient (USD 577 million, -9%, -10% cc) declined due to increased competition in the US, Europe and Japan. Lutathera (USD 475 million, +7%, +6% cc) sales grew in all the regions. There are 450 centers now actively treating patients globally. Sales from all AAA brands (including Lutathera and radiopharmaceutical diagnos - tic products) were USD 717 million. Piqray (USD 329 million, +3%, +3% cc) grew in Europe and Emerging Growth Markets, partially offset by a decline in the US. Piqray in combination with fulvestrant received European Commission (EC) approval to treat HR+/HER2- advanced breast cancer with a PIK3CA mutation. Piqray is the first and only therapy specifically for the approximately 40% of HR+/HER2- advanced breast cancer patients who have a PIK3CA mutation, which is associated with poor prognosis. Piqray is approved in more than 60 countries. Tabrecta (USD 90 million, +157%, +155% cc) US launch continues to progress well. All leading lung can - cer institutions have started patients on treatment with more than 1,000 unique prescribers LTD and Tabrecta maintains its strong position as the number one pre - scribed MET inhibitor for NSCLC in the US. Tabrecta is the first and only therapy approved by the FDA to spe - cifically target metastatic NSCLC with a mutation that leads to MET exon 14 skipping (METex14), as detected by an FDA-approved test using tissue and blood. Tabrecta is approved in nine countries. Novartis Pharmaceuticals business unit Immunology, Hepatology and Dermatology Sales in the Immunology, Hepatology franchise reached USD 5.8 billion (+19%, +18% cc), of which Cosentyx delivered USD 4.7 billion. Cosentyx (USD 4.7 billion, +18%, +17% cc) saw strong growth driven by sustained underlying demand across indications in the US and Europe and volume growth in China following National Reimbursement Drug List (NRDL) listing in the first quarter of 2021. In 2021, Novartis received an EU label update for Cosentyx to include effi - cacy data on axial manifestations in patients with psori - atic arthritis, based upon data from the MAXIMISE trial. Cosentyx received approval in the US and China for mod - erate to severe plaque psoriasis in pediatric patients aged six years and older. Cosentyx also received US Item 5. Operating and Financial Review and Prospects 59approval for the treatment of active enthesitis-related arthritis (ERA) in patients aged four years and older, and active juvenile psoriatic arthritis (JPsA) in patients aged two years and older. Two hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) Phase III studies (SUNRISE and SUNSHINE) met their primary endpoint, with more patients treated with Cosentyx achieving an HS Clinical Response (HiSCR), compared with placebo, at week 16. Ilaris (USD 1.1 billion, +21%, +22% cc) strong sales were driven by continued growth across all regions. Con - tributors to continuing growth include launch of adult-on - set Still's disease, the other adult rheumatology indica - tions in the US and Periodic Fever Syndromes (PFS) indications in Europe. Neuroscience Sales in the Neuroscience franchise were USD 5.1 billion (+17%, +15% cc), mainly driven by the sales growth of Kesimpta and Zolgensma , partly offset by sales decline . Gilenya (USD 2.8 billion, -7%, -9% cc) sales declined due to increased competition. Zolgensma (USD 1.4 billion, +47%, +46% cc) access continued to expand globally throughout 2021. Zolgensma had a strong fourth quarter with year-over-year growth driven by expanding access in Europe and Emerging Growth Markets, combined with steady US sales. Zolgensma is now approved in 42 countries. Kesimpta (USD 372 million) sales were driven by strong access and increased demand. To initiate access, Kesimpta is being provided free of charge for US patients who are eligible for reimbursement until they are covered by their insurance. The share of free goods is decreas - ing as reimbursement progresses. In March, Kesimpta received EC approval. Kesimpta is now approved in 64 countries. Mayzent (USD 281 million, +65%, +65% cc) contin - ued to grow, driven by fulfilling an important unmet need in multiple sclerosis (MS) patients showing signs of pro - gression despite being on other treatments. Mayzent is the first and only oral disease modifying therapy (DMT) studied and proven to delay disease progression in a broad secondary progressive multiple sclerosis (SPMS) patient population. Mayzent is now approved in 67 coun - tries. Aimovig (USD 215 million, cc). Effective January 1, 2022, Novartis and Amgen reached an agreement to settle all remaining claims in the litigation between the companies. Novartis returns its Aimovig US rights to Amgen, which is now exclusively commercializing Aimovig in the US. Novartis' ex-US rights remain unaffected and Novartis will continue to commer - cialize Aimovig in the rest of the world, with the excep - tion of Japan. Amgen will no longer pay royalties to Novartis on sales of Aimovig in the United States, and the parties' cost sharing for commercialization of Aimovig in the United States ceases. The parties will continue to share development expenses worldwide in accordance with the relevant agreements. Other terms of the settle - ment are confidential. Aimovig has been prescribed to over 620,000 patients worldwide in the post-trial setting. See also \"Item 18. Financial Statements\u2014Note 20. Pro - visions and other non-current liabilities.\"Ophthalmology Sales in the Ophthalmology franchise were USD 4.3 bil - lion (-2%, -4% cc). Lucentis (USD 2.2 billion, +12%, +8% cc) sales growth was driven by Europe and Emerging Growth Markets, partly offset by decline in Japan. Xiidra (USD 468 million, +24%, +24% cc) showed dou - ble-digit growth, driven by a solid and sustainable increased brand awareness among diagnosed patients suffering from signs and symptoms of dry eye disease and a lower prior year base due to COVID-19. Beovu (USD 186 million, -2%, -3% cc) sales declined in the US partly offset by growth in other markets versus prior year following continued geographic expansion. Beovu is now approved in 73 countries. Other Ophthalmology products declined due to generic impacts in the US, primarily for Travatan and Ciprodex . Cardiovascular, Renal and Metabolism Sales in the Cardiovascular, Renal and Metabolism fran - chise were USD 3.6 billion (USD 3.5 billion, +42%, +40% cc) sustained strong growth with increased patient share across mar - kets, driven by demand as the essential first-choice ther - apy for heart failure patients (with reduced ejection frac - tion). Sales in the US continue to benefit from FDA approval in February of an expanded indication in patients with left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) below nor - mal, making Entresto the first therapy indicated for heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) and most heart failure patients with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). The European Society of Cardiology heart fail - ure guidelines and the American College of Cardiology Expert Consensus Decision Pathway recommend Entresto as first-line heart failure therapy. In China, Entresto has been listed in the National Reimbursement Drug List (NRDL) for both HFrEF and hypertension, effective January 2022. Leqvio (USD 12 million) is the first and only small-in - terfering RNA therapy to reduce LDL cholesterol, a risk factor for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), which is caused by plaque buildup in the arter - ies. Leqvio is administered by a healthcare professional twice a year as an injection, following an initial dose and a dose at three months. On December 22, 2021, it was approved in the US to treat adults with clinical ASCVD or heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HeFH), as an adjunct to diet and maximally tolerated statin ther - apy, who require additional lowering of LDL cholesterol. In the EU and other countries, it is approved to treat adults with primary hypercholesterolemia (heterozygous familial and non-familial) or mixed dyslipidemia. It is used in combination with a statin or a statin with other lip - id-lowering therapies in patients unable to reach LDL cholesterol goals with the maximum tolerated dose of a statin, or alone or in combination with other lipid-lower - ing therapies in patients who are statin-intolerant or for whom a statin is contraindicated. Respiratory and Allergy Sales in the Respiratory and Allergy franchise were USD 2.1 billion (+9%, +6% cc), of which Xolair delivered USD 1.4 billion.Item 5. Operating and Financial Review and Prospects 60Xolair (USD 1.4 billion, +14%, +12% cc) continued growth, mainly driven by the chronic spontaneous urti - caria (CSU) and severe allergic asthma (SAA) indica - tions. The indication of nasal polyps has been approved and currently launched in the US, Germany, Canada and several other countries. In April 2021 the FDA approved Xolair for self-injection; this formulation in the US in the second quarter of 2021. Novartis co-promotes Xolair with Genentech in the US and shares a portion of operating income, but does not record any US sales. Ultibro Group (USD 584 million, -6%, -10% cc) sales declined mainly in Europe due to Ultibro Group consists Breezhaler . Established Medicines The Established Medicines franchise had sales of USD 5.7 billion (-9%, -10% cc).Galvus Group (USD 1.1 billion, -9%, -8% cc) declined across all regions, mainly in Emerging Growth Markets due to generic competition and in Japan due to the exclu - sive promotion agreement. Exforge Group (USD 901 million, -8%, -11% cc) declined mainly due to generic competition and the impact of Volume-Based procurement in China. Diovan Group (USD 773 million, -23%, -25% cc) declined mainly due to generic competition and the impact of Volume- Based procurement in China. Zortress/Certican (USD 431 million, -5%, -6% cc) declined mainly due to generic competition in the US. Voltaren/Cataflam (USD 373 million, +4%, +3% cc) grew in Emerging Growth Markets, partially offset by decline in Europe and Japan. Neoral/Sandimmun(e) (USD 368 million, -6%, -8% cc) declined across all markets mainly due to generic competition. Sandoz Net sales were USD 9.6 billion (0%, -2% cc). Volume increased by 7 percentage points from growth in Bio - pharmaceuticals and 1 percentage point relating to con - tract manufacturing revenue reclassification, partly off - set by the impact of softer Retail demand, with a weak cough and cold season in the first half. Volume growth was more than offset by a negative price effect of 9 per - centage points mainly due to increasing competition and the impact of prior year off-contract sales in the US. We continue to see an impact of COVID-19, particularly for the Retail Generics and third-party Anti-Infectives busi - nesses. However, the effects have been more moderate in recent months and the Sandoz business is continuing to normalize. Sales in Europe were USD 5.3 billion (+1%, -2% cc), in the US USD 1.8 billion (-15%), in Asia / Africa / Austral - asia USD 1.7 billion (+11%, +9% cc) and in Canada and Latin America USD 872 million (+13%, +10% cc). Sales in Europe declined due to the impact of COVID-19 on the Retail Generics business. The sales decline in the US was due to the negative price effect in the Retail Gener - ics business, especially oral solids, which were addition - ally impacted by partnership terminations, as well as prior year Biopharmaceuticals off-contract sales.

Retail sales were USD 7.1 billion (-2%, -4% cc), declin - ing due to the above-mentioned factors. Biopharmaceuticals In Biopharmaceuticals, Sandoz develops, manufactures and markets protein- and other biotechnology-based products, including biosimilars, and provides biotechnol - ogy manufacturing services to other companies. The Biopharmaceuticals business also includes Glatopa , a generic version of Copaxone\u00ae, which treats relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis and is marketed in the US. Global sales of Biopharmaceuticals (biosimilars, bio - pharmaceutical contract manufacturing and Glatopa ) grew to USD 2.1 billion (+10%, +7% cc), driven by contin - ued growth outside the US and Ziextenzo (pegfilgrastim) US. Anti-Infectives In Anti-Infectives, Sandoz manufactures and supplies active pharmaceutical ingredients and intermediates, mainly antibiotics, for internal use by Retail Generics and for sale to third-party customers. Total Anti-Infectives franchise sales were USD 1.1 bil - lion (-3%, -5% cc) impacted by softer retail demand. These sales were including finished dosage forms sold under the Sandoz name (USD 707 million, 2%, 0% cc) and Anti-Infectives sold to third-parties for sale under their own name (USD 423 million, -11%, -12% cc). On October 26, 2021, Novartis has announced that it will commence a strategic review of the Sandoz Division. The review will explore all options, ranging from retaining the business to separation, in order to determine how to best maximize value for our shareholders.Item 5.

This increase was mainly due to the gain of USD 14.6 billion recognized on the divestment of our investment in Roche. As a result of the decision to divest our investment in Roche, the Group discontinued the recognition of its share of income of Roche from November 3, 2021. Excluding the divestment gain from our investment in Roche, income from associated companies increased to USD 783 million, compared to USD 673 million in prior year, mainly due to the increase in the share of income from Roche. The estimated income for Roche through November 3, 2021, net of amortization, was USD 745 mil - lion compared to USD 741 million in prior full year period. A positive prior year true up of USD 40 million has been recognized in the first quarter of 2021, compared to a negative true up of USD 64 million in the first quarter of 2020. Interest expense and other financial income and expense Interest expense decreased to USD 811 million from USD 869 million in prior year, mainly due to lower interest expense on financial debts. Other financial income and expense amounted to a net expense of USD 80 million in line with a net expense of USD 78 million in the prior year. Income taxes The tax rate was 8.1% compared to 18.3% in the prior year. In the current year, the tax rate decreased due to the impact of the divestment gain recognized on the sale of our investment in Roche, partially offset by uncertain tax positions and prior year items. The prior year tax rate was impacted by the effect of non-deductible legal charges and uncertain tax positions. Excluding these impacts, the rate would have been 15.7% compared to 15.6% in the prior year. The increase from prior year was mainly the result of a change in profit mix. Net income Net income was USD 24.0 billion, benefiting from the USD 14.6 billion gain from the divestment of our invest - ment in Roche.

The increase from prior year was mainly the result of a change in profit mix. Core net income Core net income was USD 14.1 billion (+7%, +5% cc). Core earnings per share Core EPS was USD 6.29 (+9%, +7% cc), growing faster than core net income and benefiting from lower weighted average number of shares outstanding. 1 For an explanation of non-IFRS measures and reconciliation tables, see \"\u2014Non-IFRS measures as defined by Novartis.\"Item 5. Operating and Financial Review and Prospects 65 Factors affecting comparability of year-on-year results of operations Significant transactions in 2021 and 2020 The comparability of the year-on-year results of our operations for the total Group can be significantly affected by acquisitions and divestments. As part of our long-term strategy to focus Novartis as a leading medicines company, we announced and/or completed several acquisitions and divestments during 2021 and 2020. A detailed description of significant transactions in 2021 and 2020, can be found in \"Item 18. Financial State - ments\u2014Note 2. Significant transactions.\" Internal control over financial reporting The Group's management has assessed the effective - ness of internal control over financial reporting. The Group's independent statutory auditor also issued an opinion on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Both the Group's management and its external auditors concluded that the Group main - tained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021. For more details, see \"Item 15. Controls and Procedures.\" Approach to risk management See \"Item 6. Directors, Senior Management and Employ - ees\u2014Item 6.C Board practices\u2014Corporate gover - nance\u2014Information -ment\" and \"Item 18. Financial Statements\u2014Note 29. Financial instruments - additional disclosures.\" Non-IFRS measures as defined by Novartis Novartis uses certain non-IFRS metrics when measur - ing performance, especially when measuring cur - rent-year results against prior periods, including core results, constant currencies, free cash flow and net debt. Despite the use of these measures by management in setting goals and measuring the Group's performance, these are non-IFRS measures that have no standardized meaning prescribed by IFRS. As a result, such measures have limits in their usefulness to investors. Because of their non-standardized definitions, the non-IFRS measures (unlike IFRS measures) may not be comparable to the calculation of similar measures of other companies. These non-IFRS measures are pre - sented solely to permit investors to more fully understand how the Group's management assesses underlying per - formance. These non-IFRS measures are not, and should not be viewed as, a substitute for IFRS measures, and should be viewed in conjunction with IFRS financials. As an internal measure of Group performance, these non-IFRS measures have limitations, and the Group's performance management process is not solely restricted to these metrics.Item 5. Operating and Financial Review and Prospects 66Core results The Group's core results - including core operating income, core net income and core earnings per share - exclude fully the amortization and impairment charges of intangible assets, excluding software, net gains and losses on fund investments and equity securities valued at fair value through profit and loss, and certain acquisi - tion- and divestment-related items. The following items that exceed a threshold of USD 25 million are also excluded: integration- and divestment-related income and expenses; divestment items; legal-related items; impairments of property, plant and equipment, and financial assets, and income and expense items that management deems exceptional and that are or are expected to accumulate within the year to be over a USD 25 million threshold. Novartis believes that investor understanding of the Group's performance is enhanced by disclosing core measures of performance since, core measures exclude items that can vary significantly from year to year, they enable better comparison of business performance across years. For this same reason, Novartis uses these core measures in addition to IFRS and other measures as important factors in assessing the Group's perfor - mance. The following are examples of how these core measures are utilized: In addition to monthly reports containing financial infor - mation prepared under International Financial Report - ing Standards (IFRS), senior management receives a monthly analysis incorporating these core measures. Annual budgets are prepared for both IFRS and core measures. As an internal measure of Group performance, the core results measures have limitations, and the Group's per - formance management process is not solely restricted to these metrics. A limitation of the core results mea - sures is that they provide a view of the Group's opera - tions without including all events during a period, such as the effects of an acquisition, divestment, or amortiza - tion/impairments of purchased intangible assets, impair - ments to property, plant and equipment and restructur - ings and related items. Constant currencies Changes in the relative values of non-US currencies to the US dollar can affect the Group's financial results and financial position. To provide additional information that may be useful to investors, including changes in sales volume, we present information about our net sales and various values relating to operating and net income that are adjusted for such foreign currency effects.Constant currency calculations have the goal of elim - inating two exchange rate effects so that an estimate can be made of underlying changes in the consolidated income statement excluding the impact of fluctuations in exchanges rates: The impact of translating the income statements of con - solidated entities from their non-USD functional cur - rencies to USD The impact of exchange rate movements on the major transactions of consolidated entities performed in cur - rencies other than their functional currency. We calculate constant currency measures by translating the current year's foreign currency values for sales and other income statement items into USD, using the aver - age exchange rates from the prior year and comparing them to the prior year values in USD. We use these constant currency measures in evalu - ating the Group's performance, since they may assist us in evaluating our ongoing performance from year to year. However, in performing our evaluation, we also consider equivalent measures of performance that are not affected by changes in the relative value of currencies. Growth rate calculation For ease of understanding, Novartis uses a sign conven - tion for its growth rates such that a reduction in operat - ing expenses or losses compared to the prior year is shown as a positive growth. Free cash flow Novartis defines free cash flow as net cash flows from operating activities and cash flows from investing activ - ities associated with purchases and sales of property, plant and equipment, of intangible assets, of financial assets and of other non-current assets. Excluded from free cash flow are cash flows from investing activities associated with acquisitions and divestments of busi - nesses and of interests in associated companies, pur - chases and sales of marketable securities, commodities, time deposits and net cash flows from financing activi - ties. Free cash flow is a non-IFRS measure and is not intended to be a substitute measure for net cash flows from operating activities as determined under IFRS. Free cash flow is presented as additional information because management believes it is a useful supplemental indica - tor of the Group's ability to operate without reliance on additional borrowing or use of existing cash. Free cash flow is a measure of the net cash generated that is avail - able for investment in strategic opportunities, returning to shareholders and for debt repayment. Free cash flow is a non-IFRS measure, which means it should not be interpreted as a measure determined under IFRS. Item 5. Operating and Financial Review and Prospects 67Net debt Novartis calculates net debt as current financial debts and derivative financial instruments plus non-current financial debt less cash and cash equivalents and mar - ketable securities, commodities, time deposits and deriv - ative financial instruments. Net debt is a non-IFRS measure, which means it should not be interpreted as a measure determined under IFRS. Net debt is presented as additional informa - tion because management believes it is a useful supple - mental indicator of the Group's ability to pay dividends, to meet financial commitments, and to invest in new stra - tegic opportunities, including strengthening its balance sheet.

Generally, this results in amortization and impairment of intangible assets and acquisition-related restructuring and integration items having a full tax impact. There is usually a tax impact on other items, although this is not always the case for items arising from legal settlements in certain jurisdictions. Adjustments related to income from associated companies are recorded net of any related tax effect. Due to these factors and the differing effective tax rates in the various jurisdictions, the tax on the total adjustments of USD 9.4 billion to arrive at the core results before tax amounts to USD 516 million. Excluding the gain on the divestment of our investment in Roche, the tax on the total adjustments of USD 5.2 billion to arrive at the core results before tax amounts to USD 516 million and the average tax rate on the adjustments was 10.0%. 6 Earnings per share (EPS) is calculated on the amount of net income attributable to shareholders of Novartis AG.Item 5.

This increase was mainly driven by higher net income adjusted for non-cash items and other adjustments, including divestment gains, and lower payments out of provisions, mainly due to legal matters in the prior year. This was partly offset by unfavorable hedging results. Net cash inflows from investing activities from con - tinuing operations amounted to USD 4.2 billion, com - pared to net cash outflows of USD 13.1 billion in 2020. The current year cash inflows were driven by pro - ceeds of USD 20.7 billion from the divestment of our investment in Roche; USD 2.3 billion from the sale of mar - ketable securities, commodities and time deposits; and USD 1.4 billion from the sale of intangible assets, finan - cial assets and property, plant and equipment. These cash inflows were partly offset by USD 16.4 billion cash outflows for purchases of marketable securities and time deposits, mainly due to the investment of a portion of the proceeds from the divestment of our investment in Roche; USD 1.6 billion for purchases of intangible assets (including the upfront payment to in-license tislelizumab from an affiliate of BeiGene, Ltd); USD 1.4 billion for pur - chases of property, plant and equipment; USD 0.6 billion for acquisitions and divestments of businesses, net (including the acquisition of GSK's cephalosporin anti - biotics business for USD 351 million); and USD 0.2 billion for purchases of financial assets. In 2020, net cash outflows used in investing activi - ties from continuing operations of USD 13.1 billion were mainly driven by USD 10.0 billion for acquisitions and divestments of businesses, net (including the acquisition of The Medicines Company for USD 9.5 billion, net of cash acquired USD 0.1 billion, and the acquisition of the Japanese business of Aspen Global Incorporated for USD 0.3 billion); USD 1.4 billion for net purchases of mar - ketable securities, commodities and time deposits; USD 1.3 billion for purchases of property, plant and equipment; and USD 1.3 billion for purchases of intangible assets. These cash outflows were partly offset by cash inflows of USD 0.7 billion from the sale of financial assets (includ - ing USD 0.3 billion proceeds from the sale of Alcon Inc. shares) and USD 0.4 billion from the sale of intangible assets. Net cash outflows used in financing activities from continuing operations amounted to USD 16.3 billion, compared to USD 2.2 billion in 2020. The current year cash outflows were driven by USD 7.4 billion for the dividend payment; USD 3.0 billion for net treasury share transactions; USD 3.5 billion net decrease in current financial debts; and USD 2.2 billion for the repayment of two bonds denominated in euro (notional amount of EUR 1.25 billion and of EUR 0.6 bil - lion) at maturity. Payments of lease liabilities and other financing cash flows resulted in a net cash outflow of USD 0.2 billion. In 2020, net cash outflows used in financing activi - ties from continuing operations of USD 2.2 billion were driven by USD 7.0 billion for the dividend payment; USD 2.1 billion for net treasury share transactions; USD 2.0 billion for the repayment of two US dollar bonds at matu - rity; USD 0.3 billion net payments for lease liabilities; and USD 0.2 billion for other financing cash outflows, net. These cash outflows were partly offset by cash inflows of USD 7.1 billion from the increase in non-current finan - cial debts, mainly consisting of USD 4.9 billion from the issuance of bonds denominated in US dollars (notional amount of USD 5.0 billion) and USD 2.1 billion from the issuance of a sustainability-linked bond denominated in euro (notional amount of EUR 1.85 billion); and USD 2.3 billion from the net increase in current financial debts.Item 5.

See \"Item 18. Financial Statements-Note 2. Significant transactions-Significant transactions in 2019.\" Financial year 2021 compared to 2020 Free cash flow amounted to USD 13.3 billion (+14% USD), compared to USD 11.7 billion in 2020. This increase was mainly driven by higher operating income adjusted for non-cash items and other adjustments, and lower payments out of provisions, mainly due to legal matters in the prior year, partly offset by USD 650 million upfront payment to in-license tislelizumab from an affiliate of BeiGene, Ltd.Item 5.

Financial Statements- Note 12. Deferred tax assets and liabilities.\" Assets Total non-current assets of USD 86.1 billion at Decem - ber 31, 2021, decreased by USD 12.0 billion compared to December 31, 2020. Intangible assets other than goodwill decreased by USD 2.6 billion as net additions (including the in-licens - ing of tislelizumab from an affiliate of BeiGene, Ltd) and acquisitions were more than offset by amortization, unfa - vorable currency translation adjustments and impair - ments. Goodwill decreased by USD 0.4 billion, mainly due to unfavorable currency translation adjustments, only par - tially offset by additions. Property, plant and equipment decreased by USD 0.7 billion, as net additions were more than offset by depre - ciation, unfavorable currency translation adjustments and net impairments. Investments in associated companies decreased by USD 9.4 billion mainly due to the divestment of our invest - ment in Roche. These decreases were partly offset by an increase in financial and other non-current assets of USD 1.5 bil - lion, driven by an increase in the prepaid post-employ-ment benefit plans of USD 1.2 billion, resulting from actu - arial gains primarily from valuation impact on plan assets and changes in the discount rates used to calculate the actuarial defined benefit obligations. Right-of-use assets and deferred tax assets were broadly in line with December 31, 2020. Total current assets of USD 45.7 billion at December 31, 2021, increased by USD 16.0 billion compared to December 31, 2020. Cash and cash equivalents increased by USD 2.7 bil - lion and marketable securities, commodities, time depos - its and derivative financial instruments increased by USD 14.0 billion, mainly driven by the cash generated through operating activities and the proceeds of USD 20.7 billion from the divestment of our investment in Roche, partially offset by the dividend payment, the purchase of treasury shares and the repayment of a financial debt. Item 5. Operating and Financial Review and Prospects 78Inventories, trade receivables and other current assets and income tax receivables were broadly in line with December 31, 2020. We consider our provisions for doubtful trade receiv - ables to be adequate. We continue to monitor the level of trade receivables, particularly in Argentina, Brazil, Greece, Italy, Portugal, Russia, Spain and Turkey. Should there be a substantial deterioration in our economic exposure with respect to those countries, we may change the terms of trade on which we operate. The gross trade receivables from these countries at December 31, 2021, amounted to USD 1.3 billion (2020: USD 1.5 billion), of which USD 27 million is past due for more than one year (2020: USD 55 million), and for which provisions of USD 24 million have been recorded (2020: USD 27 mil - lion). At December 31, 2021, amounts past due for more than one year were not significant in any of these coun - tries on a standalone basis. The majority of the outstand - ing trade receivables from Portugal, Spain and Greece are due directly from local governments or govern - ment-funded entities. For a table showing an overview of the aging analy- sis of total trade receivables and the total amount of the provision for doubtful trade receivables as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, see \"Item 18. Financial Statements\u2014Note 15. Trade receivables.\" There is also a risk that certain countries could devalue their currency. Currency exposures are described in more detail in \"\u2014Effects of currency fluctu - ations.\" Liabilities Total non-current liabilities of USD 33.8 billion decreased by USD 4.3 billion compared to December 31, 2020. Non-current fi nancial debts decreased by USD 3.4 billion mainly due to the reclassification of USD 2.6 bil - lion from non-current to current financial debts, primar - ily two USD denominated bonds with notional amounts of USD 1.0 billion and USD 1.5 billion maturing in 2022, and favorable currency translation adjustments of USD 0.8 billion. Provisions and other non-current liabilities decreased by USD 0.8 billion, primarily due to a USD 0.9 billion decrease in accrued liabilities for defined benefit pen - sion plans mainly due to actuarial gains primarily from valuation impact on plan assets and the changes in dis - count rates used to calculate the actuarial defined ben - efit obligations. Non-current lease liabilities and deferred tax liabili - ties were broadly in line with December 31, 2020. Total current liabilities of USD 30.2 billion decreased by USD 2.9 billion compared to December 31, 2020.Provisions and other current liabilities and current income tax liabilities increased by USD 0.5 billion mainly due to an increase in the treasury share repurchase obli - gation of USD 1.0 billion, which was partially offset by a decrease of USD 0.4 billion in other current provisions. Current fi nancial debts and derivative fi nancial instru - ments decreased by USD 3.5 billion mainly due to the repayment of a USD 1.5 billion bond denominated in euro (notional amount of EUR 1.25 billion) and USD 0.7 billion bond denominated in euro (notional amount of EUR 0.6 billion) at maturity, repayments of current financial debts of USD 3.5 billion and favorable currency translation adjustments of USD 0.3 billion, partly offset by the reclas - sification from non-current to current financial debts of USD 2.6 billion. Current lease liabilities and trade payables were broadly in line with December 31, 2020. In our key countries, Switzerland and the United States, assessments have been agreed by the tax author - ities up to 2016 in Switzerland and up to 2014 in the United States, with the exception of one open United States position related to the 2007 tax filing. In addition, a subsidiary in France, acquired with the AAA acquisi - tion, has an open position related to the tax years 2014 and 2015. Uncertainties also exist on the application of a taxing right based on a German non-resident tax reg - ulation for specific revenues derived from German reg - istered intellectual property rights. Novartis believes that its total provisions are ade - quate based upon currently available information. How - ever, given the inherent difficulties in estimating liabilities in this area, Novartis may incur additional costs beyond the amounts provided. Management believes that such additional amounts, if any, would not be material to the Group's financial condition but could be material to the results of operations or cash flows in a given period. Equity The Group`s equity increased by USD 11.2 billion to USD 67.8 billion at December 31, 2021, compared to Decem - ber 31, 2020. This increase was mainly due to the net income of USD 24.0 billion, net actuarial gains of USD 1.8 billion, equity-based compensation of USD 0.7 billion and the net favorable fair value adjustments on financial instru - ments of USD 0.2 billion. This was partially offset by the cash-dividend pay - ment of USD 7.4 billion, purchases of treasury shares of USD 2.9 billion, the increase of the treasury share repur - chase obligation of USD 1.0 billion and unfavorable cur - rency translation differences of USD 4.8 billion.

Significant accounting policies\"). In 2021, Novartis repurchased a total of 30.7 million shares for USD 2.8 billion on the SIX Swiss Exchange second trading line, including 19.6 million shares (USD 1.8 billion) under the up-to USD 2.5 billion share buyback announced in November 2020, 8.6 million shares (USD 0.8 billion) to mitigate dilution related to participation plans of employees and 2.5 million shares (USD 0.2 bil - lion) under the up-to USD 15 billion share buyback announced in December 2021. In addition, 1.5 million shares (USD 0.1 billion) were repurchased from employ-ees. In the same period, 10.3 million shares (for an equity value of USD 0.8 billion) were delivered as a result of options exercised and share deliveries related to partic - ipation plans of employees. Consequently, the total num - ber of shares outstanding decreased by 21.9 million ver - sus December 31, 2020. These treasury share transactions resulted in a decrease in equity of USD 2.1 billion and a net cash outflow of USD 3.0 billion. In 2020, Novartis repurchased a total of 32.6 million shares for USD 2.9 billion on the SIX Swiss Exchange second trading line, including 8.0 million shares (USD 0.7 billion) bought back under the up-to USD 2.5 billion share buyback announced in November 2020, and 24.6 million shares (USD 2.2 billion) to mitigate dilution related to par -ticipation plans of employees. In addition, 1.7 million shares (USD 0.2 billion) were repurchased from employ-ees. In the same period, 26.1 million shares (for an equity value of USD 1.5 billion) were delivered as a result of options exercised and share deliveries related to partic - ipation plans of employees. Consequently, the total num - ber of shares outstanding decreased by 8.2 million ver - sus December 31, 2019. These treasury share transactions resulted in a decrease in equity of USD 1.6 billion and a net cash outflow of USD 2.1 billion including the benefit from net option proceeds. T reasury shares At December 31, 2021, our holding of treasury shares amounted to 199.5 million shares, or approximately 8% of the total number of issued shares. Approximately 102.5 million treasury shares were held in entities that restrict their availability for use. At December 31, 2020, our holding of treasury shares amounted to 210.2 million shares, or approximately 9% of the total number of issued shares. Approximately 103.0 million treasury shares were held in entities that restrict their availability for use.Item 5. Operating and Financial Review and Prospects 80Effects of currency fluctuations We transact our business in many currencies other than the US dollar, our reporting currency. The following table provides an overview of net sales and operating expenses for our continuing operations based on IFRS values for 2021 and 2020, for currencies most important to the Group: 2021 2020 Operating Operating Net sales expenses Net sales expenses Currency % % 1 % % 1 US dollar (USD) 35 35 36 34 Euro (EUR) 29 26 29 27 Swiss franc (CHF) 2 18 2 18 Chinese yuan (CNY) 6 3 5 3 Japanese yen (JPY) 5 3 6 3 Canadian dollar (CAD) 3 2 3 1 British pound (GBP) 3 2 2 3 Russian ruble (RUB) 2 1 2 1 Brazilian real (BRL) 1 1 2 1 Australian dollar (AUD) 1 1 1 1 Other currencies 13 8 12 8 1 Operating expenses include cost of goods sold; selling, general and administration; research and development; other income and other expense. We prepare our consolidated financial statements in US dollars. As a result, fluctuations in the exchange rates between the US dollar and other currencies can have a significant effect on both the Group's results of opera - tions as well as the reported value of our assets, liabili - ties and cash flows. This in turn may significantly affect reported earnings (both positively and negatively) and the comparability of period-to-period results of opera - tions. For purposes of our consolidated balance sheets, we translate assets and liabilities denominated in other cur - rencies into US dollars at the prevailing market exchange rates as of the relevant balance sheet date. For purposes of the Group's consolidated income and cash flow state - ments, revenue, expense and cash flow items in local currencies are translated into US dollars at average exchange rates prevailing during the relevant period. As a result, even if the amounts or values of these items remain unchanged in the respective local currency, changes in exchange rates have an impact on the amounts or values of these items in our consolidated financial statements. Because our expenditure in Swiss francs is signifi - cantly higher than our revenue in Swiss francs, volatility in the value of the Swiss franc can have a significant impact on the reported value of our earnings, assets and liabilities, and the timing and extent of such volatility can be difficult to predict. The Group manages its global currency exposure by engaging in hedging transactions where management deems appropriate, after taking into account the natural hedging afforded by our global business activity. In 2021 and 2020, we entered into various contracts that change in value with movements in foreign exchange rates, to preserve the value of assets, commitments and expected transactions. We use forward contracts and foreign cur - rency options to hedge. For more information on how these transactions affect our consolidated financial statements and on how foreign exchange rate exposure is managed, see \"Item 18. Financial Statements\u2014Note 1.

Total financial debts amounted to USD 29.2 billion at December 31, 2021, compared to USD 36.0 billion at December 31, 2020. Non-current fi nancial debts decreased by USD 3.4 billion mainly due to the reclassi - fication of USD 2.6 billion from non-current to current financial debts, primarily two USD denominated bonds with notional amounts of USD 1.0 billion and USD 1.5 bil - lion maturing in 2022, and favorable currency translation adjustments of USD 0.8 billion. Current fi nancial debts and derivative fi nancial instru - ments decreased by USD 3.5 billion mainly due to the repayment of a USD 1.5 billion bond denominated in euro (notional amount of EUR 1.25 billion) and USD 0.7 billion bond denominated in euro (notional amount of EUR 0.6 billion) at maturity, repayments of current financial debts of USD 3.5 billion and favorable currency translation adjustments of USD 0.3 billion, partly offset by the reclas - sification from non-current to current financial debts of USD 2.6 billion. Novartis has two US commercial paper programs under which it can issue up to USD 9.0 billion in the aggregate of unsecured commercial paper notes. Novartis also has a Japanese commercial paper program under which it can issue up to JPY 150 billion (approxi - mately USD 1.3 billion) of unsecured commercial paper notes. Commercial paper notes totaling USD 0.9 billion under these three programs were outstanding as per December 31, 2021 (2020: USD 4.3 billion). Novartis also has a committed credit facility of USD 6.0 billion, which was renewed in 2019. This credit facility is provided by a syndicate of banks and is intended to be used as a backstop for the US commercial paper programs. The renewed facility matures in September 2024 and was undrawn as per December 31, 2021, and December 31, 2020. Total liquidity increased to USD 28.3 billion compared to USD 11.6 billion at December 31, 2020, mainly driven by the cash proceeds received from the divestment of our investment in Roche. As of year-end 2021, Moody's Investors Service rated the Company A1 for long-term maturities and P-1 for short-term maturities and S&P Global Ratings rated the company AA- for long-term maturities and A-1+ for short- term maturities.

In September 2020, an 8-year euro sustainabili - ty-linked bond of EUR 1.85 billion with a coupon of 0.00% was issued. Liquidity/short-term funding The Group's liquidity amounted to USD 28.3 billion at December 31, 2021, compared to USD 11.6 billion at December 31, 2020. Total non-current and current finan - cial debts, including derivatives, amounted to USD 29.2 billion at December 31, 2021, compared to USD 36.0 bil - lion at December 31, 2020. The debt/equity ratio decreased to 0.43:1 at Decem - ber 31, 2021, compared to 0.64:1 at December 31, 2020. The net debt decreased to USD 0.9 billion at December 31, 2021, compared to USD 24.5 billion at December 31, 2020, mainly driven by the USD 20.7 billion cash pro - ceeds received from the divestment of our investment in Roche. We continuously track our liquidity position and asset/liability profile. This involves modeling cash flow maturity profiles based on both historical experiences and contractual expectations to project our liquidity requirements. We seek to preserve prudent liquidity and funding capabilities. We are confident that we have suf - ficient liquidity to support our normal business activities for the foreseeable future. Certain countries have legal or economic restrictions on the ability of subsidiaries to transfer funds to the Group in the form of cash dividends, loans or advances, but these restrictions do not have an impact on the abil - ity of the Group to meet its cash obligations. We are not aware of any significant demands to change the level of liquidity needed to support our nor - mal business activities. We make use of various borrow - ing facilities provided by several financial institutions. We also successfully issued various bonds in previous years, and raised funds through our commercial paper pro - grams. The maturity schedule of our net debt can be found in \"Item 18.

Commitments and contingencies.\"Item 5. Operating and Financial Review and Prospects 855.C Research and development, patents and licenses Our research and development spending from continu - ing operations totaled USD 9.5 billion and USD 9.0 bil - lion (Core research and development USD 9.0 billion and USD 8.5 billion) for the years 2021 and 2020, respec - tively. Each of our divisions has its own research and devel - opment and patent policies. Our divisions have numer - ous products in various stages of development. For fur - ther information on these policies and these products in development, see \"Item 4. Information on the Company\u2014 Item 4.B Business overview.\" As described in the risk factors section and else - where in this Annual Report, our drug development efforts are subject to the risks and uncertainties inher -ent in any new drug development program. Due to the risks and uncertainties involved in progressing through preclinical development and clinical trials, and the time and cost involved in obtaining regulatory approvals, among other factors, we cannot reasonably estimate the timing, completion dates and costs, or range of costs, of our drug development programs, or of the development of any particular development compound (see \"Item 3. Key Information\u2014Item 3.D Risk factors\").

Information on the Company\u2014Item 4.B Business overview\" for trend information. 5.E Critical accounting estimates Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Stan - dards (IFRS) as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB). The preparation of financial statements requires management to make certain esti - mates and assumptions, either at the balance sheet date or during the year, which affect the reported amounts of revenues, expenses, assets, liabilities and contingent amounts. Our significant accounting policies that are set out in \"Item 18. Financial Statements\u2014Note 1. Significant accounting policies\" include a description of the esti - mates, assumptions and judgments applied in the prepa - ration of the consolidated financial statements of the Group. Given the uncertainties inherent in our business activ - ities, we must make certain estimates and assumptions that require difficult, subjective and complex judgments. Because of uncertainties inherent in such judgments, actual outcomes and results may differ from our assump - tions and estimates, which could materially affect the Group's consolidated financial statements. Application of the following accounting policies requires certain assumptions and estimates that have the potential for the most significant impact on our consolidated financial statements. Management believes that the estimation uncertain - ties described below did not have or are not reasonably likely to have a material impact on the Group's financial condition but could be material to the results of opera - tions or cash flows in a given period.Deductions from revenues As is typical in the pharmaceutical industry, our gross sales are subject to various deductions, which are pri - marily composed of rebates and discounts to retail cus - tomers, government agencies, wholesalers, health insur - ance companies and managed healthcare organizations. These deductions represent estimates of the related obligations, requiring the use of judgment when estimat - ing the effect of these sales deductions on gross sales for a reporting period. These adjustments are deducted from gross sales to arrive at net sales. The following summarizes the nature of some of these deductions and how the deduction is estimated. After recording these, net sales represent our best esti - mate of the cash that we expect to ultimately collect. The US market has the most complex arrangements related to revenue deductions. United States-specific healthcare plans and program rebates The United States Medicaid Drug Rebate Program is administered by state governments, using state and fed - eral funds to provide assistance to certain vulnerable and needy individuals and families. Calculating the rebates to be paid related to this program involves inter - preting relevant regulations, which are subject to chal - lenge or change in interpretative guidance by govern - ment authorities. Provisions for estimating Medicaid rebates are calculated using a combination of historical experience, product and population growth, product Item 5. Operating and Financial Review and Prospects 86pricing, and the mix of contracts and specific terms in the individual state agreements. The United States Federal Medicare Program, which funds healthcare benefits to individuals aged 65 and older, and to people with certain disabilities, provides prescription drug benefits under the Part D section of the program. This benefit is provided and administered through private prescription drug plans. Provisions for estimating Medicare Part D rebates are calculated based on the terms of individual plan agreements, product sales and population growth, product pricing, and the mix of contracts. We offer rebates to key managed healthcare and pri - vate plans in an effort to ensure patient access to our products and to sustain and increase the market share of our products. These programs provide a rebate after the plans have demonstrated they have met all terms and conditions set forth in their contract with us. These rebates are estimated based on the terms of individual agreements, historical experience, product pricing and projected product growth rates, and are recorded as a deduction from revenue at the time the related revenues are recorded. These provisions are adjusted based on established processes and experiences from filing data with individ - ual states and plans. There is often a time lag of several months between recording of the revenue deductions and the final accounting for them. Non-United States-specific healthcare plans and program rebates In certain countries other than the US, we provide rebates to governments and other entities. These rebates are often mandated by laws or government regulations. These rebates are estimated based on government reg - ulations, laws and terms of individual rebate arrange - ments, historical experience and other relevant factors, and are recorded as a deduction from revenue at the time the related revenue is recorded. These estimates are adjusted periodically to reflect actual experience. There is often a time lag of several months between the recording of revenue deductions and the final account - ing for them. Innovative pay-for-performance arrangements We enter into innovative pay-for-performance arrange - ments (i.e. outcome based arrangements) with certain healthcare providers and governments. Under these agreements, we may be required to make refunds, defer a portion of the sales price until anticipated treatment outcomes meet predefined targets, or to provide addi - tional medicines free of charge if anticipated treatment outcomes do not meet predefined targets. The impact of potential refunds, deferral of a portion of the sales price, or the delivery of additional medicines at no cost is estimated and recorded as a deduction from revenue at the time the related revenues are recorded. Estimates are based on historical experience and clini - cal data. In cases where historical experience and clini - cal data are not sufficient for a reliable estimation of the outcome, revenue recognition is deferred until such his - tory is available. These provisions for revenue deductions are adjusted periodically based on established processes and actual experience, including the products actual outcomes achieved compared to the anticipated predefined tar - gets. There is often a time lag of several months between recording of the revenue deductions and the final accounting for them. Non-healthcare plans and program rebates, returns and other deductions We offer rebates to purchasing organizations and other direct and indirect customers to sustain and increase market share and to ensure patient access to our prod - ucts. Since rebates are contractually agreed upon, the related provisions are estimated based on the terms of the individual agreements, historical experience and pro - jected product sales growth rates. Chargebacks occur where our subsidiaries have arrangements with indirect customers to sell products at prices that are lower than the price charged to whole - salers. A chargeback represents the difference between the invoice price to the wholesaler and the indirect cus - tomer's contract price. We account for chargebacks by reducing revenue by the estimate of chargebacks attrib - utable to a sales transaction. Provisions for estimated chargebacks are calculated using a combination of fac - tors, such as historical experience, product growth rates, product pricing, level of inventory in the distribution chan - nel, and the terms of individual agreements. When we sell a product providing a customer the right to return it, we record a provision for estimated sales returns based on our sales return policy and historical return rates. Other factors considered include actual product recalls, expected marketplace changes, the remaining shelf life of the product, and the expected entry of generic products. In 2021, sales returns amounted to approximately 1% of gross product sales. If sufficient experience is not available, sales are only recorded based on evidence of product consumption or when the right of return has expired. We enter into distribution service agreements with major wholesalers, which provide a financial disincentive for the wholesalers to purchase product quantities in excess of current customer demand. Where possible, we adjust shipping patterns for our products to maintain wholesalers' inventory levels consistent with underlying patient demand. We offer cash discounts to customers to encourage prompt payment. Cash discounts are estimated and accrued at the time of invoicing and are deducted from revenue. Following a decrease in the price of a product, we generally grant customers a \"shelf stock adjustment\" for their existing inventory for the relevant product. Provi - sions for shelf stock adjustments, which are primarily relevant within the Sandoz Division, are determined at the time of the price decline or at the point of sale, if the impact of a price decline on the products sold can be reasonably estimated based on the customer's inventory levels of the relevant product. Other sales discounts, such as consumer coupons and copay discount cards, are offered in some markets. The estimated amounts of these discounts are recorded at the time of sale or when the coupons are issued, and are estimated utilizing historical experience and the spe -Item 5. Operating and Financial Review and Prospects 87cific terms for each program. If a discount for a proba - ble future transaction is offered as part of a sales trans - action, then an appropriate portion of revenue is deferred to cover this estimated obligation. In addition, we offer global patient assistance pro - grams. We adjust provisions for revenue deductions period - ically to reflect actual experience. To evaluate the ade - quacy of provision balances, we use internal and exter - nal estimates of the inventory in transit, the level of inventory in the distribution and retail channels, actual claims data received, and the time lag for processing rebate claims. External data sources include reports from wholesalers and third-party market data purchased by Novartis. For the table showing the worldwide extent of our reve - nue deductions provisions and related payment experi - ences for the Group see \"Item 18. Financial Statements\u2014 Note 22. Provisions and other current liabilities.\" Gross-to-net sales reconciliation The table below shows the gross-to-net sales reconciliation for our Innovative Medicines Division: In % of In % of gross sales gross sales to third to third (USD millions) 2021 parties 2020 parties Innovative Medicines gross sales subject to deductions 60336 100.0 56067 100.0 US-specific healthcare plans and program rebates - 5125 - 8.5 - 5412 - 9.7 Non-US-specific healthcare plans and program rebates - 4399 - 7.3 - 3746 - 6.7 Non-healthcare plans and program-related rebates, returns and other deductions - 8817 - 14.6 - 7896 - 14.0 Total Innovative Medicines gross-to-net sales adjustments 1 - 18341 - 30.4 - 17054 - 30.4 Innovative Medicines net sales 41995 69.6 39013 69.6 1 The gross-to-net sales adjustments are charged through revenue deduction provisions or charged directly to the income statement without being recorded in revenue deduction provisions. Impairment of goodwill, intangible assets and property, plant and equipment We review long-lived intangible assets, plant and equip - ment for impairment whenever events or changes in cir - cumstance indicate that the asset's balance sheet car - rying amount may not be recoverable. Goodwill and other currently not amortized intangible assets are reviewed for impairment at least annually. An asset is considered impaired when its balance sheet carrying amount exceeds its estimated recover - able amount, which is defined as the higher of its fair value less costs of disposal and its value in use. Usually, Novartis applies the fair value less costs of disposal method for its impairment assessment. In most cases, no directly observable market inputs are available to measure the fair value less costs of disposal. Therefore, an estimate is derived indirectly and is based on net present value techniques utilizing post-tax cash flows and discount rates. In the limited cases where the value in use method would be applied, net present value techniques would be applied using pre-tax cash flows and discount rates. Fair value less costs of disposal reflects estimates of assumptions that market participants would be expected to use when pricing the asset or cash generating units (CGUs), and for this purpose, management considers the range of economic conditions that are expected to exist over the remaining useful life of the asset. The estimates used in calculating the net present val - ues are highly sensitive and depend on assumptions spe -cific to the nature of the Group's activities as indicated in \"Item 18. Financial Statements\u2014Note 1. Significant accounting policies.\" Due to these factors, actual cash flows and values could vary significantly from forecasted future cash flows and related values derived using dis - counting techniques. The recoverable amount of the grouping of cash-gen - erating units to which goodwill is allocated is based on fair value less costs of disposal. The valuations are derived from applying discounted future cash flows based on key assumptions, including the terminal growth rate and discount rate. For additional information on impairment charges recognized and reversed by divi - sions, see \"Item 18. Financial Statements\u2014Note 1. Sig - nificant accounting policies\u2014Impairment of goodwill and intangible assets\" and \"Item 18. Financial Statements\u2014Note 11. Goodwill and intangible assets.\" Goodwill and other intangible assets represent a sig - nificant part of our consolidated balance sheet, primar - ily due to acquisitions. Although no significant additional impairments are currently anticipated based on our impairment assessment and review of reasonable pos - sible changes in key assumptions to the respective impairment assessment, future impairment evaluation could lead to material impairment charges in the future. For more information, see \"Item 18. Financial State - ments\u2014Note 11. Goodwill and intangible assets.\" For net impairment charges for property, plant and equipment from continuing operations see \"Item 18. Finan - cial Statements\u2014Note 9. Property, plant and equipment.\"Item 5. Operating and Financial Review and Prospects 88 Contingent consideration In an acquisition or divestment of a business, it is neces - sary to recognize contingent future amounts due to pre - vious owners representing contractually defined potential amounts as a liability or asset. Usually for Novartis, these are linked to milestone or royalty payments related to cer - tain assets and are recognized as a financial liability or financial asset at their fair value, which is then remeasured at each subsequent reporting date. These estimations typically depend on factors such as technical milestones or market performance, and are adjusted for the proba - bility of their likelihood of payment and, if material, are appropriately discounted to reflect the impact of time. For additional information, see \"Item 18. Financial Statements\u2014Note 29. Financial instruments - additional disclosures.\" Retirement and other post- employment benefit plans We sponsor pension and other post-employment bene - fit plans in various forms that cover a significant portion of our current and former employees. For post-employ- ment plans with defined benefit obligations, we are required to make significant assumptions and estimates about future events in calculating the expense and the present value of the liability related to these plans. These include assumptions about the interest rates we apply to estimate future defined benefit obligations and net periodic pension expense, as well as rates of future pen - sion increases. In addition, our actuarial consultants pro - vide our management with historical statistical informa - tion, such as withdrawal and mortality rates in connection with these estimates. Assumptions and estimates used by the Group may differ materially from the actual results we experience due to changing market and economic conditions, higher or lower withdrawal rates, and longer or shorter life spans of participants, among other factors. Depending on events, such differences could have a material effect on our total equity. For more information on obligations under retirement and other post-employment benefit plans and underly-ing actuarial assumptions, see \"Item 18. Financial State - ments\u2014Note 25. Post-employment benefits for employ-ees.\" Income taxes We prepare and file our tax returns based on an inter - pretation of tax laws and regulations, and we record esti -mates based on these judgments and interpretations. Our tax returns are subject to examination by the com - petent taxing authorities, which may result in an assess - ment being made, requiring payments of additional tax, interest or penalties. Since Novartis uses its intellectual property globally to deliver goods and services, the transfer prices within the Group as well as arrangements between subsidiaries to finance research and develop - ment and other activities may be challenged by the national tax authorities in any of the jurisdictions in which Novartis operates. Therefore, inherent uncertainties exist in our estimates of our tax positions, but we believe that our estimated amounts for current and deferred tax assets or liabilities, including any amounts related to any uncertain tax positions, are appropriate based on cur - rently known facts and circumstances. For more information, see \"Item 18. Financial State - ments\u2014Note 6. Income taxes\" and \"Item 18. Financial Statements\u2014Note 12. Deferred tax assets and liabilities.\" Provisions and contingencies A number of Group companies are involved in various government investigations and legal proceedings (intel - lectual property, sales and marketing practices, product liability, commercial, employment and wrongful dis - charge, environmental claims, etc.) arising out of the nor - mal conduct of their businesses. We record provisions for legal proceedings when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reliably estimated. These provisions are adjusted periodically as assessments change or addi - tional information becomes available. For signi ficant product liability cases, the provision is actuarially deter - mined based on factors such as past experience, amount and number of claims reported, and estimates of claims incurred but not yet reported. Provisions are recorded for environmental remedia - tion costs when expenditure on remedial work is proba - ble and the cost can be reliably estimated. Novartis believes that its total provisions are ade - quate based upon currently available information. How - ever, given the inherent difficulties in estimating liabilities in this area, Novartis may incur additional costs beyond the amounts provided. Management believes that such additional amounts, if any, would not be material to the Group's financial condition but could be material to the results of operations or cash flows in a given period. For more information, see \"Item 18. Financial State - ments\u2014Note 20. Provisions and other non-current liabil - ities\" and \"Item 18. Financial Statements\u2014Note 28.

Item 6. Directors, Senior Management and Employees 906.B Compensation Dear shareholder, I am pleased to share with you the 2021 Compensation Report of Novartis AG. I would like to start by thanking Enrico Vanni for his valuable contribution during his tenure as Chair of the Compensation Committee and express my sincerest grat - itude for his support and advice since I took over the role. At Novartis, our compensation system seeks to reward our executives for delivering sustainable growth, successful outcomes on our financial and strategic tar - gets and value creation for our shareholders. We aim to be transparent in how we link executive compensation to performance and have continued to engage with shareholders and proxy advisors in this effort. 2021 changes to Executive Committee compensation system and disclosures The year completes the first three-year performance cycle of the new Long-Term Performance Plan (LTPP), following the combination of the previous LTPP and the Long-Term Relative Performance Plan (LTRPP), as com - municated in our 2018 Compensation Report. The com - bined plan focuses on four equally weighted perfor - mance metrics: net sales compound annual growth rate (CAGR), core operating income CAGR, innovation, and relative total shareholder return (TSR). In 2021, we reviewed our Compensation Report for - mat with a view to increase its accessibility while main - taining its depth of disclosure. We chose to develop our \"\u2014Compensation at a glance\" section to incorporate a more graphical illustration of the 2021 CEO pay out - comes and provide a summary of our executive compen - sation framework for the year ahead. In addition, we offer further visibility into the 2019-2021 LTPP targets, show - ing the threshold, target and maximum opportunity for each performance metric. 2021 performance highlights 2021 was a year of solid performance, with growth across sales, profits, margins and cash flow. Sales growth driv - ers were Entresto (USD 3.5 billion), Cosentyx (USD 4.7 billion), and Zolgensma (USD 1.4 billion), along ther . growth brands, along with other launch products, represent 52% of Innovative Medicines sales, up from 44% in 2020. While overall sales performance was on target, COVID-19 continued to have an impact on parts of our business, specifically Oncology and Sandoz. We continued to deliver innovation to patients in 2021 with 21 approvals, including Leqvio (US, EU) and Scem - blix (US), and 34 submissions made across our top four markets. However, the year was not without setbacks, as some clinical trials of experimental compounds - including Kymriah for blood cancer, ACZ885 (canaki - numab) for lung cancer, and CFZ533 (iscalimab) in kid - ney transplant patients - did not meet their primary goals. We progressed our efforts to deliver next-generation medicines while driving our environmental, social and gov - ernance (ESG) agenda. Pursuing new health equity initia - tives in clinical trial diversity, advancing access to medicines, and using data and digital technologies in underserved regions in Africa, South America and Asia are some exam - ples of our long-term commitment to transforming global health. More details on our ESG efforts can be found in the Novartis in Society Integrated Report 2021. Performance against the incentive targets, combined with base salary and other benefits, pension, Alcon Keep Whole awards and dividend equivalents, resulted in 2021 total realized compensation for the CEO of CHF 11 224 727. This is a reduction of 11.8% compared to 2020. Overall, while the financial and operational tar - gets were met or surpassed, some of the innovation tar - gets were missed, which led to a reduction in long-term growth potential. This is reflected in a TSR performance below the peer group median. The reduced contribution of innovation and relative TSR to the 2019-2021 LTPP cycle were the main drivers of the lower total realized compensation in 2021 versus 2020. (For more informa - tion, please see \"\u2014LTPP performance outcomes\") 2022 Board compensation and Annual General Meeting (AGM) The Board is planning to split the Vice Chairman and Lead Independent Director (LID) roles, and to appoint separate board members to these roles as from the 2022 AGM. The Board has approved the introduction of an LID fee. More information can be found in \"\u20142022 Board compensation\" and \"\u2014Vice Chairman and Lead Indepen - dent Director\" in Item 6.C of this Annual Report. In line with our Articles of Incorporation, we put to a vote the maximum aggregate amount of compensation for the Board of Directors from the 2022 AGM to the 2023 AGM, and the maximum aggregate amount of com - pensation for the Executive Committee for the financial year 2023. We also request your advisory vote on this Compensation Report. We deeply value our ongoing dialogue with you and other stakeholders. As always, we welcome your feed - back, which is extremely valuable in driving improve - ments in our compensation system and practices. Finally, I would like to acknowledge and thank my fel - low committee members for their diligence and service during the year. Simon Moroney, D.Phil. Chair of the Compensation CommitteeItem 6.

SanofiAstraZeneca Eli Lilly & Co. Johnson & Johnson Pfizer Item 6. Directors, Senior Management and Employees 93Executive Committee compensation philosophy and principles Novartis compensation philosophy Our compensation philosophy aims to ensure that we attract and retain outstanding Executive Committee members and reward them according to their success in implementing the Company strategy, and their contri - bution to Company performance and long-term value creation. The main elements of our compensation phi - losophy are set out in the table below. Alignment with Company strategy Our strategy is to build a focused medicines company powered by technology leadership in research and development, world-class commercialization, global access and data science. We foster a company culture that is inspired, curious and unbossed. We believe these elements drive continued innovation and will support the creation of value over the long term for our Company, employees, society and shareholders. To continue to align the compensation system with this strategy and to ensure that Novartis is a high- performing organization, the Company operates both a short-term Annual Incentive plan and a Long-Term Incen - tive (LTI) plan with a balanced set of measures and tar - gets. The Board of Directors determines specific, mea - surable and time-bound performance measures for the Annual Incentive and LTI plans. The Compensation Com - mittee reviewed the existing compensation system and determined that it continues to support our strategy.Approach to market benchmarking There remains significant competition for top executive talent with deep expertise, competencies and proven per - formance within the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries. As such, external peer compensation data is one of a number of key reference points considered by the Board of Directors and the Compensation Committee when making decisions on executive pay, helping to ensure that the compensation system and compensation levels at Novartis remain competitive. Novartis makes the commitment to shareholders to confirm benchmarking practices, including the peer group, each year. The Compensation Committee believes in a rigorous approach to peer group construction and maintenance. The Compensation Committee also believes that using a consistent set of peers that is similar in size and scope enables shareholders to evaluate the compensation year on year and make pay-for-performance comparisons. In 2021, the Compensation Committee decided to maintain the same primary peer group of 14 global healthcare companies , as presented in the table below. The companies in this peer group reflect our industry and are similar to Novartis in terms of both size and scope of operations. Although Novartis is headquartered in Switzerland, more than a third of its sales come from the US market, and the US remains a significant talent pool for the recruitment of executives by the Company. It is therefore critical that Novartis is able to attract and retain key talent globally, especially from the US. For consideration of European and local practices, the Compensation Committee also reviewed in 2021 a cross-industry peer group of Europe-headquartered multinational companies, selected based on compara - bility to Novartis in terms of industry, size, global scope of operations, and economic influence. Based on this review, the selected European peers were Anheus - er-Busch InBev, AstraZeneca, Bayer, BMW, GlaxoSmith KgaA, Nestl\u00e9, Novo Nordisk, Reck - itt Benckiser (new), Roche, Siemens (new), Sanofi and Unilever.ELEMENT OF COMPENSATION POLICY Level The overall package should be market-competitive to enable the recruitment of global executive talent with deep expertise and competencies. Annual base salary The Compensation Committee may appoint individuals who are new to a role on an annual base salary that is below the market level, with a view to increase this toward market level over a period of three to four years as an individual develops in the role. This prudent approach ensures pay levels are merit-based, with increases dependent on strong performance and proven ability in the role over a sustained period. Incentives The compensation package will normally include the key compensation elements and incentive opportunities in line with those offered to current Executive Committee members. In exceptional circumstances, higher Long-Term Incentive opportunities than those offered to current Executive Committee members may be provided at the Compensation Committee's discretion. Performance measures may include business-specific measures tailored to the specific role. Pension and other benefits Newly appointed Executive Committee members are eligible for the local country pension plan and other benefits in line with the wider employee group. Buyouts The Compensation Committee seeks to balance the need to offer competitive compensation opportunities to acquire the talent required by the business with the principle of maintaining a strong focus on pay for performance. As such, when an individual forfeits variable compensation as a result of an appointment at Novartis, the Compensation Committee may offer replacement awards in such form as the Compensation Committee considers appropriate, taking into account relevant factors. Relevant factors include the replacement vehicle (i.e., cash, restricted share units, restricted shares or performance share units), whether the award is contingent on meeting performance conditions or not, the expected value of the forfeited award, the timing of forfeiture (i.e., Novartis mirrors the blocking or vesting period of the forfeited award) and the leaver conditions, in case the recruited individual leaves Novartis prior to the end of the blocking or vesting period. The Compensation Committee will seek to pay no more than is required to match the commercial value or fair value of payments and awards forfeited by the individual. International mobility If individuals are required to relocate or be assigned away from their home location to take up their position, relocation support may be provided in line with our global mobility policies (i.e., relocation support, tax equalization). This includes ongoing US state income tax liabilities on behalf of US citizens locally employed outside the US who have US workdays and therefore, US state taxable compensation which generates a US state tax liability.

Death or long-term disability Accelerated vesting at target is applied. Voluntary resignation or termination by the Company for misconduct or poor performance All of the award is forfeited. Item 6. Directors, Senior Management and Employees 95T reatment of variable compensation for Executive Committee leavers Malus and clawback Any incentive compensation paid to Executive Commit - tee members is subject to malus and clawback rules. This means that the Board of Directors for the CEO, and the Compensation Committee for the other Executive Committee members, may decide - subject to applica - ble law - to retain any unpaid or unvested incentive com - pensation (malus), or to recover incentive compensation that has been paid or has vested in the past (clawback). This applies in cases where the payout has resulted from a violation of laws or conflicts with internal management standards, including Company and accounting policies. This principle applies to both the short-term Annual Incentive and LTI plans.Objective setting The CEO proposes his targets to the Chairman of the Board; they are then reviewed and approved by the Board of Directors, based on input from the Compensation Committee. For other Executive Committee members, targets for their division or unit are initially discussed with the CEO and subsequently approved by the Board of Directors and Compensation Committee.Performance evaluation The CEO's performance against the individual balanced scorecard is assessed by the Board of Directors. For Executive Committee members, the CEO discusses with the Chairman each member's performance (assessed against his or her individual balanced scorecard) before making recommendations to the Board of Directors. Periodic assessments, including at the mid-year stage, ensure progress is suitably tracked.Compensation determination A recommendation for the CEO's variable pay is made by the Compensation Committee to the Board of Directors for final determination. For the Long-Term Incentive financial measures payout schedules, a formulaic approach applies and the Compensation Committee can also exercise judgment to ensure there is appropriate alignment between payout levels and overall performance achieved. The same principle of discretion applies to the relative TSR and innovation performance measures. The CEO's recommendations for other Executive Committee members are considered and approved by the Compensation Committee, after which the Board of Directors is notified of the outcomes.Item 6. Directors, Senior Management and Employees 96Executive Committee performance management process To foster a high-performance culture, the Company applies a performance management process based on quantitative and qualitative criteria. The CEO and the other Executive Committee members are subject to a formal three-step process: objective setting, perfor - mance evaluation and compensation determination. This process is explained in the chart below. Performance targets are generally set before the start of the relevant performance cycle. There is a rigor - ous framework in place for establishing targets to ensure they are suitably robust and challenging, and align with the strategic priorities of the Group. The key factors taken into account when setting tar - gets include: Internal and external market expectations Novartis strategic priorities Regulatory factors (e.g., new launches, patent expiries) Investment in capital expenditure Values and BehaviorsThe targets are challenged at multiple stages before they are ultimately approved by the Board of Directors. In line with good governance practices, the Compensation Committee works to set targets that are ambitious and challenging but do not encourage undue risk-taking. Following the end of the performance cycle, the Board of Directors and the Compensation Committee consider performance against the targets originally set. The CEO and Executive Committee members are not present while the Board of Directors and the Compensation Commit - tee discuss their individual performance evaluations. Prior to determining the final outcome, related factors such as performance relative to peers, wider market con - ditions, general industry trends and good practice are used to inform the overall performance assessment. Annual base salary Overview The annual base salary is reviewed each year, taking into account the individual's role, performance and experience; business performance and the external environment; increases across the Group; and market movements. 2021 annual base salaries The 2021 annual base salaries were as follows: CEO (effective March 1, 2021): CHF 1 771 500. OTHER EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE MEMBERS (effective March 1, 2021): All other members of the Executive Committee were awarded increases in line with the average of all Novartis employees, with the exception of five individuals as disclosed in Item 6.B of the 2020 Annual Report. Pension and other benefits Overview Pension and other benefits do not constitute a significant proportion of total compensation and are provided to the Executive Committee on the same terms as all other employees based on local country practices and regulations. The CEO and all other Swiss-based members of the Executive Committee are members of the Novartis Swiss pension funds, which provide Company contributions on the base salary and Annual Incentive up to the legal cap on the insured salary of CHF 860 400. No supplementary pension plans or savings plans are provided. The CEO's employer pension contributions represent 9.99% of his base salary. Globally the Company operates both defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans (see also Note 25 to the Group's consolidated financial statements). Novartis may provide other benefits according to local market practice. These include Company car provision, tax and financial planning, and insurance benefits. Executive Committee members who are required to relocate internationally may also receive additional benefits (including tax equalization), in line with the Company's global mobility policies. Item 6. Directors, Senior Management and Employees 972021 Executive Committee compensation PLAN OVERVIEW Target Annual Incentive On-target opportunities CEO: 150% of annual base salary Other Executive Committee members: 80% to 120% of annual base salary Performance measures An Annual Incentive balanced scorecard containing: Financial performance measures related to Group, division or business unit, where relevant (60% weighting) Five key strategic objectives in the areas of innovation, operational excellence, data and digital, people and culture, and building trust with society (40% weighting) The 2021 balanced scorecard targets and achievements of the CEO are detailed on the next page. The 2021 balanced scorecards for other Executive Committee members include Group financial targets as well as financial or other quantitative targets that relate to their division or business unit, if applicable. Values and Behaviors are a key component of the Annual Incentive and are embedded in our culture. As such, members of the Executive Committee are expected to demonstrate these to the highest standards. Target setting Financial targets are set at the beginning of each financial year and align with the strategic plan proposed by management to the Board of Directors for approval. The strategic objectives are aligned with the most important priorities in any performance year. Payout ranges The payout schedule for the Annual Incentive incorporates performance against financial and strategic objectives. The payout range is 0% to 200% of on-target opportunity based on performance, as shown below: PERFORMANCE PAYOUT (% of on-target) Outstanding 170% - 200% Exceeds expectations 130% - 160% Meets expectations 80% - 120% Partially meets expectations 40% - 70% Below expectations 0% Payout formula Payout vehicle At the end of the performance period, 50% is paid in cash, and the remaining 50% is delivered in Novartis restricted shares or RSUs, deferred for three years (see \"\u2014Executive Committee compensation system\"). Executives may choose to receive all or part of the cash portion of their Annual Incentive in Novartis shares or American Depositary Receipts (ADRs; US only) that will not be subject to forfeiture conditions. In the US, awards may also be delivered in cash under the US-deferred compensation plan. Dividend rights, voting rights and settlement Novartis restricted shares carry voting rights and dividends during the vesting period. RSUs are of equivalent value but do not carry voting rights and dividends during the vesting period. Following the vesting period, settlement of RSUs is made in unrestricted Novartis shares or ADRs.

Directors, Senior Management and Employees 982021 Annual Incentive2021 CEO BALANCED SCORECARD This section presents the balanced scorecard for the CEO. Balanced scorecard performance is measured in constant cur - rencies (cc) to reflect operational performance that can be influenced. The Board of Directors uses a stringent process to set ambitious financial targets to incentivize superior performance. In addition to the financial targets, the CEO also has ambitious strategic objectives across five key pillars, two of which are related to ESG matters. Achievement versus CEO achievements - 2021 Target target Financial measures - 60% of total Annual Incentive, comprising: Group net sales (cc) (30%) 50 010 million Met Group operating income (cc) (30%) | 10 805 million | Above Group free cash flow as a % of sales (cc) (20%) | 24.9% | Above Share of peers for Novartis Group (USD) (20%) 8.1% Below Overall assessment of Group financial targets in constant currencies Met Strategic objectives - 40% of total Annual Incentive, comprising: Innovation (20%) | Below Novartis continued to deliver a range of innovations to patients in 2021. Major approvals included Leqvio (US, EU), Scemblix (US), and Kesimpta (EU). Amongst our critical clinical trials, Cosentyx met primary efficacy endpoint in two hidradenitis suppurativa Phase III studies, and the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted Breakth - rough Therapy designation to LU-PSMA based on Phase III studies that demonstrated significant positive results in the treatment of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. Thirty-four submissions were made across our top four markets: the US, the EU, China and Japan. We advanced our diverse pipeline of investigational therapies, with 20 clinical data readouts and seven transitions into our Global Drug Development (GDD) organization. In our early-stage development activities, we secured 12 proofs of concept (POCs)/ proofs of mechanism (POMs). We continued to invest in technology platforms with the initiation of Phase III trials for Zolgensma for older children and advancing two rapid CAR-Ts into pivotal trials following positive POC results. We also continued to expand our portfolio of radio-ligand therapies and siRNA therapeutics. The year was however not without setbacks, as several clinical trials of experimental compounds did not meet their primary goals, including Kymriah for second line diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), canakinumab for lung cancer, iscalimab in kidney transplant patients, and the program on ECF843 for treatment of dry eye. The biosimilars pipeline was expanded with one late-stage alliance program and early-stage internal programs, strengthening our 15-plus molecule pipeline. The pipeline was further advanced through partnerships with BeiGene, Alnylam, Molecular Partners and UCB; bolt-on acquisitions Therapeutics and Arctos Medical; and the out-licensing of products out - side of our core areas. Operational excellence (20%) | Above Financial performance in 2021 improved from last year on core operating income and core margin, to USD 16.0 billion and 32.0% in constant currencies respectively. Net income exceeded target. The gain from the divestment of the investment in Roche Holding AG was not considered in any of the performance assessments. The financial performance was largely driven by growth brands Cosentyx and Entresto , which together generated USD 8.3 billion in sales as well as other growth drivers like Zolgensma , Promacta/Revolade , Kisqali , and Kesimpta . However, effects of the pandemic were still apparent in Oncology and Sandoz as we continued to see delays in cancer care and a weak flu season dampened generics sales. Key launches were successfully executed in 2021 with Entresto (US; to treat heart failure with preserved ejection fraction) and Kesimpta (EU, Japan) achieving their sales goals. We continue to optimize our network of manufacturing sites and testing labs worldwide, adjusting our production capacity to match our changing product mix. Overall, our year-end footprint was consolidated to 53 sites, with a number of other site exits planned. Data and digital (20%) | Met Using data science and digital technology, we opened new paths to treat disease, engage with customers, support patients and streamline our operations. Our industry-leading data42 platform continued to expand, integrating additional external data sets and making data from more than 2 700 clinical trials, as well as data from real-world settings, available to data scientists and researchers across Novartis. In partnership with Microsoft, we rolled out a new artificial intelligence platform that connects data sets and levera - ges information from past formulations which was used by our development team for formulation development and early manufacturing of investigational medicines. Usage of AI Nurse, our cardiovascular disease app developed in collaboration with Tencent, grew to more than 300 000 patients and more than 5 000 healthcare professionals across 1 000 hospitals in China using it. SpotOn, a platform in our manufacturing operations, was expanded to five sites providing multiple digital solutions to help maximize economy of scale, reduce throughput times, and optimize inventories. Item 6. Directors, Senior Management and Employees 992021 CEO BALANCED SCORECARD CONTINUED People and culture (20%) | Met We made progress on our Equal Pay International Coalition (EPIC) pledge to achieve gender balance in manage - ment by 2023 and ensure pay equity and transparency for all our employees globally. The percentage of women in management increased to 46% in 2021 (from 45% in 2020). In addition to our prior year progress, we achieved pay transparency in a further 10 countries in 2021, including Switzerland and the US bringing the total to 16 countries where employees can compare their pay to external benchmarks. Additionally, we eliminated historical salary data from 80% of global hiring to reduce the risk of bias when making job offers. Based on the data available at the time of disclosure, Novartis has a global mean pay gap of +3.3%, compared with 3.6% in the prior year. While we acknowledge this percentage is influenced by worldwide workforce demographics, this is significantly ahead of the Bloomberg benchmarks of +21% mean for the same period. We continued our progress on building a curious and learning culture, and achieved an employee engagement score of 78, which is five points higher than the industry benchmark. In 2021 we had an additional 5 000 managers taking part in the 'Unbossed Leadership Experience', a development program for leaders. Building trust with society (including access to healthcare, reputation and other ESG topics) (20%) | Met ETHICAL STANDARDS In 2021, we completed the integration of human rights into the risk areas (labor rights, health and safety, data pri - vacy, and anti-bribery and corruption) of our Third-Party Risk Management (TPRM) process. All our new suppliers have been assessed against all of these TPRM risks. Novartis participated in a collective action initiated by Norges Bank Investment Management (NBIM) to jointly develop a reporting standard on anti-corruption. We published our first anti-bribery report for 2021 based on the guidance issued by NBIM and aligned with principles such as the United Nations (UN) Global Compact and the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises. PRICING AND ACCESS We made progress on health equity with 100% of US Phase III studies evaluating diversity and inclusion principles in feasibility planning since mid-2021. A global access strategy is defined for 100% of our new Innovative Medicines launches. In 2021, we launched a total of 31 new emerging market brands (EMBs) across this portfolio and reduced the time lag between launches in Europe and low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). For example, Kesimpta was launched in Brazil within 4 months of first launch in Europe; Tabrecta EMB was launched in India 6 months ahead of planned first launch in Europe, and Adakveo EMB was launched simultaneously in India and Germany. In 2021 we reached more than 56 million patients through our access approaches including flagship programs, emerging market brands, support programs and donations. The Access to Medicine Foundation recognized our efforts in this area, ranking us second in the 2021 Access to Medicine Index. GLOBAL HEALTH Our flagship programs reached more than 32 million patients in LMICs. We continued to make important contri - butions to improving global health by focusing on the control or elimination of four priority diseases (sickle cell disease, Chagas disease, malaria, and leprosy). We achieved several of our Global Health pipeline milestones in 2021; for example, positive results were reported for the Phase IIb study of KAF156, a Novartis compound for malaria, and its partner medicine, lumefantrine, in adults and children with malaria. We also expanded our sickle cell disease (SCD) program rollout in India, which has the world's highest burden of SCD outside of Africa, and in Ghana and Uganda. RESPONSIBLE CITIZENSHIP In 2021, we committed to a 2040 goal to become net zero across our value chain, leveraging our efforts to be carbon neutral across our value chain by 2030. In this pursuit, we exceeded our targets with a 34% reduction in Scope 1 and 2 emissions, and 40% and 56% reduction in our water consumption and waste respectively, versus the 2016 baseline. Overall assessment of strategic objectives Met Overall assessment of CEO balanced scorecard Met ANNUAL INCENTIVE PAYOUT Payout The 2021 CEO performance showed solid financial results, including sales and profit growth at or above target and most strategic objectives were achieved or exceeded. Productivity improvements in Technical Operations were a particular highlight. However, several clinical trial failures resulted in a disappointing share price development. On balance, based on the overall assessment, the Board of Directors decided on an Annual Incentive payout for the CEO amounting to CHF 2 657 267 , which is 100% of target, within the range of 0-200%. Item 6. Directors, Senior Management and Employees 100OVERVIEW OF LONG-TERM PERFORMANCE PLAN Award vehicle Performance share units (PSUs) are granted at the beginning of the three-year performance cycle and vest at the end of the cycle to the extent that performance conditions have been met. At the time of vesting, they are converted into Novartis shares. PSUs carry dividend equivalents that are paid in shares at the end of the cycle. Grant formula At the start of the performance cycle, PSUs are granted under the Long-Term Incentive plan, as follows: Target opportunity CEO: 325% of annual base salary Other Executive Committee members: between 180% and 260% of annual base salary Performance measures Net sales CAGR Core operating income CAGR Innovation metrics Relative TSR Target setting Financial targets: Targets for net sales CAGR and core operating income CAGR are set based on the strategic plan of the Company. Innovation: Global Drug Development (GDD) targets are based on targeted filings communicated at the start of each performance cycle. The Science & Technology Committee determines the most important Novartis Institutes for BioMedical Research (NIBR) milestones. Payout range Financial targets: When assessing performance, achievements for threshold, target and maximum payout are defined for each metric and a payout curve is applied to determine the corresponding payout between 0-200% against target. Innovation: At the end of the cycle, the Compensation Committee determines the payout factor in the range of 0-150% based on the performance assessment made by the Science & Technology Committee. A payout between 150-200% of target is only delivered for truly exceptional performance. Relative TSR: Performance on TSR is assessed relative to a global healthcare peer group, as outlined below. As disclosed in the 2018 Compensation Report, the share value for the 2019-2021 cycle is determined by using the one-day pricing approach for the start of the performance cycle and the three-month averaging method at the end of the cycle. (From cycles 2020-2022 onwards, a three-month averaging method will be used for both the start and the end of the cycle.) Companies are then ranked in order of highest to lowest TSR in USD. The Compensation Committee may use its discretion on each metric, including deciding on the payout within the ranges where appropriate. In doing so, it takes into consideration factors such as the underlying assumptions of the targets set at the beginning of the cycle, overall economic conditions, currency fluctuations and other unforeseeable situations.

Directors, Senior Management and Employees 101Long- T erm Performance Plan, 2019-2021 cycle As communicated in the 2018 Compensation Report, for awards granted effective 2019, the existing LTPP and LTRPP were combined into a single Long-Term Perfor - mance Plan. The aim was to introduce a simplified LTI program that compensates executives more directly on performance linked to the Group's strategic imperatives of accelerating growth and margin expansion to drive long-term value.The previous financial performance measure was replaced by net sales CAGR and core operating income CAGR in the simplified LTPP. The long-term innovation and relative TSR performance measures were retained, and an equal weighting applies to each of the aforemen - tioned measures. Each of the four measures has a max - imum payout of 200% of target.Item 6. Directors, Senior Management and Employees 102L TPP performance outcomes The charts below illustrate the performance of the 2019-2021 LTPP against target. NET SALES CAGR (25% 0-200% of target INNOVATION (25% weighting) The following developments were considered in our 2019-2021 LTPP innovation performance: US and EU approvals for Leqvio to treat hyperlipidemia US and EU approvals for Kesimpta to treat multiple sclerosis and for Adakveo to treat sickle cell disease US approval for Scemblix to treat chronic myeloid leukemia, and US and EU submission of 177Lu-PSMA-617 to treat prostate cancer The first FDA filing acceptance for VDT482 (tislelizumab), to treat esophageal cancer The Phase III BELINDA study on Kymriah and the Phase III CANOPY-2 study evaluating ACZ885 (canakinumab), which did not meet their primary endpoints and were terminated In NIBR, two novel cell therapies and two novel renal medicines were brought to clinical phase, and three transcription factor targeting projects identified as development candidates Based on input from the Science & Technology Committee, the Board of Directors approved an innovation performance factor of 109% of tar - get.RELATIVE TOTAL SHAREHOLDER RETURN (TSR) (25% weighting) Novartis position Payout range in the peer group (% of target) Position 1 - 2 Position 3 - 5 Position 6 - 8 Position 9 - 15170% - 200% 130% - 160% of targetNovartis achieved a net sales CAGR of 5.2% (in constant currencies - cc) against the 4.3% target set at the beginning of the performance cycle. The strong performance was mainly driven by Entresto, Gilenya, Cosentyx and Zolgensma , and partly offset by pricing pressures in our retail generics business. Following the application of the payout curve, the net sales CAGR (cc) achievement generates a payout factor of 119% for this part of the LTPP.Novartis achieved a COI CAGR of 13.2% (cc) against the 7.0% target set at the beginning of the performance cycle. This was mainly driven by Higher Innovative Medicines sales over the three-year cycle (pre - dominantly in 2019) Continued transformation of our manufacturing network, and pro - ductivity improvements in marketing and sales as well as research and development Following the application of the payout curve, and plan rules on limiting payout to the maximum of the range, the COI CAGR (cc) achievement generates the maximum payout factor of 200% for this part of the LTPP.Note: Actual performance was adjusted for mergers and acquisitions as well as business development and licensing projects not included in the target. TSR for the 2019-2021 cycle was 22.2%. As a result, Novartis ranked No. 12 out of 15 healthcare companies (including Novartis). Considering that the relative TSR rank is below median, there was a zero payout for this metric. 2019-2021 LTPP PAYOUT Net the Board of Directors approved a 2019-2021 LTPP payout at 107% of target, within the range of 0-200%. No adjustments, pandemic- related or otherwise, were made in the evaluation of performance. This resulted in an LTPP payout of CHF 6 356 128 for the CEO, including Alcon Keep Whole awards of CHF 612 696 and dividend equivalents of CHF 581 198.Item 6. Directors, Senior Management and Employees 103Compensation for joining and departing Executive Committee members in 2021 2021 Executive Committee member appointments In 2021, two new appointments were made to the Executive Committee. Karen L. Hale, Chief Legal Officer, was appointed a member of the Executive Committee on May 15, 2021. A buyout award in cash of CHF 111 975 was granted to replace compensation forfeited from her former employer as a result of her appointment at Novartis, in line with our policy (see \"\u2014Executive Committee appointments compen - sation policy\"). Robert Kowalski was promoted internally as Chief People & Organization (P&O) Officer on September 1, 2021. 2021 Executive Committee member departures In determining the compensation arrangements for departing Executive Committee members, the Compensation Committee ensures that contractual entitlements are respected, and all payments are in line with our plan rules and the Swiss Ordinance against Excessive Compensation in Listed Companies. All Executive Committee members have a 12-month notice period during which they are entitled to their con - tractual base salary, pension, Annual Incentive and other benefits. No new LTPP grants are made during the notice period. The plan rules require that any equity vesting will occur on the normal vesting date (i.e., there is no accelerated vesting, with the exception of termination due to death or long-term disability, and malus and clawback as well as non-compete restrictions will continue to apply). No severance or non-compete payments are made to departing Executive Committee members. Further details on the policy treatment of variable compensation for departing Executive Committee members can be found in \"\u2014Treatment of variable compensation for Executive Committee leavers.\" Former Chief Legal Officer of Novartis, Shannon Klinger, resigned from the Executive Committee as of March 15, 2021. The Board of Directors agreed to shorten her 12-month notice period and decided on a cool-off period until May 31, 2021, during which she had no access to any confidential information concerning the Company. Strictly in line with the Novartis incentive plan rules, her Annual Incentive for the 2021 performance year; unvested DSBP awarded in 2019, 2020 and 2021 were all forfeited in full. Former Chief Digital Officer of Novartis, Bertrand Bodson, left the Executive Committee on February 1, 2021, and former Chief People & Organization Officer of Novartis, Steven Baert, left the Executive Committee on June 30, 2021. Both departed under good leaver conditions. Subsequently, the Board of Directors agreed to shorten the 12-month notice period for both Mr. Bodson and Mr. Baert to allow them to take on new positions on December 1, 2021, and October 1, 2021, respectively, with com - panies that are not in the Novartis comparator peer group as defined in the applicable variable pay plan rules. Out - standing LTI grants will vest at the end of the relevant performance cycles on a pro-rata basis, per their contrac - tual agreements and in line with the said plan rules.Item 6. Directors, Senior Management and Employees 104Realized compensation To aid shareholders' understanding of the link between pay and performance, the Compensation Committee dis - closes the realized compensation for the CEO individually, and for the other members of the Executive Committee on an aggregated basis. Disclosing realized compensation means that the Annual Incentive and the LTI are dis - closed at the end of their respective performance cycles, reflecting actual payouts based on performance. The total actual payout may vary year on year depending on multiple factors, including the composition of the Executive Committee and the tenure of its members (as new members may not have a vested LTI), compensation increases, payout of variable compensation based on actual performance, share price fluctuations of the LTI, and dividend equivalents. As communicated in the previous Compensation Reports, all Novartis shareholders received a dividend in kind in Alcon shares at the spin-off date, which created immediate and significant value to shareholders. Unvested per - formance share units (PSUs), such as the LTPP, were not entitled to such dividend in kind. To ensure equal treat - ment relative to shareholders, PSU holders were instead awarded Alcon Keep Whole awards of similar value to the dividend in kind. These are only realized at the same time as the underlying PSUs and are subject to the same per - formance conditions. The vesting of these Alcon Keep Whole awards will be disclosed in the realized compensa - tion of the CEO and Executive Committee members. 2021 realized compensation for the CEO and other Executive Committee members The table below reports fixed and other compensation for the year, including the Annual Incentive for the 2021 per - formance year, the realized LTI for the 2019-2021 performance cycle, and any buyouts vesting in 2021. The portion of the Annual Incentive paid in shares for the year 2021 is disclosed using the underlying value of Novartis shares at the date of grant, while the realized values of any other equity awards (including dividend equivalents) are cal - culated using the share price on the date of vesting. To determine the appropriateness of the 2021 CEO and executive compensation payouts under the Annual Incentive and LTI plans, the Board of Directors and the Compensation Committee reviewed management's perfor - mance and contribution, taking the following into consideration: Operational and financial performance against targets Progress toward strengthening our global product portfolio Accomplishments across all strategic pillars, with careful attention to ESG targets The incentive performance outcomes, combined with base salary and other benefits, pension, Alcon Keep Whole awards and dividend equivalents, resulted in 2021 total realized compensation for the CEO of CHF 11 224 727 . 2021 realized compensation for the CEO and other Executive Committee members 2021 annual base 2021 pension 2021 Annual Incentive Long-Term Other 2021 salary benefits1 Incentives compensation LTPP 2019-2021 cycle Total realized compensation Equity (value (incl. share Currency Cash (amount) Amount Cash Equity2 at vesting date)3 Amount4,5 price movement)6 Executive Committee Narasimhan (CEO) CHF 1 769 200 176 731 1 328 625 1 328 642 6 356 128 265 401 11 224 727 Aggregate realized compensation of the other 14 Executive Committee members, including the members who stepped down during the financial year 2021 7,8 CHF 8 983 841 2 065 561 4 174 006 5 400 015 18 770 029 6 021 712 45 415 164 Total CHF 10 753 041 2 242 292 5 502 631 6 728 657 25 126 157 6 287 113 56 639 891 See 2020 realized compensation for the CEO and other Executive Committee members for 2020 comparative figures. 1 Includes mandatory employer contributions of CHF 5 498 for the CEO and CHF 53 693 for the other Executive Committee members paid by Novartis to governmental social security systems. This amount is out of total employer contributions of CHF 4 966 397 paid in 2021 for all Executive Committee members, and provides a right to the maximum future insured government pension benefit. 2 The portion of the Annual Incentive delivered in equity is rounded up to the nearest share, based on the closing share price on the grant date (January 26, 2022) of CHF 78.16 per Novartis share and USD 84.24 per ADR. 3 The amounts represent the underlying share value of the 296 741 LTPP PSUs vesting on January 22, 2022, to the CEO and other Executive Committee members for the 2019-2021 performance cycle, inclusive of earned Alcon Keep Whole awards and dividend equivalents for the three-year cycle (for details, see ''\u2014LTPP performance outcomes''). The taxable value is determined using the closing share price on the day the Novartis Board of Directors approved the final LTPP performance factor (i.e., January 26, 2022) of CHF 78.16 per Novartis share and USD 84.24 per ADR. Marie-France Tschudin and Robert Kowalski were promoted to the Executive Committee during the course of the 2019-2021 performance period, and as such, the information disclosed reflects their pro-rata LTPP 2019-2021 payout attributable to the period in which they were members of the Executive Committee. Richard Saynor and Karen Hale joined Novartis after the 2019 LTI awards were made and hence did not receive an LTPP award for the 2019-2021 performance period. 4 Includes any other perquisites, benefits in kind, and international assignment benefits as per the global mobility policy (e.g., housing, international health insurance, children's school fees, tax equalization). The 2021 tax payments were CHF 127 009 for Mr. Saynor, as well as CHF 822 808 for Susanne Schaffert, and CHF 156 788 for Vas Narasimhan. 5 Includes 6 128 vested RSUs and 3 546 PSUs (for a total value of CHF 782 649), which vested partially on March 13, 2021, and partially on July 28, 2021, to John Tsai in lieu of the LTI that he forfeited when leaving his previous employer. Also includes 2 584 vested RSUs and 2 043 vested PSUs (for a total value of CHF 379 414), which vested on February 14, 2021, to Mr. Saynor in lieu of the LTI that he forfeited when leaving his previous employer, and 4 313 vested PSUs (CHF 370 961) on January 18, 2021, to Klaus Moosmayer in lieu of the LTI he forfeited when leaving his previous employer. 6 All amounts are before deduction of the social security contribution and income tax due from the Executive Committee member. 7 Includes the first six weeks of Karen Hale's compensation, before her appointment to the Executive Committee, under other compensation. Comprises the compensation of Bertrand Bodson, former Chief Data Officer and Steven Baert, former Chief People & Organization Officer, including the vesting of their Long-Term Incentives for 2019-2021 performance cycle, as per the plan rules. The compensation and benefits elements related to the period after the step-down dates are reported under the other compensation column. Unvested shares for Shannon Klinger were forfeited upon her departure from the Company. See \"\u20142021 Executive Committee member departures\" for details. 8 Amounts for Executive Committee members paid in USD were converted at a rate of USD 1.00 = CHF 0.9139, which is the same average exchange rate used in the Group's 2021 consolidated financial statements (a similar rule applies to payments made in other currencies during the year).Item 6. Directors, Senior Management and Employees 105The table and information below provide additional details on awards granted as part of the 2019-2021 LTPP per - formance cycle, including the number of shares awarded and delivered, following the application of the payout fac - tor and the addition of dividend equivalent shares. 2019-2021 L TPP performance cycle PSUs at grant Shares delivered at vesting Dividend Total shares PSUs Performance shares Dividend equivalent shares delivered at vesting (target value Payout factor Performance shares delivered at vesting equivalent shares delivered at vesting (value at PSUs at grant date) for ECN LTPP delivered at vesting (value at vesting date) delivered at vesting (value at vesting date) vesting date) (target number) (CHF) 2 (% of target) (number) (CHF) 3 (CHF) Executive Committee Vasant Narasimhan 69 052 6 086 243 107% 73 886 5 774 930 7 436 581 198 6 356 128 Other 14 Executive Committee members, including the members who stepped down during the financial year 2021 5 202 990 17 625 412 107% 218 916 17 071 653 21 880 1 733 318 18 770 029 Total 272 042 23 711 655 292 802 22 846 583 29 316 2 314 516 25 126 157 1 Marie-France Tschudin and Robert Kowalski joined the Executive Committee during the course of the 2019-2021 performance period. As such, the information disclosed reflects their pro-rata LTPP 2019-2021 attributable to the period in which they were members of the Executive Committee. Richard Saynor and Karen Hale joined Novartis after the 2019-2021 LTPP awards were made and hence did not receive an LTPP award for this performance period. 2 The shown amounts represent the underlying share value of the target number of PSUs granted to each Executive Committee member for the 2019-2021 performance period, based on the closing share price on the grant date (January 22, 2019) of CHF 88.14 per Novartis share and USD 88.32 per ADR (pre-Alcon spin-off share price). 3 The shown amounts, inclusive of earned Alcon Keep Whole awards, represent the underlying share value of the number of PSUs vested for the 2019-2021 performance period, based on the closing share price on the day the Novartis Board of Directors approved the final LTPP performance payout factor (i.e., January 26, 2022) of CHF 78.16 per Novartis share and USD 84.24 per ADR. 4 Dividend equivalent shares are calculated on the dividend each member of the Executive Committee would have received, based on the actual number of shares delivered at the end of the 2019-2021 performance period. At vesting, the dividend equivalents are credited in shares or ADRs. 5 Includes the LTPP vesting for Bertrand Bodson, former Chief Data Officer and Steven Baert, former Chief People Officer for 2019-2021 performance cycle, as per the plan rules. The LTPP vesting for Shannon Klinger were forfeited upon her departure from the Company on May 31, 2021.Item 6. Directors, Senior Management and Employees 106The table and information below provide details on the 2020 realized compensation for the CEO and other Exec - utive Committee members, for comparative purposes. When comparing this with the 2021 realized compensation, it is important to recognize that the two LTI plans (LTPP and LTRPP) were combined into a single LTPP from the 2019-2021 cycle. 2020 realized compensation for the CEO and other Executive Committee members 2020 annual base 2020 pension 2020 Annual Incentive Long-Term Incentives Other 2020 salary benefits1 compensation LTPP 2018-2020 LTRPP 2018-2020 cycle cycle Total realized compensation Equity (value Equity (value (incl. share Currency Cash (amount) Amount Cash Equity2 at vesting date)3 at vesting date)3 Amount2,4,5 price movement)6 Executive Committee members Vasant Narasimhan (CEO) CHF 1 743 750 175 102 1 318 275 1 318 275 5 605 100 2 449 823 113 841 12 724 166 Aggregate realized compensation of the other 12 Executive Committee members 7 CHF 9 792 833 2 320 106 4 901 015 5 997 169 14 416 662 3 863 980 4 803 881 46 095 647 Total CHF 11 536 583 2 495 208 6 219 290 7 315 444 20 021 762 6 313 803 4 917 722 58 819 813 1 Includes mandatory employer contributions of CHF 8 336 for the CEO and CHF 59 591 for the other Executive Committee members paid by Novartis to governmental social security systems. This amount is out of total employer contributions of CHF 6 088 770 paid in 2020 for all Executive Committee members, and provides a right to the maximum future insured government pension benefit for the Executive Committee members. 2 The portion of the Annual Incentive delivered in equity is rounded up to the nearest share, based on the closing share price on the grant date (January 20, 2021) of CHF 86.01 per Novartis share and USD 96.92 per ADR. 3 The amounts represent the underlying share value of the 245'786 LTPP PSUs and 75'714 LTRPP PSUs vested on January 18, 2021, to the CEO and other Executive Committee members for the performance cycle 2018-2020, inclusive of earned Alcon Keep Whole awards and dividend equivalents for the three-year cycle. The taxable value is determined using the closing share price on the day the Novartis Board of Directors approved the final LTPP and LTRPP performance factors (i.e., January 20, 2021) of CHF 86.01 per Novartis share and Schaffert and Marie-France Tschudin were promoted to the Executive Committee during the course of the performance period 2018-2020, and as such, the information disclosed reflects their pro-rata LTPP and LTRPP 2018-2020 payouts attributable to the period in which they were a member of the Executive Committee. Klaus Moosmayer, John Tsai and Richard Saynor joined Novartis after the 2018 LTI awards being made and hence did not receive LTPP and LTRPP awards for the 2018-2020 performance period. 4 Includes any other perquisites, benefits in kind, international assignment benefits as per the global mobility policy (e.g., housing, international health insurance, children's school fees, tax equalization). The 2020 tax payments for Richard Saynor were CHF 1 181 889 and for Susanne Schaffert were CHF 431 180. 5 Includes 6 128 vested RSUs (CHF 471 666), of which 698 vested on March,13 2020, and 5 430 on July 28, 2020, as well as 4 022 vested PSUs (CHF 281 379) on March 13, 2020, to John Tsai in lieu of the LTI that he forfeited when leaving his previous employer. Also includes 2 421 vested RSUs (USD 229 487) on January 4, 2020, to James Bradner in lieu of the LTI that he forfeited when leaving his previous employer and 6 011 vested PSUs (CHF 550 788) on January 17, 2020, to Klaus Moosmayer in lieu of the LTI he forfeited when leaving his previous employer. Lastly, includes 2 348 vested RSUs (CHF 224 516) and 2 178 vested PSUs (CHF 208 260) on February 15, 2020, to Richard Saynor in lieu of the LTI that he forfeited when leaving his previous employer. The PSUs had the same performance measures as the LTPP for the 2017-2019 performance cycle (NCVA and long-term innovation). 6 All amounts are before deduction of the social security contribution and income tax due by the Executive Committee member. 7 Amounts for Executive Committee members paid in USD were converted at a rate of USD 1.00 = CHF 0.939, which is the same average exchange rate used in the Group's 2020 consolidated financial statements (similar rule applies in case of payments made in other currencies during the year). Realized compensation for the CEO and other Executive Committee members for 2021 compared to 2020 The 2021 total realized compensation for the CEO was CHF 11 224 727. This is a reduction of 11.8% compared to the prior year, mainly due to the lower performance payout of the 2019-2021 LTPP (107% compared to the 126% combined payout 2018-2020 LTPP and LTRPP). During the 2019-2021 LTPP performance cycle, the TSR ranking for Novartis, which is weighted 25% of the overall LTPP opportunity, was below median, which resulted in zero payout for this measure. Long-term Innovation performance, also weighted 25%, was also lower (109% com - pared to 131% in 2018-2020). For more detail, please refer to \"\u2014LTPP performance outcomes.\" The 2021 total realized compensation for the Executive Committee members, including the CEO, was CHF 56 639 891. The small decrease compared to the prior year can be mainly attributed to the lower 2019-2021 LTPP payout com - pared to the 2018-2020 cycle and, to a lesser extent, lower annual incentive payouts on average for Executive Committee members for 2021 compared to the prior performance year. The lower performance payouts were par - tially offset by vesting of the first LTI for some Executive Committee members, granted to them following their respective appointments three years ago. Item 6. Directors, Senior Management and Employees 107Compensation at grant value In accordance with the Swiss Ordinance against Excessive Compensation in Listed Companies, Novartis continues to disclose total compensation at grant value for the CEO and other Executive Committee members. The following tables disclose for the CEO and other Executive Committee members: Fixed 2021 compensation (base salary and benefits) The actual cash portion and the deferred portion granted in equity of the 2021 Annual Incentive 2021-2023 LTPP performance cycle awards, which are reported at target grant date value, under the assumption that the awards will vest at 100% achievement, excluding any share price movement and dividend equivalents that may be accrued over the performance cycle. The future payout will be determined only after the performance cycle concludes in three years (i.e., the end of 2023), with a payout range of 0% to 200% of the target value Other compensation for 2021, which includes other benefits, either paid in cash or granted in equity in the year To assess CEO actual pay for performance in 2021, including the Annual Incentive payout for the 2021 performance year and the LTI payouts for the 2019-2021 performance cycle, shareholders should refer to the 2021 realized compensation table in \"\u20142021 realized compensation for the CEO and other Executive Committee members.\" 2021 compensation at grant value for the CEO and other Executive Committee members Fixed compensation and Variable compensation pension benefits Actual compensation paid or granted for 2021 Long-Term Incentive 2021-2023 cycle grants at target 2021 annual base 2021 pension 2021 Annual Incentive LTPP 2021-2023 cycle Other 2021 Total salary benefits (performance achieved) compensation compensation paid, promised or granted 2021 Equity PSUs Cash Cash (value at (target value Currency (amount) Amount 1 (amount) grant date) 2 at grant date) 3 Amount 4 Amount 5 Executive Committee members active on December 31, 2021 Vasant Narasimhan CHF 1 769 200 176 731 1 328 625 1 328 642 5 757 423 265 401 10 626 023 James Bradner 6 USD 1 184 462 367 246 712 802 712 839 2 970 016 92 286 6 039 652 Karen Hale (from May 15, 2021) 7 CHF 519 750 85 987 261 062 261 133 1 442 371 542 689 3 112 992 Harry Kirsch CHF 1 072 084 177 174 354 255 1 062 820 2 791 111 43 617 5 501 060 Robert Kowalski (from September 1, 2021) 8 CHF 233 333 49 692 105 288 105 360 448 824 180 428 1 122 925 Steffen Lang CHF 780 833 180 413 508 680 763 076 1 570 027 14 430 3 817 459 Klaus Moosmayer CHF 566 667 198 992 253 000 253 004 1 035 044 49 850 2 356 557 Richard Saynor CHF 785 000 190 263 196 500 196 572 1 493 478 416 693 3 278 506 Susanne Schaffert CHF 881 333 180 837 88 250 794 262 2 118 082 856 650 4 919 415 John Tsai CHF 875 834 186 807 306 950 307 012 2 192 567 201 307 4 070 477 Marie-France Tschudin CHF 881 333 164 980 706 000 706 019 2 029 750 - 4 488 083 Robert Weltevreden CHF 673 333 171 352 299 200 299 275 1 292 042 - 2 735 202 Tot al 10 121 211 2 098 866 5 059 259 6 728 657 24 885 096 2 655 408 51 548 498 Executive Committee members who stepped down during 2021 Steven Baert (until June 30, 2021) 9 CHF 400 277 87 753 399 887 - 422 223 1 831 302 3 141 442 Bertrand Bodson (until January 31, 2021) 10 CHF 54 451 15 240 43 485 - - 1 339 471 1 452 647 Shannon Thyme Klinger (until March 15, 2021) 11 CHF 177 102 40 434 - - 279 791 2 018 161 2 515 487 Subtotal 631 830 143 427 443 372 0 702 014 5 188 934 7 109 576 Tot al 10 753 041 2 242 292 5 502 631 6 728 657 25 587 110 7 844 343 58 658 074 Based on assumption of 100% payout at target. Actual payout (0-200% of target) will be known at the end of the three-year cycle in January 2024 See next page for 2020 comparative figures. 1 Includes mandatory employer contributions of CHF 5 498 for the CEO and CHF 53 693 for the other Executive Committee members paid by Novartis to governmental social security systems. This amount is out of total employer contributions of CHF 4 966 397 paid in 2021 for all Executive Committee members, and provides a right to the maximum future insured government pension benefit. 2 The portion of the Annual Incentive delivered in equity is rounded up to the nearest share, based on the closing share price on the grant date (January 26, 2022) of CHF 78.16 per Novartis share and USD 84.24 per ADR. 3 The amounts represent the underlying share value of the target number of PSUs granted to Executive Committee members for the 2021-2023 performance cycle, based on the closing share price on the grant date (January 20, 2021) of CHF 86.01 per Novartis share and USD 96.92 per ADR for all members. 4 Includes any other perquisites, benefits in kind, and international assignment benefits as per the global mobility policy (e.g., housing, international health insurance, children's school fees, tax equalization). The compensation and benefits elements related to the period after the step-down dates are also reported under 'other 2021 compensation'. 5 All amounts are before deduction of the social security contribution and income tax due by the Executive Committee member. 6 Amounts in USD for James Bradner were converted at a rate of CHF 1.00 = USD 1.0942, which is the average rate used in the Group's 2021 consolidated financial statements. 7 Karen Hale received a pro-rata LTPP award of 18 639 PSUs on Apr-2, 2021 (at CHF 81.15 share price at grant) upon joining the organization, as per contractual entitlement. The other compensation amount includes the first six weeks of compensation before her appointment to the Executive Committee. 8 Robert Kowalski received his 2021 LTPP grant before his appointment to Executive Committee, therefore the reported LTPP amount is pro-rated to reflect his time as Executive Committee member over the full performance cycle. 9 Steven Baert left the Executive Committee on June 30, 2021 and ended his notice period on September 30, 2021, in line with his reduced contractual notice period (for more details, see \"\u20142021 Executive Committee member departures\"). He received his 2021 Annual Incentive 100% in cash on a pro-rata basis, and the LTPP grant for the 2021-2023 performance cycle, included in the table above, will vest at the end of the performance cycle on a pro-rata basis subject to the plan rules. 10 Bertrand Bodson left the Executive Committee on January 31, 2021 and ended his notice period on November 30, 2021, in line with his reduced contractual notice period (for more details, see \"\u20142021 Executive Committee member departures\"). He received his 2021 Annual Incentive 100% in cash on a pro-rata basis, and no LTPP was granted for the 2021-2023 performance cycle. 11 Shannon Klinger resigned as Chief Legal Officer as of March 15, 2021, and left the Company on May 31, 2021, in line with her reduced contractual notice period (for more details, see \"\u20142021 Executive Committee member departures\"). The 2021 Annual Incentive and LTPP 2021-2023 cycle grant (23 586 PSUs), displayed at pro-rata value for the time she was in her role in 2021, were forfeited in full upon her departure.Item 6.

This amount is out of total employer contributions of CHF 6 088 770 paid in 2020 for all Executive Committee members, and provides a right to the maximum future insured government pension benefit for the Executive Committee members. 2 The portion of the Annual Incentive delivered in equity is rounded up to the nearest share, based on the closing share price on the grant date (January 20, 2021) of CHF 86.01 per Novartis share and USD 96.92 per ADR. 3 The amounts represent the underlying share value of the target number of PSUs granted to Executive Committee members for the performance cycle 2020-2022, based on the closing share price on the grant date (January 21, 2020) of CHF 92.89 per Novartis share and USD 95.19 per ADR for all members. 4 Includes any other perquisites, benefits in kind, and international assignment benefits as per the global mobility policy (e.g., housing, international health insurance, children's school fees, tax equalization). 5 All amounts are before deduction of the social security contribution and income tax due by the Executive Committee member. 6 Amounts in USD for James Bradner were converted at a rate of CHF 1.00 = USD 1.0649, which is the average rate used in the Group's 2020 consolidated financial statements. Compensation at grant value for the CEO and other Executive Committee members for 2021 compared to 2020 Grant compensation delivered in 2021 to the CEO and the other Executive Committee members, including those who stepped down, remained broadly similar to that in 2020.Item 6.

Directors, Senior Management and Employees 111Share ownership requirements for the CEO and other Executive Committee members Executive Committee members are required to own at least a minimum multiple of their annual base salary in Novartis shares or RSUs within five years of hire or pro - motion, as set out in the table here. In addition, the CEO and CFO are required to hold the equity vesting under the LTPP plan (granted since 2021) for a minimum of two years after the vesting date. In the event of a substantial rise or drop in the share price, the Board of Directors may, at its discretion, amend that time period accord - ingly. FUNCTION OWNERSHIP LEVEL CEO 5 x base compensation Other Executive Committee members 3 x base compensation The determination of equity amounts against the share ownership requirements is defined to include vested and unvested Novartis shares or American Depositary Receipts (ADRs), and RSUs acquired under the Compa - ny's compensation plans. However, unvested PSUs are excluded. The determination also includes other shares and vested options of Novartis shares or ADRs that are owned directly or indirectly by \"persons closely linked\" to an Executive Committee member. The Compensation Committee reviews compliance with the share owner - ship guideline on an annual basis. Shares, ADRs and other equity rights owned by Executive Committee members at December 31, 20211 The following table shows, in alphabetical order after the CEO, the total number of shares, ADRs and other equity rights owned by the CEO and the other Executive Committee members and \"persons closely linked\" to them as of December 31, 2021.

The share price on the final trading day of 2021 was CHF 80.28 / USD 87.47 as at December 31, 2021. 4 The target number of PSUs is disclosed pro-rata to December 31, 2021, unless the award qualified for full vesting under the relevant plan rules.Item 6. Directors, Senior Management and Employees 112Fixed and variable compensation The following table summarizes the annual base salary and variable compensation mix at grant value for finan - cial year 2021 for the CEO and other Executive Commit - tee members. Annual Variable base salary 1 compensation 2 Vasant Narasimhan 16.9% 83.1% James 20.5% 79.5% 1 Excludes pension and other benefits and is pro-rated for ECN time. 2 See the table \"2021 compensation at grant value for the CEO and other Executive Committee members\" with regard to the disclosure principles of variable compensation. 3 Excludes members, who stepped down during the year. Other payments to Executive Committee members During 2021, no other payments or waivers of claims other than those set out in the tables (including their foot - notes) contained in this Compensation Report were made to Executive Committee members or to \"persons closely linked\" to them. Payments to former Executive Committee members Under the former Executive Committee members' contracts and in line with the Company's LTI plan rules, payments were made to 7 former members. Of this, CHF 1 496 357 relates to the vesting of the LTPP 2019- 2021 performance cycle and the vesting of buyout awards. In addition, contractual amounts totalling CHF 150 137 were made (comprising base salary, the Annual Incentive and other benefits), and 5 individuals had tax equalization on their variable compensation granted during an international assignment amounting to a total of CHF 399 593. No other payments (or waivers of claims) were made to former Executive Committee members or to \"persons closely linked\" to them during 2021. Loans to Executive Committee members Our policy does not allow loans to be granted to current or former members of the Executive Committee or to \"persons closely linked\" to them. Therefore, no loans were granted in 2021, and none were outstanding as of December 31, 2021. Persons closely linked \"Persons closely linked\" are (i) their spouse, (ii) their chil - dren below age 18, (iii) any legal entities that they own or otherwise control, and (iv) any legal or natural person who is acting as their fiduciary. Note 27 to the Group's audited consolidated financial statements The total expense for the year for compensation awarded to Executive Committee and Board members, using International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) mea - surement rules, is presented in Note 27 to the Group's audited consolidated financial statements. Award and delivery of equity to Novartis employees During 2021, 11.1 million unvested restricted shares (or ADRs), RSUs and target PSUs were granted, and 10.4 million Novartis vested shares (or ADRs) were delivered to Novartis employees under various equity-based par - ticipation plans. Current unvested equity instruments (restricted shares, RSUs and target PSUs) and outstand - ing equity options held by employees represent 1.21% of issued shares. Novartis delivers treasury shares to employees to fulfill these obligations and aims to offset the dilutive impact from its equity-based participation plans.Item 6. Directors, Senior Management and Employees 113Interim update regarding ongoing L TI performance cycles Below we report how performance is tracking against our stretch targets for our ongoing LTI performance cycles. 2020-2022 L TPP After the first two years of the three-year LTPP perfor - mance cycle, both net sales CAGR and operating income CAGR are tracking behind target, driven mainly by the negative and unexpected impact of COVID-19 in 2020 and 2021 as well as the safety update on Beovu .

Directors, Senior Management and Employees 1142022 Executive Committee compensation 2022 Executive Committee member compensation increases As outlined in \"\u2014Executive Committee appointments compensation policy,\" some members were appointed with total target compensation below external market median level. Each year, we collaborate with our advisors to bench - mark the compensation levels of the members of the Executive Committee. Taking this into consideration and to ensure our competitiveness in the market, the total target compensation for these members has been assessed, and increases have been made for 2022 in line with their demonstrated performance and ability in their respective roles. For the Executive Committee members not outlined below, including the CEO, the compensation review was applied based on the principles applicable to associates in Switzerland and, where applicable, the US. Marie-France T schudin, President of Novartis Pharmaceuticals Ms. Tschudin delivered a very strong year financially in 2021, with growth drivers Cosentyx and Entresto exceed - ing sales targets and continuing to build a strong market share. Targeted launches in the US and Japan were suc - cessful and pre-launch preparation for a number of brands was well executed. Effective March 1, 2022, Ms. Tschudin will receive an increase in annual base salary of 4.8% to CHF 925 000, a 10% increase in her Annual Incentive tar - get to 110% and a 10% increase in target LTI to 240%, as a percentage of annual base salary. Steffen Lang, Global Head of Novartis T echnical Operations Mr. Lang delivered very strong financial and operational performance in 2021. Under his leadership, the Technical Operations function built new capabilities and streamlined processes in our manufacturing activities, while con - tinuing to ensure quality and compliance. Effective March 1, 2022, he will receive an increase in annual base salary of 4.5% to CHF 820 000, a 10% increase in both the target Annual Incentive and LTI to 100% and 210% respec - tively, as a percentage of his annual base salary. Robert Weltevreden, Head of Customer & T echnology Solutions Mr. Weltevreden's role was expanded in February 2021 when we merged our Digital function with our business ser - vices. To recognize these additional responsibilities and his strong delivery of improved efficiencies across the organization, Mr. Weltevreden will receive a 10% increase in both the target Annual Incentive and LTI to 90% and 200% respectively, as a percentage of his annual base salary. Susanne Schaffert, President of Novartis Oncology Ms. Schaffert led strong performance of our inline Oncology brands in 2021 and took important strategic decisions to focus on key cancers through targeted therapy programs. Ms. Schaffert will receive a 10% increase to her 2022 Annual Incentive target to 110%, as a percentage of annual base salary. Klaus Moosmayer, Chief Ethics, Risk & Compliance Officer Mr. Moosmayer has continued to drive the ethical transformation of the company, establishing a robust approach to the active management of risks and compliance, as demonstrated to external regulators. Mr. Moosmayer will receive a 10% increase to his 2022 Annual Incentive target, to 90%, as a percentage of annual base salary.Item 6. Directors, Senior Management and Employees 1152021 Board compensation Philosophy and benchmarking Aligned with market practice in Switzerland, the Board of Directors sets compensation for its members at a level that allows for the attraction of high-caliber individuals, including both Swiss and international members, who have global experience. Board members do not receive variable compensa - tion, in line with their focus on corporate strategy, super - vision and governance. Each year at the AGM, share - holders are requested to approve, in a binding vote, the total compensation of the Board of Directors until the following AGM. The Board of Directors sets the level of compensa - tion for its Chairman and the other members to be in line with relevant benchmark companies, which include other large Switzerland-based multinational companies: ABB, Credit Suisse, Holcim, Nestl\u00e9, Roche and UBS. This peer group was chosen for Board compensation due to the comparability of Swiss legal requirements, including broad personal and individual liabilities under Swiss law (and criminal liability under Swiss rules regarding board and executive committee compensation related to the Ordinance against Excessive Compensation in Listed Companies), and under US law (due to the Company's secondary listing on the New York Stock Exchange). The Board of Directors reviews the compensation of its mem - bers, including the Chairman, each year based on a pro - posal by the Compensation Committee and on advice from its independent advisor, including relevant bench - marking information. The peer group used for the Board of Directors is different than that used for the Executive Committee to ensure independence of decision-making. The Chairman's contract and the Board of Directors compensation policy do not provide for any termina - tion-related payments. Chairman of the Board As Chairman, Joerg Reinhardt receives total annual com - pensation valued at CHF 3.8 million. The total compen - sation is comprised equally of cash and shares, as fol - lows: Cash compensation: CHF 1.9 million per year Share compensation: annual value equal to CHF 1.9 million of unrestricted Novartis shares For 2021, the Chairman voluntarily waived the increase in compensation to which he is contractually entitled, which is an amount not lower than the average annual compensation increase awarded to employees based in Switzerland (1.0% for 2021). Other Board members The annual fee rates for Board membership and addi - tional functions are included in the table below. These were approved by the Board of Directors with effect from the 2021 AGM. Aggregate Board compensation is aligned with other large Swiss companies. 2021-2022 AGM CHF 000s annual fee Chairman of the Board 3 800 Board membership 280 Vice Chairman 50 Chair of the Audit and Compliance Committee 130 Chair of the Compensation Committee 90 Chair of the following committees: Governance, Nomination and Corporate Responsibilities Committee Science & Technology Committee Risk Committee 70 Membership of the Audit and Compliance Committee 70 Membership of the following committees: Compensation Committee Governance, Nomination and Corporate Responsibilities Committee Science & Technology Committee Risk Committee 40 In addition, the following policies apply regarding Board compensation: 50% of compensation is delivered in cash, paid on a quarterly basis in arrears. Board members may choose to receive more of their compensation in shares instead of cash. At least 50% of compensation is delivered in shares in two installments: one six months after the AGM, and one 12 months after the AGM. Board members bear the full cost of their employee social security contributions, if any, and do not receive share options or pension benefits. 2022 Board compensation The Board of Directors fee levels will remain the same in 2022 with one exception. Since the 2021 AGM, the roles of Vice Chairman and Lead Independent Director (LID) have been held by the same Board member and no additional compensation was paid for the LID role. From the 2022 AGM, the roles will be held by separate Board members. For more information on the roles, please refer to \"\u2014Vice Chairman and Lead Independent Director\" in Item 6.C of this Annual Report. The Board has approved an annual fixed fee of CHF 20 000 for the LID role. As per the Board compensa - tion policy, at least 50% of the fee will be paid in Novartis shares and the remainder will be paid in cash. When determining the compensation principles and the amount, the designated LID candidate was excused from any dis - cussion.Item 6.

Directors, Senior Management and Employees 119Compensation governance Legal framework The Swiss Code of Obligations and the corporate gover - nance guidelines of the SIX Swiss Exchange require listed companies to disclose certain information about the com - pensation of board and executive committee members, their equity participation, and loans made to them. This Annual Report fulfills that requirement. In addition, the Annual Report is in line with the principles of the Swiss Code of Best Practice for Corporate Governance of the Swiss Business Federation (economiesuisse). Risk management principles The Compensation Committee, with support from its independent advisor, reviews market trends in compen - sation, and changes in corporate governance rules and best practices. Together with the Risk Committee, it also reviews the Novartis compensation systems to ensure that they do not encourage inappropriate or excessive risk-taking, and instead encourage behaviors that sup - port sustainable value creation. A summary of the risk management principles is outlined below. Executive Committee employment contracts provide for a notice period of up to 12 months and contain no change- of-control clauses or severance provisions (for example, agreements concerning special notice periods, lon - ger-term contracts, \"golden parachutes,\" waiver of lockup periods for equities and bonds, shorter vesting periods, and additional contributions to occupational pension schemes). For share ownership requirements, please refer to \"\u2014Share ownership requirements for the CEO and other Executive Committee members.\" Compensation decision-making authorities Authority for decisions related to compensation is gov - erned by the Articles of Incorporation, Board Regulations and the Compensation Committee Charter, which are all published on the Company website: www.novartis.com/investors/company-overview/corporate-governance.

A summary of discussions and conclusions of each committee meeting is delivered to the full Board of Directors. A summary of the compen - sation decision-making authorities is set out below.

Role of the Compensation Committee's independent advisor The Compensation Committee retained Mercer Limited during the financial year 2021 as its independent external compensation advisor to support the committee in determin - ing the design and implementation of compensation and ben - efits. The advisor from Mercer Limited was hired directly by the Compensation Committee in 2017, and the Compensa - tion Committee has been fully satisfied with the performance and independence of the advisor since its engagement. In determining whether to renew the engagement with the advi - sor, the Compensation Committee evaluates, at least annu - ally, the quality of the consulting service, the independence of the advisor, and the benefits of rotating advisors. Mercer Limited also provides services related to management devel - opment at the mid- and frontline leader level and in respect of corporate pensions. The independent advisor and his team that advises and supports the committee are not responsible or rewarded for work beyond support to the Compensation Committee and the People & Organization function on senior compensation.

Voting rights, restrictions and representation REGISTRATION Shareholders have the right to vote and to execute all other rights as granted under Swiss law and the Articles of Incorporation (see, in particular, articles 17 and 18 of the Articles of Incorporation). Each share registered with the right to vote by the third business day before the General Meeting entitles the holder to one vote at General Meetings. Article 5, paragraph 2 of the Articles of Incorporation provides that to be registered with voting rights, a shareholder must declare that he or she acquired the shares in his or her own name and for his or her own account. According to article 5, paragraph 3 of the Articles of Incorporation, the Board may register nominees with the right to vote. The Share Register is an internal, non-public register subject to statutory confidentiality and data privacy. The Articles of Incorporation are available at www. novartis.com/investors/company-overview/corpo - rate-governance. REGISTRATION RESTRICTIONS Article 5, paragraph 2 of the Articles of Incorporation provides that no shareholder shall be registered with the right to vote for more than 2% of the share capital. Given that shareholder representation at General Meetings traditionally has been rather low in Switzerland, Novartis AG considers registra - tion restrictions necessary to prevent a minority shareholder from dominating a General Meeting. The Board may, upon request, grant an exemption. Considerations include whether the shareholder supports our goal of creating sustainable value and has a long-term investment horizon. Exemptions are in force for the registered shareholders listed in \"\u2014Item 6.C Board practices\u2014Group structure and shareholders\u2014 Shareholders\u2014Significant shareholders.\" Exemptions also apply to the Novartis Foundation for Employee Participa - tion, Basel, which as of December 31, 2021, was registered in the Share Register with less than 2% of the share capital, and to Norges Bank (Central Bank of Norway), Oslo, which as of December 31, 2021, was not registered but held 2.1% according to a disclosure notification filed with Novartis AG. No further exemptions were requested in 2021. The same restrictions indirectly apply to ADR holders. Article 5, paragraph 3 of the Articles of Incorporation provides that no nominee shall be registered with the right to vote for more than 0.5% of the registered share capital. The Board may, upon request, grant an exemption from this restriction if the nominee discloses the names, addresses and number of shares of the persons for whose account it holds 0.5% or more of the registered share capital. Exemp - tions are in force for the nominees listed in \"\u2014Item 6.C Board Item 6. Directors, Senior Management and Employees 127practices\u2014Group structure and shareholders\u2014Sharehold - ers\u2014Significant shareholders,\" and for the nominee Citibank, London, which in 2015 requested an exemption, but as of December 31, 2021, was not registered in the Share Regis - ter. The same restrictions indirectly apply to ADR holders. According to article 5, paragraph 4 of the Articles of Incorporation, shareholders, ADR holders, or nominees who are linked to each other or who act in concert to circumvent registration restrictions are treated as one person or nom - inee for the purposes of the restrictions on registration. The registration restrictions may be changed by res - olution of the General Meeting, with approval of at least two-thirds of the votes represented at the meeting. The Articles of Incorporation are available at www. novartis.com/investors/company-overview/corpo - rate-governance. REPRESENTATION AND ONLINE VOTING PLATFORM Registered shareholders will receive personal invitations to the General Meetings along with a registration/proxy form as well as a personal one-time password and a QR code to log in to our online voting platform. By returning the registration/proxy form or using the online voting platform, shareholders would normally be able to order an admission card for the General Meeting or appoint another shareholder or the Independent Proxy to vote their shares on their behalf. However, in accordance with Swiss legislation passed in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, physical attendance at the 2021 Annual General Meeting (AGM) was not possible, and shareholders could exercise their voting rights only through the Independent Proxy. Due to the challenging and unpredictable situation regarding COVID-19, the Board decided in December 2021 to also hold the 2022 AGM without shareholders being physically present. If the Independent Proxy is appointed, shareholders can also give voting instructions on alternative or addi - tional motions related to the agenda items either (i) fol - lowing the recommendations of the Board for such alter - native or additional motions, or (ii) opposing such alternative or additional motions. They can also abstain from voting. Shareholders choosing not to receive the compre - hensive invitation materials will be informed of upcoming General Meetings through a letter containing the login credentials to access the online platform as well as a ref - erence to www.novartis.com/investors/shareholder-in - formation/general-meetings, where all relevant informa - tion is available. ADR HOLDERS ADR holders have the rights enumerated in the deposit agreement (such as the right to give voting instruc - tions and to receive dividends). The ADS depositary of Novartis AG - JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., New York - holds the shares underlying the ADRs and is registered as a shareholder in the Share Register. An ADR is not a share, and an ADR holder is not a Novartis AG shareholder. Each ADR represents one share. ADR holders exercise their voting rights by instructing the depositary to exer - cise their voting rights. The ADS depositary exercises the voting rights for registered shares underlying ADRs for which no voting instructions have been given by pro - viding a discretionary proxy to an uninstructed indepen - dent designee. Such designee has to be a shareholder.General Meeting CONVENING The AGM must be held within six months after the end of our financial year (December 31), and normally takes place in late February/early March. Extraordinary General Meet - ings may be requested by the Board, the external auditor, or shareholders representing at least 10% of the share capital. AGENDA Shareholders representing shares with an aggregate nominal value of at least CHF 1 million may request that an item be included in a General Meeting agenda. Such requests must be made in writing at least 45 days before the meeting, specifying the requested item and proposal. POWERS According to article 17 of the Articles of Incorporation (www.novartis.com/investors/company-overview/corpo - rate-governance), the following powers are vested exclu - sively in the General Meeting: Adoption and amendment of the Articles of Incorporation Election and removal of the Chairman, the Board and Compensation Committee members, the Independent Proxy and the external auditor Approval of the management report and of the consol - idated financial statements Approval of the financial statements of Novartis AG, and decision on the appropriation of available earn - ings shown on the balance sheet, including dividends Approval of the maximum aggregate compensation of the Board (from an AGM until the next AGM) and of the Executive Committee (for the financial year following the AGM). If the maximum aggregate amount of com - pensation already approved by the AGM is not sufficient to cover the compensation of newly appointed or pro - moted Executive Committee members, Novartis may use up to 40% of the amount last approved for the newly appointed or promoted Executive Committee members. Discharge of Board and Executive Committee members Decision on other matters that are reserved by law or by the Articles of Incorporation (e.g., advisory vote on the Compensation Report) to the General Meeting STATUTORY QUORUMS The General Meeting passes resolutions and elections with the absolute majority of the votes represented at the meet - ing. However, under article 18 of the Articles of Incorpora - tion (www.novartis.com/investors/company-overview/ corporate-governance), the approval of two-thirds of the votes represented at the meeting is required for: Alteration of the purpose of Novartis AG Creation of shares with increased voting powers Implementation of restrictions on the transfer of registe red shares, and the removal of such restrictions Authorized or conditional increase of the share capital Increase of the share capital out of equity, by contribution in kind, for the purpose of an acquisition of property or the grant of special rights Restriction or cancellation of subscription rights Change of the registered office of Novartis AG Dissolution of Novartis AG In addition, the law provides for a qualified majority for other resolutions, such as a merger or demerger.Composition (as per December 31, 2021) CHAIRMAN: J.

Directors, Senior Management and Employees 128Board of Directors Changes to the Board of Directors Srikant Datar, Board member since 2003, did not stand for re-election at the 2021 AGM following his appoint - ment as dean of Harvard Business School in the US. Mr. Datar's CV can be found in the 2020 Annual Report (page 136), available at www.novartis.com/media-library/novar - tis-annual-report-2020. Election and term of office Board members (including the Chairman) and Com - pensation Committee members are elected individually by shareholders at the General Meeting for a one-year term of office. The term of office expires at the end of the next AGM. As adopted by the 2021 AGM, the previous age limit set forth in the Articles of Incorporation was replaced by a term limit. Accordingly, a member shall not serve on the Board for more than 12 years. Under special circum - stances and if deemed to be in the best interest of the Company, the Board may recommend exceptions to the shareholders (see article 20, paragraph 3 of the Articles of Incorporation: www.novartis.com/investors/compa - ny-overview/corporate-governance). The term limit supports our commitment to renew the Board on an ongoing basis. It also follows international best practice, which increasingly asks for an overall tenure of no more than 12 years. We believe age is still a relevant factor in Board composition, and the GNCRC will consider this and other factors - including gender, nationality and ethnicity - when evaluating candidates and exploring ways to increase Board diversity.Succession planning The Chairman, supported by the GNCRC, ensures effec - tive succession plans for the Board, the CEO and the Executive Committee. These plans are discussed by the Board in private meetings. A search for a new Board mem - ber is launched - normally with the support of a profes - sional executive search company - with individual selec - tion criteria defined based on the evolving needs of the Company and a continuing focus on diversity. The set of competencies (further explained in \"\u2014Item 6.C Board practices\u2014Board of Directors\u2014Board skills\") is also an important criterion for the GNCRC when evaluating new candidates. Candidates are interviewed by the Chair - man, members of the GNCRC, other Board members, and members of the Executive Committee. The GNCRC then makes a recommendation to the full Board, and the Board ultimately decides who should be proposed for election at the upcoming AGM. The Board will propose to the shareholders Ana de Pro Gonzalo as new Board member for election at the 2022 AGM. Andreas von Planta already announced that he will not stand for re-election at the 2023 AGM. To ensure an orderly transition, the Board will also propose the re-election of Mr. von Planta by granting an excep - tion pursuant to article 20, paragraph 3 of the Articles of Incorporation, as he will exceed the 12-year term limit introduced last year.

Directors, Senior Management and Employees 129 Independence All Board members - including the Chairman - are non - executive and independent, pursuant to applicable corpo - rate governance rules and Novartis independence criteria, which are outlined in Appendix II to the Board Regula - tions (www.novartis.com/investors/company-overview/ corporate-governance). In particular, no Board member is or was a member of the management of Novartis AG or of any other Novartis Group company in the last three financial years up to December 31, 2021, or has a signifi - cant business relationship with Novartis AG or with any other Novartis Group company. Because all Board mem - bers are independent, no separate meetings of indepen - dent Board members were held in 2021. Independence is assessed annually. Each Board mem - ber completes an independence questionnaire that is subject to review by the GNCRC. The GNCRC then sub - mits a proposal to the full Board, and the Board deter - mines the independence status of each Board member.Diversity Diversity of culture, experience and opinion is a key fac - tor to success and Board effectiveness. A diverse Board ensures that the appropriate balance of skills, expertise and experience is represented to discharge responsibilities to shareholders, and helps create long-term value. We are continuously looking for opportunities to increase our Board diversity, including gender, age, nationality and ethnicity. The female representation on our Board cur - rently amounts to 31%. The GNCRC is focused on achiev - ing even greater diversity when identifying new Board member candidates. Board skills Upon proposal by the GNCRC, the Board has determined a diverse set of competencies for its members that aligns with our status as a listed company as well as our busi - ness portfolio, geographic reach and culture. Based on this set of competencies, our Board members were asked to identify their most relevant skills highlighted by their educational background, professional experience and personal achievements. The GNCRC assesses the set of competencies as well as the individual skills annually to ensure that an appropriate balance of skills, expertise, experience and diversity is represented on the Board.

A report identifying key strengths and challenges is produced for the Board and its committees. Qualitative review Based on the results, the Chairman and the committee chairs each lead a qualitative review with their colleagues and then with the entire Board. In addition, the Board, without its Chairman, discusses the Chairman's performance, and then provides him with feedback. Outcome The last self-assessment of November 2021 determined that the Board and its committees are functioning effectively and efficiently. The feedback confirmed that the Board has an open culture, fostering a broad range of viewpoints. The results also identified key areas on which to focus, such as further development of the Group strategy, oversight of a range of challenging technology projects, and the impact on persistent pricing pressure in the US and Europe.Item 6. Directors, Senior Management and Employees 137Self-assessment The Board and its committees conduct a self-assess - ment once a year, covering topics including Board compo - sition, purpose, scope and responsibilities; Board processes and governance; Board meetings and pre-reading material; team effectiveness; and Chairman and peer evaluation. Every third year, this process is conducted by an independent external consultant. This last happened in 2020 with the consulting firm Egon Zehnder. T rainings Our Board receives regular briefings and trainings on ethics, risks and compliance, and other relevant topics. In 2021, each Board member completed the following e-learning courses: Diversity & Inclusion Adverse Events Fit to Commit, focusing on our ethical commitments around our Professional Practices Policy (P3), insider trading, data privacy, and digital engagement for per - sonal use Our Chief Legal Officer also provides regular updates to our Board members on developments related to insider trading laws and regulations, and annually briefs the mem - bers of the Board and the Executive Committee on their insider trading duties.

Role of the Board and its committees The Board is responsible for the overall direction and oversight of management, and holds the ultimate decision-making authority, with the exception of deci - sions reserved for shareholders. The Board has delegated certain of its duties and responsibilities to its five committees led by a Board-elected committee chair, as set out in the Board Regulations (www. novartis.com/investors/company-overview/corporate-gov - ernance). In some cases, these responsibilities are of an advisory or preparatory nature (A/P). In other cases, the committee has decision-making power that is subject to final Board approval (FBA), or the responsibilities have been fully delegated to the committee (FD). All commit - tees have the authority to retain external consultants. Any Board member may request a Board or committee meeting and the inclusion of an agenda item. Before meetings, Board members receive materials to help them prepare the discussions and decision-making. Item 6.

Directors, Senior Management and Employees 150Information and control systems The Board's information and control systems vis-\u00e0-vis management include a steady flow of information from senior management; monthly financial reports; a compre - hensive and integrated risk management framework; an integrated assurance framework; and the independent evaluation of our risk management and internal control framework by Internal Audit, a function of Novartis Busi - ness Assurance & Advisory (NBAA) (see \"Item 15. Con - trols and Procedures\"). Information from senior management The Board ensures that it receives sufficient information from the Executive Committee through: Monthly CEO reporting (including detailed written updates from each division and business unit head), frequent communications from the CEO on current developments, and a yearly presentation Executive Committee meeting minutes Regular meetings/teleconferences by the Board and/or Board committees with the CEO and/or other members of the Executive Committee (e.g., the CFO, the Chief Legal Officer, the Chief Ethics, Risk & Compliance Offi - cer), and regular meetings/teleconferences with senior management (e.g., the Global Head of NBAA and Head of Internal Audit) Information from Executive Committee members or other Novartis employees, and visits to Novartis sites To get an outside view, the Board and/or Board com - mittees occasionally invite external advisors (e.g., the independent advisor of the Compensation Committee, the external auditor) to attend a meeting and/or repre - sent a specific topic.Monthly financial reports Novartis produces comprehensive, consolidated (unau - dited) financial statements on a monthly basis for the Group and its operating divisions. These are typically available within 10 days after the end of the month, and include the following: Consolidated income statement of the month and year to date, in accordance with International Financial Report - ing Standards (IFRS), as well as adjustments to arrive at core results, as defined by Novartis (see \"Item 5. Operating and Financial Review and Prospects\u2014Item 5.A Operating results\u2014Non-IFRS measures as defined by Novartis\"). The IFRS and core figures are compared to the prior-year period and targets in both USD and on a constant currency basis. Supplementary data on a monthly and year-to-date basis, such as free cash flow and earnings per share on a USD basis Management information related to the consolidated income statements and free cash flow is made available to Board members through the monthly CEO Report, including an analysis of key deviations from the prior year or target. Prior to the release of each quarter's results, the Board receives the actual consolidated financial statement infor - mation and an outlook of the full-year results in accor - dance with IFRS and core results (as defined by Novartis), together with related commentary. Annually, in the middle of the year, the Board approves the Company's strategic plan for the next three years. In the fourth quarter of the year, the Board approves the operating targets for the following year as well as the financial targets for the following three-year period, including a projected consolidated income statement in USD prepared in accordance with IFRS and non-IFRS measures as defined by Novartis (core results). The Board does not have direct access to the Novartis financial and management reporting systems but can, at any time, request more detailed information.Item 6. Directors, Senior Management and Employees 151Risk management Overview At Novartis, our continued success depends on our abil - ity to manage risk. Our Board has ultimate oversight of the Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) system and reg - ularly reviews the most significant risks and how these risks are managed. As further explained below, the Board is supported by its committees. Furthermore, our Inter - nal Audit function provides an independent evaluation of risk management (see \"\u2014Item 6.C Board practices\u2014Infor - mation and control systems\u2014Novartis Business Assur - ance & Advisory\"). BOARD COMMITTEES RISK COMMITTEE Oversees the risk management system and processes Reviews, together with management, the prioritization and handling of risks, the risk portfolio, and actions implemented by management Performs deep dives into key risk areas and fosters a culture of smart risk-taking Receives updates at its four annual meetings from designated risk owners as well as the Chief Ethics, Risk & Compliance Officer and/ or the Head of Risk & Resilience AUDIT AND COMPLIANCE COMMITTEE Ensures that Internal Audit plans are aligned with key risks and that the function provides independent assurance and insights around these risks Works closely with the Risk Committee to minimize gaps in risk coverage Reviews the integrated assurance report with the Chief Ethics, Risk & Compliance Officer and the Global Head of NBAA and Head of Internal Audit Receives a biannual presentation from the Chief Ethics, Risk & Compliance Officer Receives a quarterly presentation from the Global Head of NBAA and Head of Internal Audit on the progress of the risk-based audit plan and key insights from audit and advisory activities Pays particular attention to financial risk Has closed sessions individually with the Global Head of NBAA and Head of Internal Audit and, upon request, with the Chief Ethics, Risk & Compliance Officer COMPENSATION COMMITTEE Works closely with the Risk Committee to ensure that the compensation system does not lead to excessive risk-taking (see \"\u2014Item 6.B Compensation\u2014Compensation governance\u2014 Risk management OF NOVARTIS Regularly assesses risks and fosters a culture of risk awareness, in line with the Novartis Values and Behaviors and the Novartis Code of Ethics ETHICS, RISK & COMPLIANCE Governs the Novartis Code of Ethics Provides an integrated ERM framework (further described in the following section) Governs the global compliance program within Novartis Administers the Enterprise Policy Management and global Internal Controls framework SENIOR LEADERS OF DIVISIONS, ORGANIZATIONAL UNITS AND GROUP FUNCTIONS, AT ALL LEVELS Provide appropriate risk management within their area of responsibility Establish adequate risk prevention and mitigation strategies when risk exposure is identified, including tracking progress and providing resources for possible actions Assess emerging risks, trends and overall exposure as part of the ERM processEnterprise Risk Management framework The Ethics, Risk & Compliance (ERC) function provides an integrated ERM framework to obtain a holistic view of Company risks and drive a culture of smart risk-taking. Under the leadership of the Chief Ethics, Risk & Compli - ance Officer, the Risk & Resilience team is responsible for the overall ERM process. This process covers, but is not limited to covering, risks associated with: The research, development, manufacturing, marketing and sales of products Finance; taxes; intellectual property; compliance with law and regulations; security; product safety; human resources; and health, safety and environmental protection Business objectives and strategies, including mergers and acquisitions External factors such as the social, political and eco - nomic environment The ERM process continued to evolve in 2021. The Risk & Resilience team conducted risk workshops and col - laborated with all risk assurance/monitoring functions to identify key risks across the Company. Each Novartis unit organized a focused risk workshop at the leadership team level. In parallel, risk workshops were held in the top 11 countries (by revenue) and in certain focus mar - kets. Once key risks were identified, mitigation action plans were created to effectively address them. The find - ings from these workshops were consolidated into the Novartis Risk Compass, which enables senior manage - ment, the Executive Committee and the Board to focus discussions on key risks and more closely align our corpo - rate strategy with our risk exposure and ways of working. In 2021, we further matured our ERM framework within the Novartis Risk & Resilience organization, developed additional risk management trainings, and integrated other critical risk management functions (like Third-Party Risk Management) into the Risk & Resilience department. Furthermore, a new team was established to coordinate and harmonize monitoring activities across the Company. The Enterprise Policy Management and Internal Control teams are progressing as planned to generate a holistic framework.Recurring observations relate to: 3Data governance and management; oversight of digital initiatives 3Third-party management, including subcontracting oversight 3Design of some commercial and R&D processes, and cross-functional collaboration over complex programs, such as Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) implementation 3Patient support program, including monitoring of external service providersAUDITS 46 ADVISORIES 14INTERNAL REVIEWS 102021 INTERNAL AUDIT ACTIVITIES AND OBSERV A TIONSItem 6. Directors, Senior Management and Employees 152Novartis Business Assurance & Advisory NBAA brings together the independent functions of Global Security and Internal Audit, with Quality, Data Analytics, Operations and Strategy (QDOS) as their sup - port and excellence function. It provides the business, management and Board with protection, independent advice and assurance so Novartis can better manage risks and opportunities, make more informed decisions, and achieve its objectives. NBAA also proactively shares insights through learnings from audits, advisories, reviews, investigations and anti-counterfeit activities to enable the business to better detect and address emerging risks, trends and developments. SpeakUp Office Our SpeakUp Office provides a safe place for employ - ees to report potential misconduct. They have the option to do so anonymously. The SpeakUp Office moved from NBAA to ERC in 2021 to further support an integrated and holistic compliance system. Internal Audit The purpose of Internal Audit is to assist the Board and the Executive Committee in discharging their gover - nance responsibilities by providing independent assur - ance and advice on the effectiveness, efficiency and ade - quacy of processes and controls that support Novartis in achieving its objectives, managing its major risks, and ensuring compliance with applicable policies, laws and regulations. The Internal Audit function executes the risk-based annual audit plan approved by the Audit and Compliance Committee (ACC) at the Group and entity levels, and reports the results to the audited units, the Executive Committee and the ACC (in the form of for - mal quarterly updates). Potential material irregularities are escalated to the ACC and to the SpeakUp Office for triage and possible investigation, and action plans are developed together with the audited units. Moreover, Internal Audit conducts follow-up for high-risk findings prior to the due date for remediation actions. Overdue high-risk findings are reported to the ACC on a quarterly basis. If the audit opinion is \"needs major improvement,\" a follow-up audit takes place the next year. Audit findings and action plans are stored and monitored in a single application to enable efficient follow-up. In 2021, a larger proportion of the plan was focused on assurance in comparison to 2020, with good cover - age of ERM Group risks as well as emerging topics includ - ing digital, gene therapies and business continuity man - agement. More flexibility and agility were built into the plan, meaning Internal Audit could respond to new risks and business requests throughout the year, adding ten new engagements and progressing toward its real-time assurance aspiration. The following outlines the number of audits, internal reviews and advisories performed in 2021, and key topics repeatedly observed. Internal Audit performed 100% of planned activities (equating to 70 engagements) in 2021, most conducted remotely, despite the obstacles created by COVID-19. These engagements comprised 46 audits, 14 advisories and 10 internal reviews covering the entire value chain of Novartis and key strategic and operational risks. Inter - nal Audit has developed a hybrid model for engagement delivery, choosing between remote and in-person auditing based on the engagement scope and COVID-19 situation within the audited entity. NBAA and ERC continue to work toward integrated assurance by improving collaboration across all Novartis risk and assurance/monitoring providers. This includes the coordination of internal plans; alignment on terminology (e.g., root cause analysis) and risk areas; development of the integrated assurance map with aligned messag - ing and reporting; and increased communication around potential issues and risks. On a quarterly basis, to increase the level of assurance provided, NBAA reports to the ACC and the Executive Committee on key insights from all risk and monitoring functions, including key risks iden - tified, emerging trends and monitoring coverage, com - paring it with the Internal Audit insights. Global Security Global Security proactively collects and shares threat intel - ligence to protect Novartis from situations that may com - promise the safety of people, products and assets, and the reputation of our organization. Global Security pro - tects patients from counterfeit products and, as part of the SpeakUp process, performs fair and timely investigations into high-risk cases of alleged internal misconduct. It also provides personal security advice and support for Novartis executives and other employees with utmost discretion. NBAA leadership Our Global Head of NBAA and Head of Internal Audit reports administratively to the CEO, and functionally to the Chair of the ACC, and meets with the latter and the Chairman at least quarterly. She is a standing guest at the Executive Committee meetings. She has full access to the ACC and the Chairman, and confirms the orga - nizational independence of the Internal Audit function annually to the ACC.Item 6. Directors, Senior Management and Employees 153Auditors Duration of the mandate and terms of office On behalf of the Board, the ACC selects and nominates an independent auditor for election at the AGM. PwC assumed its existing auditing mandate for Novartis in 1996. Claudia Benz, auditor in charge, began serving in her role in 2021, and Kris Muller, global relationship part - ner, began serving in her role in 2019. The ACC together with PwC ensure that these partners are rotated at least every five years. Auditing fees and additional fees The ACC monitors and preapproves the fees paid to the external auditor for all audit and non-audit services. It has developed and approved a policy with clear guidelines on the engagement of the independent auditor firm. This policy is designed to help ensure that the independence of the external auditor is maintained. It limits the scope of services that the external auditor may provide to the Group, stipulating certain permissible types of audit-related and non-audit services, including tax services and other ser - vices that have been preapproved by the ACC. The ACC preapproves all other services on a case-by-case basis. The external auditor is required to report periodically to the ACC about the scope of the services it has pro - vided to the Group and the fees for the services it has performed to date. PwC fees for professional services related to the 12-month periods ended December 31, 2021, and December 31, 2020, are as follows: 2021 2020 USD million USD million Audit services 22.2 20.5 Audit-related services 1.5 1.4 Tax services 0.1 0.4 Other services 1.4 1.2 Total 25.2 23.5 Audit services include work performed to issue opinions on consolidated financial statements and parent company financial statements of Novartis AG, to issue opinions related to the effectiveness of the Group's internal control over financial reporting, and to issue reports on local statutory financial statements. Also included are audit services that generally can only be provided by the statutory auditor, such as the audit of the Compensation Report, audits of the adoption of new accounting policies, audits of infor - mation systems and the related control environment, as well as reviews of quarterly financial results.Audit-related services include other assurance services provided by the independent auditor but not restricted to those that can only be provided by the statutory auditor. They include services such as audits of pension and other employee benefit plans; audits in connection with non-recurring transactions; contract audits of third-party arrangements; corporate responsibility assurance; and other audit-related services. Tax services represent tax compliance, assistance with historical tax matters, and other tax-related services. Other services include procedures related to corpo - rate integrity agreements, benchmarking studies, and license fees for use of accounting and other reporting guidance databases. Information to the Board and the ACC The ACC, acting on behalf of the Board, is responsible for overseeing the activities of the external auditor. In 2021, this committee held eight meetings. PwC was invited to all of these meetings to attend the discussions on audit - ing matters and any other matters relevant to its audit. The ACC recommended to the Board to approve the audited consolidated financial statements and the separate parent company financial statements of Novartis AG for the year ended December 31, 2021. The Board proposed the acceptance of these financial statements for approval by the shareholders at the next AGM. The ACC regularly evaluates the performance of the external auditor and, based on this, once a year deter - mines whether the external auditor should be proposed to the shareholders for re-election. To assess the per - formance of the external auditor, the ACC holds private meetings with the CFO and the Global Head of NBAA and Head of Internal Audit and, if necessary, obtains an independent external assessment. Criteria applied for the performance assessment of the external auditor include an evaluation of its technical and operational competence; its independence and objectivity; the suf - ficiency of the resources it has employed; its focus on areas of significant risk to Novartis; its willingness to probe and challenge; its ability to provide effective, prac - tical recommendations; and the openness and effective - ness of its communications and coordination with the ACC, the Internal Audit function and management. Once a year, the auditor in charge and the global relationship partner report to the Board on the external auditor's activities during the current year and on the audit plan for the coming year. On an annual basis, the external auditor provides the ACC with written disclosures required by the US Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, and the commit - tee and the external auditor discuss the external audi - tor's independence from Novartis. Item 6. Directors, Senior Management and Employees 154Auditor tender process In April 2020, upon proposal by the ACC, the Board decided to invite several audit firms, including PwC, to participate in a tender process that would lead to the selection of an external auditor to be proposed for elec - tion at the 2022 AGM. The audit tender was conducted through a fair, transparent and balanced process accord - ing to defined selection criteria under a strong gover - nance structure, ensuring that all audit firms had equal access to management and information. Based on the results of this tendering process, the ACC shortlisted two firms and, based on the assessment of those two firms against the selection criteria, the Board decided to propose to the shareholders at the 2022 AGM the election of KPMG as the external auditor commencing for the 2022 financial year. If KPMG is elected as our new external auditor at the 2022 AGM, PwC's mandate as our external auditor will end at the conclusion of the 2022 AGM, and KPMG will serve as our external auditor for the 2022 financial year.Item 6.

Major Shareholders and Related Party Transactions 7.A Major shareholders Novartis shares are widely held. As of December 31, 2021, Novartis had approximately 186 000 shareholders listed in the Novartis Share Register, representing approximately 66.3% of issued shares. Based on the Novartis Share Register and excluding treasury shares, approximately 46.2% of the shares registered by name were held in Switzerland, and approximately 23.6% were held in the US. Approximately 15.1% of the shares regis - tered in our share register were held by individual inves - tors, while approximately 35.7% were held by legal enti - ties (excluding 4.0% of our share capital held as treasury shares by Novartis AG or its fully owned subsidiaries), and 49.2% were held by nominees, fiduciaries and the ADS depositary.Based on our share register, we believe that we are not directly or indirectly owned or controlled by another corporation or government, or by any other natural or legal persons. There are no arrangements that may result in a change of control. The tables below set forth information with respect to our major shareholders according to our share regis - ter as of December 31, 2021, excluding 4.0% of our share capital held as treasury shares by Novartis AG or its fully owned subsidiaries. The following registered sharehold - ers (including nominees and the ADS depositary) held more than 2% of the total share capital of Novartis with the right to vote all their Novartis shares based on an exemption granted by the Board of Directors: % of respective share capital beneficially owned as of: Ordinary shares beneficially owned as of Dec 31, 2021 Dec 31, 2021 Dec 31, 2020 Dec 31, 2019 Shareholders registered for their own account: Emasan AG, Basel, Switzerland 89135960 3.7 3.6 3.5 Novartis Foundation for Employee Participation, Basel, Switzerland 1 - <2.0 <2.0 2.1 UBS Fund Management (Switzerland) AG, Basel, Switzerland 55730682 2.3 2.3 2.1 Credit Suisse Funds AG, Zurich, Switzerland 50012984 2.1 2.0 <2.0 1 The Novartis Foundation for Employee Participation (the \"Employee Foundation\") is a special purpose entity that was founded by, but is independent from, Novartis. % of respective share capital held as of: Ordinary shares held as of Dec 31, 2021 Dec 31, 2021 Dec 31, 2020 Dec 31, 2019 Shareholders registered as nominees: Chase Nominees Ltd., London, England 213861528 8.8 9.6 10.4 The Bank of New York Mellon, New York, NY 72781460 3.0 3.4 3.8 Through The Bank of New York Mellon, Everett, MA 38915733 1.6 1.7 2.0 Through The Bank of New York Mellon, New York, NY 25990663 1.1 1.2 1.2 Through The Bank of New York Mellon, SA/NV, Brussels, Belgium 7875064 0.3 0.5 0.6 Nortrust Nominees Ltd., London, England 102224686 4.2 4.2 3.9 Shareholder acting as American Depositary Share (ADS) depositary: JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., New York, NY 269889074 11.1 11.7 12.5 According to a disclosure notification filed with Novartis AG, Norges Bank (Central Bank of Norway), Oslo, Nor - way, held 2.1% of the share capital of Novartis AG, or 50 487 229 shares, as of December 31, 2021, but was not registered in our share register as of December 31, 2021. Provided that these shares are registered in the share register on the record date of the Annual General Meet - ing, Norges Bank will have full voting rights for all of these shares. According to a disclosure notification filed with Novartis AG and the SIX Swiss Exchange, Black - Rock, Inc., New York, NY, held 5%, but was registered with less than 2% of the share capital of Novartis AG in our share register as of December 31, 2021. According to disclosure notifications filed with Novartis AG and the SIX Swiss Exchange, The Capital Group Companies, Inc., Los Angeles, California, held between 3% and 5%, but was not registered in our share Item 7. Major Shareholders and Related Party Transactions 159register as of December 31, 2019, and December 31, 2018. As of December 31, 2021, no other shareholder was registered as owner of more than 2% of the registered share capital. The Articles of Incorporation provide that no share - holder shall be registered with the right to vote shares comprising more than 2% of the registered share capi -tal. The Board of Directors may, upon request, grant an exemption from this restriction. Considerations include whether the shareholder supports the Novartis goal of creating sustainable value and has a long-term invest - ment horizon. Exemptions are in force for the registered major shareholders as described above. Novartis has not entered into any agreement with any shareholder regarding the voting or holding of Novartis shares. 7.B Related party transactions The information set forth under \"Item 18. Financial Statements\u2014Note 27. Transactions with related parties\" is incor - porated by reference. 7.C Interests of experts and counsel Not applicable.Item 8. Financial Information 160Item 8. Financial Information 8.A Consolidated statements and other financial information See \"Item 18. Financial Statements.\" Dividend policy Subject to the dividend policy described below, our Board of Directors expects to recommend the payment of a dividend in respect of each financial year. If approved by our shareholders at the relevant annual shareholders' meeting, the dividends will be payable shortly following such approval. Any shareholder who purchases our shares before the ex -dividend date and holds the shares until that date shall be deemed to be entitled to receive the dividends approved at that meeting. Dividends are reflected in our financial statements in the year in which they are approved by our shareholders. Our dividend policy is to pay a growing annual divi - dend in Swiss francs. This policy is subject to our finan - cial conditions and outlook at the time, the results of our operations, and other factors. The Board will propose a dividend of CHF 3.10 per share to the shareholders for approval at the Annual General Meeting to be held on March 4, 2022. Because we pay dividends in Swiss francs, exchange rate fluctu - ations will affect the US dollar amounts received by hold - ers of ADRs. For the amount of dividends we paid in the past three years, see \"Item 18. Financial Statements\u2014 Note 18\u2014Equity.\" Disclosure pursuant to Section 219 of the Iran Threat Reduction and Syria Human Rights Act (ITRA) At Novartis, our purpose is to reimagine medicine to improve and extend people's lives, regardless of where they live. This includes the compliant sale of medicines and other healthcare products worldwide. To help us ful - fill this mission, we have for many years maintained two representative offices located in Iran. As of October 18, 2010, a non -US affiliate within our Innovative Medicines Division entered into a non -bind - ing Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the Min - istry of Health and Medical Education of the Islamic Republic of Iran. Pursuant to the MoU, the Iranian Minis - try of Health acknowledges certain benefits that may apply to sales of certain Innovative Medicines Division medicines by third -party distributors in Iran. These include fast -track registration, market exclusivity, end-user subsidies, and exemptions from customs tar - iffs. Novartis receives no payments from the Iranian Min - istry of Health under the MoU, and the MoU creates no obligations on the part of either Novartis or the Iranian Ministry of Health. From time to time, including in 2021, non -US affiliates in our Innovative Medicines and Sandoz Divisions made payments to government entities in Iran related to pat - ents, trademarks, exit fees and other transactions ordi - narily incident to travel by doctors and other medical pro - fessionals resident in Iran to attend conferences or other events outside Iran. From time to time, including in 2021, non -US affiliates in our Innovative Medicines and Sandoz Divisions enter into agreements with hospitals, research institutes, med - ical associations and universities in Iran to provide grants and sponsor congresses, seminars and symposia, and with doctors and other healthcare professionals for con - sulting services, including participation in advisory boards and investigator services for observational (non -interventional) studies. Some hospitals and research institutes are owned or controlled by the gov - ernment of Iran, and some doctors and healthcare pro - fessionals are employed by hospitals that may be public or government -owned. Because our Innovative Medicines and Sandoz Divi - sions have operations in Iran, including employees, they obtain services and have other dealings incidental to their activities in that country, including paying taxes and salaries either directly or indirectly through a service pro - vider, and obtaining office rentals, insurance, electricity, water and telecommunications services, office and sim - ilar supplies, and customs -related services from Iranian companies that may be owned or controlled by the gov - ernment of Iran. In addition, from time to time, represen - tatives of our non-US affiliates participate in meetings with Iranian officials to discuss issues relevant to our business and the pharmaceutical industry. Non-US affiliates in our Innovative Medicines and Sandoz Divisions maintain local accounts at banks that are, as of November 5, 2018, on the Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons List (SDN List). These non-US affiliates make local transactions for employee payroll and local vendor payment purposes. These trans - actions are conducted for the purpose of facilitating the provision of medicine to Iran, in line with the humanitar - ian exceptions contained in Section 11 of Executive Order 13902 and other applicable sanctions legal authorities. No transactions are made with an Iranian financial insti - tution designated on the SDN List in connection with Iran's support for international terrorism or proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. Item 8. Financial Information 1618.B Significant changes None.Item 9. The Offer and Listing 162Item 9. The Offer and Listing 9.A Offer and listing details Our shares are listed in Switzerland on the SIX Swiss Exchange (SIX). ADSs, each representing one share, have been avail - able in the US through an ADR program since Decem - ber 1996. This program was established pursuant to a deposit agreement that we entered into with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as depositary (\"Deposit Agreement\"). Our ADRs have been listed on the NYSE since May 2000 and are traded under the symbol NVS. The depositary has informed us that as of January 26, 2022, there were 273 million ADRs outstanding, each representing one Novartis share (approximately 11% of total Novartis shares issued). On January 26, 2022, the closing price was CHF 78.16 per share on the SIX, and USD 84.24 per ADR on the NYSE. 9.B Plan of distribution Not applicable. 9.C Markets See \"\u2014Item 9.A Offer and listing details.\" 9.D Selling shareholders Not applicable. 9.E Dilution Not applicable. 9.F Expenses of the issue Not applicable.Item 10. Additional Information 163Item 10. Additional Information 10.A Share capital Not applicable. 10.B Memorandum and articles of association The following is a non-exhaustive summary of certain provisions of our Articles of Incorporation (\"Articles\"); our Regulations of the Board, the Board Committees and the Executive Committee (\"Board Regulations\"); and Swiss law, particularly the Swiss Code of Obligations (\"Swiss CO\"), and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Articles and the Board Regulations, which are an exhibit to this Form 20 -F, and to Swiss law. 10.B.1 Company purpose Novartis AG is registered in the commercial register of the canton of Basel -Stadt, Switzerland, under number CHE -103.867.266. Our business purpose, as stated in Article 2 of the Articles, is to hold interests in enterprises in the area of healthcare or nutrition. We may also hold interests in enterprises in the areas of biology, chemis - try, physics, information technology or related areas. We may acquire, mortgage, liquidate or sell real estate and intellectual property rights in Switzerland or abroad. In pursuing our business purpose, we strive to create sus - tainable value. 10.B.2 Directors According to our Articles, the Board of Directors (\"Board\") consists of a minimum of eight and a maximum of 16 members. The members of the Board (including the Chairman) are elected individually by the General Meet - ing of Shareholders (\"General Meeting\") for a one-year term of office lasting until completion of the next Annual General Meeting of Shareholders (\"AGM\"). (a) A Board resolution requires the affirmative majority of the votes cast. According to our Board Regulations, a member of our Board (\"Director\") may not partici - pate in decisions and resolutions on matters that affect, or reasonably might affect, the Director's inter - ests or the interests of a person close to the Direc - tor. (b) Compensation of the Directors is subject to the approval of the aggregate amounts of such compen - sation by a shareholders' resolution under the Ordi - nance against Excessive Compensation in Public Companies of the Swiss Federal Council. (c) The Articles prohibit the granting of loans or credits to Directors.(d) The Articles provide that a Director shall not serve on the Board for more than 12 years. The Board may, under certain circumstances and if deemed in the best interests of the Company, recommend excep - tions to this rule to the General Meeting. (e) Our Directors are not required to be shareholders at the time of the election by the General Meeting. How - ever, according to our share ownership guidelines, the Chairman is required to own a minimum of 30 000 Novartis AG shares, and other Directors are required to own at least 5 000 Novartis AG shares within five years after joining the Board, to ensure their interests are aligned with those of our shareholders. 10.B.3 Shareholder rights Because Novartis AG has only one class of registered shares, the following information applies to all sharehold - ers. (a) Under the Swiss CO, we may only pay dividends out of balance sheet profits or out of distributable reserves. In any event, under the Swiss CO, while the Board may propose that a dividend be paid, we may only pay dividends upon shareholders' approval at a General Meeting. Furthermore, the Swiss CO requires us to accrue general legal reserves under certain cir - cumstances so long as these reserves amount to less than 20% of our registered share capital, and Swiss law and the Articles permit us to accrue additional reserves beyond the statutory reserves. Our auditors must confirm that the dividend proposal of our Board conforms with the Swiss CO and the Articles. Our Board expects to recommend the payment of a divi - dend in respect of each financial year. See \"Item 6. Directors, Senior Management and Employees\u2014Item 6.C Board - dated statements and other financial information\u2014 Dividend policy.\" Dividends are usually due and payable shortly after the shareholders have passed a resolution approving the payment. Dividends that have not been claimed within five years after the due date revert to us and are allocated to our general reserves. For information about deduction of the withholding tax or other duties from dividend payments, see \"\u2014Item 10.E Taxation.\"Item 10. Additional Information 164(b) Each share is entitled to one vote at a General Meet - ing. Voting rights may only be exercised for shares registered with the right to vote on the record date for the applicable General Meeting. In order to do so, the shareholder must file a share registration form with us, setting forth the shareholder's name, address and citizenship (or, in the case of a legal entity, its reg - istered office). If the shareholder has not timely reg - istered its shares, then the shareholder may not vote at, or participate in, a General Meeting. To vote its shares, the shareholder must also explicitly declare that it has acquired the shares in its own name and for its own account. If the shareholder refuses to make such a declaration, the shares may not be voted unless the Board recognizes such share - holder as a nominee. The Articles provide that no shareholder shall be registered with the right to vote shares comprising more than 2% of the registered share capital. The Board may, upon request, grant an exemption from this restriction. Considerations include whether the shareholder supports our goal of creating sustainable value and has a long -term investment horizon. Fur - thermore, the Articles provide that no nominee shall be registered with the right to vote shares compris - ing more than 0.5% of the registered share capital. The Board may, upon request, grant an exemption from this restriction if the nominee discloses the names, addresses, and number of shares of the per - sons for whose account it holds 0.5% or more of the registered share capital. The same restrictions indi - rectly apply to ADR holders. We have in the past granted exemptions from the 2% rule for sharehold - ers and the 0.5% rule for nominees. For purposes of the 2% rule for shareholders and the 0.5% rule for nominees, groups of companies and groups of shareholders acting in concert are consid - ered to be one shareholder. These rules also apply to shares acquired or subscribed by the exercise of sub - scription, option or conversion rights. After hearing the registered shareholder or nom - inee, the Board may cancel, with retroactive effect as of the date of registration, the registration of the shareholders if the registration was effected based on false information. Registration restrictions in the Articles may only be removed upon a resolution carrying a two -thirds majority of the votes represented at a General Meet - ing. Except as noted below, shareholders' resolutions require the approval of an absolute majority of the votes present at a General Meeting. As a result, abstentions have the effect of votes against such res - olutions. Some examples of shareholders' resolutions requiring a vote by such \"absolute majority of the votes\" are: Adoption and amendment of the Articles Election and removal of the Chairman, the Board and Compensation Committee members, the Inde - pendent Proxy and the external auditor Approval of the management report and of the con - solidated financial statements Approval of the financial statements of Novartis AG, and decision on the appropriation of available earn - ings shown on the balance sheet, including divi - dends, if any Approval of the maximum aggregate compensation of the Board (from an AGM until the next AGM) and of the Executive Committee (for the financial year following the AGM) Discharge of Board and Executive Committee members from liability for matters disclosed to the General Meeting Decision on other matters that are reserved by law or by the Articles (e.g., advisory vote on the Com - pensation Report) to the General Meeting According to the Articles and Swiss law, the fol - lowing matters require the approval of a \"superma - jority\" of at least two -thirds of the votes present at a General Meeting: Alteration of the purpose of Novartis AG Creation of shares with increased voting powers Implementation of restrictions on the transfer of registe red shares, and the removal of such restric - tions Authorized or conditional increase of the share cap - ital Increase of the share capital out of equity, by con - tribution in kind, for the purpose of an acquisition of property or the grant of special rights Restriction or cancellation of subscription rights Change of the registered office of Novartis AG Dissolution of Novartis AG In addition, the law provides for a qualified major - ity for other resolutions, such as a merger or demerger. Our shareholders are required to annually elect all Directors (including the Chairman), the Compen - sation Committee members, the external auditor and the Independent Proxy. The Articles do not provide for cumulative voting of shares. At a General Meeting, shareholders can be repre - sented by a proxy, which must either be the sharehold - er's legal representative, another shareholder with the right to vote, or the Independent Proxy. Votes are taken either by a show of hands or by electronic voting, unless the General Meeting resolves to have a ballot or where a ballot is ordered by the chair of the meeting. How - ever, in accordance with Swiss legislation passed in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, in December 2021 the Board has decided that voting rights at our 2022 AGM can only be exercised through the Inde - pendent Proxy. It will not be possible to physically attend our 2022 AGM.Item 10. Additional Information 165ADSs, each representing one Novartis AG share and evidenced by ADRs, are issued by our depositary JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., New York, and not by us. The ADR is vested with rights defined and enu - merated in the Deposit Agreement (such as the rights to vote, to receive a dividend and to receive a share of Novartis AG in exchange for a certain number of ADRs). The enumeration of rights, including any lim - itations on those rights in the Deposit Agreement, is final. There are no other rights given to the ADR hold - ers. Only the ADS depositary, holding our shares underlying the ADRs, is registered as shareholder in our share register. An ADR is not a Novartis AG share and an ADR holder is not a Novartis AG shareholder. The Deposit Agreement between our depositary, the ADR holder and us has granted certain indirect rights to vote to the ADR holders. ADR holders may not attend a General Meeting in person. ADR holders exercise their voting rights by instructing JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., our depositary, to exercise the vot - ing rights attached to the registered shares underly-ing the ADRs. Each ADR represents one Novartis AG share. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., exercises the vot - ing rights for registered shares underlying ADRs for which no voting instructions have been given by pro - viding a discretionary proxy to an uninstructed inde - pendent designee. Such designee has to be a share - holder of Novartis AG. The same voting restrictions apply to ADR holders as to those holding Novartis AG shares (i.e., the right to vote up to 2% of the Novartis AG registered share capital - unless otherwise granted an exemption by the Board - and the disclo - sure requirement for nominees). (c) Shareholders have the right to allocate the profit shown on our balance sheet and to distribute divi - dends by vote taken at the General Meeting, subject to the legal requirements described in \"Item 10.B.3(a) Shareholder rights.\" (d) Under the Swiss CO, any surplus arising out of a liq - uidation of Novartis AG (i.e., after the settlement of all claims of all creditors) would be distributed to the shareholders in proportion to the paid -in nominal value of their shares. (e) The Swiss CO limits a corporation's ability to hold or repurchase its own shares. We and our subsidiaries may only repurchase shares if we have sufficient freely disposable equity in the amount of the pur - chase price of the acquired shares. The aggregate nominal value of all Novartis AG shares held by us and our subsidiaries may not exceed 10% of our regis - tered share capital. However, it is accepted that a Swiss corporation may repurchase its own shares beyond the statutory limit of 10% if the repurchased shares are clearly earmarked for cancellation. In addi - tion, we are required to recognize a negative position, or if our subsidiaries acquire our shares, to create a special reserve on our balance sheet in the amount of the purchase price of the acquired shares. Repur - chased shares held by us or our subsidiaries do not carry any rights to vote at a General Meeting, but are entitled to the economic benefits generally con - nected with the shares. The definition of subsidiaries, and therefore, treasury shares, for purposes of the above-described reserves requirement and voting restrictions, differs from the definition of subsidiaries for purposes of consolidation in our consolidated financial statements. The definition in the consoli - dated financial statements requires consolidation for financial reporting purposes of special purpose enti - ties in instances where we have the power to govern the financial and operating policies of the entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities. Therefore, our consolidated financial statements include special purpose entities, mainly foundations, which do not qualify as subsidiaries subject to the reserve require - ments and voting restrictions of the Swiss CO because we do not hold a majority participation in these spe - cial purpose entities. Accordingly, no reserve require - ments apply to shares held by such special purpose entities, and such entities are not restricted from inde - pendently voting their shares. Under the Swiss CO, we may not cancel treasury shares without the approval of a capital reduction by our shareholders. (f) Not applicable. (g) Since all of our issued and outstanding shares have been fully paid in, our shareholders are not obliged to make further contributions with respect to their shares. (h) See \"\u2014Item 10.B.3(b) Shareholder rights\" and \"\u2014 Item 10.B.7 Change in control.\" 10.B.4 Changes to shareholder rights Under the Swiss CO, we may not issue new shares with - out the prior approval of a capital increase by our share - holders. If a capital increase is approved, then our share - holders would generally have certain pre-emptive rights to obtain newly issued shares in an amount proportional to the nominal value of the shares they already hold. These pre-emptive rights could be excluded in certain limited circumstances with the approval of a resolution adopted at a General Meeting by a supermajority of two-thirds of the votes. In addition, we may not create shares with increased voting powers or place restrictions on the transfer of registered shares without the approval of a resolution adopted at a General Meeting by a super - majority of votes. In addition, see \"\u2014Item 10.B.3(b) Share - holder rights\" with regard to the Board's ability to cancel the registration of shares under limited circumstances. 10.B.5 Shareholder meetings Under the Swiss CO and the Articles, we must hold an AGM within six months after the end of our financial year. A General Meeting may be convened by the Board or, if necessary, by the external auditor. The Board is further required to convene an extraordinary General Meeting if so resolved by a General Meeting, or if so requested by shareholders representing at least 10% of the share capital, specifying the items for the agenda and their proposals. Shareholders representing shares with an aggregate nominal value of at least CHF 1 000 000 may request that an item be included in a General Meeting agenda. A General Meeting is convened by publishing a notice in the Swiss Official Gazette of Commerce Item 10. Additional Information 166 (Schweizerisches Handelsamtsblatt) at least 20 days prior to such meeting. Shareholders may also be informed by mail. Neither the Swiss CO nor the Articles require a quorum for a General Meeting. In addition, see \"\u2014 Item 10.B.3(b) Shareholder rights\" regarding conditions for exercising a shareholder's right to vote at a General Meeting. 10.B.6 Limitations There are no limitations under the Swiss CO or our Arti - cles on the right of non -Swiss residents or nationals to own or vote shares other than the restrictions applica - ble to all shareholders. But see \"\u2014Item 10.B.3(b) Share - holder rights\" regarding conditions for exercising an ADR holder's right to vote at a shareholder meeting. 10.B.7 Change in control The Articles and the Board Regulations contain no pro - vision that would have an effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control of Novartis AG and that would operate only with respect to a merger, acquisition or corporate restructuring involving us or any of our sub - sidiaries. According to the Swiss Merger Act, shareholders may pass a resolution to merge with another corpora - tion at any time. Such a resolution would require the con - sent of at least two -thirds of all votes present at the nec - essary General Meeting. Under the Swiss Financial Market Infrastructure Act, shareholders and groups of shareholders acting in con - cert who acquire more than 33 1/3% of our shares would be under an obligation to make an offer to acquire all remaining Novartis AG shares. Novartis AG has neither opted out from the mandatory takeover offer obligation nor opted to increase the threshold for mandatory take - over offers in its Articles.10.B.8 Disclosure of shareholdings Under the Swiss Financial Market Infrastructure Act, per - sons who directly, indirectly or in concert with other par - ties acquire or dispose of our shares or purchase or sale rights relating to our shares are required to notify us and the SIX of the level of their holdings whenever such hold - ings reach, exceed or fall below certain and 66 2/3% - of the voting rights represented by our share capital (whether exercisable or not). This also applies to anyone who has discretionary power to exercise voting rights associated with our shares. Following receipt of such notification, we are required to inform the public by pub - lishing the information via the electronic publication plat - form operated by the SIX. An additional disclosure obligation exists under the Swiss CO that requires us to disclose, once a year in the notes to the financial statements published in our Annual Report, the identity of all of our shareholders (or related groups of shareholders) who have been granted exemp - tion entitling them to vote more than 2% of our registered share capital, as described in \"\u2014Item 10.B.3(b) Share - holder rights.\" 10.B.9 Differences in the law See the references to Swiss law throughout this \"\u2014 Item 10.B Memorandum and articles of association.\" 10.B.10 Changes in capital The requirements of the Articles regarding changes in capital are not more stringent than the requirements of Swiss law. 10.C Material contracts Acquisition of The Medicines Company On November 23, 2019, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the \"Merger Agreement\") with US-based pharmaceutical company The Medicines Company. Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, on Decem - ber 5, 2019, Novartis, through a subsidiary, commenced a tender offer to acquire all outstanding shares of The Medicines Company for USD 85 per share, or a total con - sideration of approximately USD 9.6 billion in cash on a fully diluted basis. The tender offer expired on January 3, 2020, and on January 6, 2020, the acquiring subsid - iary merged with and into The Medicines Company, resulting in The Medicines Company becoming an indi -rect wholly owned subsidiary of Novartis. This merger broadens our cardiovascular portfolio by adding incli - siran, an investigational cholesterol-lowering therapy. Divestment of Roche shares On November 3, 2021, we entered into a Share Repur - chase Agreement with Roche under which we agreed to sell 53.3 million (approximately 33%) of Roche bearer shares in a bilateral transaction to Roche for a total con - sideration of USD 20.7 billion. The transaction was approved by the shareholders of Roche on Novem - ber 26, 2021, and closed on December 6, 2021.Item 10. Additional Information 16710.D Exchange controls There are no Swiss governmental laws, decrees or reg - ulations that affect - in a manner material to Novartis AG - the export or import of capital, including the availabil - ity of cash and cash equivalents for use by Novartis or any foreign exchange controls that affect the remittance of dividends, interest or other payments to non -residents or non -citizens of Switzerland who hold Novartis AG securities. 10.E Taxation The taxation discussion set forth below is intended only as a descriptive summary and does not purport to be a complete analysis or listing of all potential tax effects rel - evant to the ownership or disposition of our shares or ADRs. The statements of US and Swiss tax laws set forth below are based on the laws and regulations in force as of the date of this 20 -F - including the current Conven - tion Between the US and the Swiss Confederation for the Avoidance of Double Taxation with Respect to Taxes on Income, entered into force on December 19, 1997 (\"the Treaty\"); the US Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as (\"the Code\"); Treasury regulations; rulings; judi - cial decisions; and administrative pronouncements - and may be subject to any changes in US and Swiss law, and in any double taxation convention or treaty between the US and Switzerland occurring after that date, which changes may have retroactive effect. Swiss taxation Swiss residents Withholding Tax on dividends and distributions. Divi - dends that we pay and similar cash or in -kind distribu - tions that we may make to a holder of shares or ADRs (including distributions of liquidation proceeds in excess of the nominal value, stock dividends and, under certain circumstances, proceeds from repurchases of shares by us in excess of the nominal value) are generally sub - ject to a Swiss federal withholding tax (\"the Withholding Tax\") at a current rate of 35%. Under certain circum - stances, distributions out of capital contribution reserves made by shareholders after December 31, 1996, are exempt from the Withholding Tax. We are required to withhold Withholding Tax due from the gross distribution and to pay the Withholding Tax to the Swiss Federal Tax Administration. The Withholding Tax is refundable in full to Swiss tax residents who are the beneficial owners of the taxable distribution at the time it is resolved and duly report the gross distribution received on their personal tax return or in their financial statements for tax pur - poses, as the case may be. Income tax on dividends. A Swiss tax resident who receives dividends and similar distributions (including stock dividends and liquidation surplus) on shares or ADRs is required to include such amounts in the share - holder's personal income tax return. However, distribu -tions out of qualified capital contribution reserves are not subject to income tax. A corporate shareholder may claim substantial relief from taxation of dividends and similar distributions received if the shares held represent a fair market value of at least CHF 1 million. Capital gains tax upon disposal of shares. Under current Swiss tax law, the gain realized on shares held by a Swiss resident who holds shares or ADRs as part of his private property is generally not subject to any federal, cantonal or municipal income taxation on gains realized on the sale or other disposal of shares or ADRs. However, gains realized upon a repurchase of shares by us may be char - acterized as taxable dividend income if certain condi - tions are met. Book gains realized on shares or ADRs held by a Swiss corporate entity or by a Swiss resident individual as part of the shareholder's business property are, in general, included in the taxable income of such person. However, the Federal Law on the Direct Federal Tax of December 14, 1990, and several cantonal laws on direct cantonal taxes provide for exceptions for Swiss corporate entities holding more than 10% of our voting stock for more than one year. Residents of other countries Recipients of dividends and similar distributions on our shares who are neither residents of Switzerland for tax purposes nor holding shares as part of a business con - ducted through a permanent establishment situated in Switzerland (\"Non -Resident Holders\") are not subject to Swiss income taxes in respect of such distributions. Moreover, gains realized by such recipients upon the dis - posal of shares are not subject to Swiss income taxes. Non-Resident Holders of shares are, however, sub - ject to the Withholding Tax on dividends and similar dis - tributions mentioned above and, under certain circum - stances, to the Stamp Duty described below. Such Non-Resident Holders may be entitled to a partial refund of the Withholding Tax if the country in which they reside has entered into a bilateral treaty for the avoidance of double taxation with Switzerland. Non -Resident Holders should be aware that the procedures for claiming treaty refunds (and the time frame required for obtaining a refund) may differ from country to country. Non -Resident Holders should consult their own tax advisors regarding receipt, ownership, purchase, sale or other dispositions of shares or ADRs, and the procedures for claiming a refund of the Withholding Tax.Item 10. Additional Information 168As of January 1, 2022, Switzerland has entered into bilateral treaties for the avoidance of double taxation with respect to income taxes with the following countries, whereby a part of the above -mentioned Withholding Tax may be refunded (subject to the limitations set forth in such treaties): Albania Algeria ArgentinaArmeniaAustralia Austria AzerbaijanBahrainBangladeshBelarus Belgium BrazilBulgariaCanada Chile ChinaColombiaCroatiaCyprusCzech Republic Denmark EcuadorEgyptEstoniaFinlandFrance Georgia GermanyGhanaGreece Hong Kong HungaryIcelandIndiaIndonesia Iran Republic of IrelandIsraelItaly Ivory Coast of Korea(South Korea) Kosovo KuwaitKyrgyzstanLatviaLiechtensteinLithuania Republic Slovenia South AfricaSpainSri Lanka Sweden TaiwanTajikistanThailandTrinidad and Tobago Tunisia TurkeyTurkmenistanUkraine United Arab Emirates United KingdomUnited States of AmericaUruguayUzbekistanVenezuela Vietnam Zambia Tax treaty negotiations are underway, or have been conducted, with Bosnia and Herzegovina, Cameroon, Costa Rica, Ethiopia, Kenya, Libya, Nigeria, Rwanda, Senegal, Syria and Zimbabwe. Tax treaty negotiations between Swit - zerland and some of the countries listed in the immediately preceding sentence have been ongoing for an extended period of time, and we are not certain when or if such negotiations will be completed, and when or if the corre - sponding treaties will come into effect. A Non -Resident Holder of shares or ADRs will not be lia - ble for any Swiss taxes other than the Withholding Tax described above and, if the transfer occurs through or with a Swiss bank or other Swiss securities dealer, the Stamp Duty described below. If, however, the shares or ADRs of Non -Resident Holders can be attributed to a permanent establishment or a fixed place of business maintained by such person within Switzerland during the relevant tax year, the shares or ADRs may be subject to Swiss income taxes in respect of income and gains real - ized on the shares or ADRs, and such person may qual - ify for a full refund of the Withholding Tax based on Swiss tax law. Residents of the US. A Non -Resident Holder who is a resident of the US for purposes of the Treaty is eligible for a reduced rate of tax on dividends equal to 15% of the dividend, provided that such holder (i) qualifies for benefits under the Treaty, (ii) is not a company (or, if it is a company, such company directly holds less than 10% of our voting stock), and (iii) does not conduct business through a permanent establishment or fixed base in Swit - zerland to which the shares or ADRs are attributable. Such an eligible holder must apply for a refund of the amount of the Withholding Tax in excess of the 15% Treaty rate. A Non -Resident Holder who is a resident of the US for purposes of the Treaty is eligible for a reduced rate of tax on dividends equal to 5% of the dividend, pro - vided that such holder (i) is a company, (ii) qualifies for benefits under the Treaty, (iii) holds directly at least 10% of our voting stock, and (iv) does not conduct business through a permanent establishment or fixed place of business in Switzerland to which the shares or ADRs are attributable. Such an eligible holder must apply for a refund of the amount of the Withholding Tax in excess of the 5% Treaty rate. Claims for refunds must be filed on Swiss Tax Form 82 (82C for corporations; 82I for indi - viduals; 82E for other entities), which may be obtained from any Swiss Consulate General in the US or from the Federal Tax Administration of Switzerland at the address below, together with an instruction form. Four copies of the form must be duly completed, signed before a notary public of the US, and sent to the Federal Tax Adminis - tration of Switzerland, Eigerstrasse 65, CH -3003 Bern, Switzerland. The form must be accompanied by suitable evidence of deduction of Swiss tax withheld at source, such as certificates of deduction, signed bank vouchers or credit slips. The form may be filed on or after July 1 or January 1 following the date the dividend was payable, but no later than December 31 of the third year following the calendar year in which the dividend became payable. For US resident holders of ADRs, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as depositary, will comply with these Swiss proce -Item 10. Additional Information 169dures on behalf of the holders, and will remit the net amount to the holders. Stamp Duty upon transfer of securities. The sale of shares, whether by Swiss residents or Non -Resident Holders, may be subject to federal securities transfer Stamp Duty of 0.15%, calculated on the sale proceeds, if the sale occurs through or with a Swiss bank or other Swiss securities dealer, as defined in the Swiss Federal Stamp Duty Act. The Stamp Duty has to be paid by the securities dealer and may be charged to the parties in a taxable transaction who are not securities dealers. Stamp Duty may also be due if a sale of shares occurs with or through a non -Swiss bank or securities dealer, provided that (i) such bank or dealer is a member of the SIX, and (ii) the sale takes place on the SIX. In addition to this Stamp Duty, the sale of shares by or through a member of the SIX may be subject to a minor stock exchange levy. US federal income taxation The following is a general discussion of the material US federal income tax consequences of the ownership and disposition of our shares or ADRs that may be relevant to you if you are a US Holder (as defined below). Because this discussion does not consider any specific circum - stances of any particular holder of our shares or ADRs, persons who are subject to US taxation are strongly urged to consult their own tax advisors as to the overall US federal, state and local tax consequences, as well as to the overall Swiss and other foreign tax consequences, of the ownership and disposition of our shares or ADRs. In particular, additional or different rules may apply to US expatriates; banks and other financial institutions; regu - lated investment companies; traders in securities who elect to apply a mark -to-market method of accounting; dealers in securities or currencies; tax -exempt entities; insurance companies; broker -dealers; investors liable for alternative minimum tax; investors that hold shares or ADRs as part of a straddle, hedging or conversion trans - action; holders whose functional currency is not the US dollar; partnerships or other pass-through entities; per - sons who acquired our shares pursuant to the exercise of employee stock options or otherwise as compensa - tion; and persons who hold, directly, indirectly or by attri - bution, 10% or more of our outstanding shares. This dis - cussion generally applies only to US Holders who hold the shares or ADRs as a capital asset (generally, for investment purposes), and whose functional currency is the US dollar. Investors are urged to consult their own tax advisors concerning whether they are eligible for benefits under the Treaty. For purposes of this discussion, a US Holder is a ben - eficial owner of our shares or ADRs who is (i) an individ - ual who is a citizen or resident of the US for US federal income tax purposes; (ii) a corporation (or other entity taxable as a corporation for US federal income tax pur - poses) created or organized in or under the laws of the US or a state thereof or the District of Columbia; (iii) an estate the income of which is subject to US federal income taxation regardless of its source; or (iv) a trust (i) subject to the primary supervision of a US court and the control of one or more US persons, or (ii) that has a valid election in place to be treated as a US person. If a partnership (or other entity treated as a partnership for US federal income tax purposes) holds shares or ADRs, the tax treatment of a partner generally will depend upon the status of the partner and the activities of the part - nership. Partners in a partnership that holds shares or ADRs are urged to consult their own tax advisor regard - ing the specific tax consequences of the owning and disposing of such shares or ADRs by the partnership. For US federal income tax purposes, a US Holder of ADRs generally will be treated as the beneficial owner of our shares represented by the ADRs. However, see the discussion below under \"\u2014Dividends\" regarding cer - tain statements made by the US Treasury concerning depositary arrangements. This discussion assumes that each obligation in the Deposit Agreement and any related agreement will be performed in accordance with its terms. Dividends. US Holders will be required to include in gross income, as an item of ordinary income, the full amount (without reduction for any Withholding Tax) of the divi - dend paid with respect to our shares or ADRs at the time that such dividend is received by the US Holder, in the case of shares, or by the depositary, in the case of ADRs. For this purpose, a \"dividend\" will include any distribu - tion paid by us with respect to our shares or ADRs (other than certain pro rata distributions of our capital stock) paid out of our current or accumulated earnings and prof - its, as determined under US federal income tax princi - ples. To the extent the amount of a distribution by us exceeds our current and accumulated earnings and prof - its, such excess will first be treated as a tax -free return of capital to the extent of a US Holder's tax basis in the shares or ADRs (with a corresponding reduction in such tax basis), and thereafter will be treated as capital gain, which will be long -term capital gain if the US Holder held our shares or ADRs for more than one year. Under the Code, dividend payments by us on the shares or ADRs are not eligible for the dividends received deduction gen - erally allowed to corporate shareholders. Dividend income in respect of our shares or ADRs will constitute income from sources outside the US for US foreign tax credit purposes. Subject to the limitations and conditions provided in the Code, US Holders gener - ally may claim as a credit against their US federal income tax liability, any Withholding Tax withheld from a dividend. The rules governing the foreign tax credit are complex. Each US Holder is urged to consult its own tax advisor concerning whether, and to what extent, a foreign tax credit will be available with respect to dividends received from us. Alternatively, a US Holder may claim the With - holding Tax as a deduction for the taxable year within which the Withholding Tax is paid or accrued, provided a deduction is claimed for all of the foreign income taxes the US Holder pays or accrues in the particular year. A deduction does not reduce US tax on a dollar -for-dollar basis like a tax credit. The deduction, however, is not subject to the limitations applicable to foreign tax cred - its, but may be subject to other limitations, and each US Holder is urged to consult its own tax advisor. The US Treasury has expressed concern that parties to whom ADRs are released may be taking actions incon -Item 10. Additional Information 170sistent with the claiming of foreign tax credits for US Holders of ADRs. Accordingly, the summary above of the creditability of the Withholding Tax could be affected by future actions that may be taken by the US Treasury. In general, a US Holder will be required to determine the amount of any dividend paid in Swiss francs, includ - ing the amount of any Withholding Tax imposed thereon, by translating the Swiss francs into US dollars at the spot rate on the date the dividend is actually or constructively received by a US Holder, in the case of shares, or by the depositary, in the case of ADRs, regardless of whether the Swiss francs are in fact converted into US dollars. If a US Holder converts the Swiss francs so received into US dollars on the date of receipt, the US Holder gener - ally should not recognize foreign currency gain or loss on such conversion. If a US Holder does not convert the Swiss francs so received into US dollars on the date of receipt, the US Holder will have a tax basis in the Swiss francs equal to the US dollar value on such date. Any for - eign currency gain or loss that a US Holder recognizes on a subsequent conversion or other disposition of the Swiss francs generally will be treated as US source ordi - nary income or loss. For a non -corporate US Holder, the US dollar amount of any dividends paid that constitute qualified dividend income generally will be taxable at a maximum rate of 15% (or 20% in the case of taxpayers with annual income that exceeds certain thresholds), provided that the US Holder meets certain holding period and other require - ments. In addition, the dividends could be subject to a 3.8% net investment income tax. This tax is applied against the lesser of the US Holder's net investment income or the amount by which modified adjusted gross income exceeds a statutory threshold amount based on filing status. We currently believe that dividends paid with respect to our shares and ADRs will constitute qualified dividend income for US federal income tax purposes, provided that the US Holder meets certain holding period and other requirements. US Holders of shares or ADRs are urged to consult their own tax advisors regarding the availability to them of the reduced dividend rate in light of their own particular situation and the computations of their foreign tax credit limitation with respect to any qual - ified dividends paid to them, as applicable. Sale or other taxable disposition. Upon a sale or other taxable disposition of shares or ADRs, US Holders gen -erally will recognize capital gain or loss in an amount equal to the difference between the US dollar value of the amount realized on the disposition and the US Hold - er's tax basis (determined in US dollars) in the shares or ADRs. This capital gain or loss generally will be US source gain or loss and will be treated as long -term cap - ital gain or loss if the holding period in the shares or ADRs exceeds one year. In the case of a non -corporate US Holder, any long-term capital gain generally will be sub - ject to US federal income tax at preferential rates, with a maximum rate of 15% (or 20% in the case of taxpayers with annual income that exceeds certain thresholds). In addition, the gains could be subject to a 3.8% investment income tax. This tax is applied against the lesser of the US Holder's net investment income or the amount by which modified adjusted gross income exceeds a stat - utory threshold amount based on filing status. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to significant lim - itations under the Code. Deposits or withdrawals of our shares by US Holders in exchanges for ADRs will not result in the realization of gain or loss for US federal income tax purposes. US information reporting and backup withholding. Divi - dend payments with respect to shares or ADRs and pro - ceeds from the sale, exchange or other disposition of shares or ADRs received in the United States or through US-related financial intermediaries may be subject to information reporting to the US Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and possible US backup withholding. Certain exempt recipients (such as corporations) are not subject to these information reporting and backup withholding requirements. Backup withholding will not apply to a US Holder who furnishes a correct taxpayer identification number and makes any other required certification or who is otherwise exempt from backup withholding. Any US Holders required to establish their exempt status generally must provide a properly executed IRS Form W -9 (Request for Taxpayer Identification Number and Certi - fication). Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Amounts withheld as backup withholding may be cred - ited against a US Holder's US federal income tax liabil - ity, and a US Holder may obtain a refund of any excess amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules by timely filing the appropriate claim for refund with the IRS and furnishing any required information. 10.F Dividends and paying agents Not applicable. 10.G Statement by experts Not applicable.Item 10.

This annual contribution payment will equal: (a)(1) USD 1.7 million less (a)(2) the custody costs, fees and expenses (including, without limitation, any central securities depository fees, charges and expenses) incurred during the applicable Contract Year (the items in (a)(2) collec - tively are the \"Custody Costs\") plus (b) 70% of the gross issuance and cancellation fees collected by JPMorgan under the Deposit Agreement during such Contract Year minus (c) that portion (if any) of JPMorgan's legal fees, charges and out-of-pocket expenses in excess of USD 50 000 for such Contract Year.

Controls and Procedures Report of Novartis Management on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Novartis AG's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Finan cial Officer, after evaluating the effectiveness of our dis closure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a15(e)) as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report, have concluded that, as of such date, our disclosure controls and procedures were effec tive. The Board of Directors and management of the Group are responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. The Group's internal control system was designed to provide reasonable assurance to the Group's management and Board of Directors regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation and fair presentation of its published consolidated financial statements. All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective may not pre vent or detect misstatements and can provide only rea sonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compli ance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.Group management assessed the effectiveness of the Group's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021. In making this assessment, it used the criteria established in Internal Control\u2014Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsor ing Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based on our assessment, management concluded that, as of December 31, 2021, the Group's internal control over financial reporting is effective based on those cri teria. PricewaterhouseCoopers AG, Switzerland, an inde pendent registered public accounting firm, has issued an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Group's internal control over financial reporting, which is included in this Annual Report under \"Item 18. Financial State ments\u2014Report of independent registered public accounting firm.\" See the report of PwC, an independent registered public accounting firm, included under \"Item 18. Finan cial Statements\u2014Report of independent registered pub lic accounting firm.\" There were no changes to our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the period cov ered by this Annual Report that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Change in Registrant's Certifying Accountant 183Item 16F . Change in Registrant's Certifying Accountant On behalf of the Board, the ACC selects and nominates an independent external auditor for election at the AGM by our shareholders, who must elect the external audi tor on an annual basis via shareholder resolutions that require the approval of an absolute majority of the votes present at the AGM. In April 2020, the ACC decided to invite several audit firms, including PwC, to participate in a tender process that would lead to the selection of an external auditor to be proposed for election at the 2022 AGM. The audit tender was conducted through a fair, transparent and balanced process according to defined selection criteria under a strong governance structure, ensuring that all audit firms had equal access to man agement and information. Based on the results of this tendering process, the Board decided to propose to the shareholders at the 2022 AGM the election of KPMG AG (\"KPMG\") as the external auditor commencing for the 2022 fiscal year. As disclosed in our Form 20 F for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020, we notified PwC that they would not be proposed for re election as exter nal auditor at the AGM on March 4, 2022. If KPMG is elected as our new external auditor at the 2022 AGM, KPMG would then serve as our external auditor for the 2022 fiscal year. In respect of fiscal years 2020 and 2021 and the sub sequent interim period through February 1, 2022: PwC has not issued any reports on our consolidated financial statements or on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting that contained an adverse opinion or a disclaimer of opinion. The rel evant PwC auditor's reports were not qualified or mod ified as to uncertainty, audit scope or accounting prin ciples. There has not been any disagreement with PwC on any matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure, or auditing scope or procedures which disagreement, if not resolved to PwC's satisfac tion, would have caused PwC to make reference to the subject matter of the disagreement in connection with its auditor's reports, or any reportable event as described in Item 16F(a)(1)(v) of Form 20 F. We have provided PwC with a copy of the foregoing dis closure and have requested that the firm furnish us with a letter addressed to the US Securities and Exchange Commission stating whether PwC agrees with such dis closure and, if not, stating the respects in which it does not agree. A copy of PwC's letter, dated February 2, 2022, in which PwC stated that the firm agrees with such dis closure, is filed as Exhibit 16.1. During fiscal years 2020 and 2021, and the subse quent interim period through February 1, 2022, we did not consult with KPMG regarding: (i) the application of accounting principles to any specified transaction, either completed or proposed, or the type of audit opinion that might be rendered on our financial statements, and nei ther was a written report or oral advice provided to us by KPMG that KPMG concluded was an important fac tor considered by us in reaching a decision as to an accounting, auditing or financial reporting issue, or (ii) any matter that was either the subject of a disagreement or reportable event as described in Item 16F(a)(1) of Form 20F.Item 16G.

Corporate Governance Novartis AG is subject to and compliant with the laws and regulations of Switzerland (in particular, Swiss com pany and securities laws, SIX Swiss Exchange rules and the Swiss Code of Best Practice for Corporate Gover nance) and the securities laws of the United States, including New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) rules, as applicable to foreign private issuers of securities. The following summarizes some significant ways in which our corporate governance practices differ from those fol lowed by domestic listed US companies under the list ing standards of the NYSE: Novartis AG shareholders do not receive written reports directly from Board committees. External auditors are appointed by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting of Shareholders (AGM), as opposed to being appointed by the Audit and Compli ance Committee. While shareholders cannot vote on all equity compen sation plans, they are entitled to hold separate, yearly binding votes on Board and Executive Committee com pensation. The Board has set up a separate Risk Committee that oversees the risk management system and processes, as opposed to delegating this responsibility to the Audit and Compliance Committee. The full Board is responsible for overseeing the performance evaluation of the Board and Executive Committee. The full Board is responsible for setting objectives rel evant to the CEO's compensation and for evaluating his performance.Item 16H. Mine Safety Disclosure 185Item 16H.

Significant accounting policies The Novartis Group (Novartis or Group) is a multinational group of companies specializing in the research, devel - opment, manufacturing and marketing of a broad range of innovative pharmaceuticals and cost-saving generic medicines. The Group is headquartered in Basel, Swit - zerland. The consolidated financial statements of the Group are prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as issued by the Interna - tional Accounting Standards Board (IASB). They are pre - pared in accordance with the historical cost convention, except for items that are required to be accounted for at fair value. The Group's financial year-end is December 31, which is also the annual closing date of the individual entities' financial statements incorporated into the Group's con - solidated financial statements. The preparation of financial statements requires management to make certain estimates and assump - tions, either at the balance sheet date or during the year, which affect the reported amounts of revenues, expenses, assets, liabilities and contingent amounts. Estimates are based on historical experience and other assumptions that are considered reasonable under the given circumstances and are regularly monitored. Actual outcomes and results could differ from those esti - mates and assumptions. Revisions to estimates are rec - ognized in the period in which the estimate is revised. Listed below are accounting policies of significance to Novartis or, in cases where IFRS provides alternatives, the option adopted by Novartis. Scope of consolidation The consolidated financial statements include all enti - ties, including structured entities, over which Novartis AG, Basel, Switzerland, directly or indirectly has control (generally as a result of owning more than 50% of the entity's voting interest). Consolidated entities are also referred to as \"subsidiaries.\" In cases where Novartis does not fully own a subsid - iary, it has elected to value any remaining outstanding non-controlling interest at the time of acquiring control of the subsidiary at its proportionate share of the fair value of the net identified assets. Investments in associated companies (generally defined as investments in entities in which Novartis holds between 20% and 50% of voting shares or over which it otherwise has significant influence) and joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method, except for selected venture fund investments for which the Group has elected to apply the method of fair value through the consolidated income statement.Foreign currencies The consolidated financial statements of Novartis are presented in US dollars (USD). The functional currency of a subsidiary is generally the local currency of that respective entity. The functional currency used for the reporting of certain Swiss and foreign finance entities is USD instead of their respective local currencies. This reflects the fact that the cash flows and transactions of these entities are primarily denominated in this currency. For subsidiaries not operating in hyperinflationary economies, the subsidiary's results, financial position and cash flows that do not have USD as their functional currency are translated into USD using the following exchange rates: Income, expense and cash flows for each month using the average exchange rate, with the US dollar values for each month being aggregated during the year Balance sheet using year-end exchange rates Resulting exchange rate differences are recognized in other comprehensive income For subsidiaries operating in hyperinflationary econo - mies, the impact of the restatement of the non-monetary assets and liabilities with the general price index at the beginning of the period is recorded in retained earnings in equity. The subsequent gains or losses resulting from the restatement of non-monetary assets are recorded in \"Other financial income and expense\" in the consoli - dated income statement. Non-current assets held for sale or held for distribution to owners Non-current assets are accounted for as assets held for sale or as related to discontinued operations when their carrying amount is to be recovered principally through a sale transaction or distribution to owners and a sale or distribution to owners is considered highly probable. They are stated at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell and any resulting impairment is recognized. Assets related to discontinued operations and assets of a disposal group held for sale are not depreciated or amortized. The prior year consolidated balance sheet is not restated. If in a subsequent period, the criteria for classifica - tion as held for sale are no longer met, the recoverable amount of assets and liabilities are reclassified out of assets held for sale into the respective balance sheet lines and the prior year consolidated balance sheet is not restated. The cumulative amount of depreciation and amortization not recorded since the date of their classi - fication as assets held for sale, and any required adjust - ments to the recoverable amounts of assets are recog - nized in the consolidated income statement.Notes to the Novartis Group consolidated financial statements F-7Distribution of Alcon Inc. to Novartis AG shareholders During the first quarter of 2019, at the Annual General Meeting (AGM) of Novartis AG shareholders, held on February 28, 2019, the Novartis AG shareholders approved a special distribution by way of a dividend in kind to effect the spin-off of Alcon Inc. The February 28, 2019, shareholder approval for the spin-off required the Alcon Division and selected por - tions of corporate activities attributable to Alcon's busi - ness (the \"Alcon business\") to be reported as discontin - ued operations. The shareholder approval to spin off the Alcon busi - ness also required the recognition of a distribution liabil - ity at the fair value of the Alcon business. The Group elected to measure the distribution liability at the fair value of the Alcon business net assets taken as a whole. The distribution liability was recognized through a reduc - tion in retained earnings. It was required to be adjusted at each balance sheet date for changes in its estimated fair value, up to the date of the distribution to sharehold - ers through retained earnings. Any resulting impairment of the business assets to be distributed would have been recognized in the consolidated income statements in \"Other expense\" of discontinued operations, at the date of initial recognition of the distribution liability or at sub - sequent dates resulting from changes of the distribution liability valuation. At the April 8, 2019, distribution settle - ment date, the resulting gain, which was measured as the excess amount of the distribution liability over the then-carrying value of the net assets of the business dis - tributed, was recognized on the line \"Gain on distribution of Alcon Inc. to Novartis AG shareholders\" in the income statement of discontinued operations. The recognition of the distribution liability required the use of valuation techniques for purposes of impair - ment testing of the Alcon business' assets to be distrib - uted and for the measurement of the fair value of the dis - tribution liability. These valuations required the use of management assumptions and estimates related to the Alcon business' future cash flows, market multiples to estimate day one market value, and control premiums to apply in estimating the Alcon business fair value. These fair value measurements were classified as \"Level 3\" in the fair value hierarchy. The section \"\u2014Impairment of goodwill and intangible assets\" in this Note 1 provides additional information on key assumptions that are highly sensitive in the estimation of fair values using valuation techniques. Transaction costs that were directly attributable to the distribution (spin-off) of Alcon to the Novartis share - holders, and that would otherwise have been avoided, were recorded to equity. For additional disclosures, refer to \"Note 2. Signifi - cant transactions\u2014Significant transactions in 2019\u2014 Completion of the spin-off of the Alcon business through a dividend in kind distribution to Novartis AG sharehold - ers,\" and \"Note 30. Discontinued operations.\"Acquisition of assets and businesses Assets separately acquired are recorded at cost, which includes the purchase price and any directly attributable costs for bringing the asset into the condition to operate as intended. Expected costs for obligations to disman - tle and remove property, plant and equipment and restore the site when it is no longer used are included in their cost. Acquired businesses are accounted for by applying the acquisition method, unless the optional concentra - tion test is applied. The optional concentration test allows for an election on a transaction-by-transaction basis to account for the acquired business as an asset separately acquired when substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired is concentrated in a single identifiable asset or group of similar identifiable assets. The acquisition method requires that the assets acquired and liabilities assumed be recorded at their respective fair values on the date the Group obtains con - trol. The excess of the fair value of the total purchase consideration transferred over the fair value of the acquired assets and assumed liabilities is recognized as goodwill. The valuations are based on information avail - able at the acquisition date. Acquisition related costs are expensed as incurred. The application of the acquisition method requires certain estimates and assumptions to be made, espe - cially concerning the fair values of the acquired intangi - ble assets, inventories, property, plant and equipment and the liabilities assumed at the acquisition date, and the useful lives of the intangible assets and property, plant and equipment. Estimates of fair value require the use of valuation techniques. These valuations require the use of management assumptions and estimates, includ - ing the value of comparable assets in the market, amount and timing of future cash flows, outcomes and costs of research and development activities, probability of obtaining regulatory approval, long-term sales forecasts, actions of competitors, discount rates and terminal growth rates. The section \"\u2014Impairment of goodwill and intangible assets\" in this Note 1 provides additional infor - mation on key assumptions that are highly sensitive in the estimation of fair values using valuation techniques. Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment is depreciated on a straight-line basis in the consolidated income statement over the estimated useful life of the individual asset. Free - hold land is not depreciated. The related depreciation expense is included in the costs of the functions using the asset. Property, plant and equipment is assessed for impair - ment whenever there is an indication that the balance sheet carrying amount may not be recoverable using cash flow projections over the useful life.Notes to the Novartis Group consolidated financial statements F-8The following table shows the estimated useful life by major categories for property, plant and equipment: Useful life Buildings 20 to 40 years Machinery and other equipment Machinery and equipment 7 to 20 years Furniture and vehicles 5 to 10 years Computer hardware 3 to 7 years Government grants obtained for construction activities, including any related equipment, are deducted from the gross acquisition cost to arrive at the balance sheet car - rying value of the related assets. Leases and right-of-use assets As lessee, at inception and upon the modification of a contract the Group assesses whether the contract con - tains a lease. The Group elected to allocate the consid - eration in the contract to the lease and non-lease com - ponents on the basis of the relative standalone price of each component. The Group recognizes a right-of-use asset and a cor - responding lease liability for all arrangements in which it is a lessee, except for leases with a term of 12 months or less (short-term leases) and low-value leases. For these short-term and low-value leases, the Group rec - ognizes the lease payments as an operating expense on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. The lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the future lease payments as from the com - mencement date of the lease to the end of the lease term. The lease term includes the period of any lease exten - sion that management assess as reasonably certain to be exercised by the Group. The lease payments are dis - counted using the interest rate implicit in the lease or, if not readily determinable, the Novartis incremental bor - rowing rate for the asset subject to the lease in the rel - evant market. The Group remeasures the lease liability (and makes a corresponding adjustment to the related right-of-use asset) whenever there is a change to the lease terms or expected payments under the lease, or a modification that is not accounted for as a separate lease. The portion of the lease payments attributable to the repayment of lease liabilities is recognized in cash flows used in financing activities, and the portion attributable to the payment of interest is included in cash flows from operating activities. Right-of-use assets are initially recognized on the bal - ance sheet at cost, which comprises the amount of the initial measurement of the corresponding lease liability, adjusted for any lease payments made at or prior to the commencement date of the lease, any lease incentive received, and any initial direct costs incurred by Novartis, and expected costs for obligations to dismantle and remove right-of-use assets when they are no longer used. Right-of-use assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis from the commencement date of the lease over the shorter of the useful life of the right-of-use asset or the end of the lease term. Right-of-use assets are assessed for impairment whenever there is an indication that the balance sheet carrying amount may not be recoverable using cash flow projections for the useful life. In arrangements where the Group is the lessor, it determines at lease inception whether the lease is a finance lease or an operating lease. Leases that trans - fer substantially all of the risk and rewards incidental to ownership of the underlying asset to the counterparty (the lessee) are accounted for as finance leases. Leases that do not transfer substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership are accounted for as operating leases. Operating lease payments received are recog - nized on a straight-line basis over the lease term in the consolidated income statement in either \"net sales\" or \"other income,\" depending on the nature of the underly- ing asset to the lease arrangement. Goodwill and intangible assets Goodwill Goodwill arises on applying the acquisition method on the acquisition of a business and is the excess of the fair value of the consideration transferred to acquire the business over the underlying fair value of the net identi - fied assets acquired. It is allocated to groups of cash-gen - erating units (CGUs), which are usually represented by the reported segments. Goodwill is tested for impairment annually at the level of these groups of CGUs, and any impairment charges are recorded under \"Other expense\" in the consolidated income statement. Intangible assets available for use Novartis has the following classes of available for use intangible assets: currently marketed products; technol - ogies and other intangible assets (including computer software). Currently marketed products represent the compos - ite value of acquired intellectual property (IP), patents, distribution rights and product trade names. Technologies represent identified and separable acquired know-how used in the research, development and production processes. Significant investments in internally developed and acquired computer software are capitalized and included in the \"Other\" category, and amortized once available for use. Intangible assets available for use with a definite use - ful life are amortized over their estimated useful lives on a straight-line basis and are evaluated for potential Notes to the Novartis Group consolidated financial statements F-9impairment whenever facts and circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable. The following table shows the estimated useful life by major categories for intangible assets available for use and the line in the consolidated income statement in which the amortization and any potential impairment charge is recognized: Income statement line for amortization and Useful life impairment charges Currently marketed products 5 to 20 years \"Cost of goods sold\" Technologies 10 to 20 years \"Cost of goods sold\" or \"Research and development\" Other (including 3 to 12 years In the relevant computer software) functional expense Intangible assets not yet available for use Acquired research and development intangible assets that have not yet obtained marketing approval are rec - ognized as in-process research and development (IPR&D). IPR&D is not amortized, but is evaluated for potential impairment on an annual basis or when facts and circum - stances warrant. Any impairment charge is recorded in the consolidated income statement under \"Research and development.\" Once a project included in IPR&D has received marketing approval from a regulatory authority, it is transferred to the \"Currently marketed products\" cat - egory. Impairment of goodwill and intangible assets An asset, a CGU or a grouping of CGUs is considered impaired when its balance sheet carrying amount exceeds its estimated recoverable amount, which is defined as the higher of its fair value less costs of dis - posal and its value in use. Usually, Novartis applies the fair value less costs of disposal method for its impair - ment assessment. In most cases, no directly observable market inputs are available to measure the fair value less costs of disposal. Therefore, an estimate is derived indi - rectly and is based on net present value techniques uti - lizing post-tax cash flows and discount rates. In the lim - ited cases where the value-in-use method would be applied, net present value techniques would be applied using pre-tax cash flows and discount rates. Fair value less costs of disposal reflects estimates of assumptions that market participants would be expected to use when pricing the asset or CGU, and for this pur - pose, management considers the range of economic conditions that are expected to exist over the remaining useful life of the asset. The estimates used in calculating the net present val - ues are highly sensitive and depend on assumptions spe - cific to the nature of the Group's activities with regard to: Amount and timing of projected future cash flows Long-term sales forecasts Actions of competitors (launch of competing products, marketing initiatives, etc.) Sales erosion rates after the end of patent or other intellectual property rights protection, and timing of the entry of generic competition Outcome of research and development activities (com - pound efficacy, results of clinical trials, etc.) Amount and timing of projected costs to develop IPR&D into commercially viable products Profit margins Probability of obtaining regulatory approval Future tax rate Appropriate terminal growth rate Appropriate discount rate Generally, for intangible assets with a definite useful life, Novartis uses cash flow projections for the whole useful life of these assets. For goodwill, Novartis generally uti - lizes cash flow projections for a five-year period based on management forecasts, with a terminal value based on cash flow projections usually in line with inflation rates for later periods. Probability-weighted scenarios are typically used. Discount rates used consider the Group's estimated weighted average cost of capital, adjusted for specific asset, country and currency risks associated with cash flow projections, to approximate the discount rate that market participants would use to value the asset. Due to the above factors, actual cash flows and val - ues could vary significantly from forecasted future cash flows and related values derived using discounting tech - niques. Impairment of associated companies accounted for at equity Novartis considers investments in associated compa - nies for impairment evaluation whenever objective evi - dence indicates the net investment may be impaired, including when a quoted share price indicates a fair value less than the per-share balance sheet carrying value for the investment. If the recoverable amount of the investment is esti - mated to be lower than the balance sheet carrying amount, an impairment charge is recognized for the dif - ference in the consolidated income statement under \"Income from associated companies.\" Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents include highly liquid invest - ments with original maturities of three months or less, which are readily convertible to known amounts of cash. Bank overdrafts are usually presented within current financial debts on the consolidated balance sheet, except in cases where a right of offset has been agreed with a bank, which allows for presentation on a net basis.Notes to the Novartis Group consolidated financial statements F-10Marketable securities, commodities and non-current financial assets Commodities, which include gold bullion or coins, are valued at the lower of cost or fair value using current market prices. The changes in fair value below cost are immediately recorded in \"Other financial income and expense.\" Marketable securities are financial assets held for short-term purposes which are principally traded in liq - uid markets and are classified within current assets on the consolidated balance sheet. The financial impacts related to these financial assets are recorded in \"Other financial income and expense\" in the consolidated income statement. Non-current financial assets held for long-term strategic purposes are classified within non-current assets on the consolidated balance sheet. The financial impacts related to these financial assets are recorded in \"Other income\" and \"Other expense\" in the consolidated income statement. Marketable securities and non-current financial assets are initially recorded at fair value on their trade date, which is different from the settlement date when the transaction is ultimately effected. Quoted securities are remeasured at each reporting date to fair value based on current market prices. If the market for a financial asset is not active or no market is available, fair values are established using valuation techniques. The major - ity of non-quoted investments are initially valued at fair value through the purchase price established between a willing buyer and seller. Non-quoted investments are subsequently adjusted based on values derived from dis - counted cash flow analysis or other pricing models. These investment values are classified as \"Level 3\" in the fair value hierarchy. The Group classifies and accounts for its marketable securities and non-current financial assets in the follow - ing categories: Debt securities are valued at fair value through other comprehensive income with subsequent recycling into the consolidated income statement, as they meet both the \"solely payment of principal and interest\" and the business model criteria. Unrealized gains and losses, except exchange gains and losses, are recorded as a fair value adjustment in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income. They are recognized in the consolidated income statement when the debt instru - ment is sold, at which time the gain is transferred to \"Other financial income and expense.\" Exchange gains and losses related to debt instruments are immediately recognized in the consolidated income statement in \"Other financial income and expense.\" Fund investments and equity securities of the Novartis Venture Fund are valued at fair value through profit and loss (FVPL). Unrealized gains and losses, including exchange gains and losses, are recognized in the con - solidated income statement in \"Other income\" for gains and \"Other expense\" for losses. Equity securities held as strategic investments, typi - cally held outside of the Novartis Venture Fund, are generally designated at the date of acquisition as finan - cial assets valued at fair value through other compre - hensive income with no subsequent recycling through profit and loss. Unrealized gains and losses, including exchange gains and losses, are recorded as a fair value adjustment in the consolidated statement of compre - hensive income. They are reclassified to retained earn - ings when the equity security is sold. If these equity securities are not designated at the date of acquisition as financial assets valued at fair value through other comprehensive income, they are valued at FVPL, as described above. Other non-current financial assets, such as loans and long-term receivables from customers, advances and other deposits, are valued at amortized cost, which reflects the time value of money less any allowances for expected credit losses. The Group assesses on a forward-looking basis the expected credit losses associated with its debt securi - ties valued at fair value through other comprehensive income. Impairments on debt securities are recorded in \"Other financial income and expense.\" For other financial assets valued at amortized cost, impairments, which are based on their expected credit losses, and exchange rate losses are included in \"Other expense\" in the consolidated income statement. Exchange rate gains and interest income, using the effec - tive interest rate method, are included in \"Other income\" or \"Other financial income\" in the consolidated income statement, depending on the nature of the item. Derivative financial instruments Derivative financial instruments are initially recognized in the balance sheet at fair value and are remeasured to their current fair value at the end of each subsequent reporting period. The valuation of a forward exchange rate contract is based on the discounted cash flow model, using interest curves and forward rates at the reporting date as observable inputs. Options are valued based on a modified Black- Scholes model using volatility and exercise prices as major observable inputs. The Group utilizes derivative financial instruments for the purpose of hedging to reduce the volatility in the Group's performance due to the exposure to various business-related risks. To mitigate these risks, the Group enters into certain derivative financial instruments. The risk reduction is obtained because the derivative's value or cash flows are expected, wholly or partly, to offset changes in the value or cash flows of the recognized assets or liabilities. The overall strategy is aiming to mit - igate the currency and interest rate risk of positions that are contractually agreed, and to partially mitigate the exposure risk of selected anticipated transactions. Certain derivative financial instruments meet the criteria for hedge accounting treatment. A prerequisite for obtaining this accounting-hedge relationship is exten - sive documentation on inception and proving on a regu - lar basis that the economic hedge is effective for account - ing purposes. Other derivative financial instruments do not meet the criteria to qualify for hedge accounting. Changes in the fair value of these derivative instruments are recognized immediately in \"Other financial income and expense\" in the consolidated income statement.Notes to the Novartis Group consolidated financial statements F-11In addition, the Group has designated certain long- term debt components as hedges of the translation risk arising on certain net investments in foreign operations. On consolidation, foreign currency differences arising on long-term debt designated as net investment hedges of a foreign operation are recognized in other compre - hensive income and accumulated in currency translation effects, to the extent that the hedge is effective. The for - eign currency differences arising from hedge ineffective - ness are recognized in the income statement in \"Other financial income and expense.\" When a hedged net investment is disposed of, the proportionate portion of the cumulative amount recog - nized in equity in relation to the hedged net investment is transferred to the consolidated income statement as an adjustment to the gain or loss on disposal. Inventories Inventory is valued at the lower of acquisition or produc - tion cost determined on a first-in, first-out basis and net realizable value. This value is used for the \"Cost of goods sold\" in the consolidated income statement. Unsaleable inventory is fully written off in the consolidated income statement under \"Cost of goods sold.\" T rade receivables Trade receivables are initially recognized at their invoiced amounts, including any related sales taxes less adjust - ments for estimated revenue deductions such as rebates, chargebacks and cash discounts. Provisions for doubtful trade receivables are estab - lished using a forward-looking expected credit loss model (ECL), which includes possible default events on the trade receivables over the entire holding period of the trade receivable. These provisions represent the dif - ference between the trade receivable's carrying amount in the consolidated balance sheet and the estimated col - lectible amount. Charges for doubtful trade receivables are recorded as marketing and selling costs recognized in the consolidated income statement within \"Selling, general and administration\" expenses. Legal and environmental liabilities Novartis and its subsidiaries are subject to contingen - cies arising in the ordinary course of business, such as patent litigation, environmental remediation liabilities and other product-related and commercial litigation, and gov - ernmental investigations and proceedings. A provision is recorded where a reliable estimate can be made of the probable outcome of legal or other disputes against the subsidiary. Contingent consideration In an acquisition or divestment of a business, it is nec - essary to recognize contingent future amounts due to previous owners, representing contractually defined potential amounts as a liability or an asset. Usually for Novartis, these are linked to milestone or royalty pay - ments related to certain assets and are recognized as a financial liability or financial asset at fair value, which is then remeasured at each subsequent reporting date. These estimations typically depend on factors such as technical milestones or market performance, and are adjusted for the probability of their likelihood of payment, and are appropriately discounted to reflect the impact of time. Changes in the fair value of contingent consideration liabilities in subsequent periods are recognized in the consolidated income statement in \"Cost of goods sold\" for currently marketed products and in \"Research and development\" for IPR&D. Changes in contingent consid - assets are recognized in \"Other income\" or \"Other expense,\" depending on their nature. The effect of unwinding the discount over time is rec - ognized for contingent liabilities in \"Interest expense\" and for contingent assets as interest income recognized in the consolidated income statement within \"Other financial income and expense.\" Defined benefit pension plans and other post-employment benefits The liability in respect of defined benefit pension plans and other post-employment benefits is the defined ben - efit obligation calculated annually by independent actu - aries using the projected unit credit method. The current service cost for such post- employment benefit plans is included in the personnel expenses of the various func - tions in which employees are employed, while the net interest on the net defined benefit liability or asset is recognized as \"Other expense\" or \"Other income.\" T reasury shares Treasury shares are initially recorded at fair value on their trade date, which is different from the settlement date, when the transaction is ultimately effected. Treasury shares are deducted from consolidated equity at their nominal value of CHF 0.50 per share. Differences between the nominal amount and the transaction price on purchases or sales of treasury shares with third par - ties, or the value of services received for the shares allo - cated to employees as part of share-based compensa - tion arrangements, are recorded in \"Retained earnings\" in the consolidated statement of changes in equity. Revenue recognition Revenue on the sale of Novartis Group products and ser - vices, which is recorded as \"Net sales\" in the consoli - dated income statement, is recognized when a contrac - tual promise to a customer (performance obligation) has been fulfilled by transferring control over the promised goods and services to the customer, substantially all of which is at the point in time of shipment to or receipt of the products by the customer or when the services are performed. If contracts contain customer acceptance Notes to the Novartis Group consolidated financial statements F-12provisions, revenue is recognized upon the satisfaction of the acceptance criteria. If products are stockpiled at the request of the customer, revenue is only recognized once the products have been inspected and accepted by the customer, and there is no right of return or replen - ishment on product expiry. The amount of revenue rec - ognized is based on the consideration Novartis expects to receive in exchange for its goods and services, when it is highly probable that a significant reversal will not occur. If a contract contains more than one performance obligation, the consideration is allocated based on the standalone selling price of each performance obligation. The consideration Novartis receives in exchange for its goods or services may be fixed or variable. Variable consideration is only recognized when it is highly prob - able that a significant reversal will not occur. The most common elements of variable consideration are listed below. Rebates and discounts granted to government agen - cies, wholesalers, retail pharmacies, managed health - care organizations and other customers, as well as chargebacks are provisioned and recorded as revenue deductions at the time the related revenues are recorded, or when the incentives are offered. They are calculated on the basis of historical experience, regu - lations, specific terms in the individual agreements, product pricing and the mix of products, contracts, channels and payors. Refunds granted to healthcare providers under innovative pay-for-performance agreements (i.e., out - come based arrangements) are provisioned and recorded as a revenue deduction at the time the related sales are recorded. They are calculated on the basis of historical experience and clinical data available for the product, as well as specific terms of the individual agreements. In cases where historical experience and clinical data are not sufficient for a reliable estimation of the outcome, revenue recognition is deferred until the uncertainty is resolved or until such history is avail - able. Cash discounts are offered to customers to encourage prompt payment and are provisioned and recorded as revenue deductions at the time the related sales are recorded. Shelf stock adjustments are generally granted to cus - tomers, primarily of the Sandoz Division, to cover the inventory held by them at the time a price decline becomes effective. Revenue deduction provisions for shelf stock adjustments are recorded when the price decline is anticipated, based on the impact of the price decline on the customer's estimated inventory levels. Sales returns provisions are recognized and recorded as revenue deductions when there is historical expe - rience of Novartis agreeing to customer returns and Novartis can reasonably estimate expected future returns. In doing so, the estimated rate of return is applied, determined on the basis of historical experi - ence of customer returns and considering any other relevant factors. This is applied to the amounts invoiced, also considering the amount of returned products to be destroyed versus products that can be placed back in inventory for resale. Where shipments are made on a resale or return basis, without sufficient historical experience for estimating sales returns, revenue is only recorded when there is evidence of consumption or when the right of return has expired. Net sales and provisions for revenue deductions are adjusted to actual amounts as rebates, refunds, dis - counts and returns are processed. The provision rep - resents estimates of the related obligations, requiring the use of judgment when estimating the effect of these sales deductions. \"Other revenue\" includes income from profit-sharing arrangements with our collaboration partners, and roy - alty and milestone income from the out-licensing of intel - lectual property when Novartis retains an interest in the intellectual property through a license. Royalty income earned from a license is recognized when the underly- ing sales have occurred. Milestone income is recognized at the point in time when it is highly probable that the rel - evant milestone event criteria are met, and the risk of reversal of revenue recognition is remote. Other revenue also includes revenue from activities such as manufac - turing or other services rendered, to the extent such rev - enue is not recorded under net sales, and is recognized when control transfers to the third party and our perfor - mance obligations are satisfied. Research and development Internal research and development (R&D) costs are fully charged to \"Research and development\" in the consol - idated income statement in the period in which they are incurred. The Group considers that regulatory and other uncertainties inherent in the development of new prod - ucts preclude the capitalization of internal development expenses as an intangible asset until marketing approval from a regulatory authority is obtained in a major market such as the United States, the European Union, Switzer - land or Japan. Payments made to third parties, such as contract research and development organizations in compensa - tion for subcontracted R&D, that are deemed not to transfer intellectual property to Novartis are expensed as internal R&D expenses in the period in which they are incurred. Such payments are only capitalized if they meet the criteria for recognition of an internally generated intangible asset, usually when marketing approval has been received from a regulatory authority in a major mar - ket. Payments made to third parties to in-license or acquire intellectual property rights, compounds and products, including initial upfront and subsequent mile - stone payments, are capitalized, as are payments for other assets, such as technologies to be used in R&D activities. If additional payments are made to the origi - nator company to continue performing R&D activities, an evaluation is made as to the nature of the payments. Such additional payments will be expensed if they are deemed to be compensation for subcontracted R&D services not resulting in an additional transfer of intellectual property rights to Novartis. Such additional payments will be cap - italized if they are deemed to be compensation for the transfer to Novartis of additional intellectual property developed at the risk of the originator company. Subse -Notes to the Novartis Group consolidated financial statements F-13quent internal R&D costs in relation to IPR&D and other assets are expensed, since the technical feasibility of the internal R&D activity can only be demonstrated by the receipt of marketing approval for a related product from a regulatory authority in a major market. Costs for post-approval studies performed to sup - port the continued registration of a marketed product are recognized as marketing expenses. Costs for activ - ities that are required by regulatory authorities as a con - dition for obtaining marketing approval in a major market are capitalized and recognized as currently marketed products. Inventory produced ahead of regulatory approval is fully provisioned, and the charge is included in \"Other expense\" in the consolidated income statement, as its ultimate use cannot be assured. If this inventory can sub - sequently be sold, the provision is released to \"Other income\" in the consolidated income statement, either on approval by the appropriate regulatory authority or, exceptionally in Europe, on recommendation by the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP), if approval is virtually certain. Share-based compensation Vested Novartis shares and American Depositary Receipts (ADRs) that are granted as compensation are valued at their market value on the grant date and are immediately expensed in the consolidated income state - ment. The fair values of unvested restricted shares (RSs), restricted share units (RSUs) and performance share units (PSUs) in Novartis shares and ADRs granted to employees as compensation are recognized as an expense over the related vesting period. The expense recorded in the consolidated income statement is included in the personnel expenses of the various func - tions in which the employees are employed. Unvested restricted shares, restricted ADRs and RSUs are only conditional on the provision of services by the plan participant during the vesting period. They are valued at fair value on the grant date. As RSUs do not entitle the holder to dividends, the fair value is based on the Novartis share price at the grant date adjusted for the net present value of the dividends expected to be paid during the holding period. The fair value of these grants, after making adjustments for assumptions related to forfeiture during the vesting period, is expensed on a straight-line basis over the respective vesting period. PSUs are subject to the achievement of certain per - formance criteria during the vesting period and require plan participants to provide services during this period. The following paragraphs provide an overview of the accounting policies for the share-based compensation plans that grant PSUs. For PSUs that are subject to performance criteria based on Novartis internal performance metrics and that are conditional on the provision of service by plan par - ticipants during the vesting period, the expense is rec - ognized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, and is determined based on assumptions concerning the expected performance against the internal performance metrics throughout the vesting period. The assumptions are based on the Group's targets for those performance metrics, and the expected forfeitures due to plan partic - ipants not meeting their service conditions. The assump - tions are periodically adjusted over the vesting period. Any change in estimates for past services is recorded immediately as an expense or income in the consolidated income statement, and amounts for the remaining vest - ing period are expensed on a straight-line basis. As a result, at the end of the vesting period, the charge during the entire vesting period represents the amount that will finally vest. The number of equity instruments that finally vest is determined at the vesting date. For PSUs that are subject to performance criteria based on variables that can be observed in the market, which for Novartis plans is the Novartis total shareholder return (TSR) relative to a specific peer group of compa - nies over the vesting period, and that are conditional on the provision of services by the plan participants during the vesting period, the expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, and is deter - mined based on the total fair value of the grant over the vesting period. IFRS requires that these variables that can be observed in the market are taken into account in determining the fair value of the PSUs at the grant date. Novartis determined the fair value of these PSUs at the date of grant using a Monte Carlo simulation model. Adjustments to the number of equity instruments granted are only made if a plan participant does not fulfill the ser - vice conditions. For PSUs granted under plans that are subject to both performance criteria based on Novartis internal perfor - mance metrics and Novartis TSR relative to a specific peer group of companies over the vesting period and that are conditional on the provision of service by plan participants during the vesting period, the expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, and is determined based on a bifurcation into the components based on the performance criteria related to Novartis internal performance metrics and TSR, as described in the paragraphs above. Measuring the fair values of PSUs granted that include TSR performance criteria requires use of esti - mates. The Monte Carlo simulation used to determine the fair value of the PSUs TSR performance criteria requires the probability of factors related to uncertain future events; the term of the award; the grant price of underlying shares or ADRs; expected volatilities; the expected correlation matrix of the underlying equity instruments with those of the peer group of companies; and the risk-free interest rate as input parameters. If a plan participant leaves Novartis for reasons other than retirement, disability or death, then unvested restricted shares, restricted ADRs, RSUs and PSUs are forfeited, unless determined otherwise by the provision of the plan rules or by the Compensation Committee of the Novartis Board of Directors, for example, in connec - tion with a reorganization or divestment. Government grants Grants from governments or similar organizations are recognized at their fair value when there is reasonable Notes to the Novartis Group consolidated financial statements F-14assurance that the grant will be received and the Group will comply with all attached conditions. Government grants received to compensate costs are deferred and recognized in the consolidated income statement over the period necessary to match them against the related costs that they are intended to com - pensate. The accounting policy for property, plant and equip - ment describes the treatment of any related grants. Restructuring charges Restructuring provisions are recognized for the direct expenditures arising from the restructuring, where the plans are sufficiently detailed and where appropriate communication to those affected has been made. Charges to increase restructuring provisions are included in \"Other expense\" in the consolidated income statements. Corresponding releases are recorded in \"Other income\" in the consolidated income statement. Healthcare contributions Healthcare contribution levies and fees under govern - mental programs that require the Group to contribute to a country's healthcare costs, other than programs described in \"Revenue recognition\" in this Note 1, are recognized in \"Other expense\" in the consolidated income statement. Provisions for healthcare contribu - tions are adjusted to the actual amounts levied. The pro - vision represents estimates of the related obligations, requiring the use of judgment when estimating the effect of these healthcare contributions. Income taxes Taxes on income are recorded in the same periods as the revenues and expenses to which they relate and include interest and penalties incurred during the period. Deferred taxes are determined using the comprehensive liability method and are calculated on the temporary dif - ferences that arise between the tax base of an asset or liability and its carrying value in the balance sheet pre - pared for consolidation purposes, except for those tem - porary differences related to investments in subsidiaries and associated companies, where the timing of their reversal can be controlled and it is probable that the dif - ference will not reverse in the foreseeable future. Since the retained earnings are reinvested, withholding or other taxes on eventual distribution of a subsidiary's retained earnings are only taken into account when a dividend has been planned. The estimated amounts for current and deferred tax assets or liabilities, including any amounts related to any uncertain tax positions, are based on currently known facts and circumstances. Tax returns are based on an interpretation of tax laws and regulations, and reflect estimates based on these judgments and interpretations. The tax returns are subject to examination by the com - petent taxing authorities, which may result in an assess - ment being made requiring payments of additional tax, interest or penalties. Inherent uncertainties exist in the estimates of the tax positions. Impact of adopting significant new IFRS standard in 2021 The following new IFRS standard has been adopted by Novartis from January 1, 2021: Interest Rate Benchmark Reform - Phase 2, Amendments to IFRS 9, IAS 39, IFRS 7, IFRS 4 and IFRS 16 (Interest Benchmark Reform Amendments) Interest Benchmark Reform Amendments became effec - tive from January 1, 2021. These amendments address issues that might affect financial reporting when an exist - ing interest rate benchmark (i.e. Interbank offered rate - IBOR) is replaced with an alternative benchmark inter - est rate. The effects of interest rate benchmark reform on the Group's financial instruments and risk manage - ment strategies did not have a material impact on the Group's consolidated financial statements and are not expected to have a significant impact in future periods. There are no other IFRS standards or interpretations not yet effective that would be expected to have a material impact on the Group. Impact of adopting significant new IFRS standard in 2020 The following new IFRS standard has been adopted by Novartis from January 1, 2020: IFRS 3 Business Combinations amendments The IASB issued amendments to IFRS 3 Business Com - binations that revised the definition of a business, which assist entities with the evaluation of when an asset or group of assets acquired should be considered a busi - ness. This amended standard has been applied to trans - actions entered into on or after January 1, 2020. The amended standard allows an entity to apply an optional concentration test, on a transaction-by-transaction basis, to evaluate whether substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired is concentrated in a single identifiable asset or group of similar identifiable assets. If this optional concentration test is met, the set of activities and assets is determined not to be a busi - ness. The adoption of this amended standard on Janu - ary 1, 2020, did not have a significant impact on our con - solidated financial statements and is not expected to have a significant impact in future periods. However, this will depend on the facts and circumstances of future transactions and if the Group decides to apply the optional concentration test in the assessment of whether an acquired set of activities and assets is or is not a busi - ness.Notes to the Novartis Group consolidated financial statements F-15Impact of adopting significant new IFRS standard in 2019 The following new IFRS standard has been adopted by Novartis from January 1, 2019: IFRS 16 Leases IFRS 16 Leases substantially changed the financial state - ments, as the majority of leases for which the Group is the lessee became on-balance sheet liabilities with cor - responding right-of-use assets also recognized on the balance sheet. The lease liability reflects the net pres - ent value of the remaining lease payments, and the right- of-use asset corresponds to the lease liability, adjusted for payments made before the commencement date, lease incentives and other items related to the lease agreement. The standard replaces IAS 17 Leases and related interpretations. Upon adoption of the new standard, a portion of the annual operating lease costs, which was previously fully recognized as functional expenses, as a component of operating income, was recorded as interest expense. In addition, the portion of the lease payments that rep - resents the reduction of the lease liability is recognized in the cash flow statement as an outflow from financing activities, which was previously fully recognized as an outflow from operating activities. Given the leases involved, these effects are not significant to the consol - idated income statement and consolidated statement of cash flow. The Group implemented the new standard on Janu - ary 1, 2019, and applied the modified retrospective method, with right-of-use assets measured at an amount equal to the lease liability, adjusted by the amount of the prepaid or accrued lease payments relating to those leases recognized in the balance sheet immediately before the date of initial application. The Group did not restate prior years.Results of our impact assessment: The undiscounted operating lease commitments as of December 31, 2018, amounted to USD 3.6 billion. This includes approximately USD 0.1 billion of leases with a commencement date in 2019, as well as short-term leases and low-value leases that are recognized from January 1, 2019, upon adoption of IFRS 16, on a straight- line basis as expense in profit and loss. This also includes USD 0.2 billion lease commitments related to the Alcon Division, which is attributable to discontinued operation in 2019. For the remaining undiscounted lease commit - ments attributable to continuing operations of USD 3.3 billion, the Group recognized on January 1, 2019, lease liabilities of USD 1.74 billion and right-of-use assets of USD 1.55 billion (after the reclassification of USD 0.1 bil- lion from property, plant and equipment, and net adjust - ments for the USD 0.3 billion recognition of sublease receivables, prepayments and accrued lease payments recognized as at December 31, 2018). For the lease com - mitments attributable to discontinued operations, the Group recognized on January 1, 2019, lease liabilities and right-of-use assets of USD 0.2 billion. This does not include the discontinued operations right-of-use assets and lease liability on finance lease agreements of USD 75 million and USD 89 million, respectively. There was an insignificant increase to retained earnings upon adop - tion of IFRS 16 of USD 3 million that arose from subleases that were accounted for as operating lease agreements under IAS 17 and are accounted for as finance leases under IFRS 16. As a lessor, the Group had no significant impact upon adoption. For additional significant accounting policies applicable to the discontinued operations business, see Note 30. 2. Significant transactions The Group applied the acquisition method of account - ing for businesses acquired, and did not elect to apply the optional concentration test to account for acquired business as an asset separately acquired. Significant transactions in 2021 Sandoz - acquisition of GSK's cephalosporin antibiotics business On February 10, 2021, Sandoz entered into an agreement with certain subsidiaries of GlaxoSmithKline plc (GSK) for the acquisition of the GSK's cephalosporin antibiot - ics business.

Significant pending transactions Innovative Medicines - acquisition of Gyroscope Therapeutics Holdings plc On December 22, 2021, Novartis entered into an agree - ment to acquire Gyroscope Therapeutics Holdings plc (Gyroscope), a UK-based ocular gene therapy company. Gyroscope focuses on the discovery and development of gene therapy treatments for retinal indications.

The acquisition is expected to close in the first quar - ter of 2022. Completion of the acquisition is subject to customary closing conditions. Significant transactions in 2020 Innovative Medicines - acquisition of The Medicines Company On November 23, 2019, Novartis entered into an agree - ment and plan of merger (\"the Merger Agreement\") with The Medicines Company, a US-based pharmaceutical company headquartered in Parsippany, New Jersey, USA. Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, on December 5, 2019, Novartis, through a subsidiary, commenced a tender offer to acquire all outstanding shares of The Medicines Company for USD 85 per share, or a total con - sideration of approximately USD 9.6 billion in cash on a fully diluted basis, including the equivalent share value related to The Medicines Company's convertible notes, in accordance with their terms. The tender offer expired on January 3, 2020, and on January 6, 2020, the acquir - ing subsidiary merged with and into The Medicines Com - pany, resulting in The Medicines Company becoming an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Novartis. Novartis financed the transaction through available cash, and short- and long-term borrowings. The Medicines Company is focused on the develop - ment of inclisiran, a potentially first-in-class, twice yearly therapy that allows administration during patients' rou - tine visits to their healthcare professionals and will poten - tially contribute to improved patient adherence and sus - tained lower LDL-C levels. The fair value of the total purchase consideration was USD 9.6 billion. The purchase price allocation resulted in net identifiable assets of approximately USD 7.1 billion, consisting of USD 8.5 billion intangible assets, USD 1.4 billion net deferred tax liabilities and goodwill of approx - imately USD 2.5 billion. The 2020 results of operations since the date of acquisition were not material. Sandoz - acquisition of the Japanese business of Aspen Global Incorporated On November 11, 2019, Sandoz entered into an agree - ment for the acquisition of the Japanese business of Aspen Global Incorporated (AGI), a wholly owned sub - sidiary of Aspen Pharmacare Holdings Limited. Under the agreement, Sandoz acquired the shares in Aspen Japan K.K. and associated assets held by AGI. The trans - action closed on January 31, 2020. Aspen's portfolio in Japan consisted of off-patent medicines with a focus on anesthetics and specialty brands. The acquisition will enable Sandoz to expand its presence in the third-largest worldwide generics mar - ketplace. The purchase price consisted of EUR 274 million (USD 303 million) upfront payment, less customary pur - chase price adjustment of EUR 27 million (USD 30 mil- lion), plus potential milestone payments of up to EUR 70 million (USD 77 million), which AGI is eligible to receive upon the achievement of specified milestones. The fair value of the total purchase consideration was EUR 294 million (USD 324 million). The amount consisted of a cash payment of EUR 247 million (USD 273 million) and the fair value of contingent consideration of EUR 47 million (USD 51 million), which AGI is eligible to receive upon the achievement of specified milestones. The pur - chase price allocation resulted in net identifiable assets of USD 238 million, consisting of USD 196 million intan - gible assets, USD 26 million other net assets and USD 16 million net deferred tax assets. Goodwill amounted to USD 86 million. The 2020 results of operations since the date of acquisition were not material. Sandoz - retention of US dermatology business and generic US oral solids portfolio, previously planned to be divested On September 6, 2018, Novartis announced that it entered into a stock and asset purchase agreement (SAPA) with Aurobindo Pharma USA Inc. (Aurobindo) for the sale of selected portions of its Sandoz US portfolio, specifically the Sandoz US dermatology business and generic US oral solids portfolio, for USD 0.8 billion in cash and potential earnouts. The closing was conditional on obtaining regulatory approval. In March 2020, Novartis took the decision to retain the Sandoz US generic oral solids and dermatology busi - nesses and on April 2, 2020 entered into a mutual agree - ment with Aurobindo to terminate the transaction. The Notes to the Novartis Group consolidated financial statements F-17decision was taken as approval from the US Federal Trade Commission for the transaction was not obtained within the agreed timelines. The cumulative amount of the depreciation on prop - erty, plant and equipment (USD 38 million) and amorti - zation on intangible assets (USD 102 million) not recorded in the consolidated income statement since the date of classification as held for sale was recognized in the con - solidated income statement in the first quarter of 2020. In addition, an impairment of currently marketed prod - ucts of USD 42 million was recognized in the first quar - ter of 2020 consolidated income statement. As at March 31, 2020, the assets and liabilities of the Sandoz US generic oral solids and dermatology busi - nesses were reclassified out of assets and liabilities of disposal group held for sale. The prior year balance sheet was not required to be restated. There were no cumulative income or expenses included in the other comprehensive income relating to the disposal group. Significant transactions in 2019 Completion of the spin-off of the Alcon business through a dividend in kind distribution to Novartis AG shareholders On June 29, 2018, Novartis announced its intention to seek shareholder approval for the spin-off of the Alcon business into a separately traded standalone company, following the complete structural separation of the Alcon business into a standalone company (the Alcon business or Alcon Inc.). The Novartis AG shareholders approved the spin-off of the Alcon business at the 2019 Annual General Meet - ing held on February 28, 2019, subject to completion of certain conditions precedent to the distribution. Upon shareholder approval, the Alcon business was reported as discontinued operations, and the fair value of the Alcon business exceeded the carrying value of its net assets. The conditions precedent to the spin-off were met and on April 8, 2019 the spin-off of the Alcon business was effected by way of a distribution of a dividend in kind of Alcon Inc. shares to Novartis AG shareholders and ADR (American Depositary Receipt) holders (\"the Dis - tribution\"), which amounted to USD 23.4 billion and was recognized as a reduction to retained earnings. Through the Distribution, each Novartis AG shareholder received one Alcon Inc. share for every five Novartis AG shares/ADRs they held on April 8, 2019, close of business. As of April 9, 2019, the shares of Alcon Inc. are listed on the SIX Swiss Exchange (SIX) and on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) under the symbol \"ALC.\" The dividend in kind distribution liability to effect the spin-off of the Alcon business (\"the distribution liability\") amounted to USD 26.4 billion at March 31, 2019, unchanged from its initial recognition on February 28, 2019, and was in excess of the carrying value of the Alcon business net assets as of February 28, 2019, and as of March 31, 2019. The net assets of the Alcon business amounted to USD 23.1 billion as at March 31, 2019. On March 6, 2019, Alcon entered into financing arrangements with a syndicate of banks under which it borrowed on April 2, 2019, a total amount of USD 3.2 bil- lion. These borrowings consisted of approximately USD 2.8 billion and the equivalent of USD 0.4 billion in EUR in bridge and other term loans under such Alcon facilities agreement. In addition, approximately USD 0.3 billion of borrowings under a number of local bilateral facilities in different countries, with the largest share of borrowings in Japan, were raised. This resulted in a total gross debt of USD 3.5 billion. These outstanding borrowings of the Alcon legal entities were recorded in the balance sheet and financing cash flow from discontinued operations. Prior to the spin-off, through a series of intercompany transactions, Alcon legal entities paid approximately USD 3.1 billion in cash to Novartis and its affiliates. At the April 8, 2019 Distribution, the fair value of the distribution liability of the Alcon business amounted to USD 23.4 billion, a decrease of USD 3.0 billion from March 31, 2019. As mentioned above, prior to the spin- off, through a series of intercompany transactions, Alcon legal entities incurred additional net financial debt and paid approximately USD 3.1 billion in cash to Novartis and its affiliates. This additional net debt and transactions resulted in a decrease in Alcon's net assets to USD 20.0 billion at the date of the Distribution of the dividend in kind to Novartis AG shareholders on April 8, 2019. The distribution liability at April 8, 2019, remained in excess of the then-carrying value of the Alcon business net assets. Certain consolidated foundations own Novartis AG dividend-bearing shares restricting their availability for use by the Group. These Novartis AG shares are accounted for as treasury shares. Through the Distribu - tion, these foundations received Alcon Inc. shares rep - resenting an approximate 4.7% equity interest in Alcon Inc. Upon the loss of control of Alcon Inc. through the Distribution, the financial investment in Alcon Inc. was recognized at its fair value based on the opening traded share price of Alcon Inc. on April 9, 2019 (a Level 1 hier - archy valuation). At initial recognition, its fair value of USD 1.3 billion was reported on the Group's consolidated bal - ance sheet as a financial asset. Management has des - ignated this investment at fair value through other com - prehensive income. The total non-taxable, non-cash gain recognized at the distribution date of the spin-off of the Alcon business amounted to USD 4.7 billion consisting of: April 8, (USD millions) 2019 Net assets derecognized - 20025 Derecognition of distribution liability 23434 Difference between net assets and distribution liability 3409 Recognition of Alcon Inc. shares obtained through consolidated foundations 1273 Currency translation gains recycled into the consolidated income statement 123 Transaction costs recognized in the consolidated income statement - 114 Gain on distribution of Alcon Inc. to Novartis AG shareholders 4691 For additional disclosures on discontinued operations, refer to Note 30.Notes to the Novartis Group consolidated financial statements F-18Innovative Medicines - acquisition of IFM Tre, Inc. On May 7, 2019, Novartis acquired IFM Tre, Inc., a pri - vately held, US-based biopharmaceutical company focused on developing anti-inflammatory medicines tar - geting the NLRP3 inflammasome. The acquisition gave Novartis full rights to IFM Tre, Inc.'s portfolio of NLRP3 antagonists. The NLRP3 antagonists portfolio consisted of one clinical program and two preclinical programs: IFM-2427, a first-in-class, clinical-stage systemic antag - onist for an array of chronic inflammatory disorders, including atherosclerosis and nonalcoholic steatohepa - titis (NASH); a preclinical-stage gut-directed molecule for the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease; and a preclinical-stage central nervous system (CNS)-pene - trant molecule. The previously held interest of 9% was adjusted to its fair value of USD 33 million through the consolidated income statement at acquisition date. This remeasure - ment resulted in a gain of USD 14 million. The fair value of the total purchase consideration for acquiring the 91% stake Novartis did not already own amounted to USD 361 million. The amount consisted of an initial cash payment of USD 285 million, and the fair value of the contingent consideration of USD 76 million due to the IFM Tre, Inc. shareholders, which they are eligible to receive upon the achievement of specified development and commercial - ization milestones. The purchase price allocation resulted in net identifiable assets of USD 355 million, mainly intan - gible assets, and goodwill of USD 39 million. The 2019 results of operations since the date of acquisition were not material.Innovative Medicines - acquisition of Xiidra On May 8, 2019, Novartis entered into an agreement with Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited (Takeda) to acquire the assets associated with Xiidra (lifitegrast oph - thalmic solution) 5% worldwide. Xiidra is the first and only prescription treatment approved to treat both signs and symptoms of dry eye by inhibiting inflammation caused by the disease. The transaction bolstered the Novartis front-of-the-eye portfolio and ophthalmic leadership. The transaction closed on July 1, 2019. The purchase price consisted of a USD 3.4 billion upfront payment, customary purchase price adjustments of USD 0.1 bil- lion, and the potential milestone payments of up to USD 1.9 billion, which Takeda is eligible to receive upon the achievement of specified commercialization milestones. The fair value of the total purchase consideration was USD 3.7 billion. The amount consisted of an initial cash payment of USD 3.5 billion, and the fair value of the con - tingent consideration of USD 0.2 billion, which Takeda is eligible to receive upon the achievement of specified commercialization milestones. The purchase price allocation resulted in net identi - fiable assets of approximately USD 3.6 billion, consist - ing mainly of intangible assets of USD 3.6 billion, and goodwill amounted to approximately USD 0.1 billion. In 2019, from the date of acquisition, the business gener - ated net sales of USD 0.2 billion. Management estimated that net sales for the entire year of 2019 would have amounted to USD 0.3 billion, had the business been acquired at the beginning of the 2019 reporting period. The 2019 results of operations since the date of acquisition were not material. 3. Segmentation of key figures 2021, 2020 and 2019 The businesses of Novartis are divided operationally on a worldwide basis into two identified reporting segments: Innovative Medicines and Sandoz. In addition, we sepa - rately report Corporate activities. Reporting segments are presented in a manner con - sistent with the internal reporting to the chief operating decision-maker, which is the Executive Committee of Novartis. The reporting segments are managed sepa - rately because they each research, develop, manufac - ture, distribute and sell distinct products that require dif - fering marketing strategies. The Executive Committee of Novartis is responsible for allocating resources and assessing the performance of the reporting segments. The reporting segments are as follows: Innovative Medicines researches, develops, manu - factures, distributes and sells patented prescription medicines. The Innovative Medicines Division is orga - nized into two global business units: Novartis Pharmaceuticals. Novartis Oncology con - sists of the global business franchises Hematology and Solid Tumor, and Novartis Pharmaceuticals consists of the global business franchises Immunology, Hepatology and Dermatology; Neuroscience; Ophthalmology; Car - diovascular, Renal and Metabolism; Respiratory and Allergy; and Established Medicines. Sandoz develops, manufactures and markets finished dosage form medicines as well as intermediary products including active pharmaceutical ingredients. Sandoz is organized globally into three franchises: Retail Generics, Anti-Infectives and Biopharmaceuticals. In Retail Gener - ics, Sandoz develops, manufactures and markets active ingredients and finished dosage forms of small molecule pharmaceuticals to third parties across a broad range of therapeutic areas, as well as finished dosage form of anti-infectives sold to third parties. In Anti-Infectives, Sandoz manufactures and supplies active pharmaceuti - cal ingredients and intermediates, mainly antibiotics, for internal use by Retail Generics and for sale to third-party customers. In Biopharmaceuticals, Sandoz develops, manufactures and markets protein- or other biotechnol - ogy-based products, including biosimilars, and provides biotechnology manufacturing services to other compa - nies. Income and expenses relating to Corporate include the costs of the Group headquarters and those of cor -Notes to the Novartis Group consolidated financial statements F-19porate coordination functions in major countries. In addi - tion, Corporate includes other items of income and expense that are not attributable to specific segments, such as certain revenues from intellectual property rights, certain expenses related to post-employment benefits, environmental remediation liabilities, charitable activities, donations and sponsorships. Usually, no allo - cation of Corporate items is made to the segments. As a result, Corporate assets and liabilities principally con - sist of net debt (cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities less financial debts), investments in associ - ated companies, and current and deferred taxes and non-segment-specific environmental remediation and post-employment benefit liabilities. Our divisions are supported by the Novartis Institutes for BioMedical Research, Global Drug Development, Novartis Technical Operations and Customer & Technol - ogy Solutions (formerly named Novartis Business Ser - vices). The Novartis Institutes for BioMedical Research (NIBR) conducts research activities for the Innovative Medicines Division and also collaborates with Sandoz. The Global Drug Development organization oversees all drug development activities for our Innovative Medicines Division and collaborates with our Sandoz Division on the development of its biosimilars portfo - lio. The Novartis Technical Operations organization man - ages our manufacturing operations across our Innovative Medicines and Sandoz Divisions. Customer & Technology Solutions (CTS), formerly named Novartis Business Services, is our shared ser - vices organization that delivers business support ser -vices across the Group, such as information technol - ogy, real estate and facility services, procurement, product lifecycle services, talent and people solutions, financial reporting and accounting operations, and communication and engagement. Following the February 28, 2019, shareholders' approval of the spin-off of the Alcon business (refer to Notes 1, 2 and 30 for further details), the Group reported its con - solidated financial statements as \"continuing operations\" and \"discontinued operations.\" Continuing operations comprise the activities of the Innovative Medicines and Sandoz Divisions, and the con - tinuing Corporate activities. Discontinued operations included the operational results from the Alcon eye care devices business and certain corporate activities attributable to the Alcon busi - ness prior to the spin-off, the gain on distribution of Alcon Inc. to Novartis AG shareholders, and certain other expenses related to the Distribution (refer to Notes 1, 2 and 30 for further details). The accounting policies mentioned in Note 1 are used in the reporting of segment results. Inter-segmental sales are made at amounts that are considered to approximate arm's length transactions. The Executive Committee of Novartis evaluates segmental performance and allo - cates resources among the segments based on a num - ber of measures, including net sales, operating income and net operating assets. Segment net operating assets consist primarily of property, plant and equipment; right- of-use assets; intangible assets; goodwill; inventories; and trade and other operating receivables less operat - ing liabilities.Notes to the Novartis Group consolidated financial statements F-20Segmentation - consolidated income statements Innovative Medicines Sandoz Corporate Group (including eliminations) (USD millions) 2021 2020 2021 2020 2021 2020 2021 41995 39013 9631 9646 51626 48659 Sales to other segments 795 792 180 189 -

No Novartis share of other comprehensive income recognized by associated companies was recycled to the consolidated income statement in 2020 and 2019. Novartis has certain non-significant investments and had a significant investment in Roche Holding AG, Basel (Roche), which was divested on December 6, 2021, to Roche, that are accounted for as associated companies. Balance sheet value December 31, December 31, (USD millions) 2021 2020 Roche Holding AG, Switzerland 9407 Others 205 225 Total 205 9632 Roche Holding AG On November 3, 2021, Novartis entered into an agree - ment with Roche Holding AG to divest its 33.3% of Roche Holding AG (Roche) voting shares, representing approx - imately 6.2% of Roche's total outstanding voting and non-voting equity instruments, to Roche for USD 20.7 billion in cash. As a result, Novartis discontinued the use of equity method accounting starting from November 3, 2021.The divestment transaction closed on December 6, 2021, and Novartis realized a gain of USD 14.6 billion, recorded in income from associated companies. See Note 2. The Group's holding in Roche voting shares was 33.3% at December 31, 2020 and 2019. This investment represented approximately 6.2% of Roche's total out - standing voting and non-voting equity instruments at December 31, 2020 and 2019. Since full-year financial data for Roche is not avail - able when Novartis produces its consolidated financial results, a survey of analyst estimates is used to estimate the Group's share of Roche's net income. Any differences between these estimates and actual results were adjusted in the Group's consolidated financial state - ments when available. As Novartis discontinued the use of equity method accounting starting from November 3, 2021, and the divestment closed on December 6, 2021, no such adjustment will be made to the 2022 Group's consolidated financial statements.

Current and deferred income tax expense The significant components of the provision for income taxes are as follows: (USD millions) 2021 2020 2019 Switzerland - 958 - 932 - 1186 Foreign - 1470 - 1168 - 961 Current income tax expense - 2428 - 2100 - 2147 Switzerland 23 - 137 - 93 Foreign 286 430 447 Deferred tax income 309 293 354 Income tax expense from continuing operations - 2119 - 1807 - 1793 Analysis of tax rate Novartis has a substantial business presence in many countries and is therefore subject to different income and expense items that are non-taxable (permanent dif - ferences) or are taxed at different rates in those tax juris - dictions. This results in a difference between our appli - cable tax rate and effective tax rate. The main elements contributing to the difference between the Group's overall applicable tax rate (which can change each year since it is calculated as the weighted average tax rate based on the pre-tax income of each subsidiary) and the effective tax rate are shown in the following table: (As a percentage) 2021 2020 2019 Applicable tax rate 14.8 13.6 11.7 Effect of disallowed expenditures 1.0 4.6 4.8 Effect of utilization of tax losses brought forward from prior periods 0.0 - 0.3 - 0.1 Effect of income taxed at reduced rates - 0.1 - 0.3 - 0.7 Effect of income not subject to tax 1 - 7.5 - 0.7 0.0 Effect of tax credits and allowances - 1.4 - 2.3 - 2.3 Effect of release of contingent consideration liability - 0.1 - 0.2 - 0.5 Effect of tax rate change on current and deferred tax assets and liabilities 2 0.0 0.3 - 1.4 Effect of write-off of deferred tax assets 3 0.0 0.2 4.0 Effect of write-down and reversal of write-down of investments in subsidiaries 0.0 - 0.8 - 0.6 Effect of prior-year items 0.1 2.3 2.2 Effect of other items 4 1.3 1.9 3.0 Effective tax rate for continuing operations 8.1 18.3 20.1 1 2021 includes the effect of income not subject to tax ( - 7.3%) arising from the non-taxable gain on the divestment of our investment in Roche. See Notes 2 and 4 for further details. 2 2019 is mainly related to the revaluation of the deferred tax assets and liabilities resulting from the tax reforms enacted in Switzerland in 2019. Refer to Note 12 for additional disclosures. 3 2019 is primarily related to a non-cash, one-time deferred tax expense for the write-off of a deferred tax asset resulting from legal entity reorganizations. 4 In 2021, other items include changes in uncertain tax positions (+ 1.3%). In 2020, other items (+ 1.9%) include changes in uncertain tax positions (+ 2.0%) and other items ( -0.1%). In 2019, other items (+ 3.0%) include changes in uncertain tax positions (+ 2.6%) and other items (+ 0.4%). The utilization of tax-loss carry-forwards lowered the tax charge by USD 5 million in 2021, by USD 29 million in 2020, and by USD 11 million in 2019. For the amount of income taxes attributable to dis - continued operations, see Note 30.Notes to the Novartis Group consolidated financial statements F-31 7.

This calculation excludes the aver - age number of issued shares purchased by the Group and held as treasury shares. For diluted EPS, the weighted average number of shares outstanding is adjusted to assume the vesting of all restricted shares, restricted share units, and the conversion of all potentially dilutive shares arising from options on Novartis shares that have been issued. No options were excluded from the calculation of diluted EPS in 2021, 2020 or 2019, as all options were dilutive in all years.Notes to the Novartis Group consolidated financial statements F-32 8.

The Group's most material lease with a lease term extension, representing a lease liability value of USD 0.6 billion (2020: USD 0.6 billion), has a determined lease term end date of 2071 (2020: 2071). Non-enforceable extension options of up to 10 years have not been included within the measurement of this lease liability, and do not have a material impact to the carrying value of the lease for both 2021 and 2020. Should the landlord agree to a lease extension, rent will be referenced to the market rates as at the commencement of the extension period. There were no significant sale and leaseback transactions in 2021 or 2020. In 2019, the Group completed sale and leaseback transactions for certain property, plant and equipment as part of its plans to consolidate sites. Transactions resulted in net cash inflows of USD 0.7 billion and the recognition of USD 96 million of lease liabilities, and USD 37 million of right-of-use assets. The right-of-use assets value reflects the proportion of the property, plant and equipment retained for a period of one to five years, with two five-year extension periods for certain right-of-use assets. The liabilities reflect the net present value of future lease payments. The net gain on the sale and leaseback transactions amounted to USD 478 million. The following table provides additional disclosures related to right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for 2021, 2020 and 2019: (USD millions) 2021 2020 2019 Interest expense on lease liabilities 1 62 67 66 Expense on short-term leases 6 4 7 Expense on low-value leases 7 7 8 Total cash outflows for leases 381 379 339 Thereof: Cash outflows for short-term leases and low-value leases 2 13 11 15 Payments of interest 3 52 56 51 Payments of lease liabilities 4 316 312 273 1 The weighted average interest rate is 3.2 % (2020: 3.4 %, 2019: 3.9 %). 2 Cash flows from short-term and low-value leases are included within total net cash flows from operating activities. The portfolio of short-term leases to which the Group is committed to at December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, is similar to the portfolio of short-term leases the Group entered into during 2021, 2020 and 2019. 3 Included within total net cash flows from operating activities 4 Reported as cash outflows used in financing activities net of lease incentives received of USD nil (2020: nil , 2019: USD 33 million)Notes to the Novartis Group consolidated financial statements F-36The net investment held and income from subleasing right-of-use assets were not significant for 2021 and 2020. Income from leasing Novartis property, plant and equipment to third parties for both 2021 and 2020 was not significant. 11.

The valuation method of the recoverable amount of the cash-generating units, to which goodwill is allocated, is based on the fair value less costs of disposal. The following assumptions are used in the calcula - tions: Innovative (As a percentage) Medicines Sandoz Terminal growth rate 1.5 1.5 Discount rate (post-tax) 6.5 6.5 The discount rates for all divisions consider the Group's weighted average cost of capital, adjusted to approxi -mate the weighted average cost of capital of a compa - rable market participant. The fair value less costs of disposal, for all cash-gen - erating units containing goodwill, is reviewed for the impact of reasonably possible changes in key assump - tions. In particular, we considered an increase in the dis - count rate, a decrease in the terminal growth rate, and certain negative impacts on the forecasted cash flows. These reasonably possible changes in key assumptions did not indicate an impairment. \"Note 1.

The net deferred tax balance at December 31, 2020 did not require adjustment (see the paragraphs below in this Note 12 for additional disclosures). Notes to the Novartis Group consolidated financial statements F-40 The December 31, 2020, presentation of deferred tax liabilities and deferred tax assets on the consolidated balance sheet has been adjusted. This adjustment was made to conform with the December 31, 2021, presen - tation to offset all deferred tax liabilities and deferred tax assets within the same tax jurisdiction and when a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets against current tax liabilities exists. In the December 31, 2020, consolidated balance sheet, deferred tax liabilities and deferred tax assets were presented on gross basis and not fully netted as required for presentation in the consolidated balance sheet, because only certain portions of deferred tax amounts were offset. The correction resulted in a decrease in the previ - ously reported December 31, 2020, deferred tax liabili - ties, total non-current liabilities, total liabilities, and total equity and liabilities by USD 4.3 billion and a correspond - ing USD 4.3 billion decrease in deferred tax assets, total non-current assets, and total assets. The correction resulted only in the net presentation of these deferred tax amounts in the consolidated balance sheet, with no impact to the consolidated income statement, statement of comprehensive income, statement of changes in equity and statement of cash flows, and management concluded the item was not material to the previously issued consolidated financial statements. Deferred tax liabilities have not been recognized for the withholding tax and other taxes that would be payable on the remittance of earnings of foreign subsidiaries, as the Group has the ability to control any future reversal and the unremitted earnings are retained in the foreign subsidiaries for reinvestment. The total unremitted earn - ings retained for reinvestment in the Group's foreign sub - sidiaries that would be subject to withholding tax or other taxes if remitted to the Group are estimated at approxi - mately USD 29 billion in 2021 (2020: USD 27 billion). The gross value of tax-loss carry-forwards that have or have not been capitalized as deferred tax assets, with their expiry dates, is as follows: (USD millions) Not capitalized Capitalized 2021 total One year 15 4 19 Two years 14 6 20 Three years 37 10 47 Four years 26 11 37 Five years 146 20 166 More than five years 3536 1872 5408 Not subject to expiry 418 684 1102 Total 4192 2607 6799 (USD millions) Not capitalized Capitalized 2020 total One year 20 20 Two years 1 5 6 Three years 2 6 8 Four years 23 23 Five years 11 40 51 More than five years 1 3400 2291 5691 Not subject to expiry 323 683 1006 Tot al 3780 3025 6805 1 Not capitalized more than five years includes USD 3.2 billion attributable to US state tax-loss carry-forwards, of which USD 1.6 billion relates to The Medicines Company, which was acquired in 2020 (see Note 2).

The Basel-Stadt cantonal tax reform was approved by voters in February 2019, with parts of the reform retro - actively enacted per January 1, 2019. The newly enacted tax rate resulted in a decrease of the blended cantonal and federal tax rate from 22% to 13% . This change impacted the Group's Basel-Stadt-domiciled operating subsidiaries. The Swiss federal tax reform was approved by vot - ers in May 2019. The enactment of the Swiss federal tax reform required the abolishment of the holding company tax regimes as of January 1, 2020. As a result, the hold - ing company tax rate increased from the current 8% to 13%, effective January 1, 2020. The enactment of these Swiss tax reforms required a revaluation of the deferred tax assets and liabilities to the newly enacted tax rates at the date of enactment. The following table shows the impact on the revalu - ation of deferred assets and liabilities in 2019, as at the respective dates of the enactment of the Swiss tax reforms: Income statement continuing (USD millions) operations Equity To t a l Deferred tax asset and liability revaluation Items previously recognized in consolidated income statement 234 234 Items previously recognized in other comprehensive income 1 - 358 - 358 Total revaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities 234 - 358 - 124 1 Related to post-employment benefitsNotes to the Novartis Group consolidated financial statements F-4113.

Novartis continues to monitor sovereign debt issues and eco - nomic conditions in the countries in which it operates, particularly in Argentina, Brazil, Greece, Italy, Portugal, Russia, Spain and Turkey, and evaluates trade receiv - ables in these countries for potential collection risks. The majority of the outstanding trade receivables from Por - tugal, Spain and Greece are due directly from local gov - ernments or from government-funded entities. Deterio - rating credit and economic conditions as well as other factors in these closely monitored countries have resulted in, and may continue to result in, an increase in the average length of time that it takes to collect these trade receivables, and may require the Group to re-eval - uate the expected credit loss amount of these trade receivables in future periods. The following table shows the gross trade receiv - ables balance from these closely monitored countries at December 31, 2021 and 2020; the amounts that are past due for more than one year; and the related provisions for doubtful trade receivables that have been recorded: (USD millions) 2021 2020 Total balance of gross trade receivables from closely monitored countries 1336 1505 Past due for more than one year 27 55 Provisions for doubtful trade receivables 24 27 At December 31, 2021, amounts past due for more than one year are not significant in any of these countries on a standalone basis.

The value for the shares and options granted is credited to consolidated equity over the respective vesting period. In addition, tax benefits arising from tax-deductible amounts exceeding the expense recognized in the income statement are credited to equity. 18.3) In December 2021, Novartis entered into an irrevo - cable, non-discretionary arrangement with a bank to repurchase Novartis shares on the second trading line under its up-to USD 15.0 billion share buyback. Novartis is able to cancel this arrangement at any time but could be subject to a 90-day waiting period. The commitment under this arrangement therefore reflects the obligated purchases by the bank under such trading plan over a rolling 90-day period, or if shorter, until the maturity date of such trading plan. The liability under this arrangement amounted to USD 2.8 billion as of December 31, 2021.Notes to the Novartis Group consolidated financial statements F-45In June 2021, Novartis entered into an irrevocable, non-discretionary arrangement with a bank to repur - chase Novartis shares to mitigate dilution related to par - ticipation plans of employees. Novartis would have been able to cancel this arrangement at any time but would have been subject to a 90-day waiting period. This trading plan commitment was fully executed and expired in June 2021, and as a consequence, there is no liability related to this plan recognized as of December 31, 2021. In November 2020, Novartis entered into an irrevo - cable, non-discretionary arrangement with a bank to repurchase Novartis shares on the second trading line under its up-to USD 2.5 billion share buyback. Novartis would have been able to cancel this arrangement at any time, but would have been subject to a 90-day waiting period. The commitment under this arrangement there - fore reflected the obligated purchases by the bank under such trading plan over a rolling 90-day period, or if shorter, until the maturity date of such trading plan. The commitment under this arrangement amounted to USD 1.8 billion as of December 31, 2020. This trading plan commitment was fully executed and expired in March 2021, and as a consequence, there is no liability related to this plan recognized as of December 31, 2021. In August 2020, Novartis entered into an irrevocable, non-discretionary arrangement with a bank to repur - chase Novartis shares to mitigate dilution related to par - ticipation plans of employees. Novartis would have been able to cancel this arrangement at any time but would have been subjected to a 90-day waiting period. This trading plan commitment was fully executed and expired, and as a consequence, there is no liability related to this plan recognized as of December 31, 2020. In 2019, Novartis entered into a similar irrevocable, non-discretionary arrangement with a bank to repur - chase Novartis shares on the second trading line under its up-to USD 5 billion share buyback and to repurchase Novartis shares to mitigate dilution related to participa - tion plans of employees. The commitment under this arrangement therefore reflects the obligated purchases by the bank under such trading plan over a rolling 90-day period, or if shorter, until the maturity date of such trad - ing plan. The trading plan commitment was fully executed and expired, and as a consequence, there is no liability related to this plan recognized as of December 31, 2019.18.4) In October 2020, Novartis entered into an agree - ment with the market maker for its employee options to repurchase a portion of the outstanding written call options. A total of 3.7 million options were repurchased under this agreement. This agreement was terminated in November 2020. 18.5) The impact of change in ownership of consolidated entities represents the excess of the amount paid to non-controlling interest over their carrying value and equity allocation to non-controlling interest due to change in ownership percentage. 18.6) Changes in non-controlling interests represent the impact on the non-controlling interest of transactions with minority shareholders, such as change in ownership percentage, dividend payments and other equity trans - actions. 18.7) Other movements include, for subsidiaries in hyper - inflationary economies, the impact of the restatement of the non-monetary assets and liabilities with the general price index at the beginning of the period as well as the restatement of the equity balances of the current year. See Note 29 for additional disclosures. 18.8) Transaction costs that were directly attributable to the distribution (spin-off) of Alcon Inc. to Novartis AG shareholders and that would otherwise have been avoided, were recorded to equity, see Note 1 for further details. 18.9) At December 31, 2021, the market maker held 3 mil - lion (2020: 1 million; 2019: 13 million) written call options, originally issued as part of the share-based compensa - tion for employees, that have not yet been exercised. The weighted average exercise price of these options is USD 61.45 (2020: USD 60.09 ; 2019: USD 63.90 ), and they have contractual lives of 10 years, with remaining lives up to two years (2020: three years; 2019: four years). In December 2018, Novartis entered into an agree - ment with the market maker for its employee options to repurchase a portion of the outstanding written call options that are not exercised in exchange for treasury shares. During 2019, this agreement was fully executed.Notes to the Novartis Group consolidated financial statements F-46 19.

Novartis believes that its total provisions are adequate based upon currently available information. However, given the inherent difficulties in estimating liabilities in this area, Novartis may incur additional costs beyond the amounts provided. Management believes that such addi - tional amounts, if any, would not be material to the Group's financial condition but could be material to the results of operations or cash flows in a given period.Notes to the Novartis Group consolidated financial statements F-48 Environmental remediation provisions The following table shows the movements in the envi - ronmental liability provisions: (USD millions) 2021 2020 2019 January 1 809 714 692 Cash payments - 169 - 10 - 30 Releases - 105 - 27 - 83 Additions 105 82 124 Currency translation effects - 24 50 11 December 31 616 809 714 Less current provision - 49 - 167 - 122 Non-current environmental remediation provisions at December 31 567 642 592 The material components of the environmental remedi - ation provisions consist of costs to sufficiently clean and refurbish contaminated sites to the extent necessary and to continue surveillance at sites where the environmen - tal remediation exposure is less significant. A substantial portion of the environmental remedia - tion provisions relate to the remediation of Basel regional landfills in the adjacent border areas in Switzerland, Ger - many and France. The provisions are reassessed on a yearly basis and adjusted as necessary. In the United States, Novartis has been named under federal legislation (the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, as amended) as a potentially responsible party (PRP) in respect of certain sites. Novartis actively participates in, or monitors, the cleanup activities at the sites in which it is a PRP. The provision takes into consideration the num - ber of other PRPs at each site as well as the identity and financial position of such parties in light of the joint and several nature of the liability. The expected timing of the related cash outflows as of December 31, 2021, is currently projected as follows: Expected (USD millions) cash outflows Due within two years 94 Due later than two years, but within five years 199 Due later than five years, but within 10 years 275 Due after 10 years 48 Total environmental remediation liability provisions 616 Provisions for product liabilities, governmental investigations and other legal matters Novartis has established provisions for certain product liabilities, governmental investigations and other legal matters where a potential cash outflow is probable and Novartis can make a reliable estimate of the amount of the outflow. These provisions represent the Group's cur - rent best estimate of the total financial effect for the mat - ters described below and for other less significant mat -ters. Potential cash outflows reflected in a provision might be fully or partially offset by insurance in certain circumstances. Novartis has not established provisions for potential damage awards for certain additional legal claims against its subsidiaries if Novartis currently believes that a pay- ment is either not probable or cannot be reliably esti - mated. In total, these not-provisioned-for matters include more than 3 000 individual product liability cases and certain other legal matters. Plaintiffs' alleged claims in these matters, which Novartis does not believe to be entirely remote but which do not fulfill the conditions for the establishment of provisions, currently aggregate to, according to the current best belief of Novartis, approx - imately USD 0.5 billion. In addition, in some of these mat - ters there are claims for punitive or multiple (treble) dam - ages, civil penalties and disgorgement of profits that in the view of Novartis are either wholly or partially unspec - ified, or wholly or partially unquantifiable at present; the Group believes that information about these amounts claimed by plaintiffs generally is not meaningful for pur - poses of determining a reliable estimate of a loss that is probable or more than remote. A number of other legal matters are in such early stages or the issues presented are such that the Group has not made any provisions since it cannot currently estimate either a potential outcome or the amount of any potential losses. For these reasons, among others, the Group generally is unable to make a reliable estimate of possible loss with respect to such cases. It is therefore not practicable to provide information about the poten - tial financial impact of those cases. There might also be cases for which the Group was able to make a reliable estimate of the possible loss or the range of possible loss, but the Group believes that publication of such information on a case-by-case basis would seriously prejudice the Group's position in ongo - ing legal proceedings or in any related settlement dis - cussions. Accordingly, in such cases, information has been disclosed with respect to the nature of the contin - gency, but no disclosure is provided as to an estimate of the possible loss or range of possible loss. Note 28 contains additional information on contin - gencies. Summary of significant legal proceedings The following is a summary of significant legal proceed - ings to which Novartis or its subsidiaries are currently a party, or were a party and that concluded in 2021. Investigations and related litigations Southern District of New York (S.D.N.Y.) Gilenya marketing practices investigation and litigation In 2013, Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation (NPC) received a civil investigative demand from the United States Attorney's Office (USAO) for the S.D.N.Y. request - ing the production of documents and information relat - ing to marketing practices for Gilenya , including the remuneration of healthcare providers in connection therewith. In 2017, the S.D.N.Y. and New York State declined to intervene in claims raised by an individual Notes to the Novartis Group consolidated financial statements F-49relator in a qui tam complaint, which continue to be vig - orously contested. Government generic pricing antitrust investigations, antitrust class actions Since 2016, Sandoz Inc. has received a grand jury sub - poena and a civil investigative demand and interrogato - ries from the Antitrust and Civil Divisions of the US Department of Justice (DOJ), and a subpoena and inter - rogatories from the Attorney General of the State of Con - necticut in connection with those agencies' investiga - tions into alleged price fixing and market allocation of generic drugs in the United States as well as alleged fed - eral False Claims Act (FCA) violations. In 2020, Sandoz Inc. reached a resolution with the DOJ Antitrust Division, pursuant to which Sandoz Inc. paid USD 195 million and entered into a deferred prosecution agreement. The Sandoz Inc. resolution related to instances of miscon - duct at the company between 2013 and 2015 with regard to certain generic drugs sold in the United States. Under the terms of that agreement, Sandoz Inc. will continue to take steps to enhance its compliance program, employee training and monitoring, and will continue to cooperate with the US government's ongoing investiga - tion into the generic pharmaceutical industry. Sandoz Inc. also finalized a resolution with the DOJ Civil Division and in 2021 paid USD 185 million plus interest from the date of the agreement in principle, to settle related claims arising under the FCA, and entered into a corporate integrity agreement with the Office of Inspector General (OIG) of the US Department of Health and Human Ser - vices (HHS). This resolution with the DOJ resolves all federal government matters related to price fixing alle - gations. Since the third quarter of 2016, Sandoz Inc. and Foug - era Pharmaceuticals Inc. have been sued alongside other generic pharmaceutical companies in numerous individ - ual and putative class action complaints by direct and indirect private purchasers and by 54 US states and ter - ritories, represented by their respective Attorneys Gen - eral. Plaintiffs claim that defendants, including Sandoz Inc., engaged in price fixing and market allocation of generic drugs in the United States, and seek damages and injunctive relief. The litigation includes complaints alleging product-specific conspiracies, as well as com - plaints alleging the existence of an overarching industry conspiracy, and assert claims for damages and penal - ties under federal and state antitrust and consumer pro - tection acts. The cases have been consolidated for pre - trial purposes in the United States District Court (USDC) for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, and the claims are being vigorously contested. Lucentis/Avastin\u00ae matters In connection with an investigation into whether Novartis entities, F. Hoffmann-La Roche AG, Genentech Inc. and Roche S.p.A. colluded to artificially preserve the market positions of Avastin\u00ae and Lucentis , in 2014 the Italian Competition Authority (ICA) imposed a fine equivalent to USD 125 million on the Novartis entities. Novartis paid the fine, subject to the right to later claim recoupment, and appealed before the Consiglio di Stato (CdS). In 2014 and 2015, the Italian Ministry of Health and the Lombar - dia region sent letters with payment requests for a total equivalent of approximately USD 1.3 billion in damages from Novartis and Roche entities based on these allega - tions. In 2019, the CdS upheld the ICA decision and fine. Following that CdS decision, several additional Italian regions and hospitals sent letters claiming damages for an aggregate amount of approximately USD 330 million. None of these claims have been asserted in legal pro - ceedings and no further letters have been sent since. Novartis continues to appeal the CdS decision. In 2019, the French Competition Authority (FCA) issued a State - ment of Objections against Novartis entities, alleging anti-competitive practices on the French market for anti-vascular endothelial growth factor treatments for wet age-related macular degeneration from 2008 to 2013. In 2020, the FCA issued a decision finding that the Novartis entities had infringed competition law by abus - ing a dominant position and imposing a fine equivalent to approximately USD 452 million. Novartis paid the fine, again subject to recoupment, and is appealing the FCA's decision. Novartis continues to vigorously contest all claims in Italy and France. Novartis is also challenging policies and regulations allowing off-label/unlicensed use and reimbursement for economic reasons in various countries, including Italy and Turkey. South Korea investigation In 2016, the Seoul Western District Prosecutor initiated a criminal investigation into, among other things, allega - tions that Novartis Korea utilized medical journals to pro - vide inappropriate economic benefits to healthcare pro - fessionals (HCPs). This resulted in a non-material fine, which the prosecutor appealed. In 2021, the appellate court upheld the fine, and the prosecutor has appealed that decision. Greece investigation Novartis is providing information to the Greek authorities investigating allegations of potentially inappropriate eco - nomic benefits to HCPs, government officials and others in Greece. These authorities include the Greek Coordi - nating Body for Inspection and Control, and the Greek Body of Prosecution of Financial Crime (SDOE), from which the Company received a summons in 2018 and 2020. In 2021, SDOE imposed on Novartis Hellas a fine equivalent to approximately USD 1.2 million, which Novartis Hellas has appealed. 340B Drug Pricing Program investigation In 2021, NPC received a civil investigative subpoena from the Office of the Attorney General of the State of Ver - mont. The subpoena requested the production of docu - ments and information concerning NPC's participation in the 340B Drug Pricing Program in Vermont. NPC pro - vided documents and information to the Office of the Attorney General. Also in 2021, NPC received a notifica - tion from the US Health Resources and Services Admin - istration (HRSA) stating that HRSA believes NPC's con - tract pharmacy policy, which was revised in 2020 to establish a geographic limitation on contract pharmacy eligibility, but maintained eligibility for pharmacies located within a 40-mile radius of the parent 340B hos - pital, violates the 340B statute. HRSA also threatened an enforcement action. NPC believes its policy is con - sistent with the 340B program's original intent to sup -Notes to the Novartis Group consolidated financial statements F-50port vulnerable patients. Accordingly, NPC sued HRSA in the USDC for the District of Columbia to challenge HRSA's determination and to enjoin HRSA from taking action with respect to NPC's contract pharmacy policy. HRSA then referred the matter regarding NPC's contract pharmacy policy to OIG, which could result in the impo - sition of civil monetary penalties on NPC. In November 2021, the USDC issued a decision rejecting HRSA's inter - pretation of the 340B statute, vacated the violation noti - fication and remanded the matter to HRSA. HRSA has filed an appeal. Entresto matter In 2021, NPC received a civil investigative demand from the DOJ seeking information from 2016 to the present regarding the marketing and pricing of Entresto , includ - ing remuneration provided to HCPs. NPC is cooperating with the DOJ's inquiry. Antitrust class actions Exforge Since 2018, Novartis Group companies as well as other pharmaceutical companies have been sued by various direct and indirect purchasers of Exforge in multiple US individual and putative class action complaints. They claim that Novartis made a reverse payment in the form of an agreement not to launch an authorized generic, alleging violations of federal antitrust law and state anti - trust, consumer protection and common laws, and seek - ing damages as well as injunctive relief. The cases have been consolidated in the S.D.N.Y. and the claims are being vigorously contested. Product liability litigation Reclast NPC is a defendant in more than 20 US product liability actions involving Reclast and alleging atypical femur fracture injuries, all of which are in New Jersey state or federal court and in California state court, coordinated with claims against other bisphosphonate manufactur - ers. The claims are being vigorously contested. Ta xote re\u00ae (docetaxel) Sandoz is a defendant in more than 3 000 US product liability actions involving Taxotere\u00ae (docetaxel), an oncology product, many of which have been transferred to a multidistrict litigation in the Eastern District of Lou - isiana. The complaints allege misleading marketing and that Sanofi, as innovator, and several 505(b)(2) NDA hold - ers (including Sandoz) failed to warn of the risk of per - manent alopecia/hair loss. The claims are being vigor - ously contested. Amiodarone Sandoz entities are named in more than five individual and multi-plaintiff US product liability cases involving amiodarone, a cardiac drug indicated to treat life-threat - ening arrhythmias that have not responded to other treat - ment. The complaints allege failure to warn, off-label pro -motion, and failure to include medication guides to pharmacies. The claims are being vigorously contested. Sartans and ranitidine Since 2018, claims have been brought against Sandoz and other pharmaceutical companies alleging injury from carcinogenic impurities found in valsartan and valsartan/ HCT film-coated tablets and/or losartan marketed or manufactured by Sandoz. These claims include several putative class actions in Canada. Claims have also been brought alleging injury from carcinogenic impurities in ranitidine-containing medicines. These claims also include several putative class actions in Canada and a multidistrict litigation in Florida. All of these claims are being vigorously contested. T asigna NPC is a defendant in more than 300 US product liabil - ity actions involving Tasigna , alleging that the product caused various cardiovascular effects and that NPC failed to provide adequate warnings about those alleged side effects. State court actions are pending in a multi - county litigation in Bergen County, New Jersey, and fed - eral cases are pending in a multidistrict litigation in the Middle District of Florida. The claims are being vigorously contested. Other matters Average Wholesale Price (AWP) litigation Lawsuits have been brought, the latest in February 2016, by various US state governmental entities and private parties against various pharmaceutical companies, including NPC, alleging that they fraudulently overstated the AWP that is or has been used by payers, including state Medicaid agencies, to calculate reimbursements to healthcare providers. NPC remains a defendant in a putative class action brought by private payers in New Jersey, and vigorously contests those claims. Shareholder derivative lawsuit In 2021, NPC, Sandoz Inc., Novartis Capital Corporation and certain present and former directors and officers of Novartis were named as defendants, and Novartis was named as a nominal defendant, in a purported share - holder derivative lawsuit filed in New York state court. The plaintiffs, derivatively as purported Novartis share - holders on behalf of Novartis, seek damages and other remedies based on alleged conduct by the corporate and individual defendants. The claims are being vigor - ously contested. Concluded legal matters Japan investigation In 2015, a trial started against a former Novartis Pharma K.K. (NPKK) employee, and also against NPKK under the dual liability concept in Japanese law, over allegations brought by the Tokyo District Public Prosecutor Office for alleged manipulation of data in sub-analysis publica - tions of the Kyoto Heart Study regarding valsartan. The Notes to the Novartis Group consolidated financial statements F-51charges against NPKK were subject to a maximum total fine of JPY 4 million. In 2018, the Tokyo High Court upheld a not-guilty ruling of the Tokyo District Court in 2017 for both the former NPKK employee and NPKK, and that rul - ing was appealed to the Supreme Court of Japan. In 2021, the Supreme Court issued its decision dismissing the prosecutors' appeal and upholding the Tokyo Dis - trict Court's not-guilty ruling. This matter is now con - cluded. Aimovig-Amgen dispute In 2015 and 2017, Novartis and Amgen entered into agreements regarding the development and commer - cialization of Aimovig , which the companies co-commer - cialized in the US and to which Novartis has exclusive rights in all territories outside the US, excluding Japan. Amgen issued a termination notice in April 2019 based on an alleged material breach of the collaboration agree - ments, and this notice, as well as other ancillary matters, were the subject of legal proceedings between Novartis and Amgen. Novartis disputed Amgen's allegations vig - orously. In 2020, the court ruled that Amgen did not have grounds to terminate the 2017 agreement and dismissed that portion of their lawsuit. In 2022, the parties reached a confidential agreement to settle all remaining claims in the litigation. Novartis returned its Aimovig US rights to Amgen, which is now exclusively commercializing Aimovig in the US. Novartis will continue to commercial - ize Aimovig in the rest of the world, with the exception of Japan. This matter is now concluded.Summary of product liability, governmental investigations and other legal matters provision movements (USD millions) 2021 2020 2019 January 1 487 1369 340 Provisions related to discontinued operations 1 - 42 Impact of acquisitions of businesses 11 10 Cash payments - 292 - 1863 - 116 Releases of provisions - 44 - 31 - 52 Additions to provisions 251 1018 1230 Currency translation effects - 5 - 17 - 1 December 31 397 487 1369 Less current portion - 56 - 306 - 1169 Non-current product liabilities, governmental investigations and other legal matters provisions at December 31 341 181 200 1 Notes 1, 2 and 30 provide information related to discontinued operations.

The goodwill arising out of these acquisitions is attributable to the buyer-specific syner - gies, the assembled workforce, and the accounting for deferred tax liabilities on the acquired assets. Goodwill of USD 107 million in 2021 (2020: USD 74 million; 2019: USD 98 million) is tax deductible. 25. Post-employment benefits for employees Defined benefit plans In addition to the legally required social security schemes, the Group has numerous independent pension and other post-employment benefit plans. In most cases, these plans are externally funded in entities that are legally separate from the Group. For certain Group companies, however, no independent plan assets exist for the pen - sion and other post-employment benefit obligations of employees. In these cases, the related unfunded liability is included in the balance sheet. The defined benefit obli - gations (DBOs) of all major pension and other post-em - ployment benefit plans are reappraised annually by inde - pendent actuaries. Plan assets are recognized at fair value. The major plans are based in Switzerland, the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany and Japan, which represent 95% of the Group's total DBO for pen - sion plans. Details of the plans in the two most signifi - cant countries, Switzerland and the United States, which represent 80% of the Group's total DBO for post-em - ployment benefit plans, are provided below. Swiss-based pension plans represent the most sig - nificant portion of the Group's total DBO and plan assets. For the active insured members born on or after Janu - ary 1, 1956, or having joined the plans after December 31, 2010, the benefits are partially linked to the contribu - tions paid into the plan. Certain features of Swiss pen - sion plans required by law preclude the plans from being categorized as defined contribution plans. These factors include a minimum interest guarantee on retirement sav - ings accounts, a predetermined factor for converting the accumulated savings account balance into a pension, and embedded death and disability benefits. All benefits granted under Swiss-based pension plans are vested, and Swiss legislation prescribes that the employer has to contribute a fixed percentage of an employee's pay to an external pension fund. Additional employer contributions may be required whenever the plan's statutory funding ratio falls below a certain level. The employee also contributes to the plan. The pension plans are run by separate legal entities, each governed by a board of trustees that - for the principal plans - con - sists of representatives nominated by Novartis and the active insured employees. The boards of trustees are responsible for the plan design and asset investment strategy. In December 2020, the Board of Trustees of the Novartis Swiss Pension Fund agreed to adjust the annu - ity conversion rate at retirement with effect from Janu - ary 1, 2022. This amendment does not affect existing pensioners, and its impact on existing plan participants will be mitigated by way of defined compensatory mea - sures. This amendment resulted in a net pre-tax curtail - ment gain of USD 101 million (CHF 90 million). The United States pension plans represent the sec - ond-largest component of the Group's total DBO and plan assets. The principal plans (Qualified Plans) are funded, whereas plans providing additional benefits for executives (Restoration Plans) are unfunded. Employer contributions are required for Qualified Plans whenever the statutory funding ratio falls below a certain level. Furthermore, in certain countries, employees are cov - ered under other post-employment benefit plans and post-retirement medical plans. In the US, other post-employment benefit plans con - sist primarily of post-employment healthcare benefits, which have been closed to new members since 2015. Part of the costs of these plans is reimbursable under the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Mod - ernization Act of 2003. There is no statutory funding requirement for these plans. The Group is funding these plans to the extent that it is tax efficient.Notes to the Novartis Group consolidated financial statements F-59The following tables are a summary of the funded and unfunded defined benefit obligation for pension and other post-employment benefit plans of employees at December 31, 2021 and 2020: Pension plans Other post-employment benefit plans (USD millions) 2021 2020 2021 2020 Benefit obligation at January 1 25602 23066 632 746 Current service cost 415 372 11 11 Interest cost 151 222 16 20 Past service costs and settlements 63 - 102 - 3 1 Administrative expenses 24 24 Remeasurement (gains)/losses arising from changes in financial assumptions - 713 1166 - 20 40 Remeasurement (gains)/losses arising from changes in demographic assumptions - 377 - 28 4 - 13 Experience-related remeasurement losses/(gains) 531 159 - 47 - 132 Currency translation effects - 865 1810 - 1 - 7 Benefit payments - 1450 - 1264 - 32 - 33 Contributions of employees 179 186 Effect of acquisitions, divestments or transfers 23 - 9 - 1 Benefit obligation at December 31 23583 25602 560 632 Fair value of plan assets at January 1 22317 19810 89 134 Interest income 105 166 2 4 Return on plan assets excluding interest income 1512 1318 7 4 Currency translation effects - 726 1620 Novartis Group contributions 490 464 7 - 20 Contributions of employees 179 186 Settlements - 7 15 Benefit payments - 1450 - 1264 - 32 - 33 Effect of acquisitions, divestments or transfers 2 Fair value of plan assets at December 31 22420 22317 73 89 Funded status - 1163 - 3285 - 487 - 543 Limitation on recognition of fund surplus at January 1 - 51 - 65 Change in limitation on recognition of fund surplus (incl. exchange rate differences) - 10 16 Interest income on limitation of fund surplus - 1 - 2 Limitation on recognition of fund surplus at December 31 - 62 - 51 Net liability in the balance sheet at December 31 - 1225 - 3336 - 487 - 543 The reconciliation of the net liability from January 1 to December 31 is as follows: Pension plans Other post-employment benefit plans (USD millions) 2021 2020 2021 2020 Net liability at January 1 - 3336 - 3321 - 543 - 612 Current service cost - 415 - 372 - 11 - 11 Net interest expense - 47 - 58 - 14 - 16 Administrative expenses - 24 - 24 Past service costs and settlements - 70 117 3 - 1 Remeasurements 2071 21 70 109 Currency translation effects 139 - 190 1 7 Novartis Group contributions 490 464 7 - 20 Effect of acquisitions, divestments or transfers - 23 11 1 Change in limitation on recognition of fund surplus - 10 16 Net liability at December 31 - 1225 - 3336 - 487 - 543 Amounts recognized in the consolidated balance sheet Prepaid benefit cost 1415 202 Accrued benefit liability - 2640 - 3538 - 487 - 543 Notes to the Novartis Group consolidated financial statements F-60The following table shows a breakdown of the DBO for pension plans by geography and type of member, and the breakdown of plan assets into the geographical locations in which they are held: 2021 2020 United Rest of United Rest of (USD millions) Switzerland States the world Total Switzerland States the world Total Benefit obligation at December 31 15268 type of - 411 - 1301 - 1573 - 3285 The following table shows a breakdown of the DBO for other post-employment benefit plans by geography and type of member, and the breakdown of plan assets into the geographical locations in which they are held: 2021 2020 United Rest of United Rest of (USD millions) States the world Total States the world Total Benefit obligation at December 31 473 87 560 543 89 632 Thereof unfunded 400 87 487 454 89 543 By type of member Active 60 23 83 80 25 105 Deferred pensioners 13 0 13 17 0 17 Pensioners 400 64 464 446 64 510 Fair value of plan assets at December 31 73 0 73 89 0 89 Funded status - 400 - 87 - 487 - 454 - 89 - 543 The following table shows the principal weighted average actuarial assumptions used for calculating defined ben - efit plans and other post- employment benefits of employees: Pension plans Other post-employment benefit plans 2021 2020 2019 2021 2020 2019 Weighted average assumptions used to determine benefit obligations at December 31 Discount rate 0.9% 0.6% 1.0% 3.3% Expected rate of salary increase Interest on savings account 0.5% 0.1% 0.3% Current average life expectancy for a 65-year-old male in years 22 22 22 21 21 21 Current average life expectancy for a 65-year-old female in years 24 24 24 23 23 23 Changes in the aforementioned actuarial assumptions can result in significant volatility in the accounting for the Group's pension plans in the consolidated financial state - ments. This can result in substantial changes in the Group's other comprehensive income, long-term liabili - ties and prepaid pension assets. The DBO is significantly impacted by assumptions regarding the rate that is used to discount the actuari - ally determined post-employment benefit liability. This rate is based on yields of high-quality corporate bonds in the country of the plan. Decreasing corporate bond yields decrease the discount rate, so that the DBO increases and the funded status decreases.In Switzerland, an increase in the DBO due to lower discount rates is slightly offset by lower future benefits expected to be paid on the employee's savings account where the assumption on interest accrued changes in line with the discount rate. The impact of decreasing interest rates on a plan's assets is more difficult to predict. A significant part of the plan assets is invested in bonds. Bond values usually rise when interest rates decrease and may therefore par - tially compensate for the decrease in the funded status. Furthermore, pension assets also include significant holdings of equity instruments. Share prices tend to rise when interest rates decrease and therefore often coun - teract the negative impact of the rising defined benefit Notes to the Novartis Group consolidated financial statements F-61obligation on the funded status (although the correlation of interest rates with equities is not as strong as with bonds, especially in the short term). The expected rate for pension increases significantly affects the DBO of most plans in Switzerland, Germany and the United Kingdom. Such pension increases also decrease the funded status, although there is no strong correlation between the value of the plan assets and pension/inflation increases. Assumptions regarding life expectancy significantly impact the DBO. An increase in longevity increases the DBO. There is no offsetting impact from the plan assets, as no longevity bonds or swaps are held by the pension funds. Generational mortality tables are used where this data is available. The following table shows the sensitivity of the defined benefit pension obligation to the principal actu - arial assumptions for the major plans in Switzerland, the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany and Japan on an aggregated basis: Change in 2021 year-end (USD millions) defined benefit pension obligation 25 basis point increase in discount rate - 790 25 basis point decrease in discount rate 839 One-year increase in life expectancy 869 25 basis point increase in rate of pension increase 512 25 basis point decrease in rate of pension increase - 136 25 basis point increase of interest on savings account 58 25 basis point decrease of interest on savings account - 58 25 basis point increase in rate of salary increase 54 25 basis point decrease in rate of salary increase - 54 The healthcare cost trend rate assumptions used for other post- employment benefits are as follows: 2021 2020 2019 Healthcare cost trend rate assumed for next year 6.0% 6.3% 6.5% Rate to which the cost trend rate is assumed to decline 4.5% 4.5% 4.5% Year that the rate reaches the ultimate trend rate 2028 2028 2028 The following table shows the weighted average plan asset allocation of funded defined benefit pension plans at December 31, 2021 and 2020: Pension plans Long-term Long-term target target (as a percentage) minimum maximum 2021 2020 Equity securities 15 40 27 28 Debt securities 20 60 33 34 Real estate 5 30 19 17 Alternative investments 0 20 15 13 Cash and other investments 0 15 6 8 Total 100 100 Cash and most of the equity and debt securities have a quoted market price in an active market. Real estate and alternative investments, which include hedge fund, pri - vate equity, infrastructure and commodity investments, usually have a quoted market price or a regularly updated net asset value. The strategic allocation of assets of the different pen - sion plans is determined with the objective of achieving an investment return that, together with the contributions paid by the Group and its employees, is sufficient to main - tain reasonable control over the various funding risks of the plans. Based upon the market and economic envi - ronments, actual asset allocations may temporarily be permitted to deviate from policy targets. The asset allo - cation currently includes investments in shares of Novartis AG as per the below table: December 31, December 31, 2021 2020 Investment in shares of Novartis AG Number of shares (in millions) 2.3 2.3 Market value (in USD billions) 0.2 0.2 The weighted average duration of the defined benefit obligation is 14.9 years (2020: 15.4 years). The Group's ordinary contribution to the various pen - sion plans is based on the rules of each plan. Additional contributions are made whenever this is required by stat - ute or law (i.e., usually when statutory funding levels fall below predetermined thresholds). The only significant plans that are foreseen to require additional funding are those in the United Kingdom and Germany. The expected future cash flows in respect of pension and other post-employment benefit plans at December 31, 2021, were as follows: Other post- employment (USD millions) Pension plans benefit plans Novartis Group contributions 2022 (estimated) 424 39 Expected future benefit payments 2022 1234 39 2023 2027-2031 5454 178 Defined contribution plans In many subsidiaries, employees are covered by defined contribution plans. Contributions charged to the consol - idated income statement for the defined contribution plans were: (USD millions) 2021 2020 2019 Contributions for defined contribution plans continuing operations 523 501 422 For defined contribution plans for discontinued opera - tions, see Note 30.Notes to the Novartis Group consolidated financial statements F-6226. Equity-based participation plans for employees The expense related to all equity-based participation plans and the liabilities arising from equity-based pay- ment transactions were as follows: (USD millions) 2021 2020 2019 Expense related to equity-based participation plans 979 958 1067 Liabilities arising from equity-based payment transactions 253 269 326 Equity-based participation plans can be separated into the following plans: Annual Incentive The Annual Incentive for the Novartis Group CEO and other Executive Committee members (ECN) is paid 50% in cash and 50% in Novartis restricted shares (RSs) or restricted share units (RSUs). For the Novartis Top Lead - ers (NTLs), the Annual Incentive is paid 70% in cash and 30% in RSs or RSUs. Both the ECN and NTLs can opt to invest up to the maximum cash portion of their Annual Incentive to receive further RSs or RSUs. Any cash is paid out during February or March in the year following the end of the performance period, and the shares are granted during January in the year following the end of the performance period. Share savings plans Employees in certain countries and certain key execu - tives worldwide are encouraged to invest their Annual Incentive in a share savings plan. Under the share savings plan, participants may elect to receive their relevant compensation fully or partially in Novartis shares in lieu of cash. As a reward for their participation in the share savings plan, at no additional cost to the participant, Novartis matches their invest - ments in shares after a holding period of three or five years. Novartis operates share savings plans for which employ - ees may only participate in one of the share savings plans in any given year. The most significant are listed below: In Switzerland, Employee Share Ownership Plan (ESOP) participants may choose to receive their Annual Incentive (i) 100% in shares, (ii) 50% in shares and 50% in cash, or (iii) 100% in cash. After expiration of a three-year holding period for Novartis shares invested under the ESOP, participants will receive one matching share for every two invested shares. Employees eligible for the equity plan \"Select\" are not eligible to receive ESOP matching shares starting with the 2017 performance period. The Leveraged Share Savings Plan (LSSP) was avail - able to key executives for performance periods prior to 2016. At the participant's election, the Annual Incen - tive was awarded partly or entirely in shares. The elected number of shares is subject to a holding period of five years. At the end of the holding period, Novartis will match the invested shares at a ratio of 1-to-1 (i.e., one share awarded for each invested share). In the United States, both the LSSP award and the corre - sponding match are cash settled. The Novartis Group CEO, the other Executive Commit - tee members from 2014, and the NTLs from 2016 are not eligible to participate in the share savings plans. Novartis equity plan \"Select\" The equity plan \"Select\" is a global equity incentive plan under which eligible employees may annually be awarded a grant subject to a three-year, and for selected units a four-year, staggered vesting period. No awards are granted for performance ratings below a certain thresh - old. Executive Committee members and NTLs are not eligible to participate in the equity plan \"Select.\" The equity plan \"Select\" currently allows participants in Switzerland to choose the form of their equity com - pensation in RSs or RSUs. In all other jurisdictions, RSs or RSUs are granted unilaterally. Until 2013, participants could also choose to receive part or the entire grant in the form of tradable share options. Tradable share options expire on their 10 th anniver - sary from the grant date. Each tradable share option enti - tles the holder to purchase after vesting (and before the 10th anniversary from the grant date) one Novartis share at a stated exercise price that equals the closing market price of the underlying share at the grant date. As the exercise price does not reflect the decrease in the Novartis share due to the Alcon spin, one-fifth of an Alcon share will also be awarded to the option holder upon exercise.

Participants are granted a target number of perfor - mance share units (PSUs) at the beginning of every per - formance period, which are converted into unrestricted Novartis shares after the performance period. The actual payout depends on the achievement of the performance measures and ranges between 0% and 200% of the granted amount. PSUs granted under the LTPP do not carry voting rights, but do carry dividend equivalents that are paid in unrestricted Novartis shares at the end of the performance period. The LTPP awards are subject to a three-year perfor - mance and vesting period. Until 2018, the performance criteria were based on Novartis internal performance metrics. Starting in 2019, following the combination of the two LTPP and LTRPP, for new grants the perfor - mance criteria are based on both Novartis internal per - formance metrics and variables that can be observed in the market, which is the ranking of the Novartis total shareholder return (TSR) relative to a global healthcare peer group of 14 other companies, over rolling three-year performance periods. TSR for Novartis and the peer companies is calcu - lated as the change in the company share price, which is translated to USD at the relevant exchange rate, includ - ing the reinvestment return of dividends, over the three- year performance period. The calculation is based on Bloomberg standard published TSR data, which is pub - licly available. The position of Novartis in the peer group determines the payout range based on a payout matrix. Long- T erm Relative Performance Plan The LTRPP is an equity plan for the Novartis ECN and NTLs. The last grant under this plan was made in 2018. The LTRPP performance criteria are based on variables that can be observed in the market, which is the ranking of the Novartis TSR relative to a global healthcare peer group of 14 other companies, over rolling three-year per - formance periods. The TSR for Novartis and the peer companies is calculated as described in the LTPP sec - tion above. Other share awards Selected employees may exceptionally receive Special Share Awards of RSs or RSUs. These Special Share Awards provide an opportunity to reward outstanding achievements or exceptional performance, and aim to retain key contributors. They are based on a formal inter - nal selection process, through which the individual per - formance of each candidate is thoroughly assessed at several management levels. Special Share Awards have a minimum three-year vesting period. In exceptional cir - cumstances, Special Share Awards may be awarded to attract special expertise and new talents to the organization. Externally recruited ECN members are eli - gible only for special awards that are \"buyouts\" in the case that it is to replace equity forfeited with their for - mer employer. The equity is provided on a like-for-like basis as the forfeited equity, at the same value with the same vesting period, and with or without a performance condition. Worldwide, employees at different levels in the orga - nization were awarded RSs and RSUs in 2021, 2020 and 2019. In addition, in 2021, 2020 and 2019, Board members received unrestricted shares as part of their regular com - pensation.Notes to the Novartis Group consolidated financial statements F-64 Summary of non-vested share grants The table below provides a summary of non-vested share grants (RSs, RSUs and PSUs) for all plans: 2021 2020 Weighted Weighted Number average fair Number average fair of shares value at grant of shares value at grant in millions date in USD in millions date in USD Annual Incentive - RSU 0.2 87.5 0.3 86.8 - Restricted shares 0.1 97.0 0.1 96.0 Share savings plans - RSU 0.4 86.9 0.4 87.0 - Shares 1.1 97.0 1.4 96.0 Select North America (RSU) 4.3 86.9 3.3 86.7 Select outside North America - RSU 1.8 86.9 1.5 87.0 - Restricted shares 0.6 97.0 0.5 96.0 Long-Term Performance Plan (PSU) 1.8 89.5 2.5 85.1 Long-Term Relative Performance Plan 1 0.2 0.0 Other share awards - RSU 0.6 78.4 1.3 77.0 - Restricted shares 0.1 88.7 - Shares 0.1 91.9 0.1 88.5 1 LTRPP grants in 2020 represent incremental payouts based on performance criteria under the plan. 27. Transactions with related parties Roche Holding AG Novartis has two agreements with Genentech, Inc., United States (Genentech), and one agreement with Spark Therapeutics, Inc., United States (Spark). Both companies are subsidiaries of Roche Holding AG (Roche), which were indirectly included in the consoli - dated financial statements using equity accounting until November 3, 2021, when Novartis entered into an agree - ment with Roche to divest its 33.3% of Roche voting shares. On December 6, 2021, Novartis divested its investment in Roche, on which date Roche ceased to be a related party (see Notes 2 and 4). Lucentis Novartis has licensed from Genentech/Roche the exclu - sive rights to develop and market Lucentis outside the United States for indications related to diseases of the eye. Novartis pays royalties on the net sales of Lucentis products outside the United States. From January 1, 2021 until December 6, 2021, Lucentis sales of USD 2.0 billion (2020: USD 1.9 billion; 2019: USD 2.1 billion) Novartis and Xolair the United States, where Genentech/Roche records all sales. Novartis records sales outside the United States. Novartis markets Xolair and records all sales and related costs outside the United States as well as co-pro - motion costs in the US. Genentech/Roche and Novartis share the resulting profits from sales in the United States, Europe and other countries, according to agreed prof - it-sharing percentages. From January 1, 2021 until December 6, 2021, Novartis recognized total sales of Xolair of USD 1.3 billion (2020: USD 1.3 billion; 2019: USD 1.2 billion), including sales to Genentech/Roche for the United States market. Luxturna In 2018, Novartis entered into an exclusive licensing and commercialization agreement and a supply agreement with Spark for Luxturna outside the United States. The agreements include regulatory and sales milestones as well as royalties payable to Spark on ex-US sales. On December 17, 2019, Roche acquired Spark. The net income for royalties, cost sharing and profit shar - ing arising out of the Lucentis , Xolair and Luxturna agree - ments with Roche totaled USD 188 million from January 1, 2021 until December 6, 2021 (net income in 2020: USD 217 million; net income in 2019: USD 101 million). Furthermore, Novartis has several patent license, supply and distribution agreements with Roche.Notes to the Novartis Group consolidated financial statements F-65Novartis Pension Fund In 2018, a Group subsidiary provided an uncommitted overnight credit facility to the Novartis Pension Fund, Switzerland, for up to USD 500 million with interest at the US Federal Funds Rate. This credit facility was not utilized during the current and past years. Executive Officers and Non-Executive Directors compensation At December 31, 2021, there were 12 Executive Com - mittee members (\"Executive Officers\"). During 2021, 3 Executive Officers stepped down. At December 31, 2020, there were 13 Executive Officers. At December 31, 2019, there were 13 Executive Officers. During 2019, 2 Executive Officers stepped down. The total compensation for Executive Committee members and the 14 Non-Executive Directors ( 14 in 2020 and 13 in 2019) using the Group's accounting policies for equity-based compensation and pension benefits was as fol - lows: Executive Officers Non-Executive Directors Total (USD millions) 2021 2020 2019 2021 2020 2019 2021 2020 2019 Cash and other compensation 20.3 25.6 20.7 4.7 4.6 4.1 25.0 30.2 24.8 Post-employment benefits 2.5 2.7 2.6 2.5 2.7 2.6 Equity-based compensation 37.3 41.1 40.6 5.2 5.2 4.6 42.5 46.3 45.2 Total 60.1 69.4 63.9 9.9 9.8 8.7 70.0 79.2 72.6 During 2021, the IFRS compensation expense decreased due to one role less at the ECN, and lower cash and equity compensation attributable to former ECN mem - bers, partially offset by the net increase of the IFRS com - pensation expense of current ECN members. During 2020, the IFRS compensation expense increased due to higher cash and other compensation. This increase in cash compensation is mainly attribut - able to ECN members who joined the ECN during 2019. As a result, 2019 represented only a portion of their annual compensation. Other compensation increased on account of higher social security payments on vested equity-based compensation. The Annual Incentive award, which is fully included in equity- based compensation even when paid out in cash, is granted in January in the year following the reporting period. The disclosures on Board and executive compensa - tion required by the Swiss Code of Obligations and in accordance with the Swiss Ordinance against Excessive Compensation in Stock Exchange Listed Companies are shown in the Compensation Report of the Group. T ransactions with former members of the Board of Directors During 2021, 2020 and 2019, the following payments (or waivers of claims) were made to former Board members or to \"persons closely\" linked to them: 60000 60000 60000 Dr. Alex Krauer, Honorary Chairman, was entitled to an amount of CHF 60 000 for annual periods from one AGM to the next. This amount was fixed in 1998 upon his departure from the Board in 1999, and has not been revised since that date. 28. Commitments and contingencies Research and development commitments The Group has entered into long-term research and development agreements with various institutions related to intangible assets, which provide for potential mile - stone payments by Novartis. As of December 31, 2021, the Group's commitments to make payments under those agreements, and their estimated timing, were as follows:(USD millions) 2021 2022 602 3839 Total Notes to the Novartis Group consolidated financial statements F-66Commitments for capital calls The Group holds investments in funds in which it has committed to invest further upon future capital calls. As of December 31, 2021, the total uncalled capital commit - ments for the Group's investments in funds amounts to USD 71 million. Note 29 contains further information on the Group's investments in funds. Other commitments The Group has entered into various purchase commit - ments for services and materials as well as for equip - ment in the ordinary course of business. These commit - ments are generally entered into at current market prices and reflect normal business operations. For disclosure of property, plant and equipment purchase commit - ments, see Note 9. Guarantees issued The Group has issued guarantees to third parties in the ordinary course of business, mostly for tax, customs or other governmental agencies. In addition, Novartis AG is guarantor of the Group's issued bonds, credit facilities and commercial paper pro - grams. Contingencies Group companies have to observe the laws, government orders and regulations of the country in which they operate. A number of Novartis companies are, and will likely continue to be, subject to various legal proceedings and investigations that arise from time to time, including pro - ceedings regarding product liability; sales and market - ing practices; commercial disputes; employment and wrongful discharge; and antitrust, securities, health and safety, environmental, tax, international trade, privacy and intellectual property matters. As a result, the Group may become subject to substantial liabilities that may not be covered by insurance and that could affect our business, financial position and reputation. While Novartis does not believe that any of these legal proceedings will have a material adverse effect on its financial position, litigation is inherently unpredictable and large judgments sometimes occur. As a consequence, Novartis may in the future incur judgments or enter into settlements of claims that could have a material adverse effect on its results of operations or cash flow. Governments and regulatory authorities around the world have been stepping up their compliance and law enforcement activities in recent years in key areas, including marketing practices, pricing, corruption, trade restrictions, embargo legislation, insider trading, anti - trust, cyber security and data privacy. Further, when one government or regulatory authority undertakes an inves - tigation, it is not uncommon for other governments or regulators to undertake investigations regarding the same or similar matters. Responding to such investiga - tions is costly and requires an increasing amount of man - agement's time and attention. In addition, such investi - gations may affect our reputation, create a risk of potential exclusion from government reimbursement programs in the United States and other countries, and lead to (or arise from) litigation. These factors have con - tributed to decisions by Novartis and other co mpanies in the healthcare industry, when deemed in their interest, to enter into settlement agreements with governmental authorities around the world prior to any formal decision by the authorities or a court. These government settle - ments have involved and may in the future involve large cash payments, sometimes in the hundreds of millions of dollars or more, including the potential repayment of amounts allegedly obtained improperly and other pen - alties, including treble damages. In addition, settlements of government healthcare fraud cases often require companies to enter into corporate integrity agreements, which are intended to regulate company behavior for a period of years. Our affiliate Novartis Corporation is a party to such an agreement, which will expire in 2025. Also, matters underlying governmental investigations and settlements may be the subject of separate private litigation. While provisions have been made for probable losses, which management deems to be reasonable or appro - priate, there are uncertainties connected with these estimates. Note 20 contains additional information on these matters. A number of Group companies are involved in legal proceedings concerning intellectual property rights. The inherent unpredictability of such proceedings means that there can be no assurances as to their ultimate out - come. A negative result in any such proceeding could potentially adversely affect the ability of certain Novartis companies to sell their products, or require the payment of substantial damages or royalties. In the opinion of management, however, the outcome of these actions will not materially affect the Group's financial position but could be material to the results of operations or cash flow in a given period. The Group's potential environmental remediation lia - bility is assessed based on a risk assessment and inves - tigation of the various sites identified by the Group as at risk for environmental remediation exposure. The Group's future remediation expenses are affected by a number of uncertainties. These uncertainties include, but are not limited to, the method and extent of remediation, the per - centage of material attributable to the Group at the reme - diation sites relative to that attributable to other parties, and the financial capabilities of the other potentially responsible parties.

Fair value by hierarchy As required by IFRS, financial assets and liabilities recorded at fair value in the consolidated financial state - ments are categorized based upon the level of judgment associated with the inputs used to measure their fair value. There are three hierarchical levels, based on increasing subjectivity associated with the inputs to derive fair valuation for these assets and liabilities, which are as follows:The assets carried at Level 1 fair value are equity and debt securities listed in active markets. The assets generally included in Level 2 fair value hierarchy are foreign exchange and interest rate deriva - tives, and certain debt securities. Foreign exchange and interest rate derivatives are valued using corroborated market data. The liabilities generally included in this fair value hierarchy consist of foreign exchange and interest rate derivatives. Level 3 inputs are unobservable for the asset or lia - bility. The assets generally included in Level 3 fair value hierarchy are various investments in hedge funds and unquoted equity security investments. Contingent con - sideration carried at fair value is included in this cate - gory. 2021 (USD millions) Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total Financial assets Debt securities 1 2010 2010 Cash and cash equivalents 2010 2010 Marketable securities - debt securities 2719 22 2741 Total marketable securities 2719 22 2741 Derivative financial instruments 105 105 Total marketable securities and derivative financial instruments 2719 127 2846 Debt and equity securities 1080 617 1697 Fund investments 28 338 366 Contingent consideration receivables 641 641 Total long-term financial investments 1108 1596 2704 Associated companies at fair value through profit and loss 192 192 Financial liabilities Contingent consideration payables - 1075 - 1075 Other financial liabilities - 19 - 19 Derivative financial instruments - 68 - 68 Total financial liabilities at fair value - 68 - 1094 - 1162 1 Includes short-term highly rated government-backed debt securities, with an original maturity of three months or lessNotes to the Novartis Group consolidated financial statements F-70 2020 (USD millions) Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total Financial assets Debt securities 26 26 Total marketable securities 26 26 Derivative financial instruments 159 159 Total marketable securities and derivative financial instruments 185 185 Debt and equity securities 1153 460 1613 Fund investments 30 336 366 Contingent consideration receivables 625 625 Total long-term financial investments 1183 1421 2604 Associated companies at fair value through profit and loss 211 211 Financial liabilities Contingent consideration payables - 1046 - 1046 Other financial liabilities - 23 - 23 Derivative financial instruments - 194 - 194 Total financial liabilities at fair value - 194 - 1069 - 1263 The change in carrying values associated with Level 3 financial instruments, using significant unobservable inputs during the year ended December 31, is set forth below: 2021 Associated companies at Long-term Contingent Contingent fair value through Fund financial consideration consideration (USD millions) profit and loss investments investments receivables payables January 1 211 366 460 625 - 1046 Fair value gains and other adjustments, including from divestments recognized in the consolidated income statement 2 70 69 124 182 Fair value losses (including impairments and amortizations) and other adjustments recognized in the consolidated income statement - 26 - 8 - 13 - 44 - 189 Fair value adjustments recognized in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income, including currency translation effects - 2 - 1 51 - 22 22 Purchases 34 12 137 - 88 Cash receipts and payments - 42 44 Disposals - 27 - 71 - 43 Reclassification - 30 - 44 December 31 192 338 617 641 - 1075 Total of fair value gains and losses recognized in the consolidated income statement for assets and liabilities held at December 31, 2021 - 24 62 56 80 - 7 Notes to the Novartis Group consolidated financial statements F-71 2020 Associated companies at Long-term Contingent Contingent Other fair value through Fund financial consideration consideration financial (USD millions) profit and loss investments investments receivables payables liabilities January 1 186 233 581 399 - 1036 - 29 Fair value gains and other adjustments, including from divestments recognized in the consolidated income statement 57 151 34 173 206 Fair value losses (including impairments and amortizations) and other adjustments recognized in the consolidated income statement - 18 - 8 - 39 - 90 - 3 Fair value adjustments recognized in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income 4 3 33 40 - 62 - 2 Purchases 24 17 123 43 - 123 Cash receipts and payments - 30 63 11 Disposals - 23 - 61 - 109 Reclassification - 19 31 - 163 - 4 December 31 211 366 460 625 - 1046 - 23 Total of fair value gains and losses recognized in the consolidated income statement for assets and liabilities held at December 31, 2020 39 143 - 5 173 116 - 3 During 2021, there were several individually non-signifi - cant transfers of equity securities from Level 3 to Level 1 for USD 73 million (2020: USD 166 million), due to Ini - tial Public Offerings of the invested companies. During 2021, there was a transfer of equity securities of USD 29 million from Level 1 to Level 3 due to de-listing (2020: nil). Realized gains and losses associated with Level 3 long-term financial investments measured at fair value through the consolidated income statement are recorded in the consolidated income statement under \"Other income\" or \"Other expense,\" respectively. Realized gains and losses associated with Level 3 long-term financial investments measured at fair value through other com - prehensive income are not recycled through the consol - idated income statement but are instead reclassified to retained earnings. During the year, the net loss and net gain recorded on associated companies, fund investments and long- term financial investments at fair value through profit and loss were USD 173 million and USD 212 million, respec - tively. To determine the fair value of a contingent consideration, various unobservable inputs are used. A change in these inputs might result in a significantly higher or lower fair value measurement. The inputs used are, among others, the probability of success, sales fore - cast and assumptions regarding the discount rate and timing and different scenarios of triggering events. The inputs are interrelated. The significance and usage of these inputs to each contingent consideration may vary due to differences in the timing and triggering events for payments or in the nature of the asset related to the con - tingent consideration. If the most significant parameters for the Level 3 input were to change by 10% positively or negatively, or where the probability of success (POS) is the most significant input parameter, 10% were added or deducted from the applied probability of success, for contingent consider - ation payables and contingent consideration receivables, this would change the amounts recorded in the 2021 consolidated income statement by USD 246 million and USD 198 million, respectively. Equity securities measured at fair value through other comprehensive income Equity securities held as strategic investments, typically held outside the Novartis Venture Fund, are generally designated at date of acquisition as financial assets val - ued at fair value through other comprehensive income with no subsequent recycling through profit and loss. These are made up of individually non-significant invest - ments. At December 31, 2021, the Group holds 60 non- listed equity securities (December 31, 2020: 56 ) and 40 listed equity securities (December 31, 2020: 34) in this category with the following fair values: (USD millions) 2021 2020 Listed equity securities 888 862 Non-listed equity securities 307 249 Total equity securities 1195 1111 During 2021, dividends received from these equity secu - rities were insignificant (2020: nil ). In 2021, in accordance with the consolidated foundations Alcon Inc. shares divestment plans, Alcon Inc. shares with a fair value of USD 9 million were sold (2020: USD 331 million), and the USD 1 million gain on disposal (2020: USD 13 million gain) was transferred from other comprehensive income to retained earnings during 2021. In addition, in 2021, equity securities that were no longer considered strategic, with a fair value of USD 254 million (2020: USD 206 million), were sold, and the USD 211 million gain on disposal (2020: USD 137 million gain) was transferred from other comprehensive income to retained earnings (see Note 8).Notes to the Novartis Group consolidated financial statements F-72Nature and extent of risks arising from financial instruments Market risk Market risk in general comprises currency risk, interest rate risk and price risk, such as commodity and equity prices. Novartis is exposed to market risk, primarily related to foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and the market value of the investments. The Group actively monitors and seeks to reduce, where it deems it appropriate to do so, fluctuations in these exposures. It is the Group's policy and practice to enter into a vari - ety of derivative financial instruments to manage the vol - atility of these exposures. It does not enter into any finan - cial transactions containing a risk that cannot be quantified at the time the transaction is concluded. In addition, it does not sell short assets it does not have, or does not know it will have, in the future. The Group only sells existing assets or enters into transactions and future transactions (in the case of anticipatory hedges) that it confidently expects it will have in the future, based on past experience. Foreign currency exchange rate risk The Group uses the US dollar as its reporting currency. As a result, the Group is exposed to foreign currency exchange movements, primarily in European, Japanese and emerging market currencies. Fluctuations in the exchange rates between the US dollar and other curren - cies can have a significant effect on both the Group's results of operations, including reported sales and earn - ings, as well as on the reported value of our assets, lia - bilities and cash flows. This, in turn, may significantly affect the comparability of period-to-period results of operations. Because our expenditures in Swiss francs are sig - nificantly higher than our revenues in Swiss francs, vol - atility in the value of the Swiss franc can have a signifi - cant impact on the reported value of our earnings, assets and liabilities, and the timing and extent of such volatility can be difficult to predict. There is also a risk that certain countries could devalue their currency. If this occurs, it could impact the effective prices we would be able to charge for our prod - ucts and also have an adverse impact on both our con - solidated income statement and balance sheet. Subsidiaries whose functional currencies have expe - rienced a cumulative inflation rate of more than 100% over the past three years apply the rules of IAS 29 \"Finan - cial reporting in Hyperinflationary Economies.\" The hyperinflationary economies in which Novartis operates are Argentina and Venezuela. Venezuela was hyperinfla - tionary for all years presented, and Argentina became hyperinflationary effective July 1, 2018, requiring retro - active implementation of hyperinflation accounting as of January 1, 2018. The impacts of applying IAS 29 were not significant in all years presented. The Group manages its global currency exposure by engaging in hedging transactions where management deems appropriate. Novartis may enter into various con - tracts that reflect the changes in the value of foreign cur - rency exchange rates to preserve the value of assets, commitments and anticipated transactions. Novartis also uses forward contracts and may enter into foreign cur - rency option contracts to hedge. Net investments in subsidiaries in foreign countries are long-term investments. Their fair value changes through movements of foreign currency exchange rates. The Group has designated a certain portion of its long-term euro-denominated straight bonds as hedges of the translation risk arising on certain of these net invest - ments in foreign operations with euro functional cur - rency. As of December 31, 2021, long-term financial debt with a carrying amount of EUR 1.8 billion (USD 2.1 billion; December 31, 2020: USD 2.3 billion), has been desig - nated as a hedge instrument. During 2021, USD 216 mil- lion of net of taxes unrealized income (unrealized loss in 2020: USD 201 million) was recognized in other compre - hensive income and accumulated in currency translation effects in relation with this net investment hedge. The hedge remained effective since inception, and no amount was recognized in the consolidated income statement in 2021, 2020 and 2019. Commodity price risk The Group has only a very limited exposure to price risk related to anticipated purchases of certain commodities used as raw materials by the Group's businesses. A change in those prices may alter the gross margin of a specific business, but generally by not more than 10% of the margin and thus below the Group's risk management tolerance levels. Accordingly, the Group does not enter into significant commodity futures, forward or option contracts to manage fluctuations in prices of anticipated purchases. Interest rate risk The Group addresses its net exposure to interest rate risk mainly through the ratio of its fixed-rate financial debt to variable-rate financial debt contained in its total financial debt portfolio. To manage this mix, Novartis may enter into interest rate swap agreements, in which it exchanges periodic payments based on a notional amount and agreed-upon fixed and variable interest rates. Equity risk The Group may purchase equities as investments of its liquid funds. As a policy, it limits its holdings in an unre - lated company to less than 5% of its liquid funds. Poten - tial investments are thoroughly analyzed. Call options are written on equities that the Group owns, and put options are written on equities that the Group wants to buy and for which cash is available. Credit risk Credit risks arise from the possibility that customers may not be able to settle their obligations as agreed. To man - age this risk, the Group periodically assesses country and customer credit risk, assigns individual credit limits, and takes actions to mitigate credit risk where appropri - ate. The provisions for expected credit losses for cus - tomers are based on a forward-looking expected credit loss, which includes possible default events on the trade receivables over the entire holding period of the trade receivables.Notes to the Novartis Group consolidated financial statements F-73In measuring the expected credit losses, trade receiv - ables are grouped based on shared credit risk charac - teristics (such as private versus public receivables) and days past due. In determining the expected credit loss rates, the Group considers current and forward-looking macroeconomic factors that may affect the ability of the customers to settle the receivables, and historical loss rates for each category of customers. The Group's largest customer accounted for approx - imately 17% of net sales, and the second largest and third largest customers accounted for 11% and 6% of net highest amounts of trade receivables outstand - ing were for these same three customers and amounted to 16%, 12% and 7% , respectively, of the 2021 (2020: 14% , 12% and 6%, respectively). There is no other significant concen - tration of customer credit risk. Counterparty risk Counterparty risk encompasses issuer risk on market - able securities and money market instruments; credit risk on cash, time deposits and derivatives; as well as settle - ment risk for different instruments. Issuer risk is reduced by only buying securities that are at least A- rated. Coun - terparty credit risk and settlement risk are reduced by a policy of entering into transactions with counterparties (banks or financial institutions) that feature a strong credit rating. Exposure to these risks is closely moni - tored and kept within predetermined parameters. The limits are regularly assessed and determined based upon credit analysis, including financial statement and capital adequacy ratio reviews. In addition, reverse repurchas - ing agreements are contracted, and Novartis has entered into credit support agreements with various banks for derivative transactions. To further reduce the settlement risk, the Group has implemented a multi-currency sys - tem, Continuous Linked Settlement (CLS), providing mul - tilateral netting (payment-versus-payment settlement) of cash flows from foreign exchange transactions. The Group's cash and cash equivalents include short- term highly rated government-backed debt securities, with an original maturity of three months or less, for approximately 16% (2020: nil ) as well as cash and cash equivalents held with major regulated financial institu - tions; the three largest ones hold any losses from non-per - formance by these counterparties and does not have any significant grouping of exposures to financial sector or country risk. Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is defined as the risk that the Group could not be able to settle or meet its obligations associated with financial liabilities that are settled by delivering cash or another financial asset. Group Treasury is responsi - ble for liquidity, funding and settlement management. In addition, liquidity and funding risks, and related pro - cesses and policies, are overseen by management. Novartis manages its liquidity risk on a consolidated basis according to business needs and tax, capital or regulatory considerations, if applicable, through numer - ous sources of financing in order to maintain flexibility. Certain countries have legal or economic restrictions on the ability of subsidiaries to transfer funds to the Group in the form of cash dividends, loans or advances, but these restrictions do not have an impact on the abil - ity of the Group to meet its cash obligations. Management monitors the Group's net debt or liquid - ity position through rolling forecasts on the basis of expected cash flows. Novartis has two US commercial paper programs under which it can issue up to USD 9.0 billion in the aggregate of unsecured commercial paper notes. Novartis also has one Japanese commercial paper pro - gram under which it can issue up to JPY 150 billion (approximately USD 1.3 billion) of unsecured commercial paper notes. Commercial paper notes totaling USD 0.9 billion under these three programs were outstanding as per December 31, 2021 (2020: USD 4.3 billion). Novartis further has a committed credit facility of USD 6.0 billion, which was renewed in September 2019. This credit facil - ity is provided by a syndicate of banks and is intended to be used as a backstop for the US commercial paper programs. The facility matures in September 2024 and was undrawn as per December 31, 2021, and December 31, 2020. In December 2019, Novartis entered into a short-term credit facility of USD 7 billion, with a maturity date of June 30, 2020, with a syndicate of banks. On January 7, 2020, Novartis borrowed USD 7 billion under the facility with interest based on the USD LIBOR. On February 14, 2020, Novartis repaid the full USD 7 billion initially borrowed. The facility expired on June 30, 2020.Notes to the Novartis Group consolidated financial statements F-74The following table sets forth how management monitors net debt or liquidity based on details of the remaining contractual maturities of current financial assets and liabilities, excluding trade receivables and payables as well as contingent considerations at December 31, 2021, and December 31, 2020: 2021 Due later than Due later than Due later than one month three months one year Due within but less than but less than but less than Due after (USD millions) one month three months one year five years five years Total Current assets Marketable securities, time deposits and short-term investments with original maturity more than 90 days and accrued interest 11 14585 1088 4 18 15706 Commodities 111 111 Derivative financial instruments 21 64 7 13 105 Cash and cash equivalents 7406 5001 12407 Total current financial assets 7438 19650 28329 Non-current liabilities Financial debt 8464 - 14438 - 22902 Financial debt - undiscounted - 8490 - 14587 - 23077 Total non-current financial debt - 8464 - 14438 - 22902 Current liabilities Financial debt - 2780 - 521 - 2926 - 6227 Financial debt - 2780 - 521 - 2928 - 6229 Derivative financial instruments - 50 - 16 - 2 - 68 Total current financial debt - 2830 - 537 - 2928 - 6295 Net debt 4608 19113 - 1833 - 8460 - 14296 - 868 2020 Due later than Due later than Due later than one month three months one year Due within but less than but less than but less than Due after (USD millions) one month three months one year five years five years Total Current assets Marketable securities, time deposits and short-term investments with original maturity more than 90 days 13 1571 25 5 21 1635 Commodities 111 111 Derivative financial instruments and accrued interest 38 110 4 4 3 159 Cash and cash equivalents 8558 1100 9658 Total current financial assets 8609 2781 29 9 135 11563 Non-current liabilities Financial debt - 10621 - 15638 - 26259 Financial debt - undiscounted - 10661 - 15802 - 26463 Total non-current financial debt - 10621 - 15638 - 26259 Current liabilities Financial debt - 4195 - 2218 - 3178 - 9591 Financial debt - 4195 - 2219 - 3179 - 9593 Derivative financial instruments - 93 - 84 - 17 - 194 Total current financial debt - 4288 - 2302 - 3195 - 9785 Net debt - 3166 - 10612 - 15503 - 24481 The consolidated balance sheet amounts of financial lia - bilities included in the above analysis are not materially different to the contractual amounts due on maturity. The positive and negative fair values on derivative financial instruments represent the net contractual amounts to be exchanged at maturity.Notes to the Novartis Group consolidated financial statements F-75The Group's contractual undiscounted potential cash flows from derivative financial instruments to be settled on a gross basis are as follows: 2021 Due later than Due later than one month three months Due within but less than but less than (USD millions) one month three months one year Total Derivative financial instruments and accrued interest on derivative financial instruments Potential outflows in various currencies - from financial derivative liabilities - 843 - 5482 - 461 - 6786 Potential inflows in various currencies - from financial derivative assets 847 5516 457 6820 2020 Due later than Due later than one month three months Due within but less than but less than (USD millions) one month three months one year Total Derivative financial instruments and accrued interest on derivative financial instruments Potential outflows in various currencies - from financial derivative liabilities - 930 - 4096 - 719 - 5745 Potential inflows in various currencies - from financial derivative assets 904 4114 710 5728 Other contractual liabilities that are not part of management's monitoring of the net debt or liquidity consist of the following items: 2021 Due later than Due later than three months one year Due within but less than but less than Due after (USD millions) three months one year five years five years Total Contractual interest on non-current liabilities - 82 - 445 - 1628 - 3908 - 6063 Lease liabilities - 78 - 197 - 639 - 982 - 1896 Trade payables - 5373 - 180 - 5553 Commitment for repurchase of own shares - 2809 - 2809 Contingent consideration liabilities - 54 - 65 - 517 - 439 - 1075 2020 Due later than Due later than three months one year Due within but less than but less than Due after (USD millions) three months one year five years five years Total Contractual interest on non-current liabilities - 82 - 468 - 1846 - 4251 - 6647 Lease liabilities - 77 - 209 - 692 - 1027 - 2005 Trade payables - 5239 - 164 - 5403 Commitment for repurchase of own shares - 1769 - 1769 Contingent consideration liabilities - 24 - 38 - 639 - 345 - 1046 Capital risk management Novartis strives to maintain a strong credit rating. In man - aging its capital, Novartis focuses on maintaining a strong balance sheet. As of December 31, 2021, Moody's Investors Service rated the Company A1 for long-term maturities and P-1 for short-term maturities, and S&P Global Ratings rated the Company AA- for long-term maturities and A-1+ for short-term maturities. Sensitivity analysis The Group uses sensitivity analysis disclosures to pro - vide quantitative information about market risks to which it is exposed. The sensitivity analysis disclosures are in line with the Group's financial risk management policy, and enhance disclosures by moving to a one-parameter risk model that considers a one-factor linear relationship between risk factors and exposures, as compared to a Notes to the Novartis Group consolidated financial statements F-76multi-parameter model under Value-at-risk which was disclosed in prior years. The sensitivity analysis disclo - sures consider aggregated risk exposure arising from the most significant risk factors (currency risk, interest rate risk and equity prices risk) and includes all financial assets and financial liabilities as set forth in the table on page F-67. The disclosures below illustrate the potential impact on the Group's consolidated financial statements as a result of hypothetical market movements in foreign cur - rency exchange rates, interest rates and equity prices. The range of variables chosen reflects management's view of changes that are reasonably possible over a one- year period. Foreign currency exchange rate sensitivity The Group uses the US dollar as its reporting currency. As a result, the Group is exposed to foreign currency exchange movements, primarily in European, Japanese and emerging market currencies, as well as in the Swiss franc. A strengthening (weakening) of the US dollar against these currencies as of December 31, 2021 and 2020 would have affected the measurement of financial instruments denominated in these foreign currencies. This analysis assumes that all other variables, in partic - ular interest rates, remain constant. A hypothetical 5% increase or decrease in the foreign currency exchange rates against the US dollar would have impacted the Group's consolidated income statement as presented below: (USD millions) 2021 2020 5% increase in currency exchange rates against USD 3 5 5% decrease in currency exchange rates against USD - 3 - 5 As of December 31, 2021, the Group designated EUR 1.8 billion (December 31, 2020: EUR 1.8 billion) of its long- term euro-denominated straight bonds as hedges of the translation risk arising on certain net investments in for - eign operations with euro functional currency. This anal - ysis assumes that all other variables, in particular inter - est rates, remain constant. A hypothetical 5% increase, or decrease, in the foreign currency exchange rates against the US dollar, without considering the translation effect of these net investments, would have impacted the Group's consolidated equity as presented below: (USD millions) 2021 2020 5% increase in currency exchange rates against USD 99 108 5% decrease in currency exchange rates against USD - 104 - 114 Interest rate sensitivity Our portfolio of fixed-income instruments as of Decem - ber 31, 2021, was mainly composed of time deposits and debt securities. Novartis uses duration models to approximate the possible change in the value of fixed-income instru - ments. Based on these models, management believes that a 100-basis point change in interest is deemed a reasonable possible change over a one-year period. Based on exposures in 2021 and 2020, a hypotheti - cal 100-basis point increase (decrease) in interest rates would not have resulted in a significant increase (decrease) in the fair values of the fixed-income instru - ments. In addition, a hypothetical 100-basis point increase (decrease) in interest rates would not have resulted in a material increase (decrease) of cash flows attributable to such fixed-income instruments. The vast majority of our outstanding financial debts are with fixed interest rates and are therefore not affected by movements in interest rates. Equity price sensitivity Fund investments and equity securities held by the Novartis Venture Fund are valued at fair value through profit and loss. Equity securities held as strategic invest - ments, typically held outside the Novartis Venture Fund, are generally designated at date of acquisition as finan - cial assets valued at fair value through other compre - hensive income with no subsequent recycling through profit and loss. The fair value of these fund investments and equity securities was USD 2.2 billion as of December 31, 2021 (December 31, 2020: USD 2.2 billion). The fair values of these investments are impacted by the volatility of the stock market, valuation parameters applied (for non- listed equities) and changes in general economic factors. This analysis assumes that all other variables, in partic - ular interest rates, remain constant. A hypothetical increase or decrease of 15% in the risk factors would have impacted the Group's consolidated income state - ment as presented below: (USD millions) 2021 2020 15% increase in equity prices 154 156 15% decrease in equity prices - 154 - 156 A hypothetical increase or decrease of 15% in the risk factors would have impacted the Group's consolidated equity as presented below: (USD millions) 2021 2020 15% increase in equity prices 179 167 15% decrease in equity prices - 179 - 167 Notes to the Novartis Group consolidated financial statements F-77 30. Discontinued operations Discontinued operations include the operational results from the Alcon eye care devices business and certain Corporate activities attributable to the Alcon business prior to the spin-off, the gain on distribution of Alcon Inc. to Novartis AG shareholders, and certain other expenses related to the Distribution (refer to Notes 1 and 2 for fur - ther details). The Alcon eye care devices business researched, discovered, developed, manufactured, distributed and sold a broad range of eye care products. Alcon was orga - nized into two global business franchises, Surgical and Vision Care. Alcon also provided services, training, edu - cation and technical support for both the Surgical and Vision Care businesses. Consolidated income statement (USD millions) 2019 1 Net sales to third parties from discontinued operations 1777 Sales to continuing segments 32 Net sales from discontinued operations 1809 Cost of goods sold - 860 Gross profit from discontinued operations 949 Selling, general and administration - 638 Research and development - 142 Other income 15 Other expense - 113 Operating income from discontinued operations 71 Interest expense - 10 Other financial income and expense - 3 Income before taxes from discontinued operations 58 Income taxes - 159 Net loss from discontinued operations before gain on distribution of Alcon Inc. to Novartis AG shareholders - 101 Gain on distribution of Alcon Inc. to Novartis AG shareholders 2 4691 Net income from discontinued operations 4590 1 The consolidated income statement amounts are for the period from January 1, 2019, to the completion of the spin-off. 2 See Note 2 for further details on the non-taxable, non-cash gain on distribution of Alcon Inc. to Novartis AG shareholders. Supplemental disclosures related to the Alcon business distributed to Novartis AG shareholders Additional significant accounting policies The accounting policies mentioned in Note 1 were used for the reporting of discontinued operations. The follow - ing additional significant accounting policies were appli - cable to discontinued operations. Intangible assets available for use In addition to currently marketed products, technologies and other intangible assets (including computer soft - ware), discontinued operations intangible assets avail - able for use also included marketing know-how and the Alcon brand name. Marketing know-how represents the value attribut - able to the expertise acquired for marketing and distrib - uting Alcon surgical products. The Alcon brand name was shown separately, as it was the only Novartis intangible asset that was available for use with an indefinite useful life. Novartis considers that it was appropriate that the Alcon brand name had an indefinite life since Alcon-branded products had a history of strong revenue and cash flow performance, and Novartis had the intent and ability to support the brand with spending to maintain its value for the fore - seeable future. The Alcon brand name was not amor - tized as it had an indefinite useful life, but was evaluated for potential impairment annually. The following table shows the respective useful lives for available-for-use intangible assets and the location in the consolidated income statement in which the respective amortization and any potential impairment charge were recognized: Income statement location for amortization and Useful life impairment charges Marketing know-how 25 years \"Cost of goods sold\" Alcon brand name Not amortized, \"Other expense\" indefinite useful life The estimates used in calculating the net present values are highly sensitive and depend on assumptions specific to the nature of the activities and more specifically on appropriate royalty rate for the Alcon brand name.Notes to the Novartis Group consolidated financial statements F-78Revenue recognition In the Alcon Division, which is reported as discontinued operations, surgical equipment may have been sold together with other products and services under a sin - gle contract. Revenues were recognized upon satisfac - tion of each of the performance obligations in the con - tract and the consideration was allocated based on the standalone selling price of each performance obligation. For surgical equipment, in addition to cash and install - ment sales, revenue was recognized under finance and operating lease arrangements. Arrangements in which substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to own - ership transfers to the customer were treated as finance lease arrangements. Revenue from finance lease arrangements was recognized at amounts equal to the fair value of the equipment, which approximated the present value of the minimum lease payments under the arrangements. As interest rates embedded in lease arrangements were approximately market rates, revenue under finance lease arrangements was comparable to revenue for outright sales. Finance income for arrange - ments longer than 12 months was deferred and subse - quently recognized based on a pattern that approxi - mated to the use of the effective interest method and was recorded in \"Other income.\" Operating lease reve - nue for equipment rentals was recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Net income Included in net income from discontinued operations are: (USD millions) 2019 Depreciation of property, plant and equipment - 42 Depreciation of right-of-use assets - 9 Amortization of intangible assets - 174 Equity-based compensation of Novartis equity plans - 9 Cash flows used in investing activities from discontinued operations Cash flows used in investing activities from discontinued operations include the investing activities of the Alcon business and cash outflows for transaction-related expenditures attributable to the series of portfolio trans - formation transactions completed in 2015. (USD millions) 2020 2019 Payments attributable to the spin-off of the Alcon business - 39 - 29 Divested cash and cash equivalents - 628 Cash flows attributable to the spin-off of the Alcon business - 39 - 657 Other cash flows used in investing activities, net - 88 - 502 Net cash flows used in investing activities from discontinued operations - 127 - 1159 Cash flows from financing activities from discontinued operations In 2020, the net cash outflows used in financing activi - ties from discontinued operations of USD 50 million was for transaction cost payments directly attributable to the distribution (spin-off) of the Alcon business to Novartis AG shareholders. In 2019, the net cash inflows from financing activities from discontinued operations of USD 3.3 billion included mainly USD 3.5 billion cash inflows from Alcon borrow - ings in connection with the distribution (spin-off) of the Alcon business to Novartis AG shareholders, partly off - set by USD 0.2 billion transaction cost payments directly attributable to the distribution (spin-off) of the Alcon business to Novartis AG shareholders (see Notes 1 and 2). Defined contribution plans In many subsidiaries, employees are covered by defined contribution plans. Contributions charged to the consol - idated income statement for the defined contribution plans were: (USD millions) 2019 Contributions for defined contribution plans discontinued operations 33 Significant transactions In March 2019, Alcon acquired PowerVision, Inc. (PowerVision), a privately held, US-based medical device development company focused on developing accom - modative, implantable intraocular lenses. The fair value of the total purchase consideration was USD 424 million. The amount consisted of an initial cash payment of USD 289 million and the fair value of the contingent consid - eration of USD 135 million, due to PowerVision share - holders, which they are eligible to receive upon the achievement of specified regulatory and commercializa - tion milestones. The purchase price allocation resulted in net identifiable assets of USD 418 million, consisting of intangible assets of USD 505 million, net deferred tax liabilities of USD 93 million, other net assets of USD 6 million, and goodwill of USD 6 million. The 2019 results of operations since the date of the acquisition were not material. For additional information related to the distribution (spin-off) of the Alcon business to Novartis AG shareholders, effected through a dividend in kind distribution that was completed on April 8, 2019, refer to Note 1 and Note 2.Notes to the Novartis Group consolidated financial statements F-7931. Events subsequent to the December 31, 2021, consolidated balance sheet date Aimovig -Amgen dispute On January 31, 2022 Novartis and Amgen entered into a settlement agreement related to Aimovig litigation. For additional information see Note 20. Dividend proposal for 2021 and approval of the Group's 2021 consolidated financial statements On February 1, 2022, the Novartis AG Board of Directors proposed the acceptance of the 2021 consolidated financial statements of the Novartis Group for approval by the Annual General Meeting on March 4, 2022. Fur - thermore, also on February 1, 2022, the Board proposed a dividend of CHF 3.10 per share to be approved at the Annual General Meeting on March 4, 2022. If approved, total dividend payments would amount to approximately USD 7.6 billion (2020: USD 7.4 billion), using the CHF/ USD December 31, 2021, exchange rate.Notes to the Novartis Group consolidated financial statements F-80 32.

bn = billion Report of the statutory auditor F-82Report of the statutory auditor to the General Meeting of Novartis AG Basel Report on the audit of the consolidated financial statements Opinion We have audited the consolidated financial statements of Novartis AG and its subsidiaries (the \"Group\"), which comprise the consolidated income statement and con - solidated statement of comprehensive income for the year ended December 31, 2021, the consolidated bal - ance sheet as at December 31, 2021, and the consoli - dated statement of changes in equity and consolidated statement of cash flows for the year then ended, and notes to the consolidated financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies. In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements (pages F-1 to F-81) give a true and fair view of the con - solidated financial position of the Group as at December 31, 2021 and its consolidated financial performance and its consolidated cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and comply with Swiss law. Basis for opinion We conducted our audit in accordance with Swiss law, International Standards on Auditing (ISAs) and Swiss Auditing Standards. Our responsibilities under those pro - visions and standards are further described in the \"Audi - tor's responsibilities for the audit of the consolidated financial statements\" section of our report. We are independent of the Group in accordance with the provisions of Swiss law and the requirements of the Swiss audit profession, as well as the International Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants (including Inter - national Independence Standards) of the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants (IESBA Code), and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. Our audit approach Overview Overall Group materiality was USD 575 million We conducted full scope audit work at the Group's two operating divisions. We also conducted full scope audit work at four reporting entities in two countries. In addi - tion, full scope audit work on account balances or specified procedures was performed at 19 reporting entities in 13 countries. Our audit scope addressed 64% of the Group's net sales and 86% of Group's total assets. As key audit matters the following areas of focus have been identified: Intangible Assets Impairment Assessments - Innovative Medicines Division Currently Marketed Products US Managed Care, Medicare Part D and Medicaid Rebates Materiality The scope of our audit was influenced by our applica - tion of materiality. Our audit opinion aims to provide rea - sonable assurance that the consolidated financial state - ments are free from material misstatement. Misstatements may arise due to fraud or error. They are considered material if, individually or in aggregate, they could rea - sonably be expected to influence the economic deci - sions of users taken on the basis of the consolidated financial statements. Based on our professional judgment, we determined certain quantitative thresholds for materiality, including the overall Group materiality for the consolidated finan - cial statements as a whole as set out below. These, together with qualitative considerations, helped us to determine the scope of our audit and the nature, timing and extent of our audit procedures and to evaluate the effect of misstatements, if any, both individually and in aggregate, on the consolidated financial statements as a whole. Overall Group materiality USD 575 million Benchmark applied Profit before tax Rationale for the materiality benchmark applied We chose income before taxes from continuing opera - tions as the materiality measure because, in our view, it is the measure against which the performance of the Group is most commonly measured and it is a generally accepted benchmark. We agreed with the Audit and Compliance Committee that we would report to them misstatements identified during our audit above USD 25 million as well as any mis - statements below that amount which, in our view, war - ranted reporting for qualitative reasons. Audit scope We tailored the scope of our audit in order to perform sufficient work to enable us to provide an opinion on the consolidated financial statements as a whole, taking into account the structure of the Group, the accounting pro - cesses and controls, and the industry in which the Group operates.Report of the statutory auditor F-83The Group financial statements are a consolidation of over 200 reporting entities. We identified four report - ing entities that, in our view, required an audit of their complete financial information due to their size or risk characteristics. We worked very closely with and received full scope reporting from the divisional audit teams for Innovative Medicines and Sandoz, each being a global business. To obtain appropriate coverage of material bal - ances, we also received 19 full scope reports from report - ing entity audit teams for the full scope audit work per - formed on account balances and one specified procedures report. None of the reporting entities excluded from our Group audit scope individually con - tributed more than 5% to net sales or total assets. Audit procedures were also performed by the Group audit team over the Group's Corporate activities, certain Group functions (including accounting for associated compa - nies, taxation, treasury, certain employee benefits, gov - ernment investigations and litigation) and Group consol - idation. To exercise the appropriate direction and supervision over the work of the divisional and reporting entity audit teams, the Group audit team reviewed audit working papers, virtually participated in meetings between the divisional and reporting entity audit teams, and virtually attended selected meetings between divisional manage - ment and divisional audit teams. Key audit matters Key audit matters are those matters that, in our profes - sional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. Intangible Assets Impairment Assessments - Innovative Medicines Division Currently Marketed ProductsKey audit matter As described in Notes 1 and 11 to the consolidated finan - cial statements, the Group has intangible assets in its Innovative Medicines Division other than goodwill total - ing USD 32.4 billion at December 31, 2021, including cur - rently marketed products of USD 25.9 billion. The Group recognized impairments of intangible assets in its Innovative Medicines Division other than goodwill of USD 367 million during the year. In most cases, no directly observable market inputs are available to measure the fair value less costs of disposal that is used to determine if the asset is impaired. Therefore, an estimate is derived indirectly and is based on net present value techniques utilizing post-tax cash flows and discount rates. The esti - mates that management used in calculating the net pres - ent values depend on assumptions specific to the nature of the Innovative Medicines Division's activities with regard to the amount and timing of projected future cash flows; long-term sales forecasts; actions of competitors (launch of competing products, marketing initiatives, etc.); sales erosion rates after the end of patent or other intellectual property rights protection, and timing of the entry of generic competition; outcome of research and development activities (compound efficacy, results of clinical trials, etc.); amount and timing of projected costs to develop in-process research and development into commercially viable products; profit margins; probability of obtaining regulatory approval; future tax rate; and dis - count rate. The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the intangible assets impairment assessments of the Innovative Medicines Division currently marketed products is a key audit matter are the significant judgment by management when developing the net present value of the intangible assets. This in turn led to a high degree of auditor judg - ment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and evaluating management's significant assumptions related to the amount and timing of projected future cash flows (specifically the long-term sales forecasts). How our audit addressed the key audit matter Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with form - ing our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to management's intan - gible assets impairment assessments, including controls over the Innovative Medicines Division currently mar - keted products. These procedures also included, among others, testing management's process for developing the fair value estimate; evaluating the appropriateness of the net present value techniques; testing the completeness and accuracy of underlying data used in the model; and evaluating the significant assumptions used by manage - ment, including the amount and timing of projected future cash flows. Evaluating management's assumptions related to the amount and timing of projected future cash flows involved evaluating whether the assumptions used by management were reasonable considering the cur - rent and past performance of the intangible assets, the consistency with external market and industry data, and whether these assumptions were consistent with evi - dence obtained in other areas of the audit. As a result of our procedures, we did not propose any adjustments to the amount of impairment recognized in 2021. For Innovative Medicines Division currently mar - keted products where management determined that no impairment was required, we found that the assessments made by management were based upon reasonable assumptions, consistently applied. US Managed Care, Medicare Part D and Medicaid RebatesKey audit matter As described in Note 1 and 22 to the consolidated finan - cial statements, the consideration Novartis receives in exchange for its goods or services may be fixed or vari - able. Variable consideration is only recognized when it is highly probable that a significant reversal will not occur. Rebates and discounts granted to government agencies, wholesalers, retail pharmacies, managed healthcare organizations and other customers, as well as charge - backs are provisioned and recorded as a revenue deduc - tion at the time the related revenues are recorded or when the incentives are offered. They are calculated on Report of the statutory auditor F-84the basis of historical experience, regulations, the spe - cific terms in the individual agreements, product pricing and the mix of products, contracts, channels and pay - ors. The provision reported as of December 31, 2021 for revenue deductions amounted to USD 6.5 billion, a sig - nificant portion of which related to US Managed Care, Medicare Part D and Medicaid rebates. The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the US Managed Care, Medicare Part D and Medicaid rebates is a key audit matter are the significant judgment by management due to the significant measurement uncertainty involved in developing these provisions, as the provisions are based on assumptions developed using historical expe - rience, regulations, the specific terms in the individual agreements, product pricing and the mix of products, contracts, channels and payors. This in turn led to a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity and effort in applying procedures relating to these assumptions. How our audit addressed the key audit matter Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with form - ing our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to provisions for the US Managed Care, Medicare Part D and Medicaid rebate programs, including controls over the assumptions used to estimate these rebates. These procedures also included, among others, developing an independent esti - mate of the rebates by utilizing third-party information on price and market conditions in the US, the terms of the specific rebate programs, and the historical trend of actual rebate claims paid; comparing the independent estimate to management's estimates; and testing rebate claims processed by the Group, including evaluating those claims for consistency with the contractual and mandated terms of the Group's rebate arrangements. We did not identify any material differences between our expectations and the accruals, and we found the judgments made by management to be reasonable. Other information in the Annual Report The Board of Directors is responsible for the other infor - mation in the Annual Report. The other information com - prises all information included in the Annual Report, but does not include the consolidated financial statements, the stand-alone financial statements and the remunera - tion report of Novartis AG and our auditor's reports thereon. Our opinion on the consolidated financial statements does not cover the other information in the Annual Report, and we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon. In connection with our audit of the consolidated finan - cial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information in the Annual Report and, in doing so, con - sider whether the other information is materially incon - sistent with the consolidated financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstate - ment of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard. Responsibilities of the Board of Directors for the consolidated financial statements The Board of Directors is responsible for the prepara - tion of the consolidated financial statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with IFRS and the pro - visions of Swiss law, and for such internal control as the Board of Directors determines is necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. In preparing the consolidated financial statements, the Board of Directors is responsible for assessing the Group's ability to continue as a going concern, disclos - ing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the Board of Directors either intends to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so. Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the consolidated financial statements Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with Swiss law, ISAs and Swiss Auditing Standards will always detect a material mis - statement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements. As part of an audit in accordance with Swiss law, ISAs and Swiss Auditing Standards, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism through - out the audit. We also: Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material mis - statement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control. Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances. Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made.Report of the statutory auditor F-85 Conclude on the appropriateness of the Board of Directors' use of the going concern basis of account - ing and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or con - ditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor's report to the related dis - closures in the consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opin - ion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report. How - ever, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern. Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and con - tent of the consolidated financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the consolidated finan - cial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation. Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the Group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion. We communicate with the Board of Directors, mostly through the Audit and Compliance Committee, regard - ing, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we iden - tify during our audit. We also provide the Board of Directors with a state - ment that we have complied with relevant ethical require - ments regarding independence, and communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may rea - sonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, actions taken to eliminate threats or safeguards applied. From the matters communicated with the Board of Directors, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our audi - tor's report unless law or regulation precludes public dis - closure about the matter or when, in extremely rare cir - cumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse con - sequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such commu - nication. Report on other legal and regulatory requirements In accordance with article 728a paragraph 1 item 3 CO and Swiss Auditing Standard 890, we confirm that an internal control system exists which has been designed for the preparation of consolidated financial statements according to the instructions of the Board of Directors. We recommend that the consolidated financial state - ments submitted to you be approved.

Notes to the financial statements of Novartis AG A-3Notes to the financial statements of Novartis AG 1. Introduction The financial statements of Novartis AG, with its regis - tered office in Basel, comply with the requirements of the Swiss accounting legislation of the Swiss Code of Obligations (SCO).Novartis AG is presenting consolidated financial statements according to IFRS. Therefore, Novartis AG has applied the exemption included in article 961d, para - graph 1 SCO, and has not prepared additional disclo - sures, a separate cash flow statement and a manage - ment report for SCO purposes. 2. Accounting policies Financial income and expenses Current assets and current liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are converted at year-end exchange rates. Realized exchange gains and losses, and all unreali zed exchange losses arising from these as well as those from business transactions, are recorded net as financial income or financial expenses. Derivative financial instruments Derivative financial instruments are used for hedging pur - poses. These instruments are valued at fair value. When different accounting policies apply for the hedged item and the derivative financial instrument, hedge accounting is applied through measuring the hedged item together with the derivative financial instrument. Financial assets Financial assets are valued at acquisition cost less adjustments for foreign currency losses and any other impairment of value.Investments Investments are initially recognized at cost. Investments in Novartis Group subsidiaries are assessed annually and, in case of an impairment, adjusted to their recover - able amount within their category. Goodwill Goodwill is capitalized and amortized over a period of 20 years. Goodwill is reviewed for impairment on a yearly basis. If necessary, an impairment loss is recognized. Bonds Bonds are valued at nominal value. Any bond premium is accrued over the duration of the bond so that at maturity, the balance sheet amount will equal the amount that is due to be paid. Provisions Provisions are made to cover general business risks of the Group.Notes to the financial statements of Novartis AG A-43.

Litigation and settlement costs In 2020, Novartis resolved some legacy legal matters. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) investigations into Novartis are now closed, as settlements were reached with the US Department of Justice (DOJ) and the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). As part of the settlements, Novartis AG agreed to pay USD 9 mil - lion to the DOJ and USD 113 million to the SEC. The French Competition Authority (FCA) conducted an investigation into Lucentis against several Novartis subsidiaries. Novartis AG was jointly held liable for a fine of EUR 308 million. As Lucentis is not commercialized by Novartis AG itself, but by Novartis subsidiaries, Novartis AG was fully reimbursed by the operational sub - sidiary. 5.

The total share capital decreased from CHF 1 233.5 million at December 31, 2020, to CHF 1 217.2 million at December 31, 2021, due to a share capital reduction as a result of the cancellation of 32.6 million repurchased shares with a nominal value of CHF 16.3 million. The cancellation was approved at the Annual General Meeting on March 2, 2021, and became effective on July 8, 2021. During 2020, the total share capital decreased from CHF 1 263.7 million at December 31, 2019, to CHF 1 233.5 million at December 31, 2020, due to a share capital reduction as a result of the cancellation of 60.3 million repurchased shares with a nominal value of CHF 30.2 million. The cancellation was approved at the Annual General Meeting on February 28, 2020, and became effective on May 7, 2020.Notes to the financial statements of Novartis AG A-69. Legal capital reserves - capital contribution reserve The capital contribution reserve as of December 31, 2020, of CHF 178 837 279 has been fully used for the repurchase and cancellation of Novartis AG shares bought back under the authority granted by the Annual General Meeting on February 28, 2019. That use of the capital contribution reserve is in line with the provisions on Swiss withholding tax applicable as of January 1, 2020 (article 4a, paragraph 4 VStG). 10.

Treasury share purchases during 2021 totaled 32.2 million (2020: 34.3 million), with an average purchase price of CHF 82 (2020: CHF 81). No treasury share sales were executed during 2021 and 2020, and share-based compensation transactions totaled 9.9 million shares (2020: 11.4 million shares). The number of treasury shares held by the Company and its subsidiaries meet the definitions and require - ments of article 659b SCO. At December 31, 2021, treasury shares held by Novartis AG and its subsidiaries totaled 96 994 929. As per the dividend payment date, Novartis AG and its subsidiaries are expected to hold 107 848 581 shares. These shares are non- dividend- bearing shares. It should be noted that within the Novartis Group's IFRS consolidated financial statements, some Novartis entities are included in the consolidation scope. These entities are mainly foundations, which do not qual - ify as subsi diaries in the sense of article 659b SCO.Notes to the financial statements of Novartis AG A-711.

In December 2021, Novartis AG entered into an irre - vocable, non-discretionary arrangement with a bank to repurchase Novartis AG shares on the second trading line under its up-to USD 15.0 billion share buyback. Novartis AG is able to cancel this arrangement at any time but could be subject to a 90-day waiting period. The commitment under this arrangement therefore reflects the obligated purchases by the bank under such trading plan over a rolling 90-day period, or if shorter, until the maturity date of such trading plan. The commitment under this arrangement, based on Novartis AG share price at December 31, 2021, amounted to CHF 2.6 billion as of December 31, 2021.Notes to the financial statements of Novartis AG A-813.

Equity instrument disclosures for the Board of Directors and Executive Committee members Share ownership requirements for Board members The Chairman is required to own a minimum of 30 000 Novartis shares, and other members of the Board of Directors are required to own at least 5 000 Novartis shares within five years after joining the Board of Direc - tors, to ensure their interests are aligned with those of shareholders. Board members are prohibited from hedging or pledging their ownership positions in Novartis shares that are part of their guideline share ownership require - ment, and are required to hold these shares for 12 months after retiring from the Board of Directors. As at Decem - ber 31, 2021, all current and former members of the Board of Directors who were required to meet the minimum share ownership requirements did so. Shares, ADRs and share options owned by Board members As at December 31, 2021, no member of the Board of Directors, either individually or together with \"persons closely linked\"1 to them, owned 1% or more of the out - standing shares (or ADRs) of Novartis. As at the same date, no member of the Board of Directors held any share options to purchase Novartis shares. The total number of vested Novartis shares and ADRs owned by members of the Board of Directors and \" persons closely linked\"1 to them as at December 31, 2021, and as at December 31, 2020, is shown in the table below.

Report of the statutory auditor A-12Report of the statutory auditor to the General Meeting of Novartis AG Basel Report on the audit of the financial statements Opinion We have audited the financial statements of Novartis AG, which comprise the balance sheet as at December 31, 2021, income statement and notes for the year then ended, including a summary of significant accounting policies. In our opinion, the financial statements (pages A-1 to A-11) as at December 31, 2021 comply with Swiss law and the company's articles of incorporation. Basis for opinion We conducted our audit in accordance with Swiss law and Swiss Auditing Standards. Our responsibilities under those provisions and standards are further described in the \"Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the finan - cial statements\" section of our report. We are independent of the entity in accordance with the provisions of Swiss law and the requirements of the Swiss audit profession and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these require - ments. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. Our audit approach Materiality The scope of our audit was influenced by our applica - tion of materiality. Our audit opinion aims to provide rea - sonable assurance that the financial statements are free from material misstatement. Misstatements may arise due to fraud or error. They are considered material if, individually or in aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of the financial statements. Based on our professional judgement, we determined certain quantitative thresholds for materiality, including the overall materiality for the financial statements as a whole as set out in the table below. These, together with qualitative considerations, helped us to determine the scope of our audit and the nature, timing and extent of our audit procedures and to evaluate the effect of mis - statements, both individually and in aggregate, on the financial statements as a whole. Overall materiality CHF 412 million Benchmark applied Profit before tax Rationale for the materiality benchmark applied We chose income before taxes as the benchmark because, in our view, it is the benchmark against which the performance of Novartis AG is most commonly mea - sured, and it is a generally accepted benchmark. We agreed with the Audit and Compliance Committee that we would report to them misstatements above CHF 23 million identified during our audit as well as any mis - statements below that amount which, in our view, war - ranted reporting for qualitative reasons. Audit scope We designed our audit by determining materiality and assessing the risks of material misstatement in the finan - cial statements. In particular, we considered where sub - jective judgements were made; for example, in respect of significant accounting estimates that involved making assumptions and considering future events that are inherently uncertain. As in all of our audits, we also addressed the risk of management override of internal controls, including among other matters consideration of whether there was evidence of bias that represented a risk of material misstatement due to fraud. We tailored the scope of our audit in order to perform sufficient work to enable us to provide an opinion on the financial statements as a whole, taking into account the structure of the entity, the accounting processes and controls, and the industry in which the entity operates. Report on key audit matters based on the circular 1/2015 of the Federal Audit Oversight Authority We have determined that there are no key audit matters to communicate in our report. Responsibilities of the Board of Directors for the financial statements The Board of Directors is responsible for the prepara - tion of the financial statements in accordance with the provisions of Swiss law and the company's articles of incorporation, and for such internal control as the Board of Directors determines is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.Report of the statutory auditor A-13In preparing the financial statements, the Board of Direc - tors is responsible for assessing the entity's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the Board of Direc - tors either intends to liquidate the entity or to cease oper - ations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so. Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with Swiss law and Swiss Auditing Standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstate - ments can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic deci - sions of users taken on the basis of these financial state - ments. As part of an audit in accordance with Swiss law and Swiss Auditing Standards, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional scepticism through - out the audit. We also: Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is suffi - cient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opin - ion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the over - ride of internal control. Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the pur - pose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity's internal control. Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made. Conclude on the appropriateness of the Board of Directors' use of the going concern basis of account - ing and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or con - ditions that may cast significant doubt on the entity's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor's report to the related dis - closures in the financial statements or, if such disclo - sures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our con - clusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report. However, future events or conditions may cause the entity to cease to continue as a going concern.We communicate with the Board of Directors, mostly through the Audit and Compliance Committee, regard - ing, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we iden - tify during our audit. We also provide the Board of Directors with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, actions taken to eliminate threats or safe - guards applied. From the matters communicated with the Board of Direc - tors, we determine those matters that were of most sig - nificance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor's report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the pub - lic interest benefits of such communication. Report on other legal and regulatory requirements In accordance with article 728a paragraph 1 item 3 CO and Swiss Auditing Standard 890, we confirm that an internal control system exists which has been designed for the preparation of financial statements according to the instructions of the Board of Directors. We further confirm that the proposed appropriation of available earnings complies with Swiss law and the com - pany's articles of incorporation. We recommend that the financial statements submitted to you be approved. PricewaterhouseCoopers AG Claudia Benz Kris Muller Audit expert Global relationship Auditor in charge partner "}
