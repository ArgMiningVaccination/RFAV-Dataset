The medical treatment received was, without doubt, very thorough, informative and easily understood. I cannot thank the doctor concerned enough. All the staff, receptionists, nurses, and doctors are friendly and helpful whether on the telephone or face to face.

Thank you again! - Review titled Great experience Rated 5 stars out of 5 by Mrs Wolohan - Posted on 22 March 2022 I've always found the surgery effective and responsive, face to face appointments for my children, calls from GP's and medicine promptly sent to our choice of pharmacy. The receptionists are helpful and friendly. GP's and nurse listen to concerns, professional and helpful with treatment. I have no personal connection to the surgery - only as client.

Thank you again! - Review titled Never had any problems Rated 5 stars out of 5 by HelenaD - Posted on 04 March 2022 I keep seeing a lot of negative reviews about the practice but personally never had a bad experience or a problem getting an appt! Instead of spending hours on hold, I simply email my enquiry and reception staff call me back with appt. I work on reception in healthcare myself and understand pressures front of house as well as doctors and nurses are faced with. Please have some patience people!

Thanks again! - Review titled Superb service Rated 5 stars out of 5 by Anonymous - Posted on 19 January 2022 I was advised by a Chiropractor that I was attending for treatment away from the medical centre that my blood pressure was very high. I took readings and went to reception and asked if I could get advice. The receptionist took my information at 10.30 in the morning. At 11.00 I had a call and discussion with the doctor who agreed to increase my medication immediately. This helped to reduce my concerns and I was extremely impressed by the handling of my enquiry by the receptionist and the doctor.

Thank you again! - Review titled Upsetting experience Rated 2 stars out of 5 by Anonymous - Posted on 05 February 2022 I received a letter from the practice with an invitation and appointment for a health review. When I attended the GP did not know anything about it and seemed not to know what was expected. I said I had queries and was told I had better get on with them as time was short. Nothing appeared to fall within the GP's remit e.g. referrals for physio, memory loss. Much of the advice given was common sense. A review was carried out but only because I pushed. At the end of the appointment I said I was disappointed. After a lack of face to face appointments for some time due to covid and the fact it was supposed to be a medical review appointment I had expected more. At the end of the appointment the door was shut in my face when I was still speaking. I would not recommend this practice despite the fact that the receptionists are very sweet. A very unprofessional doctor and an upsetting experience all round. Visited January 2022 Review titled Heathcote Medical Centre Replied on 23 February 2022 Thank you for your review. I am sorry to hear that you found your recent experience upsetting. Your feedback refers to a specific event which myself and the clinician would be more than happy to respond to in detail from our medical records. May I suggest that you contact the practice directly with your details and we may then address your concerns. Thank you. - Review titled Excellent service Rated 5 stars out of 5 by Paula Slayford - Posted on 12 January 2022 The doctors and nurses are so lovely and the receptionist is more than helpful .

Report review titledas unsuitable - Review titled Great care Rated 5 stars out of 5 by Anonymous - Posted on 08 December 2021 Can not thank the team here and specifically my GP enough for the time and care given to me at a difficult time. Despite the pressures primary care is under attempts were made to re-contact and rebook my appointment, missed due to a fault with my phone, and then to go on to receive a thorough assessment and management plan beyond my expectations. I am overwhelmed by the care I have received and this does influence how I recover and seek support. Thank you Visited December 2021 Review titled Heathcote Medical Centre Replied on 17 December 2021 Thank you for taking the time to give your feedback and for recognizing the pressure primary care is under. I am glad that we were able to rebook your appointment and provide a thorough assessment and management plan.
