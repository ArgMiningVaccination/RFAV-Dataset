Ayurvedic therapies are gentle, yet powerful and are designed to restore, rejuvenate, and revitalize the body and mind by calming the nervous system, supporting immunity, and releasing stress and tension. These therapies are personalized according to the client's individual dosha (or constitution). thereby enhancing the overall spa experience, as the client will leave with a sense of renewal of mind, body, and spirit. SHIRODHARA THERAPY Shirodhara is a purifying and rejuvenating oil therapy designed to calm the nervous system and settle the mind. The head is continuously bathed in oil using a rhythmic technique for a fixed period of time. Shirodhara can relax the mind and help eliminate stagnant waste (loves) from the body by balancing your doshas. The calming effect it produces is similar to that achieved by meditation. MARMA THERAPY Marma points are doorways to the 7 Chakras - energy channels that flow through the spine and nourishes the body and mind.
