Drink your way to good health! Discover [5 Immune-Boosting Hot Drinks!](https://www.cleaneatingmag.com/slideshow/5-hot-drinks-that-will-keep-you-healthy-this-winter/) I attend many expos as a part of the exciting things I do to stay in touch with my readers and fans. I adore this aspect of my job. I can't imagine not attending the Arnold Sports Festival, for example, because the experience leaves me feeling enriched with stories and fan love for the rest of the year. But I know I will be standing on my feet eight hours a day for three days straight, not eating properly, shaking thousands of hands and not getting nearly enough sleep. I need to prepare for this as though I am going to battle. My immune system needs weapons to help me stay healthy and happy. When I pack my bag for this fan-love marathon, I fill a small zip-top bag with top immune-boosting players. Meet some of iodine (as my cancer shield), hydrochloric acid (HCL) tablets, raw honey and coconut oil.

This odd-looking rhizome looks more like a Halloween prop, but holds natural medicinal compounds perfect for shoring up immunity in the face of [cold and flu season](https://www.cleaneatingmag.com/articles/five-immunity-boosters-for-winter/). You may have reached for ginger primarily to deal with stomach upset as it has spectacular results in that department, but its strength lies in its immune-boosting superpowers. Ginger stimulates all aspects of immune function by firing up the circulatory system, warming the body and bringing on a sweat, thus boosting the body's ability to detoxify itself of harmful agents. At the root of it, ginger is a stimulant with anti-inflammatory properties. Ginger also increases white blood cell activity by phagocytosis, which is the process of chewing up white blood cell debris (can you picture Pac-Man here?). The knobby root also activates T cells, according to a 2008 article in BMC Complementary and Alternative Medicine. A critical piece of our immune system, T cells are a group of white blood cells that devour foreign cells as well as tumor cells. Therefore, ginger supports the body's own natural defense mechanisms. When your immune system is compromised, as I often feel it is when I sit on a plane even for a few hours, ginger is ideal for resetting the immune system. This rebalancing lends power to the entire set of mechanisms we are programmed with, moving us back to a place of health. When I travel, I swallow a few ginger gels to keep my tummy happy and my immune system on high alert. Strangers In The House Your personal \"house\" - the human body - needs daily cleaning. The body is equipped with spectacularly efficient systems that push out toxins, recycle necessary and precious materials and cleanse and rebuild itself. But today, we are exposed to foreign chemicals like never before. These strangers in your house are called xenobiotics. Xenobiotics are foreign substances that are neither produced by the body nor part of your daily diet. You could classify xenobiotics with pharmaceuticals, cigarettes, recreational drugs and in my opinion, processed sugars and foods. All of these cause untold human suffering and damage in the forms of cancer, addiction, disease and death. According to research studies conducted by the Indian Council of Medical Research in New Delhi, ginger may be effective in eliminating such unwanted chemicals from the body, while scientists at Georgia State University have discovered that whole ginger extract shows promising effects in stopping the growth of prostate cancer cells.
