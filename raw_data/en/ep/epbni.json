With Eve you feel that everything is real. With her you don't have the feeling of being a guest, but of being at home. She is a kind-hearted person who welcomes her fellow human beings and shows them what the important things in life are and what it means to be truly human. Through her energy and empathy, she has the ability to put people on the right path. It is important to be open to it, because in the end it is the person who has to solve the problem. But with her help she gives you the necessary motivation and hope that this will succeed. Eve and her family gave me a very good feeling and I would like to thank them from the bottom of my heart. The individual retreats were well coordinated, and in between you had the opportunity to retreat to the hotel for a few hours and process the experiences there, which I personally find very important. I would have preferred to stay a little longer, but it motivates me all the more to come here again.Visited November 2022Traveled soloWritten November 21, 2022 - Soul level connection and healingCame here for 5 nights session and it was truly amazing experience - the stay, the sessions, the hosts (Eve, Klaus and Ao). It was during my first solo trip and have no regrets. I loved all of it and you really need to come with open heart and mind to truly experience the sessions and wisdom that Eve has to offer. I felt so warm and welcomed by them and so grateful to have been brought here by divine. They're doing such great work of helping others which we need more of in this world more than ever. I definitely recommend staying hereVisited March 2023Traveled soloWritten March 12, 2023 - Mind blowingEve is a true healer, a beautiful shining soul! It is my greatest blessing to get to know her. She helped me through my emotionally most difficult time. I am forever grateful for her. Thank you Eve! I only can recommend you to visit her if you feel the urge!Visited January 2022Traveled soloWritten January 17, 2022 - An amazing experience at SuryamuniI have only just today left Suryamuni spiritual healing center with the amazing healing and guidance from Eve with the help of Klaus. It was such an unexpected experience that blew me away. From the moment that I sat down with Eve she told me the 2 things that were the reason that I came to her. Eve knew nothing about me, but immediately knew why I was there somehow via her intuition or channeling. It's something that I cannot properly explain. Their hospitality and food where amazing and it is an experience that I will repeat one day and I highly recommend this to everyone.Visited December 2022Traveled soloWritten December 19, 2022 - Exceptional Spiritual RetreatSuryamuni Spiritual Healing Center- I wanted to find a retreat that would assist me physically, emotionally, and spiritually and after looking up the available retreats in Thailand I was 1st attracted to The Suryamuni Healing Center. After having read all the other retreat options I found myself drawn to Evie, the retreats founder, as her message resonated with me. I found that the retreat surpassed my expectations and I was able to receive all that I hoped to gain from being there. The retreat was personalized exactly to my needs - vegetarian meals, the powerful detox, healing energy work, mantras, yoga, massages and the spiritual guidance. The staff are all amazing and supportive of your journey. Evie and Klaus ensure that all your needs are taking care of, and you feel well supported there. If you are going expecting a trendy upmarket retreat - this is not the one for you. However, if you want a truly genuine, authentic and spiritual retreat to discover more about yourself this is the one for you! Go find yourself!Visited June 2023Written July 15, 2023 - AmazingI truly enjoyed my visit and meeting Eve. I would highly recommend visiting the retreat. I have received a very warm welcome. I am very grateful to Eve and Klaus for everything. I felt like the weight was lifted of my shoulders. I will most definitely be coming back, only stayed for 3 days, but it was so worth it! It was very empowering, unique experience for me. Thanks Eve & Klaus! xxVisited May 2022Written June 22, 2022 - A life changing experienceWhen I saw Eve's picture on the website, I knew I had to meet that woman. Eve is a truely magical being: She is connected and knows what brings you there and what are the main knots in your life. If you are willing to receive, you will be given healing. I left lighter than I had walked in. I am very lucky to have found this retreat that took me straight to Samui and to Eve's center.Dear Yasmine, thanks for your nice words about me, I am happy that you enjoyed the time here with me and also that I could help you. I also enjoyed you to be my guest and I hope to see you again one day wish you all the best for your life Eve info@suryamuni-healing-center.comWritten July 31, 2023This response is the subjective opinion of the management representative and not of Tripadvisor LLC.Visited July 2023Traveled soloWritten July 21, 2023 - Do not go there if you respect your bodyA very harrowing experience at this place. Am surprised how this place has so many good reviews. If you respect your body and love your life you will not go to this place. Its not only wastage of time and money but is risky as well. Am listing down reason for the same. 1) I was surprised to find when i visited taht there is no schedule in the retreat. Only yoga in the morning and evening will be spent just looking at her cooking. She does not provide lunch. At times dinner was leftover from breakfast. i ended up getting bored whole day 2) Accomodation provided to me was at a low end resort 10 mins walking from the Suryamuni there was no one else in the resort so was scary to live there. Even there was no one at the reception 3) She only provided me a detox drink every day. Even after 2months of coming from there my joints are swollen and there is a lot of pain. am not able to move normally. When i wrote to her she did not even bother to reply. But when i wrote from another email id inquiring about the retreat she promptly replied. 4) during the retreat she used to remind me to tip the helper every day. 5) Also she kept telling me how many people who come for retreat gave her jewelry and extra cash.She also kept telling that she donate all these to the needy. i felt she was indirectly asking from me. 6) She kept saying to me every day that she is possessed by Hindu gods and godesses . And during karma cleansing when she says that god enters her body she told me the same things she used to tell me during dinner time. 6) I foun dout Neither the yoga teacher nor her helper nor the lady who does massages for the retreat have either taken detox or have done karma cleansing from her. 7)The retreat did not have any participant i was the only one. She does not have any infrastructure to have a retreat. 8)During 6 days of stay not a single local person came to meet her for treatment or anything else. She fools unsuspecting foreigners guess the locals know so they keep away. 9)I was surprised to know when i underwent the detox programme there is no infrastructure to test Blood pressure or any other doctor check up during detox. i dont know whether my joint pain will be healed or not but i hope at least this review will help others not get into the fraud.Visited September 2017Traveled soloWritten November 24, 2017 - Uncomfortable experienceI arrived for a 7 day retreat and met Evie. She was sweet. I settled into my room, my bed was covered in ants and there were lots of mozzies (I get that goes with the rainy season). I was the only person staying at the place which is in a fairly isolated area, even Evie said it's not safe. Evie's house is about 500m away which is a little scary when you are making your way to and from there in the dark on your own. Maybe I came at an unfortunate time (as Klaus was sick), but Evie spent much time talking of how different countries were really bad and it was quite difficult be constantly surrounded by that negativity. Things were disorganized and I spent much time sitting in the kitchen listening to the 6 dogs fight outside. The yoga with Kate was fantastic, couldn't speak more highly of her. No excursions out as mentioned but Evie did lend me a mountain bike so I could be more mobile. I just felt very wary in that area. I managed to push myself through 3 nights before I bailed to the safety of a hotel room less isolated. An expensive learning experience for me but I put my well being first. I had hoped for a truly enlightening experience, in a way, maybe I got one. I learnt that I have to trust my instincts. I feel like I have a responsibility to be honest about my experience as I was surprised by the very positive rating on here. I would hate to have someone experience what I did. Peace and blessings.Visited August 2016Traveled soloWritten August 11, 2016 - Wish I would have received an honest feedback about this \"retrait before\"...I was in Surya Muni Spiritual Healing Center for 6 nights, planned originally to stay for 10 nights. The reason for me to travel to specifically this retreat was, that the feedback on TripAdvisor from all travellers in terms of what they experienced was really good, and also in terms of value for the money invested. I really hesitated for a long time, if I should give my feedback, but as I wished, that I would have known before, I think it is my obligations to share my experience. First of all, do not expect a \"Spiritual Healing Center\". We talk here about Evi's home, where the \"program\" takes place in her private veranda, and a big room, that she added for Yoga and Meditation sessions. She is a nice elderly lady, who knows very well, to run this business profitably. I did communicate in advance, that the reason for me to visit and decision for Surya Muni was that I had a very difficult time, I am not a very spiritual person, with little experience in Buddhism, Meditation and Yoga, but really searching for the values in those, but I would need some guidance, which was happily confirmed by mail from Evi in advance. I found out later, that Evi's english level, is not very good, which makes a conversation or a deeper discussion impossible. Also the mails that I received under her name in perfect english upfront my visit were not written by her. If you are spiritual , the meditation and Yoga might me beneficial for you, the yoga teacher was a pro, if you are a beginner, do not expect any guidance, explanations or support. I did have the feeling, that some of the other guest did get something out good from them. Also the Karma and Chakra Healing was a strange experience. I wanted to believe and trust so much, but I honestly cannot say if this was all fake, a 30 minute ceremony, which I really do not want to get into here. I think you need to judge yourself, if this ceremony brings you healing. I was a little surprised, that for a non profit healing center, Evi expressed very clearly, that the Karma and Chakra (both in one session) healing ceremony would only take place, if all the open bills were paid fully in advance for the stay. I have a little bit of a problem to believe that my Karma will be healed, particularly from a Non Profit Center, which wants to help people, depends on money. The Bungalows and the rooms were about 10 minutes walk on the main street in a total run down resort. Also very noisy, as right next to the main street. I did expect simple but clean, but they were just disgusting, you would not want to touch anything. Smelly, totally run down, totally unacceptable. They were good enough, to bear it during the stay, but everybody I asked, felt extremely uncomfortable and disgusted by the rooms and bathrooms. Air condition did work in my room. The walk to Evi's place at 5.30 in the dark in the morning on a main street, with dogs barking, is scary and only bearable if you don't have to do this by yourself. The massage Salon was a typical Thai Massage Salon on the main street, about 20 minutes walking distance from Evi. Don't expect privacy and professionalism, but the lady's working there had fun, and the massages were really good. I think that Evi has some kind of cooperation with them, that she brings them clients. The beach is also about 25 minutes walking distance from Evi, and is not nice The sea is not clean and the public beaches are dirty. So don't expect much. The sun sets are though really nice in this location, and very enjoyable. I also did hope that there would be some group spirit and discussions, but there was not. Also there was not a daily program as stated in the internet. On the last day, I was by myself, and Evi spontaneously cancelled Meditation and the Yoga. I think that she didn't feel like doing it and paying the Yoga teacher only for one person. Instead she offered a going away ceremony, which took 5 minutes. One time Evi forgot to do the Meditation, as she got carried away talking. A little annoying if you get up to be there on time at 5.20. The food was very basic (don't expect anything close European or American Standard), but nicely cooked. If you don't want to eat much, and have very low expectations, you will be ok with it. All in all, I didn't want to leave upon arrival, as I was hoping that it would get better, and that I would get into the healing spirit, also through the support of Evi. Unfortunately it did not happen. I really sadly think, that this is a rib off on money, definitely not non profit and not a center, but if you all know this and are ok with it, and have a lot of spiritual experience, you might enjoy it. Do not rely on the pictures, they do not show the reality. For example, the pool looks great in the picture, but actually is totally run down, dirty surrounding with lots of trash and broken parts lying around, which is not enjoyable.I am always happy to get some feedback from my guests, so I can improve my service. But the feedback of my guest Heidi sent to tripadvisor, has nothing to do with critics, it is just diffamation and false remarks. Already from the beginning of her arrival, I got the feeling, there is trouble ahead. Heidi arrived late at 8:30 pm, my staff picked her up from the airport. Once she arrived at Suryamuni H.C. she totally freaked out and screamed all over the place, so my other guests got shocked, the reason was the airline lost her bag. After she tried to call different tel.numbers, using my phone. I told my staff to go back to the airport to look for her bag, at the airport they told my driver, that the bag was not lost, but she forgot to pick it up. I had to pay my driver for the 2 airport transfers. Meanwhile it was 2 am in the night. At 5:30 am the meditation started, so I could sleep only for 2-3 Hrs. As it is mentioned on the website and I made it very clearly in the mail before her arrival: \"Actually, Suryamuni is a small personal spiritual Healing Center for spiritual awareness and not a fancy wellness resort for' spiritual entertainment '. As a channel for the Divine, my destiny is to help people who are sick or looking for clarity about their true self. \" The Center is also the place I live, it is not true that the ' program ' took place in my private veranda and my English level is good enough, to understand that the word ' rib off ' you used, is written : ripp off I had a scholarship in America and I studied at NYC University when I was young, also I worked with tourists for about 35 years, so what are you talking about. But you are right as you said: \"the other guest did get something out good from \" the retreat. Everybody in the retreat enjoyed and I got a good feedback from all of them, except you. I didn't mentioned on my website, that Suryamuni H.C. is non-profit and sure I need some money to live on . I am supporting many dogs and people with no income don't have to pay for my healing service. It took you 3 days to pay for the retreat ( you told me you lost your credit card - which was one of your lies )and even I told you, if you don't feel comfortable, you are free to leave and I will return the money back to you. You told me, that you have been in Lipa Noi Beach before, in high-class hotels like Nikki Beach ( just a few hundred meters from my place ) and Hilton Hotel. So you knew very well about the area and the beach. Why you came back to the same beach if, like you said ( \"and is not nice The sea is not clean and the public beaches are dirty. So don't expect much \" ) You asked me already in the mail you sent before your arrival, about the weather and the beach and I told you in my mail ( \". Anyway, I can not give you a guarantee about the weather, clean beaches and water, but if you not feel comfortable about the beach, the resort or even me myself, you are free to leave, I will not charge anything. \" ) The bungalows ( Samui Cottage ) are only 5-6 min down the road, my staff Goong, picked you up early in the morning and I also gave you my mountain bike, so you didn't have to walk. The pictures of the resort, the pool and Suryamuni H.C. are real, not edited in Photoshop and done by a simple digicam. The bungalows are simple but clean ( not the same standard as in Hilton Hotel ), anyway not a reason to leave the Air-Con on the whole day, and to open the windows and door, as you did. For this price it is a good value. The massage I offered you to have in your bungalow, because more privacy, but you wanted to have the massage in the shop. The massage lady , Apple, is my friend and we work together for longer time, she is really good in doing Thai Massage. All my other guests enjoyed my food and everybody had enough to get full, no one ever had to leave my place hungry. This is Thailand and I am a Thai lady, that's why I cook and serve Thai Food and this is one of the best and healthy food in the world. Anyway, so far most of my guests enjoyed to stay here and people who are looking for ' Spiritual Entertainment ' are totally wrong in Suryamuni H.C.Written February 28, 2017This response is the subjective opinion of the management representative and not of Tripadvisor LLC.Visited February 2017Traveled soloWritten February 17, 2017 These reviews are the subjective opinion of Tripadvisor members and not of TripAdvisor LLC.

I didn't know what to expect, but came willing to embrace what ever came my way and I would recommend everyone who visits to be completely open, honest and to just go with the flow. Eve is a remarkable and very special lady and she made me feel like family. She is great company, the stories of her life are mesmerising, the conversation flowed and she has a great sense of humour. We laughed often and I truly feel that we are now friends for life. The previous Australian visitors (who Eve spoke very highly of) give a good description of the process so I won't go over similar ground. I have been practicing the mantras she has given me and although i've been sceptical of this type of thing in the past I'm now a convert! Afterwards I feel a deep sense of peace, and remarkably my symptoms start to dissipate. I'm not sure how it works but it does so I don't question it. Spending time with Eve is an experience that I will never forget and i'll be returning to visit my dear friend for dinner and to taste her amazing cooking at the first opportunity. Thank you Eve and Goong for everything. You are both wonderful special people and I hope to see you soon.

Jul 2019 Couples We found our way to Suryamuni and Eve without really knowing what to expect. Of course we had researched the many resort style retreats available and were drawn to the simplistic and authentic nature of Suryamuni Healing Centre. It is run by a warm-hearted Thai lady, Eve, from her home. She has three dogs that welcome you every morning, they are good dogs and are always welcome of some attention. Eve hosts her guests around her large table and recounts stories from her life and gets to know you through this informal way. From the beginning, Eve invites you to ask questions and to be open and honest; if you are inclined to approach your experience in this way then Eve's values and advice will be helpful for you. The detox 'cappuccino' takes your breath away and Eve advises you to take your time with it and is checking in with how you are feeling regularly. The yoga in the morning is invigorating and you can bow out without judgement at any time, Marina (the yoga instructor) checks in and guides your stretches with consideration to your needs. Next is breakfast, and after detox and the yoga, you will have the munchies! The breakfast is cooked eggs on toast, with fresh fruit and yoghurt and is just perfect for the occasion. In amongst this time, we discuss and write mantras, performing them when the group is up to it; sometimes you might feel weird in the body or be tired and so she will not press you to sit and perform the chants. It definitely has a flexible and 'flowy' feel to it so go with that and you'll have a great experience. The massages are great and are at a seperate massage parlour down the road. The rooms (down the road from the centre) are very simple, with working air conditioning, televisions and wifi. It's not flash but a good enough place to relax after sessions. We explored the other resorts around the area and paid to enjoy their pools and atmosphere when we needed to. All in all take it for what it is and enjoy.

Apr 2019 Solo I met Eve last year for a chakra cleanse. She was very accurate in all she told me without knowing much my past. The thing that intrigued me the most is when notified me that she could see a black spot in my uterus and it was growing. I followed her recommendations and seen my doctor once returned home; sure enough Eve was right. I was told I had a fibroid and it is growing. I visited Eve again this year and my only wish is I wish I visited her sooner so I could have done the detox. She is always welcoming and kind to me. I feel she is one of my guides to help me achieve my optimal physical and spiritual health. Looking forward to visiting her again.

Feb 2019 Solo If there were six stars I would give them! Thank you to Evie & Claus for an amazing experience. Should you be looking for a 5* Spa experience, this is not it. The time here is more important than anything money can buy & what you may be used to. It can be intense and you should be ready for that firstly. I believe everyone's experience will be different, Evie has a gift & this will depend on the person & what they require. Perhaps you will visit her first to discuss. But an open mind & heart is a must, no expectation. Personally I would have slept outside with the Dogs for this opportunity. I didn't care what type of room it was or for strict order, I went with the flow & it worked. This coming from someone who can be uptight & likes 5*! But in this position those things were irrelevant & I embraced it all. Meals were delicious. The 1-to-1 healing session is something that cannot be described as is personal to all. Yoga & massages good. And the detox tea, well it isn't tasty but it does the job. Lol. Claus was also so helpful & Welcoming. As a group we enjoyed some great unexpected afternoon trips. It was like a family. Thank you so much for this time which I will remember forever. I got much more from this than I expected and great value so all can enjoy, it is not a commercial money making enterprise. Evie does from the heart and that is felt.

Nov 2018 Solo I arrived to Evie at a time where I was burnout from working and living in an extremely stressful and toxic environment. My heart was bruised and I didn't know how to love myself the way I loved others..I was in a dark place...and then I was led across the world to visit Evie! A magical light was found within me...I have never taken the time for myself before: and here I was on a island: at a healing retreat, meditating, taking a detox tea, practicing yoga, having a karma cleansing...Who am I?!?! Evie is simply stated a magical soul! She made me see something in myself that I didn't know was there, she helped heal me on so many different levels, I am still understanding nearly 4 months later! It her love, her care, it's her delicious food, its her whole being that helped me to a lighter, brighter and happier place within myself! Surya Muni is place that you have to want to be at. For you. It is magical. It is everything I didn't I know needed and more! I am so eternally grateful that I was led to come here! Evie is simply stated a magical soul!

Dec 2018 Friends Eve is the real deal in the realm of healers and spiritual guides. I was skeptical, not wanting a charlatan or a commercial retreat site (covering expenses and keeping the lights on is fine with me however). She actually charged me *less* than the quoted amount we had agreed upon by email, throwing me into a tailspin of confusion! Her highest priority is the quality of her healing work, which is impeccable, with Klaus assisting. Second is logistics, so you may need to wait for your ride and the accommodations are comfortable and air conditioned but not luxury. The food is amazingly tasty vegetarian fare with egg and sometimes tofu. When my sister and I arrived, there were 2 other people receiving healing. The structure of the retreat was relaxed (morning coffee/mantra puja followed by yoga followed by breakfast, healing at midday if that's your day, otherwise free time until dinner, Thai massage whichever time you prefer to schedule it). I did not do a physical detox. I was profoundly surprised by sublime quality of the healing energy she invoked during my session as my expectations had been quite low. I received information to help me get deeply painful confusions in my life back on track and moved into clarity. The healing was likely one of the odder experiences of my life, but the proof is in the pudding and the pudding is excellent! Go to Evie and Klaus for healing if you are open to new and deep methods.

Oct 2018 Solo I came to Suryamuni with the objective to recharge, start anew and build a healthy habit before coming back to my old life in the city. I couldn't have made a better decision. My 5-day detox, healing and mantra proved to be very effective in attaining my goal. The detox concoction flushed out my bodily wastes and helped me lose weight without experiencing the mood swings and body aches I usually had with other weight-loss routines I have tried in the past. The yoga and body massage surely helped a lot, too. Most importantly, my one-on-one sessions with Mama Eve helped me clear my mind and focus on the task at hand one day at a time. It is essential to be open when coming to Suryamuni Healing Center. While it is not a place to solve whatever personal problems or issues one has, it is definitely a safe haven for \"learning by doing\". I achieved the kickstart I came for. Now, I am back in the concrete jungle with the lifestyle lessons I have learned from Mama Eve, armed with prayer, healthy routine and delicious vegetarian recipes! (Note: It is my 16th day on the routine I have learned at Suryamuni, and have already lost 8kgs in total. I am extremely overweight, so it might be different for various body types, and attitude. If YOU think this is for you, be open to change and embrace the daily routine. Good luck and God bless you.) - Joanne My 5-day detox, healing and mantra proved to be very effective in attaining my goal. The detox concoction flushed out my bodily wastes and helped me lose weight without experiencing the mood swings and body aches I usually had with other weight-loss routines I have tried in the past.

Jun 2018 Couples My partner and I visited Evie for two nights last month while on our Thailand travels. I was looking for a authentic spiritual experience and this is what I got. If your looking for a luxury retreat in a flash hotel this isn't it. Evie has the kindest heart and offers such beautiful wisdom and guidance. Her cooking is amazing! The massages were great. Go with an open heart and an open mind and the results will speak for themselves. My partner Lucas and I are so grateful for our experience here with Evie.

May 2018 Solo I am very grateful to have had the opportunity to receive a profound transformative spiritual healing from such an Amazing woman. Evie's incredible ability to channel the Divine connection for chakra healing energy, karmic release and the messages is truly an experience that I will not forget. As an Empath myself, I 'know' that The spiritual energy work that Evie does can be completely draining and tiring. However, Evie went over and beyond to see that I was getting the understanding and clearing that I needed at all times. Evie is a very heart warming beautiful person and anyone whom has the privilege to meet her is blessed . Evie is a genuine Spiritual channel and if you go to her with an open heart , listen to her words of wisdom and do what she tells you then you will get wonderful healing on many levels. I know I did! I got so much more than I expected in my experience. I came across The Suryamuni Healing Center whilst googling online and whilst I came across many others, I was guided (my intuition - I am a channel meself) to go to this one and I am so grateful that I did. I found the whole 6 day package to be of incredible value for money. ie; * my own little comfortable bungalow set in a beautiful area full of trees with the sound of birds to wake up to every morning. The pool was lovely too. * I had 3 yoga lessons with a super fit yoga teacher (kate). * I had 3 x 1hr. Massage sessions * I got to learn how to cook Thai food as I watched and took notes whilst Evie was preparing and cooking meals every night. * Evie prepared me a powerful spiritual cleansing detox every morning and night. * Evie taught me how to use the special mantras that were given to me during the healing ceremony. * klause took me out twice to a couple of tourist places and also a shopping trip. * I recieved a Divine Spirit Healing ceremony. (Chakra Healing and Karma Clearing and messages). * I also recieved on a daily basis, a wealth of Spiritual Wisdom, stories and insight from Evie. Just as a side note, I have pointed all this out because I see that there has been a few very foolish negative reviews here. I want to make it clear that Evie does not offer 5 star accomadation, nor does she even say that. The accomadtion is a little run down and old. However, it is completely clean with hot water, fresh bedding and very peaceful. I also see that these foolish negative reviews complained about the value. Well if you add up the - massage - 3 X b300 - yoga - 3 X b300 - 2 accom - b4633 - outside trips - 3 X b400 - cooking lessons - 4 X b200 - evening dinner - 5 X b200 - breakfast - 5 X b 150 - unlimited fruit - b350 - unlimited water - b200 - detox drinks - 10 X b50 Total so far is: approx b11233 These figures are all approximate and I have not included the Spiritual karma clearing, chakra healing, mantras or Evies spiritual wisdom, time and love. These gifts are priceless. However, I am sure you know that the average price for a spiritual healer (1 hour) is usually US $150 which is b4765 per hour.

Apr 2018 Solo I signed up for a 5 night programme at Suryamuni Healing Centre, and am very happy that I did. Evie is a special and gifted lady that can help anyone that comes to her with an honest and open mind. She loves to help people, and both her and Claus will look after you like you are family. I found that the programme offered the perfect balance of free time and scheduled items, for example massages and yoga. The nearby beach is peaceful, beautiful and clean. Evie's friends at the nearby massage place are lovely, and give a great massage and friendly service. Evie is also a very talented cook, I thoroughly enjoyed the meals she prepared! Having had the opportunity to learn how she made them, I look forward to trying to recreate them at home. If you are an animal lover, get ready to fall in love with her dogs, because they are angels! Evie is fun to spend time with, she shares great wisdom and also has a great sense of humour! Having left 4 days ago, I feel rejuvenated, relaxed, healthier, and am continuing to notice more benefits as time goes on. Thank you Evie and Claus for your kindness. I hope to visit you again some day. Written April 14, 2018 This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.
