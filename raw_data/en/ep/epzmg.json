Integrative medicine isn't meant to replace traditional medicine, but rather to enhance it with alternative and natural treatment methods. A wide variety of health conditions can be treated via [integrative medicine](http://www.alphacarewellnesscenter.com/IntegrativeServices.aspx#8858514306-services-offered) - including serious conditions such as cancer. This noninvasive treatment approach can be employed to complement conventional treatments such as chemotherapy, radiation, and surgery, by helping the side effects to be less noticeable or eliminated completely. Integrative Medicine Reduces Side Effects of Treatment The purpose of functional and integrative medicine is to identify the underlying cause of disease and to treat it at its root. Symptoms are therefore addressed as the disease itself is treated. For example, everyone's body reacts differently to chemotherapy. Therefore, an integrative healthcare professional who specializes in pharmacy can work with the patient's doctors to provide personalized [medications](https://alphacare.metagenics.com/) that are specific to the symptoms and the underlying conditions. Integrative medicine that accompanies conventional medicine is designed to not only treat disease and its symptoms, but also to avoid developing disease in the first place. Under the supervision and direction of a medical doctor, integrative medicine includes natural products and practices that treat both the mind and the body. Eliminating the Need for Surgery Doctors usually try noninvasive or minimally invasive techniques first, before recommending and implementing surgical treatments that will cause trauma to the patient. The noninvasive treatments involved in integrative medicine can allow patients to avoid heavy medications or surgery. Therefore, this natural approach is an ideal first line of defense for patients who may respond well to noninvasive measures. These measures are designed to foster natural healing properties within the body. In addition to medications and supplements, the patient's [doctor](http://www.alphacarewellnesscenter.com/MeetDrCatherineOseni.aspx) may also order massage and exercise (physical therapy) as appropriate. An experienced doctor knows how to best combine integrative and conventional medicine based on the patient's specific needs.
