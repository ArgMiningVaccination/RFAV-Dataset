Do's & Don'ts To maximise your results: - Do take a rest in between 28-day cycles - Don't take it continously Teatox is a 28-day program and not intended for long term use. Take a 4 to 6-week break in between 28 day programs for your body to rest and readjust after each detox. - Do drink your teas on your periods - Don't Teatox if you're pregnant The benefits of your tea come into play during periods when you're most likely to have food cravings, cramps or bloating. - Do eat your meals regularly - Don't starve yourself Teatox is not a diet or meal replacement. To maximise the effects of your detox, we recommend eating meals with lots of fruits and greens, lean meat and whole grains.
