Rand Road in Kildeer. In addition to residents of Kildeer and neighboring suburbs, members of the NCH Board of Directors and Foundation Board, medical staff leaders, physicians and local government officials attended the facility's open house. \"It was a night of great pride and excitement for NCH as we continue to grow and add services needed by our communities,\" says NCH President and CEO Steve Scogna. \"The incredible space along with the dedicated team members and physicians who work there truly embody NCH's mission and commitment to excellence.\" Physicians and staff welcomed attendees and provided information about the many healthcare services available at the center, including primary care, immediate care, cardiology, gastroenterology, endocrinology, neurology, diagnostic imaging, cardiac diagnostics, 3D mammography, lab services and physical therapy. Additionally, the event featured cooking demonstrations as part of NCH's joint initiative with Pritikin Intensive Cardiac Rehab at the Kildeer location. The comprehensive cardiac rehab program is the first of its kind in the Chicagoland area, helping patients receive support and assistance to make long-term lifestyle, exercise and diet modifications after experiencing a cardiac event. It includes medically supervised exercise tailored to each cardiac patient's fitness level along with engaging, Pritikin-exclusive workshops and cooking classes.
