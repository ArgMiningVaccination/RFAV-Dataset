Protocol, Facility, and Equipment Pharmacists who administer vaccines under this protocol shall maintain a current copy of this protocol at each location at which a pharmacist administers a vaccine and an appropriately private area for administering vaccines with the supplies and equipment listed in Appendix A. Version 1.1 0405 20 Page 3 VI. Informed Consent Before administering a vaccine, the pharmacist shall provide to the recipient or their legal representative information about the risks and benefits associated with the vaccination. A. Vaccine Information Statements. The pharmacist shall provide to each recipient or the recipient's legal representative a copy of the most current Vaccine Information Statement (VIS) for the vaccine to be administered. The recipient or legal representative shall be given the opportunity to read the VIS prior to administration of the vaccine and the pharmacist shall provide answers to any questions raised. Non -English speaking persons shall be provided a copy of the VIS in their native language, if available. B. Consent Form. P rior to vaccine administration, the pharmacist must document the informed consent of the recipient or the recipient's legal representative in writing. A sample consent form is provided in Appendix D. An equivalent consent form may be used. VII. Record A pharm acist administering a vaccine pursuant to this protocol must create a vaccination record for each recipient and must maintain this record in accordance with state and federal regulations. The record may include the Vaccine Administration Record in Appendix C or another record substantially equivalent. This vaccination record shall be readily retrievable and shall include the following: (a) The name, address, date of birth, gender and telephone number of the recipient; (b) A copy of the recipient's respo nses to eligibility questionnaires; (c) The name, dose, manufacturer, expiration date, and lot number of the vaccine administered; (d) The date of the administration of the vaccine and the injection site; (e) A signed and dated consent form; (f) A record of any adverse events or complications that arose following vaccination; and (g) A copy of the notification letter sent to the recipient's designated primary health care provider of the vaccine administered. VIII. Reporting As soon as reasonably possi ble following administration of a vaccine, the pharmacist shall report the vaccine administration to the statewide immunization registry ( IRIS ) or health information network and to the patient's primary health care provider, if known. Adverse Event Reporting - The pharmacist shall report any clinically significant event following vaccine administration to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System ( VAERS ) and the recipient's primary health care provider within 24 hours, even if it is not certain that the event was caused by the vaccine. Clinically significant events include, but are not limited to: death, hypersensitivity reactions, and those events described in the manufacturer's package insert as contraindications to additional doses of vaccine. IX. Vaccination Safety A. Infection Control and Sterile Technique . Each pharmacist administering vaccines shall follow appropriate precautions to minimize risk for spread of disease. Hands sh all be cleansed with an alcohol -based waterless antiseptic hand rub or washed with soap and water between each contact. Gloves shall be worn if the pharmacist administering the vaccine is likely to come into con tact Version 1.1 0405 20 Page 4 with potentially infectious body fluids or has open lesions on his or her hands. Needles used for injections must be sterile and disposable to minimize the risk for contamination. B. Prevention of Needlestick Injuries . To prevent inadvertent needle -stick injury or reuse, needles and syringes shall be discarded immediately after use in labeled, puncture -proof containers located in the same room where the vaccine is administered. Needles must not be recapped before being placed in the cont ainer. Safet y needles or needle- free injection devices should be used to reduce the risk for injury. X. Management of Adverse Events All vaccines have the potential to cause an adverse reaction. In order to minimize adverse reactions, recipients must be carefully screened for precautions and contraindications before the vaccine is administered. Even with careful screening, reactions may occur. These reactions can vary from inconvenient (e.g. soreness, itching) to severe and life threatening (e.g. anaphylaxis). If reactions occur, the pharmacist shall be prepared for their management. The procedures for managing adverse reactions are set forth in Appendix E. XI. Vaccines A pharmacist may order and administer US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved formulations of immunizations identified in section IV of this protocol, alone or in combination, provided they follow all requirements set forth in this protocol, assess patient eligibili ty according to indications, precautions, and contraindications recommended in current guidelines from the ACIP, and adhere to dosing and administration information provided by the manufacturer package inserts and ACIP recommended guidelines. A pharmacist should make a reasonable effort to ensure vaccination series initiated by the pharmacist are completed. Appendix F has additional information on dosing, injection route/site, directions for use, storage requirements, eligibility criteria, contraindication s, precautions, and any additional applicable information. Version 1.1 0405 20 Page 5 APPENDIX A REQUIRED SUPPLIES AND EQUIPMENT The following items must be available in the area where vaccines are administered: (1) A current copy of this Protocol. (2) The most current federal VIS for vaccines being administered. (3) Aqueous epinephrine USP (1:1000), in ampules, (i.e. EpiPen and Epipen Jr). The amount of epinephrine stocked shall be sufficient to allow for the pote ntial maximum number of doses prior to EMS arrival. (4) Diphenhydramine (Benadryl) injectable solution (50 mg per mL) and/or oral 25 mg dosage form, to include tablets, capsules or liquid. (5) Syringes: appropriate sized/type (e.g. filtered if using ampule s) for emergency supplies and the vaccinations on hand. (6) Alcohol swabs and bandages. (7) Blood pressure monitoring device or stethoscope and sphygmomanometer (with appropriately sized cuffs). (8) Appropri ate sized pocket masks with one -way valve. Version 1.1 0405 20 Page 6 APPENDIX B SCREENING QUESTIONNAIRE TO DETERMINE SAFETY OF ALL VACCINES Prior to vaccine administration, the pharmacist shall assess the safety of the vaccine for a patient using a general screen questionnaire which is at least sufficiently comparable to the Screening Checklist for Contraindications to Vaccines for Adults provided by the CDC. Vaccine specific screening questions must also be asked based on the vaccine's contraindications and precautions according to current ACIP guidelines and manufacturer's package inserts. The pharmacist shall document relevant responses and explanations provided in response to the screening questions. PRECAUTION Precaution must be taken before vaccine administration to a p otential recipient with moderate or severe acute illness, with or without fever. Vaccination should be delayed until the illness has resolved. REFERRAL A potential recipient with any contraindications and/or complex medical issues including immunosup pression or history of Guillain -Barr\u00e9 syndrome should be referred to their primary health care provider. LIVE VACCINES Prior to the administration of a live vaccine, the pharmacist shall ask a patient the following general screening questions, in additio n to the screening questionnaire used pursuant to Appendix B. Vaccine -specific screening questions shall also be asked based on the vaccine's contraindications and precautions according to ACIP guidelines and manufacturer package inserts. 1. Are you currently on home infusions or weekly injections mercaptopurine, antivirals, anticancer drugs or radiation treatments? 2. Have you received any vaccinations or skin tests in the past four weeks? 3. Have you received a transfusion of blood, blood products or been given a medication called immune (gamm a) globulin in the past year? 4.

Do not immunize a combative patient. Following vaccine administration, the pharmacist shall observe the patient for immediate adverse reaction(s) to the vaccine(s). If no reaction is immediately evident, request that the patient remain for observation for a period of 10 -15 minutes. If the patient displays any signs of any of the following reactions, the pharmacist shall execute the following procedures. If the patient experiences symptoms of a local reaction (e.g., minor pain, redness, warmth, pruritus, swelling at injection site ): Apply ice to the injection site Consider administration of an analgesic Observe the patient closely for 30 minutes, watching for generalized symptoms Make sure the patient has the telephone number of a provider to contact in case condition deteriorates. If the patient does not progress to any other symptoms, send patient home and contact patient 4 -6 hours later to assess recovery. If the patient becomes pale and/or feels faint , have the patient lie flat or sit in head down position for several minutes. If the patient loses consciousness, but has a steady pulse, normal blood pressure and respirations: Have the patient lie flat on their back with their feet elevated Have the patient rest in a quiet area for 30 minutes after regaining consciousness Notify the p atient's primary care provider about the incident Continue to monitor vital signs. If the patient remains unconscious for more than 3 minutes, CALL 911. If the patient's vital signs are abnormal (decreased blood pressure, increased or irregular pulse, etc. ): Place the patient flat on their back with their feet elevated CALL 911. If the patient experiences symptoms of an anaphylactic reaction (e.g., the sudden or gradual onset of generalized itching , erythema (redness) , or urticaria (hives) ; angioedema of lips, face, throat; bronchospasm (wheezing) ; shortness of breath ; shock ; abdominal cramping ; or cardiovascular collapse : If symptoms are generalized, activate the emergency medical system ( CALL 911) immediately (this should be done by a second pers on while the pharmacist assesses the level of consciousness, circulation, airway, and breathing of the patient) Place patient in a recumbent position and elevate the legs The first line therapy in anaphylaxis is epinephrine. There are no contraindications to epinephrine to 0.5ml, with maximum single dose of 0.5ml) If EMS has not arrived and symptoms are still present, the dose of epinephrine may be repeated every 5 to 15 minutes until emergency assistance arrives, depending on the patient's response Version 1.1 0405 20 Page 9 OPTIONAL TREATMENT: administer diphenhydramine (either orally or intramuscularly; the standard dose is 1 -2mg/kg every 4 -6 hours, up to 50mg maximum single dose). Do not attempt to give oral medications to a recipient who is not fully alert and able to swallow safely. Monitor the patient closely and check vital signs (BP, pulse, respirations) every 2 to 5 minutes. Stay with pa tient until emergency assistance arrives. If necessary, perform cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and maintain airway. Keep patient in supine position unless he or she is having breathing difficulty. If breathing is difficult, patient's head may be elevated, provided blood pressure is adequate to prevent loss of consciousness. If blood pressure is low, elevate legs. Record all vital signs, medications administered to the patient (including the time, dosage, response, and the name of the person who ad ministered the vaccine), and other relevant clinical information concurrently in an adverse reaction medication log to be maintained by the pharmacy, a copy of which may be provided to EMS and/or the patient's primary care provider. An Adverse Reaction Log form is attached as Appendix E. Notify the patient's primary health care provider as soon as reasonably possible. Each patient experiencing an anaphylactic reaction must be referred for evaluation, even if symptoms resolve completely. The pharmacist shal l also report the adverse reaction to the VAERS within 24 hours.

Administer 2 doses, at least 6 months apart. At least 1 dose should be given before travel. Consultation: Advise patients to wash hands frequently and avoid unsafe food and water. Hepatitis B Sexual contact, contaminated needles and blood products, vertical transmission Vaccination (3-dose vaccine): Recommended for all non - immune travelers, but especially those who are traveling to a country with hepatitis- B pr evalence 2% . Administer doses at 0, 1, and 6 months. Accelerated schedule is available. Consultation: Advise patient to practice safe sex and avoid contaminated needles and blood products. Typhoid Contaminated food and water Vaccination (with oral or injectable vaccines): Recommended for travelers going to a country t hat is endemic for typhoid. Administer injectable vaccine at least 2 weeks before travel. Complete 4 doses of oral vaccine (taken 2 days apart) at least 10 days before travel.

Rabies Saliva of infected animals Vaccination (3-dose vaccine): Consider offering vaccine to travelers to high -risk countries, who: Plan to spend a lot of time outdoors or in high -risk environments (such as adventure travelers or cavers). Will be handling animals (such as veterinarians, animal handl ers, field biologists, or laboratory employees working with animal specimens). Are children who may be at higher risk because they are more likely to approach animals and less likely to report bites. Will be traveling to rural areas (because treatment might not be available). Begin vaccine series at least 21 days before travel. Administer doses at 0, 7, and 21 days or 28 days. Consultation: Advise patient to avoid contact with animals. The risk of rabies is extremely small for travelers who know the risk, have a plan for getting care if they are bitten, and have travel health insurance to pay for treatment (and, potentially, evacuation to an area where treatment is available). Yellow fever Mosquito bites Vaccination (single -dose vaccine): Recommended for travelers Version 1.1 0405 20 Page 25 to certain parts of South America and Africa.
