During such stressful moments, the sympathetic nervous system in your body turns on, your heart rate goes up, fresh oxygen gets delivered to your brain, and an infusion of glucose is shot into the bloodstream for a quick energy boost. This state of adrenaline rush can help you perform better and increase your chances of succeeding. However, if you perceive this adrenaline rush as a negative, fear response, and avoid such situations, you may be creating missed opportunities. Inhale \"Time to Shine\", give yourself a boost of energy and confidence, and go shine! Customer Reviews [Write a review](#) I'm a trauma therapist and specialize in neurological and somatic trauma reprocessing. I use these inhalers in my office, to help clients (and myself) with mindfulness practices and grounding. They are so fabulously effective. Magic in a little tiny jar! I adore this inhaler! I use it as part of my morning routine and it helps me wake up on the right foot. "}
