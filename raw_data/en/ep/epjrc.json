It's called natural immunity ...", "sitename": "Dogs Naturally", "date": "2022-11-16", "cleaned_text": "Imagine avoiding the risks of the parvovirus vaccine while getting very strong immune protection. One of the top two potentially deadly diseases of puppies. How? Well, it's not only possible, but it's also been proven to work in the real world by holistic veterinarians. To Give The Parvovirus Vaccine Or Not? If you've decided that giving your puppy the parvovirus vaccine is best for him, that's ok ... but let's review how to do this as safely as you can. You need to make your own vaccine decision because, in the end, you're the one who has to deal with the consequences. What's crucial is that you decide based on science and not on a false belief - or fear. The fact is, you can't eliminate the risk for your puppy. You can only choose which risk you can accept. Parvo is very much like a deranged serial killer lurking ... - On every sidewalk - In the dog park - In every training class ... stalking puppies and claiming random lives. The best way to avoid serial killers would be to stay inside and never leave the house. That would definitely reduce your risk of being a victim. But in return, the price you pay is the quality of life. You'd miss out on walks in the park, nice dinners out or visits with family and friends. The vaccine decision is the same trade-off. If you vaccinate your puppy for parvo, you're reducing the risk he'll be taken from you by parvo. But it comes at a price. The price you pay is the risk of chronic disease, which also affects his quality of life. The risks of vaccination include: - Higher risk of cancer - Hypothyroidism - Allergies - Cushing's disease - Addison's disease - Bowel disease - Joint disease - Heart disease RELATED: [5 unexpected vaccine dangers ...](https://www.dogsnaturallymagazine.com/5-unexpected-dangers-in-vaccines/) [Parvo](https://www.dogsnaturallymagazine.com/parvovirus-part-iii/) is tragic when it hits ... but these diseases can be just as devastating. The number of dogs claimed by cancer alone far outweighs those claimed by parvo. Make A Parvovirus Vaccine Plan If you've decided you want to vaccinate your puppy you need a solid plan. You want a vaccine approach that avoids multiple boosters. Vaccines are always risky. So don't be afraid to question your vet about these 3 important factors... #1 One Antigen Only Finding a single vaccine is becoming harder each year. But it's important that there are as few antigens in the vaccine as possible. Reducing antigens will increase the chance that your puppy builds an immune response. It also reduces the risk of a sudden vaccine reaction. Before your puppy's appointment, ask your vet to order the CPV vaccine. It's made by [Zoetis and only contains parvo](https://www.zoetisus.com/products/dogs/vanguard-plus-cpv.aspx). If you have to buy the whole lot to get your single vaccine, then buy the whole lot. Give your vet permission to use it for other puppies and consider it a donation to a good cause. #2 The Timing Choosing the timing of your puppy's vaccine is key. Let's look at those Vanguard study results again. These vaccine studies show how titers have good predictive value. This gives you a guideline to follow when planning. I'll talk more about titers in the next section. You'll want to book your puppy's vaccine appointment at no younger than 12 weeks of age ... and ideally after 16 weeks of age. At 16 weeks he'll have the lowest risk of maternal antibodies interfering. Again, that makes it more likely that one vaccination will protect him. #3 Run A Titer To Check Immune Response There is a simple blood test that you can run called a [titer test.](https://www.dogsnaturallymagazine.com/titres/) A titer measures a small part of the active immune system. It tells you the number of circulating antibodies. If a titer is high, you can assume your puppy's immune system responded successfully to the antigen. After you've vaccinated your puppy at around 12- 16 weeks, run a titer 3 weeks later. Titer testing at this time will confirm if your puppy has built an immune response. If there's any amount of circulating antibody, no matter how small, then your puppy is protected for life. That means there's no need for further vaccination - ever. You must wait at least 3 weeks after vaccination before titering. The vaccine can inhibit titer levels until the immune system adjusts. The adjustment period can take 3 to 4 weeks. Despite what your vet may say, your puppy doesn't need a booster once he's protected. Immunity to viruses is an all-or-nothing thing. Just like chickenpox or measles, you're either immune or you're not. Some people developed their immunity through exposure and some developed immunity through vaccination. Either way, once you get either the actual virus or the vaccine, you're likely protected for life... and so is your puppy.

Feed The Best Diet You Can Poor nutrition lowers your dog's immunity and increases his risk of getting sick. So you need to [feed your puppy](https://www.dogsnaturallymagazine.com/how-did-it-get-so-complicated/) the best diet you can. NOTE: This doesn't mean the most expensive kibble money can buy. In fact, it means ... [avoid kibble altogether](https://www.dogsnaturallymagazine.com/kibble-never-a-good-option/). Food is medicine. Instead of filling your puppy with ... - Corn - Wheat - Baked and extruded slaughterhouse waste - Synthetic vitamins and minerals ... You need to provide him with [fresh raw, whole food diet](https://www.dogsnaturallymagazine.com/raw-feeding-primer/). Or at the very least, give him a home-cooked diet or a freeze-dried raw dog food. Kibble should be a last resort. Use Nosodes In Place Of Parvovirus Vaccine Avoiding vaccines will take big stress off your puppy's young immune system. Using nosodes provides him with some protection without the risks of vaccination. [Nosodes](https://www.dogsnaturallymagazine.com/nosodes-can-they-replace-vaccines/) are homeopathic medicines made from diseased tissue. Nosodes have a long history of providing protection against various diseases. They work especially well when given close to the time of exposure. After Dr Todd Cooney became a homeopathic vet, he switched from parvo vaccination to nosodes. The first improvement was no more anaphylactic reactions to vaccines. He no longer saw puppies develop hives or facial swelling. Dr Cooney's case records also showed some fascinating statistics. Here's how nosodes affected parvo survival compared to vaccines: Over an 18 month period, 275 puppies got wellness packages at the clinic. - 12 puppies caught parvo - 10 of the 12 survived (treated only with homeopathic medicines) 35 pups who did not get the wellness package caught parvo... - 20 survived - 15 died And here's the really interesting part... - Of the 30 puppies who survived parvo, only 6 (20%) were vaccinated. - 15 (50%) of the survivor pups had only nosodes. - Of the 17 puppies who died, 13 were vaccinated (76%). - Of the puppies who received only nosodes, none died. Vaccination lowered the puppies' survival rates, even when they got nosodes too. A small number of pups received vaccines first, then nosodes later: - 1 (3%) of the 30 survivors - 5 (29%) out of 17 puppies who died All pups received only homeopathic medicines for treatment. Nosodes are safe and easy to dose. And you can give them to your puppy much earlier than vaccines. Prevent Parasites It's important to make sure your puppy doesn't have a parasite overload. Parasites can strain his immune system and put him at a higher risk of getting sick. Parvo is also much more difficult to treat in puppies with parasites. However, this doesn't mean you should worm your puppy routinely. Conventional deworming can stress his immune system with toxins. Even herbal wormers can stress the liver and immune system. So it's best to treat only if there is a problem. Instead, you can run fecal exams. If he has parasites, then you can treat him. Gentler treatments can include herbs, diatomaceous earth and [certain foods that help eliminate parasites](https://www.dogsnaturallymagazine.com/everyday-foods-to-get-rid-of-dog-worms/). Only use more potent drugs if your holistic vet feels they're truly necessary. Socialize Wisely Last but not least, whether or not you vaccinate, be smart about where you take your young puppy. Every time your puppy leaves the house, he's exposed to small amounts of viruses. This builds his immunity, slowly and naturally. Don't expose him to an environment with large amounts of viruses. You'll want to avoid dog parks for this reason. It'll be too much for his young immune system. Most puppies' immune systems mature fully at around six months. Ironically, the most dangerous place to take any puppy is the veterinary clinic. Other than a shelter, there's nowhere that might expose your puppy more to parvovirus. And for the same reason, avoid training classes at the vet clinic. Working with a trainer at home is safest until he has better immunity. Feel Confident In Your Decision No matter which prevention route you choose ... I hope you feel that you've made the safest choice for your puppy.
