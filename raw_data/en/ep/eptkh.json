It's based on the belief that minimal doses of natural substances can help stimulate the body to cure itself. The natural substances, in larger doses, are typically known to cause symptoms in healthy people, but can be used in very small doses to treat similar symptoms. This is the homeopathic theory that, \"like cures like.\" Homeopathic medications are referred to as remedies. Homoeopathy is holistic and healing in that the treatment is directed to the affected part thereby when its function is restored the part will be in tact even without [medicine](https://www.speakingtree.in/topics/health/medicine) . In this context it is useful to know that every disease has a particular spectrum - from functional disturbance to the failure of the organ. One must adopt homoeopathy at the very first stage of functional disturbance because at this point of time, homoeopathy can exclusively be employed to heal the disease. As the stages advance in the given spectrum, exclusiveness will start reducing and some kind of support auxiliary means has to be utilized to bestow support from outside. Here are 5 groups of diseases which can be best treated and healed with homoeopathy:1. Auto-immune diseases: A disease in which the body's immune system attacks healthy cells. These are Rheumatoid arthritis, disease, Sjogren's syndrome, Ankylosing spondylitis, Alopecia, etc.2.

The process is Case-taking, Selection of Medicine, determination of potency with repetition and follow-up. Every step is vital in the treatment of the patient for a successful outcome. When a patient comes for the first time he or she needs about an hour or so to gather all the details pertaining to the condition of the patient which includes his personality, food habits, their cravings and aversions apart from the details of disease and all pathological reports. A regular follow-up is required so that every change can be studied and if need be changes in medicines or in its potencies may be advised. Necessary guidance about diet and life-style is also advised so that effective outcome is achieved. Many patients have a concern whether homeopathic treatment is safe. Yes, it is very much safe and any kind of patient may avail of the treatment. Some feel that homoeopathic medicines contain a large quantity of alcohol but it is not true. It may be noted that not even a drop of it goes into the patient. Hence there is no way homeopathic medicines will result in alcoholic toxicity or toxicity of any kind. There is a tendency among the people to Google every subject and homeopathy and it's remedies are no exception.
