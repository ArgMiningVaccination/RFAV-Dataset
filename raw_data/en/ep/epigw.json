Science is beginning to prove what the ancient Eastern medical traditions have been teaching for centuries. This unit aims to bring the science of Western medicine and the ancient Eastern knowledge together in the hope that practitioners can truly understand how to help their patients. In this unit you will learn about the early history of [naturopathy ](https://www.schoolofhealth.com/be-better/natural-health-definitions/naturopathy/)(early pioneers and influencers, different schools of thought, the rise and fall of naturopathy), naturopathy today, the therapeutic order, naturopathic philosophy (mechanism/reductionism), the vitalistic approach, the cause of disease, the microzyme theory of Antoine Bechamp, a healthy terrain, the role of other therapies such as Ayurveda, homeopathy etc. in naturopathy, naturopathic detoxification, naturopathic nutrition theory (stress, electrolyte balance, acute and chronic eliminations), naturopathic case-taking, naturopathic techniques (linseed tea, skin brushing, hot and cold showers, hot rubbing, Epsom salt baths, castor oil packs, enemas, liver and Gall Bladder flush, infra-red saunas), the healing crisis and the definition of functional medicine. A naturopath will give and suggest the least possible to bring the body back into balance. Unless we understand the healing power of nature, and the natural laws that we have learnt from Eastern medicine, we will always struggle to understand what our client needs in order to be able to return to health.

They are: healthy living, natural diet, detoxification, exercise, physical therapy and mental, emotional and spiritual healing, all using natural therapeutic agents.
