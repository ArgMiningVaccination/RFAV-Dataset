Stress, trauma, heredity, and our environment, can lower our resistance and we 'catch' something. Homeopathy is gentle, safe and effective. It is effective for acute illness and emergency situations. [Read my article of an older man recovering from shingles with Homeopathy here.](https://hpathy.com/clinical-cases/case-shingles-ursula-dobelmann/) Your symptoms and the way they uniquely affect you, is your immune system at work. Sometimes it needs some help. An individually selected homeopathic medicine, called a remedy, helps the immune system to accomplish the task of healing by supporting the healing effort rather than suppressing symptoms. During an acute illness, these are self limiting, infectious illnesses like colds, flu, food poisoning, stomach flu, pneumonia, childhood diseases, we cough, sneeze, blow our nose, vomit, have diarrhea, a rash, and a fever........ our immune system is at work to expel and kill the invader that has made us sick. Homeopathy is very effective to speed healing and lessen the intensity of the illness and often makes it possible to avoid anti-biotics, other medications and complications. In addition homeopathy helps to strengthen the constitution and helps us resist 'catching' something. Homeopathy also has great success with healing injuries like: wounds from cuts or dog / cat bites, spider bites, bee stings, broken bones, sprains, strains. Because homeopathy is based on the individual person and how you feel, we can get started immediately, even in cases where a diagnosis is not yet possible. The selection of your remedy is based on your symptoms, feelings, sensations, thoughts and how you are different since you started feeling sick, not a diagnosis. Homeopathy is a healthy wellness solution that addresses the cause of dis-ease to effectively assist the self-healing process for a return to improved health and well being so you can take charge of your life. How does Homeopathy help heal? [The individually selected homeopathic remedy acts as a stimulus for the innate healing system and like following a \"road map\" symptoms gently lessen. Health, balance, and well-being are re-established.](https://healthywellnesssolutions.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/bottle-diagrams.png) Homeopathic remedies are are made using repeated dilution and succussion (violent shaking) in what is called serial dilution. This makes them non-toxic, yet powerful, natural medicines, without side effects, gentle, safe and effective. Homeopathy has helped millions of people of all ages, from infancy to old age and during pregnancy. It has been in use for well over 200years with a wealth of documented success.
