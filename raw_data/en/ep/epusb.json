Aromatic herbs are always present in perfumes belonging to [the foug\u00e8re olfactory family](https://www.sylvaine-delacourte.com/en-int/guide/the-fougere-family), also known as the fern family. In perfumery, aromatic herbs are fresh and energizing raw materials. Aromatics herbs are classified in three main groups: - Lavender notes - Mint notes - Aniseed notes Aromatic herbs with lavender notes Some aromatic herbs have lavender notes. This is particularly the case for the following raw materials: - lavender - lavandin - rosemary - thyme - sage - mugwort Lavender Origins of lavender The south of France is the main producer of lavender. The term \"lavender\" comes from the Latin \"lavare\" which means \"to wash\". There are many different varieties lavender, such as lavandula stoechas, lavandula officinalis, lavandula spica. Lavender flower is a symbol of purity and tranquility. Treatment and manufacturing of the raw material It is possible to obtain lavender essence by [steam distillation](https://www.sylvaine-delacourte.com/en-int/guide/the-distillation-process), or lavender absolute by [extraction with volatile solvents.](https://www.sylvaine-delacourte.com/en-int/guide/extraction) Olfactive description of lavender Lavender has a herbaceous, camphorated, medicinal, and fresh scent. It has several facets, lavender exhale a note of bergamot, slightly floral, with woody tones. It is a powerful note that evokes gardens, summer, and the south of France. Some people may also find a vintage side to it, because it tends to recall beard soap, classic colognes, or even grandma's cupboards, where small bags of lavender were placed to scent the laundry. Note that it is the percentage of linalyl that will give it its olfactory quality. Usage of lavender Traditionally related to the fern family (foug\u00e8re family), lavender is also typical for [eaux de Cologne](https://www.sylvaine-delacourte.com/en-int/guide/eau-de-cologne) or [perfumes for men](https://www.sylvaine-delacourte.com/en-int/guide/choose-a-perfume-for-man), but it is also found in the composition of chypre or oriental perfumes, and now in some perfumes for women.

Harvested mainly in the south of France. There are 3 varieties of lavandin: lavandin grosso, lavandin abrial, and lavandin Super. It is the Grosso lavandin that is cultivated the most. Treatment and manufacture of the raw material Like lavender, lavandin essence is obtained through steam distillation. Olfactive description of lavandin More camphorous than lavender, lavandin is fresh, slightly woody, spicy, and has a less chic side than real lavender. Its scent is herbaceous and somewhat similar to soap, it's much more aromatic than lavender. Usage of lavandin Lavandin is mainly used for detergents and soap and generally in industrial perfumery. Rosemary Origins of rosemary Rosemary takes its name from the Latin \"rosemarinus\", which means \"dew of the sea\", because this plant was impregnated with the exhalations of the sea. Rosemary is native to the Mediterranean region. Treatment and manufacture of the raw material Rosemary essence is obtained by steam distillation of its leaves and flowers. Olfactive description of rosemary Rosemary is aromatic, fresh, herbaceous, camphorated, and woody in its evolution. Its scent is powerful, lavender, and bitter.

Usage of rosemary Rosemary is mainly used in aromatic perfumes, eaux de Cologne and perfumes for men. It is also found in citrus fragrances and in fresh notes more generally ( [cf. Facette nouvelle fra\u00eecheur](https://www.sylvaine-delacourte.com/en-int/guide/the-new-freshness-facet)).

Sage Origins of sage Sage is an aromatic plant of the Lamiaceae family, it grows mainly in Europe. This plant takes its name from the Latin \"salvare\", which means \"to save\". Several varieties of sage have medicinal properties. There are two main varieties of sage that interest us here: clary sage and sage that is used in particular for infusions and decoctions. There are many other species, but clary sage is the most used in perfumery. Treatment and manufacture of the raw material Two processes are used to obtain sage in perfumery, the most common is steam distillation, that gives sage essence. However, it is also possible to obtain absolute sage by extraction with volatile solvents. Depending on the part of the plant used, the result obtained will be different. Extraction with volatile solvents from balms, gums and resins will give sage resinoid, while extraction of all the other organs of the plant will give sage concrete. Olfactive description of sage Clary sage has an aromatic scent, animal, woody and earthy, but also floral, lavender, green, minty and camphorated. Usage of sage Sage brings an aromatic and tonic note to perfumes and is often used in perfumes for men. Clary sage, as an absolute, is sometimes used in the composition of chypre and oriental perfumes, although it is more traditionally associated with the ferns families. It possesses an extreme tenacity and is part of [ the base notes](https://www.sylvaine-delacourte.com/en-int/guide/base-notes). Sage can be used to obtain Ambrox, which makes it possible to replace ambergris in perfumes. It's rarely used in fragrances for women. Perfumes containing sage Here are some fragrances containing sage: L'heure bleue by Guerlain in its top notes, Polo by Ralph Lauren, Pour Homme by Van Cleef & Arpels, Dior Homme Artemisia Mugwort is an atypical plant, herbaceous perennial.

Mugwort is also present in the fragrance D\u00e9claration by Cartier and in Eau d'Armoise by Serge Lutens. Aromatic herbs with aniseed notes Among the aromatic herbs used in perfumery, some have aniseed notes. This is notably the case of: - basil - tarragon - star anise Basil Origins of basil Originally from India and Lebanon, basil was introduced in Europe in the 16th century. It is cultivated in Mediterranean countries such as in Egypt and Morocco. In the past, basil was strictly reserved for royal use in Ancient Greece and Rome. Indeed, \"basil\" originally means \"royal\". There are at least 6 different varieties of basil, each of which has a distinct smell. Most of the production of basil is located in Egypt, North Africa, Southern Europe (especially Italy), the United States, Madagascar, France and the Seychelles. Processing and manufacturing of the raw material The essential oil of basil comes from the fresh leaves of the plant. They must be dried before steam distillation. Olfactive description of basil Basil has a herbaceous, aromatic, and fresh scent, while having character, but also green, spicy, very aniseedy, and minty, which sometimes draws on lavender with woody nuances. It is a very lively and tonic scent. The variety of basil with large leaves exhales a scent of jasmine flower, liquorice and lemon. Purple basil has peppery accents. Usage of basil Basil essential oil is mainly used in fresh compositions or ferns. It is often associated with lemon or spicy notes. Basil can also be used for chypre structures. Basil essential oil reinforces the aromatic facet while bringing an aniseed touch to a perfume. The scent of the essential oil of basil is very far from the fresh plant, which can be disappointing for a beginner perfumer or a perfume enthusiast. Perfumes containing basil Here are some perfumes containing basil: Aqua Allegoria Men by CK, XY by Hugo Boss. Tarragon Origins of tarragon Native to Russia and the Himalayas, tarragon was introduced to Spain by the Moors. Most tarragon production is concentrated in France. Tarragon really became known in France in the 18th century. In Old French, tarragon was first called \"tarcon\" and then \"targon\". This word comes from the English \"tarragon\" which means \"dragon grass\". Treatment and manufacture of the raw material Tarragon essential oil is obtained by steam distillation of its leaves. Olfactive description of tarragon Tarragon has a green, aromatic, herbaceous, spicy and aniseed scent. Usage of tarragon Tarragon essence is used in fresh fragrances as a top note, often in combination with citrus. It can also be used with rose or cinnamon notes. One of the most common uses for tarragon remains the aromatic family, to bring an aniseed facet for example, or to reinforce the effect of hedione (a constituent of jasmine flower). Hedione is used a lot in perfumes for babies, children and teenagers. Fragrances containing tarragon Here are a few tarragon-based Orange Blossom Collection by Sylvaine Delacourte](https://www.sylvaine-delacourte.com/en-int/shop/perfumes/oranzo). Star anise Origins of star anise Originally from the Mediterranean basins (Egypt and Greece), star anise is mainly cultivated in Spain, Russia and Poland. Star anise comes mainly from China or Vietnam, but also from Cambodia, Laos or Japan. This variety is easily recognizable by its 8-pointed brown star shape. It is by the way the only dry aromatic note. It is very appreciated in cooking as well as for its medicinal virtues. Treatment and manufacturing of the raw material The essential oil of anise is obtained by steam distillation of the seeds. Olfactive description of anise Star anise has a scent similar to aniseed. It's spicy, strong, aromatic, fresh, and liquorice. However, star anise is significantly spicier, herbaceous and sweet, while the traditional anise note is greener, tart, and aromatic. It is a note that we often love or hate because it reminds us of pastis, a speciality of the South of France. It can put off some people because its aromatic character is of a great personality. Usage of anise Most often, aniseed essential oil is used in perfumery in the top notes for its freshness and green accents. Its scent, indeed, brings freshness and modernity, and allows to reinforce certain notes of the fragrance. This aromatic herb is often present in aromatic or chypre perfumes, as well as in perfumes for men. Its green, aromatic and spicy accents also accompany very well woody and aromatic compositions. Fragrances containing aniseed Here are some perfumes containing star anise: Collection by Sylvaine Delacourte](https://www.sylvaine-delacourte.com/en-int/shop/perfumes/ozkan). Aromatic herbs with minty notes In addition to the aromatic herbs with lavender and aniseed notes, we also distinguish aromatic herbs with mint notes, among which : - peppermint - spearmint Peppermint Origins of peppermint The peppermint comes from a cross between aquatica mint and spicata mint. It is difficult to establish precisely its origins, but it is assumed that this variety of mint comes from England. It was then imported to the United States at the beginning of the 19th century. Nowadays, its production is located in Europe, Russia, Bulgaria and China. According to the legend, the Greek god of Hell, Hades, fell in love with the nymph Mintha. His wife, out of jealousy, turned the nymph into a plant. Olfactive description of peppermint Peppermint is a cold, aromatic, fresh, slightly camphorated note. Its scent is also powerful, green, and mentholated with balsamic nuances. Usage of peppermint Peppermint can be used to reconstitute green or lavender notes. It is used in fresh perfumes, and is often associated with perfumes for men. It is sometimes found around peppery and spicy notes. Mint works particularly well in cosmetics, but also in candles.

Fragrances containing spearmint Guerlain's Aqua Allegoria Herba Fresca. Other aromatic notes Absinthe Origins of absinthe This powerful herb has a large rhizome and grey-green leaves. It is native to Europe and Russia. Discovered by the Egyptians in 1600 BC, it takes its botanical name from a legend according to which the goddess Artemisia would have worshipped this plant, thus giving it its name. The culture of absinthe is not specific to a particular country, but is practiced in rocky and slightly sunny regions. Treatment and manufacture of the raw material The essence of absinthe is obtained by steam distillation (a technique discovered during antiquity and still perpetuated in Grasse). Olfactive description of absinthe Absinthe is an aromatic herb that can be fresh, minty, bitter, aniseed and slightly woody. Its scent is more distant from the smell of the drink, that is more tonic, strong, and more aniseed in its evolution. Usage of absinthe Absinthe is mainly known to be a popular drink of the 19th century, which Verlaine and Rimbaud loved. Forbidden in many countries since the 20th century because of the thujones that can make it dangerous to the nervous system, it is now again authorized in certain countries. In perfumery, absinthe is mainly used for the perfumes of the fern or aromatic family, and for green notes.

At that time, perfumers began to incorporate synthetic ingredients into their formulas, which amplified the palette of the professional, offering them more creativity. It also allows for more abstract olfactory forms. Today, chemists are able to isolate aromatic compounds from a natural raw material, purify them and obtain the molecular structure of the raw material. Once this structure is identified, the specialist will be able to use organic chemistry to recompose the molecules. As pictorial art has acquired a new dimension with synthetic dyes, perfumery has reached new heights and has allowed new scents with synthetic products.
