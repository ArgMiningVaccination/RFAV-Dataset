I also briefly touched upon my digestive and energy struggles, but did not share a lot of details until now. As some of you knew from seeing the bandages, in the summer of 2014 I experienced three very serious mountain biking accidents\u2014one of which knocked me unconscious. (To this day, I don't know exactly what happened other than I was riding downhill....and then I woke up face down in the dirt. I jokingly refer to it as my \"alien abduction\".) The serious trauma to my body from the crashes, combined with the need for pain relief (lots of ibuprofen) to get through them, pushed my body seriously out of balance and for much of 2014 & 2015 I suffered with my health for the first time in my life. I called upon my tried and tested \"tools\" (the ones that I used to help my patients, friends, and family with great results), but just couldn't seem to get a handle on my own symptoms. I felt frustrated, scared, and confused. The bike crashes, and the resulting physical symptoms, forced me to literally stop moving. I began to look at my whole life, including the pace at which I was living and the foods I was consuming to sustain that pace. I was doing everything too intensely: moving way too fast, pushing far too hard. Unlike me, Debbie's [health problems](https://mindfulfamilymedicine.com/conquering-crohns-disease/) began when she was young. After healing herself in her early 20's and then experiencing many years of great health, Debbie developed a second [autoimmune disease](https://mindfulfamilymedicine.com/debbies-journey-with-thyroid-disease/) after our daughter's birth. The demands of pregnancy and motherhood took its emotional and physical toll on her body. It was because of our combined struggles that Debbie and I embarked on this healing journey together. A decision to essentially go back to the beginning, back to the basics, and learn about the foundational building blocks of optimal health. My personal results can be read in the [post](https://mindfulfamilymedicine.com/clean-in-16/) I wrote in December (in summary: 20 lbs. weight loss, improved vitality and energy, freedom from my dependence on caffeine and sugar...). Although my digestive issues had improved quite a bit, I was still symptomatic from time to time. This ongoing struggle with my own symptoms really enabled me to feel compassion in a way I hadn't previously. Compassion for myself as well as for many of the clients and families I work with who, despite their best efforts, experience lingering health challenges. I stayed committed to a modified cleanse diet, while maintaining all the foundational basics, and have now steadily and significantly improved in all areas. I feel better than I have in 15-years! (This is a strong but true statement to be making at the cusp of my 44th birthday!) Similarly, over the last year I've watched Debbie come back into the vital, energetic being that she always was. By learning you will teach; by teaching you will learn. -Latin Proverb Debbie and I both became committed to sharing and teaching others about the tools that we used to bring health back in to our own lives. We launched our first program in January and the results were astonishing. People experienced many of the benefits we had felt ourselves and knew were possible\u2014some in just 3 weeks time. Participants enjoyed weight loss, resolved digestive issues, improved energy, and improved sleep. They were able to cultivate a more mindful relationship with food, and freedom from addicting foods..... to name just a few. Several participants have told us that they continue to follow the practices because they feel so good. Although we teach many of these principles to our clients and patients in the office, the cleanse format allows for so much greater detail, longer time and an invaluable first-hand experience in a supportive environment. What started out as a healing journey for me and Debbie has lead us down a new path that we feel honored to be able to share. We hope you join us for our upcoming Eating Clean Program\u2014and that you too will experience a more mindful, vibrant and healthy life as a result.
