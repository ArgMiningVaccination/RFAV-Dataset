When the body stops producing the pigment melanin responsible for the dark colour of hair, it turns grey. We can't stop time, no matter how much we wish, especially when it comes to age. The two most evident signs of ageing are the sagging of skin and the greying of hair. While the appearance of grey hair in mid-40s is only natural, in 20s and 30s it's a nightmare! When the body stops producing the pigment melanin responsible for the dark colour of hair, it turns grey. Although lack of nourishment and heredity are major reasons for greying, it could also be due to excessive use of tobacco, and smoking or emotional stress. Here are a few home remedies to battle greying hair.1. Amla (Indian gooseberry) A natural astringent that helps retain hair colour. What to do: Smash the amla, take the seeds out and make a paste. Apply it to your scalp and massage it on hair roots. 2. Coconut oil and lemon juice Helps improve blood circulation in the scalp. Oils contain biotin, moisture and other extracts that help in treating grey hair and making them soft. What to do: Mix two parts of coconut oil and one part lemon juice. Massage the mix thoroughly on to your scalp and hair. 3. Curry leaves Strengthen hair roots and provide vitality to hair. What to do: Boil the leaves in a tablespoon of coconut oil until charred. Strain and massage into hair. Leave it on for 30-45 minutes before rinsing it out. Follow this treatment at least twice a week. 4. Tea or coffee Keep hair black or brown naturally. What to do: Add tea or coffee to water and boil for 10 minutes. To retain black hair colour, rinse with tea and for brownish hair, rinse with coffee. 5. Black sesame seeds Turns greys to natural black. What to do: Eat raw black sesame seeds daily with water on an empty stomach. 6. Black strap molasses Prevents and reduces grey hair. It is rich in copper, which helps with the production of hair pigment. What to do: Eat a tablespoon of it every morning for at least a few months to see positive results. 7. Onion paste Nourishes hair. What to do: Apply and wash after an hour and grey hair will eventually turn black. 8. Rosemary and sage Both herbs cover greys by darkening hair colour. What to do: Boil one-half cup of dried rosemary and sage in two cups of water. Let it sit for a couple of hours. Strain and after shampooing, apply for 15-20 minutes and rinse. Repeat every week. 9. Amaranth Helps hair retain its black pigment and promotes hair growth. What to do: Grind the leaves of amaranth and apply on your scalp as a paste. 10. Shikakai An effective home remedy to treat premature greying. What to do: Soak shikakai in water in an iron vessel at night. In the morning, boil the water and rinse. Do this regularly.
