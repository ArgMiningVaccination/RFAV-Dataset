A new method for the identication of TCM constitution in clinics is proposed, which is trying to solve the problem like shortage of TCM doctor, complicated process, low eciency, and unfavorable application in the current TCM constitution identication methods. Methods. )Z_he corresponding eective samples were formed by sorting out and classifying the original data which were collected from physical examination indexes and TCM constitution types of 950 physical examinees, who were examined at the aliated hospital of Chengdu University of TCM. )Z_he BPNNalgorithmwasimplementedusingtheC#programminglanguageandGoogle'sAIlibrary.)Z_hen,thetraininggroupandthe test (validation) group of the eective samples were, respectively, input into the algorithm, to complete the construction and validationofthetargetmodel. Results.Forallthecorrelationmodelsbuiltinthispaper,theaccuracyofthetraininggroupandthe test group of entire physical examination indexes-constitutional-type network model, respectively, was 88% and 53%, and theerrorwas0.001.Fortheothernetworkmodels,theaccuracyofthelearninggroupandthetestgroupanderror,respectively,wasas follows: liver function (31%, 42%, and 11.7), function (41%, 38%, and 6.7), blood routine (56%, 42%, the Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) concepts, a person's constitution refers to such inherent qualities thatarecomprehensiveandrelativelystableinthemorphological structure, physiological functions, and psychological states, which are formed during one's life on the basis of naturalendowment and postnatal maintenance, which are personalfeatures adaptingto natural and social environment formedin the growth and development process of human [1, 2].Numerous classics of TCM explain the theories of TCMconstitution. It is recorded that \"people here are living thesame life, with the same age and the same clothes.

In another work by Wang, who is the founder of the TCMConstitution and master of Chinese medicine, the XT_heory of TCMConstitution,whichsummarizesandextendstheTCMconstitution,itisproposedthatlotsoffactorscaninfluenceahuman's constitution such as natural factors, age, gender, spirit, diet, living condition, and geographic environment. [1]. According to the basic theory of TCM and clinicalsurvey, Wang also proposed the classication of nine kindsof TCM constitution, which are peaceful type, qi-decienttype(qiisthevitalenergythatrunsthroughahumanbody),yang-decienttype(yangreferstotheheatandenergythatahuman body possesses), yin-decient type (yin is the op-posite of yang, referring to the body fluid that cools andquiets a body), phlegm-damp type, damp and hot type,blood stasis type, qi depression type, and special type [4].TCMtheorybelievesthatanindividual'sspecialconstitution can cause him/her to be particularly sensitive to some diseases, and such particularity of an individual's consti-tution will directly aect the onset and progress of a disease[5]. )Z_herefore, it is necessary for disease preventive treat-ment to prevent disease onset and exacerbation by dis-tinguishing constitution.

Nowadays,humancanlivelongerthanbefore.However, stress from job and life is increasing, which causes manypeople to fall ill [6]. Physical examination is becoming animportant approach to diagnose and prevent diseases.Physical examination indexes are the quantitative indexesused by Western medicine, which employ multiple physicaland chemical parameters such as blood routine indexes, urine routine indexes, liver function indexes, and renal functionindexes,toindicatephysicalconditionsofaperson.IntheeldofTCM,identicationofconstitutionisthebasisfor formulating individualized preventive and health caremeasures, and it is also the prerequisite for getting rid ofsubhealth status and realizing \"treatment without disease\"[7,8].)Z_hecurrentTCMconstitutionidenticationmethodsincludeTCMdoctors'articialidentication,geneclassier,meridian thermal sensitivity measurement, pulse wavefrequency-domain analysis, and scale method. All themethodsabovehavebeenprovedtohavesomeproblems:(1) the articial identication of TCM doctors is susceptible to the doctor's theoretical level and clinical experience andfaces the shortage of TCM doctors, which cannot meet theneeds of constitutional identication. (2) )Z_he cost andtechnical requirements of genetic classication, meridianthermal sensitivity measurement, pulse wave frequency-domain analysis, and other identication methods are high.Somearestillintheexplorationstage.Soitisnotconduciveto popularization and application [9, 10]. (3) )Z_he scalemethod, organized to form and administered by the StateAdministrationofTCMofthePeople'sRepublicofChina,iscompiled by the China Association of Chinese MedicineConstitution Branch. In 2009, the document \"TraditionalClassication and Judging Standards for TCM Constitu- tion,\" which guides and regulates the research and appli- cation of TCM constitution, was published [11]. Althoughthe scale method has been widely used, some experts haveproposedthatthescalehastheproblemsoftheabolishmentofobservation,auscultationandolfaction,andpalpationandpulse feeling in the TCM constitution identication, whicharecalled\"thediagnosisofWang,Wen,andQie\"inChinesemedicine and the loss of the overall concept of Chinesemedicine[12-15].)Z_herefore,partsofhospitalsactuallycarryout the constitution identication by combining the scalemethod with the three clinical diagnosis methods of TCM. In this situation, the process of TCM constitution identi- cation goes through two stages, from the independentdiagnosis to the comprehensive analysis, which has theproblems of complicated process and low eciency. At thesametime,thescaleissusceptibletosubjectivefactorsofthetester[16].)Z_hus, it isquitenecessary toexplore anewTCMconstitution identication method. In this situation, it proposes the research based on the integrative between Chinese and Western medicine, forwhich it uses BP articial intelligence neural network(BPNN)technologyandthesamplesfromclinicalofhospitalto establish the network model of physical examination indexes and TCM constitution. In the correlation network model, the TCM constitution is quantitatively analyzed byphysical examination indexes. It provides a new approachfor the identication of TCM constitution, and it may beexpectedtoavoidtheexistingproblemofTCMconstitutionidentication at present. )Z_heremainderisorganizedasfollows.Section2reviews research eorts on correlation between TCM constitutionandphysicalexaminationindexesandidenticationofTCMconstitution. Section 3 describes the study method onbuilding the correlation model. In Section 4, the proposed model for TCM constitution and physical examination is assessed in multiple clinic experiments, and various nu-merical results are presented and discussed. Finally, Section5 concludes and discusses future extensions. 2.Related Work )Z_here were some recent researches about the correlationbetween TCM constitution and physical examination in- dexes. For example, Deng and Lu made combined analysis over physical examination indexes and constitutional typesthrough clinical study and application, aiming to providebetter regulation solutions for patients [17-20]. Usingphysicalexaminationindexesandconstitutionaltypesof331community elderly, Ren and Li from Beijing ShijingshanDistrict TCM Hospital performed a correlation analyticalstudy, from which some conclusions that can guide clinicalpractice are drawn [21]. )Z_here are some other correlationresearches, such as combined analysis over TCM2 JournalofHealthcareEngineeringconstitution and physical examination indexes through dierent diseases like obesity, cerebral apoplexy, and hy-pertension.Withstatisticalorregressionanalysis,theymadethe similar conclusions that some constitution types cor-related with physical examination indexes were associatedwith a certain disease [22-32]. All the above studies showthat there is a certain correlation between physical exami-nationindexesandTCMconstitution.Buttheyonlyfocused on the correlation between some physical examination in- dexes and some physical constitution types by using tra-ditional methods of data statistics and analysis. )Z_he aboveresearch is not only lacking in the overall situation but alsohas not provided a template for the correlation betweenphysical examination indexes and TCM constitution. In view of the problems existing in TCM constitution identication methods, there were also some studies onidentication of TCM constitution in an automatic way.Zhang et al. proposed the design and implementation of anidentication system for TCM constitution, which imple- mented the electronic questionnaire of identication for TCMconstitution[33-36].)Z_hismethodisbasedonthescalemethod mentioned above. In practice, one's constitutiontypeisidenticationcombiningtheresultofthesystemandthe TCM doctors' articial identication, whichcauses Liang automaticidentication system of TCM constitution based on facialimage features. According to the result of facial diagnosis,which is done by the system with digital image processingtechnology, TCM constitution can be distinguished auto-matically. However, the accuracy of the result is not high. Meanwhile, the study selected fewer facial features, and the selected features did not fully represent a person's consti-tution type [37]. Hong et al. proposed an approach foridentication of TCM constitution based on the tonguemanifestation [38]. Yet it depended on tongue diagnosiscombining with questionnaire analysis, which is still inexploration. Bai proposed a way to distinguish TCM con-stitution based on BPNN [39]. For this approach, the TCMconstitution was identied by combining inspection, in-quiry, and palpation, which was more objective andintelligent. But the accuracy still needs to be enhanced, andits practicability remains to be veried. Xie proposed therealization of a platform for the identication of TCMconstitution and data analysis, by which it could completeTCM constitution identication based on scale and tonguediagnosis and provide the function of data analysis. How-ever,theanalysisalgorithmadoptedinthisstudywillleadtothe platform speed being too slow. )Z_he tongue diagnosis analysis algorithm cannot accurately analyze the tongue image, and the accuracy of TCM constitution identicationremains to be questioned [40]. )Z_he previous studies are short for eciency, accuracy, andcorrelationtemplate.Asabove,itisexpectedtoprovidea new approach for TCM constitution identication byconsidering the correlation between TCM constitution andphysical examination indexes with overall view and con-structing a correlation model. With the rapid developmentof articial intelligence and machine learning technology, itis a new trend to employ machine learning and neural network in TCM for automatic and smart identication of TCM constitution. Products such as smart medical equip-ment, intelligent diagnosis and treatment, and intelligentimagerecognition,whichhaveachievedrapiddevelopment,have been successfully applied in various elds. So, in thispaper, it explored the approach with BPNN, to implementthe identication of TCM constitution and to build thecorrelation model between TCM constitution and physicalexaminationindexesfrom950physicalexaminees.)Z_hedataaboutphysicalexaminationindexesandTCMconstitutionaltypes of the physical examinees were rst collected and sortedout.)Z_hephysicalexaminationindexeswereclassied into four categories, namely, blood routine indexes, urineroutine indexes, liver function indexes, and renal functionindexes.)Z_hesefourcategoriesofindexescombinedwiththecorresponding TCM constitutional types of physical ex-aminees were the original sample data. )Z_he eective data,obtainedfromproperorganizationoftheoriginaldata,wereinitially divided into the training group data and test groupdata. Furthermore, the training group data were input intothe BPNN, which was trained to establish physical Blood routine indexes Urine routine indexesRenal function indexesLiver function indexes ... Hidden types and physical examination indexes.JournalofHealthcareEngineering 3examination indexes-TCM constitution-type network model. Finally, the test group data were input to verify theaccuracy of the established neural network model. After theveried experiment, the accuracy of the training group andthetest group was upto 88% and 53%, respectively,and theerrorwascloseto0.001.)Z_herefore,thisresearchprovidesan automatic model to correlate physical examination indexes and TCM constitutional types, so as to use quantitativeindexesofWesternmedicinetorealizeautomaticandsmartidenticationofTCMconstitutionandtoprovideanewwayfor TCM constitution identication. )Z_he comparison between the previous studies and methods and the proposed method for constitution iden-tication of TCM is shown in Figure 2. )Z_he key contributions of this paper are summarized below: (1) Anewapproachtostudyingthecorrelationbetween TCMconstitutionandphysicalexaminationindexesis rstly proposed. BPNN algorithm is applied tobuild the correlation model, in which physical ex-amination indexes are the inputs, TCM constitutiontypes are the outputs, and Sigmoid function is theactivation function. )Z_hen, it comprehensively ana-lyzes the correlation of the two mentioned beforeand provides an automated relevance template. (2)A new method for identifying TCM constitution isproposed. It is successfully to construct a correlationmodel between physical examination indexes andTCMconstitution.)Z_hemodelisveriedbyexperimentwithhighaccuracyandlowerror.Itprovidesasmarterandmoreautomaticwaytorealizetheidenticationof TCMconstitutiontypes compared tothecurrent ways including doctor and questionnaire. 3.Study Method Neuralnetworkisalarge-scaleparalleldistributedprocessorcomposed of simple processing units, which has charac-teristicsinstoringexperientialknowledgeandavailability.Itis similar in two ways to human's brain [41]: (1) Neural network acquires knowledge by learning from external environment. (2) )Z_he strength of interconnection neurons, the syn- aptic weight, is used to store acquired knowledge. BPNN algorithm is a kind of articial neural network technology that is intuitive, easily understood, and widelystudied and used, with a powerful ability of nonlinear mapping and self-learning [42, 43]. It is also a kind of multilayeredneuralnetworkthatcanbetrainedtolearntheappropriate internal representations to allow learning anyarbitrary mapping from input to output. A typical BPNNconsistsofthreelayers,i.e.,input,hidden,andoutputlayers,which are closely connected to each other [44]. )Z_he learning process of BPNN is composed of forward propagationandbackpropagation.Intheforwardpropagationprocess, the result is transmitted to the output layer after thedata from the input layer are processed by neurons of hiddenlayer.)Z_hestatesofneuronsineachlayeronlyinfluencethestateofneuronsinthenextlayer.)Z_heprocessofbackpropagationisstarted, while the computational output is not equal to theexpected output. In the backpropagation process, error signalfromanoutputlayerispropagateduptoaninputlayerviathehidden layer, and the link weight and oset are adjusted throughout theway.)Z_hisprocessisnished untilthe accuracy reaches the requirement of algorithm. In fact, the BPNN al-gorithm aims at calculating a minimum error function. Byrepeatedtrainingofmultiplesamples,BPNNadjustsweightina negative gradient of error function till the error converges tothe least [45]. Based on the above theories, we adopted BPNN to es- tablish the correlation model between TCM constitutionaltypes and physical examination indexes in this work. )Z_he eective data were sorted out from original data collectedfromthesubjects,and80%ofwhichwasinputas traininggroupdataintotheBPNNtoestablishthemodel. )Z_he physical examination indexes in the test group data,accounting for 20% of the eective data, were input intothe network model to predict the corresponding TCMconstitutional types. )Z_he reason for such percentage al-location will be discussed later. )Z_he eective data, whichwere randomly divided into the training group and thetest group, covered the nine constitutional types of TCMas mentioned before. 3.1. TCM Constitutional Model Algorithm. )Z_he modelforcorrelationbetweenTCMconstitutionaltypesandphysical examination indexes is shown in Figure 3. )Z_hedetailed description of the algorithm is as follows. In this model, it took physical examination indexes as inputandTCMconstitutiontypesasoutput.)Z_heweightfromthe input layer to hidden layer was denoted as ijand that fromthehiddenlayertooutputlayerwasdenotedas jk;the oset k. study chose Sigmoid function (S-function) as theexcitationfunctiontoestablishthecorrelationmodelandto realize conversion of variable data and weight. BecauseS-function isnonlinear, its parameter values needto be in [0,1], and the physical examination index can easily satisfy thiscondition. )Z_he equation of S-function is shown as follows: g (x)1 1+ex.

PriortoapplyingTCMconstitutionaltypedatatoneural network algorithm, the TCM constitutional types should bestandardized.

Con-version standards are shown in Table 1. )Z_he physical examination indexes were also normalized bythecustomalgorithmwhichwasnotdepictedowingtoitssimplicity. As the Sigmoid activation function discussedabove is valued within [0, 1], the physical examinationindexes have to be normalized so that the values are within[0, 1]. 4.Experiments and Results 4.1. Data Collection. )Z_he 950 physical examinees, accepted bythehealthmanagementcenterofthealiatedhospitalofChengdu University of TCM from January 2016 to March2017, were used as study objects. Due to the security andcondentiality of the data, it took about 7-8 months to manually collect data, to entry data, and sort out data. )Z_he collected original data were cleaned, classied, and orga-nized to size ratios of trainingovertesting,i.e.,95%:5%,80%:20%,60%:40%,and50%:50%,respectively. )Z_he results indicated that when training groupdata: test group data 80%:20%, the network model has the highest accuracy and the lowest error. )Z_herefore, this studyapplied this percentage allocation to establish and verify the network model. Blood routine indexes of 383 physical examinees, urine routine indexes of 186 physical examinees, liver function indexesof564physicalexaminees,renalfunctionindexesof313 physical examinees, and entire physical examinationindexes of 133 physical examinees, as well as those physicalexaminees' corresponding TCM constitutional types, wereusedaseectivedata.80%oftheeectivedatawasregardedas training data, while 20% was regarded as the testing data.Allthesamples,traininggroup,andtestgroupdatacoveredthenine TCMconstitutionaltypes.Forexample,inthedata samples of blood routine indexes, the distribution of TCM constitutional types is as shown in Figure 5.

Accuracy and Error Results. Accuracy and error are essential to verify the prediction data of a network model. )Z_he algorithm in this paper employed the blood routineexamination, urine routine examination, liver function in-dex, renal function index, and entire physical examinationindex data of training groupto establish theneural networkmodel and then used the test group data for model veri-cation. )Z_he accuracy represents the ratio of the modelpredictionresultstotheactualresultsofthesample,andtheerror is calculated by the BP neural network algorithm, asshowninequation(4).IftheaccuracyishigherandtheerrorJournalofHealthcareEngineering 7is lower, the similarity between the predicted results of the modelandthetrueclinicalresultsishigher,whichindicatesthat the model has a higher availability.

From Table 2, the following could be obtained: )Z_he training group and test group of liver functionindexes-TCMconstitutionhaveanaccuracyof31%and42%, respectively, and the error is 11.7. )Z_he training group and test group of renal function indexes-TCMconstitutionhaveanaccuracyof41%and38%, respectively, and the error is 6.7. )Z_he training group and test group of blood routine indexes-TCM constitution have an accuracy of 56%and 42%, respectively, and the error is 2.4. )Z_he training group and test group of urine routine indexes-TCM constitution have an accuracy of 60%and 40%, respectively, and the error is 2.6. )Z_he training group and test group of entire physical examination indexes-TCM constitution have an ac-curacy of 88% and 53%, respectively, and the error is0.001.It is concluded that the more the physical examination indexes are, themoreaccurate the correlationmodel is,andthe lower the error is.

And the data in the test group wereused to verify the model. )Z_he results indicate that the morethe physical examination indexes are,the more accurate themodel is, and the lower the error is. For the entire physicalexamination indexes-TCM constitution correlation model,the training group and test group have an accuracy of 88%and 53%, respectively, and the error is 0.001. )Z_his value ishigher than other experimental groups performed in thisstudy such as urine routine examination indexes-TCM constitution model and liver function examination indexes- TCM constitution model. Veried by the text group data,this study shows that there is a relatively strong correlationbetween modern physical examination indexes and TCMconstitutional types. )Z_his paper lls the gaps about the researching of cor- relation between TCM constitution and physical examina-tionindexesandprovidesthepossibilityforidenticationofTCM constitution based on the correlation model. )Z_hecombined study of physical examination indexes and TCMconstitutionhasprofoundmeaninginexploringcorrelation betweenTCMandWesternmedicine,whichwouldprovide an associated automation template for both, in promotingTCM modernization and automatic and objective identi-cation of TCM constitution in an innovative approach,which would be expected to avoid the problems existing inthecurrentTCMconstitutionidenticationmethodsandinboosting preventive treatment of disease. )Z_his paper uses clinical data and BP neural network technology which is widely used and matures in the eld ofarticial intelligence, to complete the construction of the Accuracy of test group0102030405060Accuracy (%) 500 1000 1500 2000 2500 3000 3500 4000 0 Times (per 1000 iterations)Figure9:Accuracyofthetestgroupofentirephysicalexamination indexes-constitutional type network model.

For thevolume of sample is not large enough, the future plansinclude improving algorithm and enhancing size of sampledata, such as applying the remaining physical examinationindexes, like the basic data of physical examination, blood lipid index, and the full set of transfusion index, and the corresponding TCMconstitution, which are helpful toget aprediction model with high accuracy and low error, to domore experiments. In addition, the future endeavors willfocus on identication of TCM constitution based on thecorrelation model. For example, the research will develop asystem for identication of TCM constitution based on thecorrelation model. )Z_hen, the system will be applied in theidenticationofclinicalTCMconstitutiontopromoteanewmethod of TCM constitution identication.
