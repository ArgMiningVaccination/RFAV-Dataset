An appointed staff member from each SEER central registry may also submit technical questions to NCI SEER inquiry system using the web- based SINQ system . Relevant questions and answers from Ask A SEER Registrar and from the SINQ system will be incorporated into the next edition of the SEER manual. Note: See the American College of Surgeons Commission on Cancer CAnswer Forum for questions about AJCC TNM staging , the Site-Specific Data Items , and data items not required by SEER . SEER required data items are listed in the NAACCR Required Status Table . Collection and Storage of Date s Dates may be collected and stored in any format, including the traditional format, (month, day, year [MMDDYYYY]), or the recommended date format , (year, month, day [YYYYMMDD]). The recommended format must be used for transmission (see Transmission Instructions for Date Data Item s below). See the 2010 NAACCR Implementation Guidelines and Recommendations for converting dates collected and stored SEER Program Coding and Staging Manual 2021 Preface 4 in the traditional format to the recommended format and vice versa, and for deriving the date flags from information collected in the traditional format. Transmission Instructions for Date s As of January 1, 2010, date s must be transmitted in the year, month, day format (YYYYMMDD). The transmission requirements are intended to improve the interoperability, or communication, of cancer registry data with other electronic record systems. Date data items are fixed -length and left-justified. Replace any missing component with spaces. If there are no known date components, the date data item will be completely blank. For example YYYYMMDD - when complete date is known and valid YYYYMM - when year and month are known and valid, and day is unknown YYYY - when year is known/estimated, and month and day are unknown Blank - when no known date applies Date flags associated with each date data item were added as new data items in 2010. The date flags are used when all eight places of a date data item are blank. The flags explain why the data item is blank. Date flags replace non -date information that had previously been transmitted in date data item s. Coding 99999999 to indicate \"unknown\" is an example of non- date information that was previously transmitted in date data items . Note : Date of Diagnosis cannot be entirely blank. See the specific coding instructions for each date data item. Most SEER registries collect the month, day, and year. When the full date (YYYYMMDD) is transmitted for Date of Diagnosis and/or Date of Last Follow -Up or of Death, the seventh and eighth digits will be held confidentially and only used for survival calculations when received by NCI SEER. The corresponding date flag is not affected (it will r emain blank). SEER Site-Specific Factors 1 - 6 Six data items have been set aside as place holders. Five of t hese data items are not in use and must be left blank. SEER Site -Specific Factor 1 is reserved for capturing information on human papilloma virus (HPV) status. These SEER site- specific factors are not part of the Collaborative Stage Data Collection System.

SEER publishes the 2021 SEER Program Coding and Staging Manual to provide instructions and descriptions that are detailed enough to promote consistent abstracting and coding. SEER Coding a nd Staging Manual Contents The 2021 SEER Program Coding and Staging Manual includes data item descriptions, codes, and coding instructions for cases diagnosed January 1, 2021 and forward as reported by SEER registries. For all cases diagnosed on or after January 1, 2021 , the instructions and codes in this manual take precedence over all previous instructions and codes. The 2021 SEER Program Coding and Staging Manual explains the format and the definitions of the data items required by SEER . Documentation and codes for historic al data items can be found in earlier versions of the SEER Program Code Manual. Earlier versions are available on the SEER website . This coding manual does not prevent SEER contract registries or other registries that follow SEER rules from collecting additional data items useful for those regions. Data items that are not required for 2021 diagnoses but were collected in years prior to 2021 must be transmitted to SEER as bla nks for cases diagnosed in 20 21 and subsequent years. Descriptions of historic data items, allowable codes, and coding rules can be found in historic coding manuals on the SEER website . SEER Program Coding and Staging Manual 2021 Reportability 6 Reportability Dates of Diagnosis/Residency SEER registries are required to collect data on persons who are diagnosed with cancer and who, at the time of diagnosis, are residents of the geographic area covered by the SEER registry. Cases diagnosed on or after January 1, 1973 are reportable to SEER. Registries that joined the SEER Program after 1973 have different reporting start dates specified in their contracts. All cases meeting these criteria are reportable to SEER, including non- analytic cases. Reportable Diagnosis List Definition of Reportable : Meets the criteria for inclusion in a registry. Reportable cases are cases that the registry is required to collect and report. Reporting requirements for SEER registries are established by NCI SEER. A \"Reportable List\" includes all diagnoses to be repor ted by the registry to NCI SEER. 1. Malignant Histologies (In Situ and Invasive) a. Report all histologies with a behavior code of /2 or /3 in the ICD -O- Third Edition, Second Revision Morphology (ICD- O-3.2), except as noted in section 1.b. below i. Early or evolving melanoma, in situ and invasive: As of 01/ 01/2021, early or evolving melanoma in situ, or any other early or evolving melanoma, is reportable. ii. All GIST tumors are reportable as of 01/01/2021 . The behavior code is /3 in ICD - O-3.2. iii. Nearly all thymomas are reportable as of 01/01/2021. The behavior code is /3 in ICD-O-3.2. T he exceptions are Microscopic thymoma of 01/ 01/2015, the ICD -O-3 behavior code changed from /1 to /3. v. The following diagnoses are reportable (not a complete list) Lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS) of breast Intraepithelial neoplasia, grade III Examples : (Not a complete list . See 1.b.iii for PIN III. ) Anal intraepithelial neoplasia of C211) (PeIN III) 600-C609) SEER Program and Staging Manual 2021 Reportability 7 Squamous intraepithelial neoplasia III (SIN III) excluding cervix (C53_) and skin sites coded to C44_ Vaginal intraepithelial neoplasia III (VAIN ile astrocytomas; code the histology and behavior as 9421/3 Except ion: The behavior is non- malignant when the primary site is optic nerve (C723) . vii. Non-invasive mucinous cystic neoplasm (MCN) of with high grade dysplasia is reportable. For neoplasms of the pancreas, the term MCN with high grade dysplasia replaces the term mucinous cystadenocarcinoma, non- invasive. viii. Mature teratoma of the testes in adults is malignant and reportable as 9080/3 ix. Urine cytology positive for malignancy is reportable for diagnoses in 2013 and forward Exception : When a subsequent biopsy of a urinary site is negative, do not report . Code the primary site to C689 in the absence of any other information Do not implement new/additional casefinding m ethods to capture these cases Do not report cytology cases with ambiguous terminology (see page 9 for ambiguous terms) b. Do not report (Exceptions to reporting requirements) i. Skin primary (C440- C449) with any of the following III (SIN (8077) of coded to C44_ Basal cell carcinoma (8090 -8110) Note: If the registry collects basal or squamo us cell carcinoma of skin sites (C440- C449), sequence them in the 60- 87 range and do not report to SEER. ii. In situ c arcinoma of cervix (/2), any histology, cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN III) , or SIN III of the cervix (C530 -C539) Note : Collection stopped effective with cases diagnosed 01/01/1996 and later. As of the 2018 data submission, cervical in situ cancer is no longer required for any diagnosis year. Sequence all cervix in situ cases in t he 60- 87 range regardless of diagnosis year. iii. Prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN III) (C619) Note : Collection stopped effective with cases diagnosed 01/01 /2001 and later. 2. Benign/Non -Malignant Histologies a. Report benign and borderline primary intracranial and central nervous system (CNS) tumors with a behavior code of /0 or /1 in ICD -O-3 (effective with cases diagnosed 01/01/2004 to 12/31/2020) or ICD -O-3.2 (effective with cases diagnosed 01/01/2021 and later). See the table below for the speci fic sites. Note 1 : Benign and borderline tumors of the cranial bones (C410) are not reportable. SEER Program Coding and Staging Manual 2021 Reportability 8 Note 2: Benign and borderline tumors of the peripheral nerves (C47_) are not reportable. b. Report Pilocytic/Juvenile astrocytomas ; code the histology and behavior as 9421/3 when the primary site is C71_ Exception : The behavior is non- malignant when the primary site is optic nerve (C723) . c. Neoplasm and tumor are reportable terms for intracranial and CNS because they are listed in ICD -O-3.2 with behavior code s of /0 and /1 i. \"Mass\" and \"lesion\" are not reportable terms for intracranial and CNS because they are not listed in ICD -O-3.2 with behavior codes of /0 or /1 Table. Required Sites for Benign and Borderline Primary Intracranial and Central Nervous System Tumors General Term Specific Sites ICD-O-3 Topography Code nerves, and other parts of the central nervous system Spinal cord Cauda equina Olfactory nerve Optic nerve Acoustic nerve Cranial nerve, NOS Overlapping lesion of brain and central nervous system Nervous SEER reportability requirements apply to diagnoses made in utero. Diagnoses made in utero are reportable only when the pregnancy results in a live birth . In the absence of documentation of stillbirth, abortion or fetal death, assume there was a live birth and report the case. SEER Program Coding and Staging Manual 2021 Reportability 9 Disease Regression When a reportable diagnosis is confirmed prior to birth and disease is not evident at birth due to regression, accession the case based on the pre- birth diagnosis. Reportable Examples Refer to Appendix E.1 for reportable examples. Non-Reportable Examples Refer to Appendix E .2 for non- reportable examples. Instructions for Reporting Solid Tumors Reportability instructions in this manual apply to solid tumors. For hematopoietic and lymphoid neoplasms, see the Reportability Instructions in the Hematopoietic and Lymphoid Neoplasm Coding Manual and Database . Documentation of Reportable Diagnoses A reportable diagnosis made by a recognized medical practitioner may appear on a variety of medical documentation including, but not l imited to Pathology report Cytology report Imaging report Discharge diagnosis History and physical Other parts of medical record Death certificate Autopsy report Cases diagnosed clinically are reportable. In the absence of a histologic or cytologic confi rmation of a reportable neoplasm , accession a case based on the clinical diagnosis (when a recognized medical practitioner says the patient has a cancer , carcinoma, malignant neoplasm , or reportable neoplasm ). A clinical diagnosis may be recorded in the discharge diagnosis on the face sheet or other parts of the medical record. Note: A pathology report normally takes precedence over a clinical diagnosis. If the patient has a negative biopsy, the case would not be reported. Exceptions 1. Patient receives treatment for cancer. Accession the case. Note : Standard treatments for cancer may be given for non- malignant conditions. Follow back with the physician to clarify if needed. 2. It has been six months or longer since the negative biopsy, and the physician continues to call this a reportable disease. Accession the case. SEER Program Coding and Staging Manual 2021 Reportability 10 Intracranial or CNS Neoplasms An intracranial or diagnostic imaging is reportable. \"Neopl asm\" and \"tumor \" are reportable terms for intracranial and CNS because they are listed in ICD-O-3.2 with behavior codes of /0 and /1 . \"Mass \" and \"lesion \" are not reportable terms for intracranial and CNS because they are not listed in ICD-O-3.2 with behav ior codes of /0 or /1 . Ambiguous Terminology Ambiguous terminology may originate in any source document, such as a pathology report, radiology report, or clinical report. The terms listed below are reportable when they are used with a term such as cancer , carcinoma, sarcoma, etc. Ambiguous terms not listed below are not reportable. Cytology Do not accession a case based ONLY on suspicious cytology. Follow back on cytology diagnoses using ambiguous terminology is strongly recommended. Accession the case when a reportable diagnosis is confirmed later. The date of diagnosis is the date of the later confirmation in this situation. Note : \"Suspicious cytology\" means any cytology report diagnosis that uses an ambiguous term, including ambiguous terms that are listed as reportable in this manual. Cytology refers to the microscopic examination of cells in body fluids obtained from aspiration s, washings, scrapings, and smears; usually a function of the pathology department. Important: Accession cases with cytology diagnoses that are positive for malignant cells . Urine cytology positive for malignancy is reportable . Code the primary site to C689 in the absence of any other information . Ambiguous Terms for Reportab ility Apparent(ly) Appears Comparable with Compatible with Consistent with Favor(s) Malignant appearing Most likely Presumed Probable Suspect(ed) Suspicious (for) Typical (of) Report cases that use the words on the list or an equivalent word such as \"favored\" rather than \"favor(s) .\" Do not substitute synonyms such as \"supposed\" for presumed or \"equal\" for comparable. Do not substitute \"likely\" for \"most likely.\" SEER Program Coding and Staging Manual 2021 Reportability 11 There m ay be ambiguous terms preceded by a modifier, such as \"mildly\" suspicious. In general, ignore modifiers or other adjectives and accept the reportable ambiguous term. Ambiguous Terminology Lists: References of Last Resort This section clarifies the use of Ambiguous Terminology as listed in STORE 2018 for case reportability and staging in Commission on Cancer (CoC) -accredited programs. When abstracting, registrars are to use the \"Ambiguous Terms at Diagnosis\" list with respect to case reportability, and the \"Ambiguous Terms Describing Tumor Spread\" list with respect to tumor spread for staging purposes. However, these lists need to be used correctly . The first and foremost resource for the registrar for questionable cases is the physician who dia gnosed and/or staged the tumor. The ideal way to approach abstracting situations when the medical record is not clear is to follow up with the physician . If the physician is not available, the medical record, and any other pertinent reports (e.g., pathology, etc.) should be read closely for the required information. The purpose of the Ambiguous Terminology lists is so that in the case where wording in the patient record is ambiguous with respect to reportability or tumor spread and no further information is available from any resource , registrars will make consistent decisions. When there is a clear statement of malignancy or tumor spread (i.e., the registrar can determine malignancy or tumor spread from the resources available), they should not refer to the Ambiguous Terminology lists. Registrars should only rely on these lists when the situation is not clear and the case cannot be discussed with the appropriate physician/pathologist. The CoC recognizes that not every registrar has access to the physician w ho diagnosed and/or staged the tumor, and as a result, the Ambiguous Terminology lists continue to be used in CoC -accredited programs and maintained by CoC as \"references of last resort .\" How to Use Ambiguous Terminology for Case Ascertainment 1. In Situ an d Invasive (Behavior codes /2 and /3) a. If any of the reportable ambiguous terms precede a word that is synonymous with a reportable in situ or invasive tumor (e.g., cancer, carcinoma, malignant neoplasm, etc.), accession the case. Example: The pathology report says: Prostate biopsy with markedly abnormal cells that are typical of adenocarcinoma. Accession the case. Negative Example: The final diagnosis on the outpatient report reads: Rule out pancreatic cancer. Do not accession the case. b. Discrep ancies i. Accession the case based on the reportable ambiguous term when there are reportable and non- reportable ambiguous terms in the medical record 1. Do not accession a case when the original source document used a non - reportable ambiguous term and subsequent documents refer to history of cancer Example : Report from the dermatologist is \"possible melanoma.\" Patient admitted later for unrelated procedure and physician listed history of melanoma. No further information available, no evidence of treatment for melanoma. Give priority to the information from the dermatologist and do not report this case. \"Possible\" is not a reportable ambiguous term. The later information is less reliable in this case. SEER Program Coding and Staging Manual 2021 Reportability 12 ii. Accept the reportable term and accession the case when there is a single report in which both reportable and non- reportable terms are used Example: Abdominal CT reveals a 1 cm liver lesion. \"The lesion is consistent with hepatocellular carcinoma\" appears in the discussion section of the report. The final diagnosis is \"1 cm liver lesion, possibly hepatocellular carcinoma.\" Accession the case. with\" is Accept \"consistent with\" over the non- reportable term \"possibly.\" c. Do not accession a case based ONLY on suspicious cytology Note: \"Suspicious cytology\" means any cytology report diagnosis that uses an ambiguous term, including ambiguous terms that are listed as reportable on the pre ceding page. Follow back on cytology diagnoses using ambiguous terminology is strongly recommended. Cytology refers to the microscopic examination of cells in body fluids obtained from aspirations, washings, scrapings, and smears; usually a function of the pathology department . Important: Accession cases with cytology diagnoses that are positive for malignant cells. d. Use the reportable ambiguous terms when screening diagnoses on pathology reports, operative reports, scans, mammogram s, and other diagnostic testing with the exception of tumor markers i. Do not accession a case when resection, excision, biopsy, cytology, or physician's statement proves the ambiguous diagnosis is not reportable Example 1: Mammogram shows calcifications susp icious for intraductal carcinoma. The biopsy of the area surrounding the calcifications is negative for malignancy. Do not accession the case. Example 2: CT report states \"mass in the right kidney, highly suspicious for renal cell carcinoma.\" CT-guided nee dle biopsy with final diagnosis \"Neoplasm suggestive of oncocytoma. A malignant neoplasm cannot be excluded.\" Discharged back to the nursing home and no other information is available. Do not accession the case. The suspicious CT finding was biopsied and not proven to be malignant. \"Suggestive of\" is not a reportable ambiguous term. Example 3: Stereotactic biopsy of the left breast is \"focally suspicious for DCIS\" and is followed by a negative needle localization excisional biopsy. Do not accession the case. The needle localization excisional biopsy was performed to further evaluate the suspicious stereotactic biopsy finding. The suspicious diagnosis was proven to be false. Example 4: Esophageal biopsy with diagnosis of \"focal areas suspicious for adenocarci noma in situ.\" Diagnosis on partial esophagectomy specimen \"with foci of high grade dysplasia; no invasive carcinoma identified.\" Do not accession the case. The esophagectomy proved that the suspicious biopsy result was false. 2. Benign and borderline primary intracranial and CNS tumors a. Use the \"Ambiguous terms that are reportable\" list above to identify benign and borderline primary intracranial and CNS tumors that are reportable b. \"Neoplasm \" and \"tumor \" are reportable terms for intracranial and CNS because they are listed in ICD -O-3.2 with behavior codes of /0 and /1 c. Accession the case when any of the reportable ambiguous terms precede either the word \" tumor \" or the word \" neoplasm \" SEER Program Coding and Staging Manual 2021 Reportability 13 Example: The mass on the CT scan is consistent with pituitary tumor. Accession the case. d. \"Mass \" and \"lesion \" are not reportable terms for intracranial and CNS because they are not listed in ICD -O-3.2 with behavior codes of /0 or /1 e. Discrepancies i. Accession the case based on the reportable ambiguous term when there are report able and non- reportable ambiguous terms in the medical record 1. Do not accession a case when subsequent documents refer to history of tumor and the original source document used a non -reportable ambiguous term ii. Accept the reportable term and accession the cas e when there is a single report and one section of a report uses a reportable term such as \"apparently\" and another section of the same report uses a term that is not on the reportable list Exception: Do not accession a case based ONLY on ambiguous cytology (the reportable term is preceded by an ambiguous term such as apparently, appears, compatible with, etc.). f. Use the reportable ambiguous terms when screening diagnoses on pathology reports, scans, ult rasounds, and other diagnostic testing other than tumor markers i. Do not accession the case when resection, excision, biopsy, cytology or physician's statement proves the ambiguous diagnosis is not reportable Instructions for Hematopoietic and Lymphoid Neoplasms See the Reportability Instructions in the and Lymphoid Neoplasm Coding Manual and Database . Casefinding Lists Current and previous casefinding lists are available on the SEER website. Use the casefinding lists to screen prospective cases and identify cancer cases for inclusion in the registry. It is important to include all casefinding sources when searching f or reportable cases. Sources include Inpatient/Outpatient Admission/Discharge Documents Pathology/Cytology Pathology Reports Surgery Logs/Schedules Radiology Nuclear Medicine Radiation Therapy Logs Chemotherapy Outpatient Logs Emergency Room Records Autopsy Reports Pain Clinic Logs SEER Program Coding and Staging Manual 2021 Reportability 14 A casefinding list is not the same as a reportable list . Casefinding lists are intended for searching a variety of cases so as not to miss any reportable cases. Definition of Casefind ing (case ascertainment): Process of identifying all reportable cases through review of source documents and case listings. Casefinding covers a range of cases that need to be assessed to determine whether or not they are reportable. SEER Program Coding and Staging Manual 2021 Changing Information on the Abstract 15 Changing Information on the Abstract The information originally collected on the abstract should be changed or modified under the following circumstances 1. To correct coding or abstracting errors (for example, errors found during quality control activities) 2. When clarifications or rule changes retroactively affect data item code Example: SEER adds codes to a data item and asks the registries to review a set of cases and update using the new codes. 3. When better information is a vailable later Example 1: Consults from specialty labs, pathology report addenda or comments or other information have been added to the chart. Reports done during the diagnostic workup and placed on the chart after the registrar abstracted the information may contain valuable information. Whenever these later reports give better information about the histology, grade of tumor, primary site, etc., change the codes to reflect the better information. Example 2: The primary site was recorded as unknown at the time of diagnosis. At a later date, the physician determines that the cancer is primary to the testis. Change the primary site from unknown to testis. Example 3: The original diagnosis was in situ. Metastases are diagnosed at a later date. Change the behav ior code for the original diagnosis from in situ to invasive when no new primary has been diagnosed in the interim. Example 4: Patient seen in Hospital A. The pathologic diagnosis was negative for malignancy. Patient goes to Hospital B and the slides from Hospital A are re- read. The diagnosis at Hospital B is reportable. Hospital B sends their slide report back to Hospital A. Hospital A reports the case based on the info from Hospital B. Enter supporting documentation in a text field. 4. When the date of diagnosis is confirmed in retrospect to be earlier than the original date abstracted Example: Patient has surgery for a benign argentaffin carcinoid (8240/1) of the sigmoid colon in May 2020. In January 20 21, the patient is admitted with widespread metasta sis consistent with malignant argentaffin carcinoid. The registrar accessions the malignant argentaffin carcinoid as a 20 21 diagnosis. Two months later, the pathologist reviews the slides from the May 2020 surgery and concludes that the carcinoid diagnosed in 20 20 was malignant. Change the date of diagnosis to May 2020 and histology to 8241 and the behavior code to malignant (/3). SEER Program Coding and Staging Manual 2021 Determining Multiple Primaries 16 Determining Multiple Primaries Solid Tumors Apply the gene ral instructions and site -specific instructions for determining multiple primaries in the current Solid Tumor Rules. Apply the site -specific multiple primary rules in the current Solid Tumor Rules. Site-specific multiple primary rules cover the following Primary Site Topography Codes Head and , Lung, , Peripheral Nerves, CNS The General rules do not apply to hematopoietic primaries (lymphoma and leukemia) of any site or to the reportable benign or borderline intracranial or CNS tumors. The head and neck, colon, rectosigmoid and rectum, breast, kidney, urinary sites, and malignant CNS and peripheral nerves rules exclude lymphoma and leukemia (M9590- M9993) and Kaposi sarcom a (M9140). M9993) Hematopoietic and Lymphoid Neoplasm Coding Manual and Database have been made for 2021 cases. The update s reflect changes based on ICD -O-3.2. Apply the Multiple Primary Rules in the Hematopoietic and Lymphoid Neoplasm Coding Manual and Database . Transplants Transplanted organs or tissue may origina te from a. Organs or tissue from the patient's own body (called autograft) or b. Another human donor (homograft or allograft) Accession a new primary in the transplanted organ as you would a ny new primary , applying the current Solid Tumor R ules. Code the primary site to the location of the transplanted organ, i.e., code the malignancy where it resides/lies . Example : Diagnosis of malignancy in transplanted section of colon serving as esophagus. Code the primary site as esophagus. Document the situation in a text field. SEER Program Coding and Staging Manual 2021 Section I: Basic Record Identification 17 Section I Basic Record Identification The Basic Record Identification data item s provide a unique identifier for individual records or a set of records for each person and tumor in the SEER data system.

Code Description 1 Hospital inpatient; Managed health plans with comprehensive, unified medical records (new code definition effective with diagnosis on or after 01/01 /2006) 2 Radiation Treatment Centers or Medical Oncology Centers (ho spital affiliated or independent) (effective with diagnosis on or after 01/01 /2006) 3 Laboratory Only (hospital affiliated or independent) 4 Physician's Office/Private Medical Practitioner (LMD) 5 Nursing/Convalescent Home/Hospice 6 Autopsy Only 7 Death Certificate Only 8 Other hospital outpatient units/surgery centers (effective with diagnosis on or after 01/01 /2006) Definitions Comprehensive, unified medical record A hospital or managed health care system that maintains a single record for each patient. That record includes all encounters in affiliated locations. Stand- alone medical record An independent facility; a facility that is not a part of a hospital or managed care system An independent medical record containing only information from encounters with that specific facility or practice Managed health plan Any practice and/or facility where all of the diagnostic and treatment information is maintained in one unit record The abstractor is able to use the unit record when abstracting th e case Examples of such facilities: HMOs or other health plan such as Kaiser, Veterans Administration, or military facilities Physician office A physician office performs examinations and tests. Physician offices may perform limited surgical procedures Note: The category \"physician's office\" also includes facilities that are called surgery centers when surgical procedures under general anesthesia cannot be performed in these facilities . SEER Program Coding and Staging Manual 2021 Section II: Information Source 24 Surgery center Surgery centers are equipped and staffed to perform surgical procedures under general anesthesia The patient usually does not stay overnight Note: If the facility cannot perform surgical procedures under general anesthesia, code as physician's office.

There were no source documents from codes 1, 2, 8, 4, 3, or 5. 7 7 Death Certificate Only Death certificate Death certificate is the only source of information; follow - back activities did not identify source documents from codes 1, 2, 8, 4, 3, 5 or 6. If another source document is subsequently identified, the Type of Reporting Source code must be changed to the appropriate code in the range of 1, 2, 8, 4, 3, 5 , or 6. 8 8 Other hospital outpatient units/surgery centers Other hospital outpatient units/surgery centers Includes, but not limited to, outpatient surgery and nuclear medicine services. There were no source documents from codes 1 or 2. 3 SEER Program Coding and Staging Manual 2021 Section II: Information Source 25 Priority Order for Assigning Type of Reporting Source Code the source that provided the best information used to abstract the case. Example: The only patient record available for a physician office biopsy is the pathology report identified from a freestanding laboratory. Assign code 3 [Laboratory Only (hospital -affiliated or independent)]. Reporting source should reflect the lab where this cas e was identified. The MD office added nothing to the case, not even a confirmation of malignancy. When multiple source documents are used to abstract a case, use the following priority order to assign a code for Type of Reporting Source: Codes: 1, 2, 8, 4, 3, 5, 6, 7. Note: Beginning with cases diagnosed 01/01/2006, the definitions for this data item have been expanded. Codes 2 and 8 were added to identify outpatient sources that were previously grouped under code 1. Laboratory reports now have priority over nursing home reports. The source facilities included in the previous code 1 (hospital inpatient and outpatient) are split between codes 1, 2, and 8. SEER recommends that you do not make changes to this data item for historic cases in the central cancer registry database; i.e., cases diagnosed prior to January 1, 2006. Conversion of the old codes would be problematic and would require extensive and time -consuming review of original source documents.

See https://www.ssa.gov for more information SEER Program Coding and Staging Manual 2021 Section III: Demographic Information 33 Place of Residence Place of Residence at Diagnosis SEER registries collect information on place of residence at diagnosis. Information relating to address is not transmitted to SEER. The SEER rules for determining residency at diagnosis are either identical or comparable to rules used by the U.S. Census Bureau, to ensure comparability of definitions of cases (numerator) and the population at risk (denominator). Coding Priorities/Sources 1. Code the street address of usual residence as stated by the patient. Definition: U.S. Census Bureau Instructions: \"The place where he or she lives and sleeps most of the time or the place the person says is his or her usual home.\" The residency rules of departments of vital statistics may differ from those of the U.S. Census Bureau/SEER. 2. A post office box is not a reliable sourc e to identify the residency at diagnosis. Post office box addresses do not provide accurate geographical information for analyzing cancer incidence. Use the post office box address only if no street address information is available after follow -back. 3. Use r esidency information from a death certificate only when the residency from other sources is coded as unknown. Review each case carefully and apply the U.S. Census Bureau/SEER rules for determining residence. a. For example, t he death certificate may give the person's previous home address rather than the nursing home address as the place of residence . If the person was a resident of a nursing home at diagnosis , use the nursing home address as the place of residence. 4. Do not use legal status or citizenship to code residence Persons with More than One Residence 1. Code the residence where the patient spends the majority of time (usual residence) 2. If the usual residence is not known or the information is not available, code the residence the patient specifies at the time of diagnosis Examples : The above rules should be followed for \"snowbirds\" who live in the south for the winter months, \"sunbirds\" who live in the north during the summer months, and people with vacation residences that they occupy for a portion of the year. Persons with No Usual Residence Homeless people and transients are examples of persons with no usual residence. Code the patient's residence at the time of diagnosis such as the shelter or the hospital where diagnosis was confirmed. SEER Program Coding and Staging Manual 2021 Section III: Demographic Information 34 Temporary Residents of SEER Area Code the place of usual residence rather than the temporary address for Migrant workers Educators temporarily assigned to a university in the SEER area Persons temporarily residing with family during cancer treatment Milit ary personnel on temporary duty assignments (TDY) Boarding school students below college level (code the parent's residence) Code the residence where the student is living while attending college. Code the address of the institution for Persons in Instit utions . Note : Code the physical address of the institution. Do not code the post office box. U.S. Census Bureau definition: \"Persons under formally authorized, supervised care or custody\" are residents of the institution.\" Persons who are incarcerated Persons who are physically handicapped, mentally challenged, or mentally ill who are residents of homes, schools, hospitals or wards Residents of nursing, convalescent, and rest homes Long- term residents of other hospitals such as Veterans Adm inistration (VA) hospitals Persons in the Armed Forces and on Maritime Ships (including Merchant Marine) Armed Forces For military personnel and their family members, code the address of the military installation or surrounding community as stated by the patient. Personnel Assigned to Navy, Coast Guard, and Maritime Ships The U.S. Census Bureau has detailed rules for determining residency for personnel assigned to these ships. The rules refer to the ship's deployment, port of departure, destination, and its homeport. Refer to U.S. Census Bureau Publications for detailed rules.

This data item is collected by SEER registries for identification and matching purposes; it is not submitted to NCI SEER. Coding Instructions 1. Record the number and street address or the rural mailing address of the patient's usual residence when the tumor was diagnosed 2. Record the physical number and street address of the patient at diagnosis. If the patient also has a Post Of fice (PO) Box address, record the PO Box address in Address at Diagnosis -- Supplemental. 3. Spell out the address fully with standardized use of abbreviations and punctuation per U.S. Postal Service (USPS) postal addressing standards. The USPS Postal Addressing Standards, Publication 28, May 2015, can be found on the Internet at http://pe.usps.gov/cpim/ftp/pubs/pub28/pub28.pdf 4. The use of capital letters is preferred by the USPS; use recognized USPS standardized abbreviations. Do not use punctuation unless absolutely necessary to c larify an address; leave space between numbers and words. Example: 103 FIRST AVE SW APT 102 5. Limit abbreviations to thos e recognized by the Postal Service standard abb reviations. They include, but are not limited to: AVE ( avenue), BLVD (boulevard), CIR (ci rcle), CT (court), DR (drive) PLZ (plaza), PARK (park), PKWY (parkway), RD (road), SQ (square), ST (street), APT (apartment), BLDG ( building), FL (floor), STE (suite), UNIT (unit), RM (room), DEPT (department), N (north), NE (northeast), NW (nor thwest), S (south), SE (southeast), SW (southwest), E (east, W (west). A complete lis t of recognized street abbreviations is provided in Appendix C of USPS Publication 28. 6. Punctuation is normally limited to periods (for example, 39.2 RD) , slashes for fractional addresses (101 1/2 MAIN ST), and hyphens when a hyphen carries meaning (289- 01 MONTGOMERY AVE). Use of the pound sign (#) to designate address units should be avoided whenever possible. The referred notation is a follows: 102 MAIN ST APT 101. If a pound sig n is used, there must be a space between the pound sign and the secondary number (425 FLOWER BLVD # 72). 7.

It is computer generated using patient address information. Census Tract 2010 records the census tract of a patient's residence at the time of diagnosis. The codes are the same codes used by the U.S. Census Bureau for the Year 2010 census. This item is coded for cases diagnosed January 1, 2006 and forward. This data item allows a central registry to add year 2010 Census tracts to cases diagnosed in previous years without losing the codes in the data item s Census Tract 1970/80/90 and Census Tract 2000 which are only collected historically. A census tract is a small statistical subdivision of a county that, in general, has between 2,500 and 8,000 residents. Local committees and the U.S. Census Bureau establish census tract boundaries and try to keep the same boundaries from census to census to maintain historical comparability, though this is not always possible. When populations increase or decreas e, old tracts may be subdivided, disappear, or have their boundaries changed. Because the census tracts do change, it is important to know which census tract definition is used to code them. Codes Census tract codes 000100- 999998 Special Codes Code Description 000000 Area not census -tracted 999999 Area census -tracted, but census tract is not available Blank Census Tract 2010 not coded Coding Instructions 1. Code the Census tract of the patient's residence at the time of diagnosis 2. Census tract codes should be assigned based on a computer match (geocoding software) 3. Census tracts are identified by four -digit numbers ranging from 0001 to 9989 and a two- digit suffix 4. Assign code 999999 when an area does have an assigned census tract but the census tr act is not available 5. Right justify the first four digits and zero fill to the left. Add the suffix as the fifth and sixth digits if it exists; otherwise, use 00 so all six positions are coded. Example 1: Code census tract 516 and suffix 21 to 051621. Exam ple 2: Census tract 409 and suffix does not exist should be coded 040900.

'Origin' i s defined by the U.S. Census Bureau as the heritage, nationality group, lineage, or in some cases, the country of birth of the person or the person's parents or ancestors before their arrival in the United States. The five race data item s (Race 1 - Race 5 ) make it possible to code multiple races for one person, consistent with the 2000 Census. All resources in the facility, including the medical record, face sheet, physician and nursing notes, photographs, and any other sources, must be used to determine race. If a facility does not print race in the medical record but does maintain it in electronic form, the electronic data must also be reviewed.

Codes 02-32, 96- 98 take priority over code 01 3. Code only the specific race when both a specific race code and a non -specific race code apply a. Codes 04- 17 take priority over code 96 b. Codes 16- 17 take priority over code 15 c. Codes 20- 32 take priority over code 97 d. Codes 02- 32 and 96- 97 take priority over code 98 e. Code 98 takes priority over code 99 Coding Instructions 1. Do not use patient name as the basis for coding race a. See Coding Instruction 15, Exception, for the only situation in which name is taken into account when coding race 2. Code race using the highest priority source available according to the list below (a is the highest and c is the lowest) when race is reported differently by two or more sources . Use self -reported information as first priority. a. Self-reported race information t akes precedence over genetic testing and over information obtained through linkages . Generally, race information is used fro m linkages when race data are missing or unknown, or to enhance data. Self-reported information is the highest priority for coding race because the race information for the U.S. population comes from census data and that information is self -reported. For n ational cancer statistics, in order for the numerator (cancer cases) and the denominator (population) to be comparable, use self-reported race information whenever it is available. Sources in Priority Order a. The patient's self -declared identification b. Documentation in the medical record c. Death certificate 3. Assign the same race code(s) for all tumors for one patient 4. Code the race(s) of the patient in data item s Race 1, Race 2, Race 3, Race 4, and Race 5 a. Code 88 for the remaining race data it ems (Race 2 - Race 5) when at least one race, but fewer than five races, are reported 5. Use the associated text field to document a. Why a particular race code was chosen when there are discrepancies in race information Example : The patient is identified as Black in nursing notes and White in a dictated physical exam. Use a text field to document why one race was coded rather than the other. SEER Program Coding and Staging Manual 2021 Section III: Demographic Information 67 b. That no race information is available 6. Code as 01 (White) when a. The race is described as White or Caucasian regardless of place of birth b. There is a statement that the patient is Hispanic or Latino(a) and no further information is available i. A person of Spanish origin may be any race; however, for coding race when there is no further information other than \"Hispa nic\" or \"Latino(a),\" assign race as White as a last resort instead of coding unknown. Example: Sabrina Fitzsimmons is a Latina. No further information is available. Code race as 01 (White). Note 1 : Do not code 98 (Other) in this situation. Note 2 : Persons of Spanish or Hispanic origin may be of any race, although persons of Mexican, Central American, South American, Puerto Rican, or Cuban origin are usually White. 7. Code race as 02 (Black) when the st ated race is African -American, Black, or Negro 8. Assign code 03 for any person stated to be a. Native American (western hemisphere) OR b. Indian, whether from North, Central, South, or Latin America 9. Assign a specific code when a specific Asian race is stated. Do n ot use code 96 when a specific race is known. Example: Patient is described as Asian in a consult note and as second generation Korean- American in the history. Code Race 1 as 08 (Korean) and Race 2 through Race 5 as 88. Note: Do not code 96 (Other Asian including Asian, NOS and Oriental, NOS) in a subsequent race data item when a specific Asian race has been coded. 10. Code the race based on birthplace information when the race is recorded as Oriental, Mongolian, or Asian and the place of birth is recorded as C hina, Japan, the Philippines, or another Asian nation Example 1: Race is recorded as Asian and the place of birth is recorded as Japan. Code race as 05 (Japanese) because it is more specific than 96. Example 2: The person describes himself as an Asian -Amer ican born in Laos. Code race as 11 (Laotian) because it is more specific than 96. 11. Use the appropriate non- specific code 96 (Other Asian including Asian, NOS and Oriental, NOS), 97 (Pacific Islander, NOS) , or 98 (Other) when there is no race code for a spec ific race Note : Document the specified race in a text field. 12. Do not use code 96, 97, or 98 for \"multi -racial.\" See Coding Examples below . 13. All race data item s must be coded 99 (Unknown) when Race 1 is coded 99 (Unknown) Note : Assign code 99 in Race 2- 5 only when Race 1 is coded 99. 14. Assign code 99 for death certificate only (DCO) cases when race is unknown SEER Program Coding and Staging Manual 2021 Section III: Demographic Information 68 15. Refer to Appendix D \"Race and Nationality Des criptions from the 2000 Census and Bureau of Vital Statistics \" when race is unknown or not stated in the medical record and birth place is recorded a. In some cases, race may be inferred from the nationality. Use Appendix D to identify nationalities from which race codes may be inferred. Example 1: Record states: \"this native of Portugal...\" Code race as 01 (White) per the Appendix. Example 2: Record states: \"this patient was Nigerian...\" Code race as 02 (Black) per the Appendix. Excepti on: Code Race 1 through Race 5 as 99 (Unknown) when patient's name is incongruous with the race inferred on the basis of nationality. Do not code the inferred race when the patient's name is incongruent with the race inferred on the basis of nationality. Example 1: Patient's name is Siddhartha Rao and birthplace is listed as England. Code Race 1 through Race 5 as 99 (Unknown). Example 2: Patient's name is Ping Chen and birthplace is Ethiopia. Code Race 1 through Race 5 as 99 (Unknown). 16. When the patient face- sheet indicates \"Race Other,\" look for other descriptions of the patient's race. When no further race information is available , code race as 99 (Unknown) and document that patient face- sheet indicates \"Race Other,\" and no further race information is avail able. 17. Patient photographs may be used with caution to determine race in the absence of any other information a. Use caution when interpreting a patient photograph to assist in determining race. Review the patient record for a statement to verify race. The use of photographs alone to determine race may lead to misclassification of race. 18. Code the race data item s in the order stated when no other priority applies 19. The race of parents, when known, may be used with caution to determine patient's race in the absence of other more specific information (see coding examples 5 and 7) Coding Examples Example 1: Patient is stated to be Japanese. Code as 05 (Japanese). Example 2: Patient is stated to be German -Irish. Code as 01 (White). Example 3: Patient is described as Arabian. Code as 01 (White). Example 4: Patient described as a black female. Code as 02 (Black). Example 5: Patient states she has a Polynesian mother and Tahitian father. Code Race 1 as 25 (Polynesian), Race 2 as 26 (Tahitian) and Race 3 th rough Race 5 as 88. Example 6: Patient describes herself as multi -racial (nothing more specific) and nursing notes say \"African- American.\" Code Race 1 as 02 (Black) and Race 2 through Race 5 as 8 8. Example 7: The patient is described as Asian -American wi th Korean parents. Code race as 08 (Korean) because it is more specific than 96 (Asian) [ -American]. SEER Program Coding and Staging Manual 2021 Section III: Demographic Information 69 Example 8: Race 1 through Race 5 in the cancer record are coded as 99 (Unknown). The death certificate states race as black. Change cancer record for Race 1 to 02 (Black) and Race 2 through Race 5 to 88. Example 9: Race 1 is coded in the cancer record as 96 (Asian). Death certificate gives birthplace as China. Change Race 1 in the cancer record to 04 (Chinese) and code Race 2 through Race 5 as 88. Example 10: Patient is stated to be Chinese and b lack. Code Race 1 as 04 (Chinese), code Race 2 as 02 (Black). Code in the order stated when no other priority applies. Example 11: Patient described as Middle Eastern. Code as 01 (White). Example 12: Patient described as Greek. Code as 01 (White). History 1. Race 1 is the data item used to compare with race data on cases diagnosed prior to January 1, 2000 2. Race codes must be identical on each record when the patient has multiple tumors a. For cases with all diagnoses prior to January 1, 2000, Race 2 through Race 5 must be blank b. For cases that have multiple tumors with at least one primary diagnosed on or after January 1, 2000 , race codes in Race 1, Race 2, Race 3, Race 4, and Race 5 must be identical on all r ecords 3. Codes 08-13 became effective with diagnoses on or after January 1, 1988 4. Code 09 was retired effective with diagnoses on or after January 1, 2010 5. Code 14 became effective with diagnoses on or after January 1, 1994 6. Codes 15, 16, and 17 became effectiv e with diagnoses on or after January 1, 2010 7.

San Francisco, San Jose- Monterey, and Los Angeles are permitted to use codes 14 and 20- 97 for cases diagnosed after January 1, 1987; Greate r California is permitted to use codes 14 and 20-97 for cases diagnosed after January 1, 1988. Other SEER registries may choose to recode cases diagnosed prior to 1991 using 14 and 20- 97 if all cases in the following race codes are reviewed: 96 (Other Asia n, including Asian, NOS and Oriental, NOS); 97 (Pacific Islander, NOS); 98 (Other); and 99 (Unknown). SEER Program Coding and Staging Manual 2021 Section III: Demographic Information 70 IHS Link ihsLink The Indian Health Service (IHS) Link reports the result of linkage between the registry database and the Indian Health Service patient registration database. This linkage identifies American Indians who were misclassified as non -Indian in the registry. The computer linkage program will automatically assign the code for this data item. SEER requires the IHS Link for cases diagnosed January 1, 1988 and forward. IHS link may be submitted for cases diagnosed in earlier years. The data item will be blank unless an attempt was made to link the case with the records from the Indian Health Service.

Hispanic origin stated on the death certificate c. Birthplace d. Information about life history and/or language spoken found in the abstracting process e. A last name or maiden name (birth surname) found on a list of Hispanic/Spanish names 3. Assign code 6 when there is more than one ethnicity/origin (multiple codes) , such as Mexican (code 1) and Dominican Republic (code 8). There is no hierarchy among the codes 1- 5 or 8. 4. Assign code 7 when the only evidence of the patient's Hispanic origin is a surname or maiden name (birth surname) and there is no evidence that the patient is not Hispanic. Code 7 is ordinarily for central registry use only. 5. Portuguese, Brazilians , and Fil ipinos are not presumed to be Spanish or non- Spanish a. Assign code 7 when the patient is Portuguese, Brazilian, or Filipino and their name appears on a Hispanic surname list SEER Program Coding and Staging Manual 2021 Section III: Demographic Information 72 b.

Example 3: Married female, no maiden name (birth surname) , Race 99, born in Peru, married last name is on Spanish surname list, no statement regarding ethnicity available. Code as 4 (South or Central America) using coding instruction 2.c. Example 4: Patient has two last names, o ne of the last names is on the Spanish surname list. Code as 7 (Spanish surname only) using coding instruction 4. SEER Program Coding and Staging Manual 2021 Section III: Demographic Information 73 NHIA Derived Hispanic Origin Length: NAACCR Item Identification Algorithm (NHIA) is a computerized algorithm that uses a combination of variables to directly or indirectly classify cases as Hispanic for analyt ic purposes. Note : Surname lists are just one component of the indirect assignment of ethnicity or race by NHIA. A number of filters based on race, ethnicity, birthplace, or county attribute may preclude a patient from ever being indirectly assigned based on surname. Also, if a patient is coded as non- Hispanic, the registry may elect NOT to run the case through NHIA. A female patient's last name could, however, be used to classify the case as Hispanic for the NHIA variable after making it through the filters and exclusions. Persons are also included as Hispanic/Latino(a) when they are female cases with heavily Hispanic maiden names; female cases with missing maiden names and heavily Hispanic last names; female cases with generally Hispanic, moderately Hisp anic, occasionally Hispanic, or indeterminate maiden names and heavily Hispanic last names. Code Description 0 Non-Hispanic 1 Mexican, by birthplace or other specific identifier 2 Puerto Rican, by birthplace or other specific identifier 3 Cuban, by birthplace or other specific identifier 4 South or Central American (except Brazil), by birthplace or other specific identifier 5 Other specified Spanish/Hispanic origin (includes European; excludes Dominican Republic), by birthplace or other specific identifier 6 Spanish, NOS; Hispanic, NOS; Latino, NOS 7 NHIA surname match only 8 Dominican Republic Blank Algorithm has not been run SEER Program Coding and Staging Manual 2021 Section III: Demographic Information 74 Sex Item Length: 1 Item #: 220 NAACCR Name: Sex XML NAACCR ID: sex Code the sex (gender) of the patient.

This is because consults are usually requested from a more experienced or specialized pathologist/lab and are generally thought to be more accurate. SEER Program Coding and Staging Manual 2021 Section IV : Description of this Neoplasm 79 Date of Diagnosis Item Length: 8 NAACCR Item #: 390 NAACCR Name: Date of Diagnosis XML NAACCR ID: dateOfDiagnosis The date of diagnosis is the month, day, and year the reportable neoplasm was first identified , clinically or microscopically, by a recognized medical practitioner. Date of diagnosis must be transmitted in the YYYYMMDD form at. Date of diagnosis may be recorded in the transmission format, or recorded in the traditional format (MMDDYYYY) and converted electronically to the transmission format. Regardless of the format, at least Year of diagnosis must be known or estimated for cases transmitted to SEER . Year of diagnosis cannot be blank or unknown for cases transmitted to SEER. Transmitting Dates Transmit date data items in the year, month, day format (YYYYMMDD). Transmit only known or estimated year of diagnosis, blanks will not be accepted. Leave the month, day and/or year 0F0F0F* blank when they cannot be estimated or are unknown. Common Formats YYYYMMDD Complete date is known YYYYMM Year and month are known/estimated; day is unknown YYYY Year is known/estimated; month and day cannot be estimated or are unknown Blank Year*, month, and day cannot be estimated or are unknown Transmit Instructions 1. Transmit date data items in the year, month, day format (YYYYMMDD) 2. Transmit only known or estimated yea r of diagnosis, blanks will not be accepted 3. Leave the month and/or day blank when they cannot be estimated or are unknown 4. Most SEER registries collect the month, day, and year of diagnosis. When the full date (YYYYMMDD) is transmitted, the seventh and eighth digits (day) will be held confidentially and only used for survival calculations when received by NCI SEER. The corresponding date flag is not affected (it will remain blank). * Cases NOT transmitted to SEER only. SEER Program Coding and Staging Manual 2021 Section IV : Description of this Neoplasm 80 Instructions Cases with an unknown year of diagnosis cannot be transmitted to NCI SEER. It is very important to do everything possible to determine the year of diagnosis. Case transmitted to NCI SEER 1. Follow -back must be done to obtain the date of diagnosis. If no information can be found, follow instruction 2. 2. Date of diagnosis must be estimated. See the coding instructions below for estimating date of diagnosis. a. For reports dated December or January of a given year, code the month of the report or the month of admission (instruction 9 .a.viii.). Coding the month of the report or the month of admission results in a better estimate of the date of diagnosis than coding month as 99 and having the computer assign July as the month of diagnosis, for example. b. When the diagnosis date is stated to be spring, summer, fall, or winter, follow coding instructions 9.a.i., ii., iii., and iv. Case NOT transmitted to NCI SEER 1. Code the date of diagnosis when known, even if the case is not transmitted to SEER for other reasons 2. Code as unknown when there is no information available Codes for Yea r Code the four -digit year of diagnosis Codes for Month Code Description 01 January 02 February 03 March 04 April 05 May 06 June 07 July 08 August 09 September 10 October 11 November 12 December SEER Program Coding and Staging Manual 2021 Section IV : Description of this Neoplasm 81 Codes for Day 01 02 03 .. .. 31 Coding Instructions 1. Code the month, day and year the tumor was first diagnosed, clinically or microscopically, by a recognized medical practitioner a. When the first diagnosis includes reportable ambiguous terminology, record the date of that diagnosis Exception : Do not use the date of diagnosis from a cytology report using ambiguous terminology . See Coding Instruction #5 below. Example: Area of microcalcifications in breast suspicious for malignancy on 02/13/ 2021. for ductal ca date of diagnosis 02/13/ 2021 . 2. When the only information available is a positive pathology or cytology report, code the date the biopsy was done , not the date the report was dictated or transcribed 3. The first diagnosis of cancer ma y be clinical (i.e., based on clinical findings or physician's documentation) Note: Do not change the date of diagnosis when a cli nical diagnosis is subsequently confirmed by positive histology or cytology. Example: On May 15, 2021, physician states that patient has lung cancer based on clinical findings. The patient has a positive biopsy of the lung in June 3, 2021. The date of diagnosis remains May 15, 20 21. 4. Positive tumor markers alone are not diagnostic of cancer. Use the date of clinical, histolo gic, or positive cytologic confirmation as the date of diagnosis. Example 1: The patient has an elevated PSA and the physical examination is negative. The physician documents only that the patient is referred for a needle biopsy of the prostate. The biopsy is positive for adenocarcinoma. The date of diagnosis is the date of the biopsy (do not code the date of the PSA or the date the procedure was dictated or transcribed). Example 2: The patient has an elevated PSA and the physical examination is negative. The physician documents that he/she suspects that the patient has prostatic cancer and is referring the patient for a needle biopsy. The needle biopsy is positive, confirming the physician's suspicion of cancer. The date of diagnosis is the date the physici an documented that he/she suspects that the patient has prostatic cancer. Note: Positive tumor markers alone are never used for case ascertainment. 5. Do not use cytology as a basis for diagnosis when ambiguous terms are used. Ambiguous cytology is not diagnostic of cancer. Use the date of clinical, histologic, or positive cytologic confirmation as the date of diagnosis. Note 1: \"Ambiguous\" cytology means that the diagnosis is preceded by an ambiguous term such as apparently, appears, compatible with, etc. Note 2: Do not use ambiguous cytology alone for case ascertainment. SEER Program Coding and Staging Manual 2021 Section IV : Description of this Neoplasm 82 6. Code the earlier date as the date of diagnosis when a. A recognized medical practitioner says that, in retrospect , the patient had cancer at an earlier date or b. The original slides are reviewed and the pathologist documents that cancer was present. Code the date of the original procedure as the diagnosis date. Example: The patient had an excision of a benign fibrous histiocytoma in January 2021. Six months later, a wide re -excision was positive for malignant fibrous histiocytoma. The physician documents in the chart that the previous tumor must have been malignant. Code the diagnosis date as January 20 21. Note: Do not back-date the diagnosis when The information on the previous tumor is unclear AND/OR There is no review of previous slides AND/OR There is no physician's statement that, in retrospect, the previous tumor was malignant Example: The patient had a total hysterectomy and a bilateral salpingo- oophorectomy (BSO) in June 2021 with pathology diagnosis of papillary cystadenoma of the ovaries. In December 2021, the patient is diagnosed with widespread metastatic papillary cystadenocarcinoma. The slides from June 2021 are not reviewed and th ere is no physician statement saying the previous tumor was malignant. The date of diagnosis is December 2021. 7. Code the date of death as the date of diagnosis for autopsy- only cases 8. Death certificate only (DCO) Cases a. Use information on the death certificat e to estimate the date of diagnosis b. Record the date of death as the date of diagnosis when there is not enough information available to estimate the date of diagnosis; for example, the time from onset to the date of death is described as 'years' c. If no info rmation is available, record the date of death as the date of diagnosis 9. Estimate the date of diagnosis if an exact date is not available. Use all information available to calculate the month and year of diagnosis. a. Estimating the month i. Code \"spring\" to Apri l ii. Code \"summer\" or \"middle of the year\" to July iii. Code \"fall\" or \"autumn\" as October iv. For \"winter\" try to determine whether the physician means the first of the year or the end of the year and code January or December as appropriate. If no determination can be made, use whatever information is available to calculate the month of diagnosis. v. Code \"early in year\" to January vi. Code \"late in year\" to December vii. Use whatever information is available to calculate the month of diagnosis Example 1: Admit ted October 20 21. History states that the patient was diagnosed 7 months ago. Subtract 7 from the month of admission and code date of diagnosis to March 2021 . SEER Program Coding and Staging Manual 2021 Section IV : Description of this Neoplasm 83 Example 2: Outpatient bone scan done January 2021 that states history of prostate cancer. The physician says the patient was diagnosed in 2021. Assume bone scan was part of initial work -up and code date of diagnosis to January 2021 . viii. Code the month of admission when there is no basis for estimation ix. Leave month blank (or convert 99 to blank) if there is no basis for approximation b. Estimating the year i. Code \"a couple of years\" to two years earlier ii. Code \"a few years\" to three years earlier iii. Use whatever information is available to calculate the year of diagnosis iv. Code the year of admission when there i s no basis for estimation 10. If no information about the date of diagnosis is available a. Case transmitted to NCI SEER i. Use the date of admission as the date of diagnosis ii. In the absence of an admission date, code the date of first treatment as the date of diagnosis b. Case NOT transmitted to NCI SEER i. Code month and year as unknown Nursing Home and Hospice Residents (Not hospitalized for their cancer; no information other than nursing home or hospice records and/or death certificate) 1. Use the best approximation for the date of diagnosis when the only information available is that the patient had cancer while in the nursing home and it is unknown whether the patient had cancer when admitted 2. Code the date of admission to the nursing home as the date of diagnosis when a. The only information available is that the patient had cancer when admitted to the nursing home b. The only information available is that the patient had cancer while in the nursing home, it is unknown whether the patient had cancer when admitted, and there is no basis for approximation Cases Diagnosed Before Birth Record the actual date of diagnosis for diagnoses made in utero even though this date will precede the date of birth. Example: Fetal intrahepatic mass consistent with hepatob lastoma diagnosed via ultrasound at 39 weeks gestation ( 01/30/2021). Live birth by C -section 02/04/2021 . Code the date of diagnosis as 01/30/2021 . Note : Prenatal diagnoses are reportable when there is a live birth.

SEER Program Coding and Staging Manual 2021 Section IV : Description of this Neoplasm 86 Type of Neoplasm/Sequence Number Series Neoplasm Sequence Number --Central Numeric Series Series 1: In situ/malignant as Federally required 00-59, 99 All in situ (behavior code 2) excluding Cervix CIS, CIN III , SIN III of cervix All other in situ including VIN III, VAIN III, AIN III Malignant (behavior code 3) Juvenile astrocytoma (diagnosis year 2001 and later)* Invasive following in situ - new primary defined by SEER 00-59 Unspecified Federally required sequence number or unknown 99 Series 2: Non -malignant tumor as Federally required or sta te or regional registry defined ** 60-87, 88 Examples Non-malignant tumor/benign brain /intracranial 2001+) 60-87 Cervix CIS/CIN III , SIN III of cervix Note : Submission of in situ cervical cancer is no longer required as of 2018 NCI SEER data submission. 60-87 Unspecified non -malignant tumor or central registry -defined sequence number 88 * Juvenile astrocytomas should be reported as 9421/3. **Series 2 - The only tumors in Series 2 that SEER requires are benign/borderline intracranial and central nervous system (CNS) tumors. Note: Conversion Guidance Do not change t he sequence numbers for neoplasms whose histology codes were associated with behavior codes that changed from in situ/malignant to benign/borderline or vice versa during the conversion from ICD-O-2 to ICD -O-3 or the conversion from ICD -O-3 to ICD -O-3.2. In situ/Malignant Coding Instructions 1. Count all previous and current in situ/malignant reportable primaries which occur(red) over the lifetime of the patient, regardless of where he/she lived at diagnosis a. A 'reportable' primary refers to the site/histology/behavior of the tumor and the years when reporting was required. Review of the reportability requirements in effect during the diagnosis year will be needed. 2. Code 00 when there is only one primary in the patient's lifetime 3. Sequence in situ/malignant primaries chronologically as 01 (first of one or more), 02 (second primary), 03 (third primary), and assign the appropriate sequence number to all primaries in the database when there are multiple primaries Example 1: The patient has a history of breast cancer in 1999. She has colon cancer in 2010. Assign sequence number 02 to the colon cancer and change the sequence number on the breast cancer from 00 to 01. SEER Program Coding and Staging Manual 2021 Section IV : Description of this Neoplasm 87 Example 2: In 1987, patient was diagnosed and treated for childhood leukemia in another state. After becoming a resident of a SEER region , the patient develops bladder cancer. The SEER registry assigns a sequence number of 02 to the bladder cancer. Document the first diagnosis in a text field. a. Change the sequence number of the first primary from 00 to 01 when one patient has a primary with sequence 00 and then develops another reportable /2 or /3 primary b. Exception : There are certain cancers that were only reportable for some years. The following are some examples (not a complete list) Borderline tumors of the ovary were reported for 1992- 2000 o Sequence 00 -59 Refractory anemia is reported only for 2001+ Myelodysplastic reported only for 2001+ Newly reportable hematopoietic neoplasms as of 01/01/2010 4. Assign the lower sequence number to the primary with the worse prognosis when two primaries are diagnosed simultaneously a. Base the prognosis decision on the primary site, histology, and extent of disease for each of the primaries b. If there is no difference in prognosis, the sequence numbers may be assigned in any order Non-Malignant Coding Instructions 1. Include all non- malignant primary intracranial /CNS tumors diagnosed in 2004 and forward regardless of where the patient lived at diagnosis 2. Assign sequence number 60 when there are no prior or subsequent non- malignant intracranial /CNS tumors a. The sequence number is 60 when a patient has only one reportable non- malignant tumor. If a tumor has a sequence of 60 and there is another reportable non- malignant tumor, change the sequence number of the first primary from 60 to 61. 3. Assign sequence numbers in chronological order according to the order in which they occur(red). Reportable benign and borderline intracranial /CNS tumors are restricted to primary site codes C700- C729, C751- C753 with behavior codes of /0 or /1. 4. Sequence multiple non- malignant tumors chronologically as 61 (first of two or more), 62 (second), etc. 5. Sequence a non -malignant intracranial /CNS tumor and a malignant intracranial /CNS tumor ( /2 or /3) independently when one patient has both. The non- malign ant tumor has a sequence number of 60 and the malignant (/2 or /3) tumor has a sequence number of 00. 6. Sequence tumors other than those required by SEER in the 60- 87 range when a registry chooses to collect non -reportable tumors. These non- reportable tumors are often referred to as \"Reportable by agreement.\" Example: Cervix in situ was diagnosed in 2003 and lung cancer was diagnosed in 2021. The cervix in situ, if collected by the registry, would be a sequence number 60 and the lung would be assigned a seque nce number of 00. Note : Sequence all cervix in situ cases in the 60 -87 range regardless of diagnosis year. Submission of in situ cervical cancer is no longer required as of 2018 NCI SEER data submission. SEER Program Coding and Staging Manual 2021 Section IV : Description of this Neoplasm 88 Primary Site Item Length: 4 NAACCR Item NAACCR Name: NAACCR ID: primarySite For cases diagnosed 01/01/ 2001 and later, code the primary site using the topography codes listed in the International Classification of Diseases for Oncology , Third Edition (ICD -O-3). The current Solid Tumor Rules contain additional coding instructions for some primary sites , including Head and Neck, Lung, and Urinary . Note : Continue to use ICD -O-3 for assigning topography codes. ICD -O-3.2 did not change any of the topography codes. The ICD -O-3 has topography codes listed in two sections; the first is a numeric listing by code number, the second is an alphabetic listing by anatomic site. The topography code consists of a lead character (the letter 'C') followed by two numeric digits, a decimal point, and then one additional numeric digit. The decimal point is not entered as part of the code. Example: The pathology report says the primary site is the cardia of the stomach. The code C16.0 is found in the Alphabetic Index under either \"stomach\" or \"cardia.\" Enter the code as C160; do not record the decimal point. Coding Instructions for Solid Tumors See the Coding Guidelines for Topography and Morphology in the introduction of the ICD -O-3 for additional details. Refer also to the current Solid Tumor Rules for selected primary site coding instructions. 1. Unless otherwise instructed, use all available information in the medical record to code the site 2. Code the site in which the primary t umor originated , even if it extends onto/into an adjacent subsite a. Primary site should always be coded to reflect the site of origin according to the medical opinion on the case. Look for information about where the neoplasm originated. Always code the pri mary site based on where the tumor arose / site of origin. b. Site of origin may be indicated by terms such as \"tumor arose from...,\" \"tumor originated in...,\" or similar statements c. Site of origin is not necessarily the site of a biopsy d. Tumors may involve many sites. The primary site code should reflect the site where the tumor arose rather than all of the sites of involvement. Example 1: Final diagnosis is adenocarcinoma of the upper lobe of the right lung. Code the topography to lung, upper lobe (C341). Example 2: The patient has a 4 cm tumor in the right breast. The tumor originated in the upper inner quadrant and extends into the lower inner quadrant. Code the primary site to upper inner quadrant of breast (C502). Example 3: Patient has a right branchial cleft cyst; the pathology report identifies an adenocarcinoma arising in an ectopic focus of thyroid tissue within the branchial cleft cyst. Thyroidectomy pathology is negative. Code the primary site to branchial cleft (C104). Example 4: The patient had a tot al hysterectomy with a bilateral salpingo -oophorectomy ten years ago for non- cancer reasons. She now has widespread cystadenocarcinoma in the SEER Program Coding and Staging Manual 2021 Section IV : Description of this Neoplasm 89 peritoneum. Code the primary site to peritoneum, NOS (C482). (The chart may or may not state that the patient has extra- ovarian carcinoma.) Example 5: Pathology report shows adenocarcinoma arising in a patch of endometriosis on the sigmoid colon. Code the primary site to sigmoid colon (C187), the site in which the cancer originated. Example 6: The patient has a l eft lower lip wedge excision showing invasive squamous cell carcinoma at the mucocutaneous junction. There is no further info rmation in operative report or pathology report regarding the location of this tumor that would indicate this is a skin primary . Assign C001, e xternal lower lip. C001 includes vermilion border of lower lip. Vermilion border is synonymous with mucocutaneous junction. 3. Code the last digit of the primary site code to '8' when a single tumor overlaps an adjacent subsite (s) of an organ and the point of origin cannot be determined Example: The patient has a primary tumor of the cervicothoracic esophagus and the point of origin is unknown. Code the primary site to C158. Note: Skin cancers overlapping sites in the head and neck ONLY . Assign the primary site code for the site where the bulk of the tumor is or where the epicenter is; do not use code C448 . 4. Code the site of the invasive tumor when there is an invasive tumor and also in situ tumor in different subsites of the same anatomic site Example 1: Patient has an invasive breast tumor in the upper -outer quadrant of the left breast and in situ tumor in multiple quadrants of the left breast. Code the primary site to C504 (upper outer quadrant of breast). Example 2: Patient has in situ Paget disease of the right nipple and invasive duct carcinoma of the lower inner quadrant of the right breast. Code the pri mary site to C503 (lower inner quadrant). 5. Code the last digit of the primary site code to '9' for single primaries , when multiple tumors arise in different subsites of the same anatomic site and the point of origin cannot be determined Example 1: During a transurethral resection of the bladder (TURB), the physician describes multiple papillary tumors in the bladder neck (C675) and the lateral wall of the bladder (C672). Code the primary site as bladder, NOS (C679). Example 2: Patient has an infiltrating duc t tumor in the upper outer quadrant (C504) of the right breast and another infiltrating duct carcinoma in the lower inner (C503) quadrant of the right breast. Code the primary site as breast, NOS (C509). 6. Some histology/behavior terms in ICD -O-3.2 have a related site code in parentheses; for example, hepatoma (C220) a. Code the site as documented in the medical record and ignore the suggested ICD -O-3.2 code when a primary site is specified in the medical record Example: The path report says \"infiltrating duct c arcinoma of the head of pancreas.\" The in ICD -O-3.2 is infiltrating duct carcinoma 8500/3 (C50_). Code the primary site to head of pancreas (C250), NOT to breast (C50_) as suggested by the ICD -O-3.2. b. Use the site code suggested by ICD -O-3.2 when the primary site is the same as the site code suggested or the primary site is unknown Example 1: The biopsy is positive for hepatoma, and no information is available about the primary site. Code the primary site to liver (C220) as suggested by ICD -O-3.2. Example 2: E xcision of the right axillary nodes reveals metastatic infiltrating duct carcinoma. The right breast is negative. ICD -O-3.2 shows infiltrating duct carcinoma SEER Program Coding and Staging Manual 2021 Section IV : Description of this Neoplasm 90 (8500) with a suggested site of breast (C50_). Code the primary site as breast, NOS (C509). c. Use the site code suggested by ICD -O-3.2 when there is no information available indicating a different primary site Example : Biopsy of lymph node diagnosed as metastatic non- small cell carcinoma. Patient expired and there is n o information available about the primary site. Assign C349 based on the site code suggested in ICD -O-3.2. 7. Code the primary site, not the metastatic site. If a tumor is metastatic and the primary site is unknown, code the primary site as unknown (C809) . 8. See the site- specific coding guidelines in Appendix C for primary site coding guidelines for the following sites Bladder Kaposi Sarcoma of All Sites Breast Lung Colon Rectosigmoid Junction Esophagus 9. See section below for primary site coding guidelines for sarcoma 10. Angiosarcoma a. Code C422 (spleen) as the primary site for angiosarcoma of spleen b. Code C50_ (breast) for angiosarcoma of breast. Although angiosarcoma actual ly originates in the lining of the blood vessels, an angiosarcoma originating in the breast has a poorer prognosis than many other breast tumors. 11. Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumors (GIST): Code the primary site to the location where the GIST originated 12. Transp lants a. Code the primary site to the location of the transplanted organ w hen a malignancy arises in a transplanted organ, i.e., c ode the primary site to where the malignancy resides or lies Example : There is a diagnosis of malignancy in transplanted section of colon serving as esophagus . Code the primary site as esophagus . Document the situation in a text field. b. For information about organ or tissue transplants, see the section Determining Multiple Primaries c. For additional information about hematopoietic -related transplants, refer to the Hematopoietic and Lymphoid Neoplasm Coding Manual and Database 13. Assign primary site code C449, skin NOS, for a Merkel cell carcinoma presenting in a nodal or distant metastatic site and site of origin is unknown 14. In the absence of any additional information about the primary site, assign the codes listed for these primary sites /histologies Primary Book -leaf lesion (mouth) C068 Clavicular skin C445 Colored / lipstick portion of upper lip C000 SEER Program Coding and Staging Manual 2021 Section IV : Description of this Neoplasm pancreas C250 15. When the medical record does not contain enough information to assign a primary a. Consult a physician advisor to assign the site code b. Use the NOS category for the organ system or the Ill -Defined Sites (C760- C768) if the physician advisor cannot identify a primary site Occult Tumors of the Head and Neck Assign primary site C119 (nasopharynx) for occult head and neck tumors with cervical lymph node metastasis in Levels I -VII, and other group lymph nodes positive for Epstein -Barr virus (EBV+) (regardless of p16 status) encoded small RNAs (EBER) identi fied by in situ hybridization. Assign primary site C109 (oropharynx) for occult head and neck tumors with cervical lymph node metastasis in Levels I -VII, and other group lymph nodes, p16 positive with histology consistent with HPV -mediated oropharyngeal carcinoma (OPC). Assign C760 for Occult Head and Neck primaries with positive cervical lymph nodes. Schema Discriminator 1: O ccult Head and Neck Lymph Nodes is used to discriminate between these cases and other uses of C760. For more information about schemas and schema IDs, go to the SSDI Manual , Appendix A. c. Assign the NOS code for the body system when there are two or more possible primary sites documented and all are within the same system Example : Two possible sites are documented in the GI system such as colon and small intestine ; code to the GI tract, NOS (C269 ). Document the possible primary sites in a text field. SEER Program Coding and Staging Manual 2021 Section IV : Description of this Neoplasm 92 d. Code unknown primary site when there is a physician statement of unknown primary site ONLY when none of the above instructions can be applied e. Code Unknown Primary Site (C809) if there is not enough information to assign an NOS or Ill -Defined Site category Sarcoma The majority of sarcomas arise in mesenchymal or connective tissues that are located in the musculoskeletal system, which includes the fat, muscles, blood vessels, deep skin tissues, nerves, bones, and cartilage. The default code for sarcomas of unknown primary site is C499 rather than C809. Sarcomas may also arise in the walls of hollow organs and in the viscera covering an organ. Code the primary site to the organ of origin. Example 1: The pathology identifies a carcinosarcoma of the uterine corpus. Code the primary site to corpus uteri (C549). Example 2: Rhabdomyosarcoma of ethmoid sinus. Code primary site to C311. Code the organ of origin as the primary site when leiomyosarcoma arises in an organ. Do not code soft tissue as the primary site in this situation. Example 1: Leiomyosarcoma arises in kidney. Code the primary site to kidney (C649). Example 2: Leiomyosarcoma arises in prostate. Code primary site to prostate ( C619). Coding Instructions for Hematopoietic and See the Hematopoietic and Lymphoid Neoplasm Coding Manual and Database for instructions on coding the primary site for hematopoietic and lymphoid neoplasms. SEER Program Coding and Staging Manual 2021 Section IV : Description of this Neoplasm 93 Laterality Length: Lateralit y describes the side of a paired organ or side of the body on which the reportable tumor originated. Determine whether laterality should be coded for each primary. Code Description 0 Not a paired site 1 Right: origin of primary 2 Left: origin of primary 3 Only one side involved, right or left origin unspecified 4 Bilateral involvement at time of diagnosis, lateral origin unknown for a single primary; or both ovaries involved simultaneously, single histology; bilateral retinoblastomas; bilateral Wilms tumors 5 Paired site: midline tumor (eff ective with 01/01/2010 dx) 9 Paired site, but no information concerning laterality Coding Instructions 1. Assign code 0 when a. The primary site is not a paired site b. Primary site is unknown (C809), or c. Laterality is unknown for a death certificate only (DCO) case and the primary site is using codes 1 -9 for all sites listed in the table: Sites for Which Laterality Codes Must Be Recorded a. Laterality may be coded for sites other than those required; for example, thyroid 3. Code the side where the primary tumor originated a. Assign code 3 if the laterality is not known but the tumor is confined to a single side of the paired organ Example : Pathology report: Patient has a 2 cm carcinoma in the upper pole of the kidney. Code laterality as 3 because there is documentation that the disease exists in only one kidney, but it is unknown if the disease originated in the right or left kidney. 4. Code 4 is seldom used EXCEPT for the following a. Both ovaries involved simultaneously with a single histology, or epithelial histologies (8000- 8799) b. Diffuse bilateral lung nodules c. Bilateral retinoblastomas d. Bilateral Wilms tumors 5. Assign code 5 when the tumor originates in the midline of a site listed in 5.a SEER Program Coding and Staging Manual 2021 Section IV : Description of this Neoplasm 94 a. C700, C710- C714, C722- C725, C 443, C445 i. Do not assign code 5 to sites not listed in 5.a Example 1: Patient has an excision of a melanoma located just above the umbilicus (C445, laterality code 5). Example 2: Patient has a midline meningioma of the cerebral meninges (C700, laterality code 5). 6. Assign code 9 when a. The neoplasm originated in a paired site and i. Laterality is unknown, AND ii. There is no statement that only one side of the paired organ is involved Example 1: Admitting history says patient was diagnosed with lung cancer based on positive sputum cytology. Patient is treated for painful bony metastases. There is no information about laterality in the diagnosis of this lung cancer. Example 2: Widely metastatic ovarian carcinoma surgically debulked. Ovaries could not be identified in the specimen. b. Laterality is unknown for a death certificate only (DCO) case with primary laterality in a text field Sites for Which Laterality Codes Must Be Recorded Starting with cases diagnosed January 1, 2004 and later, laterality is coded for select invasive, benign, and borderline primary intracranial and CNS tumors. A laterality code other than 0 must be assigned for the sites listed in the table below . There is an effective date for assigning laterality for some of the sites. If the site is not listed on the table, code 0 may be assigned for laterality. Laterality may be coded for sites other than those required below . For example: Code 2 may be assigned for a tumor originating in the left lobe of thyroid.

The best method could occur at any time throughout the entire course of the disease. It is not limited to the confirmation at the time of initial diagnosis. Note: The codes and instructions for hematopoietic and lymphoid neoplasms are different from the codes for solid tumors. Codes and instructions for solid tumors follow . See the section Codes for Hematopoietic and Lymphoid Neoplasms for hematopoietic and lymphoid neoplasms diagnostic confirmation codes . Codes for Solid Tumors Microscopically Confirmed Code Description 1 Positive histology 2 Positive cytology 4 Positive microscopic confirmation, method not specified Not Microscopically Confirmed Code Description 5 Positive laboratory test/marker study 6 Direct visualization without microscopic confirmation 7 Radiology and other imaging techniques without microscopic confirmation 8 Clinical diagnosis only (other than 5, 6, or 7) Confirmation Unknown Code Description 9 Unknown whether or not microscopically confirmed; death certificate only Coding Instructions for Solid Tumors 1. The codes are in priority order; code 1 has the highest priority. Always code the procedure with the lower numeric value when presence of cancer is confirmed with multiple diagnostic methods. 2. Change to a higher -priority code, if at ANY TIME during the course of disease the patient has a diagnostic confirmation with a higher priority . Change to the higher -priority code even when diagnostic confirmation is based on the result of subsequent treatment. Example: Benign brain tumor diagnosed on MRI. Assign diagnostic confirmation code 7. Patient later becomes symptomatic and the tumor is surgically removed. Change diagnostic confirmation code to 1. 3. Assign code 1 when the microscopic diagnosis is based on a. Tissue specimens from fine needle aspirate, biopsy, surgery, autopsy, or D&C SEER Program Coding and Staging Manual 2021 Section IV : Description of this Neoplasm 97 b. Bone marrow specimens (aspiration and biopsy) 4. Assign code 2 when the microscopic diagnosis is based on a. Examination of cells (rather than tissue) including but not peritoneal fluid, pleural fluid, urinary sediment, cervical smears, or vaginal smears b. Paraffin block specimens from concentrated spinal, pleural, or peritoneal fluid 5. Assign code 4 when there is information that the diagnosis of cancer was microscopically confirmed, but the type of confirmation is unknown 6. Assign code 5 when the diagnosis of cancer is based on laboratory tests or tumor marker studies that are clinically diagnostic for that specific cancer and there is no other diagnostic work up (e.g., imaging) Example: If the workup for a prostate cancer patient is limited to a highly elevated PSA (no DRE and no imaging) and the physician diagnoses and/or treats the patient based only on that PSA, code the diagnostic confirmation to 5. Note: For tests and tumo r markers that may be used to help diagnose cancer, see http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/factsheet/detection http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/factsheet/detection/tumor -markers 7. Assign code 6 when the diagnosis is based only on a. The surgeon's operative report from a surgical exploration or endoscopy such as colonoscopy, mediastinoscopy, or peritoneoscopy and no tissue was examined b. Gross autopsy findings (no tissue or cytologic confirmation) 8. Assign code 7 when the only confirmation of malignancy was diagnostic imaging such as computerized axial tomography (CT scans), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI scans), or ultrasounds/sonography 9. Assign code 8 when the case was diagnosed by any clinical method not mentioned in preceding codes. The diagnostic confirmation is coded 8 when the only confirmation of disease is a physician's clinical diagnosis. Example: CT diagnosis is possible lung cancer. Patient returns to the nursing home with a Do Not Resuscitate (DNR) order. Physician enters a diag nosis of lung cancer in the medical record. Code the diagnostic confirmation to 8: there is a physician's clinical diagnosis - clinical diagnosis made by the physician using the information available for the case. 10. Assign code 9 a. When it is unknown if the diagnosis was confirmed microscopically b.

SEER Program Coding and Staging Manual 2021 Section IV : Description of this Neoplasm 100 Histologic Type ICD- Histologic Type ICD -O-3 describes the microscopic composition of cells and/or tissue for a specific primary. The current Solid Tumor Rules , the Hematopoietic and Lymphoid Neoplasm Coding Manual and Database , and the International Classification of Diseases for Oncology , Third Edition, Second Revision Morphology (ICD -O-3.2) are the standard references for histology codes. ICD-O-3.2 For 2021, s tandard setters have agreed to implement new histology terms and codes for ICD -O-3 based on the current versions of the World Health Organization Classification of Tumors . The update, referred to as ICD-O-3.2, includes comprehensive tables listing histology code s and behavior codes in effect beginning with cases diagnosed in 2021. The new codes, new terms, and codes with changes to behavior are available at the NAACCR website .

See also the NAACCR 2015 Implementation Guide lines and Recommendations: The Hematopoietic Conversion Documentation . SEER Program Coding and Staging Manual 2021 Section IV : Description of this Neoplasm 101 Behavior Code Item Length: 1 NAACCR Item NAACCR ID: behaviorCodeIcdO3 The data item Behavior Code describes the malignant potential of the tumor, ranging from /0 benign to /3 malignant (invasive). Code Description 0 Benign (Reportable for intracranial and CNS sites only) 1 Uncertain whether benign or malignant, borderline malignancy, low malignant potential, and uncertain malignant potential (Reportable for intracranial and CNS sites only) 2 Carcinoma in situ; intraepithelial; noninfiltrating; non -invasive (carcinoma) 3 Malignant, primary site (invasive) Coding Instructions Intracranial and CNS tumors Intracranial and CNS tumors with behavior codes 0 (benign) and 1 (borderline malignancy) are reportable beginning with January 1, 2004 diagnoses. Code the behavior from CT scan, Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), or Positron Emission Tomography (PET) report when there is no tissue diagnosis (pathology or cytology report). Code the behavior listed on the scan. Do not use the WHO grade to code behavior. Metastatic or Non -primary Sites Cases reported to SEER cannot have a metastatic (/6) behavior code. If the only pathologic specimen is from a metastatic site, code the appropriate histology code and the malignant behavior code (/3). The primary site and its metastatic site(s) have the sa me histology. Code the behavior as malignant (/3) when malignant metastasis is present. Metastasis could be regional, nodal, or distant. Example : Adenocarcinoma in situ with lymph nodes positive for malignancy. Code the behavior as malignant (/3). Exception : For in situ breast cancer; code as non- invasive ( /2) in the presence of isolated tumor cells or if cells are artifactually displaced from a previous procedure. In Situ Clinical evidence alone cannot identify the behavior as in situ; a behavior code of /2 (in situ) must be based on pathologic examination. SEER Program Coding and Staging Manual 2021 Section IV : Description of this Neoplasm 102 In Situ and Invasive Code the behavior as malignant (/3) if any portion of the primary tumor is invasive no matter how limited, i.e., microinvasion. Example: Pathology from mastect omy: Large mass composed of intraductal carcinoma with a single focus of invasion. Code the behavior as malignant (/3). Re-code the behavior as malignant (/3) when metastases are attributed to a tumor originally thought to be in situ. Example: Right colon biopsy reveals tubulovillous adenoma with microfocal carcinoma in situ; right hemicolectomy is negative for residual disease. Later core liver biopsy consistent with metastatic adenocarcinoma of gastrointestinal origin. Oncologist states most likely colo n primary. Change the behavior code for the colon primary from /2 to /3. There were no other colon primaries in this case. ICD-O-3.2 Histology/Behavior Code Listing Behavior is the fifth digit of the morphology code after the slash (/). The standard reference for coding behavior is the ICD -O-3.2. Pages 27 through 30 in ICD -O-3 discuss behavior. The following general rules are found on pages 29- 30 in ICD -O-3. Usually a histologic term carries a clear indication of the likely behavior of the tumor, whether malignant or benign, and this is reflected in the behavior code assigned to it in the ICD -O Although only a few histologic types of in situ neoplasms are actually listed in the ICD -O, the behavior code /2 could be attached to any histology code if an in situ form of the neoplasm is diagnosed If the pathologist disagrees with the ICD -O behavior assignment in a particular case, code the behavior according to the pathologist's description of the behavior even if that histology/behavior combination is not listed in the ICD -O The pathologist has the final say on the behavior of the tumor. ICD-O-3 may have only one behavior code, in situ (/2) or malignant (/3), listed for a specific histology. If the pathology report describes the histology as in situ and the ICD -O-3 histology code is listed only with a malignant behavior code (/3), assign the in situ behavior code (/2). If the pathology report describes histology as malignant and the ICD -O-3 histology code is listed only with an in situ behavior code (/2), assign the malignant behavior code (/3). See the Morphology and Behavior Code Matrix discussion on page 29 in ICD -O-3. Example: The pathology report says large cell carcinoma in situ. The ICD -O-3 lists large cell carcino ma only with a malignant behavior ( 8012/3). Code the histology and behavior as 8012/2 as specified by the pathologist.

SEER Program Coding and Staging Manual 2021 Section IV : Description of this Neoplasm 108 Tumor Size --Clinical Item Length: 3 NAACCR XML NAACCR ID: tumorSizeClinical This data item records the size of a solid primary tumor before any treatment (surgical resection or initiation of any treatment including neoadjuvant). Clinical classification is composed of diagnostic workup prior to first treatment, including physical e xamination, imaging, pathological findings (gross and microscopic measurements), and surgical exploration without resection. Clinical tumor size (pre -treatment size) is essential for treatment decision making and prognosis determination for many types of cancer. Tumor size is required for all solid tumors. Code Description 000 No mass/tumor found 001 1 mm or described as less than 1 mm (0.1 cm or less than 0.1 cm) 002-988 Exact size in millimeters (2 mm to 988 mm) (0.2 to 98.8 cm) 989 989 millimeters or larger (98.9 cm or larger) 990 Microscopic focus or foci only and no size of focus is given 998 Alternate descriptions of tumor size for specific sites : Familial/multiple Junction (C16.0- C16.6, C16.8- C16.9) Diffuse, entire lung Unknown; size not stated Not documented in patient record Size of tumor cannot be assessed The only measurement(s) describes pieces or chips Not applicable Coding Instructions 1. Code the clinical tumor size using all information (reports) available during the detection and diagnostic confirmation of the tumor. Information prior to the date of diagnosi s may be used if it is part of the workup for this primary tumor. a. The only exception is when there is progression of disease ; use the measurements (size) closest to the day of diagnosis for coding clinical tumor size SEER Program Coding and Staging Manual 2021 Section IV : Description of this Neoplasm 109 Example : There is a screening mammography and a diagnosing mammography, and the size from the la tter is the largest measurement. Use the value from the diagnosing mammography (the larger size). 2. Document clinical tumor size before any form of treatment , in the priority order that follows Priori ty of recording clinical tumor size a. Operative report from surgical exploration without resection b. Imaging- guided tissue biopsy (i.e., incisional biopsy done under imaging) i. Do not use the size from a core biopsy or needle biopsy for clinical tumor size unless you are confident that the size corresponds to the tumor rather than the size of the specimen obtained. Core biops ies and needle biopsies do not necessarily obtain enough tissue to know the actual tumor size. Example : Prostate biopsy, pathologist states core 1: tumor involves 8 mm of core; core 2: tumor involves 3 mm of core. The sizes reported (8 mm and 3 mm) do not represent the size of the prostate tumor. Look for a tumor size on imaging or elsewhere for this case. Note : An incisional biopsy tha t removed the whole tumor is actually an excisional biopsy. Record excisional biopsy tumor size in Tumor Size --Pathologic . Example : A right back biopsy found a Clark level II malignant melanoma, macroscopic tumor size is 0.5 cm. The re- excision found no residual melanoma. The biopsy removed the whole tumor which makes it an excisional biopsy. C ode clinical tumor size as 999 and path tumor size as 005 . c. Diagnostic imaging Use the largest size from available diagnostic imaging procedures in no priority order unless the physician specifies the imaging procedure that is most accurate. Examples include: MRI, ultrasound, mammography, CT, PET , x-ray. d. Physical exam Use in the absence of surgical exploration, imaging from incisional biopsy, and diagnostic imaging . Tumor size from a n endoscopy (e.g. , colonoscopy) is included under physical exam. 3. Clinical tumor size follows the timing rules for A JCC clinical staging. For clinical tumor size, take into consideration what the physician would use to assign clinical stage. Refer to AJCC TNM guidelines to determine the sources of information that pertain to the clinical staging timeframe . Example: TURB T for a bladder primary pertains to clinical staging. A size from a TURBT would be a clinical size. Note : Do not infer the tumor size from the T category . 4. Code the largest size of the primary tumor before neoadjuvant treatment Example: Patient has a 2.2 cm (22 mm) mass in the oropharynx; fine needle aspiration of mass confirms squamous cell carcinoma. Patient receives a course of neoadjuvant combination chemotherapy. Pathologic size of tumor after total resection is 2.8 cm (28 mm). Reco rd clinical tumor size as 022 (22 mm) as that is the largest tumor size that was recorded before treatment occurred , since the pathologic resection is after the neoadjuvant therapy. 5. If no treatment is administered , use t he size from all information availab le within four months of the date of diagnosis using the priority order , and in the absence of disease progression SEER Program Coding and Staging Manual 2021 Section IV : Description of this Neoplasm 110 6. Record the size of the invasive component of the tumor , even if it is smaller, when both an in situ and an invasive component are present and the invasive component is measured 7. Record t umor size using the largest dimension of the tumor, not the depth or thickness of the tumor 8. Record the size of the primary tumor, including contiguous tumor tissue extension, at the time of diagnosis 9. Always code the size of the primary tumor, not the size of the polyp, ulcer, cyst, or distant metastasis. However, when the tumor is described as a \"cystic mass or polypoid mass,\" and only the size of the entire mass is given, code the size of the entire mass, since the cysts or polyps are part of the tumor itself. 10. For breast tumors, clinical size may be reco rded based on the size of a non- mass enhancement (NME). NME is defined as an enhancing abnormality that is not associated with the three - dimensional volume of a mass, shape and outlining, and it is separate from the Background Parenchymal Enhancement (BPE) . 11. Multifocal/multicentric tumors: Code the size of the largest invasive tumor, or the largest in situ tumor if all tumors are in situ, when the tumor is multi- focal or when multiple tumors are reported as a single primary. 12. Code the size of the largest foc us when there is microinvasion. Code 990 when there is microinvasion and no size given. 13. Record tumor size only in millimeters (mm). Convert to millimeters from centimeters when size of tumor is measured in centimeters. Often measurements are given in centi meters and must be converted to millimeters, such as 2 cm ; code as 020. 14. Record the size stated when tumor size is described as \"at least\" a certain size. Record 003 for a tumor size of at least 3 mm. 15. Record 'less than' OR 'greater than' tumor size a. Record t he tumor size as one mm less than stated when tumor size is reported as \"less than x mm \" or \"less than x cm\" Example : If size is < 10 mm, code size as 009 . i. Often measurements are given in centimeters and must be converted to millimeters, such as < 1 cm (<1 0 mm), which is coded as 009; or < 2 cm (<20 mm), which is coded as 019 ii. Code 001 when stated as less than 1 mm b. Record the tumor size as one mm more than stated when tumor size is reported as \"more than x mm\" or \"more than x cm\" Example : , if size is > 10 mm, code size as 011 . i. Often measurements are given in centimeters and must be converted to millimeters such as: > 1 cm (> 10 mm), code as 011; or > 2 cm (> 20 mm), code as 021 ii. Code 989 when described as anything greater than 989 mm (98.9 cm) 16. Record \"between\" tumor sizes as the midpoint between the two measurements when tumor size is reported to be between two sizes; i.e., add the two sizes together and divide by two Note : The word 'between' must be stated to use this instruction. Example : Tumor size is \"between 2 and 3 cm.\" Code size as 025 since 2 + 3 = 5 divided by 2 = 2.5 cm (25 mm). 17. Record the higher tumor size when stated as a range SEER Program Coding and Staging Manual 2021 Section IV : Description of this Neoplasm 111 Example : Tumor size is 8- 10 mm or tumor size is 8 to 10 mm. Code size as 0 10 since 10 mm is the higher of the values in the range. 18. Avoid coding tumor size based on a description such as \"Mass was present at 22 to 25 cm.\" Descriptions like this are found on endoscopies. Look for an actual measurement of the mass, or a stated tumor size. 19. Round decima ls: Round the tumor size when it is described in fractions (decimals) of millimeters as follows a. When tumor size is greater than 1 millimeter, round tenths of millimeters in the 1 -4 range down to the nearest whole millimeter and round tenths of millimeters in the 5- 9 range up to the nearest whole millimeter. b. Do not round tumor size expressed in centimeters to the nearest whole centimeter; rather, convert the measurement to millimeters by moving the decimal point one space to the right Note 1: Record tumor si ze as 001 (do not round down to 000) when the largest dimension of a tumor is less than 1 millimeter (greater than 0 mm and less than 1 mm). Note 2 : Code 001 when tumor size is 1 mm . Exception to rounding rules for BREAST primaries : Round tumor sizes greater than 1.0 mm and up to 2.4 mm to 2 mm (002). The purpose of this exception is so that the size recorded in the Tumor Size data item will derive the correct AJCC TNM Primary Tumor (T) category for breast primaries. Do not apply this instruction to any other site. Examples Breast cancer described as 6.5 millimeters in size. Round up to 7 mm and code as 007. Breast cancer described as 1.3 mm in size. Round up to 2 mm and code as 002. 2.3 millimeters cancer in a polyp. Round down to 2 mm and code as 002. Hypopharynx: Focus of cancer described as 1.4 mm in size. Round down to 1 mm and code as 001. 5.2 cm breast cancer. Convert to millimeters (52 mm) and do not round; code as 052 millimeters. 2.5 cm rectal cancer. Do not round, record as 025 millimeters. 20. Assign code 000 when a. Schema is C ervical Lymph Nodes and Unknown Primary 00060 b. EOD Primary Tumor is coded 800 (No evidence of primary tumor) for any schema 21. Assign tumor size for benign and borderline tumors in the schemas B rain, CNS Other, and Intracranial Gland when provided; do not default to 999 22. Assign tumor size code 999 when size is unknown and for the following sites and schemas/schema IDs a.

Record the size of the resected or excised tumor. The tumor size may differ from t he size of the specimen. SEER Program Coding and Staging Manual 2021 Section IV : Description of this Neoplasm 115 Note : An incisional biopsy that removed the whole tumor is actually an excisional biopsy. Record excisional biopsy tumor size in Tumor Size --Pathologic . Example : A right back biopsy found a Clark level II malignant melanoma, macros copic tumor size 0.5cm. The re -excision found no residual melanoma. The biopsy removed the whole tumor, which makes it an excisional biopsy. C ode clinical tumor size as 999 and path tumor size as 005. 2. Record the size of the invasive component, if given a. Record the size of the invasive component, even if it is smaller, when both an in situ and an invasive component are present and the invasive component is measured Example : Tumor is mixed in situ and invasive adenocarcinoma, total 3.7 cm in size, of which 1.4 cm is invasive. Record tumor size as 014 (1.4 cm or 14 mm). b. Record the size of the entire tumor from the surgical report or pathology report when the size of the invasive component is not given Example 1: A breast tumor with infiltrating duct car cinoma with extensive in situ component; total size 2.3 cm. Record tumor size as 023 (2.3 cm or 23 mm). Example 2: Duct carcinoma in situ measuring 1.9 cm with an area of invasive ductal carcinoma. Record tumor size as 019 (1.9 cm = 19 mm). c. Record the size of the primary tumor, including contiguous tumor tissue extension, at the time of diagnosis 3. Code the largest size of the primary tumor measured on the surgical resection specimen when surgery is administered as part of the first definitive treatment Note : Do not use pathologic tumor size from surgery when neoadjuvant therapy has been administered . a. Code the size from the synoptic report (also known as CAP protocol or pathology report checklist) when there is a discrepancy among tumor size measurements in t he various sections of the pathology report b. Use final diagnosis, microscopic, or gross examination, in that order, when no synoptic report is available Example 1: Chest x -ray shows 3.5 cm mass. The pathology report from the lobectomy states RUL lung mass: 2.8 cm adenocarcinoma. Record pathologic tumor size as 028 (28 mm). Example 2: Pathology report states lung carcinoma is 2.1 cm x 3.2 cm x 1.4 cm. Record pathologic tumor size as 032 (32 mm). 4. Tumor size is the largest dimension of the tumor , not the depth or thickness of the tumor 5. Record the largest dimension or diameter of tumor, whether it is from an excisional biopsy specimen or the complete resection of the primary tumor Example : Tumor is described as 2.4 x 5.1 x 1.8 cm in size. Record tumor size as 051 (51 mm). 6. Include pathologic information obtained through completion of definitive surgery when the surgery is part of the first course of treatment 7. Do not use i nformation on size f rom imaging/radiographic techniques to code Tumor Size -- Pathologic SEER Program Coding and Staging Manual 2021 Section IV : Description of this Neoplasm 116 8. Pathologic tumor size follows the timing rules for AJCC pathologic al staging. For pathologic tumor size, take into consideration what the physician would use to assign pathologic al stage. Refer to AJCC TNM guidelines to determine the sources of information that pertain to the pathologic al staging timeframe . Example : Lumpectomy and mastectomy pertain to the pathological timeframe. A size from lumpectomy or mastectomy would be used for the pathologic tumor size . Note : Do not infer the tumor size from the T category . 9. Always code the size of the primary tumor, not the size of the polyp, ulcer, cyst, or distant metastasis. The tumor size may differ from the size of the specimen. However, when the tumor is described as a \"cystic mass\" or \"polypoid mass\" and only the size of the entire mass is given, code the size of the entire mass, since the cysts or polyps are part of the t umor itself. 10. Code the size of the largest focus when there is microinvasion. Code 990 when there is microinvasion and no size given. 11. Record the size as stated for purely in situ lesions 12. Disregard microscopic residual or positive surgical margins when codi ng tumor size. Microscopic residual tumor does not affect overall tumor size. The status of primary tumor margins may be recorded in a separate data item . 13. Multifocal/multicentric tumors: Code the size of the largest invasive tumor, or the largest in situ tumor if all tumors are in situ, when the tumor is multi- focal or when multiple tumors are reported as a single primary. 14. Record tumor size only in millimeters (mm). Convert to millimeters from centimeters when size of tumor is measured in centimeters (cm). Often measurements are given in centimeters and must be converted to millimeters, such as < 1 cm, code as 009; or < 2 cm, code as 019. 15. Record the size stated when tumor size is described as \"at least\" a certain size. Record 003 for a tumor size of at least 3mm. 16. Record 'less than' OR 'greater than' tumor size a.

Often measurements are given in centimeters and must be converted to millimeters, such as < 1 cm, code as 009; or < 2 cm, code as 019 ii. Code 001 when stated as less than 1 mm b. Record the tumor size as one mm more than stated when tumor size is reported as \"more than x mm\" or \"more than x cm\" Example : Size is > 10 mm, code size as 011 . i. Often measurements are given in centimeters and must be converted to millimeters, such as > 1 cm, code as 011; or > 2 cm, code as 021 c. Code 989 when tumor size is greater than 989 mm (98.9 cm) 17. Record \"between\" tumor sizes as the midpoint between the two measurements when tumor size is reported to be between two sizes; i.e., add the two sizes together and divide by two Note: The word \"between\" must be stated to use this instruction . Example : Tumo r size is \" between 2 and 3 cm.\" Code size as 025 since 2 + 3 =5 divided by 2 = 2.5 (or 025 mm). 18. Record the higher tumor size when stated as a range SEER Program Coding and Staging Manual 2021 Section IV : Description of this Neoplasm 117 Example : Tumor size is 8- 10 mm or tumor size is 8 to 10 mm.

When tumor size is greater than 1 millimeter, round tenths of millimeters in the 1 -4 range down to the nearest whole millimeter and round tenths of millimeters in the 5 -9 range up to the nearest whole millimeter . See Exception for breast cancer. b. Do not round tumor size expressed in centimeters to the nearest whole centimeter; rather, convert the measurement to millimeter s by moving the decimal point one space to the right Note 1: Record tumor size as 001 (do not round down to 000) when the largest dimension of a tumor is less than 1 millimeter (between 0.1 and 0.9 mm) . Note 2 : Code 001 when tumor size is 1 mm . Exception t o rounding rules for BREAST primaries : Round tumor sizes greater than 1.0 mm and up to 2.4 mm to 2 mm (002).

For information regarding first course of therapy for hematopoietic and lymphoid neoplasms, refer to the NCI SE ER Hematopoietic and Lymphoid Neoplasm Coding Manual . Definitions Active surveillance: A treatment plan that involves closely watching a patient's condition but not giving any treatment unless there are changes in test results that show the condition is getting worse. Active surveillance may be used to avoid or delay the need for treatments such as radiation therapy or surgery, which can cause side effects or other problems. During active surveillance, certain exams and tests are done on a regular schedule. It may be used in the treatment of certain types of cancer, such as prostate cancer, urethral cancer, and intraocular (eye) melanoma. It is a type of expectant management. Also called active monitoring. (Source: http://www.cancer.gov/dictionary?CdrID=616060 ) Cancer tissue: Proliferating malignant cells; an area of active production of malignant cells. Cancer tissue includes primary tumor and metastatic sites where cancer tissue grows. Cells in fluid such as pleural fluid or ascitic fluid are not \"cancer tissue\" because the cells do not grow and proliferate in the fluid. Concurrent therapy: A treatment that is given at the same time as another. Example : Chemotherapy and radiation therapy Deferred therapy: Closely watching a patient's condition but not giving treatment unless symptoms appear or change, or there are changes in test results. Deferred therapy avo ids problems that may be caused by treatments such as radiation or surgery. It is used to find early signs that the condition is getting worse. During deferred therapy, patients may be given certain exams and tests. It is sometimes used in prostate cancer. Also called expectant management. (Source: http://www.cancer.gov/dictionary?CdrID=667618 ) Disease recurrence: For solid tumors, see the Solid Tumor Rules and for hematopoietic and lymphoid neoplasms see the Hematopoietic and Lymphoid Neoplasm Coding Manual and Database to determine disease recurrence. Expectant management: Closely watching a patient's condition but not giving treatment unless symptoms appear or change, or there are changes in test results. Expectant management avoids problems that may be caused by treatments such as radiation or surgery. It is used to find early signs that the condition is getting worse. During expectant management, patients may be given certain exams and tests. It is sometimes used in prostate cancer. Also called deferred therapy. (Sou rce: http://www.cancer.gov/dictionary?CdrID=616061 ) First course of therapy: All treatments administered to the patient after the original diagnosis of cancer in an attempt to destroy or modify the cancer tissue. See below for detailed information on timing and treatment plan documentation requirements. Hospice: A program that provides special care for people who are near the end of life and for their famili es, either at home, in freestanding facilities, or within hospitals. Hospice care may include treatment that destroys or modifies cancer tissue. If performed as part of the first course, treatment that destroys or modifies cancer tissue is collected when g iven in a hospice setting. \"Hospice, NOS\" is not specific enough to be included as first course treatment. Neoadjuvant therapy: Systemic therapy or radiation therapy given prior to surgery to shrink the tumor. SEER Program Coding and Staging Manual 2021 Section VII: First Course of Therapy 152 Palliative treatment: The World Health Organ ization describes palliative care as treatment that improves the quality of life by preventing or relieving suffering. Note : Palliative therapy is part of the first course of therapy only when it destroys or modifies cancer tissue . Example: The patient was diagnosed with stage IV cancer of the prostate with painful bone metastases. The patient starts radiation treatment intended to shrink the tumor in the bone and relieve the intense pain. The radiation treatments are palliative because they reli eve the bone pain; the radiation is also first course of therapy because it destroys proliferating cancer tissue. Surgical procedure: Any surgical procedure coded in the data item s Surgery of Primary Site, Scope of Regional Lymph Node Surgery, or Surgery of Other Regional or Distant Sites. Treatment: Procedures that destroy or modify primary (primary site) or secondary (metastatic) cancer tissue. Treatment failure: The treatment modalities did not destroy or modify the cancer cells. The tumor either became larger (disease progression) or stayed the same size after treatment. Watchful waiting: Closely watching a patient's condition but not giving treatment unless symptoms appear or change. Watchful waiting is sometimes used in conditions that prog ress slowly. It is also used when the risks of treatment are greater than the possible benefits. During watchful waiting, patients may be given certain tests and exams. Watchful waiting is sometimes used in prostate cancer. It is a type of expectant management.

Use the documented first course of therapy (treatment plan) f rom the medical record. First course of therapy ends when the treatment plan is completed no matter how long it takes to complete the plan unless there is documentation of disease progression, recurrence, or treatment failure (see #2 below) . Example: Hormonal therapy (e.g., Tamoxifen) after surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy. First course ends when hormonal therapy is completed, even if this takes years, unless there is documentation of disease progression, recurrence, or treatment failure ( see #2 below). 2. First course of therapy ends when there is documentation of disease progression, recurrence, or treatment failure Example 1: The documented treatment plan for sarcoma is pre- operative (neoadjuvant) chemotherapy, followed by surgery, then radiation or chemotherapy depending upon the pathology from surgery. Scans show the tumor is not regressing after pre -operative chemotherapy. Plans for surgery are cancelled, radiation was not administered, and a different type of chemotherapy is started. Code only the first chemotherapy as first course. Do not code the second chemotherapy as first course because it is administered after documented treatment failure. Example 2: The documented treatment plan for a patient with locally advanced breast cancer includes mastectomy, chemotherapy, radiation to the chest wall and axilla, and hormone therapy. The patient has the mastectomy and completes chemotherapy. During the course of radiation therapy, the liver enzymes are rising. Workup proves liver metastases. Th e physician stops the radiation and does not continue with hormone therapy (the treatment plan is altered). The patient is placed on a clinical trial to receive Herceptin for metastatic breast cancer. Code SEER Program Coding and Staging Manual 2021 Section VII: First Course of Therapy 153 the mastectomy, chemotherapy, and radiation as fir st course of treatment. Do not code the Herceptin as first course of therapy because it is administered after documented disease progression. 3. When there is no documentation of a treatment plan or progression, recurrence or a treatment failure, first course of therapy ends one year after the date of diagnosis. Any treatment given after one year is second course of therapy in the absence of a documented treatment plan or a standard of treatment . Coding Instructions 1. Code all treatment data item s to 0 or 00 (N ot done) when the physician opts for active surveillance, deferred therapy, expectant management, or watchful waiting . When the disease progresses or the patient becomes symptomatic, any prescribed treatment is second course. a. Code Treatment Status (RX Summ --Treatment Status) to 2 2. Code the treatment as first course of therapy if the patient refuses treatment but changes his/her mind and the prescribed treatment is implemented less than one year from the date of diagnosis, AND there is no evidence of disease progression 3. The first course of therapy is no treatmen t when the patient refuses all treatment. Code all treatment data item s to Refused. a. Keep the refused codes even if the patient later changes his/her mind and decides to have the prescribed treatment i. more than one year after diagnosis , or ii. when there is evidence of disease progression before treatment is implemented 4. Code all treatment that was started and administered, whether completed or not . Document treatment discontinu ation in text fields . Example: The patient completed only the first dose of a planned 30- day chemotherapy regimen. Code chemotherapy as administered. 5. Code the treatment on each abstract when a patient has multiple primaries and the treatment given for one primary also affects/treats another primary Example 1: The patient had prostate and bladder cancer. The bladder cancer was treated with a TURB. The prostate cancer was treated with radiation to the prostate and pelvis. The pelvic radiation includes the regional lymph nodes for the bladder. Code the radiation as treatment for both the bladder and prostate cases. Example 2: The patient had a hysterectomy for ovarian cancer. The pathology report reveals a previously unsuspected microinvasive cancer of the cervix. Code the hysterectomy as surgical treatment for both the ovarian and cervix primaries. 6. Code the treatments only for the site that is affected when a patient has multiple primaries and the treatment affects only one of the primaries Example: The patient has colon and tonsil primaries. The colon cancer is treated with a hemicolectomy and the tonsil primary is treated with radiation to the tonsil and regional nodes. Do not code the radiation for the colon. Do not code the hemicolectomy for the tonsil. SEER Program Coding and Staging Manual 2021 Section VII: First Course of Therapy 154 7. Code the treatment given as first course even if the correct primary is identified later when a patient is diagnosed with an unknown primary Example: The patient is diagnosed with metastatic carcinoma, unknown primary site. After a full course of chemotherapy, the primary site is identified as prostate. Code the chemotherapy as first course of treatment. a. Do not code treatment as first course when it is added to the plan after the primary site is discovered. This is a change in the treatment plan. Example: The patient is diagnosed with metastatic carcinoma, unknown primary site. After a full course of chemotherapy, the primary site is identified as prostate. Hormonal treatment is started. Code the chemotherapy as first course of treatment. The hormone therapy is second course because it was not part of the initial treatment plan. 8.

Site- specific surgery codes are included under Appendix C of this manual. General Coding Structure (See Appe ndix C for site -specific codes .) Code Description 00 None; no surgical procedure of primary site; diagnosed at autopsy only 10-19 Site-specific codes. Tumor destruction; no pathologic specimen or unknown whether there is a pathologic specimen 20-80 Site-specific codes. Resection; pathologic specimen 90 Surgery, NOS. A surgical procedure to the primary site was done, but no information on the type of surgical procedure i s provided. 98 Special codes for hematopoietic neoplasms ; ill-defined sites; and unknown primaries (See site - specific codes for the sites and histologies), except death certificate only 99 Unknown if surgery performed Use the entire operative report as the primary source document to determine the best surgery of primary site code. The body of the operative report will designate the surgeon's planned procedure as well as a description of the procedure that was actually performed. The pathology report may be used to complement the information appearing in the operative report, but the operative report takes precedence. Coding Instructions 1. Code 00 when a. No surgery was performed on the primary site, OR b. First course of treatment was active surveillance/watchful waiting, OR c. Case was diagnosed at autopsy Note: Code 00 e xcludes all sites and histologies that would be coded as 98 . (See Coding Instruction 10 below .) 2. Use the site- specific coding scheme correspo nding to the primary site or histology 3. Code the most invasive, extensive, or definitive surgery if the patient has multiple surgical procedures of the primary site even if there is no residual tumor found in the pathologic specimen from the more extensive surgery Example: Patient has a needle biopsy of prostate that is positive for adenocarcinoma. The patient chooses to have a radical prostatectomy. The pathologic examination of the prostatectomy specimen shows no residual tumor. Code the radical prostatect omy. 4. Code an excisional biopsy , even when documented as incisional , when a. All disease is removed ( margins free), OR SEER Program Coding and Staging Manual 2021 Section VII: First Course of Therapy 165 b. All gross disease is removed and there is only microscopic residual at the margin Note 1: Do not code an incisional biopsy as an excisional biopsy when there is macroscopic residual disease. Note 2 : Shave or punch biopsies are most often diagnostic. Code as a surgical procedure only when the entire tumor is removed and margins meet the criteria in either 4 .a or 4 .b above. Example: Shave biopsy performed for a suspicious lesion on the skin of the right arm that has been changing in size and color. The shave biopsy pathology report showed malignant melanoma with only microscopically positive margins. Code the shave biopsy as an excisional biopsy. 5. Code total removal of the primary site when a previous procedure resected a portion of the site and the current surgery removed the rest of the organ. The previous procedure may have been cancer directed or non -cancer directed surgery. Example: Left thyroidectomy for suspicious nodules. papillary carcinoma. Completion thyroidectomy was pe rformed . Code surgery of primary site as total thyroidectomy (50). 6. Code the removal of regional or distant tissue/organs when they are resected in continuity with the primary site ( en bloc ) and that regional organ/tissue is listed in the Surgery of Primary Site codes. Specimens from an en bloc resection may be submitted t o pathology separately. Example: Code an en bloc removal when the patient has a hysterectomy and an omentectomy. 7. Code surgery for extra -lymphatic lymphoma using the site -specific surgery coding scheme for the primary site. Do not use the lymph node scheme. 8. Assign the surgery code(s) that best represents the extent of the surgical procedure that was actually carried out when surgery is aborted. If the procedure was aborted before anyt hing took place, assign code 00. See 1.a. above. 9. Code 80 or 90 only when there is no specific information 10. Code 98 for the following primary sites unless the case is death certificate only (see #12 below) a. Any case coded to C420, C421, C423, C424, C760- C768, or C809 11. When Surgery of Primary Site is coded 98 a. Code Surgical Marg ins of the Primary Site (#1320) to 9 b. Code Reason for No Surgery of Primary Site (#1340) to 1 12. Code 99 for death certificate only (DCO) cases or if patient record does not state whether a surgical procedure of the primary site was performed (i.e., is unknown) SEER Program Coding and Staging Manual 2021 Section VII: First Course of Therapy 166 Surgical Margins of the Primary Site Item Length: Surgical Margins of the Primary Site describes the final status of the surgical margins after re section of the primary tumor. This item serves as a quality measure for pathology reports, is used for staging, and may be a prognostic factor in recurrence. It applies to all cases that have a surgical procedure of the primary site. Code Description 0 No residual tumor 1 Residual tumor, NOS 2 Microscopic residual tumor 3 Macroscopic residual tumor 7 Margins not evaluable 8 No primary site surgery 9 Unknown or not applicable Note: Codes were site- specific from 1998 to 2002, and have been changed to be generic across all disease sites. Coding Instructions 1. Assign code 0 when all margins are negative both microscopically and macroscopically (grossly) 2. Codes 0- 3 are hierarchical a. Assig n the numerically higher code if two codes describe the margin status 3. Assign code 1 for involvement of margins but not otherwise specified 4. Assign code 2 for involvement of margins microscopically but not grossly (cannot be seen by the naked eye) . Use the M argins section of the CAP protocol or the M icroscopic Description from the pathology report to identify microscopic findings. 5. Assign code 3 for involvement of margins grossly (seen by the naked eye) . Use the Margins section of the CAP protocol or the G ross Description from the pathology report to identify macroscopic findings. 6. Assign code 7 if the pathology report indicates the margins could not be determined 7. Assign code 9 a. When Surgery of Primary Site (#1290) is coded to 98 (not applicable) b. When it is unknown whether a surgical procedure of the primary site was performed or there is no mention in the pathology report or no tissue was sent to pathology c. For a ny case coded to primary For dea th certificate only (DCO) cases SEER Program Coding and Staging Manual 2021 Section VII: First Course of Therapy 167 Scope of Regional Lymph Node Surgery Item Length: rxSummScopeRegLnSur Scope of Regional Lymph Node Surgery describes the procedure of removal, biopsy, or aspiration of regional lymph nodes performed during the initial work- up or first course of therapy. Instructions for coding sentinel ly mph node biopsies (SLNBx) have been clarified for 2012 and later , diagnoses. Additional instructions for breast primaries (C500 -C509) are described below, following the general coding instructions. Code Description 0 No regional lymph nodes removed or aspirated; diagnosed at autopsy. 1 Biopsy or aspiration of regional lymph node, NOS 2 Sentinel lymph node biopsy [only] 3 Number of regional lymph nodes removed unknown, not stated; regional lymph nodes removed, NOS 4 1 to 3 regional lymph nodes removed 5 4 or more regional lymph nodes removed 6 Sentinel node biopsy and code 3, 4, or 5 at same time or timing not noted 7 Sentinel node biopsy and code 3, 4, or 5 at different times 9 Unknown or not applicable Coding Instructions 1. Use the entire operative report as the primary source document to determine whether the operative procedure was a SLNBx, or a more extensive dissection of regional lymph nodes, or a combination of both SLNBx and regional lymph node dissection. The body of the operative report will designate the surgeon's planned procedure as well as a description of the procedure that was actually performed. The pathology report may be used to complement the information appearing in the operative report, but the operative report takes precedence when attempting to distinguish between SLNBx and regional lymph node dissection or a combination of these two procedures. Do not use the number of lymph nodes removed and pathologically examined as the sole means of distinguishing be tween a SLNBx and a regional lymph node dissection. 2. Code r egiona l lymph node procedures in this data item. Record distant lymph node removal in Surgical Procedure of Other Site. a. Include lymph nodes that are regional in the current AJCC Staging Manual or EOD 2018 3. Record all surgical procedures that remove, biopsy, or aspirate regional lymph node(s) whether or not there were any surgical procedures of the primary site. The regional lymph node surgical procedure(s) may be done to diagnose cancer, stage the disease, or as a part of the initial treatment . Example: Patient has a sentinel node biopsy of a single lymph node. Assign code 2 (Sentinel lymph node biopsy [only]). SEER Program Coding and Staging Manual 2021 Section VII: First Course of Therapy 168 4. Include lymph nodes obtained or biopsied during any procedure within the first course of treatment. A separate lymph node surgery is not required. a. Code the removal of intra -organ lymph nodes in Scope of Regional Lymph Node Surgery Example: Local excision of breast cancer. Specimen includes an intra- mammary lymph node. Assign code 4 (1 to 3 regional lymph nodes removed). 5. Add the number of all of the lymph nodes removed during each surgical procedure performed as part of the first course of treatment. The Scope of Regional Lymph Node data item is cumulative . Example: Patient has excision of a positive cervical node. The pathology report from a subsequent node dissection identifies three cervical nodes. Assign code 5 (4 or more regional lymph nodes removed). a. Lymph node aspirations i. Do not double -count when a regional lymph node is aspirated and t hat node is in the resection field. Do not add the aspirated node to the total number. ii. Count as an additional node when a regional lymph node is aspirated and that node is NOT in the resection field. Add it to the total number. iii. Assume the lymph node that i s aspirated is part of the lymph node chain surgically removed and do not include it in the count when its location is not known 6. Code the removal of regional nodes for both primaries when the patient has two primaries with common regional lymph nodes Example: Patient has a cystoprostatectomy and pelvic lymph node dissection for bladder cancer. Pathology identifies prostate cancer as well as the bladder cancer and 4/21 nodes positive for metastatic adenocarcinoma. Code Scope of Regional Lymph Node Surgery to 5 (4 or more regional lymph nodes removed) for both primaries. 7. Assign the appropriate code for occult head and neck primaries wi th positive cervical lymph nodes (schema 00060). Do not default to code 9 for this schema. 8. Assign code 0 when a. Regional lymph node removal procedure was not performed Note: Excludes all sites and histologies that would be coded 9. (See Coding Instruction #13 below .) OR b. First course of treatment was active surveillance/watchful waiting OR c. The operative report lists a lymph node dissection, but no nodes were found by the pathologist 9. Assign code 2 when a. The operative report states that a SLNBx was performed OR b. The operative report describes a procedure using injection of a dye, radio label, or combination t o identify a lymph node (possibly more than one) for removal/examination Note : When a SLNBx is performed, additional non-sentinel nodes can be taken during the same operative procedure. These additional non- sentinel nodes may be discovered by the pathologi st or selectively removed (or harvested) as part of the SLNBx procedure by the SEER Program Coding and Staging Manual 2021 Section VII: First Course of Therapy 169 surgeon. Code this as a SLNBx (code 2). If review of the operative report confirms that a regional lymph node dissection followed the SLNBx, code these cases as 6 . 10. Codes 3, 4, and 5 : The operative report states that a regional lymph node dissection was performed (a SLNBx was not done during this procedure or in a prior procedure) a. Code 3: Check the operative report to ensure this procedure is not a SLNBx only (code 2), or a SLNBx with a regional lymph node dissection (code 6 or 7) b. Code 4 should be used infrequently. Review the operative report to ensure the procedure was not a SLNBx only. c. Code 5: If a relatively small number of nodes was examined pathologically, review the operativ e report to confirm the procedure was not a SLNBx only (code 2). If a relatively large number of nodes was examined pathologically, review the operative report to confirm that there was not a SLNBx in addition to a more extensive regional lymph node dissection during the same, or separate, procedure (code 6 or 7). Note : Infrequently, a SLNBx is attempted and the patient fails to map (i.e., no sentinel lymph nodes are identified by the dye and/or radio label injection). When mapping fails, surgeons usually perform a more extensive dissection of regional lymph nodes. Code these cases as 2 if no further dissection of regional lymph nodes was undertaken, or 6 when regional lymph nodes were dissected duri ng the same operative event. 11. Code 6: SLNBx and regional lymph node dissection (code 3, 4, or 5) during the same surgical event, or timing not known a. Generally, SLNBx followed by a regional lymph node completion will yield a relatively large number of nodes. However , it is possible for these procedures to harvest only a few nodes. b. If relatively few nodes are pathologically examined, review the operative report to confi rm whether the procedure was limited to a SLNBx only c. Infrequently, a SLNBx is attempted and the patient fails to map (i.e., no sentinel lymph nodes are identified by the dye and/or radio label injection) . When mapping fails, the surgeon usually performs a more extensive dissection of regional lymph nodes. Code these cases as 6 . 12. Code 7: SLNBx and regional lymph node dissection (code 3, 4, or 5) in separate surgical events a. Generally, SLNBx followed by regional lymph node completion will yield a relatively large number of nodes. However, it is possible for these procedures to harvest only a few nodes. b. If relatively few nodes are pathologically examined, review the operative report to confirm whether the procedure was limited to a SLNBx only 13. Code 9: The status o f regional lymph node evaluation should be known for surgically treated cases (i.e., cases coded 19 -90 in the data item Surgery of Primary Site [NAACCR Item #1290]). Review surgically treated cases coded as 9 in Scope of Regional Lymph Node Surgery to confirm the code. a. Assign code 9 for i.

Use the entire operative report as the primary source document to determine whether the operative procedure was a SLNBx, an axillary node dissection (ALND), or a combination of both SLNBx and ALND. The body of the operative report will designate the surgeon's planned procedure as well as a description of the procedure that was actually performed. The pathology report may be used to complement the information appearing in the operative report, but the operative report takes precedence when attempting to distinguish between SLNBx and ALND, or a combination of these two procedures. Do not use the number of lymph nodes re moved and pathologically examined as the sole means of distinguishing between a SLNBx and an ALND. 2. Code 1 a. Excisional biopsy or aspiration of regional lymph nodes for breast cancer is uncommon. Review the operative report to confirm whether an excisional biopsy or aspiration of regional lymph nodes was actually performed; it is highly possible that the procedure is a SLNBx (code 2) instead. If additional procedures were performed on the lymph nodes, such as axillary lymph node dissection, use the appropriate code 2- 7. 3. Code 2 a. If a relatively large number of lymph nodes, more than 5, are pathologically examined, review the operative report to confirm the procedure was limited to a SLNBx and did not include an axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) b. Infrequently, a SLNBx is attempted and the patient fails to map (i.e., no sentinel lymph nodes are identified by the dye and/or radio label injection) and no sentinel nodes are removed. Review the operative report to confirm that an axillary incision was made and a node exploration was conducted. Patients undergoing SLNBx who fail to map will often undergo ALND. Use code 2 if no ALND was performed, or 6 when ALND was performed during the same operative event. Enter the appropriate number of nodes examined and positive in the data items Regional Lymph Nodes Examined (NAACCR Item #830) and Regional Lymph Nodes Positive (NAACCR Item #820). 4. Codes 3, 4, and 5: Generally, ALND removes at least 7 -9 nodes. However, it is possible for these procedures to remove or harvest fewer nodes. Review the operative report to confirm that there was not a SLNBx in addition to a more extensive regional lymph node dissection during the same procedure (code 6 or 7). 5. Code 6 a. Generally, SLNBx followed by ALND will yield a minimum of 7 -9 nodes. However , it is possible for these procedures to harvest fewer (or more) nodes. b. If relatively few nodes are pathologically examined, review the operative report to confirm whether the proc edure was limited to a SLNBx, or whether a SLNBx plus an ALND was performed 6. Code 7 a. Generally, SLNBx followed by ALND will yield a minimum of 7 -9 nodes. However, it is possible for these procedures to harvest fewer (or more) nodes. b. If relatively few nodes are pathologically examined, review the operative report to confirm whether the procedure was limited to a SLNBx only, or whether a SLNBx plus an ALND was performed SEER Program Coding and Staging Manual 2021 Section VII: First Course of Therapy 171 Date of Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy Item Length: 8 NAACCR Item #: 83 2 NAACCR Lymph Node Biopsy XML ID: dateSentinelLymphNodeBiopsy Date of Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy , effective 01/01/ 2018, records the date of the sentinel lymph node biopsy procedure.

Do not count a posit ive aspiration or core biopsy of a lymph node in the same lymph node chain removed at surgery as an additional node in Regional Nodes Positive when there are positive nodes in the resection. In other words, when there are positive regional lymph nodes in a lymph node dissection, do not count the core needle biopsy or the fine needle aspiration if it is in the same chain. See also Use of Code 95 below. Example 1: Lung cancer patient has a mediastinoscopy and positive core biopsy of a hilar lymph node. Patient then undergoes right upper lobectomy that yields 3 hilar and 2 mediastinal nodes positive out of 11 nodes dissected. Code Regional Nodes Positive as 05 and Regional Nodes Examined as 11 because the core biopsy was of a lymph node in the same chain as the nodes dissected. SEER Program Coding and Staging Manual 2021 Section VII: First Course of Therapy 179 Example 2: Positive right cervical lymph node aspiration followed by right cervical lymph node dissection showing 1 of 6 nodes positive. Code Regional Nodes Positive as 01 and Regional Nodes Examined as 06. c. Include the node in the c ount of Regional Nodes Positive when the positive aspiration or core biopsy is from a node in a different node region Example : Breast cancer patient has a positive core biopsy of a supraclavicular node and an axillary dissection showing 3 of 8 nodes posit ive. Code Regional Nodes Positive as 04 and Regional Nodes Examined as 09 because the supraclavicular lymph node is in a different, but still regional, lymph node chain. d. Assume the lymph node that is core -biopsied or aspirated is part of the lymph node cha in surgically removed and do not include it in the count of Regional Nodes Positive when its location is not known Example : Patient record states that lymph node core biopsy was performed at another facility and 7/14 regional lymph nodes were positive at t he time of resection. Code Regional Nodes Positive as 07 and Regional Nodes Examined as 14. 5. Priority of lymph node counts. Use information in the following priority when there is a discrepancy regarding the number of positive lymph nodes a. Final diagnosis b. Synoptic report (also known as CAP protocol or pathology report checklist ; the consolidated findings on the CAP protocol ) c. Microscopic description d. Gross description 6. Positive nodes in multiple primaries in same organ a. Determine the histology of the metastases in the nodes and code the nodes as positive for the primary with that histology when there are multiple primary cancers with different histologic types in the same organ and the pathology report just states the num ber of nodes positive b. Code the nodes as positive for all primaries when no further information is available Example: A breast case is two separate primaries as determined by the SEER multiple primary rules. The pathology report states \"3 of 11 lymph nodes positive for metastasis\" with no further information available. Code Regional Nodes Positive as 03 and Regional Nodes Examined as 11 for both primaries. 7. Isolated Tumor Cells (ITCs) in lymph nodes a. For all cases except cutaneous melanoma and Merkel cell carcinoma of skin i. Count only lymph nodes that contain micrometastases or larger (metastases greater than 0.2 millimeters in size) ii. Assume the metastases are larger than 0.2 mm and count the lymph node(s) as positive when the path report indicates that node s are positive but the size of metastasis is not stated iii. Do not include in the count of lymph nodes positive any nodes that are identified as containing ITCs b. For cutaneous melanoma and Merkel cell carcinoma of skin i. Count nodes with ITCs as positive lymph n odes SEER Program Coding and Staging Manual 2021 Section VII: First Course of Therapy 180 8. Use code 95 when a. The only procedure for regional lymph nodes is a needle aspiration (cytology) or core biopsy (tissue) b. A positive lymph node is aspirated and there are no surgically resected lymph nodes Example : Patient with esophageal cancer. Enlar ged mid- esophageal node found on CT scan, which is aspirated and found to be positive. Patient undergoes radiation therapy and no surgery. Code Regional Nodes Positive as 95 and Regional Nodes Examined as 95. c. A positive lymph node is aspirated and surgical ly resected lymph nodes are negative Example : Lung cancer patient has aspiration of suspicious hilar mass that shows metastatic squamous carcinoma in lymph node tissue. Patient undergoes neoadjuvant (preoperative) radiation therapy followed by lobectomy showing 6 negative hilar lymph nodes. Code Regional Nodes Positive as 95 and Regional Nodes Examined as the 06 nodes surgically resected. 9. Code 97. Use code 97 for any combination of positive aspirated, biopsied, sampled, or dissected lymph nodes when the number of involved nodes cannot be determined on the basis of cytology or histology. Code 97 includes positive lymph nodes diagnosed by either cytology or histology. Example : Patient with carcinoma of the pyriform sinus has a mass in the mid neck. Fine needle aspiration (FNA) of one node is positive. The patient has neoadjuvant (preoperative) chemotherapy, then resection of the primary tumor and a radical neck dissection. In the radical neck dissection , \"several\" of 10 nodes are positive; the remainder of the nodes show chemotherapy effect. Code Regional Nodes Positive as 97 because the total number of positive nodes biopsied and removed is unknown, and code Regional Nodes Examined as 10. Note : If the aspirated node is the only one that is microscopically positive, use code 95. 10. Use code 98 when a. The assessment of lymph nodes is clinical only b. No lymph nodes are removed and examined c. A \"dissection\" of a lymph node drainage area is found to contain no lymph nodes at the time of pathologic examination d.

Primary site is C420, C421, C423, C424, C760- C768, or C809 Note : Surgery is not standard treatment for these cases. ii. There is no information in the patient's medical record about surgery, AND It is known that surgery is not usually performed for this type and/or stage of cancer OR There is no reason to suspect that the patient would ha ve had surgery of primary site Example : The patient would not be a surgical candidate because of advanced stage. SEER Program Coding and Staging Manual 2021 Section VII: First Course of Therapy 187 iii. The treatment plan offered multiple treatment options and the patient selected treatment that did not include surgery of the primary site Example: Prostate cancer patient is offered three treatment options: a. Radical prostatectomy, b. Radiation therapy, or c. Hormone therapy. The patient chose to have radiation therapy. Assign code 1. Surgery of the primary site was not performed because it was not part of the planned first course of treatment. The treatment plan was for the patient to receive ONE of three treatment modality options: surgery, OR radiation, OR hormone therapy. At no time did the physician recommend that the patient have surgery AND radiation therapy AND hormone therapy. The patient chose radiation. This does not mean he refused surgery because at no time did the treatment plan include both radiation AND surgery. Recording that a patient refused the treatment modality means that the patient refused recommended therapy. This is a quality control check explaining why the patient did not receive the expected treatment for their cancer (patient's choice versus physician's choic e, or facility's lack of providing quality care). iv. Surgery was part of the first course of treatment but was cancelled due to complete response to radiation and/or systemic therapy v. Patient elected to pursue no treatment following the discussion of surgery. Discussion does not equal a recommendation. Patient's decision not to pursue surgery is not a refusal of surgery in this situation. vi. Active surveillance/watchful waiting is the first course (e.g., prostate) b. Assign code 6 when i. It is KNOWN that surgery was recommended AND ii. It is KNOWN that surgery was not performed AND iii. There is no documentation explaining why surgery was not done Example: The medical record has a recommendation that the patient have surgery. No further admissions or documentation of surgery f ound; the primary care physician replies that the patient did NOT have surgery. No further information is given; it is unknown if the patient refused surgery or if there were co -morbid conditions that prevented the surgical procedure. c. Assign code 7 when the patient i. Refuses recommended surgery OR ii. Makes a blanket statement that he/she refused all treatment when surgery is a customary option according to NCCN guidelines and/or the NCI PDQ for the primary site/histology Assign code 1 when surgery is not normally performed for the site/histology Note: Coding Reason for No Surgery of Primary Site as \"refused\" does not affect the coding of the other treatment data item s (e.g., Radiation, Chemotherapy, Hormone Therapy, etc.). Code 7 means surgery is exactly w hat was recommended by the physician and the patient refused. If two treatment alternatives were offered and surgery was not chosen, code Reason no surgery of primary site as 1 [Surgery of the primary site was not performed because it was not part of the planned first -course treatment]. SEER Program Coding and Staging Manual 2021 Section VII: First Course of Therapy 188 d. Assign code 8 when surgery is recommended, but it is unknown if the patient actually had the surgery Example: There is documentation in the medical record that the primary care physician referred the patient to a surgical on cologist. Follow -back to the surgical oncologist and primary care physician yields no further information. Assign code 8, it is known that surgery was recommended but there is no information on whether or not the patient actually had the surgical procedure . Note : Review cases coded 8 periodically for later confirmation of surgery. 4. Assign code 9 a. When there is no documentation that surgery was recommended or performed b. For death certificate only (DCO) cases c. Autopsy only cases SEER Program Coding and Staging Manual 2021 Section VII: First Course of Therapy 189 Date Radiation Started Item Length: 8 NAACCR Item ID: rxDateRadiation Date Radiation Started is the date when radiation therapy began as part of the first course of therapy. The d ate radiation started will typically be found in the radiation oncologist's summary letter for the first course of treatment. Determination of the date radiation started may require assistance from the radiation oncologist for consistent coding. Date Radiation Started must be transmitted in the YYYYMMDD format. Date Radiation Started may be recorded in the transmission format, or recorded in the traditional format (MMDDYYYY) and converted electronically to the transmission format. SEER Central Registries: Collect when available from CoC reportin g facilities. Coding Instructions 1. Record the date of the first/earliest radiation treatment if radiation was given and recorded as part of the first course of therapy a. Do not record the date of the initial radiation planning session 2. Radiation date should be the same as the Date Therapy Initiated when radiation is the only treatment administered 3. There may be times when the first course of treatment information is incomplete. Therefore, it is important to continue follow -up efforts to be certain the complete treatment information is collected. 4.

SEER Central Registries: Collec t when available from CoC reporting facilities. Code Label Description 00 No radiation treatment Radiation therapy was not administered to the patient. Diagnosed at autopsy. 01 External beam, NOS The treatment is known to be by external beam, but there is insufficient information to determine the specific planning technique 02 Low energy x - ray/photon therapy External beam therapy administered using equipment with a maximum energy of less than one (1) million volts (MV). Energies are typically expressed in units of kilovolts (kV). These type of treatments are sometimes referred to as electronic brachytherapy or orthovoltage or superficial therapy. Clinical notes may refer to the brand names of low energy x- ray delivery devices, e.g., A xxent \u00ae, INTRABEAM\u00ae, or Esteya\u00ae. 03 2-D therapy An external beam planning technique using 2 -D imaging, such as plain film x -rays or fluoroscopic images, to define the location and size of the treatment beams. Should be clearly described as 2 -D therapy. This planning modality is typically used only for palliative treatments. 04 Conformal or 3 -D conformal therapy An external beam planning technique using multiple, fixed beams shaped to conform to a defined target volume. Should be clearly described as confor mal or 3 -D therapy in patient record. 05 Intensity modulated therapy An external beam planning technique where the shape or energy of beams is optimized using software algorithms. Any external beam modality can be modulated but these generally refer to photon or proton beams. Intensity modulated therapy can be described as intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT), intensity modulated x- ray or proton therapy (IMXT/IMPT), volumetric arc therapy (VMAT) and other ways. If a treatment is described as IMRT w ith online re - optimization/re -planning, then it should be categorized as online re - optimization or re -planning. SEER Program Coding and Staging Manual 2021 Section VII: First Course of Therapy 193 Code Label Description 06 Stereotactic radiotherapy or radiosurgery, NOS Treatment planning using stereotactic radiotherapy/radiosurgery techniques, but the treatment is not described as CyberKnife\u00ae or Gamma Knife\u00ae. These approaches are sometimes described as SBRT (stereotactic body SRT the treatment is described as robotic radiotherapy (e.g., CyberKnife\u00ae) or Gamma Knife \u00ae, use stereotactic radiotherapy subcodes below. If a treatment is described as stereotactic radiotherapy or radiosurgery with online re -optimization/re -planning, then it should be cat egorized as online re -optimization or re -planning . 07 radiotherapy or radiosurgery, robotic Treatment planning using stereotactic radiotherapy/radiosurgery techniques which is specifically described as robotic (e.g., CyberKnife\u00ae) 08 Stereotactic radiotherapy or radiosurgery, Gamma Knife\u00ae Treatment planning using stereotactic radiotherapy/radiosu rgery techniques which uses a Cobalt -60 gamma ray source and is specifically described as Gamma Knife\u00ae. This is most commonly used for treatments in the brain. 09 CT-guided online adaptive therapy An external beam technique in which the treatment plan is adapted over the course of radiation to reflect changes in the patient's tumor or normal anatomy radiation using a CT scan obtained at the treatment machine (online). These approaches are sometimes described as CT - guided online re -optimization or online re -planning. If a treatment technique is described as both CT -guided online adaptive therapy as well as another external beam technique (IMRT, SBRT, etc.), then it should be categorized as CT -guided online adaptive therapy. If a treatment is described as \"ad aptive\" but does not include the descriptor \"online,\" this code should not be used. 10 MR-guided online adaptive therapy An external beam technique in which the treatment plan is adapted over the course of radiation to reflect changes in the patient's tum or or normal anatomy radiation using an MRI scan obtained at the treatment machine (online). These approaches are sometimes described as MR - guided online re -optimization or online re -planning. If a treatment technique is described as both MR -guided online adaptive therapy as well as another external beam technique (IMRT, SBRT, etc.), then it should be categorized as MR -guided online adaptive therapy. If a treatment is described as \"adaptive\" but does not include the descriptor \"online,\" this code should not be used. 88 Not Applicable Treatment not by external beam 98 Other, NOS Other radiation, NOS; Radiation therapy administered, but the treatment modality is not specified or is unknown 99 Unknown It is unknown whether radiation therapy was administered Radiation external beam treatment planning technique will typically be found in the radiation oncologist's summary letter for the first course of treatment. Determination of the external beam planning technique may require assistance from t he radiation oncologist to ensure consistent coding. The first phase may be commonly referred to as an initial plan and a subsequent phase may be referred to as a boost or cone down, and would be recorded as Phase I I, Phase III, etc., accordingly A new pha se begins when there is a clinically meaningful change in target volume, treatment fraction size (i.e., dose given during a session), modality, or treatment technique. Any one of these SEER Program Coding and Staging Manual 2021 Section VII: First Course of Therapy 194 changes will generally mean that a new radiation plan will be generated in the treatment planning system and should be coded as a new phase of radiation therapy. Note : \"Online adaptive therapy\" refers to treatment where radiation treatment plans are adapted or updated while a patient is on the treatment table. When treatment plans are adapted, the shape of the target volume may change from day to day but, for registry purposes, the volume that is being targeted will not change. An adapted plan should not be coded as though a new phase of treatment has been initiated unless, as above, the radiation oncologist documents it as a new phase in the radiation treatment summary. Two new technique codes have been added to capture when online adaptive therapy is occurring: CT-guided and MR -guided adaptive therapy. Refer to the current STandards for Oncology Registry Entry (STORE) Manual and the CTR Guide to Coding Radiation Therapy Treatment in the STORE Coding Instructions 1. Assign code 00 when a. The patient did not have radiation b. Diagnosed at autopsy (f or death certificate only (DCO) cases ) 2. Assign code 04 for Conformal or 3 -D Conformal Therapy whenever either is explicitly mentioned 3.

It was recommended by the patient's physician but was not administered as part of the first course of therapy. No reason was stated in patient record. 87 Chemotherapy was not administered. It was recommended by the patient's physician, but t he treatment was refused by the patient, a patient's family member, or the patient's guardian. The refusal was noted in the patient record. 88 Chemotherapy was recommended, but it is unknown if it was administered 99 It is unknown whether a chemotherapeutic agent(s) was recommended or administered because it is not stated in the patient record Important update effective for diagnosis date January 1, 2013 forward A comprehensive review of chemotherapeutic drugs currently found in the SEER*R x - Interactive Drug Database was performed and in keeping with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the six (6) drugs listed in the table below have changed categories from Chemotherapy to BRM/Immunotherapy. This change is effective for cases dia gnosed January 1, 2013 forward. For c ases diagnosed prior to January 1, 2013, code these six (6) drugs as chemotherapy. Coding instructions related to this change have been added to the R emarks section for the applicable drugs in SEER*Rx. Drug Name /Brand Name Previous Category New Category Effective Date See Note and Staging Manual 2021 Section VII: First Course of Therapy 203 Note : Use the date of diagnosis , not the date of treatment, to determine whether to code these drugs as chemotherapy or BRM/Immunotherapy. Example 1: Patient diagnosed with HER2 positive breast cancer December 15, 20 20 and was placed on planned Herceptin February 2, 2021. Code Herceptin in the BRM/Immunotherapy data item (as the patient was diagnosed after January 1, 2013) . Example 2: Patient diagnosed with breast cancer November 1, 2012, and begins receiving Rituximab January 30, 2013, as part of first course therapy. Code the Rituximab in the chemotherapy data item because the patient was diagnosed prior to January 1, 2013. Definitions Chemotherapy recommended: A consult recommended chemotherapy, or the attending physician documented that chemotherapy was recommended. A referral to a clinical oncologist is equivalent to a recommendation. Multiple agent chemotherapy: Planned first course of therapy included two or more chemotherapeutic agents and those agents were administered. The planned first course of therapy may or may not have included other agents such as hormone therapy, immunotherapy, or other treatment in addition to the chemotherapeutic agents. Single agent chemotherapy: Only one chemotherapeutic agent was administered to destroy cancer tissue during the first course of therapy. The chemotherapeutic agent m ay or may not have been administered with other drugs classified as immunotherapy, hormone therapy, ancillary, or other treatment. Coding Instructions 1. Code the chemotherapeutic agents whose actions are chemotherapeutic only; do not code the method of administration 2. When chemotherapeutic agents are used as radiosensitizers or radioprotectants, they are given at a much lower dosage and do not affect the cancer. Radiosensitizers and radioprotectants are classified as ancillary drugs. See SEER*Rx. Do not c ode as chemotherapy . Review the radiation -oncology progress notes for information about radiosensitizing chemotherapy. Note : Do not assume that a chemo agent given with radiation therapy is a radiosensitizer. Seek additional information. Compare the dose given to the dose normally given for treatment. For additional information, see The National Cancer Institute Physician Data Query (PDQ) , Health Professional Version AND/OR The National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology 3. The physician may change a drug during the first course of therapy because the patient cannot tolerate the original agent a. This is a continuation of the first course of therapy when the chemotherapeutic agent that is substituted belongs to the same group (alkylating, antimetabolites, natural products, targeted therapy, or other miscellaneous) SEER Program Coding and Staging Manual 2021 Section VII: First Course of Therapy 204 b. Do not code the new agent as first course therapy when the original chemotherapeutic agent is changed to one that is NOT in the same group. Code only the original agent as first course. When the new agent is in a different group, it is second course thera py. c. Use SEER*Rx and compare the subcategory of each chemotherapy agent to determine whether or not they belong to the same group (subcategory). See \"Chemotherapeutic Agents\" below for the groups and their definitions. 4. Code as treatment for both primaries when the patient receives chemotherapy for invasive carcinoma in one breast and also has an invasive or in situ carcinoma in the other breast. Chemotherapy would likely affect both primaries. Example : Patient is diagnosed with infiltrating duct carcinoma, stage III, in the right breast and infiltrating duct carcinoma, stage I, in the left breast. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy is administered for the stage III neoplasm in the right breast per the breast sur geon consult , but not for the left breast. Code the chemotherapy on both abstracts for both primaries in this case (simultaneous bilateral breast primaries). 5. Assign code 00 when a. The medical record documents chemotherapy was not given, was not recommended, or was not indicated b. There is no information in the patient's medical record about chemotherapy, AND i. It is known that chemotherapy is not usually performed for this type and/or stage of cancer OR ii. There is no reason to suspect that the patient would have had chemotherapy c. The treatment plan offered multiple treatment options and the patient selected treatment that did not include chemotherapy d. Patient elects to pursue no treatment following the discussion of chemotherapy. Discussion does not equal a recommendation. Patient's decision not to pursue chemotherapy is not a refusal of chemotherapy in this situation. e. Active surveillance/watchful waiting is the first course of treatment (e.g., CLL) f. Patient diagnosed at autopsy Example: Patient is diagnosed with plasma cell myeloma. There is no mention of treatment or treatment plans in the medical record. Follow -back finds that the patient died three months after diagnosis. There are no additional medical records or other pertinent information available. Assign code 00 since there is no reason to suspect that the patient had been treated. 6. Do not code combination of ancillary drugs administered with single agent chemotherapeutic agents as multiple chemotherapy. For example, the administration of 5-FU (antimetabolite) and Leucovorin (ancillary drug) is coded to single agent (Code 02). 7. Assign code 82 when chemotherapy is a customary option for the primary site/histology but it was not administered due to patient risk factors, such as a. Advanced age b. Comorbid condition(s) (heart disease, kidney failure, other cancer, etc.) 8. Assign code 87 when a. The patient refused recommended chemotherapy b. The patient made a blanket refusal of all recommended treatment and chemotherapy is a customary option for the primary site/histology SEER Program Coding and Staging Manual 2021 Section VII: First Course of Therapy 205 c.

Assign code 99 when there is no documentation that chemotherapy was recommended or administered a. For death certificate only (DCO) cases Chemotherapeutic Agents Chem otherapeutic agents are chemicals that affect cancer tissue by means other than hormonal manipulation. Chemotherapeutic agents can be divided into five groups . Alkylating agents Antimetabolites Natural products Targeted therapy Miscellaneous Alkylating Agents Alkylating agents are not cell -cycle- specific. Although they are toxic to all cells, they are most active in the resting phase of the cell. Alkylating agents directly damage DNA to prevent the cancer cell from reproducing. Alkylating agents are used to treat many different cancers including acute and chronic leukemia, lymphoma, Hodgkin disease, multiple myeloma, sarcoma, and cancers of the lung, breast, and ovary. Because the drugs damage DNA they can cause long -term damage to the bone mar row and can, in rare cases, lead to acute leukemia. The risk of leukemia from alkylating agents is \"dose -dependent.\" Examples of alkylating because they can cross the blood- brain barrier and can be used in treating brain tumors Metal salts: c arboplatin, cisplatin, and oxaliplatin Antimetabolites Antimetabolites are cell -cycle specific. Antimetabolites are very similar to normal substances within the cell. When the cells incorporate these substances into the cellular metabolism, they are unable to divide. Antimetabolites are classified according to the substances with which they interfere. SEER Program Coding and Staging Manual 2021 Section VII: First Course of Therapy 206 1. Plant Alkaloids are cell -cycle specific which means they attack the cells during various phases of division. They block cell division by preventing microtubule function. Microtubules are vital for cell division. Without them, division cannot occur. Plant alkaloids, as the name implies, are derived from certain types of plants. 2. Antitumor antibiotics are also cell -cycle specific and act during multiple phases of the cell cycle. They are made from natural products and were first produced by the soil fungus Streptomyces. Antitumor antibiotics form free radicals that break DNA strands, stopping the multiplication of cancer cells. interfere with the action of topoisomerase enzymes (topoisomerase I and II). They control the manipulation of the structure of DNA necessary for replication. Topoisomerase I inhibitors: teniposide Targeted Therapy Targeted cancer therapies are drugs or other substances that block the growth and spread of cancer by interfering with specific molecules (\"molecular targets\") that are involved in the growth, progression, and spread of cancer. Targeted cancer therapies are sometimes called \"molecularly targeted drugs,\" \"molecularly targeted therapies,\" \"precision medicines,\" or similar (Gleevec), Coding and Staging Manual 2021 Section VII: First Course of Therapy 207 Coding for Tumor Embolization The American College of Surgeons Commission on Cancer (CoC), the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention National Program of Cancer Registries (NPCR), and the SEER Program have collaborated to clarify and refine coding directives for tumor embolization and are jointly issuing the following instructions. Definitions Chemoembolization: A procedure in which the blood supply to the tumor is blocked surgically or mechanically and anticancer drugs are administered directly into the tumor. This permits a higher concentration of drug to be in contact with the tumor for a longer period of time. Radioembolization: Tumor embolization combined wi th the injection of small radioactive beads or coils into an organ or tumor. Tumor embolization: The intentional blockage of an artery or vein to stop the flow of blood through the desired vessel. Coding Instructions Code as Chemotherapy when the emboli zing agent(s) is a chemotherapeutic drug(s). Use SEER*Rx to determine whether the drugs used are classified as chemotherapeutic agents. Use codes 01, 02, 03 as specific information regarding the agent(s) is documented. Example : The patient has hepatocellular carcinoma (primary liver cancer). From a procedure report: Under x- ray guidance, a small catheter is inserted into an artery in the groin. The catheter's tip is threaded into the artery in the liver that supplies blood flow to the tumor. Chemotherapy is injected through the catheter into the tumor and mixed with particles that embolize or block the flow of blood to the tumor. Do not code pre -surgical (pre -operative) embolization of hypervascular tumors with agents such as particles, coils, or alcohol as a treatment. Pre-surgical embolization is typically performed to prevent excess bleeding during the resection of the primary tumor. Examples where pre -surgical embolization is used include meningiomas, hemangioblastomas, paragangliomas, and renal cell metastases in the brain.

Important update effective for diagnosis date Janu ary 1, 2013 forward A comprehensive review of chemotherapeutic drugs currently found in the SEER*Rx - Interactive Drug Database was performed and in keeping with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the six (6) drugs listed in the table below have changed categories from Chemotherapy to BRM/Immunotherapy. This change is effective for cases diagnosed January 1, 2013 forward. For cases diagnosed prior to January 1, 2013, code these six (6) drugs as chemotherapy. Coding instructions related to this change have been added to the R emarks section for the applicable drugs in SEER*Rx. Drug Name /Brand Name Previous Category New Category Effective Date See Note and Staging Manual 2021 Section VII: First Course of Therapy 216 Note : Use the date of diagnosis , not the date of treatment, to determine whether to code these drugs as chemotherapy or BRM/Immunotherapy. Example: Patient diagnosed with breast cancer January 5, 2021 , and begins receiving Herceptin as part of first course therapy on January 30, 2021. Code the Herceptin in the BRM/Immunotherapy data item. Definitions Immunotherapy is designed to 1. Make cancer cells more recognizable and therefore more susceptible to destruction by the immune system 2. Boost the kil ling power of immune system cells, such as T -cells, NK -cells, and macrophages 3. Alter the growth patterns of cancer cells to promote behavior like that of healthy cells 4. Block or reverse the process that changes a normal cell or a pre- cancerous cell into a cancerous cell 5. Enhance the body's ability to repair or replace normal cells damaged or destroyed by other forms of cancer treatment, such as chemotherapy or radiation 6. Prevent cancer cells from spreading to other parts of the body Types of Immunotherapy Cancer Treatment Vaccines: Also called therapeutic vaccines, are a type of immunotherapy . The vaccines work to boost the body's natural defenses to fight a cancer. Doctors give treatment vaccines to people already diagnosed with cancer. The vaccines may: Prevent cancer from returning Destroy any cancer cells still in the body after other treatment Stop a tumor from growing or spreading Please refer to SEER*Rx to determine how to code non- FDA approved vaccines. Interferons: Interferons belong to a group of proteins called cytokines. They are produced naturally by the white blood cells in the b ody. Interferon -alpha is able to slow tumor growth directly as well as activate the immune system. It is used for a number of cancers including multiple myeloma, chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), hairy cell leukemia, and malignant melanoma. Interleukins (IL-2) are often used to treat kidney cancer and melanoma. Monoclonal Antibodies: Monoclonal antibodies (Mab) are produced in a laboratory. The artificial antibodies are used in a variety of ways in systemic therapy and can be chemotherapy, immunotherapy, or ancillary drugs. Some are injected into the patient to seek out and disrupt cancer cell activities. When the monoclonal antibody disrupts tumor growth, it is coded as chemotherapy. Other Mabs are linked to radioisotopes (conjugated monoclonal antibodi es). The Mab finds and attaches to the target tumor cells and brings with it the radioisotope that actually kills the tumor cell. The monoclonal antibody itself does nothing to enhance the immune system. Conjugated monoclonal antibodies such as tositumomab (Bexxar) or ibritumomab (Zevalin) are coded to the part of the drug that actually kills the cells, usually radioisotopes. A SEER Program Coding and Staging Manual 2021 Section VII: First Course of Therapy 217 third function of Mab is to enhance the immune response against the cancer, either by identifying tumor cells that are mimicking no rmal cells, or by boosting the body's natural defenses that destroy foreign cells. Consult SEER*Rx for the treatment category in which each monoclonal antibody should be coded. Coding Inst ructions 1. Assign code 00 when a.

No reason was noted in the planned or recommended therapy. 87 Transplant procedure and/or endocrine therapy were not administered; this treatment was recommended by the patient's physician but was refuse d by the patient, a patient's family member, or the patient's guardian. The refusal was noted in the patient record. 88 Transplant procedure and/or endocrine therapy was recommended, but it is unknown if it was administered 99 It is unknown if a transpl ant procedure or endocrine therapy was recommended or administered because it is not stated in patient record Definitions Bone marrow transplant (BMT): Procedure where bone marrow is used to restore stem cells that were destroyed by chemotherapy and/or radiation. Replacing the stem cells allows the patient to undergo higher doses of chemotherapy. BMT Allogeneic: Receives bone marrow from a donor. This includes haploidentical (or half -matched) transplants. BMT Autologous: Uses the patient's own bone marrow. The tumor cells are filtered out and the purified blood and stem cells are returned to the patient. BMT Syngeneic: Bone marrow received from an identical twin . SEER Program Coding and Staging Manual 2021 Section VII: First Course of Therapy 219 Conditioning: High -dose chemotherapy with or without radiation administered prior to transplant such as BMT and stem cells to kill cancer cells. This conditioning also destroys normal bone marrow cells so the normal cells need to be replaced (rescue). The high dose chemotherapy is coded in the Chemotherapy data item and the radiation is coded in the Radiation Treatment Modality --Phase I, II, III data item s. Hematopoietic growth factors: A group of substances that support hematopoietic (blood cell) colony formation. The group includes erythropoietin, interleukin -3, and colony- stimulating factors (CSFs). The growth- stimulating substances are ancillary drugs and not coded. Non-myeloablative therapy: Uses immunosuppressive drugs pre - and post -transplant to ablate (destroy) the bone marrow. These are not recorded as therapeutic agents. Peripheral Blood Stem Cell Transplantation (PBSCT): Rescue that uses peripheral blood stem cells to replace stem cells after conditioning. Rescue: Rescue is the actual BMT or PBSCT done after conditioning. Stem cells: Immature cells found in bone marrow, blood stream, placenta, and umbilical cords. The stem cells mature into blood cells. Stem cell transplant: Procedure to replenish supply of healthy blood- forming cells. Also known as bone marrow transplant , PBSCT, or umbilical co rd blood transplant, depending on the source of the stem cells. When stem cells are collected from bone marrow and transplanted into a patient, the procedure is known as a bone marrow transplant . If the transplanted stem cells came from the bloodstream, th e procedure is called a peripheral blood stem cell transplant , sometimes shortened to stem cell transplant. Umbilical cord stem cell transplant: Treatment with stem cells harvested from umbilical cord blood. Coding Instructions 1. Assign code 00 when a.

This data item provides information related to the quality of care and describes whether a patient had neoadjuvant therapy. For the purposes of this data item, neoadjuvant therapy is defined as systemic treatment (chemotherapy, endocrine/ hormone therapy , targeted therapy , immunotherapy, or biological therapy) and/or radiation therapy before intended or performed surgical resection to improve local therapy and long- term outcomes. Code Description 0 No neoadjuvant therapy, no treatment before surgery, surgical resection not part of first course of treatment plan Autopsy only 1 Neoadjuvant therapy completed according to treatment plan and guidelines 2 Neoadjuvant therapy started, but not completed OR unknown if completed 3 Limited systemic exposure when the intent was not neoadjuvant; treatment did not meet the definition of neoadjuvant therapy 9 Unknown if neoadjuvant therapy performed Death c ertificate only (DCO) Definitions There are several related but distinct concepts that cover adjuvant therapy, neoadjuvant therapy, and primary therapy . This section contains definitions that can be used in the context of abstracting and coding. Adjuvant therapy: Additional cancer treatment given after the primary treatment (usually surgery) to lower the risk that the cancer will come back. Adjuvant therapy may include radiation therapy and/or systemic therapy including chemotherapy , endocrine /hormone therapy , Systemic endocrine/ hormone therapy , targeted therapy , immunotherapy, or biological therapy) and/or radiation therapy given prior to surgical resection to improve outcomes . May also be called pre-surgical treatment or preoperative treatment . Neoadjuvant therapy may be administered to Reduce the disease burd en, which might allow surgical resection for previously unresectable disease or allow for less extensive surgical resection, organ preservation or function, or quality of life Eradicate or control undiscovered metastases and improve outcomes of overall sur vival and disease- free survival Provide prognostic information based on response. A clinical response to neoadjuvant therapy is associated with length of disease -free survival and overall survival in some cancer types SEER Program Coding and Staging Manual 2021 Section VII: First Course of Therapy 223 Note : Limited systemic therapy may be given prior to surgery, or may also occur in clinical trials with no expectation of the above -mentioned benefits and should not be coded as neoadjuvant therapy (code 1 or 2) for the purposes of this data item . See instructions for code 3 below. Additional opportunities to use neoadjuvant therapy information Allow direct observation of therapeutic efficacy Allow time for appropriate genetic testing (if applicable) Test novel therapies and predictive biomarkers by providing tumor specimens and blood samples prior to and during systemic treatment Assist in determining the next steps for treatment Compare survival, rates of successful optimal reductive surgical resection , postoperative complications and quali ty of life Limited systemic therapy may be given prior to surgery, or may also occur in clinical trials to study biology of cancer or in other circumstances to impact the biology of a cancer but is not a full course of neoadjuvant therapy with the intent to impact extent of surgical resection or other outcomes (organ preservation, function or quality of life). Do not code as neoadjuvant therapy (code 1 or 2) for the purposes of this data item. See instructions for code 3 below. Primary therapy : The centerpiece of treatment given for a disease. It is often part of a standard set of treatments, such as surgical resection followed by chemotherapy and radiation. It may be used alone to remove or reduce the burden/progression of disease OR used along with additional tr eatments . Surgical resection : For purposes of this data item, surgical resection is defined as the most definitive surgical procedure that removes some or all of the primary tumor or site. For many sites, this would be Surgical Codes 30- 80; however, ther e are some sites where surgical codes less than 30 could be used (for example, code 2 2 for Breast (excisional biopsy or lumpectomy). Coding Guidelines Use this data item to record whether neoadjuvant therapy was administered. This data item captures a fu ll course of neoadjuvant therapy (generally 4 -6 months) or a limited exposure to systemic therapy prior to surgical resection . When part of the treatment plan, a f ull course of neoadjuvant therapy is recommended; however, there are specific scenarios in w hich the planned full course of neoadjuvant therapy is not carried out. Site -specific recommendations for neoadjuvant therapy are found in the NCCN guidelines, ASCO guidelines, or other treatment guidelines. For purposes of this data item, the criteria for neoadjuvant therapy are A physician's treatment plan and /or statement of patient completing neoadjuvant therapy must be used Treatment must follow the recommended treatment guidelines for the type and duration of treatment for that primary site and/or histology The length of a full course of neoadjuvant systemic therapy may vary depending on the primary site and/or histology, often from 4 -6 months , but could be shorter, of neoadjuvant systemic therapy and/or radiation Neoadjuvant therapy may include sy stemic therapy alone, radiation alone , or combinations of radiation and systemic therapy (for example , with rectal cancer, esophageal cancer, head and neck cancer) SEER Program Coding and Staging Manual 2021 Section VII: First Course of Therapy 224 Code neoadjuvant therapy in the corresponding treatment data items even when the treatment is partial (i.e., less than a full course of neoadjuvant therapy is administered) or limited (i.e ., limited exposure to systemic therapy) Radiation Sequence and Surgery (if radiation given prior to surgical resection ) as part of limited neoadjuvant therapy Systemic Treatment/Surgery Sequence (if systemic treatment given prior to surgical resection ) as part of limited neoadjuvant therapy The appropriate treatment data item s (Chemotherapy, Immunotherapy, Hormone Therapy, Hematologic Transplant and Endocrine Procedures, Radiation Treatment Modality --Phase I, II, III), and the associated date data item for each treatment type Coding Instructions 1.

Patient received 6 cycles of chemotherapy with concurrent radiation and then had surgical resection. Example 2: Patient diagnosed with rectal cancer, 6 cycles of chemotherapy and radiation recommended. After completion of neoadj uvant therapy, re -evaluation of tumor burden done, and no evidence of cancer found. T he planned surgical resection was not performed. Example 3: Patient diagnosed with pancreatic cancer; 6 cycles of chemotherapy recommended. During last cycle, patient deve loped heart issues due to the chemotherapy. Planned s urgical resection not performed due to risk factors and patient placed on hospice. Example 4: Patient completed neoadjuvant therapy, surgery recommended, but patient refused any further treatment or pat ient died prior to surgical resection. Example 5: Patient had a full course of neoadjuvant therapy, surgical resection recommended, unknown if performed. 3. Assign code 2 a. When any tumor -directed therapy (excluding surgical resection) meeting the definition of neoadjuvant t herapy whose intent was neoadjuvant , was begun and the patient did not complete the full course of neoadjuvant therapy Example : Patient d iagnosed with advanced breast cancer; 6 cycles of chemotherapy, followed by surgical resection recommended.

SEER Program Coding and Staging Manual 2021 Section VII: First Course of Therapy 227 Neoadjuvant Therapy effective for cases diagnosed 01/01/2021 and later , records the clinical outcomes of neoadjuvant therapy prior to planned surgical resection. This data item provides information r elated to the quality of care and describes the clinical outcomes after neoadjuvant therapy. Prognostically relevant information is captured by quantifying the extent of therapy- induced tumor regression. T his item can provide a better risk stratification f or patients who received neoadjuvant therapy. In addition, this data item can contribute to assessments of cancer care quality. This data item records the clinical outcomes of neoadjuvant therapy as determined by the managing physician (oncologic surgeon, radiation oncologist or medical oncologist). For the purposes of this data item, neoadjuvant therapy is defined as systemic treatment (chemotherapy, endocrine/hormone therapy, targeted therapy, immunotherapy, or biological therapy) and/or radiation thera py given to shrink a tumor before surgical resection. Coding Guidelines Use this data item to record the clinical response (outcomes) to neoadjuvant therapy. Neoadjuvant Therapy- Clinical Response is evaluated after primary systemic and/or radiation therapy is completed and prior to surgical resection. It is based on clinical history, physical examination, biopsies, imaging studies, and other diagnostic work up. Do not use information from the surgical pathology report to code this data item.

There is no information in the patient's medical record about other therapy AND i. It is known that other therapy is not usually performed for this type and/or stage of cancer OR ii. There is no reason to suspect that the patient would have had other therapy b. The treatment plan offered multiple treatment options and the patient selected treatment that did not include other therapy c. Patient elects to pursue no treatment following the discussion of ot her therapy. Discussion does not equal a recommendation. Patient's decision not to pursue other therapy is not a refusal of other therapy in this situation. d. First course of treatment was active surveillance/watchful waiting e. Patient diagnosed at autopsy 2. Assign code 1 for a. Hematopoietic treatments such as: phlebotomy or aspirin (See SEER*Rx and Hematopoietic and Lymphoid Neoplasm Coding Manual and Database for specific guidance on coding) Note: Do not code blood transfusion as treatment .

Cancer treatment that could not be assigned to the previous treatment data items (surgery, radiation, chemotherapy, im munotherapy, or systemic therapy) 3. Assign code 2 for any experimental or newly developed treatment, such as a clinical trial, that differs greatly from proven types of cancer therapy Note: Hyperbaric oxygen has been used to treat cancer in clinical trials, but it is also used to promote tissue healing following head and neck surgeries. Do not code the administration of hyperbaric oxygen to promote healing as an experimental treatment. 4. Assign code 3 when the patient is enrolled in a double blind clinical tria l. When the trial is complete and the code is broken, review and recode the therapy. 5. Assign code 6 for a. Cancer treatment administered by nonmedical personnel Example : Cannabis oil or medical marijuana that is used for treatment. b. Unconventional methods whether they are the only therapy or are given in combination with conventional therapy Example: DC vax given for brain cancer. Assign code 6. DC vax is not an approved treatment for brain cancer and should not be coded in the immuno therapy or any of the other treatment data item s. c. Complementary and Alternative Medicine (CAM) as any medical system, practice, or product that is not thought of as \"western medicine\" or standard medical care. CAM treatments may include dietary supplements , megadose vitamins, herbal preparations, acupuncture, massage therapy, magnet therapy, spiritual healing, and meditation. i. Alternative medicine is treatment that is used instead of standard medical treatments. Alternative therapy is when the patient receives no other type of standard treatment . ii. Complementary medicine. Treatments that are used along with standard medical treatments but are not standard treatments; also called conventional medicine. One example is using acupuncture to help lessen some side effects of cancer treatment in conjunction with standard treatment . d. Integrative medicine. A total approach to medical care that combines standard medicine with the CAM practices that have shown to be safe and effective. They treat the patient's mind, body, and spirit.

Assign code 8 when other therapy was recommended by the physician but there is no information that the treatment was given 7. Assign code 9 when there is no documentation that other therapy was recommended or performed a. For death certificate only (DCO) cases Coding for Tumor Embolization The American College of Surgeons Commission on Cancer (CoC), the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention National Progr am of Cancer Registries (NPCR), and the SEER Program have collaborated to clarify and refine coding directives for tumor embolization and are jointly issuing the following instructions. Definitions Chemoembolization: A procedure in which the blood supply to the tumor is blocked surgically or mechanically and anticancer drugs are administered directly into the tumor. This permits a higher concentration of drug to be in contact with the tumor for a longer period of time. Radioembolization: Tumor embolization combined with injecting small radioactive beads or coils into an organ or tumor. Tumor embolization: The intentional blockage of an artery or vein to stop the flow of blood through the desired vessel. Coding Instructions Code as \"Other Therapy\" when tumor embolization is performed using alcohol as the embolizing agent. Use code 1. Example: For head and neck primaries: Ideally, an embolic agent is chosen that will block the very small vessels within the tumor but spare the adjacent normal tissue. Liquid embolic agents, such as ethanol or acrylic, and powdered particulate materials can penetrate into the smallest blood vessels of the tumor. Use code 1 for embolization of a tumor in a site other than the liver when the embolizing agent is unknown. Do not code pre -surgical (pre -operative) embolization of hypervascular tumors with agents such as particles, coils, or alcohol as a treatment. Pre-surgical embolization is typically performed to prevent excess bleeding during the resection of the primary tumor. Examples where pre- surgical embolization is used include meningiomas, hemangioblastomas, pa ragangliomas, and renal cell metastases in the brain.

Left justify the codes; if less than four characters, leave the fourth character blank Note: This is a change from previous instructions . 4. If the underlying cause of death code is not available, do not attempt to code the underlying cause of death unless you have a trained ICD -10 nosologist on staff or on consult Priority Order for use of source documents to assign codes, with 1 having the h ighest priority. 1. Use the underlying cause of death as coded by a state health department even if the code seems to be in error 2. Report the coded underlying cause of death code from another source such as NDI Plus or state data exchange 3. Code the underlying cause of death if a trained ICD -10 nosologist is on staff or under contract 4. Code the underlying cause of death as 7797 when the death certificate is available but the underlying cause of death code is not coded and cause of death is not available from another source such as NDI Plus or state data exchange 5. Code 7777 when the death certificate is not available AND the coded underlying cause of death is not available from other sources such as NDI or state data exchange Example: Medical doctor states patient died, but death certificate not available (not on state death file, not available through federal or state agencies); code 7777. Beginning with deaths in 1999, the United States agreed to code all deaths using the International Statistic al Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision (ICD -10). The ICD -10 codes have up to four characters: a letter followed by 2 or 3 digits. SEER Program Coding and Staging Manual 2021 Section VIII: Follow Up Information 246 Examples: Underlying Cause of Death ICD-10 SEER Code Malignant neoplasm of the thyroid stomach C16.9 C169 If the patient has multiple records, the underlying cause of death must be identical on each record. SEER Program Coding and Staging Manual 2021 Section VIII: Follow Up Information 247 Survival Data Items Effective January 1, 2015, there were seven new NAACCR data items to facilitate survival analysis by NAACCR registries. The data item s are derived for SEER registries. For further information on each specific data item, see the NAACCR Data Dictionary and the NAACCR 2015 Implementation Guidelines . Survival Data Items Item # Data Item Name XML Program Coding and Staging Manual 2021 Section IX: Administrative Codes 248 Section IX Administrative Codes Each calendar year the SEER registries submit records to NCI for all persons/ reportable neoplasms diagnosed since the registry started reporting to NCI . Many of these records have been updated with information received by the registry since the prior data submission. NCI edits the information to ensure correctness and comparability of reporting. Some of these edits identify condi tions that require additional review. To eliminate the need to review the same cases each submission, the Administrative Codes section contains a set of indicators used to show that the information in a record has already been reviewed. SEER Program Coding and Staging Manual 2021 Section IX: Administrative Codes 249 Site/Type Interfi (Interfield Edit 25) This data item is used to flag those cases where the primary site and histology are unusual.

It is also used to flag those cases that are in situ and not microscopically confirmed. Code Description Blank Not reviewed or reviewed a nd corrected 1 Reviewed and confirmed that the pathologist states the primary to be \"in situ\" or \"malignant\" although the behavior code of the histology is designated as \"benign\" or \"uncertain\" in ICD -O-2 ICD -O-3 (flag for a \"Morphology Type & Behavior\" edit) 2 Reviewed and confirmed that the behavior code is \"in situ,\" but the case is not microscopically confirmed (flag for a \"Diagnostic Confirmation, Behavior Code\" edit) 3 Reviewed and confirmed that conditions 1 and 2 both apply SEER Program Coding and Staging Manual 2021 Section IX: Administrative Codes 251 Age/Site /Histology (Interfield Edit 15) This data item is used to identify whether a case was reviewed and coding confirmed for those cases with an unusual site/histology combination for a given age -group.

SEER Program Coding and Staging Manual 2021 Section IX: Administrative Codes 263 Over -ride Fl ag for TNM Item Tis This data item , effective 01/01/ 2018 , is used to identify whether a case was reviewed and coding confirmed for a T value of in situ/noninvasive but N, M, and/or stage group indicates invasive disease. There are certain circumstances where AJCC does allow a T value indicating in situ/noninvasive and N, M, and/or stage group that indicates invasive disease. An over -ride is required to accommodate these situations. This over -ride will allow registrars to enter combination of T, N, and M with a stage group that differs from the combinations documented in the AJCC Staging Manual. Code Description Blank Not reviewed, or reviewed and corrected 1 Revi ewed and confirmed as reported SEER Program Coding and Staging Manual 2021 Section IX: Administrative Codes 264 Over -ride Flag for Site/TNM -Stage Item data item , effective 01/01/ 2018 , indicate s whether a case was reviewed and coding confirmed for pediatric cases not coded according to the AJCC manual. Pediatric Stage groups should not be recorded in the TNM Clin ical Stage Group or TNM Pathologic Stage Group items. When neither clinical nor pathologic AJCC staging is used for pediatric cases, code all AJCC items 88. When any components of either is used to stage a pediatric case, follow the instructions for coding AJCC items and leave Over -ride Site/TNM -Stage Group blank.
