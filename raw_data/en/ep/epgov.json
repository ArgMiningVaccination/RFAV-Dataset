Reiki is one of the more widely known forms of energy healing. Considered a complete system of holistic healing and personal development, Reiki is an ancient Japanese practice using \"Universal Life Energy\" or \"God-directed Energy\" for self-healing, the healing of others, developing higher consciousness, and fulfilling a spiritual purpose. At SWIHA we have found that just as there are different learning styles, there are different healing styles. We are committed to offering a variety of ways for you to connect with your healing gifts.

Traditional Reiki On campus - Certificate of Excellence - 100 hours - [Tuition](https://swiha.edu/prospective-students/tuition/) Traditional Reiki is a journey of self-discovery, personal healing and becoming a vessel of healing for others. Traditional Reiki is taught based on the techniques and protocols handed down for generations from Madame Takata's linage. It begins in Reiki I, with focus on the history of Reiki, energy anatomy, self-healing protocol and becoming attuned to the traditional Reiki symbols. Reiki II deepens the understanding and uses for the Traditional Reiki symbols and broadens the practice of Reiki from self-healing, to facilitating healing in others. Reiki III brings the practitioner to the mastership level with attunement to the Reiki Master symbol. While reflecting on the Reiki journey to this point, and being firmly grounded in the present, the practitioner envisions where this practice will lead themselves in the future as a Reiki Master.

The word Shaman means 'spiritual healer' or, 'one who sees in the dark' - which perfectly describes the Reiki experience. Healing protocols are taught in conjunction with ceremony intended align body's genetic makeup with the life energy of Earth, Water, Fire, and Air.. Like an arrow pursuit to target, the purpose of ceremony is to restore wholeness. This approach is considered less structured and organic in nature.

Holy Reiki is bible-based and Christ-centered. Holy Reiki honors and respects all traditions, denominations, beliefs, and walks of faith. This approach is for those who follow the teaching of Christ and wish to draw from the healing principles of hands-on healing as taught in the Bible, as well as evident-based Reiki protocols used in hospice and the medical communities.
