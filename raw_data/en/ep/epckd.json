Some people were afraid of finding out they might be positive. Others didn't have time off work or the transportation to get to test sites. Many were nervous about identification or insurance questions, Zambrano explained. Holy Spirit Catholic Church of Tuscaloosa, which holds services in Spanish, responded by hosting drive-through test centers in the late afternoon hours of summer. \"We went over the amount of tests we had and it went on until night time,\" said Zambrano, who is an organizer with the [Alabama Coalition for Immigrant Justice ](https://www.alimmigrant.org/)and a Holy Spirit parishioner. \"It was successful because people put a lot of trust in the church. Often more than they do in a doctor they've never met.\" Health experts say trusted sources play a key role in reducing anxieties and misinformation about the vaccine especially among hard hit and hard to reach populations including Black and Latino residents in rural parts of the South. With vaccine distribution slowly ramping up, there is a national push to include the voices of trusted community leaders as part of vaccine campaigns. Advocates have raised concerns that barriers to care will significantly reduce vaccine access to vulnerable populations. Mistrust in the medical community, limited access to accurate information, and lack of transportation are among the biggest hurdles. Vaccine availability is still relatively scarce in Alabama. Only about 5% of the population has received the vaccine so far, according to data from the [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.](https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccinations) As availability increases, Father Michael Deering of Holy Spirit Church, said he will feel comfortable sharing information about it with members of his church. \"It's leading by example,\" he said. \"We have been following the CDC guidelines from the beginning. Masks, hand sanitizers are all commonplace at our church. This will be just one more step in that process.\" Pastor doesn't trust vaccine William Morris, the pastor of Locust Grove Baptist Church in Greenwood, Mississippi, for the last 17 years has also been leading by example. Church services have been online-only since spring. With the community in lockdown, the church organized distributions of masks, hand sanitizer and food. When information about testing and COVID-19 safety was limited, the church stepped in. \"Somewhere the ball was dropped. It was up to community leaders to find information and do what we could to educate our people and keep them safe,\" Morris said. \"That's my intention. To be able to provide whatever valuable information to the community that I possibly can. That's my calling. That's my responsibility,\" he said. As the conversation on health and safety has shifted to vaccinations, Morris said he knows he will become a sounding board for parishioners who are hesitant to receive one. \"Some people say they are putting a tracking device in your arm, they've heard it isn't safe, that it was created too quickly. In small communities, rumors spread quickly,\" he said. Robust vaccine efficacy reports are pending, however before the FDA approves any vaccination, clinical trials are conducted [to determine how well it works](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/effectiveness.html), the CDC states. Morris, who has his own reservations, has not signed up for a vaccination and said he needs more information about its safety before he can receive one and encourage others to follow suit. Analysis: Minorities have high infection, low vaccination rates A lag in vaccination rates among Black and Latino residents has been reported across several states. A recent analysis by the [Kaiser Family Foundation](https://www.kff.org/policy-watch/early-state-vaccination-data-raise-warning-flags-racial-equity/) revealed that these populations are getting vaccinated at much lower rates compared to white Americans. Mississippi is among the 17 states that currently provide a breakdown of vaccination data by race. As of Jan. 26, Black residents accounted for only 16% of vaccinations compared to 38% of cases and 42% of COVID-related deaths in Mississippi. The same pattern was reported in North Carolina. Only 11% of Black residents had been vaccinated while accounting for 20% of cases and 21% of COVID-related deaths, according to the analysis. Mississippi state health officer Dr. Thomas Dobbs addressed the low vaccination rates among Black residents recently. He said the state is currently working with small clinics across the state to ensure vaccines \"can get to people who are the most vulnerable.\" To address racial disparities the state will have to \"build trust through leadership, physicians, pastors and preachers,\" he said. This is where groups like the Alabama Coalition for Immigrant Justice play a vital role. The statewide network created a COVID-19 hotline with information in Spanish for residents. They coordinated medicine, food and mask distributions in hard to reach communities across the state. \"When we can't trust leadership in the government, we turn to our community leaders. They are the first source of information they go to,\" said Natividad Gonzalez, an organizer with ACIJ. It's a sentiment Dr. Tabia Akintobi with the Morehouse School of Medicine shares. The school received a $1 million award from the National Institutes of Health last year for COVID-19 pandemic outreach in diverse communities. Dr. Akintobi said health organizations are playing catch up to find those who should be getting vaccinated but aren't and in addition, understanding their attitudes and perceptions about the vaccine. It's a mammoth task that will be greatly facilitated by getting more community leaders involved. \"When the messenger and the message is culturally relevant and responsive the hesitancy is not there,\" she said. \"But when people are ready to engage with the message we have to make sure that we as a system are ready for the demand.\" Maria Clark is a general assignment reporter with The American South.
