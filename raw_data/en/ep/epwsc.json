Hammett, Ph.D.Issues and Findings Discussed in this brief: The extent and nature of public health/corrections col- laborations in the prevention and treat-ment of HIV/AIDS, STDs, and TB, based on responses to the 1997 NIJ/CDC na- tional survey of correctional systems andsite visits to six States and five city/county jurisdictions. Key issues: Correctional populations have higher rates of HIV/AIDS, STDs, TB, and more risk factors for these diseases than the general population. Virtually allinmates return to the community, where they may place themselves and others in danger by engaging in high-risk behav-iors. Collaborations between public health and correctional agencies may help fill gaps in programs for the preven-tion and treatment of HIV/AIDS, STDs, and TB, thereby benefiting an at-risk and underserved population as well as overallpublic health. Key findings: According to NIJ/CDC survey re-sponses, virtually all correctional systems have at least some collaboration with public health agencies. Site visits identified numerous collabo- rations in disease surveillance, testing and screening, followup, education and pre-vention programs, staff training, treat- ment services, and legislation and policy development, but found fewer collabora- tions in discharge planning and transi- tional services for people being released. Most existing collaborations involve public health departments providing funds, staff, or direct services in correc- tional facilities. Programs in Rhode Island and New York State exemplify more comprehen- sive collaborations. Key factors in include:The public health depart- ments and correctional agencies arehighly complementary: Correctional fa-cilities and inmate populations are part ofthe larger community, and public healthis integral to public safety. Public healthand correctional agencies are increas-ingly working together to improve thehealth of inmates and, at the same time,the health of the larger community. More than 1.75 million people are incar- cerated in the prisons and jails of theUnited States\u2014close to 1 percent of theNation's population. 1 Inmates suffer dis- proportionately from infectious diseases,substance abuse, and a constellation ofsocioeconomic In particular,human immunodeficiency and tuberculosis (TB) are farmore prevalent among incarcerated per-sons than the general U.S. population. Figures from a 1994 survey cosponsored by the National Institute of Justice (NIJ)and the Centers for Disease Control andPrevention (CDC) (the NIJ/CDC survey)reveal that AIDS is almost six times moreprevalent among inmates than in the total U.S. population. 2 State and Federal in- mates accounted for about 3 percent ofthe HIV-infected people in the country in1995. 3 Incidence rates of gonorrhea in 1994 were 152 times higher among con-fined juvenile girls and 42 times higheramong confined juvenile boys than amonggirls and boys of equivalent ages in thetotal population. 4 Comparisons are more difficult to make regarding TB, but thenumbers in themselves are telling. Basedon 1994 data from 31 State prison sys-tems, the purified protein derivative(PPD) skin-test positivity rate (which in-dicates TB infection) among inmates wasalmost 14 percent, while 25 prison sys-tems reported that more than 5,600 in-mates converted from negative to positivePPDs in the 2 years prior to the NIJ/CDC survey. 5 In addition, risk factors for these infections are much higher inincarcerated populations than in thepopulation at large. Adult inmates and confined juveniles represent a large, highly at-risk popula-tion that could benefit greatly from healthinterventions. Such interventions couldalso greatly benefit overall publichealth. 6,7 Many correctional systems havePartners in Research on Correctional Health Care2R e s e a r c h i n B r i e f Issues and Findings continued... - Availability of data on disease bur- den or dramatic events such as out- breaks demonstrating the need for collaborations. - Organizational, legislative, or regu- latory provisions such as health de- partment responsibility for provision ofhealth services in correctional facilities; or legislation or regulations requiring oversight mechanisms, screening, ordisease reporting. - Attitudes and philosophies such as commitment to collaboration atagency and facility levels; correctional agency willingness to open its facilities to outside organizations; and mutualsensitivity to concerns, priorities, and perspectives of corrections and public health personnel. - Health department funding of programs in correctional facilities and operational features such asthe presence of health department personnel in correctional facilities, liaison staff in correctional and pub-lic health agencies, formal agree- ments for collaboration (such as MOUs), and long-standing inter-agency relationships. - Communication and information exchange such as correctional repre-sentation on HIV Prevention Planning Groups, service on joint committees, regularly held meetings at leadershipand operational levels, and the ex- change of important information about patients. Recommendations: The key recom- mendations of the NIJ/CDC study involve implementing the following fourkey facilitators of collaboration: Public health agency collection and dissemination of data on the burden ofinfectious disease in inmate populations. Including correctional representation on all HIV Prevention Planning Groups. Public health agency initiation or ex- pansion of funding for services and staff in correctional facilities. Public health and correctional agency recognition of the importance and potential benefits of interventions incorrectional settings to the health of the larger community. Target audience: Correctional admin- istrators, public health agency adminis- trators, correctional health services staff, public health agency staff, and legisla-tors and other policymakers concerned with public health and criminal justice.responded to this need and opportunity by instituting a variety of these interventions.However, the 1997 NIJ/CDC survey resultsreveal that numerous gaps remain. Lessthan two-thirds (61 percent) of State andFederal correctional facilities were provid-ing instructor-led HIV/AIDS sessions, andonly 13 percent were providing peer-ledprograms. 8 Other areas of insufficient ser- vices include discharge planning and conti-nuity of medical services from correctionalfacilities to the community. Overall, morecoordination is needed between services inthese two domains.Collaborations between public health and correctional agencies represent a poten-tial means of filling these and other gapsin health-related services for inmates.Public health departments may have thefunds, staff, expertise, and other re-sources to help prisons, jails, and juve-nile facilities address the serious healthneeds of their inmates and thereby ad-vance the cause of public health in theircommunities. Consistent with their overall public safety and security missions, prisons and jails Survey and Site Visit Methodologies he ninth national NIJ/CDC survey of HIV/AIDS, STDs, and TB in correctional facilitieswas conducted in 1996 and 1997. Responseswere received from all 50 State departmentsof correction, 41 of the largest city/county jailsystems, and the Federal Bureau of Prisons.Following that, the survey was validated usingan abbreviated version of the questionnairewith 50 individual facilities in 15 State correc-tional systems and the Federal Bureau of Pris-ons. The objective of the validation was tocompare responses on key policy issues fromindividual facilities with responses from thecentral offices of their State departments ofcorrections. As a followup to the national NIJ/CDC survey, a series of 11 site visits also was conducted in1997 to determine the extent and nature ofpublic health/corrections collaborations in theprevention and treatment of HIV/AIDS, STDs,and TB. Site visits were made to the following 6 States and 5 city/county-level jurisdictions byteams from Abt Associates, the Centers forDisease Control and Prevention, and theNational Institute of Justice: States - Florida.- Illinois.- Missouri.T Cities and Counties - San Francisco, California.- Chicago (Cook County), Illinois.- Rochester (Monroe County), New York. - Memphis (Shelby County), Tennessee.- Houston (Harris County), Texas. The sites were chosen based on tele- phone interviews with more than 20 juris-dictions that had been identified by CDCand Abt Associates. The final site selec-tions were made with a view toward geo-graphic diversity and having an even mixof State and city/county jurisdictions. The 2-day visits included interviews with correctional and public health staff aswell as visits to correctional and juvenileconfinement facilities. Key public healthstaff in HIV/AIDS, STDs, and TB and cor-rectional health services staff and othersin the correctional systems who were in-volved in collaborations with publichealth departments were interviewed.The study team visited the major jail facil-ity in each city/county and one or two fa-cilities in each State. - New York. - Rhode Island.- Washington.3R e s e a r c h i n B r i e f can create opportunities for interven- tions with underserved populations whoare at high risk for HIV/AIDS, STDs,and TB. Correctional administratorscan provide access to these populationsand otherwise facilitate interventions byincluding language requiring early dis-ease detection and treatment in theirhealth protocols. Such language may beparticularly important where health ser-vices are being provided through con-tracts with private organizations. The study described in this report ex- amined the extent and nature of publichealth/corrections collaborations inthe prevention and treatment of HIV/AIDS, STDs, and TB. A description of the methodologies used for the surveyand the site visits is found in \"Surveyand Site Visit M ethodologies.\" As expected, the study revealed that State health departments collaboratedprimarily with State correctional agen-cies, while city and county health de-partments worked primarily withcounty jails. However, there were nu-merous interactions between Statehealth departments and county jails.In addition, collaborations between State correctional systems and countyjails were very important, but some-times inadequate, particularly in thearea of information exchange. The study occasionally touched on collabo- rations between corrections and other enti-ties such as community-basedorganizations (CBOs) and academic medi-cal centers. Indeed, a range of potentialcollaborators could be identified for futureprogram development and research efforts. This report first summarizes collabora- tions reported to the 1997 NIJ/CDC sur-vey and those identified during site visitsfor this study. Two brief case studies arethen presented, followed by a discussionof the factors important in successful col-laboration. The report concludes withpolicy implications for improving and ex-panding collaborations. Diversity of collaborative efforts Collaborations between public healthand correctional agencies encompass awide variety of activities in the preven-tion and treatment of HIV/AIDS,STDs, and TB (see exhibit 1). Re- sponses to the 1997 NIJ/CDC surveyof correctional systems show that col-laborative efforts are common andwide ranging. Virtually all State andFederal prison systems (98 percent)and city/county jail systems (90 per-cent) reported some collaboration witha public health department in the sur-veillance, prevention, and treatment ofHIV/AIDS, STDs, or TB. The appendix (pages 16 and 17) sum- marizes the diverse collaborative ef-forts identified during the site visits to11 jurisdictions within the followingbroad headings: Administration and infrastructure. Policy development. Service delivery.Many collaborations exist in disease surveillance, staff training, legislationand policy development, education/pre-vention programs, testing/screening/followup, and treatment services, asshown in the appendix.

The organizational chartof Rhode Island's AIDS Services After Prison(ASAP) program, a centerpiece of theState's collaborative efforts, is displayed inexhibit 2. Meetings and interactions between all of the organizational partners in the Rhode Is-land collaboration take place regularly. Thepartners also work together on disease sur-veillance, policies, legislative proposals, andunion issues in the facilities. There is a de-monstrable commitment to working to-gether. In the words of the administratorof the Rhode Island health department'soffice of HIV/STDs, there is no sense of\"our problem versus your problem.\" The Department of Health provided much of the initial funding for staffing the pro-gram. However, over time, the programhas been institutionalized and theDepartment of Corrections has picked upan increasing share of personnel costs,funding two public health educator posi-tions from its regular budget. In 1986 collaboration between the Rhode Island health and correctional de-partments led to the development of oneof the first correctional AIDS policies inthe United States. Early on, treatmentand supportive services for inmates withHIV and continuity of care between pro-Rhode Island's Model of CollaborationR viders in prison and in the community wereimportant goals of this collaboration. 9 Sub- sequently, pretest and posttest counseling,discharge and HIV-negative inmateswere added. The legislatively mandated implementation of HIV-antibody testing for incoming in-mates in 1989 and the expansion of TB andSTD screening in Rhode Island correctionalfacilities provided data that made a com-pelling case for health programming. Thecorrectional department completes surveil-lance reports on HIV, STDs, and TB andprovides those reports to the health depart-ment. The correctional department also no-tifies the health department's TB unit whena person with active or suspected TB or onTB prophylaxis is being released so continu-ity of care can be arranged. Postrelease services for inmates with HIV infection or at risk for HIV infection includemedical treatment, housing, substanceabuse treatment, job development, psycho-social support, and long-term case manage-ment. 10 Evaluation results reveal reduced recidivism rates among female inmates whoparticipated in these programs. 11 Compli- ance with postrelease medical and otherappointments for services increased dramati-cally as well. Program staff participate in a weekly case- assignment meeting to discuss communitylinkages and placements for inmates nearingrelease. Four key community-based organi-zations that specialize in the following popu-lations and services participate in thesemeetings: 1) mentoring for employable women; 2) services for cocaine- persons; 3) services forlong-term sex workers and/or injectiondrug users; and 4) services for HIV-infected persons. A disease investigation specialist, whose position is funded by the Department ofHealth and who is based at the correc-tional facility, notifies inmates' sexualpartners and performs outreach, primarilyHIV. The specialist also locates HIV-posi-tive individuals who have been releasedto the community before receiving theirtest results and links them to services atMiriam Hospital or a comparable providerof HIV services. The CDC funding of two additional public health educator positions in the Depart-ment of Corrections has increased theoverall program's emphasis on preven-tion. These educators orient incoming in-mates on infectious diseases, providemultisession prevention programs for cur-rent inmates and educational sessions forstaff, and coordinate inmate peer educa-tion programs. Health department staff have met with the correctional officers' union to addressissues surrounding disclosure of inmates'HIV status. The union favored disclosureto all correctional officers, but a compro-mise was achieved whereby disclosuremay occur only in the case of potentialtransmission incidents, which are theprimary concern of the union.5R e s e a r c h i n B r i e f Exhibit 2: Rhode Island AIDS Services After Prison (ASAP) Organizational Chart Department of HealthDepartment of CorrectionsMiriam Hospital/ Brown University Office of Communicable DiseasesHealth Care Services Medical Director Office of AIDS/STDs/TB AIDS Team (ASAP) SupervisorImmunologic Center Physicians and Fellows Partner NotificationTesting/ CounselingDischarge PlanningPeer Education Community Affiliates AIDS Service ProvidersMedical Services Drug Treatment Programs Case Management Housing Services State/Federal Agencies Support Groups Counseling Hotline Referral Services Spiritual Support Hospital-Based Clinics Health Centers HIV Centers Clinical Trials Methadone 12-Step Residential Outpatient Mental Health Hospice AIDS Housing Shelters Domestic Abuse Shelters U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs R.I.

Inorder to succeed, such arrangementsrequire interaction and cooperation be-tween public health and correctionalagencies as well as access to inmatepopulations. However, some collabora-tions go well beyond health depart-ments providing services in prisons andjails. See \"Rhode Island's Model and \"New York Collaboration\" for brief casestudies of two such collaborations. The following factors are common to successful collaborations between pub-lic health and correctional agencies: Data and events demonstrating a need for collaboration. Organizational, legislative, and regulatory provisions. Appropriate attitudes and philosophies. Program funding and operations. Communication and information exchange. Data and events demonstrating a need for collaboration Successful public health/corrections collaborations are much easier to de-velop and sustain when data docu- menting the burden of disease in the inmate population are readily avail-able. Some might suggest that suchdata are a prerequisite for successfulcollaborations. Public health depart-ments could be more proactive in dis-ease surveillance among correctionspopulations. Better surveillance mightproduce a whole series of positive ef-fects: more resources for correctionalhealth programs, better services, a safer and healthier environment for in-mates and staff, less disease returnedto the community, and ultimately im-proved public health. In Rhode Island, for example, the health and correctional departmentsdemonstrated that 42 percent of all newHIV infections in the State were identi-fied in correctional facilities. This con-vinced the State's HIV PreventionPlanning Group to endorse substantialcontinued funding of collaborative HIVprograms in prisons. Until these datawere available, the planning group hadexpressed skepticism about the valueand importance of prison-based pro-grams. In Florida, data showing that 13percent of the State's syphilis morbiditywas identified in correctional facilitiesserved as an important impetus for col-laborative STD screening programs. InWashington, the State health depart-ment documents and publishes periodicreports on STD morbidity in adult andjuvenile facilities, which helps justifythe department's continued involve-ment in STD screening and followupprograms in these facilities. Because of low success in locating people released from Cook County Jailbefore syphilis treatment could begiven, a rapid screening and treatmentprogram for women in the jail was initi-ated. As a result, the percentage ofChicago's total syphilis morbidity iden-tified at Cook County Jail increasedfrom 17 percent in 1995 to 24 percentin 1996. The rapid screening and treat-ment program is a collaborative effort ofCDC, the Chicago Department ofHealth, and the Cook County Jail. Without hard data on the incidence and prevalence of HIV/AIDS, STDs, andTB, it is much more difficult to interestcorrectional and health departments incollaborating on interventions. It is also more difficult to justify requests forfunding and other resources if thescope of the problem is unknown orundemonstrated. In some jurisdictionsvisited for this study, for example, jailmedical services and public health de-partment staff have no clear picture ofmorbidity among the inmates. The lackof this information is, in their view, amajor stumbling block to more effectiveand better supported collaboration. Dramatic events may call attention to the need for collaboration. For ex-ample, concern raised by the 1991outbreak of multidrug-resistant TB inNew York State and by other local out-breaks was mentioned in a number ofjurisdictions as a factor promoting col-laboration between public health andcorrections. The New York outbreakprompted the formation of a city/county TB task force in Chicago. In New York State, health department involvement in TB interventions thathelped to protect correctional staffsmoothed the way for other collabora-tions on HIV/AIDS and STDs. Staff inseveral jurisdictions identified col-laborations TB prevention, withtheir strong employee protection focus,as the \"foot in the door\" for other col-laborative efforts. Organizational, legislative, and regulatory provisions In San Francisco and Memphis the health department is responsible forproviding health services in the correc-tional facilities . Such arrangements re- quire interaction and may help fosterfuller collaboration. In San Francisco,for example, the director of forensicservices, the health department unitresponsible for jail health services, sitson several committees with sheriff's7R e s e a r c h i n B r i e f department staff and, in turn, involves custody staff in health services com-mittees. Nurses also meet regularlywith custody captains to address is-sues in health services delivery. Another important factor promoting collaboration is legislative and regula- tory provisions . Strong State legislation in New York called for establishmentof an interagency AIDS task force,which required that the commissionersof the State health and correctionaldepartments and other agenciescoordinate efforts in criminal justicesettings. C alifornia law requiring notifi- cation to health departments of all TBcases was a spur to collaborations withcorrectional systems in the developmentof reporting procedures. Also in Califor-nia, the legislatively created State Boardof Corrections has the power to regulatelocal and county jails. The board's regu-lations require that each jail has a com- municable disease control plan jointlycreated by jail officials and the localhealth officer. A Texas law enacted in1993 requires all jails with 100 or morebeds to submit TB control plans to thelocal health department. The Memphis-Shelby County health of- ficer used the powers granted him un-der Tennessee law to mandate PPDscreening for TB in jails. Indeed, thejail director also favored PPD screeningbut asked the health director to requireit in order to provide stronger justifica-tion and gain the cooperation of jailstaff. A 1988 Washington State law pro-vides for court-ordered HIV testing ofinmates involved in potential transmis-sion incidents, as well as convicted in-jection drug users, sex offenders, andsex workers. The correctional and juve-nile agencies sought and obtained theinvolvement of the State health depart-ment in providing this mandated testingand reporting its results.Attitudes and philosophies Three important attitudes and philoso- phies of key actors in public healthand corrections systems appear tofacilitate successful collaboration: Strong commitment. Willingness to open facilities to outside agencies. Sensitivity to the concerns of both corrections and public health. At the level of agency and facility leadership, there must be a strong commitment to collaborative ap- proaches. This may involve a realiza-tion and declaration that infectiousdiseases among inmates represent botha correctional and a public healthproblem. As the county jail director inMemphis emphasized, public health isa part of the public safety that correc-tional facilities exist to protect. TheFlorida Department of Corrections'assistant secretary for health servicesstated that \"the health problems of ourinmates are public health problemsbecause inmates go back to the com-munity.\" In Illinois, the director of thecorrectional department endorsed aninmate peer education program spon-sored by the health department andwrote to all facility superintendentsencouraging their cooperation. Correctional officials' commitment to collaborative approaches generallyleads to their willingness to open their facilities to outside organizations . This is not always easy for correctional ad-ministrators to do, in view of their pri-mary concern with security. They mayalso be wary of outsiders, based ontheir perceptions or experiences thatoutsiders' main purpose is to find andexpose fault in correctional facilities.Even when central office leaders in acorrectional system direct that therebe open collaboration, individual su- perintendents may still attempt to pre-vent it in their facilities. Numerous superintendents, however, are open to the involvement of outsideagencies. Some, like the warden ofRhode Island's women's facility, seesuch involvement as essential. She wel-comes outside medical providers, com-munity-based organizations, studentinterns, and others to her facility. Shebelieves that prisons are part of thecommunity and that there should not be\"impenetrable walls\" between them.Moreover, she believes that outside pro-viders are helpful to inmates in makingtransitions back to the community. If correctional and public health agen- cies are to work together successfully,they must have sensitivity to each other's concerns . It is important, for ex- ample, that public health staff under-stand that security is, and always willbe, the first priority of correctionalsystems. Public health activities mustbe accommodated within the overallcorrectional structure and procedures.As a public health investigator fromthe Houston health department's TBsection commented, one must \"easein,\" work with security staff, abide bytheir rules, and try to build one-on-onerelationships. Taking this approach,this public health investigator was ac-cepted as \"one of them [the deputies]\"and enjoys their full cooperation.Similarly, the San Francisco healthdepartment's TB control staff personworking in the jails has achieved goodcooperation from custody staff by\"requesting rather than demanding\"assistance. In Washington State, thecorrectional department creditedhealth department staff with being ex-tremely collegial, focusing on findingsolutions rather than finding fault.8R e s e a r c h i n B r i e f New York State's Model of CollaborationC ollaborations between the New York State Department of Health (DOH)and the Department of Correctional Ser-vices (DOCS) on HIV/AIDS and TB involvealmost constant interaction between thetwo agencies at both central office andfacility levels. Collaborations on STDs havebeen primarily between DOH and because DOH staff believe that thekey opportunity for STD intervention is atthe jail level and is essentially lost once in-mates move on to DOCS facilities. Beginnings of collaboration. The AIDS Institute of the New York State DOH andDOCS began their collaboration in 1987.The institute's Criminal Justice Initiative(CJI) involves a comprehensive array ofHIV/AIDS services in DOCS facilities, suchas HIV counseling and testing, education(including peer education programs pro-vided by ex-offenders and current in-mates), and supportive and transitionalservices for inmates living with HIVdisease. Facility-level cooperation. Institute staff emphasize that their involvement hasbeen and remains dependent on the co-operation of individual facilities' superin-tendents, which, with the substantialassistance of DOCS central office staff,they have been quite successful in win-ning and maintaining. State-level cooperation. The DOH Bu- reau of HIV/AIDS Epidemiology (AIDS Epi)and DOCS have collaborated on HIV/AIDSsurveillance. The AIDS Institute and DOCShave also collaborated on the develop-ment of medical protocols and a qualityreview of HIV medical services. A memo-randum of understanding between DOCSand the AIDS Institute for ongoing case-based quality review of HIV medical ser-vices was under development at the timeof the site visit.In 1989 the AIDS Institute and DOCS initi- ated a joint project in which DOCS fundedpositions in the institute to form regionalteams to provide HIV counseling and test-ing for inmates and educational programsfor inmates and correctional staff. Thisproject was closely coordinated by the cen-tral offices of both agencies, and DOCS re-viewed and approved the educationalcurriculums. Funding was also provided forAIDS Counseling and Education (ACE), apeer-based prevention and support pro-gram at the Bedford Hills women's facility.In 1992, the Women's Prison Initiative wasestablished by the AIDS Institute to replicatethe ACE peer education model at the otherwomen's facilities and to provide a compre-hensive continuum of care for HIV-infectedfemales. Services provided at Albion,Taconic, and Bedford Hills correctional fa-cilities include peer training, peer-deliverededucation on HIV/AIDS prevention and riskreduction, HIV counseling and testing, sup-portive services for HIV-infected inmates,and discharge planning and case manage-ment for inmates with HIV disease. The AIDS in Prison Hotline project, funded by the AIDS Institute and operated by theOsborne Association in New York City, pro-vides counseling, education, support, andreferrals to community-based services for in-mates. Inmate collect calls are encouraged. CBOs brought in. In 1993 the regional teams serving DOCS facilities were ex-panded to include community-based organi-zations (CBOs). DOCS, CDC, the AIDSInstitute, and other sources provide about$3 million per year for CJI activities. MostDOCS facilities now receive servicesthrough the AIDS Institute's CJI. AIDS Institute staff reported that relations between the regional teams, the CBOs, andDOCS central office and facility staff aregenerally good. Although only about 25percent of the funding for CJI activitiescomes from DOCS, interdepartmental communication and collaboration at thecentral office level are essential. At the fa-cility level, the regional teams and CBOsare often accepted as part of the facility'sstaff. Initial and ongoing meetings onAIDS Institute programs at the facilitylevel help ensure mutual understandingof roles and expectations and addressemerging issues. Correctional officers'union representatives and inmate liaisonsare included in these meetings. HIV-seroprevalence studies. In the late 1980s, AIDS Epi began collaborating withDOCS on a series of blinded studies ofHIV seropositivity among incoming in-mates at the reception centers\u2014Down-state and Ulster for men, and BedfordHills for women. When it became clearthat HIV seropositivity rates among in-mates accepting voluntary testing weresubstantially lower than rates found inthe blinded studies, the AIDS Instituteand DOCS collaborated on a pilot studyat Ulster to investigate these discrepan-cies. The 1994 study revealed that manyinmates did not accept voluntary testingbecause they denied or underestimatedthe seriousness of their risk factors. Priorknowledge of HIV status was not a majorreason for inmates to decline voluntarytesting. AIDS reporting extended. AIDS surveil- lance for DOCS inmates was essentiallypassive until 1996; inmate cases were notreported to DOH by DOCS. Only inmatesadmitted to a hospital for an AIDS-relatedillness were reported. In 1996, however,DOCS began providing DOH with an elec-tronic database of case reports for allinmates known to have AIDS. This facili-tated cross-checking case registries andhelped increase the accuracy of casecounts. continued...9R e s e a r c h i n B r i e f Showing a willingness to compromise on policy issues is another way todemonstrate mutual concern and sen-sitivity. For example, the director offorensic services in the San Franciscohealth department compromised withthe sheriff's department on the imple-mentation of a State referendum ondisclosure of inmates' HIV status tocorrectional officers. The compromisecarefully restricted recipients of theinformation and provided for coding ofthe information to minimize the possi-bility of unauthorized disclosure.Counterproductive factors. While the factors elucidated above can helpfacilitate successful collaborations, it isimportant to realize that there are real differences between the philosophies, per-spectives, and priorities of public healthand correctional agencies that can make collaboration difficult if they are not sen-sitively handled . For example, the medi- cal staff in the jail may align withsecurity staff rather than with publichealth staff. In Rochester/MonroeCounty, New York, health departmentstaff reported that when they first beganproviding services in the jail, thereseemed to be a \"clash of cultures\" be- tween them and jail health staff. Sincethat time, however, a mutual respect forthe different perspectives and challengesof each organization has led to collabora-tive and collegial relations. In Roches-ter, important improvements were madeafter a public health nurse spent time inthe jail observing the work of her coun-terpart on the jail health staff. Throughthis experience, the public health nursegained an appreciation of the danger,stress, and other challenges of workingin the jail and developed great respectfor the jail health staff.continued...New York State's Model of Collaboration Success in TB control. Since 1988, the New York State DOH Bureau of TB Con-trol and DOCS have had extensive and,according to DOH staff, \"exemplary\" col-laborations in screening, treatment, casemanagement, surveillance, outbreak in-vestigation, discharge planning, educa-tion and training of staff and inmates,and technical assistance to staff. TB casesin DOCS have declined steadily sincereaching a peak in 1993. No TB out-breaks have occurred in DOCS facilitiessince 1993. In 1988 and 1993, the New York State DOH's Bureau of Occupational Healthassessed air-handling systems in DOCS fa-cilities to better control TB. Training in en-vironmental infection control measuresand monitoring of negative pressurerooms was also given. DOH staff workedclosely with DOCS and CDC staff to inves-tigate and respond to a 1991 outbreak ofmultidrug-resistant TB. This included devel-opment and implementation of manda-tory annual inmate and staff screening,education and training, and other mea-sures to prevent recurrent outbreaks of TB.HIV-related TB project. From 1991 to 1995, DOH collaborated with DOCS on theHIV-Related TB Project (HRTP). This estab-lished a demonstration screening and di-rectly observed preventive therapy programat DOCS intake facilities. DOH conductedTB surveillance at DOCS facilities, andDOCS carried out all screening and treat-ment of inmates. Two public health representatives (PHRs) from the DOH Bureau of TB Control are based at aDOCS reception center, where they are wellintegrated with health service staff. Anothereight PHRs collectively visit each prison every 2weeks to identify and report new suspectedcases of TB and monitor treatment. In gen-eral, the PHRs work closely with the DOCS in-fection control nurses at the prisons on TBcontrol, screening, and treatment issues. DOHstaff conduct all surveillance and case trackingand consult on contact investigations andcase management in DOCS facilities. PHRs re-port possible AIDS cases they identify to theAIDS Epi staff at DOH. The process of com-pleting clinical records is automated so theappropriate PHR can be notified and receivecase records immediately when an inmate istransferred to a facility in a different part ofthe State. Regular meetings and interactionsbetween DOH and DOCS staff are devoted to surveillance, including reconciliation ofcase counts and other matters. DOH's TBnurse coordinator meets every 2 weekswith the DOCS director of communicabledisease control who supervises the infectioncontrol nurses in the prisons. DOH's TBBureau works with DOCS and the paroledepartment on discharge planning for in-mates with TB, as well as on communitylinkages and monitoring of adherence totreatment regimens following release. STD control in county jails. As men- tioned, collaborations on STD serviceshave largely occurred between the Statehealth department and county jails. In ademonstration project funded by CDC atthe Nassau County jail, DOH staff pro-vided rapid syphilis screening at intakeand treatment of inmates with positivetests and no record of prior treatment.This intervention had a significant andpositive effect on syphilis morbidity in theoverall community. The STD control divi-sion of DOH is working on similar pro-grams with jails in Monroe, Westchester,and Chautauqua counties, as well as inNew York City.10R e s e a r c h i n B r i e f The focus of the jail health staff is on emergency medicine and providingneeded care within the context ofmaintaining safety and security. Pub-lic health activities and objectivessuch as disease tracking and followupare not as high a priority for jail healthstaff. By contrast, the health depart-ment staff who work in the jail placetheir highest priority on proactive pub-lic health activities such as screening,disease tracking, followup, and re-search. Nevertheless, the Rochester ex-perience demonstrates that throughmutual understanding, common groundcan be discovered and effective col-laborations achieved. To be successful in the correctional environment, health department staffneed to be able to work within the sys-tem and the rules. They cannot be con-frontational and demand cooperationand then expect to succeed. Accordingto the assistant health director in theRochester health department, staffshould beware of becoming inmate ad-vocates and denouncing the system.Rather, they should focus on advanc-ing the overall public health. The director of medical services at the county jail in Houston described thediffering perspectives by using themetaphor of a spoked wheel. To healthservices and public health staff, every-thing revolves around providing pa-tient care and addressing healthissues. To correctional staff, in con-trast, health issues represent only onespoke of the wheel. Lack of mutual respect and sensitivity can undermine collaborations . For ex- ample, health services and publichealth staff should not dismiss or ig-nore the concerns of correctional staffregarding occupational exposure toHIV and other diseases. As long asthese concerns are based on actual risk of transmission, they should beaddressed with respect and serious-ness. Correctional officers' unions areoften in the forefront on issues of occu-pational risk. These unions may op-pose inmate peer education programsor other programs that involveex-offenders entering jail facilities. Awillingness to take these concerns se-riously and to be open to compromiseon them is essential. In New YorkState, a compromise was reached thatallowed ex-offenders to present educa-tional sessions for inmates but not forcorrectional staff. Collaborations also suffer if public health staff devalue the skills and ex-pertise of correctional medical staff andother correctional staff. In several juris-dictions, correctional health care staffreported being treated with disrespectby health department personnel. At onefacility, the health services staff em-ployed by the correctional departmentresent what they view as an inappropri- ate supervisory and oversight approachtaken by State health department staffwho come into the prison . In other words, the correctional health servicesstaff want acknowledgment of and re-spect for their expertise\u2014instead ofconcern that they will not performproperly unless closely supervised. Thenurse administrator at this facility de-clared that \"until you treat people asequals, you can't collaborate; you canonly dictate.\" At the central office levelin this jurisdiction, key health servicesstaff expressed concern about languagesuggesting similar suspicious assump-tions that was included in proposedterms of a memorandum of understand-ing between the departments of healthand corrections. Health services staff of several other State correctional systems reported countyhealth department personnel, stigmatizing them as inferior practitioners who couldnot find jobs elsewhere, demanding coop-eration, and refusing to work within cor-rectional rules and regulations. Conversely, obstructionism and lack of cooperation by correctional staff can undermine collaborative efforts . For ex- ample, security staff may hinder in-mates' access to health services. In onejurisdiction, it was reported that thecorrectional officers who prepared thesick-call lists sometimes allegedly de-nied access to inmates needing ser-vices. Gate-clearance problemssometimes also allegedly have made itdifficult for health department staff toprovide services efficiently. Program funding and operations The following funding and operational factors were found to facilitatecollaboration: Health department funding of pro- grams in corrections. Presence of health department staff and programs in correctional facilities. Presence of a liaison person. Formal agreements for collaborations. Staff characteristics. Longstanding relationships.Funding by health department. Funding is almost always a facilitatingfactor in collaborations. The director ofmedical services at the county jail inHouston said that collaboration couldbe based on the health department'sability and willingness to fill and payfor gaps in services and expertise. InRhode Island, the health departmentprovided much of the initial fundingfor the collaborative HIV/AIDS pro-grams in the correctional facilities, butthe Department of Corrections was11R e s e a r c h i n B r i e f subsequently able to institutionalize the program and bring some of thecosts into its budget. In contrast, perhaps the most pervasive barriers to collaborative efforts are in-adequate funding and resource con-straints. Even the most powerfularguments for public health interven-tions, no matter how well grounded indata, may be denied adequate supportin the current political climate empha-sizing the punitive over the rehabilita-tive functions of corrections. Most ofthe collaborative programs observed inthis study were working under seriousconstraints on funds, staff, and space.In one jurisdiction visited, the publichealth department suggested that jailhealth staff resisted more aggressivescreening for HIV and STDs becausesufficient funds were not available totreat all the patients who might bediagnosed. Physical plant and staffing. One ju- risdiction reported that no infrastruc- ture or space was available in the city jail to expand disease screening andoffer other health services in which thehealth department might collaborate.In addition, staffing shortages at thissame city facility would prompt resis-tance to escorting inmates to healthservices even if such health serviceswere available. A jail director inter-viewed for the study acknowledgedthat the staff and facilities were inad-equate to support more proactivehealth services. Public health staff working in several other correctional facilities reportedfrequent problems with the callout andescort of inmates to attend medical ser- vices. These problems were attributedto a combination of staff shortages andobstructionism or lack of interest on thepart of security staff.Presence of public health programs. The physical presence of public health pro- grams and staff in correctional facilities has promoted\u2014in many cases, necessi-tated\u2014collaboration. As describedearlier, jail teams and staff from publichealth departments regularly work in thecorrectional facilities of the jurisdictionsvisited for this report, performing a vari- ety of functions including screening, sur-veillance, education and training, contactinvestigation and partner elicitation, andfollowup. Liaison. A liaison at the central office or facility level often makes collabora-tion easier to manage and sustain. InNew York State, each facility has desig-nated a single liaison for State healthdepartment programs\u2014usually thenurse administrator or deputy superin-tendent for programs. This individualarranges gate clearances, sets up ap-pointments, and ensures inmate accessto services. In Illinois, the departmentof corrections' public health coordinatorserves as the liaison for all health de-partment programs and helps the pro-grams gain acceptance at the facilitylevel. A similar correctional liaison tothe State health department in Floridahas proven to be very useful. Formal agreements. Embodying col- laborations in formal agreements has been helpful in several jurisdictions.Memorandums of understanding(MOUs) and similar instruments help toinstitutionalize collaborative efforts,making less dependent on per-sonal relationships. Rhode Island'sbroad-based HIV/AIDS collaborationsinvolving the health and correctionaldepartments, an academic medical cen-ter, and numerous CBOs are formalizedin written agreements. From 1990 to 1996, the New York State Department of Health had an MOUwith the Parole Division to provide transitional services for HIV-infectedinmates. Because the covered serviceswere rolled into other contractsawarded in 1997, the MOU was not re-newed. An MOU with the Division forYouth covering education, counseling,and testing services is still in place. In Washington State, MOUs between the health and correctional depart-ments and the juvenile agency specifyroles and responsibilities regardingcourt-ordered HIV testing. Other documents can also formalize collaborative efforts. For example, thestrategic plan of the Florida depart-ment of corrections requires collabora-tion with the health department andother community resources. Staff characteristics. In several visited jurisdictions it appeared that certain staff characteristics make collaborations easier to forge and maintain. For example, inHouston, both the director of medical ser-vices in the county jail and the supervisorof the health department's jail team men-tioned that having a security backgroundwas useful for jail health services staff.The health department's jail team super-visor worked in corrections and criminaljustice before assuming his current roleand noted that this background helpedhim both negotiate the jail system andwin quicker acceptance from securitystaff. The director of medical services inHouston worked for many years in secu-rity before taking his present position. Hebelieves that when the director of medicalservices is a sheriff's department em-ployee rather than an employee of anotheragency or a contracted organization, he orshe has more leverage and authority toadvance public health objectives in thejail setting. In both New York State and Illinois, the key liaison to the health depart-12R e s e a r c h i n B r i e f ment in the correctional department previously worked for the health de-partment. This background helped theliaison not only to understand andcommit to a public health approachbut also to develop working relation-ships with health department staffmore easily. Relationships. Finally, longstanding relationships and the passage of time often are required to perfect collabora-tion. In Washington State, for example,the health and correctional depart-ments were at one time part of thesame State agency, so they have a longhistory of working together. In RhodeIsland, the collaborative HIV/AIDSprogram was developed and refinedover a period of 10 years. Communication and information exchange Opportunities to discuss issues and exchange information are important todeveloping and sustaining collabora-tions. The study identified four factorsthat improve communication and infor-mation exchange: Correctional representation on HIV Prevention Planning Groups. Health and correctional department service on other joint committees. Regular meetings at leadership and operational levels. Exchange of important patient information. Representation on planning groups. Correctional representation on HIV Prevention Planning Groups is the most important factor in this cat-egory. These groups are mandated byCDC in all States and cities receivingCDC HIV prevention funds. The Pre-vention Planning Groups often havesubstantial influence on the allocation of HIV prevention funding. In Rhode Island, a correctional staffer is a member of the State's Prevention Plan- ning Group. In San Francisco, a represen-tative of the health department's ForensicAIDS Project, which provides HIV pre-vention programs in the jails, serves inthe HIV Prevention Planning Group. In Chicago/Cook County, a representa- tive of the city health department'sSTD program (who was an advocate forcorrectional needs) serves in the HIVPrevention Planning Group. This rep-resentative presented jail data to theplanning group and successfully lob-bied for allocation of resources to thejail, resulting in the hiring of two addi-tional staff for the jail's STD program. There also can be valuable teaching opportunities on these planninggroups. The Florida Department ofCorrections' infection control coordi-nator is a member of the statewidePrevention Planning Group, where shebelieves her most important functionhas been to educate the other membersabout the correctional environmentand the needs of inmate populations. On the other hand, the absence of cor- rectional representation on HIV Pre-vention Planning Groups, which is thecase in most of the jurisdictions visitedfor this study, almost inevitably meansthat programs in correctional facilitiesreceive insufficient attention and sup-port. In turn, a critical impetus for col-laborative programs will be missing. Joint committees. Service on other stand- ing committees provides opportunities to develop and enhance collaborations. In Il-linois and New York, the public health andcorrectional departments are both repre-sented on State interagency AIDS taskforces, while in Missouri, Washington, andNew York, both departments serve on Governors' advisory councils on AIDS.New York's advisory council has a sub-committee on criminal justice that in-cludes representatives of State corrections,health, and parole agencies. In Missouri,the health department's medical directorserves on the department of correction's(DOC's) review committee for its healthservices contract. The Florida DOC's medical director serves on the State TB Control Coalitionand the department of health's (DOH's)medical director for HIV sits on thecorrectional department's medical eth-ics panel. A task force comprising stafffrom the jail, corrections center, andhealth department was convened inMemphis to address TB screening injails. It has been proposed to keep thisgroup in existence to provide a forumfor discussion of other health issues inthe jails and correctional center. InRochester, a Jail Health Advisory Com-mittee has brought together high-levelmanagers at the jail and in the healthdepartment to address issues of com-mon concern. Regularly held meetings. In addition to serving together on standing commit-tees, it is important for public health andcorrectional staff to conduct regularly held meetings at both leadership and op-erational levels . In Florida, there are quarterly coordination meetings of DOCand DOH staff on TB issues, TB case-review conferences. TB case-re-view meetings are also held in Missourion a monthly basis. These meetings haveidentified errors, one involving a case in which treatment was wrongly terminated. In contrast, a barrier to collaboration may have been the absence or infre-quency of meetings at central officeand facility levels. In one jurisdiction,13R e s e a r c h i n B r i e f the lack of meetings between the heads and high-level management of relevantdepartments has led to a somewhatfragmented approach to the provision ofpublic health interventions in the jails.The jurisdiction's approach has beencharacterized by overlapping functions,poor communication, and turf disputes. Sharing information. Access to and exchange of information about indi-vidual patients is often critical to the success of collaborative efforts. This isparticularly true when correctional orhealth department staff providefollowup on test results or partner noti-fication or continue patients on medica-tions following their transfer or release.(Inmates may be transferred frequentlyfrom housing unit to housing unit withina facility as well as between differentfacilities. Inmates may also be releasedon short notice.) In many of the visited jurisdictions, procedures have been developed totransfer medical records and provideinteragency access to important clini-cal or locator information. In NewYork State, for example, health depart-ment staff have access to portions ofthe department of correctional services(DOCS) inmate information system sothey can track transferred inmateswithin the system and ensure that HIVand PPD results and medication statusare provided to the new facility. In Illi-nois, the health department was ableto track and respond appropriately to aTB outbreak in the correctional systembecause their staff had access to theDOC database on inmate movementsand transfers. The work of Missourihealth department staff who conductfollowup interviews in the prisons andelicit information about sexual part-ners is facilitated by access to thecorrectional department's HIV andsyphilis case logs and to inmates' auto- mated medical records. Similarly,Chicago health department staff whoconduct STD screening and treatmentin Cook County jail depend on thejail's database for the locations andcourt dates of inmates and on theChicago health department registry fortheir treatment histories. Under a grant from the Corrections Program Office, U.S. Department ofJustice, Florida's prison and jail leader-ship is developing a partnership in TBcontrol with the primary objectives ofcoordination of services and exchangeof information as inmates move fromcounty jails to State prisons. Correctional department access to health department databases can alsobe very useful. In Washington State,when the DOC wishes to determine thestatus of inmates being transferred orreleased, it can check health depart-ment databases on patients receivingmedications for TB and patients receiv-ing preventive therapy. On the other hand, problems with the availability and exchange of informationhave impeded collaboration and under-mined inmate health care. In many in-stances, vital medical records, includingtest results and medication status oftransferred or released inmates, werenever sent to the new health care pro-vider or sent only after long delays. HIVantibody tests and PPD skin tests havehad to be readministered because therewas no record of previous testing. At onejuvenile detention facility, the countyhealth department was responsible forHIV counseling and testing but did notfurnish test results to the facility's medi-cal director. Inmates receiving com bina- tion antiretroviral therapy for HIV mayarrive at a new facility without writtenrecords of the specific regimen, and the new facility may be unable to obtainrecords from the previous facility withina reasonable period. Therefore, medica-tions may need to be restarted. Suggestions on how public health de- partments and correctional agenciescan work together to expand and en-hance health services for inmates areoffered under \"Policy Implications.\" Conclusions Collaborative efforts should be expandedto include organizations beyond public health and adult correctional agenciesand to involve a broader range of criminal justice populations and organizations thatoffer needed services and linkages. Othertypes of organizations to include in com-prehensive collaborations are probationand parole agencies, juvenile systems andfacilities, community-based organizations,AIDS service organizations, substanceabuse treatment programs, academicmedical centers and universities, andother service providers. Clearly, State and local government agencies and service providers in theaffected communities bear the primaryresponsibility for development of col-laborations. However, Federal agenciessuch as CDC and NIJ may be able tosupport expanded and enhanced col-laborations in some ways. These in-clude funding demonstration projects(such as CDC's enhanced STD screen-ing and treatment efforts) and sponsor-ing conferences and forums that offeropportunities for staff of correctionaland public health departments andother pertinent organizations to meetand discuss collaborations. The development and distribution by appropriate government agencies of14R e s e a r c h i n B r i e f Policy ImplicationsT his study identified many effective and promising public health/corrections col-laborations to address problems of HIV/AIDS,STDs, and TB in correctional facilities, as wellas gaps, shortfalls, and weaknesses in col-laborative efforts. In general, the study foundthat inmate services and collaborations in thefollowing areas could benefit from expansionand enhancement: Behavioral prevention programs. Inmate peer-based programs. Discharge planning and transitional ser- vices, including continuity of care, adherenceto medication regimens, and social services toease the transition to the community. The study also found that most current col- laborations involve public health departmentsproviding or funding services in correctionalfacilities. This is, to be sure, an important as-pect of collaboration that requires grantingaccess to the facility as well as some inter-change and discussion between public healthand correctional agencies. But several actions are required to achieve comprehensive rela-tionships: Collec ting and disseminating data by public health departments to demon-strate the disease burden in correctionaland criminal justice populations. Without these data, it may be very difficult to convincedecisionmakers of the need for more re-sources and expanded collaborations. Including correctional representatives on HIV Prevention Planning Groups.Such representation can help to ensure thatcorrectional and criminal justice settings re-ceive their fair share of attention and thattheir unmet resource needs receive appropri-ate priority.Initiating or expanding funding by public health departments of services andstaff in correctional facilities and othercriminal justice settings. Such funding support can be the first step in the development of fullcollaborations. Recognizing the importance of inter- ventions in correctional settings to thehealth of the larger community. In particu- lar, the importance of screening, early detec-tion, and early treatment can be understoodand reflected in program priorities. Additional steps to consider Additional, more specific steps may be takento help ensure successful collaboration: Improving the context for collaboration. Use administrative, legislative, and regulatorypowers to require collaborations: Include specific roles and requirements for health departments and correctional agencies forcollaborative efforts in appropriate legislation andregulations. Formalize collaborative relationships between health departments and correctional agencies inmemorandums of understanding or other writ-ten agreements. Establish and use the legal powers of health directors to require disease screening and otherinterventions as appropriate and ethical. Building collaborative attitudes. Promote the following attitudes and philosophies thatfacilitate collaboration: Establish a commitment by h ealth depart- ments and correctional agencies to the principlethat public health is part of public safety. Recognize that correctional facilities are part of the community. Additionally, virtuallyall inmates return to the community. Open correctional facilities to outside organi- zations that can provide valuable resources andexpertise to address health issues. Build mutual respect for each others' mis- sions, priorities, concerns, and capabilities. Forexample, address the legitimate concerns ofcorrectional employees regarding occupationalexposure to HIV, STDs, TB, and other diseases. Be willing to compromise and work within the reasonable rules and constraints of the cor-rectional facility in order to achieve larger public health goals. Operationalizing collaboration. Establish the following operational features to fostercollaboration: Locate health department programs and staff in correctional facilities. Establish single, regularly accessible liai- sons for collaboration at the central officeand facility levels. Resolve logistical issues by, for example, providing trouble-free gate clearance forhealth department program staff and expedit-ing callout and escorts for inmates attendinghealth programs. Improving c ommunication. Improve com- munication and information exchange among allstaff members in the following ways: Develop and implement better systems for accessing and exchanging important clinicaland inmate-locator information at all jurisdic-tional levels. Establish joint health department/correc- tional committees at the leadership and opera-tional levels. Hold regular joint staff meetings at the cen- tral office and facility levels.15R e s e a r c h i n B r i e f guidelines for the prevention of HIV/ AIDS and STDs in correctional settingsmight be helpful in fostering collabora-tions between public health and correc-tional agencies. Guidelines such asthose developed by CDC for controllingTB in correctional facilities could pro-vide a framework for discussion of thebenefits of appropriate prevention, con-trol, and treatment procedures. In sum, correctional facilities are im- portant points to access high-risk,underserved populations and offer op-portunities to reach these populationswith important health interventions.As the examples included in this re-port demonstrate, collaborative effortscan be successful in improving thehealth of inmates and benefiting over-all public health as well.
