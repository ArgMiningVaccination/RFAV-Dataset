[Vitamin C](https://www.today.com/health/5-easy-ways-get-more-vitamin-c-boost-your-immunity-t192500) is a powerful ingredient that not only protects your body from environmental aggressors and boosts your immune system (hello, [flu season](https://www.today.com/health/immune-boosters-t116429)), but it can also have an incredibly beneficial impact on the health of your skin. What does vitamin C serum do for my skin? Collagen production naturally peaks in your early 20s and then decreases every decade thereafter; that's why it's essential to add vitamin C to your anti-aging skin care routine. It's a potent antioxidant that can help your body neutralize harmful free radicals and prevent the breakdown of collagen as much as possible. Vitamin C also inhibits melanin production, which will help even out sun spots and hyperpigmentation for a more even-toned complexion. Dr. Corey L. Hartman, Founder, Skin Wellness Dermatology \"When applied topically, vitamin C reduces damage to our cells by neutralizing [free radicals](https://www.today.com/style/what-are-free-radicals-how-do-they-affect-your-skin-t150296) \u2014 which are highly reactive \u2014 and harmful molecules formed by exposure to environmental stressors (think pollution, [UV light](https://www.today.com/shop/sun-uv-protection-products-hair-t221761), etc.),\" explains [Dr. Corey L. Hartman](https://skinwellness.com/about/), a board-certified dermatologist and the founder of Skin Wellness Dermatology in Birmingham, Alabama. Excessive exposure to free radicals can degrade [collagen](https://www.today.com/shop/best-collagen-creams-t217750), which can lead to dull, saggy skin, according to the derm. [Dr. Joshua Zeichner](https://www.mountsinai.org/profiles/joshua-zeichner), Director of Clinical and Cosmetic Research in Dermatology at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York City, echoes this, adding that vitamin C is the best-studied antioxidant we have to treat the skin. In addition to the neutralization of free radicals, Zeichner says vitamin C serves two other main functions: \"Second, it blocks the production of abnormal pigmentation to help lighten dark spots and even skin tone. Third, it is an essential co-factor in the production of healthy collagen,\" Zeichner explains. Ready to learn more?

[What if I have sensitive skin?](https://www.today.com/shop/best-vitamin-c-serums-t213237#anchor-CanIusevitaminCserumsifIhavesensitiveskin) | [What to look for](https://www.today.com/shop/best-vitamin-c-serums-t213237#anchor-WhattolookforinavitaminCserum) | [How FAQs](https://www.today.com/shop/best-vitamin-c-serums-t213237#anchor-QuestionsaboutvitaminCserumsansweredbyexperts) [Meet our experts](https://www.today.com/shop/best-vitamin-c-serums-t213237#anchor-Meetourexperts) Can I use vitamin C serums if I have sensitive skin? The good news: Yes, you can use vitamin C serums if you have sensitive skin. \" [L-ascorbic acid](https://www.today.com/style/what-are-acids-do-you-need-them-your-skin-care-t150357#anchor-Lascorbicacid) is pure vitamin C, which is the most potent and refined version of vitamin C,\" explains Hartman. \"Skin care products with higher concentrations of L-ascorbic acid tend to be higher in price and may not be suitable for people with sensitive skin or for someone who has never tried vitamin C before,\" he adds. If you have sensitive skin, look for skin care products that use [magnesium ascorbyl phosphate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/magnesium-ascorbyl-phosphate), a water-soluble and less potent version of vitamin C \u2014 meaning it will be less irritating on the skin. \"It's also a good idea to do a patch test if you have sensitive skin or haven't used vitamin C before,\" suggests Hartman. \"Put a small drop of your vitamin C serum on the skin on the underside of your wrist. Let it sit there for 24 hours, and if you do not experience any kind of irritation, slowly start to incorporate the product into your skin care routine,\" he explains. What to look for in a vitamin C serum - Percentage. When on the hunt for a great vitamin C serum for your skin, you first want to look at the percentage of the ingredient in the product. \"The sweet spot tends to be between 10 to 20 percent \u2014anything below 10 percent won't be as effective, and anything over 20 percent would be too irritating to the skin,\" explains Hartman. - Other ingredients that pair well. Vitamin C pairs well with other popular skin care ingredients. Hartman recommends looking for vitamin C products with complementary active ingredients to get the most bang for your buck. These include [caffeine](https://www.today.com/shop/caffeine-beauty-products-t218239), vitamin E, ferulic acid and [hyaluronic acid](https://www.today.com/shop/best-hyaluronic-acid-serum-moisturizer-t229068). \"Vitamin C does not pair well with retinol or AHAs,\" explains Dr. Hartman. \"Most people will use a vitamin C serum in their morning routine, so leave the [retinol](https://www.today.com/shop/best-retinol-serums-t260492)and [AHAs](https://www.today.com/shop/glycolic-acid-deodorant-t224506)for your evening skincare routine.\" - Proper packaging. Pure vitamin C (aka L-ascorbic acid) is the least stable form of vitamin C and can lose its effectiveness if exposed to light and air. \"A dark or tinted bottle is best to reduce light and airless delivery; a pump is ideal,\" explains Hartman. \"If you choose a vitamin C serum with a dropper delivery system, just make sure you tightly secure the bottle after use each day to prolong its effectiveness.\" How we chose the best vitamin C serums There are so many vitamin C products on the market, and it's difficult to discern which are actually effective and which are worth the money.
