Whey, a protein found in milk, is one of the most popular types of protein powder, but there are also plant-based protein powders derived from various foods, like soy, hemp, pea, nuts, and rice. Some organic protein powders also have additional nutrients, like vitamins, minerals, fats, and probiotics. It's possible to meet all your protein needs through food alone, but those who exercise regularly, consume a plant-based diet, or don't eat enough protein on a daily basis may find protein powders helpful and convenient. Organic protein powders vary in their composition depending on the product, and they are not inherently superior nutritionally compared to conventional protein powders. However, consuming organic products reduces your exposure to synthetic fertilizers, herbicides, and pesticides. In terms of the environmental impacts of organic versus conventional protein powders, organic agriculture cultivates better soil quality and is better for biodiversity. When choosing a protein powder, Angie Asche MS, RD, CSSD author of \"Fuel Your Body: How to Cook & Eat for Peak Performance,\" recommends looking for a minimal ingredient list, around 20 grams of protein, and additional third-party testing labels, like NSF Certified for Sport or Informed-Choice for Sport Certified. Third-party testing ensures the product contains what it says on the label without unsafe levels of contaminants. To determine the best organic protein powders on the market, our registered dietitians reviewed research and used their clinical expertise, evaluating for quality and nutritional content. We also tested 25 protein powders and rated each product for taste, texture, smell, third-party testing, nutrition, and value. Editor's Note Our team of registered dietitians reviews and evaluates every single supplement we recommend according to our dietary supplement methodology. From there, a registered dietitian on our Expert Review Board reviews each article for scientific accuracy. Always speak with a healthcare professional before adding a supplement to your routine to ensure that the supplement is appropriate for your individual needs, and to find out what dosage to take.

It's also sustainably sourced\u2014the whey comes from milk produced by grass-fed cows on sustainable Irish farms. According to the Garden of Life website, this method of dairy products produces half the average global environmental footprint. Its third-party label credentials ensure the powder does not contain any substances that are banned from sport. One serving delivers 24 grams of protein from a combination of whey protein isolate and milk protein. There is an abundance of research on the benefits of whey as a protein source for muscle protein synthesis. In addition, the milk protein provides beneficial immunoglobulins\u2014antibodies that produce an immune response in the body. Garden of Life SPORT Certified Grass Fed Whey delivers all the essential amino acids, with 6 grams of branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) and 4 grams of glutamine, both of which aid in muscle recovery and repair. In addition, the two billion colony-forming units (CFUs) of the probiotic B.lactis BL-04 may support immune health.

The milk used to create the powder is free of synthetic growth hormones (rBGH), antibiotics, and pesticides. \"Whey protein is highly bioavailable and easily digested, making it an ideal choice in the post-workout time frame,\" says Carroll. Whey protein also contains all the BCAAs, and Carroll notes that it's a particularly good source of the amino acid leucine, which plays a role in recovery after exercise. There are different types of whey to look out for on product packaging. Whey concentrate is 25 to 89 percent protein and has some lactose and fat. In comparison, whey isolate is made up of at least 90 percent protein, with less lactose and fat. \"This powder's only ingredient is organic whey protein concentrate (concentrated from organic milk), with no flavors, sweeteners, or additional added ingredients\u2014making it a great product to mix into smoothies or add to baked goods,\" says Carroll. Asche also notes that it contains the NSF Certified for Sport label, meaning that athletes routinely drug-tested can feel extra safe using this product.

Like the other whey protein powders on our list, this product is a highly bioavailable protein source with all essential amino acids and BCAAs. It's a great option for athletes, as well as anyone looking to incorporate a convenient, quality protein into their diet. We like that the unflavored version is versatile, but we recommend mixing it into smoothies to get the best texture and taste. Mixed with just plain water, it does not fully dissolve, leaving a grainy texture and some clumps, and we also noticed a slight aftertaste. In addition to the unflavored option, they also have vanilla and chocolate flavors.

Amino acids are what make up proteins, and some amino acids are limited in certain plant-based proteins. For example, lysine is present in very small amounts in grains, and methionine and cysteine are low in legumes. That's why Carroll recommends plant-based proteins that come from a variety of food sources. This organic plant-based protein powder has 21 grams of vegan protein, no added sugar, and no artificial sweeteners. The flavored variety is sweetened with stevia and erythritol, but you can also select a plain unsweetened flavor if you prefer.

Made from a blend of organic pea protein, organic sprouted navy bean, organic sprouted lentil bean, organic sprouted garbanzo bean, and organic cranberry protein, one serving has 30 grams of protein. It also includes an organic recovery blend with multiple antioxidant sources, such as organic tart cherries, organic apples, organic turmeric, organic goji berries, and organic blueberries. Antioxidants help prevent the inflammation associated with exercise, which may aid in recovery. Lastly, this protein powder contains probiotics that may support immune health.

All of these ingredients combined make up 20 grams of plant-based protein, 25 percent of the daily value (DV) of vitamin K, and 25 percent DV of iron. Vega Protein & Greens is sweetened with zero-calorie stevia and has no added sugar. Some people prefer products sweetened with zero-calorie sweeteners, and others note that they do not like their flavor. Others may find these sweeteners, which have a more intense sweetness compared to sugar, increase their preference for very sweet things and may not ultimately be beneficial.

We recommend trying to meet your daily protein requirements through foods such as chicken, fish, meat, dairy, soy, beans, legumes, nuts, and seeds. The average person needs 0.8 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight (0.36 grams per pound) per day. With a well-balanced diet, most people consume plenty of protein and do not need protein powders. Splitting protein intake among meals and snacks is an easy approach to taking in enough protein. That said, protein powder in general may be beneficial for the following people, and, if consuming organic foods is important to you, you may want to specifically choose an organic protein powder: Athletes or very active individuals: According to Chrissy Carroll, MPH, RD, LDN, ACSM-cPT, USAT Level I Triathlon Coach, and RRCA Certified Running Coach, protein powders can be useful for active individuals, particularly in the post-workout time frame. \"Protein plays a role in muscle repair and recovery, and folks undergoing intense workouts or two-a-day workouts may benefit from eating something with protein (and carbohydrate) after their sweat session,\" says Carroll. Those with dietary restrictions, such as vegans or vegetarians: \"[Protein powders] can absolutely be beneficial for people who struggle to meet protein needs daily through food sources alone,\" says Asche. Those on a plant-based diet with limited protein options may find protein powders a quick and convenient way to take in protein. Those trying to lose weight for health reasons: Carroll notes that a higher protein intake may be beneficial for people trying to lose weight. \"If an individual is struggling to achieve a higher protein intake through food alone, protein powders can be a good adjunct strategy alongside a balanced diet,\" says Carroll. However, those with kidney issues should avoid a very high protein diet and discuss it with a registered dietitian before adding in a protein powder. With that being said, focusing on weight loss might not work long-term, and many of our dietitians recommend focusing on changing health behaviors rather than fixating on the number on the scale. What Shopping Organic Means For You Who May Not Benefit from Organic Protein Powders Organic protein powders are not necessary for those who are comfortable using standard protein powder. Protein powders in general are not beneficial for the following people: Those who are already meeting or exceeding their protein needs. \"Many adults (including casual gym-goers) get enough protein in their diet, and adding extra protein through a powder can be expensive and unnecessary,\" says Carroll. \"When people start relying on protein shakes for meals instead of whole foods, they may miss out on key nutrients and phytochemicals,\" she adds. Young athletes. \"While not necessarily bad, I also personally don't recommend them to youth athletes,\" says Asche. She encourages younger athletes to get their nutrients through whole food sources rather than relying on supplements. Verywell Fit / Tamara Staples How We Select and Test Supplements Our team works hard to be transparent about why we recommend certain supplements; you can read more about our dietary supplement methodology here. We also consulted with Angie Asche MS, RD, CSSD author of \"Fuel Your Body: How to Cook & Eat for Peak Performance,\" and Chrissy Carroll, MPH, RD, LDN, ACSM-cPT, USAT Level I Triathlon Coach, and RRCA Certified Running Coach. We support supplements that are evidence-based and rooted in science. We value certain product attributes that we find to be associated with the highest quality products. It's important to note that the FDA does not review dietary supplements for safety and effectiveness before they go to market. Our team of experts has created a detailed, science-backed methodology to choose the supplements we recommend. In addition to our research, we tested 25 of the top protein powders in the Verywell Testing Lab to rate each product for taste, texture, smell, and value. We tested the products by mixing a serving of each powder into cold water in a shaker bottle, noting how long it took to dissolve (and if it dissolved completely), and then tasted the product evaluating flavor, texture and smell. We then combined these ratings with a nutrition and third-party testing score from our nutrition editor to get an overall rating for each pick. We Also Tested While not a top pick for any category, we also tested these organic protein powders and think they are still worth highlighting. Sunwarrior Classic Protein Powder: We like that this organic protein powder contains 20 grams of protein from fermented brown rice, and that it is third-party tested for heavy metals and other potential contaminants. We tested the chocolate flavor, which has a strong artificial sweetness and aftertaste from the stevia. This powder does dissolve well in water, creating a thick and creamy texture without clumps that is smooth to drink. Ora Organic So Lean & So Clean: This protein powder contains a plant-based protein blend, with 21 grams of protein per serving. We like that this product is third-party tested for purity and potency, with a Certificate of Analysis (COA) available for each batch. We love the taste of the vanilla chai flavor, which contains natural flavorings, as well as stevia and monk fruit for sweetness. It dissolves well with water in a shaker bottle, but it would also be a great choice to mix with a milk base of your choice. We chose not to include this product on our list because of the digestive enzyme blend it contains, which does not have sufficient scientific backing for regular use, and may not be suitable for all. Verywell Fit / Jhett Thompson What to Look for in an Organic Protein Powder Third-Party Testing Supplements that are third-party tested are sent to a lab where they are tested to ensure they contain what they say they contain and are not contaminated with specific high-risk, common contaminants. However, it's important to note: Third-party testing does not test to see if a product is effective or safe for everyone, and it does not ensure the supplement will not interact with other supplements or medications. Not all third-party testing is created equal. It is not uncommon for supplement companies to pay labs for certificates after conducting minimal to no testing. The third-party certifications we can trust are: ConsumerLab.com, NSF, and USP. However, these certifications are difficult to obtain and/or expensive for manufacturers, so many companies choose not to get their products tested by one of these three organizations. Sometimes products tested by these three companies are more expensive to try to offset the cost they pay for certification. Just because a supplement is not tested by one of these three companies does not mean it's a bad product. We recommend doing some research on the reputability of the manufacturer and calling up the manufacturer and their testing lab to determine their protocols and decide if you feel comfortable consuming the supplement. Many people are concerned about protein powder and heavy metal contamination, but this is only a risk if the heavy metal levels exceed certain levels. In fact, tons of foods have some levels of heavy metals, especially those grown in soil. But there is little risk to human health from the heavy metals found in protein powders since the levels are very low. Therefore, third-party testing isn't especially important for protein powders. Form Protein powders come in powder form, which can be mixed into a liquid of your choice. The most popular protein sources for organic protein powders include whey, soy, and pea. Many new plant-based protein sources are being produced from nuts, seeds, beans, and legumes. Ingredients & Potential Interactions It is essential to carefully read the ingredient list and nutrition facts panel of a supplement to know which ingredients and how much of each ingredient is included relative to the recommended daily value of that ingredient. Please bring the supplement label to a healthcare provider to review the different ingredients contained in the supplement and any potential interactions between these ingredients and other supplements and medications you are taking. Some organic protein powders include other ingredients, like vitamins, minerals, probiotics, digestive enzymes, and BCAAs. If you are taking any additional supplements, check with your doctor to make sure you are not consuming a large harmful dose. Whey protein may reduce the absorption of certain drugs, like Albenza, Fosamex, and certain antibiotics. If you are taking these medications, check with your doctor before starting a protein powder regimen. Some people complain of gas or bloating after consuming a protein powder. If you are lactose intolerant or have a milk allergy, avoid whey protein and opt for plant-based protein powders. Organic Protein Powder Dosage The Recommended Daily Allowance (RDA) for protein is 0.8 grams per kilogram (0.36 grams per pound) of body weight per day. However, research indicates that athletes engaging in intense training may benefit from ingesting anywhere from 1.2 to 2.0 grams of protein per kilogram (0.45 to 0.9 grams per pound) of body weight per day to maintain muscle mass. Although each athlete is different, higher intakes are generally recommended for shorter periods of intense training. A recent review found that most athletes benefit from a protein intake of around 1.6 grams per kilogram (0.72 grams per pound) per day. It is of the utmost importance to make sure you take in enough calories, particularly carbohydrates, to make up for how much energy you are using. If an athlete burns more calories than they consume, their body will start to break down lean muscle for use as fuel. Over time, this may lead to muscle wasting, injuries, illness, and training issues. Most protein powders have at least 20 grams of protein per serving. Consider your own protein needs before choosing a protein powder. How Much Is Too Much? There is no set upper limit for protein intake. Some research indicates that healthy adults can consume as much as 2.0 to 3.5 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight without any negative side effects. However, those who consume excessive amounts of protein for a long period of time may experience digestive, renal, and vascular issues. Frequently Asked Questions How do I use organic protein powder? Carroll suggests adding organic protein powder to smoothies or baked goods. It also mixes well into oatmeal, overnight oats, chia seed pudding, homemade energy bites, and more. Each company provides suggestions for use and recipes on its website. Is organic protein powder better than non-organic? There is no nutritional advantage to choosing organic protein powder over non-organic. The ingredients in an organic protein powder must be certified organic. According to the USDA, organic foods are grown on soil that has no prohibited substances, such as synthetic fertilizers and pesticides, for at least three years prior to harvest. In addition, organic protein powders cannot contain artificial preservatives, colors, or flavors. Will organic protein powder help me lose weight? \"For some people, protein powders may also be helpful during efforts to lose weight,\" says Carroll. \"A recent review concluded that higher protein intake may be beneficial in preserving lean muscle mass during periods of weight loss, particularly when combined with resistance training.\" That said, weight loss also requires a well-balanced, healthy diet, exercise, and adequate sleep. Consuming protein powder is not necessary for weight loss, but it may be beneficial. Keep in mind that most people who diet to lose weight regain the weight they lost over time. Therefore, it may be beneficial to shift your focus away from weight and toward health, focusing instead on eating and exercising to support feeling better, getting stronger, improving sleep, reducing stress, and increasing your energy levels. Does organic protein powder help you build muscle? While protein intake is linked to muscle protein synthesis, organic protein powder is not necessary to build muscle. One of the criticisms of protein powder is taking in a high dosage of protein all at once is not necessary.Research suggests that ingesting 0.4 grams of protein per kilogram (0.18 grams per pound) of body weight at each meal may optimally stimulate muscle growth. For a 150-pound individual, that equates to 27 grams of protein or the amount of protein in 4 ounces of chicken (about the size of a deck of cards) or 9 ounces of tofu ( of a block) per meal.In addition, evidence suggests a daily total intake of 1.6 grams of protein per kilogram (0.72 grams per pound) of body weight leads to muscle gains in resistance-trained athletes. This means that as long as you eat a good source of protein in three or four meals per day, there is typically no need to supplement with protein powder.If you struggle to get in a good source of protein at a particular meal, that meal might be a great time to use protein powder. If consumption of protein powder falls within these ranges, it may promote muscle growth. Does organic protein powder expire? Organic protein powders are low in moisture and are not likely to spoil or grow harmful bacteria or microorganisms. Therefore, most do not have an expiration date. Instead, a protein powder may showcase a \"use by\" date, which indicates how long the product will be of acceptable quality. A \"sell by\" date indicates how long the product should sit on store shelves.
