Can we develop new methods that explicitly account for multiple infecting strains? Shoehorn: Within Cluster Resampling aka Multiple Outputation 1) Randomly pick a single pathogen for each infected person -Fred 4 unique strains: 1 match 3 mismatch -Pick a strain at random e.g. mismatch 2) Run a standard sieve analysis -VE(match) = .65 VE(mismatch) = .51 3)Repeat many many many times and average.Within 63.1 53.9 There is an easy way to get a p -value for within cluster resampling.Easy Inference With WCR Each resample Vi -Sample variance of the Pi S2 2is normal on the nullEasy Inference With WCR Each resample gives Vi -Sample variance of the Pi S2 2is standard normal on the nullWCR WCR can be used whenever you have a statistical procedure Pthat requires 1 outcome per person, but you have multiple outcomes.

RTS,S vaccine targets circumsporozoite protein & has partial efficacy. GSK conducted a phase III trial in 11 sites across 7 African countries in 8922 children randomized 2:1 V:P , N=8922. Does vaccine show sieve effect?Malaria Conclusions Different methods WCR WEE- I WEE- M estimate different things -all useful If only power matters. -WEE -I more significant than WEE -M than X1,X2 -WEE -I more significant than WCR Later simulations show this is generally true, WEE -I bigger estimand with smaller variance than WCRSummary New technology allows us to count the number of clonally unique infecting pathogens Leads to a new vaccine metric, reduction in the mean number of infecting pathogens Can be used for overall VE and for strain-specific VE.Poliomyleitis caused by poliovirus Poliomyleitis is a viral disease that can infect the central nervous system and cause lasting disabilities in a small number of infected individuals. Polio infection is most common in children but adults are at risk too -Franklin Roosevelt developed polio Polio was greatly feared. -Outbreaks are unpredictable -Paralyzed children are a visual reminder National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis was formed in 1938 to develop a vaccine. Key developments Virus was isolated in infected subjects 1908 Identification of three serotypes of polovirus , each serotype has a distinctive surface and a specific antibody works against a specific type. Confirmation that neutralizing (blocking) antibodies protect against disease -At risk children who received antibodies from polio survivors saw 80% reduction in paralytic poliomyelitis compared to children with gelatin Growth of virus in cell culture -Allows production of vaccine \u2014germ bits Vaccine developments Inactivated polio vaccine (IPV): -Three serotypes grown in cell culture and then killed by formalin -Developed by Jonas Salk, injected -Can't cause disease Oral polio vaccine (OPV): -Three serotypes were weakened by repeated passage in cold non- human cells -Replicates in the gut. Very rarely causes disease or mutates to a more virulent form -Developed by Sabin, swallowed1954 Polio Field Trial of Salk Vaccine Salk Vaccine was promising but unproven. A field trial was essential. Earlier killed vaccines had some unkilled virus that lead to disease Intense publicity about the vaccine. Trial needed to be done in a single season Rate of paralytic polio by region was highly variable. Key Features of Trial Two studies -Blinded placebo controlled individually randomized study in 84 areas in 11 states. Children in grades 1- 3 randomized. -Observational trial 127 areas in 33 states. Children in grade 2 vaccinated grades 1 and 3 received nothing. Helped public support Conducted in spring and summer of 1954 -Enrollment took long ---vaccinations into mid June -Antibodies measured 1-16/55 = .71 Vaccine efficacyAfter the 1954 Field Trial Cutter incident of Salks inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) -One manufacturer didn't properly virus -260 cases were caused: 94 vaccinees , 126 family, 40 community Sabin's oral attenuated vaccine (OPV) worked well in Soviet Union -Licensed in US 1960 -Widely used in US 1961 -89, simpler & worked better than IPV but -Causes paralysis in 1 of 2.9 million vaccinations By 2000 US had switched from OPV to IPV Global Polio Eradication Campaign started in 1988, WHO UNICEF & Rotary Foundation, now supported by BMGF & Hutch. Afghanistan & Pakistan two remaining countries with endemic polio -Challenge: vaccination is a western plot to sterilize -Challenge: sham Hep B vaccination campaign used to confirm Osama bin Laden's identity Oral polio vaccine (OPV) is highly effective but causes some polio making eradication difficult. Plan is to switch from OPV to killed (inactivated) IPV with last wild polio case Acknowledgements Betz Halloran, Peter Gilbert, Michael Sachs, "}
