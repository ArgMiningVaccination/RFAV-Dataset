Our board members volunteer their time to guide the NSBN through the regulation of nurses. The Board currently consists of four RNs, one LPN, one CNA, and one member of the public who is not a nurse. Our current composition does not require an APRN representative. Given that there are over 2,000 APRNs in Nevada, the representation of APRNs is important. The NSBN will pursue a statutory change during the 2021 Legislative session to require the addition of an APRN member. Many would say serving on the NSBN Board is an honor. Board members adhere to expectations intended to assure public protection and uphold the highest level of integrity and ethical standards. This is an opportunity to be actively involved in nursing practice and education through effective policymaking decisions. Board members receive orientations from the NSBN and the Attorney General office. Their responsibilities extend beyond hearings and board meetings. They have an overall responsibility to ensure the NSBN is functioning within the guidelines established through the Governor's office. This includes understanding how boards work, parliamentary order, and personal responsibilities as a board member. Annually, the Board reviews and revises the strategic plan, which guides the regulation of nursing practice in Nevada. Strategic plan progress is reported every board meeting to ensure we are meeting the standards we set for ourselves. In 2010, the Institute of Medicine released a report titled the Future of Nursing: Leading Change, Advancing Health. The report suggests nurses need to be included on boards and in other key leadership positions to provide their unique contributions and perspectives regarding healthcare delivery. I mention this because the Board's work is not easy and often goes unnoticed. Board members serve four-year terms. During their term, members commit to upholding the mission of the NSBN. The responsibility of the Board is often challenging. Each meeting is different and requires time and focus to review the pre-determined agenda. Board members are conscientious about each item before them. Discussions and ultimate decisions are rendered after careful consideration. If you are interested in being on our Board, you can apply via the Governor's website (gov.nv.gov) by selecting the boards option at the top. Cathy Dinauer, MSN, RN, FRE 5MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT Mary-Ann Brown, RN, MSN CHPCA GCHCE HEC-C If you have not had a chance to visits the Nevada State Board of Nursing (NSBN) updated website (https://nevadanursingboard.org/) you should check it out. The site covers numerous topics and provides excellent information. You can find out about obtaining or renewing a nursing licensure or certification, setting up a finger print appointment, or filing a complaint and there is so much more. The Board's quarterly magazine is available. You can access reports that provide an overview of the size, scope and actions of the NSBN, the NSBN Annual Report and the NSBN CORE report. The FY2018 NSBN CORE Report contains information on Discipline, Practice, Licensure, Education and Board Interactions. CORE stands for Commitment to Ongoing Regulatory Excellence and is a comparative performance measuring and benchmarking process for state boards of nursing (BONs). CORE was developed in 1998 and uses surveys from BONs and stakeholders to track the effectiveness and efficiency of nursing regulation nationally. CORE also allows an individual state BON to review their performance for opportunities for improvement. A few interesting data points contained in the report include: The average number of applications for nursing licensure renewal in Nevada in FY2018 was 17,862 an increase of 2,715 from FY 2014. How satisfied are nurses with the license renewal process? In FY2018, 88.3 % responded excellent or good with only 8.3% selecting fair and 3.3% noting poor. Nevada has continued to increase the percentage of discipline cases resolved within 6 months from 75% in 2014 to 81% in FY 2018. In FY 2018 the average for all Boards was 61%. The average number of nurses with an initial discipline per 1,000 nurses in FY2018 in Nevada was 1.86 and for all boards was 2.53. The average number of denials for licensure was 2 for Nevada and 6.20 for all Boards. The average pass rates for first time NCLEX-RN applicants in FY 2018 was 91%. NSBN uses the CORE report to identify areas for improvement, and to that end, the 2020 CORE report should let us know our progress on improvements and identify areas that need attention. For more data and comparisons, check out the report. The next CORE report will be released in 2020, presented to the NSBN, and published on the website following review and approval by the NSBN.

VanBeuge, DNP, APRN, FNP-BC, FAANP In this international year of the nurse and midwife, you've likely seen celebration in many places nurses practice. This year is not chosen by happenstance, but marks the 200th anniversary of the birth of Florence Nightingale. Known as being \"the lady with the lamp\" she is attributed with championing sanitary conditions, while improving positive patient outcomes. Ms. Nightingale was born to a wealthy family and being in service was not what her father had in mind for her life. Rather, she spent her life ministering to the poor, ill and less fortunate. When she told her parents her intentions to attend nursing school, this was met with little enthusiasm. The young Florence was strong willed and determined. In her career, she was a patient champion in many ways. This set the stage for what is the underlying philosophy of nursing today. As nurses, we are patient advocates and champions for well- being. Our call today is not unlike what Nightingale experienced in her early career: tend to those who need care. Thanks to early actions of Florence Nightingale, nursing is seen as an honorable profession. We enjoy this today as nurses. Nurses routinely are voted as the most trusted profession year after year. This honor does not come without hard work, dedication, and persistence. This year of the nurse and midwife is more than just an acknowledgment of the nursing profession, but a call to action for all nurses around the world. We face many challenges in the world: hunger, poverty and poor access to care as well as shortages of nurses. In the face of such limits, nurses can carry the lamp that once lite the dark halls of the hospital in Crimea and champion for health care today. What will be our call to action for the next 200 hundred years in nursing? Solving health care access in our own communities, or creating systems in place for those most vulnerable? Locally, we have many opportunities to serve. Volunteering within you professional organization, serving on a board, or being engaged in community activities where you may shine as a professional nurse! I would encourage each of you to take inventory of your talents, desires and ambitions as you reflect on the 2020 International Year of the Nurse and Midwife.

Nevada State Board of Nursing Q Toll-Free 1-888-590-6726 Q nevadanursingboard.org 12Memento mori\" is a Latin phrase meaning, \"remember you must die\" (Merriam-Webster, n.d.) 1. Many scholars believe this phrase originated in ancient Roman times wherein slaves followed triumphant generals chanting \"memento mori\" after they won a battle. This was to remind successful warriors that they, along with peasants, soldiers and kings were also mortal. Ancient Romans recognized that mortality is the great human equalizer, but this realization has been muted in recent times. This is a fact: we all are born and we all die. Still, we do not speak of death often. Our conversations about death are often whispered murmurings in the background. History shows us that ancient cultures experienced death differently than we do currently. Cultural changes including urbanization and moving the sick into hospitals instead of homes are a few of the factors contributing to the invisibility around death our reluctance to discuss it. In our hectic lifestyles, we have few opportunities to ponder our final days. We currently live in a culture where people are kept alive at all costs; we put our faith in medical technology rather than considering the unique desires of people facing life-limiting illnesses. Furthermore, death's inevitability is often viewed as negative, and this would not be a popular topic to bring up at a dinner party! Despite our efforts to ignore death, we must acknowledge that we, along with our patients and families, face death just like the triumphant generals in ancient Roman times: we will all die. Mercifully, a Conscious Dying Movement (CDM) is unfolding globally and changing this longstanding approach to death. This new age CDM is relevant to the nursing profession. Nurses should grasp two basic premises to become acquainted with CDM philosophies. First and foremost, to have a good death, we must first have a good life. Conscious dying is based on the premise that we too will die: \"memento mori.\" We must accept death. This acceptance can encourage healing, spiritual awakening, goal setting and allow us to gracefully march into death fulfilled and unafraid. A second key CDM premise is to return death to a beautiful, sacred life transition. Nursing and The Conscious Dying MovementBy Pam Call, MSN, RN, APRN, FNP-BC, CEN, CNE \" 13It was not until I participated in a death doula training that I fully faced my own death. During this death doula training at the Conscious Dying Institute (CDI), I discovered that my journey through life had lost focus because I had buried some of my life passions to care for others (CDI) 2. I experienced a metamorphosis through imagining myself dying, saying my goodbyes, and reflecting on my life journey, relationships and life legacy. Looking at my life from this perspective allowed me to acknowledge that much of my life was spent helping others' dreams come true. I discovered that to feel satisfied at the end of life, I need to live the life I truly want to live. I suddenly saw an urgency to travel, mend mendable relationships, create legacies, feel loved, and enjoy life! This outlook is brought to life in the song, sang by Tim McGraw, \"Live like you were dying.\" McGraw's performance of this song written by Nichols and Wiseman quickly became a hit single (Nichols & Wiseman, 2004) 3. In this recording, McGraw describes a father being diagnosed with cancer who reflects on life. He advises his son to \"love deeper,\" \"speak sweeter,\" and find adventure and purpose in living. Due to our proximity with patients with difficult diagnoses, nurses can learn these attributes from our dying patients. If we listen closely, dying patients can leave an imprint on our life journey. We do not need to wait until we are faced with a life limiting illness to make changes. Nurses also have the crucial responsibility to respond to patients who suddenly hear the news of a terminal illness. We often struggle with how to do this effectively and unselfishly. How a nurse supports a newly diagnosed patient during these crucial life changing moments depends on the nurses' own personal self-reflection and understanding of death (Rosa & Estes, 2016) 4. Nurses must do the hard work of exploring themselves so they can help patients have a beautiful end of life experience. Through examining our feelings about death, we can confidently support our patients and remind them: to have a good death, you must have a good life. The second notable conscious dying philosophy is to return death to beautiful, sacred life transition (Rosa & Estes, 2016) 4. Nurses have to ability to help patients recognize the spirituality and uniqueness in the moments surrounding death, just as we celebrate the birthing process. There are many similarities between our modern-day birthing and conscious dying evolutions. Throughout the last fifty years, we have seen a shift in our attitudes regarding life and birth events. Focused attention to both these transitions emerged around the same period. In 1967, Cicel opened the first modern hospice in London (Richmond, 2005) 5, just as new fathers demanded a front seat in the delivery room, and mothers strove to enforce individualized birthing plans. The CDM and birthing movement share many similarities. Our society has begun to honor both thresholds of life. As Rosa and Estes (2016) 4 proclaim, our society no longer sees birth and death as medical events but rather, \"rites of passage.\" Nurses have an honorable role in facilitating both birth and life transitions. We experience, mourn, memorialize and honor birth and death events along with our patients and their families. At the moment a baby is born, nurses celebrate a baby's first breath with family, just as they share the silent reverence at the moment a patient takes their last breath. Conscious dying encourages us to think of the first breath of life as similar to the first sentence in our life journey memoir. Likewise, our last dying breath is the concluding statement in the last chapter in our book of life. We begin and end this book without a clear knowledge of where the story began or where it will lead us. Nurses honor the memories that unfold during these transitions. For instance, hearing the first wail of a newborn and the words, \"I love you,\" from a dying parent are equally respected and revered by nurses. Additionally, nurses know through tough experience that birth and death are natural events that cannot always be controlled with medical technology and we stand by our patients and offer support during these times. Furthermore, nurses are forever present during the arduous and anxious waiting periods for birth and death to occur. Nurses have the opportunity to facilitate important communications during these important waiting periods at these bookends of life. Finally, as in birth, there is a trend to utilize death doulas who beautifully coach our patients through the death transition right alongside nurses. The CDM supports the essential role of nurses in facilitating the spiritual, meaningful, and unique end of life experiences that they help tailor these death experiences to individual patient's desires. If you would like to learn more about the CDM, there are many sources available. Nevada State College (NSC) has launched an innovative course in the RN to BSN program entitled, The Theory and Practice of Conscious Dying: Nursing 437. In this course, students explore their own life journey and address spiritual, relational and practical realms that need to change in order to have a good life and a good death. By self-exploration, students improve their skills in caring for others during the important transition from life to death. More information regarding this course and NSC's RN to BSN program can be obtained by visiting the website https://online.nsc.edu/programs/rn-to-bsn.aspx or contacting Chantelle Cook, Post-Licensure Coordinator @ chantelle.cook@nsc.edu. I wish to thank my mentor, Tarron Estes, founder of the CDI for her assistance in developing the Theory and Practice of Conscious Dying course, and for teaching me \"memento mori.\" Please send any comments or questions to pam.call@nsc.edu.

Nevada State Board of Nursing Q Toll-Free 1-888-590-6726 Q nevadanursingboard.org 14Traditionally nursing education programs have trained registered nurses to work largely within acute care settings. However, with the shift of healthcare moving to a preventive, primary care, community-based approach, students and practicing registered nurses need to be prepared to provide care within these changing delivery systems. According to Wojnar & Whelan (2017), in order for this paradigm shift in healthcare to occur, all stakeholders need to be involved, including nursing education. Additionally, the American Academy of Ambulatory Care Nursing (AAACN) asserts; \"creating a future that maximizes the role of the registered nurse in an evolving healthcare environment will require sustained forward movement in nursing practice, education, research, and leadership.\" (AAACN position statement, 2016) Through the creation and implementation of the Registered Nurses in Primary Care (RNPC) scholar initiative, nursing students will receive the knowledge and skills needed to function within primary care teams while addressing population health needs. Jen\u00e9 Hurlbut, PhD, MSN, MS, RN, CNE Jo Andrews MSHA, RN Imelda R. Revuelto, MSEd RNPC Scholars: Preparing For the Future of Healthcare 15The RNPC scholar initiative is supported and funded through a Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) grant. RNPC Grant and Scholars In the summer of 2018, Roseman University of Health Sciences College of Nursing was awarded an HRSA grant entitled the \"Nurse Education, Practice, Quality and Retention -Registered Nurses in Primary Care (RNPC) Training Program.\" The goals of the RNPC grant are to: Increase the number of undergraduate students who are committed to practice in underserved and rural areas; Develop and implement a replicable undergraduate nursing curriculum that provides education and experiential training related to primary care; Enhance registered nurses' abilities to address population health outcomes and the public health needs of underserved populations supporting the initiatives of Healthy People 2020; and Provide career support and guidance to the RNPC scholars to increase the number of baccalaureate-prepared nurses who will be employed in rural and medically underserved areas. The overall intent of the RNPC grant is to recruit and train nursing students and current RN's to practice in community-based, primary care teams. The hope is this initiative will ultimately increase access to care and improve population health outcomes for underserved populations. Through the offering of educational workshops, curricular enhancements, and unique clinical experiences practicing nurses and RNPC nursing scholar students will receive the necessary training to address the primary healthcare needs of various vulnerable populations. The RNPC training program is being implemented at both the Roseman University of Health Sciences Nevada and Utah campuses and the surrounding communities within rural and underserved areas, thereby supporting the initiatives of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Health People 2020. (https://www.healthypeople.gov/) The RNPC grant foresees enrollment of students participating in the RNPC scholar initiative to increase from year two through year four of the grant. We anticipate clinical groups will have eight students per group. Therefore, enrollment increases are forecasted in increments of eight and are as follows: Methodology Several courses have been identified to provide the didactic and clinical knowledge and experiences that address the key concepts associated with the RNPC training initiative. Examples of these concepts include underserved populations, vulnerability, social determinants of health, rural health, care coordination, and leadership principles. Moreover, RNPC students will earn a minimum of 150 hours in clinical experiences within primary care settings that include rural health locations. Students will travel to rural and underserved areas to obtain training in primary care settings both within Utah and Nevada. Identified clinical courses for primary care experience include Fundamentals of Nursing, Community and Mental Health Nursing, and Senior Practicum.

Deance, Arizona..Nevada State Board of Nursing Toll-Free 1-888-590-6726 Q nevadanursingboard.org 16Curriculum Enhancements- Clinical and Didactic Our goal in including primary care and rural nursing education is to offer students the opportunity to develop the knowledge and skills required to provide high-quality care based on a patient's specific needs. This higher level of education will not be based on the students' ability to recall or reproduce information. Instead, it will be based on helping the students understand and alter any misconceived views. There are a different set of strengths and challenges associated with living and working in rural areas. In these areas, you may have children lending a hand on the farm or with the livestock, household chores, or responsibilities associated with taking care of younger siblings, etc. It is important to help the students learn about primary care, address any preconceived notions, and take this education to the rural areas. The students' education starts in the didactic arena. The curriculum needs to include didactic strategies that enable students to learn nursing skills, solve problems, and develop reflective and critical thinking. Students take these skills into the practice areas. The didactic strategies put into the curriculum support the nursing students' experiences of learning and then apply that information in their clinical experiences. In most nursing programs, the curriculum is based on working in a hospital or inpatient unit. For our program, we changed the students' clinical setting to primary care, rather than the usual inpatient or community-based agency settings.The didactic portion of the program starts in fundamentals, where students are exposed to the idea of primary care. This concept is threaded throughout the program, along with topics that are vital to the goals of Healthy People 2020, such as the opioid crisis and childhood obesity. These topics are important and approached differently depending on the community you are working with. Teaching this in the didactic portion, and then having the students work in rural areas helps solidify what they are learning. At graduation, students are prepared for working within a variety of different communities. The goal is to expose student nurses to the role of a rural health nurse. In this role, the nurse works with patients who live in geographically and culturally remote areas with very little access to health care. Students will expand their skills in all areas of nursing by seeing the variety of patients routinely cared for in these types of locations. This experience teaches students the qualities needed to serve as a primary caregiver to an entire community. Student Experiences The RNPC students had their first primary care experiences in the fall of 2019 at rural locations. Students in Nevada and Utah were exposed to challenges that can occur when providing and seeking healthcare in underserved areas. Students initially said they felt some culture shock with the rural environment as opposed to living in a large urban area. However, the students felt extremely welcomed within these communities by the healthcare providers, staff, and community members and quickly overcame their nervousness. Additionally, the students commented that during the clinical rotations, they felt challenged and supported to learn and apply their nursing knowledge. Several students remarked that after this clinical experience they would now consider living and practicing as a professional nurse in a rural community. Conclusion Given the future shift of healthcare delivery to one that centers on primary care, it becomes imperative for nursing education to reflect this change and ensure that students are prepared to provide care within these settings. (Albutt, et al., 2013) This includes updating the nursing curriculum to include preventive and primary-care-focused content with an emphasis on the concepts addressing underserved such as rural health, vulnerability, care coordination, and the social determinants of health. Furthermore, it is also important to provide practicing nurses with the knowledge and understanding of these same concepts as the healthcare arena evolves. Providing care in primary and community care settings is an exciting and challenging opportunity for the nursing profession, as exemplified by one student comment, \"Being in a clinic that patients have to travel hours to come to due to their remote location, showed me how important preventative health and primary care is.\" continued from page 15 References Albutt, G., Ali, P., & Watson, R.

To determine your level of organization, Barbara Hemphill, CEO of Hemphill Productivity Institute in Raleigh, N.C., and author of \"The Paper Tiger at Work,\" recommends you ask yourself these questions: Can I find what I need? Does my office work? Does it work for other people on my staff?\"If the answer to any of these questions is no, your lack of organization is costing you time, productivity and money,\" says Ms. Hemphill. She offers the following suggestions on how to get and stay organized. Make decisions Recognize that clutter indicates postponed decisions. Desks and filing cabinets become inundated with paper- and computers with files - because we don't make decisions. In reality, you have only three choices. Simple Steps for Getting & StAYing Organized19\"I call it the FAT System: File, Act or Toss. File means \"I don't know if I'll ever need it, but I don't have the nerve to throw it out!\" Act means 'The ball is in my court to do it or delegate it.' And toss speaks for itself,\" says Ms. Hemphill. Toss it Practice the art of waste-basketry on an ongoing basis and encourage others to do the same. According to Ms. Hemphill, research shows that people never use 80 percent of what they keep. But how do you decide what you really need? For each piece of information, whether paper of electronic, ask these questions: Does this require action? Does it exist elsewhere? Would it be difficult to get again? Is it recent enough to be useful? Keep contacts Implement a fail-safe system for contact information. Many of the pieces of paper that clutter up your desk are deemed valuable because of a name, address or phone number. Choose a system for tracking this information and use it consistently. Find it Turn your filing system into a \"Finding System.\" If your filing system isn't working. Ignore it and start over. Clean out your most accessible file space and put unused files into less accessible space if you're not comfortable tossing them. Begin your new system and as you need information from the old files, incorporate it into the new system. \"The key to the continuing success of your filing system is a File Index- a list of your files titles, \"sys Ms. Hemphill. \"you can create a File Index with a word-processing or spreadsheet program.\" On the road Manage your paper on the road as well as you do in the office. Turn your briefcase into a \"mini-office\". Carry files folders labeled by specific action. \"Act\", for example, is for papers you'll work on while you travel. A \"Call\" file makes it easy for you to spend the 15 minutes before a flight to make one or two quick calls. \"Discuss with your assistant\" contains papers to be handled when you return. \"Be sure to include 'File\"- with a copy of your File Index. As you collect papers along the way that you want to file, check the File Index for the keyword or number and write it in the upper-righthand corner of the paper,\" says Ms. Hemphill. \"When you return, filing will be easy.\" Keeping Work Stress from Coming Home Is work stress coming home with you, along with tension, irritability, and anxiety? Experiment with these environmental controls and behavioral tactics to see if they don't steer your thoughts and reflexes away from work and worries. 1. Before leaving work, participate in a ritual that \"completes your day.\" For example, put things away, stack paper neatly, roll your chair under your desk, dust a couple of shelves, and empty the wastebasket. Take a good look at your office or workspace, \"feel the completion\" of you day- and leave. These behaviors, practiced daily for just a week, will begin to compartmentalize work and home. 2. If bringing work home is unavoidable, don't place it on the kitchen counter, dinette, or with house clutter as you walk through the door. Instead, create a special location in your home physically removed from areas where you engage with loved ones. 3. Create digital communications habits that reinforce boundaries. For example, on your voice mail, say that you are gladly available, but only if it is urgent, along with instructions for the caller for what to do next. Note that you can experience a 99% reduction in unnecessary phone calls if. You simply allow the caller to decide if the concern is so urgent that it can't wait. Most of the time, it really can. Compartmentalization, boundaries, and smartphone management- these are instruments of work-life balance. Make them work for you. Make the Most of a Bad Day at Work Everyone experiences job-related setbacks and mistakes at work (\"a bad day\"). Our initial focus is usually how awful we feel or how unfair \"it\" all seemed. The challenge is moving past the negativity. Accomplish these strategies that add to your resilience. Here are six \"T's\" to recapture a positive you: Temporary: Remind yourself that feeling bad is temporary; it will soon dissipate. Teach: What can the day teach you? What part of it will add to your skills and abilities? Talk: Talk and vent your experience with a friend to exercise, or play- engage in physical activity to influence a positive mood. Transcribe: Write down your feelings. Thanks: Focus on two to three things you are grateful for despite the setback, to help reenergize positivity. Mechanics of Making Deadlines Don't allow the quality of your work to suffer by missing deadlines. Meeting deadlines is an acquired skill with two influences- motivational and mechanical. Motivational: Agree on the deadline with your partner (recipient of the work). Next, commit to the deadline. Then, acknowledge and empathize with the direct and indirect consequences of not meeting the deadline. Make an accountability pact- allow your partner to contact you at any time about progress. Mechanical: Know how much time each part of your project will take. Divide it into mini-deadlines. Adopt an early completion point (your buffer). Success will reinforce your on-time habit, and a positive reputation will follow.Nevada State Board of Nursing Q Toll-Free 1-888-590-6726 Q nevadanursingboard.org 20NURSING NEWS NURSING NEWSNevada State Board ofNevada State Board of ADMINISTRATION 5011 Meadowood Mall Way, Suite 300, Reno, NV 89502, 888-590-6726 4220 S.

Many are surprised that in the midst of an epidemic, these tests are actually NOT very useful, due to its relatively poor Negative Predictive value. The Negative Predictive value of an RIDT (the proportion of patients with negative results who do not have influenza) is lowest when influenza activity is high in the population being tested. Therefore, false-negative results are more likely to occur when influenza prevalence is high in the community. These tests are costly and of little value, because they are actually not significantly better than clinical diagnosis. However, many patients, and even some clinicians, seek the objective assurance of these tests not knowing their limitations. Remember, a negative test does not indicate the lack of an influenza infection. The CDC states, \"Confirmation of influenza virus infection by diagnostic testing is not required for decisions to prescribe antiviral medication. Decision-making should be based upon signs and symptoms consistent with influenza illness and epidemiologic factors.\" Further, \"Initiation of empiric antiviral treatment should not be delayed while influenza testing results are pending. Antiviral treatment is clinically most beneficial when started as close to illness onset as possible. Influenza vaccine effectiveness is moderate and so a history of current season influenza vaccination does not exclude a diagnosis of influenza.\" Rapid testing may be helpful when influenza incidence is low, alerting a community when \"the flu season\" actually begins, but not when it has arrived. Signs and symptoms of uncomplicated influenza vary by age, underlying health conditions, and immune function. Common signs and symptoms include fever with nonproductive cough or other suggestive respiratory symptoms, often with myalgias or headache. Fever is not always present, including in premature and young infants, immunocompromised and immunosuppressed persons, and especially in elderly persons. Note that some persons may have atypical presentations -especially infants (e.g. sepsis-like syndrome) and elderly (e.g. confusion).THE VALUE OF RAPID INFLUENZA TESTING By David H.
