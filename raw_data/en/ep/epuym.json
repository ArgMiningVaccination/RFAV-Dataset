Through public awareness, healthy habits, research and effective health care, the prevention and control of infectious disease is possible. As published in the March 2008 issue of Indianapolis W oman magazineEFFECTIVE INFECTION PREVENTIONFight infectious disease with good habits and knowledge As a physician, treatment of infections is a mainstay of medical practice. However, physicians are not the only ones who play acritical role in infection prevention: Everyone has a role. Women are usually the first teachers and promoters of infection prevention in the family. From teaching children how and when to washtheir hands to properly preparing food to disinfecting the home, womenmodel behaviors children and others can follow. In addition, womengenerally care for those who are ill in the home, and knowing how to carefor illnesses and seek health care advice is extremely important. The world of infectious diseases is changing. Disease organisms change to cause new infections. Other infections we thought wereconquered have returned. Antibiotics are no longer \"magic bullets\" dueto improper and overuse. But, we still have effective weapons against infectious diseases. The tried-and-true practices we learned from our mothers, such as handwashing, staying home when you are ill and covering your mouth whenyou cough or sneeze, are as important as ever. Immunizations remain atop weapon in fighting infectious disease. Accurate, scientifically soundhealth information also is critical. Not all health-related information is created equal, and knowing accurate health information can make a big difference. And, nature hasarmed us with our body's own defensive force: a powerful immunesystem. Keeping your immune system healthy is our first line of defenseagainst infections. By practicing and modeling infection-fighting habits, getting the right information and keeping ourselves healthy, everyone can preventand control the spread of infection.

From our attempts to ward off the flu with yearly shots to our awareness of the food we eat to the number of timesa day we wash our hands, infectious diseases im pact our lives. Caused by bacteria, viruses, fungi and parasites, references to ancient scourges, such as leprosy and smallpox, can be found in sacred texts, myths andart. Evidence of infectious diseases has been found in mummified remains. Infectious diseases have shaped the course of history. They include plague epidemics that swept medieval Europe; smallpox outbreaks that wiped outnative communities following the discovery of the New World; and the influenza pandemic of 1918-19 that greatly affected World War I battles. The 20th century saw great advancements to reduce the impact of infectious diseases such as mass vaccination, sanitation improvements, and the discovery and development of antibiotics. The rates of death and illnesses due to infectiousdiseases declined sharply. However, in the last two decades of the 20th century, that trend has changed. New diseases, such as AIDS, and the re-emergence of \"old\" diseases,such as tuberculosis, have appeared and continue to spread. The developmentof antibiotic resistance poses a significant challenge for treatment of bacterialinfections that for many years had been easily treated. Other challenges with infectious diseases also exist. Although smallpox was eradicated and plague infections in humans are extremely rare, the threat of widespread transmission exists with bioterrorism. The outbreaks of SARS in Toronto in 2003, monkeypox in the Midwest in 2003 and measles in Indiana in 2005 remind us that oceans no longer isolateus from the rest of the world. Through air transportation, you are 24 hours away from any infectious disease on earth. Multi-state outbreaks relating to food contamination and thelikelihood of an influenza pandemic also remind us that infectious diseases areever present. Infectious diseases and the possibilities of devastating effects are frightening. However, we do have several potent weapons against them, which aredescribed in the next several pages. We cannot live in fear, and we cannot livein denial. Armed with a healthy respect for infec tious diseases and the measures to prevent them, however, we can lessen their impact. Shaping History Infectious disease impacts world events by Pam Pontones, MA, Director of Surveillance andInvestigation, Indiana State Department of Health Historical Disease Remains a Threat More than 10 million people in the U.S. have latent tuberculosis by Tina Feaster, Tuberculosis Epidemiologist, Indiana State Department of Health More than 100 years ago, tuberculosis was the leading cause of death in all age groups in the United States. Itwas estimated the tuberculosisbacillus infected 80 percent to 90 percent of thepopu lation at that time. Although many people may not be aware of it, the threat of TB remains alive. Nearly one-third of the world'spopulation is infected with TB, according to the Centers forDisease Control and Prevention. In an increasingly globalsociety, the chance of being infected by TB is still possible. TB is transmitted through droplets r eleased when people cough, speak or sing. These germs can float in the airfor several hours, depending on the environment. TB bacteria then enter the lungs, but in most people withhealthy immune systems, the bacteria simply remaindormant. This is called latent tuberculosis infection. People with the latent infection don't feel sick and are not infectious. Dr. Richard Kohler, m edical advisor for the Indiana State Department of Health's TB program, says TBbacteria can remain dormant but alive in our bodies foryears, only to awaken and cause disease when we becomevulnerable. If not treated, active TB can be deadly. In 2005, 1.6 m illion people worldwide died from TB. The greatest risk for LTBI to become active occurs within the first two years after infection. The greatest risk for LTBI to progr ess is to also be infected with HIV or when other conditions that weaken the immune systemare present. Other high-risk factors include becominginfected with LTBI in infancy or early childhood, diabetes,abnormal chest X-rays and treatment with medicines tosuppress our immune systems, like steroids. Fortunately, LTBI can be detected through skin and blood testing, and active disease can be prevented.T reatment typically includes a nine-month course of the antibiotic Isoniazid. Active infection requires additionalantibiotics, and the treatment must be carefully followed.See your health care provider if you think you may havebeen exposed to TB. The spread of LTBI can be stopped. Become an active participant in your own health care, and take antibiotics appropriately. Tr eating LTBI prevents active TB disease from occurring. EFFECTIVE INFECTION PREVENTIONDespite the amazing healing power of antibiotics, they're not magic bulletsfor all illnesses. Antibiotics are only effective against bacterial infections, such asstrep throat, ear infections and sinus infections.They do not cure viral infections, such as thecommon cold, most sore throats and influenza. Improper use of antibiotics can lead to resistance in bacteria, making antibioticsineffective. Penicillin was the first \"miracle\" drug to drastically change the treatment of bacterialdiseases. Antibiotics became widely used in1940s and have greatly reduced illness anddeath caused by bacterial infections. Today, there are many forms of antibiotics, each designed to work against a specific typeof bacteria. However, this same widespreadantibiotic use also has created a major publichealth threat of antibiotic resistance. Over the past decade, the number of bacteria resistant to antibiotics has increased.Each time a person takes antibiotics, sensitivebacteria are killed, but resistant germs maybecome stronger and less responsive toantibiotics and can spread quickly to others. Antibiotic resistance occurs when bacteria change in a way that reduces or eliminatesthe effectiveness of antibiotics. Theseresistant bacteria survive and multiply, creatingnew strains of bacteria that are more difficultto cure and more expensive to treat. Insome cases, these illnesses can lead to serious disability or death.Amazing Antibiotics Experts debate whether the wonder drug is overused by Jean Svendsen RN, BS, Chief Nurse Consultant, Indiana State Department of Health Repeated and improper uses of antibiotics are the primary causes for the increase in antibiotic resistant bacteria. To prevent resistance, follow these simple guidelines: >> Do not demand an antibiotic when your health care provider has determined one is not needed \u2014 such as for a viralinfection. >> Do not share or take another's antibiotic. That antibiotic may not be appropriate for your infection. >> Take antibiotics exactly as your health care provider has prescribed. >> Finish taking all of your medication. You may begin to feel better before the antibiotics kill all the bacteria. >> Viral infections may lead to bacterial infections. If an illness becomes worse or does not improve over time, contact yourhealth care provider. Even healthy peoplewho have never taken antibiotics can becomeinfected with antibiotic resistant bacteriafrom others. Avoiding close contact withothers who are ill and properly washingyour hands can reduce the risk for viral and bacterial infections. Further information about the proper use of antibiotics is provided by the CDC's Get Smart: Know When Antibiotics Workcampaign at www.cdc.gov/drugresistance/community/ or the Indiana Coalition forAntibiotic Resistance Education Strategies(ICARES) program at www.icares.org. Health Check Make sure medical centers aren't putting you at risk for infection by Sara Sczesny, MT (ASCP), graduatestudent intern,Indiana StateDepartment of Health The places you visit for trusted healthcare \u2014 including the doctor's officeor the hospital \u2014 also may be the places where you can get sick. One of the most common risks associated with receiving health care services is aninfection. These health care-associatedinfections can occur in any health care setting.It is estimated 2 million HAIs occur eachyear in the United States \u2014 affecting aboutone out of every 150 people, according toAdvanced Practice in Acute Critical Care . HAIs are most commonly caused by bacteria, and the most common HAIs arelower respiratory and urinary tract infections.Skin and blood infections also may occur. Young children and the elderly are at greater risk since they have weaker immunesystems. However, all patients are at risk.Antibiotic resistance has become a greater EFFECTIVE INFECTION PREVENTIONproblem with some hospital-acquired infections, making them more difficult to treat. Getting proper care means consumers must be aware of their options; able to effectiv ely communicate their symptoms, concerns and health care needs; ask goodquestions; and just as importantly, ensureproper health care etiquette is practicedwhere they are treated. Something as simple as a proper hand- washing technique has a direct effect onyour ability to get healthy \u2014 and stayhealthy \u2014 while being treated by yourhealth care provider. To reduce your risk ofgetting a health care associated infection orHAI, it is OK to ask your health careproviders about their hand hygiene policiesand whether they washed their hands beforebeginning your procedure. The best way for health care providers to prevent HAIs is to use proper hand hygiene,which includes the use of alcohol-basedhand sanitizers and proper hand washing. Health care providers should use alcohol- based hand sanitizer when hands are notvisibly soiled, and they should wash handswhen hands are soiled and before and aftereach use of gloves. Properly washing handsincludes wetting the hands, applying soapand rubbing hands vigorously for 15 seconds,rinsing and then drying hands thoroughly. Schools and facilities closed for dis- infection. Sporting events cancelled.Worried school officials and concerned parents. What is MRSA all about? Here aresome facts to help you understand thesebacte ria. WWhhaatt iiss MMRRSSAA?? Staphylococcus aureus is a common bacterium found on the skin in the armpit, groin, and nose of about 30 percent of people.Normally, these bacteria do not cause illness.If these bacteria enter the body through a skinbreak, they can cause localized skin infectionslike pimples and boils. These infections aregenerally minor and easily treated with antibi-otics. Rarely, staph bacteria can cause serious, even fatal, infections, if the bacteria enter the bloodstream or infect a major body organ. Methicillin-resistant Staph aureus (MRSA) is a type of Staph aureus bacteria that haddeveloped resistance to the antibioticmethicillin and usually several otherantibiotics. This resistance makes MRSAinfections more difficult to treat. A small percentage of the population also carries MRSA on the skin or in the nose. MostMRSA infections are localized skin infectionsthat are treatable with appropriate antibiotics.Rarely MRSA bacteria may cause serious orfatal infections if the bacteria enter thebloodstr eam or infect a major body organ. MRSA is not a new infection, nor is it specific to Indiana. However, the occurrence ofhealth care- and community-acquired strainsof resistant bacteria is an increasing problem,particularly among hospitalized patients withMRSA skin and soft tissue infections thatrequires effective and timely treatment. HHooww iiss MMRRSSAA sspprreeaadd?? >> Direct skin contact with an infected person \u2014 wound pus or drainage is very infectious.>> Contact with contaminated objects or surfaces like towels, razors, soap, bedding, wound bandages and athletic equipment. >> Picking at wounds or skin lesions with fingers. >> Poor hand hygiene. HHooww iiss MMRRSSAA ttrreeaatteedd?? Generally, MRSA infections are treatable with the appropriate antibiotics. Your health care provider will decide which antibiotic isappropriate for you. Through clinical studies,more effective treatments for antibioticresist ant diseases continue to be discovered. HHooww iiss MMRRSSAA pprreevveenntteedd?? Prevention is important and easy. Proper prevention at all times can help decrease the incidence of MRSA infections. Practice frequent and appropriate hand hygiene. Alcohol-based hand sanitizersshould be readily available in addition tofunctional hand-washing facilities. Parents,school officials and coaches should practiceand encourage frequent hand hygiene. Keep open areas on the skin covered with a waterproof or impermeable bandage. Do nottouch another person's bandages or open skinareas. Do not share personal hygiene items like soap, towels, deodorant and clothing. Practice prompt effective wound care. Wash all wounds thoroughly with soap and water;apply an antiseptic and a waterproof bandage.Deep wounds, like cuts, puncture woundsand human or animal bites, require promptmedical attention. You may receive a tetanusshot if the wound was dirty or if more than fiveyears have passed since your last tetanus shot. See your health care provider immediately if you notice wounds or skin breaks that are red,swollen, painful or draining. Students,including athletes, who notice thesewounds at school, should immediately report them to the school nurse or athletic coach. Understanding MRSA With the infection becoming a new household word, families' fears of the bacteria are heightened by Jean Svendsen, RN, Chief Nurse Consultant, Indiana State Department of HealthEFFECTIVE INFECTION PREVENTIONThere's nothing like being on an airplane or in an elevator with someone who issneezing, coughing, feverish and just plain sick. You are an innocent bystander now suscept- ible to respiratory illnesses like colds and flu thatcan be spread person to person through dropletsreleased when others cough or sneeze. Thesedroplets move through the air, and then weinhale them through our mouths or noses,especially when we are in confined spaces.Germs also can be spread when you touch contaminated surfaces like elevator buttons,desktops or the handy pens at the grocery store. When you touch your own eyes, mouth or nose before washing hands, these dropletscan infect you with myriad illnesses. Someviruses and bacteria even can live two hoursor longer on surfaces like cafeteria tables,doorknobs, telephone and desks. To avoid illnesses like colds and flu, follow these simple tips: Avoid close contact. Stay away from people who are sick. If you're sick, keep your distancefrom others to protect them from getting sick. Stay home when you are sick, especially if you have a fever. In some cases, it's against Indiana law to go to work with a fever or othersymptoms. Many schools and child care providers have policies restricting those whoNothing to Sneeze At Learn the rules of etiquette for the sick by Shawn Richards, BS, Respiratory Disease Epidemiologist, Indiana State Department of Health are ill from attending. Cover your mouth and nose. Use the bend of your elbow or upper sleeve to cover your mouth and nose when sneezing or coughing.You trap more germs by completely coveringyour nose and mouth to absorb the dropletsthat naturally flow downward after your sneezeor cough. If you use tissues, throw them awayimmediately. Do not use cloth handkerchiefs. Clean your hands. Washing your hands often will help protect you from germs. Usesoap and running water, but if it is not available,an alcohol-based hand sanitizer can be effectiveagainst some germs. Wash your hands longenough to sing \"Happy Birthday\" twice. Avoid touching your eyes, nose or mouth. Germs often are spread when a person touchessomething contaminated, then touches his orher eyes, nose or mouth where germs can enterthe body. Wash your hands before touchingyour eyes, nose or mouth.

In a hurry-up world, taking time to washyour hands often and properly remains thesingle most effective means of ridding yourself of the germs that can cause you topick up an infection. The common cold, influenza, ear infections, strep throat and other dis eases all can be spread because of unwashed or improperlywashed hands. So, clean up your act, andconsciously take time to effectively cleangerms from your hands for better health.

CCuuttss aanndd mmiinnoorr iinnjjuurriieess Keep infections at bay by properly treating wounds and scrapes. A few healthy habits can help them heal faster without becominginfected. Any break in your skin provides a route for germs to enter your body and cause aninfection. Before and after cleaning a woundor changing a bandage, wash your hands. For surface wounds, like scrapes, abrasions and minor cuts, thoroughly wash the injuredarea with cool water to remove dirt anddebris. You can hold the wound under runningwater. Use soap and a soft washcloth to cleanthe skin around the wound. Then apply asterile bandage. Deeper wounds such as deep cuts, puncture wounds, and human or animal bites requireprompt medical attention. You may receive a tetanus shot if the wound was dirty or if more than five yearshave passed since your last tetanus shot. Ifyou see signs of infection \u2014 such as rednessaround the wound, red streaks extendingfrom the wound, swelling or yellowishdrainage \u2014 see your health care providerright away. Since germs can be transmitted on personal items, it's important to refrain from sharingitems such as toothbrushes, razors, deodorant,drinking or eating utensils, towels andwashcloths. Keeping a clean home also creates a healthier home. You can eliminate germsby disinfecting frequently touched hardsurfaces within your home such as lightswitches, doorknobs, phones, sinks, toiletsand kitchen counters. Use a product that isdesigned to kill a broad spectrum of harmfulbacteria, such as staph and salmonella, andyour teeth; your eyes by wiping them orleaning on your hand; your nose by wiping or scratching; and even your ears, these germscan enter your body and make you sick. Many diarrheal illnesses can be spread from person to person by individuals who don'twash their hands after using the toilet or diapering children. Wash your hands corr ectly, and send those germs down the drain! Hand washing is so important to disease prevention that the Indiana State Departmentof Health has developed a Web site exclusivelyfor hand-washing information.

EFFECTIVE INFECTION PREVENTIONcalled the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System, or VAERS. From 1991 to 2001, more than 1.9 billion vaccines were distributed in the United States.VAERS reported the total adverse eventsfollowing immunization were significantlyless than 1 percent of the total vaccinesdistributed during this 10-year period. Themost common adverse reaction reportedfollowing a vaccination was fever, accordingto Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report . Though factual data exists on the devas- tating impact of vaccine-preventable diseases, many people are influenced by often misleadinginformation that produces unnecessaryfear of immunizations. As a result, they avoid getting the recommended vaccinations. Recent history shows the impact of decreased vaccinations. A 2005 measlesoutbreak in Indiana raised awareness formany about the need to be protectedthrough immunization. Within four weeks,34 cases were identified, and three of theseindividuals were hospitalized. One requiredmechanical ventilation. The outbreak wastraced to an unvaccinated individual whowas exposed to measles while traveling overseas. The goal of public health is eliminating disease. One of the best weapons to preventdisease is vaccination. In 1980, the World Health Organizationdeclared smallpox \u2014 an often fatal anddisfiguring disease \u2014 had been eradicated from the globe. This historic achievement was accomplished through aggressive, worldwide vaccinationcampaigns. Just one or two generations before,images of disabled children and a United Statespresident affected by smallpox were common. Through immunization, polio has been eliminated from all but a few countries, makingleg braces and iron lungs distant memories. In 2002, more than 500,000 deaths due to measles were reported worldwide,accord ing to WHO. That same year, due to routine childhood vaccination, only 41 casesof measles were reported in the United States.T wo of those cases occurred in Indiana, andthere were no deaths. Despite these successes, concern over the safety of vaccines has been a topic of debateduring recent years. In the United States,more than 10 million vaccinations per yearare given to children under age 1. Though thereare risks associated with the administrationof any medication, adverse events fromimmunizations are rare, and severe reactionsare even less common.

TheCenters for Disease Control and Preventionestimates 76 million cases of foodborneillness \u2014 representing one out of every fourpeople \u2014 occur in the United States eachyear, with more than 1,200 cases identifiedeach year in Indiana. Many organisms can cause foodborne illnesses, some of which are merely a nuisance,and others, like botulism, which can be deadly.Contrary to popular belief, foodborne illnessalmost never is caused by the last meal eaten.Instead, it's usually the meal you had two toseven days ago, often making it difficult todetermine which food was the culprit. Recent news coverage of foodborne outbreaks might suggest more outbreaks areoccurring. However, much of the reason forthe increase of identified outbreaks is bettertechnology, communication and investigationpractices. Though outbreaks involving common commercial food items are the most alarming,many outbreaks also are associated withrestaurants, caterers, schools and even home-prepared foods. If you suspect you may have a foodborne illness, contact your health care provider andrequest stool testing to determine the cause.Symptoms of foodborne illness, such asdiarrhea and vomiting, are common to manySickening Food Unwanted organisms at the dinner table often cause outbreaks by Lynae Granzow, MPH, Enteric Epidemiologist, Indiana State Department of Health diseases. Also, contact your local health department to report a foodborne complaintor outbreak. Your information may make thedifference in identifying a foodborne outbreak. Though the United States has one of the safest food supplies in the world, responsibilityalso lies with the consumer. Follow thesefood safety tips to prevent foodborne illness: >> Wash your hands thoroughly before and after preparing food. Do not prepare food for others if you are ill with diarrhea orvomiting. Many foodborne illnesses can easilybe passed to others. >> Thaw frozen foods in the refrigerator instead of at room temperature. >> Separate uncooked foods from ready- to-eat foods and cooked foods to avoid cross- contamination. Use separate equipment andutensils for handling raw and cooked foods. >> Clean all produce before eating raw or cooking. >> Cook to USDA-recommended safe minimum internal temperatures and check with a food thermometer. >> Refrigerate food promptly in small containers to speed cooling. >> Heed food recalls. Check your pantry, cabinets and emergency kits for recalled items and discard them appropriately.Inform others. >> Check expiration dates of food items. Discard those that have expired. >> Avoid unpasteurized dairy or juice products. Stomach Woes Tiny culprits can cause big problems with your digestivesystem Norovirus and its notorious cousins are stomach viruses causing up to23 million cases of infectious diarrhea and vomiting in the United States. Most people refer to these illnesses as \"stomach flu,\" which is a misnomer.Influenza or \"the flu\" is a respiratoryillness characterized by coughing, sorethroat and fever and is caused by differentviruses. By contrast, stomach viruses orviral gastroenteritis cause vomiting anddiarrhea. Although you may feel horrible, viral gastroenteritis rarely causes complications.Symptoms, mainly nausea, vomiting anddiarrhea, begin 12 to 72 hours after exposureand last 24 to 48 hours. While there is nocure for viral gastroenteritis, adequatehydration is important, especially for thevery young and the elderly. People may be able to transmit stomach viruses up to two weeks after symptomsstop. It's important to take measures tocontrol the spread of the illness. Stomach viruses can be transmitted through contaminated food, contaminatedsurfaces and person-to-person contactwith someone who is ill. So before youblame the food, consider the peoplearound you with similar symptoms. Theseviruses are very hardy and contagious \u2014commonly passed throughout entiregroups of people, like households, childcare centers, schools and cruise ships. Hereare some tips to avoid passing aroundthese viruses: >>Wash your hands. It's been said many times, but it bears repeating. Clean your hands often with soap and warm w ater, especially after using the restroom, diaperinga child, assisting someone who is ill andcleaning soiled areas. >>Do not share food or beverages. >>Do not go to work or send children to school or daycare while ill. >>Clean hard, nonporous surfaces that are contaminated with a bleach solution made with one cup of bleach and onegallon of water. \u2014 L.G. EFFECTIVE INFECTION PREVENTIONSalmonella Scare Megan Zaborowsky takes action to reduce future threat by Deb Wezensky As a mother to 3-year-old Mia, Megan Zaborowsky knows how to nurtureand care for young children. Her ability to love and care for her daughter also makes her a natural for her calling as a teacherfor Greenwood Community Schools. Because of all her experience with children, Zaborowsky knows how to read the behaviorof children so she can provide a setting inwhich they can be safe to grow and learn. At times, however, it's challenging to discern what may be wrong with a child. Thislesson hit home when her daughter came downwith an unknown illness and had to behospitalized for two days. Mia ran a high fever, followed by severe diarrhea and stomachcramping. Nothing seemed to help. When the child's symptoms worsened, Zaborowsky took her daughter to the doctorat the St. Francis South campus. A stool culturewas taken, and the doctor immediately hadMia admitted to the hospital. It was therethat the diagnosis of salmonella was made. With the help of the Indiana State Department of Health, Zaborowsky was able todetermine the origin of infection. The businesslinked to the salmonella acknowledgedrespon sibility and took the appropriate action to ensure this would not affect other customersin the future. After two and half weeks, Mia was back to her usual active self. Zaborowsky always has taken precautions to provide a clean and healthy environment forher family. However, after the experience ofseeing her young child suffer from salmonella,she admits being more careful about hershopping habits. She is much more thoroughin checking the dates and appearance of fooditems she purchases, as well as the overallcleanliness of where she shops. The very nature of travel createsopportunities for surprises andoften a change of plans that will be an unwelcome part y our excursions. While traveling overseas can have its share of pitfalls, effective planning can keep you healthy soyou can enjoy more of your travel time. Overseas travelers have a 50 percent chance of suffering from a travel-related illness, mostlyfrom gastrointestinal infections con tracted from poorly cooked food or untreated water.Many diseases common in other countriesare nonexistent or rare in the United States. To increase your chances of staying healthy, there are precautions you can take thatmay not be a part of your routine health care.Several vaccines may be recommended \u2014 orrequired \u2014 four to six weeks prior to travel. Typhoid fever, yellow fever and hepatitis A vaccine may be required or recommendedfor travel to some countries, even though theyare not required here in the United States.Malaria, a mosquito-borne illness, is commonin many parts of the world, especially Africa,South America and parts of Asia, and apreventive medication may be necessary. Visiting an international travel clinic a few months before your scheduled trip overseas is avital part of planning for your trip.

EFFECTIVE INFECTION PREVENTIONDisease detectives, officially knownas epidemiolo- gists, inv estigate a variety of events that affect our health. How is thisimportant to you and your family? Epidemiologists essentially are scientists who help maintain your health by investigatinginfectious disease outbreaks, such as influenzaor foodborne illnesses. With their expertise,the goals are to effectively treat the diseaseand to reduce the number of people threatenedby the outbreak. These disease detectives can work for state health departments, federal governmentagencies and some local, city or countyhealth departments. By Indiana law, health care providers, hospitals and laboratories are required toreport certain diseases or laboratory resultsto local health departments. Local publichealth officials investigate these disease casesto find out how people became sick,deter mine whether other people were exposed and implement control measures. As disease detectives investigate cases, these detail-oriented experts look for commonlinks among cases that may provide clues toan outbreak. Local health officials, state health officials and epidemiologists coordinate efforts andexpertise to solve the cases when outbreaksare reported. Sometimes the \"feds\" must becalled in. That is, federal health agenciesmay become involved if an outbreakinvolves multiple states, a commercial fooditem, international port or ship. Epidemiologists gather clues from those Your Role Besides public health officials, the public also has a responsibility in outbreak investigations: If you suspect you may be part of a disease outbreak, contact your local health department. Your input may provide vital clues for health officials to identify an outbreak and prevent additional people from becoming ill. If health officials contact you regarding an outbreak investigation, your cooperation in answering questions fully and being willing to have laboratorytesting done helps keep others safe from infectious disease. Althoughsubmitting \"evidence,\" such as a clinical sample, is sometimes unpleasant, itcan be the key to identifying the illness and making necessary treatmentsavailable to minimize the effects of the disease. Having head lice is an annoying problem that can cause severe itching and evenloss of sleep. Though obnoxious, the good news is lice are not a serious health hazard. Lice are actually small parasitic insects uniquely adapted to living on the scalp andneck hairs of human hosts. Head lice feed onthe blood of their host at least once a day andcannot survive for more than a day at roomtemperature without access to a person's blood. To clear up some common misconceptions about head lice, here are a few facts: >> Lice do not spread between pets and people. >> They are not known to transmit disease from person to person. >> People with poor personal hygiene practices are not more likely to have lice. Hats, brushes and other items that come in contact with your head or hair can transmit lice; hence, the increased possibility of yourchild coming into contact with lice at school.Lice also can spread through close physicalcontact, especially head-to-head contact. Head lice can affect people of all ages and socioeconomic backgrounds. However,children are affected more often. G irls are more commonly affected than boys, andCaucasian children are more frequentlyaffected than those of other eth nicities. About 6 million to 12 million children, ages3 to 12, are infested with head lice each year. T reatment of an active lice infestation relies on the proper use of over-the-counter andprescription medications. Consult with yourhealth care provider or pharmacist to determinethe treatment you should use. A dditional actions to eradicate an infestation are: >> Wash all bed linens, clothes and other items that the infested person has used. Use the hottest washer and dryer settings. >> Thoroughly vacuum rugs, upholstered furniture and mattresses in the household. >> Do not share hairbrushes, combs, hats or other personal items. Head Lice The itchy infestation spreads quickly without precautions by Wayne Staggs, MS, Invasive DiseaseEpidemiologist, IndianaState Department of Health Mysteriously Ill? Disease detectives identify presence of outbreaks by Tom Duszynski, BS, REHS, Field Epidemiology Director, Indiana State Department of Health EFFECTIVE INFECTION PREVENTIONBesides ruining picnics, mosquitoes and ticks can transmit disease. In Indiana,two of the common diseases transmitted by mosquitoes and ticks are the West Nilevirus infection and Lyme disease. However,other vector-borne diseases in Indiana can beas serious as West Nile or Lyme. Humans get infected when ticks bite them. Disease is transmitted when the ticktakes a blood meal to complete the nextstage of its life cycle. Ticks must generallyremain attached for four to 36 hours totransmit disease. Checking your clothingand skin for ticks after being outside isimportant for preventing disease. Fortunately,all of these diseases can be treated successfullywith antibiotics. Mosquitoes transmit several viruses in Indiana that can cause infections fromminor illnesses to potentially deadlyencephalitis. In recent years, West Nileinfection has been the most common.However, mosquitoes also transmit St. Louisencephalitis, Eastern equine encephalitisand LaCrosse encephalitis viruses. There areno effective for these diseases orvaccines to prevent them. LaCrosse encephalitis occurs mainly in children younger than 16. Severe West Nileand St. Louis encephalitis infections occurmainly in people older than 50. All deaths inIndiana due to West Nile infection haveoccurred in elderly patients.Unwanted Pests Ticks and mosquitoes can be more than a nuisance by James Howell, DVM, MPH, DACVPM, Veterinary Epidemiologist, Indiana State Department of Health Although human cases are rare in Indiana, Eastern equine encephalitis infection can be deadly. Of all encephalitis infections, only rabies has a higher death rate. To minimize the risk of you and your family contracting these infectious diseases,it is important to make environmentalchanges and take personal steps to preventtick or mosquito bites. These include: >> Removing debris from around your home where ticks or their rodent hosts can hide. >> Keeping grass and weeds cut short and removing brush to reduce tick habitats. >> Eliminating mosquito-breeding areas like old tires, cans, bottles, flush bird baths and ornamental fountains. It is also importantto frequently empty and clean gutters. >> Wearing long-sleeved shirts and long pants when outdoors during hours of high mosquito activity \u2014 usually dawn and duskhours \u2014 and when entering tick habitats,such as wooded areas. After activity, examine your clothing and exposed skin for attachedticks. Remove any attached ticks immediately. (See box.) >>Using repellants on clothing and bare skin. DEET and Picaridin are commonly available in various strengths and are effectivelonger than others. The American Academyof Pediatricians recommends not using DEET on infants under eight weeks of age.Follow the label directions of any repellent toensure proper application and use. Safe Tick Removal 11..Using a clean pair of fine-tipped tweezers, firmly grasp the tick as close to your skin as possible. 22..With a steady motion, pull the tick's body away from your skin. Avoid crushing the tick's body. Donot be alarmed if the tick's mouth-parts remain in the skin \u2014 once themouthparts are separated from thetick's body, the tick can no longertransmit disease. If you accidentallycrush the tick, clean your skin withsoap and water or alcohol. 33.. Wash your skin around the tick bite with soap and water and apply an antiseptic and clean bandage. 44..Discard the tick in the trash. 55.. Do not use petroleum jelly, a hot match, nail polish or other products to remove a tick. 66..If you notice signs of infection, like redness, swelling or drainage around the tick bite, or if you develop symptoms of fever, chillsand/or a rash, see your health careprovider right away.involved in the outbreak. Relevant information, such as symptoms of the illness, the day theillness began and possible exposures, includingother ill people and foods eaten, is recorded.Epidemiologists may recommend that thepeople who are ill have testing to identify thespecific disease causing the outbreak. Now the work begins to \"reconstruct\" the outbreak occurrence. Epidemiologists reviewdata, laboratory results, inspection informationand other data to learn how the infectiousdisease was introduced to the population.They then implement the appropriate controlmeasures to contain the disease. Thesemeasures are designed to be the leastrestrictive but the most effective. Once the outbreak is over, the investigation is documented in an official report and sentto all agencies involved. This is an importantpiece of the puzzle since it serves as a publicrecord of the incident and a scientificrecord of the outbreak, which can be utilized in the future for similar investigations,teach ing and training of other public health officials and those interested in pursuingepidemiology.

However, she became acutely aware of health on a more personal level when, in1997, she was diagnosed with breast cancer.Yet, Holtkamp's experience with chemotherapyand radiation paled in comparison to whattranspired just six weeks after her treatmentswere completed. Her healthy, athletic 14-year-old daughter, Jolie Crider contracted bacterial meningitis. Holtkamp recalls her daughter crawling into bed with her after midnight. Afterwatching Jolie repeatedly vomit over threehours, Holtkamp took her to the doctor'soffice the next morning. Her intuition prompted her to ask if Jolie had meningitis. The teen's temperature was101 degrees \u2014 not excessively high \u2014 andher neck was checked for stiffness, a commonsymptom for meningitis. However, Jolie didnot show signs of a stiff or sore neck. Since the flu was going around, Jolie was pr escribed phenegrine, an anti-nausea medication, to calm her stomach. AA ttuurrnn ffoorr tthhee wwoorrssee After returning home, Jolie fell asleep. Later that night, she became nauseous again. Feeling worse with the onset of diarrhea and a hurtinghead, she was taken to the emergency room ofa nearby hospital where she immediately wastaken to an examination room. Her motherand father anxiously awaited a diagnosis.T urned Upside Down Shayla Holtkamp deals with the loss of her daughter tomeningitis by Deb Wezensky In most cases, the sad and tragic results of meningitis can be prevented. While it is afairly rare disease, 10 percent to 12 percent of the cases are fatal, according to theCenters for Disease Control and Prevention. Nearly 3,000 cases are reported every year in the United States. Among those who survivemeningococcal disease, about 20 percent sufferlong-term consequences, such as brain damage,kidney disease or hearing loss, the National Meningitis Association reports. Meningitis is an infection that causes inflammation of the membranes covering thebrain and spinal cord. Most cases of meningitisare viral infections, but bacterial and fungalinfections also can lead to meningitis. Infection is transmitted by direct contact with infected people through coughing orsneezing in someone's face, kissing or sharingutensils, drinking glasses or cigarettes. Dueto more crowded living conditions, teens andyoung adults may be at increased risk. Meningococcal disease often is misdiag- nosed as something less serious because early symptoms are similar to the flu. These mayinclude sudden onset of fever, headache anda stiff neck, as well as nausea, vomiting, sen-sitivity to light, altered mental status andseizures. After the disease has taken hold, a rashmay appear. If you experience two or more ofthese symptoms or the severe sudden onset of a symptom, seek medical care immediately. Viral meningitis is less severe than bacterial meningitis and occurs more frequently inMeningitis This rare but deadly disease ignites fear in parents and the public by Wayne Staggs, MS, Invasive Disease Epidemiologist, Indiana State Department of Health late summer and early fall. Bacterial meningitis is extremely serious and requires medical intervention. It can resultin death, brain damage or amputation.However, if identified promptly, it can betreated successfully with antibiotics. Fortunately, meningitis can be prevented. Vaccines can prevent some forms of bacterialmeningitis. Some of these vaccines arerequired for school or child care entry. Contact your health care provider or local health department to see if you or membersof your family should receive these vaccines.To check the immunization schedules, log onto the Centers for Disease Control andPrevention Web site at www.cdc.gov/vaccines/recs/schedules/default.htm.

EFFECTIVE INFECTION PREVENTIONThis time, her temperature registered at 97 degrees. Again, Holtkamp asked if her daughter might have meningitis. Again, the child's neck was examined, but shedid not appear to have classic symptoms for meningitis. To help with a diagnosis, thedoctor ordered blood work. In the meantime, Jolie's condition worsened. She appeared to sleep with her eyes open,recalls Holtkamp, who tried unsuccessfully toawaken her. By then, Holtkamp was convincedsomething was seriously wrong. Her presumption was on target. Results from the blood work indicated Jolie'swhite blood cell count was 38,000, farabove the nor mal range of 4,500 to 10,000 and indicative of a severe infection. Jolie's breathing became erratic, and a whirlwind of activity followed. She suffered aseizure. A CAT scan revealed she had swellingin the brain. Suddenly, Jolie's breathingstopped, and she was hooked to a ventilator. Jolie's parents struggled to take in what was happening to their daughter. Holtkamp remembers pleading with her daughter, \"Please don't leave don'tleave me.\" FFiigghhttiinngg ffoorr As Jolie's condition drastically worsened, she was Lifelined to Riley Hospital for Children, where she was given antibiotics. Because of the swelling in Jolie's brain, a spinal tap could not be performed, whichwould allow doctors to diagnose meningitis.Her movements were deemed as reflexive. At 4 a.m. \u2014 a little more than 24 hours after the onset of her illness \u2014 a test revealedJolie's brain showed no activity. A second testconfirmed the teen, who played baseball justdays earlier, was kept alive solely by life support. Holtkamp crawled into bed with her daugh ter to assure her it was OK for her to go to be with God. And Jolie was gone, she says. The following day, tests confirmed Jolie had died from bacterial meningitis. Her parents, as a part of coming to terms with Jolie's death, both frequently speak toIndiana University students who enrolled ina course on Death and Dying. Holtkamp says she's committed to live a purposeful life in honor of her daughter. Your body's main line of defenseagainst infectious diseases is yourimmune system. Made up of white blood cells and other tissues, your immunesystem protects your body from organismsthat cause disease. The immune system guards your body against invading organisms and attacksinfections. It also \"remembers\" the infectionsto which you are exposed through illness orvaccination to protect you from becoming illfrom these same organisms later in life. Like any other body system, however, it is important to keep your immune systemhealthy so it functions properly. Thosewhose immune systems are weakened due toyouth or old age, certain diseases or geneticdisorders should be especially careful to keepthe immune system strong. These six tips can help you keep your immune system armed and ready: 11.. EEaatt aa bbaallaanncceedd ddiieett..Many fruits and vegetables contain compounds that strengthen your immune system.

EFFECTIVE INFECTION PREVENTIONAs a savvy health care consumer, you value credible information fromreliable sources. How do you know which sources are trustworthy? The followingtips and recommendations will help you findsources that will allow you to make soundhealth care decisions for you and your family. > Credibility: Perhaps the most important consideration when determining thequality of an article is who or what organizationwrote the information. Is the source consideredan authority in the topic? Although notfoolproof, look for Web site addresses ending in.org, .edu and .gov. These generally indicate anot-for-profit status and potentially moreobjective, less biased information. > Funding reliability: Does the article or Web site indicate who paid for the publication? If someone benefits from you reading the publication, there is a higherlikelihood the information may be biased --purposefully trying to influence you in a spe-cific way. Funding sources, such as not-for-profit funding and federal/state grants, typi-cally reduce the potential for bias. > Age of timely information: Much has been learned about medicine andhealth in r ecent decades, so it is important touse current information. However, beware of \"latest study shows\"-type articles. One studyis just that: one study. T rustworthy healthinformation r ests firmly on a foundation of many studies -- not just one or two. Thelatest studies are interesting but most oftenshould not be the basis of personal healthchoices. It is also a good idea to get medicalinformation from more than one site. Remember, health information found on the Internet should not replace the informationgiven by your health care provider. Ask yourdoctor for reliable sites that can supplementyour care.
