Th e vaccine is given as a si ngle intramuscular injection but must be reconstituted prior to administration. Other meningococcal vaccines include Menactra\u00ae (also a quadrivalent vaccine) and Menomune\u00ae (a polysaccharide vaccine). In randomized trials, Menveo\u00ae has been shown to induce greater immunogenicity response and proven to be safe and tolerable in different age groups when compared to Menactra\u00ae. However, the clinical relevance of higher post -vaccination immune response is unknown. The most common adverse reactions reported wit h Menveo\u00ae are injection site reactions, headaches, malaise and myalgias. Side effects are similar are similar to other meningococcal vaccines , except for subjects ages 11 -18 reported lower injection site reactions with Menveo\u00ae compared to Menactra\u00ae. Co -administration with other vaccines, including Boostrix\u00ae and Gardasil\u00ae has been shown to be safe and efficacious as well. Based on available clinical data, lower comparative cost, and tolerable side effect profile of Menveo\u00ae, the recommendation is to ADD Menv eo to the formulary. In addition, it is recommended that Menactra\u00ae be removed from the formulary. However, Menomune\u00ae should remain on formulary because it is the preferred vaccine in patients greater than 55 years of age. Clinical Indication1-8 Menveo\u00ae is indicated for prevention of invasive meningococcal disease caused by Neisseria meningitidis serogroups A, C, Y, and W -135 in people 2 to 55 years of age. However, it does not prevent N. meningitidis serogroup B infections. The other meningococcal vacc ines have similar indications with somewhat different age ranges (see Table 1 for details) . The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommends Menveo\u00ae or Menactra\u00ae in the following populations: all persons aged 11 -18 years and individuals 2-55 years of age at increased risk for meningococcal disease. High risk groups include: college freshmen living in dormitories, individuals routinely exposed to isolates of N. meningitidis , military recruits, people traveling or living in areas where meningococcal disease is endemic or epidemic, those who have persistent complement component deficiencies and with anatomic or functional asplenia. Table 1 outlines the FDA -approved age groups for the available meningococcal vaccines.

Serogroups A, B, C, Y and W -135 are responsible for almost all invasive meningococcal infections worldwide. Vaccination with Menveo\u00ae results in the production of serum bactericidal antibodies that are protective against meningococcal disease caused from all the serogroups , with the exception of serogroup B. Menactra\u00ae is a quadrivalent conjugated vaccine that offers protection to the same serogroups as Menveo\u00ae. In contrast, Menomune\u00ae is a polysaccharide vaccine and contains purified bacterial capsular polysaccharides to e ach of the same 4 serogroups as Menveo\u00ae. Dosing and Administration Regimen1,2,8 and MenCYW -135 liquid conjugate, that must be reconstituted together before administration. The entire contents of the MEnCYw -135 liquid vial should be withdrawn using a syringe and then injected into the MenA vial. Afterwards, the reconstituted MenA vial should be inverted and shaken to dissolve the vaccine. Administer the 0.5mL reconstituted vacc ine intramuscularly, preferably in the deltoid. The reconstituted solution should be colorless, clear solution free from any visible foreign particles. Once reconstituted, the vaccine should be administered immediately, but can be stored at or below 25\u00ba C for up to 8 hours.

In contrast, Menactra\u00ae can be administered from single dose vials. Warnings and Precautions1,2,7,8 Syncope . Reports of syncope associated with se izure -like movements have been reported. Patients should be monitored for 15 minutes after vaccine administration. Altered immunocompetence . Menveo\u00ae has not been shown to be safe in immuno -compromised patients. The desired immune response may not be ach ieved if Menveo\u00ae is administered in immuno -compromised patients or in people receiving immunosuppressive therapy. Guillain -Barre Syndrome (GBS). There are currently insufficient data to determine the potential risk of GBS in patients receiving Menveo\u00ae . Ho wever, GBS has been reported in patients who received Menactra and post marketing experience suggest a potential increase risk. Bleeding disorders . Patients with bleeding disorders, on anticoagulant therapy should not be vaccinated with Menveo\u00ae unless the benefits outweigh the risks. Bleeding disorders have not been addressed with the other two vaccines. Use in Pregnancy/Lactation1,2,8 There are no data from well -controlled studies in pregnant women. However, reproduction studies in female rabbits at dos es 20 times greater than doses used in human have not shown any evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus. As a result, assessment of risks versus benefits should be taken when considering the administration of Menveo\u00ae to a pregnant woman. Like wise, there are no animal studies or well controlled studies for Menactra\u00ae and Menomune\u00ae so safety and efficacy has not been established. Caution should also be taken when administering to pregnant or lactating women. Additionally, it is unknown if all t hree meningococcal vaccines are excreted in human break milk. Caution should be taken when this vaccine is administered to nursing mothers. Contraindications1 Contraindications include any previous allergic reaction to a dose of Menveo\u00ae, any component of the vaccine or to a CRM 197 diptheroid toxoid or meningococcal -containing vaccine. Drug Interactions1,2,6,7 Concomitant Administration with other vaccines. It is not recommended to mix Menveo\u00ae or any of its components with other vaccines or diluents , which is similar for the other two vaccines . Menveo\u00ae has not been adequately studied in combination with other childhood vaccines in children ages 2 to 10 years. In a clinical trial with adolescents, the concurrent administration of Menveo\u00ae with Boostrix\u00ae and Gardasil\u00ae resulted in no significant difference in immune response compared to Menveo\u00ae given alone. In contrast, Menactra\u00ae has been studied with childhood vaccines and had minimal effects on antibody responses. Menactra\u00ae was also shown to be safely a dministered with tetanus and diphtheria toxoid and Typhim Vi vaccines. There are no safety and immunogenicity data on concurrent administration of other vaccines with Menomune\u00ae. Immunosuppressive therapies. The immunogenicity of all three meningococcal vaccines has not been adequately studied in patients receiving immunosuppressive therapies (e.g. irradiation, alkylating agents, corticosteroids). Adverse Effects1,2,8 The most common adverse events observed in children 2 -10 years of age are injection s ite In comparison, patients age 11 -55 years experienced the following side effects more frequently: injection site pain (41%), headache (30%), myalgia (18%), malaise (16%), and nausea (10%). RISK MANAGEMENT/QUALITY IMPROVEMENT WORK PRODUCT DO NOT PLACE IN MEDICAL RECORD CONFIDENTIAL PURSUANT TO RCW 4.24.240 -250 AND 70.41.200 Page 4 of 11 The side effect profile of Menveo\u00ae is similar to Menactra \u00ae with the exception of lower injection site pain observed in patients 11 to 18 years of age. Adverse events following concomitant vaccine administration: The safety of Menveo\u00ae administered concurrently with Boostrix\u00ae and Gardasil\u00ae has been studied in one single center clinical trial. Menveo\u00ae was well tolerated amongst patients who concomitantly received Gardasil\u00ae and Boostrix\u00ae and experienc ed similar rates of malaise (25% vs 20%), myalgias (27% vs as those who received Menveo\u00ae alone, respectively. Clinical Trials1,4-14 Several clinical trials have compared Menveo\u00ae to Menactra\u00ae in various age populations. The tr ials are discussed and summarized below. Manufacturer Clinical Trials: The immunogenicity of Menveo\u00ae in subjects aged 2 -55 years was investigated by the manufacturer in two randomized, multicenter, active controlled clinical trials evaluating the serum anticapsular bactericidal antibody those of Menactra\u00ae (n=2,037). A single dose of Menveo\u00ae provided a non -inferior seroresponse in children 2 -5 years of age in all serogroups in comparison to Menactra\u00ae with the exception of serogroup A. In study subjects age 11 -55 years, Menveo\u00ae was demonstrated to be non -inferior in achieving similar bactericidal antibody responses to Menactra\u00ae in all four serogroups. Please refer to the appendix for furt her information. Other Clinical Trials: Other clinical trials have examined Menveo\u00ae's safety and immunogenicity in different age populations. Halperin and colleagues examined the clinical effects of Menveo\u00ae versus Menactra\u00ae in 2 ,907 children aged 2 -10 ye ars old. Menveo\u00ae was statistically superior versus Menactra\u00ae in eliciting a higher seroresponse for serogroups W and Y and was non -inferior for group C in both age groups. However, group A seroresponse after Menveo\u00ae (72%, 77%) administration did not me et non-inferiority criterion compared to Menactra\u00ae (77%, 83%) for both age groups 2 -5 and 6 -10 years, respectively. However for the combined aged group 2 -10 years, non -inferiority was achieved for all four serogroups and Menveo\u00ae was shown to be statistically superior for groups C, W -135 and Y. However, the clinical significance of lower immune responses to serogroup A is unclear since the majority of meningococcal disease in the United States are caused by serogroups B,C, and Y, with each causing about a thir d of the cases. Furthermore, Jackson et al also compared the safety and immunogenicity of Menveo\u00ae against Menactra\u00ae in a phase III, randomized, observer -blind trial consisting of 2 ,170 subjects 11 -18 years of age. Subjects who received Menveo\u00ae had statis tically superior hSBA geometric greater titers 1:8 and proportion of seroresponders for serogroups A, W -135 and Y and was determined to be non -inferior for group C seroresponse compared to Menactra\u00ae. Both groups experienced similar side effects. Lastly, Reisinger et al demonstrated Menveo\u00ae to be s uperior to Menactra\u00ae for the proportions of patients who achieved a seroresponse against serogroups C (67% vs 58%), W Y (56% and 40%) . In addition, serogroups and titers Although the hSBA GMT to serogroup A was in comparison to Menactra\u00ae, the GMTs induced from Menveo\u00ae was statistically superior than Menactra\u00ae for serogroups C (52 vs 32 ), W-135 (111 vs 69) and Y (44 vs 21 ). Both vaccines had similar tolerability profiles. The immunogenicity of Menveo\u00ae may persist up to 12 -22 months accordingly to some studies but further studies are needed to evaluate the long term immune protection from a single dose of Menveo\u00ae.

Overall annual financial impact to UW Medicine Meningococcal vaccines are supplied by the state based on the predicted strain for the year. Since th e majority of vaccines are administered in the outpatient clinics, it has been difficult to trace the frequency of vaccine administration. Discussion Menveo\u00ae is a new quadrivalent oligo saccharide conjugated meningococcal vaccine that is FDA approved for the prevention of invasive meningococcal disease caused by Neisseria meningitidis serogroups A, C, Y, and W -135. Currently, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practice (ACIP) recommends vaccination with Menactra\u00ae or Menveo\u00ae for adults 55 years of ag e and Menomune\u00ae is preferred for those over 55 years of age. The closest comparator formulary medication to Menveo\u00ae is Menactra\u00ae. Menveo\u00ae has a greater immunogenicity response compared to Menactra\u00ae with similar side effect profiles, which includes inject ion site pain, headaches, myalgias and malaise. Although the clinical significance of higher post -vaccination immune response is unknown, review of the available clinical data supports Menveo\u00ae as a non-inferior vaccine to Menactra\u00ae . Additionally, Menveo\u00ae has been shown to be safe when co -administered with other vaccines such as Boostrix\u00ae and Gardasil\u00ae. Therefore, it can replace Menactra\u00ae as a lower cost formulary agent. Recommendation The recommendation is to ADD Menveo\u00ae to formulary as the preferred m eningococcal vaccine for patients aged 2 -55 years old. In addition, it is recommended that Menactra\u00ae be removed from the formulary. Menomune\u00ae should remain on formulary as the preferred vaccine in patients greater than 55 years of age.
