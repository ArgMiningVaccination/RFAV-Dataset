A person with a weak immune system may be more prone to frequent infections, illness, increased risk of cancer, and unhealthy ageing. White blood cells, antibodies, and other components, including organs and lymph nodes, make up the body's immune system. Many disorders can weaken the immune system and cause a person to become immunocompromised. These disorders can range from mild to severe. Some are present from birth, while others result from environmental factors. The primary symptom of a weakened immune system is susceptibility to infection. A person with a weakened immune system is likely to get infections more frequently than most other people, and these illnesses might be more severe or harder to treat. These individuals may also find themselves dealing with an infection that a person with a stronger immune system would not get.

It is a coenzyme found in all living cells and has even been called an anti-aging molecule because of its many important roles in promoting health and prolonging lifespan. This powerful molecule has a lot of potential for new therapeutic opportunities. Studies have shown that it can help battle many aging and chronic conditions on the human body and brain. NAD regulates the inflammatory response in immune and non-immune cells through Sirtuins. Epigenetic regulation of histones and non-histone proteins is induced by sirtuins and is essential for the development, reprogramming, and differentiation of the immune system and its related pathologies. Weber IV Laser Therapy Weber Intravenous (IV) Laser Therapy offers advanced medically proven non-drug therapy for chronic diseases that strengthens the immune system and optimizes metabolism. It is a medically proven therapy that is simple, comfortable and has no negative side effects. IV Laser therapy can provide a boost to aid in immunological adaptation and stimulate immune responses. A secondary benefit of treating various ailments with therapeutic laser is that each patient's immune system is also being stimulated due to the global effects that occur coincidently with laser therapy. We can further target our treatment protocols toward the immune system by stimulating the lymph nodes or spleen, for example, to amplify the effect on the immune system. Therapeutic laser can be a safe, effective immunomodulator that can be applied to patients of all ages with a wide variety of clinical conditions. IV Oxygen Therapy Intravenous oxygen infusion is used in complementary medicine to fight inflammatory disorders and repeated application of this therapeutic method leads to an increase in immune activity in the peripheral blood. Through oxyvenation therapy, the body's own substances (prostaglandins) are produced by the body, which are directed against inflammation in the body and thus have a self-healing effect. Inflammations in the body can be treated by the oxyvenation method without the side effects of drugs. As an additional therapy in a immune boosting treatment, oxygen therapy (oxyvenation) favours the opening of the small capillary vessels. In this way, oxyvenation increases the effect of infusions by facilitating the uptake of substances by the cells. We use the effect of oxyvenation to increase the efficiency of various immune boosting therapies. Thymus Peptide Injections The thymus gland is at the center of our immune system. The function of the thymus is to produce and \"educate\" T-lymphocytes (T cells). These cells are critical to the adaptive immune system. During our life times the thymus changes its size and its function. It is largest and most active in newborns, infants. By the early teenage years, the thymus begins to reduce in size and the tissue of thymus is replaced by fatty tissue. The cellular army of the immune system is responsible for vigilance against chronic viruses, fungi, yeast, and parasitic infections as well as aspects of healthy aging. Thymus extracts have been used clinically in a variety of ways involving some of these conditions. They have been used orally and as injectables; by themselves and in combination with other therapeutics. Thymus extracts have been used to treat severe and chronic allergies involving the respiratory tract and skin as well as in severe acute and chronic infectious diseases. Vit D3 Injection (IM) Vitamin D helps our immune systems stay balanced during the cold and flu season, and serve as a pharmacy resource. There are Vitamin D receptors and activating enzymes on the surfaces of all White Blood Cells. The role that vitamin D plays in keeping the immune system healthy is very complex because the immune system has to be perfectly balanced. If there is too much stimulation, autoimmune diseases can set in. If there is not enough immune system activity, frequent infections can occur. Low levels of vitamin D have been linked with both extremes, and low levels of vitamin D have been associated with worsening autoimmune diseases. Low levels of vitamin D are not the underlying cause of the autoimmune disease, but low levels of vitamin D can make autoimmune disease states worse.1 Low levels of vitamin D have also been associated with frequent infections. In 2009, the National Institute of Health warned that low vitamin D levels are associated with frequent colds and influenza.
