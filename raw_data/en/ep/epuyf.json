Acute pain is 'normal' pain, it is felt when hurting a toe, breaking a bone, having a toothache, or walking after an extensive surgical operation. Chronic pain is a 'pain illness', it is felt day after day, month after month, and seems impossible to heal. In general, physicians are more comfortable treating acute pain, which usually is caused by soft tissue damage, infection and/or inflammation among other causes. It is usually treated simultaneously with [pharmaceuticals](/index.php/Pharmaceuticals), commonly [analgesics](/index.php/Analgesics), or appropriate techniques for removing the cause and for controlling the pain sensation. The failure to treat acute pain properly may lead to chronic pain in some cases. [[1]](#cite_note-1) General physicians have only elementary training in [chronic pain](/index.php/Chronic_pain) management. Often, patients suffering from it are referred to various medical specialists. Though usually caused by an injury, an operation, or an obvious illness, chronic pain may as well have no apparent cause, or may be caused by a developing illness or imbalance. This disorder can trigger multiple psychological problems that confound both patient and health care providers, leading to various differential diagnoses and to patient's feelings of helplessness and hopelessness. Multidisciplinary pain clinics are growing in number since a few decades. Anesthesia [Anesthesia](/index.php/Anesthesia) is the condition of having the feeling of pain and other sensations blocked by drugs that induces a lack of awareness. It may be a total or a minimal lack of awareness throughout the body (i.e. general anesthesia), or a lack of awareness in a part of the body (i.e. regional or local anesthesia). Analgesia [Analgesia](/index.php/Analgesia) is an alteration of the sense of pain without loss of consciousness. The body possesses an [endogenous](/index.php/Endogenous) analgesia system, which can be supplemented with painkillers or [analgesic drugs](/index.php/Analgesic) to regulate [nociception](/index.php/Nociception) and pain. Analgesia may occur in the central nervous system or in peripheral nerves and nociceptors. The perception of pain can also be modified by the body according to the [gate control theory of pain](/index.php/Gate_control_theory_of_pain). The endogenous central analgesia system is mediated by 3 major components : the [periaquaductal grey matter](/index.php/Periaquaductal_grey_matter), the [nucleus within the [dorsal horns](/index.php/Dorsal_horn) of the spinal cord, which act to inhibit nociception-transmitting neurons also located in the spinal dorsal horn. The peripheral regulation consists of several different types of [opioid receptors](/index.php/Opioid_receptor) that are activated in response to the binding of the body's [endorphins](/index.php/Endorphin). These receptors, which exist in a variety of areas in the body, inhibit firing of neurons that would otherwise be stimulated to do so by nociceptors. The [gate control theory of pain](/index.php/Gate_control_theory_of_pain) postulates that nociception is \"gated\" by non-noxious stimuli such as vibration. Thus, rubbing a bumped knee seems to relieve pain by preventing its transmission to the brain. Pain is also \"gated\" by signals that descend from the brain to the spinal cord to suppress (and in other cases enhance) incoming nociceptive information. Complementary and alternative medicine A survey of American adults found pain was the most common reason that people use [complementary and alternative medicine](/index.php/Complementary_and_alternative_medicine). [Traditional Chinese medicine](/index.php/Traditional_Chinese_medicine) views pain as a 'blocked' [qi](/index.php/Qi), akin to [electrical resistance](/index.php/Electrical_resistance), with treatments such as [acupunctureclaimed](/index.php/Acupuncture) as more effective for nontraumatic pain than [traumatic](/index.php/Physical_trauma) pain. Although the mechanism is not fully understood, acupuncture may stimulate the release of large quantities of endogenous [opioids](/index.php/Opioid). [[2]](#cite_note-2) Pain treatment may be sought through the of [nutritional supplements](/index.php/Nutritional_supplement) as diverse perceptional techniques provoking altered states of consciousness have proven to be of important help in the management of all types of pain. [[3]](#cite_note-3) Some kinds of physical manipulation or exercise are showing interesting results as well.

The chemical found in chili peppers that causes those feelings is capsaicin (pronounced cap-SAY-sin), and it works its unique magic by grabbing onto receptors scattered along the surface of sensitive nerve cells in the mouth. In 1997, scientists at the University of California at San Francisco discovered a gene for a capsaicin receptor, called the vanilloid receptor. Once in contact with capsaicin, vanilloid receptors open and pain signals are sent from the peripheral nociceptor and through central nervous system circuits to the brain. Investigators have also learned that this receptor plays a role in the burning type of pain commonly associated with heat, such as the kind you experience when you touch your finger to a hot stove. The vanilloid receptor functions as a sort of \"ouch gateway,\" enabling us to detect burning hot pain, whether it originates from a 3-alarm habanera chili or from a stove burner. Capsaicin is currently available as a prescription or over-the-counter cream for the treatment of a number of pain conditions, such as shingles. It works by reducing the amount of substance P found in nerve endings and interferes with the transmission of pain signals to the brain. Individuals can become desensitized to the compound, however, perhaps because of long-term damage to nerve tissue. Some individuals find the burning sensation they experience when using capsaicin cream to be intolerable, especially when they are already suffering from a painful condition, such as postherpetic neuralgia. Soon, however, better treatments that relieve pain by blocking vanilloid receptors may arrive in drugstores. Marijuana As a painkiller, marijuana or, by its Latin name, cannabis, continues to remain highly controversial. In the eyes of many individuals campaigning on its behalf, marijuana rightfully belongs with other pain remedies. In fact, for many years, it was sold under highly controlled conditions in cigarette form by the Federal government for just that purpose. In 1997, the National Institutes of Health held a workshop to discuss research on the possible therapeutic uses for smoked marijuana. Panel members from a number of fields reviewed published research and heard presentations from pain experts. The panel members concluded that, because there are too few scientific studies to prove marijuana's therapeutic utility for certain conditions, additional research is needed. There is evidence, however, that receptors to which marijuana binds are found in many brain regions that process information that can produce pain. Nerve Blocks Nerve blocks may involve local anesthesia, regional anesthesia or analgesia, or surgery; dentists routinely use them for traditional dental procedures. Nerve blocks can also be used to prevent or even diagnose pain. In the case of a local nerve block, any one of a number of local anesthetics may be used; the names of these compounds, such as lidocaine or novocaine, usually have an aine ending. Regional blocks affect a larger area of the body. Nerve blocks may also take the form of what is commonly called an epidural, in which a drug is administered into the space between the spine's protective covering (the dura) and the spinal column. This procedure is most well known for its use during childbirth. Morphine and methadone are opioid narcotics (such drugs end in ine or one) that are sometimes used for regional analgesia and are administered as an injection. Neurolytic blocks employ injection of chemical agents such as alcohol, phenol, or glycerol to block pain messages and are most often used to treat cancer pain or to block pain in the cranial nerves. In some cases, a drug called guanethidine is administered intravenously in order to accomplish the block. Surgical blocks are performed on cranial, peripheral, or sympathetic nerves. They are most often done to relieve the pain of cancer and extreme facial pain, such as that experienced with trigeminal neuralgia. There are several different types of surgical nerve blocks and they are not without problems and complications. Nerve blocks can cause muscle paralysis and, in many cases, result in at least partial numbness. For that reason, the procedure should be reserved for a select group of patients and should only be performed by skilled surgeons. Types of surgical nerve blocks include: - Neurectomy (including peripheral neurectomy) in which a damaged peripheral nerve is destroyed. - Spinal dorsal rhizotomy in which the surgeon cuts the root or rootlets of one or more of the nerves radiating from the spine. Other rhizotomy procedures include cranial rhizotomy and trigeminal rhizotomy, performed as a treatment for extreme facial pain or for the pain of cancer. - Sympathectomy, also called sympathetic blockade, in which a drug or an agent such as guanethidine is used to eliminate pain in a specific area (a limb, for example). The procedure is also done for cardiac pain, vascular disease pain, the pain of reflex sympathetic dystrophy syndrome, and other conditions. The term takes its name from the sympathetic nervous system and may involve, for example, cutting a nerve that controls contraction of one or more arteries.
