Comprehensive health care also involves screening and support for mental health and alcohol, tobacco, and other substance use ( Box 1 ). MSM may experience stigma, discrimination, and family or community rejection related to their sexuality and gender expression. Such nega - tive experiences can make MSM reluctant to seek health care or engage openly with providers, par - ticularly if they have experienced, or anticipate, judgment or discrimination in clinical settings.1,2 14Back to page 13 City Health InformationVolume 42 (2023) Across studies, 10% to 55% of MSM in the Unit - ed States (US) did not tell their medical provider they have sex with men, and Latino and Black MSM were less likely to disclose than White MSM.3,4 For Black MSM in particular, engagement in care can be undermined by experiences of racial discrimination that create mistrust of med - ical providers or institutions.5-7 To ensure access to care, provide a welcoming clinical approach and comprehensive health care to all MSM. Reach out to patients who may have been delayed in getting routine care during the COVID-19 pandemic, including recommended HIV and STI screenings, other screenings, and vaccinations.WELCOME AND AFFIRM MEN WHO HAVE SEX WITH MEN A clinical approach that accepts and openly supports cisgender and transgender MSM can make it easier for them to seek care and have honest conversations about their sexual health and challenges to well-being ( Box 28-10). Patients generally want to discuss their sexual health, but many prefer their providers raise the issue.11 Men's disclosure of sex with men is essential for providing comprehensive care and appro - priate clinic-based interventions ( Box 3 ). Do not assume you can determine patients' sexual practices and identity by how they look, speak, or act. When engaging patients, explain the medical BOX 1.

CREATE A WELCOMING ENVIRONMENT8-10 To create an LGBTQ-friendly practice Refer to patients by the name and pronouns they use Display images and messages that celebrate LGBTQ health and pride Post the NYC LGBTQ Health Care Bill of Rights and a confidentiality statement Recognize patients' chosen families, not just their legal family members or partners Ensure that all providers and frontline staff receive regular trainings on implicit bias, MSM health, and how to be respect - ful to LGBTQ patients ( to page 13 City Health InformationVolume 42 (2023) BOX 3. FACILITATE MEN'S DISCLOSURE OF SEX WITH MEN Offer patients multiple opportunities to disclose the genders of their sexual partners at patient registration during the in-person baseline sexual history at follow-up visits ( \"Has anything in your sex life changed since your last visit?\" ) Avoid judging or stigmatizing patients' sexual practices See Take a Sexual History From All Patients (above) Invite patients to express their identities Ask patients, and include in their electronic medical record, their Name and pronouns, which may not match the name or gender on their insurance information or official identifica - tion Gender identity and sex assigned at birth, which establish whether they are cisgender, transgender, or identify as other than a woman or man Sexual orientation (eg, gay, bisexual, straight, or another identity) Refer patients who are reluctant to discuss their sexual practices to clinics with expertise serving LGBTQ persons These include New York City Sexual Health Clinics LGBTQ, lesbian, questioningneed for asking sensitive questions and ensure confidentiality (see Take a Sexual History From All Patients , below). UNDERSTAND YOUR PATIENT'S PRIORITIES Health and wellness may not be everyone's priority. Poverty and lack of social support can undermine safety, stable housing, and engage - ment in medical care. Some men may exchange sex for money, drugs, a place to stay, or other basic needs. To understand a patient's hierarchy of needs, ask: \"What are your main priorities in life right now? What are your priorities for your health?\" ADDRESS SPECIFIC BARRIERS TO CARE A culturally responsive clinical approach can especially benefit men of color, immigrants, transgender men, adolescents, and older men (Boxes 4-89,12-29). Be aware of how discrimination based on a patient's race, ethnicity, age, social class, sexuality, and gender identity and expres - sion can intersect and fuel health inequities. TAKE A SEXUAL HISTORY FROM ALL PATIENTS Knowing the patient's sexual history ( Boxes 9,24,30-32 page 17, and 10,31 page 18) guides: screening for HIV and other STIs, BOX 4.

Ensure that men of color receive full access to effective care In New York City, fewer Latino and Black men than White men take preexposure prophylaxis to prevent HIV, in part because providers may be less willing to discuss preexposure prophylaxis or prescribe it to them Question stereotypes that could lead you to limit patients' access to care Be aware that higher numbers of HIV diagnoses among Latino and Black men who have sex with men are not ex - plained by racial/ethnic differences in condom use or number of sex partners but by having sex in networks with higher prevalence of HIV and other sexually transmitted infections and with partners who are less likely to be engaged in HIV care Use clinic resources to help address patients' barriers to care Assist patients in getting health insurance, financial assistance for medications and clinical services, stable housing, food assistance, and substance use and mental health care ( Resources )Continued on page 1816Back to page 13 City Health InformationBOX 5. ADDRESS BARRIERS TO CARE FOR IMMIGRANT MEN WHO HAVE SEX WITH MEN Immigration status, language barriers, social isolation, poverty, past trauma, and lack of familiarity with local sexual cultures may challenge the well-being of immigrant men who have sex with men Employ patient navigators who are fluent in the languages your patients speak and have expertise in engaging immi - grants around their health, sexuality, and gender identity Provide intake forms and educational materials in multiple languages Inform patients that in New York they may be eligible for health insurance at low or no cost and that they can get pri - mary care, specialty care, mental health care, immunizations, and sexual health services without insurance (see Health Insurance and Care Options for Immigrants ) BOX 6. ADDRESS BARRIERS TO CARE FOR TRANSGENDER MEN WHO HAVE SEX WITH MEN19-22 Transgender people may avoid medical care if they fear mistreatment or a provider's lack of experience with transgender health Train staff on transgender health ( Resources ) Refer to all patients by the names and pronouns they use Promote engagement in care by providing gender-affirming hormone therapy Provide comprehensive sexual health care to transgender MSM Testosterone use can lead to new sexual practices and attractions, including sex with cisgender men that increase the need for frequent HIV and STI testing and access to HIV prevention options such as PrEP Counsel men with a functioning uterus and ovaries that they can become pregnant if they have receptive vaginal-penile sex without the use of contraception, even if they have begun taking testosterone Discuss the wide range of contraceptive options and the patient's concerns with specific methods Encourage transgender men with vaginal dryness (eg, from testosterone use) to use lubricant to avoid discomfort or injury during vaginal sex MSM, men who have sex with men; PrEP, preexposure prophylaxis; STI, sexually transmitted infectionVolume 42 (2023) BOX 7. ADDRESS BARRIERS TO CARE FOR ADOLESCENT BOYS WHO HAVE SAME-SEX ATTRACTION23-27 Young MSM may not be comfortable discussing their sexuality but can greatly benefit from supportive sexual health care and counseling During clinic visits, spend time alone with adolescent patients beginning at age 12 years. Take a sexual history when par - ents or guardians are not present Tell patients that what they discuss with you and the services they receive will be kept confidential (with the exception of possible child abuse or neglect) Encourage adolescent boys with same-sex attraction or same-sex partners to establish healthy practices, including consis - tent condom use; regular testing for HIV and other STIs; and taking PrEP or, if needed, emergency PEP to prevent HIV Inform adolescents that in New York State they do not need parental or guardian consent to receive: HPV vaccination HIV and STI testing and treatment PrEP or emergency PEP to prevent HIV Inform patients that they can request that their health insurance plan send benefits documents to an address other than the main policyholder's Be vigilant for signs that people seeking health care\u2014including adolescents and young adults\u2014may be victims of human trafficking HPV, human papillomavirus; MSM, men who PrEP, preexposure prophylaxis; STI, sexually transmitted infectioninfection17Back to page 13 City Health InformationVolume 42 (2023) BOX 8. ADDRESS BARRIERS TO CARE FOR OLDER MEN WHO HAVE SEX WITH MEN28,29 Older MSM may have unique medical and social needs Take a sexual history, regardless of age Recognize that erectile dysfunction can increase with age and comorbid illness, making condom use more difficult Ask about social ties and support. Older LGBTQ adults are more likely than other older adults to live alone Refer patients aged 60 years and older to a SAGE drop-in center Address possible trauma ( Box 16 ) among older MSM who have had their sexuality criminalized or treated as a mental illness or who survived the worst years of the HIV epidemic LGBTQ, lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer or questioning; MSM, men who have sex with men BOX 9. TAKING A SEXUAL HISTORY24,30-32 1. Explain to the patient why you are asking about their sex life \"I ask all my patients about their sexual health so they can get the screenings, treatment, and vaccinations they need.\" 2. Ask a broad opening question that allows the patient to help lead the discussion \"Can you tell me a little bit about your sex life?\" 3. As needed, follow-up with specific questions adapted from the CDC's \"5 Ps\" As needed, follow-up with specific questions adapted from the CDC's \"5 Ps\" Partners and their genders \"Do you have a main partner?\" \"Do you have other partners?\" \"What are your partners' genders?\" Practices and need for screening \"What types of sex do you have?\" \"Anal?

DISCUSS SEXUAL PLEASURE AND FUNCTION Make sexual pleasure and function a part of the sexual history ( Box 1124,33). A clinical approach that helps reduce stigma and anxiety around sex between men can increase pleasure. ADDRESS HIV AND OTHER SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED INFECTIONS HIV and other STIs remain a major health concern for MSM. In 2021, around 750 cisgen - der MSM in NYC were newly diagnosed with HIV, 80% of whom were Latino or Black.17 Be- tween 2017 and 2021 in NYC, viral suppression increased in people living with HIV; use of PrEP and emergency PEP to prevent HIV expanded; and new HIV diagnoses among MSM decreased 39%.34-36 However, self-reported condom use has fallen among men who have sex with men in NYC and diagnoses of other STIs have been increasing among men, which may reflect both less frequent condom use and more routine STI screening.37,38 In 2020, COVID-19 disruptions reduced access to HIV testing and may have temporarily slowed growth in PrEP and PEP use.36,39 HIV typically transmits between cisgender men during anal sex, most easily from the insertive (top) partner to the receptive (bottom) partner.40 Consistent condom use remains an effective way to prevent HIV, other STIs, and pregnancy. However, not all men regularly use condoms or can be sure their partners will use them. Men may prefer the feeling of sex without condoms, and difficulty maintaining an erection can also undermine condom use. Counsel patients about different ways to prevent HIV and STIs, including condoms, regular HIV and STI testing, and an - tiretroviral medications to treat or prevent HIV (Boxes 12-1424,39,41-44). HIV testing Routine testing allows for prompt diagnosis and treatment of a new HIV infection. A nega -tive test result is an opportunity to discuss the patient's strategy for preventing HIV, which may include taking PrEP or using PEP in an emer - gency. Laboratory-based antigen/antibody tests can detect HIV earlier than oral or rapid tests.45 Inform reluctant patients about options for HIV Volume 42 (2023) BOX 10. BEST PRACTICES IN SEXUAL HISTORY-TAKING31 Emphasize the benefit of a healthy sex life Instead of focusing on \"risky behaviors\" and disease Say: \"I'd like to help you have a happy and healthy sex life.\" Avoid questions that imply judgment or a right answer Instead of asking whether the patient uses con - doms Ask: \"How do you protect yourself from HIV and other STIs?\" Avoid a battery of questions If a man reports having sex with multiple male part - ners, you do not need to ask how many partners he has had in the last X months Use patients' own terms for their anatomy and sexual practices A transgender man may prefer the term \"front sex\" instead of \"vaginal sex\" or \"chest\" instead of \"breasts\" Ask for a brief update at follow-up visits Ask: \"Has anything in your sex life changed since your last visit?\" BOX 11. DISCUSSING SEXUAL PLEASURE AND FUNCTION24,33 To promote pleasure and reduce the stigma and anxiety associated with sex between men Counsel patients without appearing to judge their sexual practices Discuss options for reducing the risk of HIV and other STIs ( Box 12 ) Inform patients that people with an undetectable HIV viral load cannot pass HIV through sex ( Box 14 ) Investigate reports of erectile dysfunction, which may be associated with comorbid illness, age, or certain medications Medications to address erectile dysfunction may be appropriate Investigate reports of pain or lack of pleasure during anal sex Ask transgender men who have vaginal sex about pain or lack of pleasure Recommend lubricants for anal or vaginal dryness and consider other sources of pain (eg, STIs, fibroids) STI, sexually transmitted infectionSTI, sexually transmitted infectionContinued from page 1519Back to page 13 City Health Informationtesting ( Box 13 ). Discuss the benefits of frequent testing and early diagnosis, counseling patients that treatment can quickly suppress HIV to an undetectable level and prevent transmission to others ( Box 14 ).43,46 New York State (NYS) law requires the offer of HIV testing to adult and adolescent patients in primary and emergency medical care.47 Routinely offer testing for HIV and other STIs using an opt- out approach (eg, \"I test all my patients for HIV and other sexually transmitted infections. Do you have any concerns about getting tested?\") Docu - ment the patient's agreement or refusal in their medical record. Following CDC recommendations , encourage sexually active MSM to test at least annually for HIV.39 MSM may benefit by testing every 3 to 6 months, depending on their sexual practices.39 Order an HIV-1 RNA assay in combination with standard HIV tests for patients who report an HIV exposure or symptoms consistent with acute infection (eg, flu-like symptoms, lymphadenop - athy, skin rash) in the past 4 weeks.48 Counsel all patients that people with recently acquired HIV have high viral loads and can easily pass HIV to others.48 Inform patients that no test can detect HIV immediately following exposure and that they should immediately seek emergency PEP if they were exposed to HIV in the past 72 hours.42,49 HIV treatment Initiate antiretroviral therapy (ART) on the day of initial diagnosis or first HIV-related clin - ic visit, regardless of the patient's CD4 count or viral load.46,50 Immediate treatment can promptly suppress a patient's viral load, which decreases inflammation and immune activation and pre - vents HIV transmission to others ( Box 14 ).43,46,51 Immediate treatment also improves engagement in care: patients who initiate ART on the day of diagnosis are more likely to be retained in care and virally suppressed after 12 months.52 The NYC Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DOHMH) provides guidance on immediate HIV treatment (Resources ).46 For most patients with HIV, care and treat - ment are straightforward.53 If you are a patient's trusted provider but lack expertise in treating HIV, you can discuss if they prefer to transfer to, or be comanaged by, an HIV specialist.54 The NYS Clinical Education Initiative provides expert consultation on managing HIV at 866-637-2342 (Resources ).Intramuscular injections of long-acting medica - tions every 2 months are an alternative to daily oral HIV treatment for adults who are virolog - ically suppressed and have no history of treat - ment failure.55 Clinical trials found that monthly injections of long-acting cabotegravir (CAB-LA) and rilpivirine (RPV-LA) were noninferior to oral regimens in maintaining HIV suppression,56 and that bimonthly injections were just as effective as monthly injections.57 In these trials, 94% to 98% of recipients preferred injections to oral regi -Volume 42 (2023) BOX 12.

OPTIONS FOR HIV TESTING41,42 Different rapid tests provide results in 60 seconds to 30 minutes Fingerstick tests are less invasive than tests that re - quire a blood draw Oral swab tests do not require giving blood Home self-test kits allow testing in private Anonymous testing is available at NYC Sexual Health Clinics BOX 14. WHAT TO TELL YOUR PATIENTS ABOUT UNDETECTABLE HIV43 Knowing about undetectable HIV can reduce HIV-related stigma and facilitate HIV testing and treatment. Inform all patients, even those who do not have HIV, that HIV treatment can reduce the amount of HIV in your body to an undetectable level, which limits the damage that HIV can cause to your body and immune system People who maintain an undetectable viral load cannot pass HIV to others through sex (see Undetectable = Untransmittable for more information) Regular HIV testing allows you to start treatment and get to an undetectable level as soon as possible Medications to treat HIV are safe, effective, and avail - able to all New Yorkers, regardless of their ability to pay or immigration status20Back to page 13 City Health Informationmens.56,57 See US and NYS guidelines on the use of long-acting medications, including guidance on helping patients avoid missing doses and devel - oping treatment-resistant HIV.51,58 For transgender men with childbearing poten - tial, screen for pregnancy before initiating ART; for patients taking testosterone, monitor the effects of HIV treatment on hormone therapy. In choosing an ART regimen for transgender men, as for cisgender men, consider coexisting health conditions such as hyperlipidemia, cardiovascu - lar disease, and osteopenia.59 Poverty, racism, and other social or psychologi - cal factors may undermine a patient's continuity in HIV care or adherence to treatment. Routinely screen for mental health and substance use (see Support Mental Health , page 22). Assess for housing stability, refer patients to housing pro - grams for people with HIV , and follow up with patients to ensure their housing needs are met (Resources for Patients ). Patients can receive HIV treatment and sup - portive services regardless of their ability to pay or immigration status through the NYS Uninsured Care Programs (Resources for Patients ).60,61 PrEP to prevent HIV HIV PrEP is approved for adults and adoles - cents as a daily oral pill or as long-acting injec - tions. When taken consistently, daily oral PrEP is approximately 99% effective in oral PrEP; it is available as a low-cost generic drug and is approved for use by both cisgender and transgender men.63,64 Long-acting CAB-LA as PrEP is administered every 2 months via intramuscular injection, which clinical trials found superior to daily oral TDF/FTC in prevent - ing HIV among cisgender men and transgender women who have sex with men and among cis - gender women.65,66 CDC PrEP guidelines recommend discussing oral and injectable options with all sexually ac - tive patients.64 Patients may prefer taking a daily pill to injections and more frequent clinic visits. Long-acting PrEP can benefit people who do not want to take a daily pill, have difficulty consis - tently taking medications, or have kidney disease that prevents use of oral PrEP.63 Difficulty finding an informed and willing pro - vider is a major barrier to receiving a PrEP pre -Volume 42 (2023) scription.67,68 Offer PrEP to patients at substantial risk of acquiring HIV, including those who have a partner with HIV whose virus may not be consis - tently undetectable, have a rectal bacterial STI or primary or secondary syphilis,64,69-71 or who seek out or take emergency PEP.64 Prescribe PrEP to patients who request it, even if they do not report practices that may put them at risk of acquiring HIV, as not all patients will readily discuss details of their sex lives or drug use.64 New York State PrEP guidelines urge providers not to withhold PrEP from people who use drugs or alcohol, have a mental health disorder, or do not use condoms consistently.72 At PrEP initiation, following CDC guidelines , rule out existing HIV infection with an HIV anti - gen/antibody test and by ordering an HIV-1 RNA assay for patients who report symptoms of acute infection and possible HIV exposure in the last 4 weeks.64 People who take PrEP consistently rarely ac - quire HIV. However, use of antiretroviral med - ications before or during HIV acquisition can suppress viral replication and slow antibody development, which can delay detection of HIV antibodies in acutely infected patients. The CDC currently recommends screening patients on PrEP with an HIV antigen/antibody assay and an HIV-1 RNA assay every 3 months for people taking oral PrEP and at every bimonthly injection for people on long-acting PrEP.64 Counsel patients that PrEP does not prevent other STIs.73 Screen MSM for bacterial STIs ev - ery 3 months for men taking oral PrEP or every 4 months for men receiving injectable PrEP.64 Screen for pregnancy in transgender men who have receptive vaginal-penile sex.74 At follow-up visits, ask patients about any side effects or other challenges to continued PrEP use. Strongly encourage patients who may discon - tinue PrEP to work with you to identify anoth - er method for preventing HIV. In patients who discontinue injectable PrEP, declining drug levels may allow HIV acquisition, and low but per - sistent drug levels may be insufficient to suppress viral replication and can lead to development of antiretroviral resistance.64 PrEP use in NYC is lower among Black and Lati - no people than it is among White people.13 Accel - erating declines in HIV incidence and increasing equity necessitate expanding PrEP access for Black and Latino MSM. From 2017 to 2021 in NYC, 21Back to page 13 City Health Informationnew HIV diagnoses declined 57% among White MSM but only 37% among Latino MSM and 31% among Black MSM.17 Ensure that your clinic pro - motes and does not discourage PrEP use among Black and Latino men, and offers patients clinical and social support to remain on PrEP ( Box 4 ). Medicaid and most health insurance plans cover PrEP without copays for medications, lab work, or clinic visits. Assistance programs can help people with no insurance or high copays pay for PrEP ( Resources for Patients ). Taking PrEP on demand Daily use is the only FDA-approved dosing schedule for oral PrEP. However, taking TDF/ FTC as PrEP \"on demand\"\u2014only before and after sex\u2014is also highly effective for preventing HIV in cisgender men during anal sex.64,75 If a patient has sex once, they take: 2 pills 2 to 24 hours before sex 1 pill 24 hours after the first dose 1 pill 48 hours after the first dose If they continue to have sex, they keep taking 1 pill every 24 hours until they have taken 2 pills after they last had sex. PrEP on demand may appeal to men who can anticipate when they may have sex and who have sex infrequently. Because of a lack of clinical re - search, PrEP on demand is not recommended for transgender men and cisgender women. The NYC DOHMH provides guidance on taking PrEP on de - mand for providers and the public (Resources ).76 Emergency PEP Postexposure prophylaxis (PEP) is the emergen - cy use of antiretroviral medications to prevent a new HIV infection. Emergency PEP is indicated immediately after a possible exposure to HIV\u2014 such as through receptive or insertive anal sex with a partner who may have undiagnosed or unsuppressed HIV. Patients must initiate PEP no more than 72 hours after exposure and complete the 28-day oral regimen. Ensure that patients are aware of HIV PEP so they can seek emergency prophylaxis without delay. Patients in NYC can initiate PEP imme - diately by calling the 24/7 NYC PEP hotline at 844-3-PEPNYC (844-373-7692), visiting a PEP Cen - ter of Excellence , or going to a clinic or emergen - cy room. Assistance programs may help pay for PEP ( Resources for Patients ). NYS guidelines recommend screening for estab -lished HIV infection using lab-based antigen/an - tibody testing. Initiate PEP immediately without waiting for test results, ideally within 2 hours of exposure and no later than 72 hours after an exposure.49 If the HIV test is reactive, contin - ue the patient on the antiretroviral regimen as treatment and consult with an HIV specialist if needed. Recommend that patients who seek out or take emergency PEP consider taking PrEP for contin - ued protection against HIV. Other sexually transmitted infections Encourage MSM to get tested for bacterial STIs at least once a year to ensure prompt treatment and reduce transmission. MSM may benefit from testing every 3 to 6 months, depending on their risk and condom use.77 Screen routinely as some STIs may not present symptoms, particularly at rectal and pharyngeal sites.78 Examine mucosal surfaces and skin (including palms and soles) for signs of syphilis, human pap - illomavirus (HPV), and other STIs. Ask about recent urethral or vaginal discharge, dysuria, lymphadenopathy, skin rash, and genital or perianal lesions; anorectal symptoms consistent with proctitis such as discharge, rectal bleeding, or pain on defecation or during anal sex. Follow CDC guidelines for screening and treat - ment .77,78 Gonorrhea and chlamydia Gonorrhea and chlamydia are often asymp tomatic, particularly in the throat or anus. Screen MSM at each potentially exposed anatomical site regardless of reported sexual activity, although the CDC does not recommend pharyngeal screen - ing for chlamydia. MSM may be more comfort - able swabbing themselves for rectal and pharyn - geal testing.79,80 Hepatitis C Hepatitis C typically spreads through blood-to- blood contact and can be sexually transmitted. Screen for hepatitis C using an antibody test with reflex to RNA PCR, once for anyone who has HIV or has ever injected drugs,80 and annually for anyone who has recently injected drugs and for MSM who have HIV or have sex with men taking PrEP and who do not routinely use condoms.81 Treat patients with confirmed infection following Volume 42 (2023)22Back to page 13 City Health Informationguidelines ,81 or refer them to a treatment pro - gram . Human papillomavirus HPV can result in anal cancer, which is more common among MSM, particularly MSM with HIV.82 Following NYS Guidelines , screen MSM aged 35 years and older living with HIV for anal dysplasia and cancer.83 Screen transgender men with a cervix for cervical cancer.78 Allowing patients to self-swab can increase acceptance of screening for anal and cervical cancers.79,84,85 PROVIDE VACCINATIONS Vaccines prevent illnesses that have higher prevalence among MSM. The CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices86 recom - mends vaccinating all MSM against Hepatitis A : Outbreaks have occurred among MSM in NYC.87 Hepatitis B : This virus can be transmitted through sex.88 HPV : Vaccination protects against anal, oropharyngeal, penile, cervical, vulvar, and vaginal cancers and are available to adults through age 45 years.89,90 Meningococcal disease : MSM are at in - creased risk and should receive the meningo - coccal quadrivalent conjugate vaccine (Men - ACWY), following current guidelines.91 Mpox : A recent global outbreak of mpox has been concentrated among MSM, with the most severe outcomes occurring in men with uncontrolled HIV.92 Offer mpox vaccination to MSM to prevent infection or reduce the se - verity of illness.93 Ensure all patients receive timely HIV testing and treatment.92 Check patients' vaccination status in the City- wide Immunization Registry , and request their consent to add new vaccinations to the Registry. ADDRESS ENTERIC INFECTIONS Anilingus (sometimes called \"rimming\" or \"eating ass\") is a common sexual practice among MSM. Along with fingering, fisting, and the use of anal toys, rimming can result in contact with stool and transmission of hepatitis A, herpes simplex virus, and - ellosis.78,94,95 Enteric infections may persist among immunocompromised people with HIV. To address oral-fecal exposure vaccinate MSM against hepatitis A, test men with diarrhea, cramping, flatulence, or fever for bacterial and parasitic patho - gens, and treat appropriately Shigellosis is often self-limited. Reserve treatment for severely ill or immunocom - promised patients due to increased antibi - otic resistance.78,96,97 recommend that men avoid sex with part - ners who have\u2014or recently had\u2014diarrhea, counsel men to wash their hands, penis and genital area, anus, and sex toys before and after sex. SUPPORT MENTAL HEALTH MSM experience high prevalence of depres - sion, anxiety, and substance use.94 Minority stress theory proposes that individuals in minority groups, including MSM, experience stigma and excess stress that can undermine their physical and mental health.98 Be alert to signs and symptoms of depression, anxiety, posttraumatic stress disorder,99-101 and risk of suicide,102,103 including more than 5 medical or emergency depart - ment visits per year, multiple unexplained symptoms, complaints about memory or cognition, reports of agitation, insomnia or hypersom - nia, feelings of worthlessness or excessive guilt, or diminished interest or pleasure in activities during most of the day, exposure to a traumatic event, or recurring unwanted memories, flashbacks, severe emo - tional distress, or physical reactions related to a traumatic event, often talking or writing about death, dying, suicide, or of having no reason for living; or withdrawing from friends or feeling like a burden to others. Be alert to signs of social isolation; men who have broad sexual networks may struggle to con - nect with others in nonsexual contexts.

TAKE A HARM-REDUCTION APPROACH TO SUBSTANCE USE Men who identify as gay are more likely than those who identify as heterosexual to use alcohol and drugs.111 Substance use can be a way to cope with societal or familial rejection.112 MSM may use alcohol or drugs episodically to enhance or facilitate sex,112,113 including stimulants such as crystal methamphetamine (crystal meth; ie, meth, Tina, or ice), and drugs such as ketamine (ie, Spe - cial K or K), gamma hydroxybutyrate (GHB; ie, G), or amyl nitrite (ie, poppers).112-115 Explain that you ask all your patients about alcohol, tobacco, and other drugs to help them get better care.116 Use initial one- or two-question screens to identify potentially unhealthy sub - stance use ( Box 15 ).Volume 42 (2023)24Back to page 13 City Health InformationHarm reduction emphasizes quality of life and well-being rather than complete abstinence from alcohol or drug use.117 Individual men may bene - fit from a range of harm-reduction messages such as staying hydrated while using drugs or alcohol and avoiding injection equipment that has been used by other people. Harm-reduction strategies include taking PrEP or HIV treatment as pre - scribed while using drugs or alcohol. Crystal methamphetamine Crystal meth is a powerful stimulant that floods the brain's dopamine receptors, producing a sensation of euphoria. Crystal meth use appears to be on the rise among cisgender MSM in NYC, particularly among Black and Latino men.118 For many men, using crystal meth can increase sexual desire and disinhibition while provok - ing erectile dysfunction and hindering condom use.119 Crystal meth's appeal\u2014both in and beyond sexual contexts\u2014can make it difficult to quit.119 To address crystal meth use provide nonjudgmental care to facilitate dis - closure and discussion of use, encourage regular HIV and STI testing and the use of PrEP or HIV treatment, discuss factors that may encourage crystal meth use, including mental health issues or financial insecurity that can lead to having sex for money or housing, counsel patients to limit the drug's harms by using less often or in smaller amounts, assist those interested in reducing or ending their crystal meth use in getting services that can help ( Resources ). Opioids, including fentanyl Buprenorphine and methadone are the most effective treatments for opioid use disorders. For detailed guidance, see Addressing Alcohol and Drug Use\u2014An Integral Part of Primary Care and Buprenorphine\u2014An Office-Based Treatment for Opioid Use Disorder . Counsel patients who use drugs about recent increases in fatal overdose in NYC involving fentanyl, an opioid drug that has been found in heroin, cocaine, ketamine, crystal meth, and deaths NYC involved fentanyl.120 To reduce their risk of overdose, people who use drugs can carry naloxone to reverse an opioid overdose and show others how to use it (more than one dose may be needed) ( Resources for Patients ), test drugs with fentanyl test strips, use a small amount of the drug initially, use with other people Take turns using so one person can admin - ister naloxone or call 911, if necessary, have someone check on them, and avoid the use of different drugs, including alcohol, at the same time. PROVIDE TRAUMA-INFORMED CARE MSM may experience trauma related to their sexuality or gender expression, including sexual abuse, family rejection, fear of HIV and AIDS, and actual or anticipated antigay violence or discrim - ination.94 Poverty, racism, and migration can also cause trauma.98,121 Primary care providers play a key role in recog - nizing trauma. Trauma-informed care emphasiz - es collaboration and empowerment; sensitivity to how a person's lived experience may affect their health and well-being; and flexibility in respond - ing to each patient's unique needs ( Box 16122,123). BOX 16. PROVIDING TRAUMA-INFORMED CARE122,123 Offer a welcoming and safe clinical environment Explain clinical procedures and ask for consent before examining patients Recognize that depression, anxiety, sexual practices, eating disorders, and alcohol or drug use may be a response to, or a way to cope with, past or ongoing trauma Understand that some patients who have experienced trauma may have difficulty engaging in health care if they anticipate having a negative experience Screen for trauma by saying: \"People can have bad experiences that stay with them\u2014 like the death of a friend or family member, a serious accident, a natural disaster, sexual abuse, or physical assault. Have you been affected by anything like that?\" Avoid retraumatizing patients (eg, limit screening frequency to reduce how often a patient must revisit traumatic experiences) Treat patients with empathy and collaborate with them around their care and recovery Refer patients to mental health, substance use, and social service providers or support groups familiar with the needs of MSM ( Resources for Patients ) Consider your own well-being when addressing trau - ma with patientsVolume 42 (2023)25Back to page 13 City Health InformationADDRESS INTIMATE PARTNER VIOLENCE Intimate partner violence (IPV) includes physi - cal, sexual, psychological, or financial abuse used to establish and maintain control.124 Give patients the opportunity to disclose partner violence or abuse in private and consider screening for part - ner violence . If a patient discloses abuse: validate their experiences, conduct a safety assessment and a physical and mental health examination, promptly refer them to appropriate services (Resources for Patients ), document findings thoroughly.
