Immigrant visas to the United States are processed for citizens and residents of Bangladesh at the U.S. Embassy in Dhaka. To apply for an immigrant visa, a foreign citizen seeking to immigrate generally must be sponsored by a U.S. citizen or lawful permanent resident immediate relative(s), or prospective U.S. employer, and have an approved petition before applying for an immigrant visa. The sponsor begins the process by filing a petition on the foreign citizen's behalf with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS). You may wish to review our [Directory of Visa Categories](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/us-visas.html) on usvisas.state.gov to learn about the different types of immigrant visas to the United States.

Nonimmigrant visa applicants may only pay their fees at a branch of Eastern Bank Limited (EBL) after completing their DS-160 online.
