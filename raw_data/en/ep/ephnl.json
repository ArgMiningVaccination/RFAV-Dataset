The Competence Center for Drug Discovery at the ZHAW works on a national and international level with partners from industry and academia to develop new clinical drug candidates. Our mission is to address therapeutic issues in an interdisciplinary environment and to promote the synergy of biological, chemical and medical expertise. Our core competence in medicinal chemistry enables us to work with our partners on a range of indications (e.g. cancer, infectious diseases, metabolic diseases) for the benefit of patients. Translational drug discovery In June 2022, the first symposium \"Competencies in Drug Discovery\" took place at the ZHAW W\u00e4denswil. During the symposium, projects from various therapeutic indications were discussed in an interdisciplinary environment to promote the synergy of biological, chemical and medical competencies. Sponsors Competencies We cover the entire chemistry driven value chain of small molecule and peptide drug discovery: - Medicinal Chemistry - Organic Chemistry - Computer aided drug design - Natural Products - Parallel and automated organic synthesis - Microwave assisted organic synthesis - NMR binding studies of small molecules - Cheminformatics - Recombinant protein production in different expression systems - Protein characterization - Microbial and cellular test methods - Culture Collection of Switzerland ( [www.ccos.ch]) Projects - Therapy for the NRAS melanoma subtype Melanoma is the fifth most common cancer in Switzerland and the most lethal skin cancer. NRAS (neuroblastoma ras viral oncogene homolog)-mutated melanoma is the most aggressive subtype, with no effective therapy after immunotherapy failure. The goal of this project is to develop the first effective targeted therapy ... - Platform for drug target identification A major problem in medicinal chemistry and drug discovery projects is the unknown identity of the molecular biological target, even when very potent ligands are available, such as those discovered in a phenotypic screen. Therefore, methods for hit optimization, such as structure-based design, or better understanding ... - Inhibitors targeting SARS-CoV-2 proteases So far, vaccines are available to combat the Covid-19 pandemic, which can protect against a severe course, although part of society also does not want to be vaccinated or cannot do so due to pre-existing conditions. With a drug that can fight the virus in the organism, infected patients with severe symptoms would be ... - Extracellular vesicles for targeted delivery of new antimicrobials Infectious disease caused by bacteria constitutes a major threat to human health. Although antibiotics control bacterial infections, their efficacy is mitigated by the rise of antibiotic resistance. Further challenging elimination of pathogenic bacteria, some species such as Staphylococcus aureus, responsible for a ...
