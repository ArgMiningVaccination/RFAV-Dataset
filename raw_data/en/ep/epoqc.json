The pharma companies don't know (or not willing to share) the long term effects of vaccines. Similarly no one knows the long term effects of getting and recovering from Covid as well. For an ordinary person (vaccinated vs. unvaccinated) this is a big conundrum. What should they do. Is the long term effects of Vaccines better than contracting COVID or vice versa. We know the effectiveness of vaccines in the first 6-9 months but we don't know what happens in few years. Some people contract COVID and recover in 15 - 30 days (either at home or through hospital visit) but don't know how COVID will affect their body in 5-10 years. People who focus on short term take vaccines. However the population that are looking in to the future are caught in a bind as the new COVID variants show up and pharmas come up with booster shots. Why is this relevant for businesses? In every company there are people who are constantly worried on the long term implications of business managers' decisions. The problem is the \"unknown\". If you don't know for certain what the long term implications are, strategic thinkers ignore them and move ahead. Is that the right strategy or keep worrying about long term and play extremely safe for now. Very debatable point. Coming back to what I started with - Could the long term effects on Vaccines be better than long term effects of contracting COVID, since both are unknown? CDC should address that instead of talking about benefits of Vaccine alone. If uniting the Americans is the goal, even media should address them openly. I have seen agile companies constantly seek out the unknown and model their implications in to the plans. This allows them to respond better for the long term consequences than others who end up with knee jerk reactions when unexpected happens. I can cite examples for both sides but that is not the point. How does your company reconcile the unknown? I have no bones to pick other than encouraging the thinkers. I would definitely appreciate your comments. (I saw an article yesterday about some after affects of COVID which prompted this article) "}
