Summaries Of The News: [ Biden's Budget Proposal Focuses On Health Care ](https://kffhealthnews.org/morning-breakout/bidens-budget-proposal-focuses-on-health-care/) President Biden's budget proposal sent to Congress attempts to lower drug prices, particularly insulin, and increase the number of drugs for which government will negotiate the price. [ Stat: Biden Puts Drug Pricing At The Center Of His Budget ](https://www.statnews.com/2023/03/09/biden-drug-pricing-fda/) President Biden made lowering drug prices a key part of his budget with proposals to expand Medicare drug price negotiation, squeeze more rebates out of drug companies, and lower the cost of insulin for everyone with insurance. (Wilkerson, 3/9) [ The Hill: White House Budget Leans Into Drug Pricing, ObamaCare Expansion ](https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/3892606-white-house-budget-leans-into-drug-pricing-obamacare-expansion/) President Biden's budget proposal focuses heavily on expanding access to health care and lowering the cost of prescription drugs. In an effort to extend the life of Medicare's hospital trust fund, the budget proposal would increase the number of drugs that can be negotiated, and allow those negotiations to begin sooner. (Weixel, 3/9) [ The New York Times: Biden's $6.8 Trillion Budget Proposes New Social Programs And Higher Taxes ](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/09/us/politics/biden-budget.html) President Biden on Thursday proposed a $6.8 trillion budget that sought to increase spending on the military and a wide range of new social programs while also reducing future budget deficits, defying Republican calls to scale back government and reasserting his economic vision before an expected re-election campaign. The budget contains some $5 trillion in proposed tax increases on high earners and corporations over a decade, much of which would offset new spending programs aimed at the middle class and the poor. It seeks to reduce budget deficits by nearly $3 trillion over that time, compared with the country's current path. (Tankersley, 3/9) [ Modern Healthcare: Biden's Budget Proposal Highlights Healthcare Priorities ](https://www.modernhealthcare.com/politics-policy/biden-budget-proposal-healthcare-2024-medicaid-medicare-rural-health) The Biden administration released details Thursday of the president's plans, which touch on Medicare, Medicaid, the Children's Health Insurance Program, the health insurance exchanges, the Indian Health Service, prescription drug prices, mental healthcare, rural health, HIV/AIDS, cancer and other issues. (Turner, 3/9) [ The Hill: Breaking Down Biden's Budget: Here's What's In It ](https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/3891953-breaking-down-bidens-budget-heres-whats-in-it/) Biden also teased a pitch to \"strengthen\" Social Security, which is projected to reach insolvency by 2032, but aside from opposing attempts to \"cut Social Security benefits\" in the request, the administration's proposal appears to fall short of providing a plan to shore up solvency for the program. The plan instead included a 10 percent spending boost for the Social Security Administration, or $1.4 billion, while pushing for investments in \"service delivery to speed up claims processing\" and ensure recipients receive promised benefits. (Folley and Gangitano, 3/9) More on the cost of Medicare \u2014 [ The Wall Street Journal: Biden's Budget Shows The Rising Cost Of Leaving Medicare And Social Security Untouched ](https://www.wsj.com/articles/bidens-budget-shows-the-rising-cost-of-leaving-medicare-and-social-security-untouched-396d8ad2) When President Biden accused some Republicans during his State of the Union address last month of wanting to sunset the country's two big elderly entitlement programs, GOP legislators booed. Mr. Biden responded: \"Social Security and Medicare is off the books now, right? They're not to be touched? All right. We've got unanimity.\" The price of that unanimity becomes starkly clear in Mr. Biden's budget, released Thursday. As promised, it doesn't cut either program's benefits. As a result, their cost continues to ratchet steadily higher. By 2033, they consume 10.5% of gross domestic product, up 2.7 percentage points from last year.

The proposal touts trillions of dollars in spending and policies enacted on Biden's watch, building on passage of the $1.9 trillion coronavirus aid package and bipartisan infrastructure bill, plus Democrats' signature tax, climate and health law. Here are 15 ways the president's fiscal 2024 budget request frames his electoral pitch. (Scholtes and Emma, 3/9) [ Axios: Biden Budget May Be A Preview Of Campaign's Health Platform ](https://www.axios.com/2023/03/10/biden-budget-preview-campaign-health) President Biden's fiscal 2024 health budget contains few bombshells. But it's a useful guide to what he sees as accomplishments to build on \u2014 and likely previews key parts of a prospective 2024 campaign platform. With a divided Congress and little chance of major legislation, Biden's best bet may be drawing contrasts with Republicans on pocketbook issues like drug costs and to portray the GOP as intent on cutting voters' health care and retirement benefits. (Bettelheim, 3/10) More on the cost of insulin and other drugs \u2014 [ Stat: Insulin For $20: Sanders Pushes Bill For Universal Price Caps On Drug ](https://www.statnews.com/pharmalot/2023/03/09/insulin-diabetes-sanders-pbm-rebate/) Now that Eli Lilly is cutting prices on some of its insulin products, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) is seeking to build on that momentum. This week, he introduced a bill that would place a $20 cap on all insulin, a move designed to drastically lower costs for millions of Americans. (Silverman, 3/9) [ Stat: Studies Show R&D Costs, Effectiveness Don't Affect Drug Prices ](https://www.statnews.com/2023/03/10/medicare-drug-pricing-effectiveness/) By law, Medicare will have to take a medication's efficacy and its research and development costs into account when it starts to negotiate drug prices \u2014 but recent research shows pharma companies ignore those factors when they pick prices for their products. (Silberner, 3/10) [ Biden Budget Also Takes On Hep C And Cancer Moonshot ](https://kffhealthnews.org/morning-breakout/biden-budget-also-takes-on-hep-c-and-cancer-moonshot/) Among the proposals submitted to Congress is a request for $20 billion over five years for public health and pandemic preparedness. [ Stat: An $11 Billion White House Plan To End Hepatitis C ](https://www.statnews.com/2023/03/09/white-house-hepatitis-c-11-billion/) The Biden administration is calling on Congress to fund a more than $11 billion program to eliminate hepatitis C in the United States. It's a significant price tag for a single line in the broader budget request; while the $11 billion ask would cover five years of the new initiative, it still dwarfs the annual budget request for the entire Food and Drug Administration, at $7.2 billion. The annual request for the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration also comes in below the hepatitis C topline, at $10.8 billion. (Florko, 3/9) [ Los Angeles Times: Biden Seeks Billions To Stop A Killer: Hepatitis C ](https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2023-03-09/biden-seeks-billions-to-wipe-out-a-hepatitis-c) White House officials said the medicines can now cost roughly $20,000 per patient, but researchers have found curing patients can ultimately save money that would later be spent treating liver ailments. One recent study of the Veterans Affairs system concluded that treating each hepatitis C patient would save more than $62,000 over time, resulting in billions in savings for the system. The Biden administration argued that its plan would reduce Medicaid spending by \"hundreds of millions of dollars\" annually by 2032. (Alpert Reyes, 3/9) On the cancer 'moonshot' \u2014 [ AP: Biden To Seek More Than $2.8B From Congress For Cancer Fight ](https://apnews.com/article/biden-budget-cancer-moonshot-jill-louisiana-fe5064ba6fa19a9c3ea33a2ce8395faf) President Joe Biden is asking Congress for more than $2.8 billion in the federal budget he's sending to Capitol Hill on Thursday to help advance his cancer-fighting goals. More than half of the money, $1.7 billion, would go to the Department of Health and Human Services to support the Democratic president's cancer initiatives across an array of departments and agencies, according to White House officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to share details with The Associated Press before Biden formally unveils his spending blueprint later Thursday in Philadelphia. (Superville, 3/9) [ Stat: Biden Requests Big Cancer Research Spending Bump ](https://www.statnews.com/2023/03/09/biden-cancer-arpa-h/) President Biden is banking on longtime bipartisan interest in eliminating cancer deaths to secure some of his most significant health spending increases for next year. In a long-awaited 2024 budget proposal released Thursday, the president asked for a combined $3.6 billion over the next few years to be channeled to the Cancer Moonshot, a mission to end cancer that he first launched as vice president in 2016, less than a year after his son Beau's death from brain cancer. (Owermohle, 3/9) On pandemic funding \u2014 [ Stat: Biden Requests $20B Cash Infusion To Bolster Public Health ](https://www.statnews.com/2023/03/09/biden-administration-requests-20-billion-cash-infusion-to-bolster-public-health/) The Biden administration is calling for a big boost for public health funding across the federal health department, but left out specific funding for Covid-19 activities. In its budget request to Congress on Thursday, the White House asked for $20 billion over five years to support pandemic preparedness efforts at the Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Institutes of Health, and the Food and Drug Administration. The request aligns with the White House's National Biodefense Plan. (Cohrs, 3/9) On programs for children and families \u2014 [ Reuters: Analysis: Why Biden's Child Programs Likely Won't Go Anywhere ](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/why-bidens-child-programs-likely-wont-go-anywhere-2023-03-09/) U.S. President Joe Biden's budget proposal, released on Thursday, envisions a dramatic expansion of the federal safety net for children and families. Unlike programs that benefit older Americans, it stands little chance of gaining traction. Biden's fellow Democrats widely back his family-focused proposals: Tax credits, free preschool, subsidies for child care and paid family leave. But Democrats failed to pass them into law when they controlled both chambers of Congress last year, and Republicans who now control the House of Representatives are considering steep cuts to existing family programs. (Sullivan, 3/9) [ Newsweek: Biden Wants To Send Americans More Checks ](https://www.newsweek.com/biden-wants-send-americans-checks-1786779) Under Biden's proposed budget, the American Rescue Plan's Child Tax Credit would be restored in full to its 2021 amount. According to a fact sheet provided by the White House, the tax credit cut child poverty in half in 2021, and if approved, would expand the credit to $3,000 per child, an increase of $1,000. Parents with children under the age of 6 would see an even bigger credit, with $3,600 proposed. (Skinner, 3/9) [ FDA Says Breast Density Must Be Discussed At Mammogram Procedure ](https://kffhealthnews.org/morning-breakout/fda-says-breast-density-must-be-discussed-at-mammogram-procedure/) The Food and Drug Administration presented new guidelines on the impact tissue density has on breast cancer: All mammogram centers must tell women if their high breast density puts them at risk. Axios notes the move could protect more people but also drive up test and screening rates. [ AP: US Requires New Info On Breast Density With All Mammograms ](https://apnews.com/article/mammograms-dense-breast-cancer-fda-acbcb47633ff69301e2985537128aa7c) About half of women over age 40 have dense breasts, with less fatty tissue and more connective and glandular tissue. That tissue appears white on X-rays, the same color as growths in the breast, making mammograms harder to read. Dense breast tissue is one of the factors that can increase a woman's chances of developing cancer. Under the new rules, women with dense breasts will receive a written memo alerting them that their status \"makes it harder to find breast cancer.\" Those patients will also be directed to speak with their doctor about their results. (Perrone, 3/9) [ Axios: FDA Mammography Update Raises Cost Questions ](https://www.axios.com/2023/03/10/fda-mammography-guidlines-update) The FDA is updating mammography guidelines in a move that could protect people at higher risk of developing breast cancer but also drive up demand for more tests and screenings. The agency's new rule requires mammogram providers to notify patients about breast density, which can make it harder to detect cancer and as a result, puts some at increased risk of the disease. 38 states already have such reporting requirements. (Gonzalez, 3/10) Americans are postponing medical procedures such as mammograms \u2014 [ NPR: Inflation And Money Woes Are Forcing Americans To Delay Medical Care ](https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2023/03/10/1160702365/high-inflation-and-housing-costs-force-americans-to-delay-needed-health-care) At a health-screening event in Sarasota, Florida, people milled around a parking lot waiting their turn for blood pressure or diabetes checks. The event was held in Sarasota's Newtown neighborhood, a historically Black community. Local resident Tracy Green, 54, joined the line outside a pink and white bus offering free mammograms. \"It's a blessing, because some people, like me, are not fortunate and so this is what I needed,\" she said.

[ CIDRAP: Omicron Less Likely Than Wild-Type Virus To Result In Long COVID, Study Suggests ](https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/covid-19/omicron-less-likely-wild-type-virus-result-long-covid-study-suggests) Swiss researchers find that the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant is much less likely to lead to long COVID than the original, wild-type virus. The research, to be presented at next month's European Congress of Clinical Microbiology & Infectious Diseases (ECCMID) in Copenhagen, Denmark, and not peer-reviewed, found that healthcare workers (HCWs) first infected with Omicron BA.1 were no more likely to have long COVID than their never-infected peers.

The trial enrolled about a thousand participants who were symptomatic with a COVID-19 infection for less than a week. Participants were randomly selected to receive a placebo or one of three drugs: metformin, ivermectin or fluvoxamine.

The emergence of long Covid coincides with an increase in women with disabilities, who have outnumbered their male peers in monthly government labor figures on a regular basis since last June.
