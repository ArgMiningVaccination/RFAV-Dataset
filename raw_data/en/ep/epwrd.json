We hope it answers your questions and helps you cope with any side effects it may cause. We can't advise you about the best treatment for you. This information can only come from your doctor, who knows your full medical history. If you have any further questions about your treatment, ask the doctor, nurse or radiographer looking after you. It's important to talk to someone who is familiar with your treatment, as radiotherapy differs from one person to another. Even if other people you meet have the same cancer as you, they may be having different treatment.

They may also want information to help them support you.5 Understanding radiotherapy Radiotherapy Radiotherapy is the use of high energy x-rays and similar rays (such as electrons) to treat disease. Since x-rays were discovered more than 100 years ago, radiation has been used more and more in medicine, both to help with the diagnosis of illness (by taking pictures with x-rays), and as a treatment for it (radiotherapy). While radiation has to be used very carefully in medicine, specialist doctors and radiographers have a lot of experience in its use. Many people with cancer will have radiotherapy as part of their cancer treatment. It can be given either as: external radiotherapy from outside the body using high energy x-rays (see pages 22-26) internal radiotherapy from a radioactive material placed within the body (see pages 27-34). Radiotherapy works by destroying cancer cells in the area that's treated. Although normal cells can also be damaged by radiotherapy, they can usually repair themselves. Radiotherapy can cure some cancers and can also reduce the chance of a cancer coming back after surgery. It may also be used to control a cancer or to help improve the symptoms of it. The benefits and possible side effects of radiotherapy are discussed in detail in this booklet. Some people find that the side effects are very mild and that they mainly feel tired during their course of radiotherapy. 6Understanding radiotherapy Why radiotherapy is given Curative treatment Radiotherapy is often given with the aim of destroying a tumour and curing the cancer. Radiotherapy given in this way is described as curative or radical radiotherapy. Radiotherapy may be used on its own, or it may be given before or after surgery or chemotherapy. Chemotherapy is the use of anti-cancer drugs to destroy cancer cells. If radiotherapy and chemotherapy are given at the same time, this treatment is known as chemoradiation. For most types of curative radiotherapy treatment, you will need to go to hospital each weekday, Monday -Friday, for 2-7 weeks. Palliative treatment When it's not possible to cure a cancer, radiotherapy may be given to relieve symptoms such as pain. This is called palliative treatment . Lower doses of radiotherapy are given for palliative treatment than for curative treatment, and they're usually given over a shorter period of time. Sometimes just a single treatment may be given.7 Understanding radiotherapy The radiotherapy department Radiotherapy equipment is very complex and needs a lot of space and specially trained staff, so radiotherapy departments tend to be in the larger regional and teaching hospitals. Often you'll have your initial cancer treatment, such as surgery, at your local hospital and will then be referred to your nearest specialist cancer hospital for radiotherapy. Radiotherapy departments have varying types of equipment and are organised according to local needs, so they may be run in different ways. Most of the information in this booklet will apply to most departments, but you may find there are some differences at the hospital where you are being treated. You can usually have external radiotherapy (see page 22) as an outpatient, but if you are unwell or having chemotherapy at the same time, you may need to stay in hospital. In this case you will go to the radiotherapy department each day from the ward. If you're having internal radiotherapy (see page 27), you may have to stay in hospital for a few days.8Understanding radiotherapy Radiotherapy staff Clinical oncologist A clinical oncologist , sometimes called a cancer specialist , is a doctor who is trained in the use of radiotherapy and chemotherapy. They are responsible for prescribing and supervising your course of treatment. You may see your clinical oncologist before, during and after your course of radiotherapy so that the effect of the treatment can be monitored. If you have any problems between these appointments, the nurses or radiographers can arrange an extra one for you. If you're having chemotherapy as well as radiotherapy, your treatment may be supervised by a doctor called a medical oncologist . Medical oncologists specialise in chemotherapy treatment.Medical oncologists and clinical oncologists work as part of a team. This team is called a multidisciplinary team (MDT) and includes all the healthcare staff who look after people having cancer treatment. The MDT will have regular meetings to coordinate and plan your care and treatment. Radiographers Radiographers are trained in using x-ray equipment. There are two main types of radiographer: diagnostic radiographers and therapy radiographers.9Understanding radiotherapy Diagnostic radiographers use x-rays and scans to diagnose illness. You may have x-rays or scans from time to time during and after your treatment to check the effect your radiotherapy is having on you. Therapy radiographers operate the machines that give you your radiotherapy treatment. They are trained in giving radiotherapy and in patient care. They also play an important part in helping you cope with any problems you have during your treatment, and can give information, support and counselling. They work closely with your clinical oncologist, and a physicist (see below) to plan your treatment. Where possible you'll see the same radiographers throughout your course of treatment, so you may get to know them well. They can give you help and advice about any aspect of your treatment, and you can discuss any of your concerns or anxieties with them. You can ask to be treated by a radiographer of the same sex as yourself, if you prefer. Radiotherapy assistants Some radiotherapy departments have radiotherapy assistants . They help the radiographers deliver your treatment and can give you information and support. Physicist The clinical oncologist works with a physicist - a radiation expert - who helps plan your treatment. Together they will decide the best way of giving the prescribed amount of 10Understanding radiotherapy radiation. The physicist is also responsible for making sure the radiotherapy equipment is used accurately. You may not meet the physicist, as they usually work behind the scenes. Mould room technician You may need to have a mould made of part of your body to keep it still during treatment (see pages 19-20). This will usually be done by technical staff in the mould room. Nurses Some radiotherapy clinics have nurses who look after your general needs, such as dressings and medicines. The nurses in the radiotherapy department can also give information and advice about the treatment, as well as practical support. Many cancer centres have specialist cancer nurses, sometimes called clinical nurse specialists , who have expert knowledge about your type of cancer. They can also be a good source of support and information during your treatment. Other members of the cancer support team DietitianA dietitian can give you advice if you have problems eating and drinking because of your radiotherapy treatment - for example, if you have difficulty swallowing or have a dry mouth. Speech and language therapists If the radiotherapy is being given to the neck area, it may temporarily affect your speech. A speech and language therapist will be involved in your recovery and can give you advice and support. 11 Understanding radiotherapy 12Understanding radiotherapy Social worker Social workers can give advice about any non-medical problems you have, including practical and financial help. For example, some people can claim travel expenses and others may be eligible for a grant from a charity. Social workers can also provide or arrange counselling and emotional support for you and your family. If necessary, they can refer you to local support services that can help you at home. You can ask to see a social worker if you think this would be helpful. Symptom control team (Palliative care team) Many hospitals have a symptom control team who give extra help and support to people with symptoms or side effects of treatment that are causing problems. There may be other staff, such as physiotherapists, who can help with any specific questions you may have. Counsellors Counsellors are available in some hospitals. If you feel that speaking to a counsellor would be helpful, ask the staff looking after you to arrange an appointment. 13 Understanding radiotherapy Practical things to consider Getting to your appointment Most hospitals charge for car parking, but many will offer reduced charges or reimburse the cost of parking for people who are having radiotherapy. Ask the radiographers about the arrangements at your hospital when you come for treatment. You may want to drive yourself to hospital for your treatment, but if you have to drive a long way each day, you're likely to feel tired after a while. Tiredness is a common side effect of radiotherapy. You may want to think about asking a relative or friend to drive you to the hospital if you do feel tired. If you rely on public transport or the help of a relative or friend, you can sometimes arrange your appointments at a time that suits you both. However, due to the number of people having radiotherapy, it's not always possible to get an appointment exactly when you want it. Some hospitals provide transport. If you need this, the hospital's transport department will assess your needs and, if possible, make the arrangements for you. Some local support groups and charities also provide hospital transport. If transport is a problem, or if you live a long way from the hospital, you may need to stay in a 'hostel' ward in the hospital or nearby. Sometimes it's possible for the hospital to organise local accommodation while you are having radiotherapy. If you're having difficulty meeting the cost of travelling to the hospital each day, you may be able to get a grant towards 14Understanding radiotherapy your travel expenses. People on a low income may be able to claim the costs from the Department of Work and Pensions or through the Hospital Travel Costs Scheme. Some charities, such as Macmillan Cancer Support, provide travel grants, and so do some local support groups. You can ask the staff in the radiotherapy department or a hospital social worker for information on travel costs, grants and advice on how to claim. See pages 62-64 for more information about financial help and benefits. Giving your consent Before you have radiotherapy, your doctor will explain the aims of treatment to you. They will usually ask you to sign a form saying that you give permission (consent ) for the hospital staff to give you the treatment. No medical treatment can be given without your consent, and before you are asked to sign the form you should have been given full information about: the type and extent of the treatment the advantages and disadvantages any significant risks or side effects any other treatments that may be available. If you don't understand what you've been told, let the staff know straight away so they can explain again. Some cancer treatments are complex, so it's not unusual for people to need repeated explanations. It's often a good idea to have a relative or friend with you when the treatment is explained, as they can help you remember the discussion more fully. 15 Understanding radiotherapy You may also find it useful to write down a list of questions before you go to your appointment. People sometimes feel that the hospital staff are too busy to answer their questions, but it's important for you to be aware of how the treatment is likely to affect you. The staff should be willing to make time for your questions. You can always ask for more time if you feel that you can't make a decision when the treatment is first explained to you. You are also free to choose not to have the treatment. The staff can explain what may happen if you don't have it. It's essential to tell a doctor, or the nurse in charge, so they can record your decision in your medical notes. You don't have to give a reason for not wanting treatment, but it can help to let the staff know your concerns so they can give you the best advice. Possible pregnancy Women of childbearing age will be asked whether they might be pregnant, as radiotherapy given during pregnancy could harm a developing baby. If you think that you may be pregnant, tell the doctors and radiographers immediately and you'll be offered a pregnancy test. Smoking Research has shown that stopping smoking during and after radiotherapy may make the radiotherapy more effective. It can also reduce the side effects of treatment, improve your general health and reduce your risk of developing other cancers. 16Understanding radiotherapy Not smoking or cutting down at such a stressful time can be very difficult. If you want help or advice on how to quit, you can talk to your clinical oncologist, GP or a specialist nurse. Organisations such as QUIT (see page 73) can also offer advice and support. Planning your treatment Before you start your treatment you will normally have an appointment at the clinic to see your clinical oncologist (see page 8). They will discuss the treatment they recommend with you. Before you start your treatment you will need to have it planned. Radiotherapy may be planned and given in a very simple way for certain conditions, such as with many types of skin cancers and for palliative treatment. Your cancer specialist may simply put marks on your skin with a soft pen where the treatment is needed (see page 21). For most curative treatments, more detailed and complicated planning is needed. Planning is a very important part of radiotherapy. It may take a few visits - and can take up to two weeks - to complete before you can start your treatment. Careful planning makes sure that the radiotherapy is as effective as possible. It ensures the rays are aimed precisely at the cancer and cause the least possible damage to the surrounding healthy tissue. The treatment is planned by your clinical oncologist, a physicist and sometimes by a senior radiographer. 17 Understanding radiotherapy First planning visit On your first visit you may have a CT (computerised tomography) scan taken of the area to be treated. A CT scan takes lots of images from different angles to build up a three-dimensional picture of the area. At the same time, therapy radiographers will take measurements from you, which are needed for treatment planning. This session will usually take about 45-60 minutes. Sometimes you may also need to have an MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) scan . This uses powerful magnetic fields to give a detailed picture of part of your body, which can give additional useful information. The radiographer's measurements and the information from the scans are fed into a planning computer that helps your doctors plan your treatment precisely. Some special procedures may be needed to make sure the radiographers get a clear picture. For example, to plan treatment to the pelvic area, a liquid that shows up on x-ray may be passed into your back passage or into your bladder, or a tampon may be used to show the exact position of the vagina. These procedures may be slightly uncomfortable but aren't painful and only take a few minutes. They are only used for planning the treatment and are not repeated during the treatment sessions. The radiographer will explain these procedures to you. It's important for you to feel that you are involved in your treatment, so feel free to ask as many questions as you like.18Understanding radiotherapy 19 Understanding radiotherapy Moulds To help you stay still and in position during the radiotherapy, you may need a device called a mould . This will be made before planning starts, and is used to help keep you still so that the treatment is as effective as possible. Radiotherapy moulds are sometimes called masks or shells. The mould is made of a plastic mesh (see diagram below) or clear perspex (see diagram on next page). A warm plastic mesh is put on to your face so that the plastic gently moulds to fit your face20Understanding radiotherapy Moulds are often used for treatments to the head and neck area. Sometimes a mould of your leg, arm or other body part is used to keep the area still during treatment. Any marks can then be made on the mould instead of your skin. Moulds are commonly used for children having radiotherapy. Your mould should fit snugly. If the mould is uncomfortable in any way, let the radiographer know as they can usually adjust it. Remember you'll only have the mould on for the time it takes to give you your treatment. We can send you a fact sheet about making a radiotherapy mould. A finished perspex mask 21 Understanding radiotherapy Skin markings Once the treatment area has been decided, ink markings are sometimes made on your skin (or on the mould) to pinpoint the exact place where the radiation will be directed. The staff will explain how to look after these markings (see page 39). If the marks begin to rub off, tell your radiographer. Don't try to redraw them yourself. The marks can rub off on to clothing, so some people choose to wear older clothes next to their skin during treatment. Often two or more small tattoo marks are also made on the skin. These marks are permanent, but they are the size of a pinpoint and will only be done with your permission. It's a little uncomfortable while the tattoo is being done, but it's a good way of making sure that treatment is directed accurately. The tattoo marks are also useful once treatment has finished, as they show the area where the radiotherapy was given and prevent further radiotherapy from being given there in the future. This is useful because radiotherapy can usually only be given to an area of the body once before it starts to cause harm rather than doing good.22Understanding radiotherapy External radiotherapy External radiotherapy is normally given as a series of short, daily treatments in the radiotherapy department using equipment similar to a large x-ray machine. Treatment is individually planned, and even people with the same type of cancer may have different types of radiotherapy treatment. The following information is only guide, as the details of treatment will vary from person to person. A course of curative (radical) treatment may last 2-7 weeks. The treatments are usually given once a day, with a rest at the weekend. Each treatment is called a fraction . Giving the treatment in fractions ensures that less damage is done to normal cells than to cancer cells. The damage to normal cells is mainly temporary, but this is what causes the side effects of radiotherapy (see page 36-41). Some people may have more than one treatment daily or treatment every day for two weeks, including the weekends. Sometimes treatment may only be given on three days each week - for example, Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays. Usually, each radiotherapy treatment takes about 10-15 minutes. Most of this time is spent getting you in position and doing checks. The treatment itself usually only lasts a few minutes. Palliative treatment (for symptom control) may involve only one or two sessions of treatment, but it can be up to 10 sessions.23 Understanding radiotherapy There are several different types of radiotherapy machines that work in different ways. Radiotherapy treatment for most cancers, apart from skin cancers, is given by machines called linear accelerators , which are often called LinAcs. The radiotherapy machine doesn't normally touch you, although for some types of cancer it may press against your skin. If you have a specific type of radiotherapy called electron treatment , a small applicator that touches a small area of skin may be used. The treatment itself is painless, although it may gradually cause some uncomfortable side effects (see pages 36 -41). External radiotherapy doesn't make you radioactive. It's perfectly safe for you to be with other people, including children, throughout your treatment. Having external radiotherapy treatment Before your first treatment, the radiographers will explain to you what you will see and hear. It's normal to feel anxious about having your treatment, but as you get to know the staff and understand what's going on, it should become easier. The sight of large radiotherapy machines can be frightening, especially for children. Don't be afraid to talk to the staff about any fears or worries - they are there to help you, and the more you understand your treatment, the more relaxed you will be. The radiographers will position you carefully on the table and adjust its height and position. Because it's so important that you're in the right position, the radiographers may take a little while getting you ready. They may call this 'setting up' . 24Understanding radiotherapy 25 Understanding radiotherapy The room may be in semi-darkness while this is happening. The table you are lying on will be quite hard. Let the radiographer know if it's uncomfortable, as they can often make you feel more comfortable by putting foam pads or pillows underneath you. It's important that you're comfortable because you have to lie as still as possible during the treatment. Once you're in the correct position, the radiographers will need to leave you alone in the room. This is to prevent them from being exposed to any unnecessary radiation. Don't worry if they seem to rush out of the room once they have positioned you - this is just to keep your treatment time as short as possible. Positioning the radiotherapy machine26Understanding radiotherapy Some treatment rooms have CD players so you can listen to music to help you relax while having your treatment. During the treatment you will be alone for a few minutes, but there will be an intercom so you can talk to the radiographers. They will be watching you carefully from the next room, either through a window or on a television screen. To protect your privacy, nobody else will be able to see you. If you have any problems, you can raise your hand to attract the radiographer's attention and they will come in to help you. Most curative (radical) radiotherapy involves having treatment from several different directions. While you're lying still, the machine will move into the new position. Usually the radiographers will be in the treatment room with you when this happens. Once the machine has been repositioned the radiographers will make sure you are still in the right position before the treatment continues. Once your treatment session has finished, the radiotherapy staff will come back into the room and help you get ready to go home or back to the ward.27 Understanding radiotherapy Internal radiotherapy Brachytherapy Brachytherapy is a type of internal radiotherapy. There is another type of internal radiotherapy called radioisotope therapy, which is discussed on page 32. Brachytherapy involves putting a solid radioactive material close to, or inside, the tumour. This gives a high dose of radiotherapy directly to the tumour but only a low dose to normal tissues. Brachytherapy is used mainly to treat cancers in the prostate gland, cervix, womb, or head and neck, but it can be used to treat other cancers. If you have brachytherapy you may have to stay in hospital for a few days, and special safety measures will be taken while the radioactive material is in your body (see page 33). Once the treatment is over, there is no risk of exposing your family or friends to the radiation. Brachytherapy for prostate cancer Brachytherapy using radioactive seed implants is sometimes used to treat small tumours of the prostate gland. It may be given in combination with external radiotherapy. Prostate brachytherapy is only available in some hospitals in the UK, so you may have to travel for this treatment. It's carried out under a general anaesthetic or sometimes a spinal anaesthetic (epidural). Small radioactive metal seeds are placed into the tumour within the prostate gland. They release small doses of radiation very slowly over a period of time. The seeds are not removed, but stay in the prostate gland permanently. 28Understanding radiotherapy Before the seeds are implanted, you'll usually need a planning visit to the hospital. The seeds are implanted during a single session so you can usually go home on the same day, although some men may need to stay in hospital overnight. The radioactivity gradually fades away over about a year. The radiation only affects the area a few millimetres around the seeds, so there is no danger of it affecting other people. Brachytherapy for prostate cancer is described in more detail in our booklet Understanding early (localised) prostate cancer. Brachytherapy for cancer of the cervix or womb In the treatment of cancers of the cervix or lining of the womb (endometrium), brachytherapy (also sometimes called intracavitary therapy ) can be used on its own or combined with external radiotherapy. The treatment is often given before or after surgery. A piece of radioactive material called a source is put close to the cancer or, if you've had surgery, the area where it was before being removed. The source is placed inside hollow plastic or metal tubes called applicators, which are positioned at the top of the vagina. These keep the source in place. Sometimes only one tube is used. The applicators are placed inside the vagina while you're under a general anaesthetic or sedation in the operating room. The applicators are kept in place by a pack (cotton/gauze padding) inside the vagina. This can be uncomfortable but you can have regular painkillers to ease any discomfort. 29 Understanding radiotherapy At the same time, a flexible tube called a catheter may be put into your bladder to drain off urine. This means that during your treatment you won't risk dislodging the applicators if you have to move around to pass urine. Once the applicators are in place, an x-ray will be taken to check they're in the correct position. Sometimes the radioactive source is put into the applicators while you're in the operating room, but more commonly it will be put in place once you're back on the ward in your own room. Internal radiotherapy may be given as low dose rate treatment or high dose rate treatment. Both low dose rate and high dose rate treatment give the same total dose of radiotherapy but do so over different time periods. Once the source is in place, you have to stay in bed so that the applicators don't move out of position. If you need anything, you can call a member of staff by using the buzzer by your bed. Many women find the prospect of this treatment worrying. It's important to talk things through with your cancer specialist so that you understand as much as you need to about what your treatment involves. Some hospitals have specialist nurses who are trained to give advice and support to women having treatment for gynaecological cancer. Ask your cancer specialist about the kind of help available in your hospital. Low dose rate treatment In many hospitals a machine called a Selectron , or a similar name, is used to put the radioactive material into the applicators. The machine is attached by tubes to the applicators. When the machine is switched on, it passes small radioactive balls into the applicators. If the machine is switched off, the radioactive balls are pulled back inside the 30Understanding radiotherapy machine. The machine is kept switched on throughout treatment, except when someone needs to go into your room. It can then be turned off to reduce their exposure to the rays. However, safety measures and visiting restrictions are still necessary. The time you spend on the machine varies, but it's usually between 12-48 hours. High dose rate treatment Sometimes a machine called a Microselectron is used for internal radiotherapy. It gives a higher dose of radiotherapy over a shorter period of time, so the treatments last only a few minutes and you can go home on the same day. Treatments may be repeated several times, a few days apart. After the treatment Once the treatment is completed, the source and the applicators will be removed. This is usually done in your own room on the ward rather than in an operating theatre. As it can be a little uncomfortable, you will be offered some painkillers beforehand. Sometimes a few breaths of the gas Entonox \u00ae will help you relax. Staff on the ward will check that all the applicators and sources have been removed. Your catheter may be removed at the same time. Your cancer specialist may suggest that you use vaginal douches for a few days after the applicator has been removed. Vaginal douches are a way of rinsing the vagina to keep it clean. The nurses will tell you more about this. You will probably be able to go home on the same day or the day after. Once the radioactive sources are removed, all traces of radioactivity disappear immediately. You can read more about these treatments in our booklets Understanding cervical cancer and Understanding womb (endometrial) cancer. 31 Understanding radiotherapy Caesium or iridium wire brachytherapy These can be used to treat a number of different cancers including mouth, lip, cervical and breast cancer. Very thin radioactive needles, wires or tubes are inserted while you are under general anaesthetic in the operating room. An x-ray may be taken to ensure that the needles are in the correct position. You will be in a room on your own, and the safety measures described on page 33 will be used until the wires are removed, which usually happens after 3-8 days. Sometimes the wires are removed under a general anaesthetic. Wires in the mouth can be uncomfortable, and can make eating and talking difficult. You will need to have a soft or liquid diet while they are in place. Your nurse will show you how to keep your mouth clean by using mouthwashes regularly. If eating is a problem, you may be fed through a thin tube (a nasogastric or NG tube), which is passed up your nose and down into your stomach. We can send you a fact sheet about artificial feeding. Once the wires have been removed, the area will feel sore for up to 2 -3 weeks afterwards. Your clinical oncologist will prescribe painkillers for you to take regularly until this improves. After caesium or iridium wire brachytherapy, there is a slight risk of infection, but this is very rare. If you develop a high temperature or heavy bleeding after your treatment, contact your clinical oncologist as soon as possible so they can prescribe antibiotics to treat the infection.32Understanding radiotherapy Radioisotope therapy Radioisotope therapy is given as a drink or capsules that are swallowed or by injection into a vein (intravenous injection). Cancer cells absorb the radioisotope more than normal cells and receive a higher dose of radioactivity. The same safety precautions are taken with this type of treatment as for other types of internal radiotherapy (see next page). Radioactive iodine The most common type of radioisotope treatment is radioactive iodine. It's mainly used to treat tumours of the thyroid gland and is given as capsules or a drink. It's also used to treat some rarer types of cancer, such as neuroblastoma. This treatment involves a stay in hospital. Any radioactive iodine that's not absorbed by the thyroid will be passed out from the body in sweat and urine. You need to drink plenty of fluids during your treatment as this helps to flush the iodine out of the body. The amount of radiation in your body will be checked regularly, and as soon as it falls to a safe level, which happens after about 4 -7 days, you will be able to go home. You may need to take some special precautions after going home - for example, you may need to avoid young children and pregnant women for a short time. The hospital staff will explain these precautions to you. Radioactive iodine doesn't usually cause side effects, but you may feel very tired for a few weeks after having this treatment.33 Understanding radiotherapy Treating secondary bone cancer Radioisotope treatment can also be given for certain types of cancer that have spread to the bones (secondary bone cancer). A radioisotope called radioactive strontium is injected into a vein. You can have it as an outpatient. Before you go home you'll be given some simple advice to follow, as your urine and blood will be slightly radioactive for a few days. You may feel tired for a few weeks, but this type of radiotherapy treatment doesn't usually cause any other side effects. You can read more about these treatments in our booklets Understanding thyroid cancer and Understanding secondary cancer in the bone. Safety measures for internal radiotherapy Safety measures need be taken to prevent unnecessary radiation exposure to the hospital staff, your relatives and friends. Depending on the type of treatment you're having, restrictions may be needed for a few days - but sometimes it's only for a few minutes. The staff looking after you will explain the restrictions in more detail before you start your treatment. Each hospital has different routines, so it's worth visiting the treatment area beforehand to discuss with the nursing and medical staff what will happen. You may be admitted to the ward the day before your treatment so the staff can go over the procedure with you. This is a good time to ask questions, and it may help to make a list beforehand so you don't forget something important (you may find it helpful to write down your questions on page 80 of this booklet).34Understanding radiotherapy The safety measures and visiting restrictions might make you feel isolated, frightened and depressed at a time when you may want people around you. If you have any of these feelings, it's important to tell the staff looking after you. You may find it helpful to take in plenty of reading material and other items to keep you occupied while you're in the single room. There will also usually be a television and a radio in the room. Brachytherapy If you're having brachytherapy, you only need to stay in isolation while the radioactive source is in place. Once it has been removed, the radioactivity disappears and it's perfectly safe to be with other people. This doesn't apply to brachytherapy for prostate cancer, as the radioactive seeds are not removed. With prostate brachytherapy the radiation affects only the area a few millimetres around the seeds, so there's no danger of it affecting other people. Radioisotope therapy If you're having treatment with a radioisotope the radioactivity will disappear gradually, so you will need to stay in isolation until the radiation in your body has dropped to a safe level. Before you leave hospital, the staff will check that most of the radioactivity in your body has gone and that your belongings are free from any signs of radioactivity. After you leave hospital you should be able to carry on with your life normally, but there may be a few restrictions about contact with people - especially children and pregnant women - for a few more days.35 Understanding radiotherapy 36Understanding radiotherapy Side effects of radiotherapy Radiotherapy affects people in different ways, so it's difficult to predict exactly how you'll react to your treatment. Before you start, the staff will discuss the side effects of the particular treatment you're having with you. They can also give tips on how to deal with them and how they can be treated. You may find it helpful to read our booklet about your type of cancer, which will include information about the possible side effects of radiotherapy. Being aware of side effects in advance can help you cope with any that may develop. In this section, we discuss the general side effects of radiotherapy that you may experience, whichever part of the body you're having radiotherapy to. External radiotherapy tends to cause more general side effects than internal therapy. It's important to remember that most people will have only a few of the side effects mentioned here, and for many people they will be mild. There have been huge improvements in radiotherapy treatment, and severe side effects are very rare. Most side effects of radiotherapy will continue for about 10-15 days after treatment has finished and then gradually begin to get better. For some people however, they may continue for a few weeks. Tiredness You may feel very tired during your radiotherapy treatment. Tiredness (fatigue) can often be made worse by having to travel 37 Understanding radiotherapy to hospital each day, or by other treatment such as surgery or chemotherapy. Listen to your body and, if necessary, allow yourself extra time to rest, perhaps by taking a nap. It may help if you spread chores out over the week, sit down to do them wherever possible and accept any offers of help. Tiredness can be a problem for several months after your treatment has finished. We can send you a booklet about coping with fatigue. Feeling sick Some people find that their treatment makes them feel sick (nauseous), and sometimes they may actually be sick (vomit ). This is most common when the treatment area is near the stomach. Your clinical oncologist can prescribe very effective anti-sickness (anti-emetic) drugs if this happens, and they may prescribe them anyway as a precaution. Tell your clinical oncologist if you have any nausea or vomiting, and remember that it usually stops once treatment is over. We have a fact sheet about coping with nausea and vomiting. Eating and drinking As always during treatment of any kind, it's important to have a healthy diet and drink plenty of fluids. At times you may not feel like eating or you might find that your eating habits change. It can be easier to have small snacks throughout the day rather than large meals. You may lose a bit of weight during radiotherapy, especially if you have radiotherapy to the head or neck area. It's important to try and maintain your 38Understanding radiotherapy weight throughout treatment, as the radiotherapy will have been planned on your body's shape. Tell the radiotherapy staff if you're having any problems with eating, as they can arrange for you to talk to the hospital dietitian. You may find our booklet Diet and cancer helpful. Skin care Some people develop a skin reaction while having external radiotherapy. If this happens, it may begin after about 10 days. How your skin reacts will vary depending on the amount of radiotherapy you have. People with pale skin may find that the skin in the treatment area becomes red and sore or itchy. People with darker skin may also find their skin feels itchy and becomes darker with a blue or black tinge. Sometimes the skin will get very sore and it may break and leak fluid, although this doesn't happen very often. If your skin gets very sore, your treatment may have to be delayed for a short time to allow the area to recover, although this is rare. The extent of the reaction depends on the area being treated and the individual's skin. Some people have no skin problems at all. Your radiographers will be looking for these reactions, but you should also let them know as soon as you notice any soreness or change in skin colour. Staff in the radiotherapy department will be able to give you advice on how to look after your skin in the treated area. This will vary according to the part of the body that's being treated and the dose of radiotherapy. 39 Understanding radiotherapy You may be advised to use only tepid water and unperfumed soaps to wash the area, and not to soak too long in the bath. You can dry your skin by patting it gently with a soft towel or using a hairdryer blowing cold air, but you shouldn't rub the area, as this may make it sore. Perfumed soaps, talcum powder, deodorants and perfumes may also make your skin sore and shouldn't be used at all. The staff at the hospital may suggest that you gently apply plain moisturisers, such as E45 cream or aqueous cream, to the area. After your treatment, plain soap and plain moisturisers are often recommended. Aloe vera cream can sometimes help the skin to heal. It's important not to use any creams or dressings unless they have been prescribed or recommended by your clinical oncologist or radiographer. It's very important that any marks put on your skin to show the treatment area are not removed until the treatment has finished. If the marks do fade or disappear, don't try to replace them yourself - tell the radiotherapy staff straight away. Men who are having radiotherapy to the head and neck may be advised not to shave the area or to use an electric razor rather than wetshaving. These restrictions apply only to the treatment area - the rest of your skin can be treated normally. Your skin may peel after the redness has faded, but it will gradually heal. Changes to the skin usually settle down 2-4 weeks after treatment has finished, but the area may stay slightly darker than the surrounding skin.40Understanding radiotherapy Avoiding the sun The skin in the treated area is very sensitive and needs protecting from the sun or cold winds. If you're having radiotherapy to your head or neck, try wearing a hat or a silk or cotton scarf when you go outside. For at least the first year after your radiotherapy, it's very important to cover the treated area if you go out in strong sunshine. Wear clothes made of cotton or natural fibres, which have a closer weave and offer good protection against the sun. Even after this time, the area of treated skin will be more delicate than normal, so take extra care. Use a suncream with a high sun protection factor (SPF) of at least 30 and cover the area with a hat or close-weave clothing. It's important to remember that you can burn through clothing if you are out in hot sun for a long time. You can swim as soon as any skin reaction has settled down, usually within a month of finishing treatment. If you are swimming outdoors however, don't stay in the water too long and remember to use a waterproof suncream. Clothing Loose-fitting clothes, preferably made of natural fibres rather than man-made materials, are more comfortable and less irritating to the skin. Avoid tight collars and ties if you're having radiotherapy to your neck. Shoulder straps and bra straps can cause irritation if they rub against treated skin. If your breast area is being treated, you may be more comfortable not wearing a bra or wearing a vest instead.41 Understanding radiotherapy Hair loss Having radiotherapy causes hair loss within the treatment area. Hair loss can also happen where the radiation beam leaves the body (for example, on the back of the neck), as well as where it enters the body. Ask your clinical oncologist or radiographer to show you exactly where your hair will fall out. Hair usually begins to fall out after 2-3 weeks. Hair should grow back after treatment finishes. This may take several months, although it depends on the dose of radiotherapy you have. Your radiographer can tell you if any hair loss is likely to be permanent. We can send you a booklet about hair loss, which gives tips on covering it up and coping with the emotional effects. Changes in your blood Radiotherapy to some parts of the body may affect the bone marrow. This is the spongy material inside some of our bones and is where the different types of blood cells are made. If the doctors think this might happen to you, you will have regular blood tests during your treatment to check the number of cells in your blood (your blood count). If your blood count is low, you may feel tired and run down. If your blood count becomes very low (which is unlikely), you may need to have a short rest from treatment so that your blood cell levels can return to normal. You may also need to have a blood transfusion. It's very important to let your doctors know if you feel very unwell, if your temperature goes above 38\u00b0C (100.4\u00b0F), or if you start feeling cold and shaky.42Understanding radiotherapy Effects of radiotherapy on sexuality Radiotherapy can sometimes cause physical changes that may affect your sex life. If you're having problems, it may help to talk these over with your partner and your medical team. Although it can be embarrassing to talk to health professionals about intimate concerns, remember that they are used to dealing with these issues and can suggest things that will help. You can also get advice and support from the College of Sexual and Relationship Therapists (see page 71). You may also wish to call us and speak in confidence to one of our cancer support specialists on freephone 0808 808 00 00 . We have a booklet called Sexuality and cancer , which describes practical ways of dealing with changes to sexuality. Effects on women External and internal radiotherapy to the pelvis usually affects the ovaries. Radiotherapy to the ovaries will bring on the menopause. This may happen gradually over a few months. The normal signs of the menopause will develop, such as hot flushes, dry skin and dryness in the vagina. This can be very distressing, particularly for younger women who are not prepared for the menopause. Depending on the type of cancer you have, your doctor may prescribe hormone replacement therapy (HRT), which can help 43 Understanding radiotherapy overcome these problems. Occasionally - for example, when treating types of cancers called lymphomas - the ovaries may be moved out of the treatment area and into the upper part of the abdomen. This is done by an operation before the radiotherapy treatment. Your clinical oncologist can tell you more about this. Radiotherapy to the vaginal area can occasionally make the vagina narrower. The radiotherapy staff will show you how to use vaginal dilators and a lubricant to keep your vagina supple once you have finished treatment. At first you may find sex uncomfortable, and it may help to use a lubricant, which you can buy at your local chemist. Having sex regularly may help prevent narrowing of the vagina, but many women will not want to have sex while they have the side effects of radiotherapy. This is very natural, and your interest in sex usually comes back as the effects of treatment wear off. In the meantime, using a dilator is an effective way of keeping your vagina healthy. Effects on men Men who have radiotherapy may have problems with sex. You may lose interest in it or become temporarily unable to get an erection (impotent) because of your anxiety about your illness or worries about the future, or even because the treatment is making you too tired to think about sex. These effects may last for a few weeks after radiotherapy has finished and can be very distressing. Internal or external radiotherapy to the pelvis to treat bladder, rectal or prostate cancer may cause impotence. This may develop months or even years after your radiotherapy is finished. It can help to talk openly to your partner about your 44Understanding radiotherapy problems. You can also ask the radiotherapy staff about any problems or concerns you have. There are a number practical ways to help overcome impotence and these are discussed in detail in our booklet Sexuality and cancer. Contraception It's very important for women of childbearing age to use effective contraception throughout their radiotherapy treatment. Radiotherapy could cause a miscarriage or cause a child to be born with a low birth weight or abnormalities. If you think you may be pregnant before you start your radiotherapy treatment, it's very important to let your clinical oncologist know. If you are pregnant, they will discuss with you whether the treatment can be delayed until the baby is born.45 Understanding radiotherapy Effects of radiotherapy on fertility Effects on women Most radiotherapy treatment has no effect on your ability to have children unless the ovaries are included in the treatment area. Many healthy babies have been born to women who have had radiotherapy. The risk of having a baby with health problems is not increased if you have had treatment in the past. Many cancer specialists recommend that women wait for about two years after having radiotherapy before trying to get pregnant. This is to give the body a chance to get over the effects of the cancer and its treatment. If radiotherapy treatment is given for cancer of the cervix, womb or ovary and includes the ovaries, temporary or permanent infertility is likely. This can be very difficult to come to terms with (see page 48). Effects on men In men, sperm production can be reduced if the testicles are in the area being treated, and this can lead to temporary or permanent infertility. Fortunately, it's usually possible to avoid giving radiotherapy to the testicles when treating cancers that are common in younger men. Radiotherapy for prostate or bladder cancer is likely to cause permanently low sperm counts, which can reduce your fertility.46Understanding radiotherapy 47 Understanding radiotherapy Information about fertility Before you have radiotherapy, your clinical oncologist should discuss the risk of infertility with you. They'll normally ask you to sign a form consenting to treatment. Understandably, this can be a traumatic time, particularly for young people who were planning to have children. If you have a partner, they will be encouraged to join this meeting, giving both of you a chance to discuss any concerns you have. We can send you a booklet called Relationships, sex and fertility for young people affected by cancer . Sperm banking and egg storage Sometimes it may be possible for men to store sperm before they have radiotherapy. The sperm are frozen and can be stored for several years until you and your partner are ready to have children. This is called sperm banking . Before treatment starts women may be able to store fertilised eggs (embryos) using sperm from a partner. It can take between 4-6 weeks to collect the eggs so this won't be possible if treatment needs to start straight away. It's now sometimes possible to store a woman's unfertilised eggs, although this is still experimental and the service is not widely available. We can send you information about cancer treatment and fertility.48Understanding radiotherapy Contraception Even if your treatment is likely to make you infertile, you may still be advised to use a reliable form of birth control. If pregnancy occurs during or shortly after radiotherapy, there is a possibility of damage to the baby. Feelings about sexuality and infertility It's not easy to come to terms with the prospect of infertility, or with the other side effects of treatment. It will take a while for you to come to terms with your feelings and be able to talk about them. When you're ready, it may help to talk openly to your partner, a relative or friend about your feelings. If they can understand how you feel, it will probably be easier for them to help and support you. Some people prefer to talk to someone they don't know. Support groups offer you the chance to talk to other people who have been through a similar experience. Our cancer support specialists can tell you about groups in your area. Another possibility is to talk things over with a counsellor. Your hospital may offer a counselling service or our cancer support specialists can tell you how to contact a counsellor - call us free on 0808 808 00 00 .49 Understanding radiotherapy Long-term side effects of radiotherapy All cancer treatments can result in long-term side effects. Modern ways of giving radiotherapy are designed to limit the chance of permanent side effects as much as possible, and very few people develop long-term problems. If you're concerned about the risk of developing particular side effects from radiotherapy, it's best to speak to your clinical oncologist before your treatment starts. Possible long-term side effects Here we discuss some of the long-term side effects that can occur, but they will depend on the part of the body that was treated, so you won't necessarily experience all of them. Long-term side effects can take months and sometimes years to develop: Hair loss can be permanent or new hair growth may be a different colour or texture to what it was before. The skin can feel different or may be darker than before. Infertility can occur if the ovaries or testicles are within the treatment area. Swelling in a limb or on the body (lymphoedema) can develop when lymph nodes are damaged during treatment. Red 'spidery' marks (telangectasia) may appear on the skin because small blood vessels are damaged, but this is very rare.50Understanding radiotherapy Shortness of breath can happen, as radiotherapy can make the lungs less stretchy. Narrowing of the vagina can occur (see page 43). Difficulty swallowing can occur due to a narrowing of the gullet (oesophagus) or reduced amounts of saliva. Passing a lot of urine can sometimes happen if the bladder becomes less stretchy after radiotherapy. Second cancers Radiotherapy can cause cancer, and a small number of people will develop a second cancer because of the treatment they've had. However, the chance of a second cancer developing is so small that the risks of having radiotherapy are far outweighed by the benefits. If you're concerned about your risk of developing a second cancer, discuss your worries with your cancer specialist. We can send you further information about infertility, lymphoedema and the long-term side effects of pelvic radiotherapy. 51 Understanding radiotherapy Specialised external radiotherapy techniques Conformal radiotherapy Many radiotherapy departments known conformal radiotherapy . Conformal radiotherapy uses the same radiotherapy machine as normal radiotherapy treatment. However, inside the machine is a device called a multi-leaf collimator , which allows the beam of radiation to be shaped very precisely so that it 'conforms' to the area of the cancer. As a result, the healthy surrounding cells and nearby structures receive a lower dose of radiation, so the possibility of side effects is reduced. Conformal radiotherapy may be used to treat a number of different cancers, including cancers of the head and neck, prostate, gullet (oesophagus), some types of lung cancer, breast cancer and brain tumours. It is especially useful if the tumour is close to important organs or structures in the body, because high doses of radiotherapy can be given with minimal risk to the healthy tissue. Although conformal radiotherapy is commonly used to treat some types of cancer, research is being carried out to see whether it can help to control other types of cancer better than standard radiotherapy, and cause fewer side effects. Your cancer specialist can tell you if conformal radiotherapy would be IMRT) also uses a multi-leaf collimator. During this treatment, parts of the multi-leaf collimator are moved while the treatment is given. This enables the treatment beams to be shaped very precisely and allows the dose of radiotherapy to be altered in different parts of the treatment area. Again, the aim is to reduce the side effects of treatment. Total body irradiation (TBI) This type of radiotherapy is used much less often than other types of radiotherapy, but may be given to people who are having a stem cell transplant as part of their treatment. A large single dose, or 6 -8 smaller doses, of radiation is given to the whole body to destroy the cells of the bone marrow. Very high doses of chemotherapy are also given. The treatment is followed by giving stem cells (cells that develop into white blood cells, red blood cells and platelets) by a drip into a vein, to replace the bone marrow that has been destroyed. This type of radiotherapy is described in our booklets Understanding allogeneic (donor) stem cell transplants and Understanding high-dose treatment with stem cell support. Proton therapy Proton therapy can be used to treat cancers affecting the back of the eye, such as melanoma. It is given using a machine called a Cyclotron . The cyclotron uses proton radiation 53 Understanding radiotherapy rather than x-rays to kill the cancer cells. The proton beam is aimed directly at the cancer and causes very little damage to surrounding healthy tissues. Some very rare cancers, such as tumours affecting the base of the skull or the spine, can be treated with high-energy proton therapy. There are plans to develop this treatment in the UK, but it is not currently available. However, the Department of Health can arrange for people who need this type of radiation to have it at centres in the USA or Europe, paid for by the NHS. Stereotactic radiosurgery This treatment involves the use of many beams of radiation, each giving a low dose to the tumour. This is used instead of normal treatment that uses just one or a few beams of radiation giving much higher doses. Again, the aim is to give a high dose of radiation to the cancer but a low dose to normal tissues, reducing side effects. There are also claims that the treatment targets the cancer more accurately than normal radiotherapy. The treatment is given by special types of radiotherapy machines, such as the CyberKnife \u00ae and Gamma Knife\u00ae. There are very few of these machines in the UK, and research is underway to see if they do offer any advantage over normal treatment. Intra-operative radiotherapy This uses a special machine to give a single dose of radiation in the operating theatre at the time a cancer is removed. A recent clinical trial has suggested this could be an alternative for women with early breast cancer who would normally have a course of radiotherapy over several weeks following surgery. 54Understanding radiotherapy At the moment it's only available at one hospital in the UK. and it's uncertain whether it will become more widely available in the future. Research - clinical trials Cancer research trials are carried out to try to find new and better treatments for cancer. Trials that are carried out on patients are known as clinical trials. Trials are the only reliable way to find out if a different type of radiotherapy, or other treatment is better than what is already available. Taking part in a trial You may be asked to take part in a treatment research trial, and there can be many benefits in doing this. Trials help to improve knowledge about cancer and develop new treatments. You will be carefully monitored during and after the study. Usually several hospitals around the country take part in these trials. It's important to bear in mind that some treatments that look promising at first are often later found not to be as good as existing treatments, or to have side effects that outweigh the benefits. If you decide not to take part in a trial your decision will be respected and you do not have to give a reason. There will be no change in the way that you are treated by the hospital staff and you will be offered the standard treatment for your situation. 55 Understanding radiotherapy The process of clinical trials is described in more detail in our booklet Understanding cancer research trials (clinical trials). Blood and tumour samples Blood, bone marrow or tumour samples may be taken to help make the right diagnosis. You may be asked for your permission to use some of your samples for research into cancer. If you take part in a trial you may also give other samples, which will be frozen and stored for future use when new research techniques become available. Your name will be removed from the samples so you can't be identified. The research may be carried out at the hospital where you are treated or at another one. This type of research takes a long time, and results may not be available for many years. The samples will be used to increase knowledge about the causes of cancer and its treatment, which will hopefully improve the outlook for future patients. Our website macmillan.org.uk has information about current clinical trial databases. 56Understanding radiotherapy Complementary therapies Complementary therapies can help improve your quality of life and well-being, and can sometimes help reduce the side effects of radiotherapy. Many people find that complementary therapies or practices help them feel stronger and more confident in dealing with radiotherapy. These therapies can often be used alongside conventional treatments and medicines. Some complementary therapies, such as meditation or visualisation, can be done by the person with cancer themselves to help reduce anxiety. Other therapies, such as gentle massage, can be carried out by relatives or carers, and can help them support the person with cancer. Physical contact and touch can be among the most powerful forms of support for people who are faced with uncertainty, fear or pain, whether emotional or physical. Touching someone gently can also express how much you care about them. Some hospitals offer complementary therapies alongside conventional care. These may include: aromatherapy art therapy colour and sound therapy massage reflexology relaxation, visualisation or guided imagery techniques acupuncture.57 Understanding radiotherapy 58Understanding radiotherapy It's important to tell your clinical oncologist if you are planning to have any form of complementary therapy. We have a booklet about complementary therapies. After treatment The positive effects of radiotherapy may take some time to show. People sometimes expect to be given an x-ray or scan at the end of their treatment to see if it has worked. However, in many cases the tumour may take some time to shrink and the radiotherapy may cause some inflammation, which means that x-rays and scans may not be helpful at this time. How well the radiotherapy has worked will usually be assessed when you go to your first follow-up appointment, which is about 4-6 weeks after the treatment has finished. Follow-up After your treatment has finished you will have regular follow-up appointments. These may be at the radiotherapy department or at your original hospital. How often you have check-ups will vary depending on your type of cancer and on your hospital, but as time goes by these appointments will become less frequent. Your clinical oncologist will keep in touch with your GP (family doctor) so they know how you're progressing. Follow-up appointments are a good opportunity to discuss any problems or worries you have. It may help to make a list of questions beforehand so you don't forget anything important.59 Understanding radiotherapy If you have any problems or notice any new symptoms in between appointments, tell your clinical oncologist as soon as possible. You don't have to wait until your next scheduled appointment - just ask for an earlier one. Many people find that they get very anxious for a while before their appointments. This is natural and it may help to get support from family, friends or one of the organisations listed on pages 71-75 during this time. Your feelings It can be very difficult to try to come to terms with not only with the illness itself, but also with the treatments and possible side effects. 'During my radiotherapy I became very emotional. I would start crying for no reason.' People may experience different emotions while having radiotherapy treatment - you may feel low or weepy at times. These emotions are shared by many people who have radiotherapy or any treatment for cancer. Many people who have radiotherapy will already have had some cancer treatment; for others it may be the beginning of a long treatment period. Radiotherapy can also cause physical changes, such as the menopause or hair loss, which can be very distressing. Sometimes the hardest thing to cope with is when treatment finishes. You and your family and friends will probably see this 60Understanding radiotherapy as the time to get back to normal, but recovery time varies. No one can say for sure how long it will take you to get over the physical and emotional side effects. The end of the visits to hospital for treatment can leave you feeling alone and neglected. Many people find they feel very low and emotional at this time, when they had expected to be able to put the cancer and the treatment behind them. We all have our own ways of coping. Some people have a close network of family and friends who give emotional support. Others would rather seek help from people who are not involved in their illness. Either way, it's important to know that support is available if you need it. You can ask at the hospital if help is available locally, or contact one of the organisations listed on pages 71-75. You can also call one of our cancer support specialists free on 0808 808 00 00 . Some people find it helpful to talk through their feelings with a trained counsellor (see page 12). We have several booklets you may find helpful: Lost for words - how to talk to someone with cancer is a booklet for relatives and friends of people with cancer. It looks at some of the difficulties people may have when talking about cancer and suggests ways of overcoming them. Talking about your cancer suggests simple, practical ways to help you talk about your needs and feelings.The emotional effects of cancer discusses the different emotions that may occur and has tips on dealing with them.61 Understanding radiotherapy Work You may need to take time off work during your treatment and for a while afterwards. It can be hard to judge the best time to go back to work or whether to go back at all. Your decision is likely to depend mainly on the type of work you do and how much your income is affected. It's important to do what is right for you. Getting back into your normal routine can be very helpful and you may want to go back to work as soon as possible. Many people find that going back to work as soon as they feel strong enough gives them a chance to put their worries to one side by becoming involved with their job and colleagues again. It can help to talk to your employer about the situation - it may be possible for you to work part-time or job share. On the other hand, it can take a long time to recover fully from treatment for cancer, and it may be many months before you feel ready to return to work. It's important not to feel pressurised into taking on too much, too soon. If you have a disability caused by the cancer, your employer can get specialist help to enable you to work. Our booklets Work and cancer and Self-employment and cancer give information about employment rights, disability rights and financial issues for people with cancer. We also have a booklet called Working while caring for someone with cancer .62Understanding radiotherapy Financial help and benefits If you are employed and unable to work, your employer can pay you Statutory Sick Pay (SSP) for a maximum of 28 weeks. If you are still unable to work after this period, you may be able to claim Employment and Support Allowance (ESA). There are two parts to ESA: a contributory part, which is dependent on how much national insurance you have paid, and a means-tested part, which is dependent on your income and savings. You may get either or both parts. ESA is paid at a basic rate for the first 13 weeks. During this time you'll have to take part in a work capability assessment and attend a work-focused interview. After the 13-week period you'll be assessed and placed into one of two groups. If you are found to have limited capability for work you'll be placed in the support group, and if you are found not to have limited capability for work you'll be placed in the work-related activity group. If you are receiving intravenous (by injection into a vein) chemotherapy, you will automatically be assessed as having limited capability for work and will be placed in the support group. People in the work-related activity group will have to attend five more work-focused interviews, which aim to help them get back into work. An additional payment will be paid to anyone in the support group, and a small additional payment will be paid to anyone in the work-related activity group. If you are self-employed you can claim ESA as long as you have paid the correct level of national insurance contributions. 63 Understanding radiotherapy People who have not paid these may qualify for ESA under the means-tested route. If you are ill and not able to claim, remember to ask your GP for a medical certificate for the period of your illness. If you are in hospital, ask your doctor or nurse for a certificate to cover the time that you are an inpatient. This is necessary if you need to claim a benefit. You may qualify for Disability Living Allowance (DLA) if you are under 65 or for Attendance Allowance (AA) if you are over 65. There is a fast-track claim for people who may not live longer than six months. People who claim under this 'special rule' need to get their doctor to complete a form for either benefit. It's impossible to tell exactly how long someone may live, and many people with advanced cancer may be entitled to this benefit. Special rules payments of AA and the DLA care component are reviewed after three years. Information about benefits and financial help For more information about benefits and financial support please call us on 0808 808 00 00 . You may also find our booklet Help with the cost of cancer useful. You can find out more about benefits from your local Citizens Advice or by calling the Benefit Enquiry Line on 0800 882 200 . You can also visit the Department for Work and Pensions website at dwp.gov.uk 64Understanding radiotherapy Direct payments If your assessment shows you need social services, you may be entitled to get direct payments from your local authority. This means that you are given payments to organise social services yourself, rather than the local social services paying for and organising them for you. You can get more information about direct payments from the Department of Health website at dh.gov.uk or from your local authority. Insurance After having treatment for cancer, it can be more difficult to get life or travel insurance. An independent financial adviser (IFA) can help you with life insurance and can find the best deal for your particular situation. You can find a local IFA by referral from family or friends, looking in your phone book, or by contacting the Personal Finance Society or Independent Financial Advisers Promotions (IFAP). See page 75. We can send you more information about travel and cancer. We also have a booklet about getting travel insurance, which has a list of companies who offer insurance to people with medical conditions including cancer. This information is also on our website.65 Understanding radiotherapy Children and radiotherapy Radiotherapy can be a frightening experience for both children and their parents, but once everyone understands what is involved this fear can be reduced. The radiotherapy staff are used to treating children and can offer help and support. Young children, especially those aged three or younger, may have their treatment under a mild general anaesthetic. You'll probably have a morning appointment, as your child can't eat or drink for at least four hours before their treatment. The anaesthetic is usually given in the radiotherapy department by an anaesthetist. You can stay with your child until they are asleep. Although you won't be able to stay in the radiotherapy room during your child's treatment, you can watch through the window or on the TV screen. The nurses will look after your child until they wake up, usually after 20-60 minutes. You will then both be able to go home unless your child is an inpatient, in which case a nurse will take them back to the ward. Older children may take a while to get used to the size and sound of the machines, but this should get easier once they get to know the staff and the surroundings. If you're finding it difficult to cope with your child's illness, you may find it helpful to contact a children's cancer group. Sharing your experiences with other parents can help you cope with your own problems and fears. Call our Macmillan Support Line on 0808 808 00 00 for details of these groups. You may find our booklet A parent's guide to children's cancer useful. We also have fact sheets about radiotherapy treatment in children.66Understanding radiotherapy We have a wide variety of services and activities that might be of help and interest.
