At this month's checkup, your doctor will take a close look at your child's development and administer a round of essential shots. The physical checkup The doctor will once again complete a full physical examination of your child, including a dental check. If those [first molars](//www.whattoexpect.com/toddler/grooming/toddler-teething-relief.aspx) haven't cut through yet \u2014 ouch! \u2014 they may soon be on their way. Developmental milestones Has your little one tried taking those first wobbly solo steps? Or is she off and running? Or still at a standstill? Every child follows her own developmental timetable. Some zoom ahead socially, others physically, and still others seem to understand everything (receptive language) but say nothing (expressive language). Here are some skills the doctor may check for this month: [[1]](javascript:void(0)) [Understanding simple commands](//www.whattoexpect.com/toddler/understand-directions/) - Clapping when she's excited [Pointing](//www.whattoexpect.com/first-year/wave-clap/)to get what she wants and to show you something interesting [Stacking small objects](//www.whattoexpect.com/first-year/fine-motor-skills/), like blocks - Using her fingers to [feed herself](//www.whattoexpect.com/first-year/feeding-baby/baby-self-feeding/)some food [Saying one or two words](//www.whattoexpect.com/first-year/first-words/), not including \"mama\" or \"dada\" Remember, every child is one-of-a-kind \u2014 and there's a wide range of normal when it comes to development. If you're concerned about something in your toddler's development or if you just have a nagging feeling something's not quite right, speak up. Also check in if your child seems to have lost skills she already mastered (especially verbal or social skills), isn't gaining skills (like adding new words), shows little affection or joyful emotions, or has picked up repetitive or unusual actions, like spinning or flapping her arms. Something else to ask about: if your toddler hasn't spoken a word by the time she's 16 months old. More About Your Toddler 15-month shots This checkup is a big one when it comes to [immunizations](//www.whattoexpect.com/first-year/child-immunizations/) \u2014 that is, unless your toddler already had these shots at the [12-month visit](//www.whattoexpect.com/first-year/health-and-safety/12-month-well-baby-visit/). Remember some of these vaccines are given in a series and your little one needs all of the recommended doses. To distract her from any pain, cuddle her (which research has shown results in less crying) while you sing a song or read from a favorite book. And don't forget to heap on the praise (and maybe a sticker or two) when it's over. If your child didn't get the following vaccinations recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) at the 12-month visit, now's the time: [[2]](javascript:void(0)) [Hib](//www.whattoexpect.com/first-year/vaccinations/hib-vaccine/)(haemophilus influenzae type (measles, mumps and rubella)](//www.whattoexpect.com/first-year/vaccinations/mmr-vaccine/) [PCV 13 (pneumococcal dose in this series [Varicella (chicken pox)](//www.whattoexpect.com/first-year/vaccinations/varicella-vaccine/) Your toddler may also get the following shots now or at a later visit: If it's flu season, your doctor may recommend a [flu shot](//www.whattoexpect.com/first-year/vaccinations/influenza-vaccine-flu-shot/), which all children aged 6 months and up should get once a year. (Two doses, four weeks apart, are needed if your toddler has never received the flu vaccine.) The [COVID-19 vaccine](//www.whattoexpect.com/news/first-year/covid19-vaccine-babies-children) is also recommended for everyone 6 months and up, so if your child hasn't gotten it yet, ask the pediatrician about getting her immunized. It'll help protect her from serious illness. [[3]](javascript:void(0)) Questions to ask your doctor As you serve a variety of new solid foods to entice your adventurous eater, diarrhea or constipation can sometimes happen, so let your doctor know if your toddler's bowel habits have changed and ask if there are ways to help. Here are other questions you may want to bring up at the 15-month well-child visit: - Should my toddler be drinking any [juice](//www.whattoexpect.com/toddler-nutrition/drinks-for-toddlers.aspx)? - How can I get my toddler to drink [milk](//www.whattoexpect.com/toddler/eating-and-nutrition/introducing-cows-milk)? - What do I do if my child won't eat any [vegetables](//www.whattoexpect.com/toddler-nutrition/getting-kids-to-eat-vegetables.aspx)? - My child clings to me all the time.
