Lancet Microbe ; 3(12): e944-e955, Dec. infection versus COVID-19 [vaccination]is important for informing [vaccine]mandate decisions. We compared [protection]conferred by natural [infection]versus that from the [BNT162b2](Pfizer-BioNTech) and [Qatar]. METHODS:We conducted two matched retrospective [cohort studies]that emulated target trials. Data were obtained from the national federated databases for COVID-19 [vaccination], [SARS-CoV-2 testing], [pandemic]onset in [Qatar]) and May 12, 2022. We matched individuals with a documented primary [infection]and no [vaccination] [record](natural [infection]cohort) with individuals [who]had received two doses (primary series) of the same [vaccine]( [BNT162b2]-vaccinated or [mRNA-1273]-vaccinated cohorts) at the start of follow-up (90 days after the primary [infection]). Individuals were exact matched (11) by [sex], 10-year natural [infection]cohorts was compared with [incidence]in the vaccinated cohorts, using Cox proportional [hazards]regression models with [adjustment]for matching factors. FINDINGS:Between Jan 5, 2021 of second- [dose] [vaccine]roll-out) 12, 2022, individuals vaccinated with [BNT162b2]and 61\u00e2955 individuals vaccinated with [mRNA-1273]were matched to unvaccinated individuals with a documented primary [infection]. During follow-up, 7123 SARS-CoV-2 infections were recorded in the [BNT162b2]-vaccinated cohort and 3583 [reinfections]were recorded in the matched natural [infection]cohort. 4282 SARS-CoV-2 infections were recorded in the [mRNA-1273]-vaccinated cohort and 2301 [reinfections]were recorded in the matched natural [infection]cohort. The overall adjusted [hazard]ratio (HR) for SARS-CoV-2 infection was (95% previous natural [infection]versus [mRNA-1273] [vaccination]. The overall adjusted HR for severe (acute care hospitalisations), critical ( [intensive care unit]hospitalisations), or fatal COVID-19 previous natural [infection]versus previous natural [infection]versus [mRNA-1273] [vaccination]. Severe, critical, or fatal COVID-19 was rare in both the natural [infection]and vaccinated cohorts. INTERPRETATION:Previous natural [infection]was associated with lower [incidence]of SARS-CoV-2 infection, regardless of the variant, than [mRNA]primary-series [vaccination]. [Vaccination]remains the safest and most optimal tool for protecting against [infection]and COVID-19-related "}
