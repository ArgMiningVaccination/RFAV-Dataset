OM I have been an Acupuncturist at Hennepin Healthcare since 2018, and have been in the field since 2013. I truly love serving our diverse patient population here at Hennepin, and the ability to collaborate care with a wide range of providers. I have a special interest in acupuncture for prenatal care and postpartum recovery, and I am also passionate about nutrition. I love to incorporate ancestral based nutritional guidelines into my practice, based on the healthy habits of indigenous cultures worldwide over the last 100 years. Education and training - Continuing education, primarily in pre and postpartum care and nutrition - Master's degree in Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine, Northwestern Health Sciences University, Bloomington, MN Tara Schug, DC I joined Hennepin Healthcare at the North Loop clinic in 2018. To me, Chiropractic has largely been inaccessible for a large majority of the population and Hennepin really drew me because we serve a large population of people who may otherwise not have access to care. The Integrative Health and Wellness Division has been fantastic about creating a collaborative approach, not just to pain management, but to individual wellness. The main focus of much of my post-graduate education has been on lifestyle and nutritional changes that can really help assist in reducing acute and chronic pain along with the manual therapies that chiropractors are more widely associated with. The approach to care is about empowering people in their goals to reduce pain and feel better. I like to introduce lifestyle shifts in small increments so they become easy habits and don't seem like a long laundry list of inaccessible to-do's.
