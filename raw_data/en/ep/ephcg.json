The MindBody approach to behavioral health, which stems from the MindBody Care model, is a holistic approach to healing and wellness that focuses on self-healing, optimal wellness, the relationship between the body and the mind, and doctor-patient relationships. Rather than relying solely on medication to alter the patient's mental state, the MindBody approach invites alternative systems of medicine and healing practices into the treatment plan. By strengthening the mind and body's natural healing processes, the patient is able to achieve physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual wellness. These accomplishments manifest in the acceptance of self and others, self-awareness, and optimal dietary habits. Mind-body techniques, designed to promote mindfulness, can include any of the following: - Yoga breathing skills - Yoga of inner well being - Fitness counseling - Nutritional counseling - Meditation - Cognitive-behavioral therapies - Group support - Psychodynamic psychotherapy - Spiritual awareness cultivation Regular meditation is one of the best-known and highly effective practices of the MindBody approach because it has been found to increase levels of self-awareness, intuition, and spiritual development. Recent studies also suggest that meditation is capable of activating certain parts of the brain, such as the amygdala, which is associated with processing emotion. Various types of mediation exist, including breathing meditation, walking meditation, mindfulness meditation, and mantra meditation.
