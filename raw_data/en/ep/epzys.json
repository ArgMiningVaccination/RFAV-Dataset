They should not be relied on to guide clinical practice or health-related behavior and should not be reported in news media as established information. Preprints posted online allow authors to receive rapid feedback and the entire scientific community can appraise the work for themselves and respond appropriately. Those comments are posted alongside the preprints for anyone to read them and serve as a post publication assessment. Assessing Durability of Vaccine Effect Following Blinded Crossover in COVID-19 Vaccine Efficacy Trials Preprint En | PREPRINT-MEDRXIV | ID: ppmedrxiv-20248137 BackgroundSeveral large-scale phase 3 placebo-controlled randomized clinical trials and some have demonstrated substantial short-term [efficacy]. Efficacious [vaccines]should, at some point, be offered to placebo participants, which [will]occur before long-term [efficacy]and [safety]are known. MethodsFollowing [vaccination]of the placebo group, we show that placebo-controlled [vaccine] [efficacy]can be derived by assuming the benefit of [vaccination]over [time]has the same profile for the original [vaccine]recipients and the placebo crossovers. This reconstruction allows estimation of both [vaccine]durability and potential [vaccine]-associated enhanced [disease]. ResultsPost-crossover estimates of [vaccine] [efficacy]can provide insights about durability, identify waning [efficacy], and identify late enhancement of [disease], but are less reliable estimates than those obtained by a standard trial where the placebo cohort is maintained. As [vaccine] [efficacy]estimates for post-crossover periods depend on prior [vaccine] [efficacy]estimates, longer pre-crossover periods with higher case counts provide better estimates of late [vaccine] [efficacy]. Further, open-label crossover may [lead]to blinded crossover and continued follow-up of trial participants to best assess [vaccine]durability and potential delayed enhancement of [disease]. This approach allows placebo recipients timely access to the [vaccine]when it would no longer be proper to maintain participants on placebo, yet still allows important insights about "}
