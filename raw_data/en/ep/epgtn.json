The College of Psychology (COP ) is committed to providing the highest quality educational experience to current and future psychologists and mental health and counseling professionals. REV. 12/20 PAGE 4 This training experience provides students with a sophisticated understanding of psychological research and the delivery of superior mental health care . COP is located on the main campus of Nova Southeastern Uni versity. T he COP has 4 2 full-time faculty and offers two APA -accredited doctoral programs in clinical psychology (Ph.D. and Psy. D.), a s well as an APA -accredited doctoral program in school psychology. Master' s programs in counseling (online), general psychology, mental health counseling, and school counseling, and a speciali st program in school psychology are also offered . COP offers a Continuing Education program series approved by APA, the National Association of School Psychologists, and the Florida Bo ards of Licensed Clinical Social Workers, Marriage and Family Therapy, and Mental Health Counseling. COP is also approved to offer continuing education by the State of Florida Board of Medical Therapies/Psychology, Office of School Psychology and is an NBC C-Approved Continuing Education Provider (ACEP) . The SFCIP is governed through an Executive Boar d (EB) which is chaired by the Director of Internship Training and its members include the Dean of the College of Psychology (COP ), the SFCIP Chief Psychologis t, and a member -at-large (a supervisor from one of the partner sites) . The EB has the authority and responsibility for maintaining SFCIP compliance with the standards of accreditation of the American Psychological Association (APA) and the membership guide lines of the Association of Psychology Postdoctoral and Internship Centers (APPIC) . The Executive Board maintains SFCIP resources, evaluates prospective partner sites for new or continued participation in the SFCIP, and ensures the quality of the clinical supervision within the internship. The Executive Board also has supervision, control and direction over the property, business and affairs of the SFCIP and determines its standards, policies, and procedures, and any changes to these. An Operations Board also chaired by the Director of Internship Training and is comprised of at least one representative from each member site (usually a primary supervisor), the SFCIP Chief Psychologist , as well as an intern representative serves as the management arm of the Executive Board. This committee has the authority and responsibility for ensuring the quality of the SFCIP training program. The Operations Board meets at least quarterly to assist t he Director of Internship Training with intern selection, intern training and evaluation, and program monitoring, evaluation, and improvement. PROGRAM AIM AND COMPETENCIES The SFCIP follows the Practitioner Informed by Science Model of training, which adhe res to a philosophy of training geared toward pr eparing interns to enter careers as health service psychologists concerned primarily with direct service delivery informed by the research base. The SFCIP encourages the acquisition of \"generalist\" skills rat her than narrowly defined specialties with an understanding that health service psychology competencies may be attained in specialized settings. The program is designed to provide experiential training and supervision focused on attainment of profession -wide competencies . These are balanced with formal instruction and mentoring in a broad base of clinical knowledge and skills during supervision and weekly training activities throughout the internship year . The SFCIP seeks to develop strong mentoring relatio nships between supervisors and interns. These relationships enhance the intern's personal and professional growth by foster ing the development of profession -wide competencies . REV. 12/20 PAGE 5 The SFCIP is a post -practicum, post -coursework, intensive clinical training program designed as the capstone experience for doctoral psychology students as they move toward greater autonomy in practicing health service psychology. The aim of the SFCIP is t o prepare interns for entry level independent practice and licensure as Health Service Psychologists. To this end, a ll SFCIP interns will develop proficiency in all areas of profession -wide competency including : I.

PROGRAM DESCRIPTION The South Flor ida Consortium Internship Program (SFCIP) is a collaborative effort of Nova Southeastern University and cooperating agencies whose mission is to offer a full-time 12 -month (2000 -hour) doctoral internship for qualified doctoral students in clinical psychology. The goal of the SFCIP is to train and educate interns to competently practice health service psychology. Interns are prepared to be lifelong consumers of research who provide direct services with an understanding that science informs sound prac tice. Upon completion of the internship, the intern will have acquired the knowledge, skills and professionalism to move to the postdoctoral resident level and work as health service psychologists at the entry level . SFCIP members are committed to provi ding interns with the opportunity to acquire \"generalist\" skills through the provision of instruction, supervision, and experience in a wide spectrum of functions engaged in by a health service psychologist. Therefore, at all training sites, each intern is provided with supervised training experiences in the direct provision of assessment/evaluation and intervention services to clinical populations, as well as with consultation and supervision activities. Training in a breadth of clinical issues and ethica l and legal professional standards is incorporated into supervision and seminars (Appendix A) to further prepare interns for generalist practice and the highest standards of professional conduct. The SFCIP's primary training method is experiential. Interns spend 40 hours per week in training of which a minimum of 25% (ten hours) to a maximum of 24 hours of the intern's time is dedicated to direct clinical services. At times, because of special circumstances, the maximum number of hours may be increased w ith the written approv al of the Director of Training. Interns are responsible for documenting their direct and indirect services monthly by completing the Intern Activity L og (Appendix B ), obtaining supervisor's signature, and submitting the log to the Director of Internship Training monthly. The community -based training sites that form the SFCIP provide an array of clinically and culturally diverse populations that offer our interns supervised clinical training and experience during a one -year placement at one of the consortium partner sites, supplemented by weekly training activities at NSU . Nevertheless, all SFCIP interns are expected to develop proficiency in the execution of a broad range of intervention , assessment, consultation, program evaluation, and supervision skills within community settings (i.e., Consortium partner sites). While some sites serve special populations (e.g., clients with primary diagnoses of eating disorders or medical conditions ) allowing the interns exposure to spe cialist skills, t he SFCIP program as a whole is organized to provide generalist training through (a) experiential training, (b) supervision, and (c) REV. 12/20 PAGE 7 training seminars; therefore, all SFCIP interns are required to gain experience in the following areas: 1. Assessment : Interns generally complete clinical interview s and or screening regularly to provide a means of refining diagnostic and treatment planning skills. All interns complete a minimum of 6 psychological evaluations during the year under the supervision of a licensed psychologist . Interns will document each completed evaluation by entering the date of the evaluation and obtaining their supervisor's signature of the Documentation of Completed Reports form (Appendix C). While the evaluation type, instruments, and report length may vary across sites, all SFCIP interns' evaluations must include, at minimum, the following: history, direct observation, formal assessment instruments and integration of all individual components to yield diagnostic impres sions and recommendations. Also, there are opportunities for consultation with multiple supervisors regarding assessment and report writing and exposure to a broad range of assessment instruments and report writing skills from weekly seminars. 2. Intervention : All SFCIP interns are assigned a diverse client case load and work in a variety of modalities (e.g., individual, marital, family, and group therapy , etc. ). Cases are representative of diverse socioeconomic backgrounds, ethnic /racial and gende r identities , sexual orientations, religions, disabilities, and presenting problems . During individual and group supervision and weekly seminars, interns are exposed to a broad base of knowledge and skills including a variety of intervention models and tec hniques, service delivery approaches, and culturally competent interventions . 3. Consultation: Interns participate in supervised consultation activities with other professionals. This may include staff in -service training and/or consultation within interpro fessional teams and/or setting s. 4. Supervision: Interns have the opportunity to provide individual and group supervision to practicum students, who are in turn, supervised by the psychology training staff. At sites where there are no practicum s tudents, int erns provide supervision /mentoring and/or training t o other staff at their sites. 5. Research: Consortium -wide, interns participate in program e valuation didactics and a Logic Model group project to enhance their knowledge and skills in this area (see Appendix D). Interns must include a critical review of the research literature in their intern presentations (see Appendix F) ). Supervision includes discussions about the empirical support for an array of assessment and intervention approaches used with clients and interns will be exposed to a broad array of clinical/scientific knowledge during weekly training activities (e.g., PD, Grand Rounds and intern presentations). REV. 12/20 PAGE 8 A. Consortium Partner Sites : Broward Health Medical Center (BHMC) - Maria Fimiani, Psy.D. A respected leader in healthcare since its founding in 1938, Broward Health Medical Center's mission has remained constant over the decades: to provide quality healthcare to the people we serve and support the needs of all physicians and employees. BHMC continues to deliver on that promise through its commitment to physician excellence, technological advancement , and academic affiliation. Caring for our community goes far beyond the walls of the medical center. Each year, BHMC admits appro ximately 24,000 patients, delivers 4 ,000 babies and handles more than 75,000 emergencies. BHMC is a Level I Trauma Center and is an accredited hospital by the Joint Commission. This internship offers training in the areas of Clinical and Health Psychology and prepares interns for careers as practitioners in medical or applied practice settings . Interns will gain knowledge regarding organ systems, disease processes, laboratory results, medications, and the interplay between physical and mental health . Intern s will also have a variety of clinical experiences in trauma services, pediatrics, behavioral health, emergency medicine, family medicine, oncology, organ transplantation, palliative care, and cardiac & pulmonary rehabilitation programs. Additionally, Inte rns will complete a minimum of 6 psychological batteries as a part of the pre - transplant evaluation process. Interns are required to be on -call 24/7 at least 1 week/weekend a month via pager coverage . Interns provide services to patients who are medically compromised, experiencing end of life issues , and undergoing invasive medical procedures. Depending on availability, interns may be able to view a liver transplant or other surgeries. Interns will also have opportunities to participate in community relat ed mental health support activities, research, grant writing, programmatic development, and the training of medical students and residents. Interns will be trained in the supervision of practicum students and utilize a variety of supervision strategies inc luding direct shadowing of psychology consults, review of audio recordings of psychotherapy sessions, providing ongoing feedback, conducting in -service trainings, and participating in their formal evaluation process. The patient population is richly di verse with respect to age, race, ethnicity, cultural background, sexual orientation, socioeconomic status, medical conditions, and psychopathology. Interns will work with a variety of multidisciplinary teams throughout the medical center and across program s, and will rotate with their intern peers in attend ing weekly medical team rounds. All interns will rotate through a three -month pediatric psychology placement as part of the internship program. This placement is supervised by Jessica M. Valenzuela, Ph.D. and will include participation in multidisciplinary outpatient clinics in pediatric endocrinology with a focus on youth with diabetes as well as youth with ob esity and related complications. Interns will work alongside physician specialists and allied health professionals to provide integrated services. They will conduct brief assessment, consultation, intervention, and make necessary referrals during clinic. Interns may also conduct short -term outpatient psychotherapy for issues related to the patient's medical diagnosis (e.g., adherence, coping, lifestyle change) and have opportunities for REV. 12/20 PAGE 9 youth and/or parent group therapy. Interns will consult directly wit h the medical team. Live supervision will be provided . BHMC offers weekly lectures, presentations, and Grand Rounds, which Interns are encouraged to attend. Interns will also attend a weekly one-hour group supervision meeting , attend two -hours of weekly individual supervision by a licensed psychologist , and provide leadership in the coordination and smooth operation of the psychology service delivered by the NSU Psychology Team at BHMC. Accommodations include an assigned desk, storage space, computer with internet access, and a telephone. The interns' supervi sors are on-site and in an adjacent office so that access and support can occur seamlessly . When not on -site, the supervisor is readily available via phone to assist with more challenging situations. Prior to beginning the internship, Intern's will be sen t information about suggestions (e.g., various readings related to health psychology and an invitation to shadow outgoing Interns related to administrative duties ) and requirements (e.g., vita, background check, drug screening, proof of immunization, and pr oof of health insurance coverage). Intern Applicant Requirements: Previous health related experience is a necessity; this experience can be practicum, work, shadowing, or volunteer in nature . These experience s should be clearly noted in your appl ication cover letter/vita. Preference will be given to those in the health concentration or that have health/medical related coursework. Those seeking primarily psychiatric in -patient experiences or who are not highly motivated to work in a medical settin g should not apply. All interns will be required to complete a 10 Panel Drug Test and Level II Background Check prior to starting. All interns will also be required to have a Flu Vaccination, unless intern has a religious or medical exemption. In the eve nt of an exemption, the intern will be required to wear a mask during Flu Season while at the hospital. COVID -19 Updates: The Psychology Service at BHMC is following all CDC and DOH guidelines for healthcare workers including daily symptom screening, use of surgical masks , and social distancing. The use of eye protection is also used in patient facing areas. These modifications are subject to change based on then current CDC and DOH guidelines. REV. 12/20 PAGE 10 Broward Sheriff's Office (BSO ) - Timothy Ludwig, Ph.D. About Broward Sheriff's Office : The Broward Sheriff's Office Department of Detention operates the twelfth largest local jail system in the nation, with four facilities fully accredited by the American Correctional Association and the National Commission on Correctional Health Care. The average daily population exceeds 4500 inmates, of which approximately 32% are receiving some form of mental health services. One facility, the North Broward Detention Center, operates a 340 -bed Ment al Health Unit for inmates experiencing acute symptoms of their mental illness and who may require specialized housing and treatment services. The In -Custody Behavioral Services Division (ICBSD) is responsible for providing psychological services to the in mates housed on the Mental Health Unit. About the In -Custody Behavioral Services Division : Philosophy/Mission The Broward Sheriff's Office In -Custody Behavioral Service Division believes that all inmates should be treated as individuals and with dignity, respect, and understanding. As such, the ICBSD's mental health services focus on assessing the needs of the ind ividual based on their current level of functioning while seeking to maximize opportunities for success in the completion of their identified treatment goals. It is the mission of the In -Custody Behavioral Service Division to provide a safe and secure environment that will enable special needs inmates, who have emotional and behavioral difficulties and/or co -occurring disorders, an opportunity to successfully adjust within the correctional setting. In addition, these special needs inmates are afforded the supports and services necessary for recovery and successful community integration. Psychology Internship with BSO's ICBSD : Objectives and Philosophy The primary objective of BSO's Psychology Internship program is to provide an integrated, flexible, and diverse learning experience necessary for the emergence of a competent professional psychologist. The ICBSD provides a comprehensive learning experience in a multidisciplinary institutional setting emphasizing correctional and forensic work. Interns will have an opportunity to practice and enhance previously acquired skills, develop new skills, and develop competence in psychological assessment, interven tion, and consultation. In addition, interns will have an opportunity to conduct individual and group therapy, psycho - educational programs, and crisis -intervention. The interns will work with a broad range of disorders and challenging behavior managemen t issues. Outside of their clinical work, interns will have the opportunity to engage in curriculum development and program evaluation activities. Additionally, interns will have the opportunity to provide mental health education and training for Departmen t of Detention and Community Program staff. REV. 12/20 PAGE 11 Internship Training Environment Interns are expected to work a 40 -hour work week, Monday through Thursday from 8:00am to 4:30pm. There are no expectations for after -hours or on -call. Each intern is provided th eir own work station and computer at the North Broward Detention Center. The interns become a valued member of the treatment team which is comprised of three psychologists, three master's level clinicians, two bachelor level mental health specialists and t wo advanced practicum students. On Friday's the interns will be at NSU for weekly Professional Development (PD) seminars , Group Supervision, and/ or Supervision with a Post -Doctoral Student. Supervision and Training Each week the interns will receive two hours of individual supervision by a licensed psychologist, two hours of group supervision and training, and 15 to 20 hours of direct clinical service. Interns are also afforded the opportunity to supervise practicum students throughout their internship y ear. This opportunity provides them with the experience of supervising students with curriculum development, behavior management and treatment planning, and involves co -facilitation of mental health programming. Assessment Each intern will complete a min imum of 6 psychological assessments. These psychological assessments involve the administration of a full battery of tests, and typically include assessments of intelligence, personality, and malingering in order to help clarify diagnostic questions or to help guide treatment recommendations. Additional instruments may be incorporated into the battery based on the referral question. Treatment Each intern will maintain a minimum individual therapy caseload of 5 -10 clients. Given the transitory nature of the jail population, individual therapy may be provided on a brief or long -term basis. The internship provides exposure to a full spectrum of diagnoses, symptom presentations and severity, cultural backgrounds, and presenting problems. Interns will conduct ap proximately two groups per day and have the opportunity to co -facilitate groups with other treatment team members. Program Development Interns will participate in on -going curriculum development for daily group programs offered to the inmates housed on the mental health units. Typical curriculum topics include understanding mental illness, substance abuse, relapse prevention, criminal and addictive thinking, trauma, domestic violence, stress management, anger management, and additional topics of interest to the inmate population. Additionally, the interns are responsible for the operation of the Mental Health Unit's Transitional Program Unit. The mission of this special treatment milieu is to provide supportive and rehabilitative experiences that assist inmates in developing the behaviors and skills needed for transition from segregated housing to less restrictive housing alternatives. In dividuals who voluntarily participate in this program receive more intensive individual and group counseling focused on effective coping skills in the areas of socialization, communication, conflict resolution, REV. 12/20 PAGE 12 anger management, stress management, as well as any mental health or substance abuse issues they may have. Training During the course of the year, the i nterns will have the opportunity to assist in the development of continuing education training curriculum on various topics related to mental healt h and in presenting these training s to Department of Detention and Community Program's staff. Professional Development In accordance with South Florida Consortium Internship Program requirements, each intern will attend weekly professional development sem inars offered by Nova Southeastern University. Additionally, interns will further their knowledge on issues related to forensic and correctional psychology by reading books and articles provided by the training site supervisor. Seminars and monthly meeting s focusing on clinical, ethical, and forensic issues will also be provided to afford the intern an opportunity for networking and development of professional contacts. Research The value of research is recognized as an important professional developmental tool. Participation in research is encouraged at BSO and numerous opportunities and resources are available for interns interested in pursuing these interests. Leave Policy While interns are considered employees of Nova Southeastern University and follow the specified guidelines allotted to the university's employees, there is a pre -hiring clearance process that each prospective intern must successfully complete with the Browar d Sheriff's Office. This clearance/background process typically will be initiated in April or May to ensure the prospective intern may begin internship on September 1st. In accordance with Nova Southeastern University polic ies interns receive three weeks of vacation and a total of eleven days sick time. Holiday leave follows the holiday schedule of the training site. COVID -19 Updates The Department of Detention has implemented several preventative procedures as it relates to COVID -19.

REV. 12/20 PAGE 15 Child Provider Specialists - Nicole Cordero , Psy.D. Child Provider Specialists (CPS) offers comprehensive psychological and related services to children and adolescents in Miami -Dade, Broward, Palm Beach, and Collier Counties. While CPS's main office is in Weston, they have satellite offices across four counties, allowing them to provide convenie ntly-located services to as many families as possible. Although in its inception CPS was primarily a provider of psychological services, including testing and therapy, their belief has always been that an integrated approach is the best way to treat a chil d and his/her family. Consequently, CPS has developed close relationships over the years with specialists in related fields, such as neurology, developmental and behavioral pediatrics, behavior modification, speech - language therapy, occupational and physic al therapies, and educational interventions. Over time, CPS has joined forces with many of these specialists, who will come in as contractors to provide services within the Weston office. Furthermore, CPS has developed very strong relationships with many p rivate schools across four counties. Interns at CPS will enjoy a rich experience, working hand -in-hand with highly experienced psychologists to develop their skill base in neuropsychological assessment, consultation, parent and professional education, an d psychotherapeutic techniques (e.g., social skills groups and individual psychotherapy). CPS's strength lies in helping children with learning disorders, developmental delays, and/or social -emotional -behavioral challenges. Common diagnoses include everyth ing from Attention -Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and Specific Learning Disorders, to more severe challenges such as Autism Spectrum Disorders, Intellectual Disorders, Language Disorders, etc. Here is a list of the main opportunities/obligations whi le an intern at CPS: Interns will be expected to report to the main office in Weston, Monday through Thursday, unless otherwise specified. As an intern, the daily schedule will be from approximately 8:30am to 4:30pm; however, this is subject to change de pending on caseloads, the time of year, and what office the intern is working in. During CPS's \"peak season\" (i.e., when caseloads are heaviest), interns may be expected to work past 4:30pm on select days. This peak season typically occurs during the month s of January to July. Furthermore, interns must check with supervisors before taking vacation during busy months. Although Weston is the main location that interns will report to, they may also have the opportunity to report to different offices and schoo ls for testing and feedback sessions. These opportunities will help interns to build a network and reputation within the community. Testing, scoring, and report writing will be a large majority of an intern's workload. CPS works from a developmental super vision format: Interns will initially shadow Licensed Psychologists while they test. Interns will then slowly progress to administering some tests while supervised, to administering a full battery while supervised, to finally testing without a supervisor i n the room. Once interns are testing on their own, they will always report back to supervisors to review cases, score REV. 12/20 PAGE 16 assessments, plan for parent/school feedback meetings, and develop appropriate treatment plans and recommendations. Parent/school feedbac k sessions also follow a developmental supervision format: Interns will initially shadow supervisors, and eventually provide parent/school feedbacks sessions on their own. Interns may also assist senior psychologists in scoring assessments. This serves th e purpose of ensuring that senior psychologists will have help keeping up with heavy workloads, and more importantly, helps to familiarize interns with scoring various tests. Interns will also have the opportunity to work in homeschool and summer camp programs with children diagnosed with ADHD, Specific Learning Disorders, Autism (mild/level 1), behavioral challenges, etc. Interns may also provide individual and small group therapy, social skills training, behavioral treatment planning, and motivational coaching to homeschool students and summer campers. Computerized Cognitive Remediation: Interns may be trained in technology programs such as Cogmed Working Memory Training, Fast ForWord, C8 Sciences Activate, etc. This will help interns to better understan d why these programs are recommended and utilized for remedial purposes. They may also be trained to use these programs to track client progress, understand results, and interpret such results to parents and professionals involved in a child's care. Addit ionally, because CPS offers integrated services, interns will be exposed to and work in conjunction with prescriptive reading interventionists, occupational therapists, neurologists and pediatricians, speech -language pathologists, and other remedial/rehabi litative specialists. Psychology interns will work under the direct supervision of Nicole Cordero , Psy.D. In addition, there will also be opportunities for supervision provided by senior psychologists within the practice (Michael Rizzo, Ph.D. ) Sheri Silve rman, Psy.D. will also play a role in supervising interns from a School Psychology perspective. Lastly, our Post -Doctoral Resident will assist in supervisory relations and meetings. Support will be available at all times, in that CPS encourages a collegial team environment, with an \"open door\" policy, and at least one licensed professional available to interns and overseeing their work at all times. Supervision will occur almost daily. Interns are always expected to report back on their testing cases in o rder to determine what to do next and/or to prepare for feedback sessions/treatment planning. Interns will be provided with at least 6 to 8 hours of direct supervision per week; in both individual and group formats. It is anticipated that as the skills of the interns increase, they will be provided more flexibility to handle more complex cases and work closely with related professionals in an integrated team format.

NCSP Note: School District of Palm Beach County is taking a one -year hiatus during the 2021 -2022 training year and will not participate in the 2021 -2022 Match. The SDPBC is a well -established public educational institution that serves over 183,000 children, adolescents, and young adults. As a large urban school district, the SDPBC provides a broad range of services for children from 3 to 22 years of age. SDPBC covers a large geographical county area, which facilitates a rich cultural exchange of diverse communities with different socio - economic, ethnic, linguistic, and racial backgrounds. The School Psychological Services Program functions under the Exceptiona l Student Education Department but provides services to both regular and special education students and their families. The range of school psychological services includes: comprehensive psychological assessments, consultation, behavioral/academic assess ments and interventions, multi -tiered systems of support (MTSS) frameworks, teacher and parent training, mental health interventions (individual, group), crisis interventions for individuals and school -wide, student advocacy, home -school collaboration, strategies to assist special populations, training, and parent/family interventions. Interns will participate in the following training activities onsite : 1. Engage in many school -based multidisciplinary experiences such as school -based teams (MTSS Response t o Intervention), eligibility determination meetings, 504 meetings, manifestation determination hearings , one on one consultation with teachers and parents, and student advocacy. 2. Conduct comprehensive psycho -educational evaluations for high and low inciden ce disabilities, multicultural evaluations, developmental assessments, autism spectrum evaluations, emotional/behavioral evaluations, MT SS driven assessments, dyslexia - specific testing requests, gifted testing, 504 assessments and data analysis, and school neuropsychological evaluations. Assessments rely on a comprehensive and holistic framework. Interns will engage in test selection decisions to best respond to the presenting problem or evaluation question, administration of tests, scoring, data integrati on from multiple sources, report writing and interpretation of results to parents and school teams. 3. Develop and implement individual and group interventions, parent consultation, groups for specialized populations (anxiety, social skills deficits, anger m anagement, EBD students, acting out students, ELL at risk populations), and other psycho -educational and therapeutic interventions. 4. Lead and monitor the MTSS process. These responsibilities require advanced problem - solving facilitation, targeted -problem i dentification, generation of evidence -based REV. 12/20 PAGE 21 interventions, close progress monitoring of supplemental and intensive levels of intervention, and effective consultation skills. MTSS skills also include collection of RtI specific data collection, graphing dat a, rate of improvement applications, and data driven decision -making. 5. Conduct classroom observations, behavioral and academic monitoring, school advocacy, and consultation to ensure a positive school culture. 6. Participate with crisis team members. Training based on the \"PREPaRE\" model will be provided to interns as well as an expectation to participate on school crisis response teams. 7. Participate in professional decision -making committees such as Best Practices, Test Reviews, MTSS, and Crisis Intervention committees. 8. Conduct a presentation to school psychologists about a special clinical interest. 9. Pursue a special project that is clinically relevant to school psychology (e.g., program evaluation, N=1 outcome study, etc.). The project should be either quant itative or qualitative in nature. 10. Participate in professional training events. 11. Develop professional skills and confidence through a supervision style that provides a wide range of valuable experiences that allow for independent work and guided supervisio n. Interns will receive two hours per week of individual supervision with a lic ensed psychologist once a week, one hour of group supervision with a lic ensed psychologist once a week, and up to two additional hours per week of supplemental supervision with other on-site supervisor s as needed . Interns will also receive one hour/week of group supervision from the SFCIP's Director. Interns will review assessments (i.e., test selection, administration, scoring, integrati on of test data, recommendations, report writing, and communication with parents and teachers regarding test results), discuss consultation and professional dilemmas, and discuss intervention plans with his or her supervisor on a weekly basis. In addition , they will have opportunities to develop and implement academic, behavioral, and socio -emotional interventions, as well as evaluate programs and clinical outcomes. Furthermore, the vibrant and diverse student population will prepare interns with a rich fo undation of multicultural school psychology competence. REV. 12/20 PAGE 22 B. Supervision : The SFCIP seeks to develop strong mentoring relationships between SFCIP supervisors and interns, which will serve as one of the primary methods for achieving training goals and objectives. These relationships enhance the intern's personal and professional growth by fostering the development of competencies in scientific thinking, ethical decision making, and professional practice. All SFCIP interns receive at least four hours of face -to-face supervision, and are exposure to at least two licensed psychologis ts during the training year. Interns meet with at least one licensed psychologist at their sites for a total of three hours of supervision onsite, including two hours of individual supervision and an additional hour of either individual or group supervisio n, depending on the site. In addition, all SFCIP interns meet with the Director of Internship Training weekly for one hour of group supervision on Friday afternoons . All SFCIP interns also receive one hour of biweekly group sup ervision with a psychology post doctoral resident at NSU. Individual supervision is provided to SFCIP interns by licensed psychologists who take responsibility for the psychological services rendered by interns. Hence, individual supervision is focused on reviews of case assessment, conceptualization, treatment planning and interventions, client progress, recommendations, collaborations with other professionals in serving clients, supervision of intern supervision provided to practicum students or other staff, and general professional development issues. Supervision may also include live supervision, reviews of audio or video recordings , documentation reviews, intensive electronic reviews of de -identified psychological evaluations, and assigned readings. Supervisors provid e formative feedback based on their observations of interns' provision of direct services (e.g. intervention, assessment, or consultation) no less than qu arterly . Weekly group supervision with the SFCIP Director of Internship Training and focuses on case d iscussions, supervision of supervision provided to practicum students and others , enhancing self -reflection and self -care, negotiating conflict, and professional development , including postdoctoral training and licensure . The interns also utilize this time to discuss their experience of the program and their individual progress, and evaluate how successfully the program is addressing their needs. In addition, it provides interns access to the Director of Internship Training and additional time to interact w ith interns from other sites since groups are made up of interns from 3 -4 different sites. All SFCIP interns are also assigned to an NSU postdoctoral resident at the outset of the training year and meet with their assigned resident biweekly or more freque ntly if schedules permit. While postdoctoral residents are not licensed, they provide the interns with additional mentoring and exposure to alternative supervisory styles. All SFCIP supervisors follow a developmental approach to supervision and training. This approach is based on the philosophy that interns wi ll requir e more guidance and direction in the beginning of the internship year while progressing towards more professional autonomy as the year progresses . At the outset of the training year, the in tern meets with his/her supervisors and they collaboratively develop a personalized training plan, the SFCIP Intern Training Agreement (see Appendix E), based on the following: the intern's present level of competence, theoretical orientation, personality and background, and the sites' requirements/client populations. While the plan allows for individual customization of intern clinical experiences and supervision, it is structured around the SFCIP training aim and profession -wide competencies (see above) that all REV. 12/20 PAGE 23 SFCIP intern will be expected to meet by the end of internship year, providing the intern and supervisor with clear benchmarks for basing subs equent, quarterly intern performance evaluations. It also establishes the methods by which the SFCIP training goals and objectives will be met for the intern both at the consortium partner site and consortium wide, highlighting the importance of prioritizi ng attendance at all training activities and establishing clear expectations for interns and supervisors as partners in training. C. Weekly Seminars : All SFCIP interns are provided with at minimum two hours of formal instruction weekly to supplement their \"on-the-job\" experiential and supervision training experiences. In addition, these Consortium -wide seminars provide interns with an opportunity for weekly peer interaction. Intern attendance is mandatory at all weekly seminars . Each intern is responsibl e for signing the attendance sheet for these trainings as records of attendance/absence are kept on file. Interns may be excused from two seminars per quarter for illness or w ith advanced approval from the Director of Internship Training . If more than 2 training activities are missed in any quarter, the intern must make up the absence by one of the following means: (a) presenting an additional didactic to fellow interns or (b) providing proper documentation of attendance at an outside workshop relevant to professional psychology during the same quarter. If four (4) or more training activities within the same quarter are missed, the intern must present an additional didactic to make up for the excessive absence and the intern's poor attendance will be reflected on that quarter's performance evaluation. No more than eight (8) missed training activities per year will be acceptable unless under very serious circumstances. Please note that making up missed didactics by a ttending outside presentations is considered to make up for missed learning, but does not excuse interns from the maximum absences listed above. Interns spend at minimum 2-3 hours per week in one of three types of weekly seminar training activities that a ll SFCIP interns are required to participate in (see Appendix A for schedule) : 1. Professional Development S eminars : Interns attend a series of formal three -hour didactic seminars at Nova Southeastern University (NSU) conducted by College of Psychology (COP ) faculty, SFCIP partner site supervisors, community clinical psychologists, psychiatrists, or other guest presenters. The Professional Development series covers broad areas including: ethics and professional behavior, assessment approaches, psychopathology and treatment interventions for adults and youth, cultural & individual differences, psychopharmacology, and professional development. The Professional Develo pment seminar series is scheduled in collaboration with the NSU COP Continuing Education program, broadening the score of presenters to include nationally and internationally know n professionals who will expose all SFCIP interns to a broad base of knowledg e and skills. 2. Grand Rounds : Each consortium partner site and the NSU clinics host all the SFCIP interns once a year for a two -hour presentations including didactic and case discussions. Didactic material and cases presented are usually representative of the theoretical models, assessment and intervention approaches, and clients served at the host site. Thus, REV. 12/20 PAGE 24 attending grand rounds exposes all SFCIP interns to a broad base of knowledge and skills. 3. Intern Presentations: Each SFCIP intern facilitates at l east one didactic presentation per year on a topic of clinical interest developed from reviews of the research literature. Interns provide the presentation title, learning objectives, and at minimum 2 peer - reviewed journal articles referen ced in the presen tation to the Director of Internship Training prior to presenting . In keeping with the SFCIP's \"practitioner informed by science\" model of training, interns are required to incorporate discussion of the empirical support for the clinical information presented. Interns typically cover a range of clinical topics including assessments, theoretical models/approaches, and child and adult psychopathology and interventions; thus, exposing fellow interns to a broad base of knowledge and skills. Interns are provided with feedback about their presentation skills and ability to critically discuss the literature supporting their presentation using the Intern Presentation Ratings form (see Appendix F ) and a summary of their fellow intern's ratings of t heir presentation using the Professional Development E valuation Survey (see Appendix G ). These ratings are also shared with the intern's site supervisors. Intern feedback is crucial to ensuring the quality of SFCIP training activities. Interns are asked to complete Professional Development Evaluation Survey (see Appendix G ) forms after each Professional and intern didactic presentation . This information is used to make improvements to training activities yearly. For instance, intern feedback about the qual ity of presentations is taken into account when considering which presenters to invite back for the next training years' Professional Development seminars. It is also used to provide formative feedback to fellow interns regarding their professional present ation skills as detailed in the section above . At mid - year and again at the end of the training year, interns are asked to provide feedback about the training program (see Appendix H ) and supervisor performance (see Appendix I ). The Director of Internship Training summarizes this information as group data and presents it to the site supervisors during quarterly meetings. Care is taken to protect the anonymity of the interns providing the feedback. The aim of sharing this information with site supervisors is twofold: first, to increase awareness of program strengths and areas in need of improvement and second, to inform the development of plans to improve the quality of the training program. PERFORMANCE EVALUATIONS Site supervisors are responsible for providing interns with quarterly written feedback using the Intern Performance Evaluation (see Appendix J) regarding their progress toward achieving all competencies . Following a developmental model, a ll ratings are made rel ative to the level of performance expected given the point of the year at which the evaluation is conducted. Specifically, it is expected that at the three month evaluation , most interns demonstrate minimal to basic knowledge, skills, and abilities (corres ponding to ratings of 1- minimal knowledge, skills, and abilities or 2 - basic knowledge, skills, and abilities ). As the year progresses, interns' knowledge, skills, and abilities are expected to increase, so that by the end of the training year, they are expected to demonstrate intermediate to advanced levels of performance (co rresponding to ratings of 3 - intermediate knowledge, skills, and abilities or 4 - advanced knowledge, skills, and abilities ). REV. 12/20 PAGE 25 At the six month evaluation, each intern must receive a rating of \"2 - basic knowledge, skills, and abilities \" or higher (e.g., 3 - intermediate knowledge, skills, and abilities or 4 - advanced knowledge, skills, and abilities ) in all competency areas . Any rating of \" 1- minimal knowledge, skills, and abiliti es\" will require the generation of a performance improvement plan to assist the intern in improving the particular issue. The standards are raised as the intern progresses toward completion of the internship year . At the nine -month evaluation, each intern must receive a rating of \" 3 - intermediate knowledge, skills\" and abilities \" or \"4 - advanced knowledge, skills, and ab ilities \". Any rating of \"2 - basic knowledge, skills, and abilities \" or \"1- minimal knowledge, skills, and abilities \" will be addressed via a performance improvement plan . At 12 months, during the final evaluation, each intern is required to receive minim um ratings of \"3 - intermediate knowledge, skills\" and abilities \" or higher (i.e., \"4 - advanced knowledge, skills, and abilities \") in all areas assessed in order to successfully complete the training program. At the end of the training year, all interns w ho display competency in all areas will be deemed as attaining the program's aim of readiness for entry level independent practice and licensure as a Health Service Psychologist . RECORD RETENTION POLICIES Intern training records are stored in locked file cabinets. The records for the more recent training years are stored within the internship D irector of Training 's office. Older records are stored within locked file cabinets within locked COP file rooms. In the event of a formal complaint, these would be maintained within the intern's file. Access to all training records is limited to the internship D irector of Training and their graduate assistants for filing. REV. 12/20 PAGE 26 DUE PROCESS AND GRIEVANCE PROCEDURES It is the policy of the South Florida Consortium Internship Program (SFCIP) that interns are assured due process regarding concerns which might arise over their performance and functioning. The policy is guided by principles to ensure that interns receive ongoing constructive feedback about their performance, opportunities and support for remediation if needed, and advisement of intern rights and responsibilities and processes to address concerns or grievances. This policy is enacted with respect for intern diversity in areas of professional functioning; therefore, SFCIP supervisors are expected to adapt the supervisory style, focus, and expectations for each intern based on the intern's professional developmental level, theoretical orientation, personality and cultural backgro und. The SFCIP Inter n Training Agreement (Appendix E), developed with the interns at the outset of training, should establish individually customized training plan for the intern, as well as training objectives and methods within the specified SFCIP traini ng goal areas forming the basis for evaluation of the intern's performance. Since the SFCIP accepts only NSU COP doctoral students as interns, all student grievance and due process policies outlined in the relevant College of Psychology Doctor al Program Handbook s may also apply. Intern Performance Interns are evaluated and provided with both formative and summative feedback on an ongoing basis through weekly individual supervision and formal quarterly intern performance evaluations (see Appendix J). If at any time there are deficiencies in an intern's performance or professionalism, the intern's site supervisor will provide constructive verbal feedback to the intern and document in writing any discussions related to the problem area(s). While it is difficult to operationally define all characteristics associated with quality professionalism, broad areas include: (a) adherence to the APA Ethical Code of Conduct for Psychologists, institution policies and procedures, and applicable state of Flor ida laws, clinical competence (as defined above under performance evaluations); (b) professional comportment, including: dependability; accepting responsibility for own work; professional grooming, attire, and demeanor; and demonstrating maturity, discret ion, sound professional judgment and a respectful/non -hostil e attitude, and developing self-assessment skills; and (c) a positive attitude toward others, including: cooperating and respecting others, giving, accepting, and utilizing constructive feedback, and developing and maintaining positive working relationships with peers, supervisors, and others. Step 1: If the intern continues to struggle with the problem areas , and/or the intern's performance competencies are rated below satisfactory levels durin g quarterly evaluations, a performance improvement plan will be developed using the NSU Performanc e Planning Worksheet ( Appendix K) to remediate any deficient areas. The performance improvement plan must be signed by the intern and primary supervisor, and a copy forwarded to the Internship Director of Training. The Performance improvement plan w ill focus on improving minimum competencies and/or professionalism within a clearly defined timeframe. Remediation strategies REV. 12/20 PAGE 27 may include increased supervision, additional readings, increased opportunities to practice, additional coursework, etc. Step 2: If the site supervisor and intern cannot reach an agreement about the performance improvement plan, the Director of Internship Training would mediate the situation. Step 3: If the Director of Internship Training was unable to resolve the situation, consultation would be requested from the COP doctoral programs Director of Clinical Training to aid with the resolution of the problem, and development of performance improvement plan. Decisions regarding problem resolution are individual and specific to the facts related to each intern. Step 4: If minimum competencies are not attained within the established timeframe of the performance improvement plan, disciplinary action (including dismissal from the internship program) in keeping with rules and regulations covering disciplinary actions outlin ed by NSU's Office of Human Resources may be warranted. NSU's Office of Human Resources will be consulted via the COP representative for approval prior to administering disciplinary action beyond a verbal warning. The Director of Internship Training (DIT) investigates any behaviors that may warrant disciplinary action and is consulted prior to the recommendation of any disciplinary action. An intern may be terminated from their site due to violations of ethics, law, and/or agency policy, but they remain SFCIP interns until the matter is reviewed by the DIT and/or SFCIP Executive Board (EB). The intern would meet with the DIT and/or members of the SFCIP Executive Board , and a representative from the university community of his/her choosing if desired. The Director of Internship Training would present the results of the investigation and make a recommendation to the Dean of the COP and a decision would be made regarding any further action , which may include termination from the internship program . The Dir ector of Clinical Training for the COP doctoral programs would be kept apprised of the progress. The SFCIP site supervisor(s) would be informed about any decisions or actions taken by the university. The intern could appeal any disciplinary action affectin g employment to the NSU Office of Human Resources or to the Dean of COP for disciplinary actions affecting academic standing. Appeals Interns wishing to contest disciplinary decisions with the NSU Office of Human Resources must follow NSU's Formal Grieva nce Hearing Policy: http://www.nova.edu/cwis/hrd/emphanbk/hearing.html . Interns who wish to contest disciplinary decisions affecting academic standing must submit a written appeal with th e Dean of COP within 30 working days of the decision. Additional steps to be taken by the Dean are outlined in the COP Doctoral Handbook. REV. 12/20 PAGE 28 Intern Grievances The COP , SFCIP Executive Board, and supervisors value professionalism, honesty, and ethical conduct in the handling of intern concerns. At all times, matters are handled in the spirit of education and development. The purpose of the intern grievance and appeals process is to allow for the orderly resolution of intern grievances. At all ti mes, the respect and protection of interns is of utmost concern. In keeping wi th the policy of NSU's Office of Human Resources, interns who file a grievance will not be retaliated against through any adverse action by their supervisor or any NSU representa tive. If an intern has a grievance about his/her training, the following steps should be taken: Step 1: The intern should work with his/her supervisor to resolve the issue. Step 2: If a resolution is not achieved, the intern should advise the Director of Internship Training , who would attempt to mediate or resolve the concern. Should the issue involve the Director of Internship Training , the intern would advise the SFCIP Chief Psychologist who would attempt to mediate or resolve the situation. Step 3: If the intern believes that the informal process above is unsuccessful in resolving the issue, the intern may file a written grievance with the Director of Internship Training (or Chief Psychologist, if grievance involves the Director of Internship Training ), including a concise statement of the particular manner of harm, along with all relevant facts and compelling supporting evidence. a) The Director of Internship Training (or Chief Psychologist, if grievance involves the Director of Internship Training ) will review the written document to determine if the complaint warrants further review. If the no further review is warranted, the formal grievance will be terminated and the intern will be provided with a brief written explanation. If further review is warr anted, the grievance will be forwarded to the SFCIP Executive Board (EB). b) The EB will conduct a substantive review of all facts it deems pertinent to the grievance and, at its discretion, may interview the intern or any other pertinent person that it judges has the information relevant to the review. c) The EB will file a written recommendation, with justification, to the Dean of the COP . Recommendations of the EB will also be forwarded to the appropriate site supervisor(s)/administrator(s) for review and response. The decision of the EB is final. It is the responsibility of th e Director of Internship Training to follow -up on the response to these recommendations by ensuring that site supervisors or others implicated in the intern grievance submit responses to the EB and that all EB decisions are implemented by the training site s or the program.

REV. 12/20 PAGE 46 Appendix D PROGRAM EVALUATION Curriculum Description: This three -part training activity involves: 1) assessment of Intern knowledge of Program Evaluation both prior to (pre-test) and following (post -test) didactic instruction, 2) Two didactic training sessions focused on theories and methods of Program Evaluation, and 3) a Logic Model group activity carried by the interns. In terns will gain knowledge of theories and methods of Program Evaluation during two didactic sessions. After the first didactic, they will collaborate with their site supervisors on carrying out a program evaluation, applying the Logic Model method. During the second didactic, interns' group project will be reviewed and they will be trained on delivering program evaluation feedback to stakeholders. Over the summer, interns will present results and supervisor overseeing project will complete the Interns' Prog ram Evaluation Project Observation Form. Rationale: It is important that Psychology interns understand and are able to apply Program Evaluation theories and methods in their future work as Psychologists. Given that psychologists should demonstrate clear e vidence of effectiveness in achieving desired goals, conducting formal program evaluations is one way to be rigorous in this endeavor. This three -part training activity will expose interns to various theories and methods of program evaluation and gauge learning with pre -and post -tests. In addition, interns will have the opportunity to apply these new skills through a small -group program evaluation project using a Logic Model. Learning Objectives and Outcomes: Interns will demonstrate intermediate to advanc ed levels of competency in program evaluation knowledge and skills. Interns who successfully complete this training will be able to: 1) Demonstrate knowledge of the theories and methods of Program Evaluation. 2) Demonstrate the ability to develop a logic model t hat is relevant to their current work. 3) List 1 -2 ways in which a logic model may be helpful. Activities: Interns will complete the Program Evaluation Pre -test Interns will attend two Program Evaluation didactic presentations Interns will complete the Progr am Evaluation Post -test. Interns will plan and execute a small -group program evaluation, using a Logic Model. Interns will provide feedback to stakeholders about the outcome of their program evaluation group project. Interns' performance will be evaluated by supervisor suing the Interns' Program Evaluation Project Observation Form. Outcome Measures: Pre and Post tests Evaluation of Intern competencies in program evaluation using the Program Evaluation Knowledge and Skills Rating Form Evaluation by the Intern's supervisors of Intern competencies in program evaluation using the Intern Quarterly Evaluation based on feedba ck from the Program Evaluation Knowledge and Skills Rating Form as well as any other available evidence from site -based program evaluation activities (e.g., Interns' Program Evaluation Project Observation Form).
