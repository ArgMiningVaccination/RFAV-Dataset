Whether it was being immune to a certain virus wreaking havoc across the globe or how to support your immune system in battling said virus, one thing is for sure, talking about immunity is going anywhere. Doctors often focus on ways to support your immune system. Diet, exercise, and supplements are often at the top of the list, but one often undermentioned component is relaxation. Stress is a nasty side effect of the modern world, we're constantly under pressure whether it's at our job to get our work done, the chaos that follows a home life with children, or one of the other million things that cause us to feel stress. Stress produces a hormone called Cortisol. Cortisol was vital to the survival of our ancestors as they were hunting wild animals and living in the open wilderness. It can help athletes make those crucial plays in sports and it certainly proves beneficial if we are truly in a life or death situation. However, a constant flow of Cortisol, as induced by stress, is very detrimental to our health. It raises our blood pressure and glucose, taxes our muscles and mind, and causes a myriad of problems that can have major impacts on ourselves and others. Simply put, when you're stressed your body's immune system is taxed by internal problems and can't effectively fight off outside threats like viruses and illness. The only cure for stress is stress management and that starts with relaxation. Putting yourself into a relaxing environment allows your body to reset and turn off that Cortisol production. Your body will begin repairing and your immune system will get back to work kicking butt! Despite what you might think, a lot of people don't know how to relax. If you're one of these people, we're here to help. We highly recommend our floatation services for the best possible relaxation. Taking the stress off your muscles, joint and ligaments send the signals to your body to stop that cortisol production and to begin healing. The added benefit is that floatation chambers are similar to sensory deprivation. You can tune out the outside noise and bring your mind to peace, which is arguably the most important action you can take in achieving true relaxation. Our salt room also allows for a calm environment while refreshing and rejuvenating your respiratory system. Ionized salt calms inflamed lungs and helps with oxygen saturation, ultimately supporting a stronger immune system. If you're looking for something quick and easy, our foot soaks, complimented with an Adako foot massage and WYSIWYG Juice, are perfect for a lunch break or anyone on a schedule.
