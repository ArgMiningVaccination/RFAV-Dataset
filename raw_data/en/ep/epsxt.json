It was in Oregon, where she first discovered naturopathic medicine and holistic health care. She was introduced to herbal medicine and homeopathy, which showed her the body's amazing ability to heal itself without pharmaceuticals. This piqued her interest in natural medicine and started her journey towards becoming a physician. Dr. Mastrich earned her Bachelors of Science in Sports Medicine & Biomedical Science from Colorado State University in Fort Collins, Colorado. Afterwards, she returned to Oregon to obtain her Naturopathic Medical Degree from the National College of Natural Medicine (NCNM) in Portland, Oregon. While attending NCNM, her passion for nutrition and botanical medicine allowed her to develop into a practitioner who strives to find the cause of the body's suffering and develop strategies to bring the body back to a state of balance. Prior to becoming a Naturopathic Physician, she had spent years as a Nursing Assistant and Emergency Room Technician, fostering compassion, patience, and honing communication skills to help relate to patients and their specific health needs. Dr. Ariel loves working with pediatrics, which includes comprehensive age-appropriate well child physicals, sports exams, in addition to individualized vaccine counseling with families, lifestyle counseling and dietary support. Besides monitoring your child's growth and development, she can handle acute and chronic conditions, such as allergies, asthma, eczema, constipation, chronic abdominal pain, diarrhea, fatigue, behavioral issues, ear infections, fever, upper respiratory infections, etc. She is taking patients as young as 4-weeks old for primary naturopathic care. She enjoys using IV therapy, botanical medicine, homeopathy, and nutritional counseling, as well as lifestyle counseling modalities, to help shape a path of wellness for her patients. She believes that prevention is the best form of medicine, and she will work hard to keep chronic diseases at bay. Whether you suffer from a chronic condition, an acute illness or would like to obtain wellness and prevent disease down the road, Dr. Mastrich can help you achieve your health goals.
