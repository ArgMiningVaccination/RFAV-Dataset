As a parent, there's much you can do to make sure that your child's response is a positive one. Consider the following tips to help your child succeed at school. Help make homework a habit. Set aside ample time for tackling homework, and create a permanent study spot\u2014either in your child's bedroom or another part of your home\u2014that allows your child to concentrate. Be sure that the TV stays off during homework time.Also be available to answer questions and provide guidance\u2014but never do your child's homework. Boost brainpower with breakfast. Regular breakfast-skipping is tied to lower school performance. Breakfast helps provide fuel to learn. Make sleep a priority. Kids who are chronically sleep-deprived are more likely to have problems learning and paying attention and are at higher risk of being overweight than their more rested classmates. School-age children generally need at least nine hours of shut-eye every night.Be a positive force. Express interest and excitement about the school year. Encourage initiative and curiosity. Praise your child when he or she participates in school activities and tries new things. Attend school functions, and stay involved in your child's education. Your positive attitude is likely to be contagious.Parents: Make the grade What you can do to help your child succeed in school set aside ample time for tackling homework, and create a permanent study spot.Ch i l d r e n 's he a l t h tillamook county's multimodular pre-school exams are a community program led by tillamook Hospital in partnership with the Northwest Regional Education service district, tillamook county schools, Head start, tillamook county Health department and tillamook county Board of commissioners, along with a number of other community organizations, businesses and individuals who believe that early detection of learning barriers is a major key to success in learning at school.Despite the fact that too many children in this country are overweight, many parents still worry that their kids aren't getting enough to eat. To make sure that your child is getting enough\u2014but not too much\u2014to eat, follow these suggestions from the American Academy of Pediatrics: Plan three healthful meals and two nutritious snacks every day. Make sure no one food group is left out for more than a few days. Little tykes need the balance of nutrients that comes from eating all types of food. The five main food groups are: grains, such as rice and whole-grain breads and cereals; veggies of any kind, including vegetable juices; fruits of any kind, including 100 percent fruit juice; proteins, such as meats, poultry, nuts, eggs, fish and beans; and dairy products, such as milk, yogurt and cheese. Kids need about 2 cups of nonfat or low-fat milk a day to meet bone-building calcium needs. According to experts, if your child is growing normally, has energy and seems healthy, he or she is probably getting enough to eat. But check with your doctor if you have doubts.

Her visit revealed she had ovarian cancer. She was quickly scheduled for surgery and began follow-up cancer treatment with Gerald Gibbs, MD, and the nursing staff at Tillamook County General Hospital's Outpatient Therapy Services (OTS). Nine months later, she completed her treatments and is looking forward to the next chapter of her life. Called \"the silent killer,\" ovarian cancer has no obvious signs or symptoms that tell a woman that she may have it. A blood test, a Pap smear or a physical exam are the only ways to detect it, which makes regular checkups Surviving cancer sally's story with a health care provider important, even when there are no immediate concerns. \"There's no word to express how wonderful and caring Dr. Gibbs and the OTS staff are, \" says Wallace. \"They look after me with loving care, taking care of the simplest little things, like making sure I have the right-sized chair, having flowers in my room, bringing me coffee. And Dr. Gibbs takes the time to explain all my test results and answer my questions. \" One resource that helped Wallace as she dealt with the loss of her hair during chemotherapy was the \"Look Good . . . Feel Better\" program offered by the American Cancer Society. The program offers women cosmetic help and a closet full of wigs to choose from. Wallace found losing her hair during chemotherapy hard to deal with. \"What I missed most were my eyebrows and eyelashes,\" she says. She looked in the phone book, but she could find no information about obtaining a wig until she found a \"Look Good . . . Feel Better\" flyer at her doctor's office. She scheduled an appointment with local beautician Robyn Mallory. \"How do you say you've h a d c an c e r an d b e e n blessed?\" Wallace asks. She finds blessing in knowing that her cancer was diagnosed relatively early, in the loving care she received during her treatment, and through the support of family and friends she received along her treatment journey.

But there are some important things you ought to know about it, including: Of all gynecological cancers, it is the deadliest. What makes ovarian cancer so often incurable?One reason is that ovarian tumors can be hard to find during an examination, notes the American Cancer Society (ACS). Another reason is that the symptoms of ovarian cancer may not necessarily ring any serious alarms with women. They might think they're having stomach problems, for instance. But research has taken a zoom lens to this disease, narrowing the information women need to focus on. And ongoing clinical trials may provide more help. CoMMon early sy MPtoMs Ovarian cancer is most easily treated when it's discovered early. According to the ACS, research has identified specific symptoms common in women diagnosed with it: Pelvic or abdominal pain. Abdominal bloating. Urinary urgency. Urinary frequency. Trouble eating or feeling full quickly. Almost everyone occasionally has one or more of these symptoms. What is important, however, is if any of the symptoms you have are new, persistent and frequent\u2014noticeably different than how you usually feel. If so, that's a signal to take your concerns to your doctor as soon as possible, advises the ACS. Again, treatment is most effective when ovarian cancer is found early. The ACS estimates that more than 90 percent of women whose cancer is found when it is still confined to the ovaries are alive five years later. the next ste P Unfortunately, there is no single, reliable way to test for ovarian cancer. Still, your doctor can do a full physical exam. He or she might want you to undergo an ultrasound of your pelvis as well as a CT scan. You might also have blood tests or other tests.

Major sources are IV drug use and male homosexual contact. In the past, the primary source of the disease was contaminated blood transfusions, but today blood donations are carefully screened, making transfusions an unlikely source of infection. Today, fewer than 1 in 2. million units are contaminated with the virus. Hepatitis C is similar to HIV in that it uses RNA to duplicate itself inside its chosen host cell\u2014the liver hepatocyte. It undergoes multiple mutations, making treatment di cult. Aft er exposure, approximately 10 to 1 percent of people will develop spontaneous immunity. Treatment consists of using two or three medications for 2 to weeks to enhance the body's ability to develop immunity to the virus. Clearing of the virus hePatitis siMPliFied Here's what you need to know to protect yourself from the disease It's Easy to get lost in the ABCs of hepatitis. Not to mention the D's and E's. But when it comes to fi guring out this alphabet soup of viruses, keep one thing in mind: It's all about the liver. Each type of hepatitis aff ects and can harm the liver. In fact, the word hepatitis actually means infl ammation of the liver. Th is infl ammation can result from a variety of causes, including drug and alcohol use and infection with a hepatitis virus, reports the American Gastroenterological Association. Hepatitis is potentially dangerous because it can prevent the liver from doing its vital jobs of changing food into energy and fi ltering toxins from the body, explains the National Institutes of Health (NIH).Th at's why it's important to know how hepatitis, in all its various forms, spreads\u2014so that you can help protect your health. stay saFe Here's a look at risk factors for the diff erent types of hepatitis: Hepatitis A and E are oft en spread through food or water contaminated by the feces of infected people. People at risk include those traveling to developing countries, those who live or have sex with infected people, and people who live in areas where there are outbreaks of the diseases.Hepatitis B, C and D are spread through contact with infected blood and during sex and childbirth. Th ose at risk include health care workers, people with multiple sex partners, injection drug users and babies born to infected mothers. Tattoos and body piercings can also pose a risk. With those risks in mind, you can stay safe by: Getting shots. Vaccines can help prevent hepatitis A and B. Th e Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends hepatitis B shots for all infants, children and adolescents and for any unvaccinated adults who may be at risk. A hepatitis A shot is recommended for all children at 1 year old and anyone else at risk for infection. Washing your hands before preparing or eating food and aft er using the bathroom. Not sharing razor blades, toothbrushes, nail clippers or drug needles. Avoiding tap water in developing countries. Using latex condoms. get helP According to the NIH, symptoms of hepa- titis may include: Jaundice, which causes yellowing of the skin and eyes. Abdominal pain. Diarrhea, nausea or vomiting. Low-grade fever. Headache. Fatigue. If you notice any of these signs and suspect hepatitis, call your doctor. A physician can do blood tests to confi rm hepatitis and, if necessary, prescribe medications to help treat the condition.and persistent immunity is called sustained viral response and occurs in 0 to 0 percent of patients using currently approved treatments. Treatments are expensive\u2014from 1,000 to 0,000\u2014and difficult for patients. They can cause fever, chills, depression, anemia and diabetes. A popular natural remedy tried by patients with hepatitis C is the use of milk thistle. Th e properties of milk thistle are being tested for clinical e cacy, but natural remedies have thus far proved ineffective and even fatal.Rob Soans receives OHSU Rural Service Award Rob soans, Pa-c, of tillamook Medical Group, is the recipient of this year's Karen whitaker Knapp service award. the award is presented annually by the faculty of the oregon Health & science University (oHsU) Physician assistant Education Program in recognition of physician assistants whose clinical careers refl ect a commitment to the rural and medically underserved of oregon. a graduate of oHsU's inaugural physician assistant class in 1997 and nationally certifi ed, soans began providing primary care services at the Rinehart clinic in wheeler.

Keep a notebook to write down questions for the ICU staff and information you want to relay to friends and relatives. Also, try not to worry about all the tubes, lines, monitors and alarms you may see. Th e nurses can explain these devices too. think safety. Check with the nurses about what steps to follow for your loved one's protection. For example, it's best to postpone your visit if you're feeling sick. ask what to bring. Unfortunately, flowers and plants can carry infectious germs. But it's often OK to bring your loved one comforting items such as photos or cards. talk to your loved one. Sedating medicines and other factors can make ICU patients less alert than usual. But even if your loved one doesn't respond to your voice or touch, he or she may still know that you're there. Your voice and touch can be comforting. If your loved one is alert but has a breathing tube, try phrasing questions that can be answered with a nod or shake of the head. take care of yourself. While you want to be there emotionally and physically for your loved one, you also need to rest and eat well during this stressful time.
