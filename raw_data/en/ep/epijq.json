It is my pleasure to take this opportunity to highlight some of the activities and events that have taken place during the past year. The most important part of the department is its people and on that front we have added to our faculty family several new members including: Malcolm Low from the University of Oregon as Professor; Scott Pletcher from Baylor College of Medicine as Associate Profes- sor; Yatrik Shah from the National Cancer Institute as Assistant Pro- fessor; Lei Yin from the University of Pennsylvania as Assistant Pro- fessor; Nancy Linford from Baylor College of Medicine as a Research Investigator; and Xin (Tony) Tong from the University of Pennsylva- nia as a Research Investigator. We are also actively recruiting in the areas of reproductive sciences, cardiovascular physiology and systems biology. In addition, joint appointments were extended to Justus Anumonwo (Assistant Professor, Internal Medicine/Cardiology), Peter Arvan (Professor, Internal Medicine/Metabolism, Endocrinology & Diabetes), Lori Isom (Professor, Pharmacology) and Chung Owyang (Professor, Internal Medicine/Gastroenterology). More information pertaining to our new faculty members is provided in this Newsletter. Collectively, this brings us to a total of 27 primary faculty, 35 joint faculty, 7 adjunct and 8 active and inactive emeritus faculty members, and 5 research faculty. The depth and breadth of the expertise of our faculty place us among the elite institutions in terms of what we are able to offer to our students and trainees. Several highlights pertaining to the University of Michigan deserve mention, which directly or indirectly have a positive impact on our department. First, is the acquisition of the former Pfizer facility located at Huron Parkway and Plymouth Road. This was formalized in June 2009 and includes a 30 -building complex that will add nearly 1 million square foot of research space. The potential of having this new space is transformative and the medical school, which is a major investor and beneficiary of this purchase, is involved in discussion and planning to define the groups and areas of focus that will be moving to what is now called the North Campus Research Complex (NCRC). Second, is the manner by which the University of Michigan has been able to overcome the current economic climate because of its planning and fiscal management of its endowment and the clinical operations of the health care system. These excellent economic policies have made it feasible for us to continue to excel in our educational mission and to grow in a strategic manner. Third, the University of Michigan Medical School moved from an 11th national ranking in total NIH dollars in 2007 to 7th in 2008 (measured from Oct through Sept), which is the highest ranking the School has received. During 2008, our physiology department ranked 10th nationally in NIH dollars, and we are even more excited because we anticipate that this ranking will improve to single digits during 2009, since our grant funding increased from 10.6 million dollars in 2008 to 13.6 million dollars in 2009. Highlights of the 2008 -2009 academic year include the John Faulk- ner Day event (please see more details on page 2) and the naming of John A. Williams as the first recipient of the Horace W. Davenport endowed collegiate professorship in physiology (ceremony planned for February 1, 2010). We are also embarking on an effort to establish the John A. Williams Collegiate Professorship of Gastrointestinal Physiol- ogy to honor John's contributions and service to our department and the field (please see the back of this Newsletter for our fund -raising efforts). John remains a very active and essential member of our de- partment and he continues to hold two NIH grants (including a prestig- ious NIH Merit \"R37\" Award) and oversees our Systems and Integra- tive Biology Training Grant. Of course, my faculty colleagues would scold me if I did not mention as another highlight that this years' stu- dent-faculty annual softball game was won by the faculty with a score of 11 -3 and I am not sure if this margin can ever be duplicated. To our alumni and former co -workers, I hope you will stay in touch and visit us or visit our website at www.physiology.med.umich.edu . It is an honor and a privilege for me to be part of the Physiology Department at the University of Michigan.

This event was called \"John Faulkner Day\" and was attended by 130 \"fans\" that included faculty, staff, students, John's wife Margaret and his daughter Melanie (John and Margaret's second daughter, Megan, was unable to attend because of scheduling issues that were beyond her con- trol). Other invited guests included President Mary Sue Coleman, Dean James Woolliscroft, Coach Lloyd Carr, Gary Sieck (American Physiological Society President), Martin Frank (American Physiologi- al Society Executive Director), and Doug Noll (Chair of Biomedical Engineering). Dr. Faulkner was presented with a Lifetime Service Award, by University President Mary Sue Coleman, as the longest - serving active faculty member of the Medical School. John Faulkner joined the faculty of the University of Michigan in 1960 and moved to the Physiology Department as an Associate Professor in 1966. Dr. Faulkner has also been a member of the American Physiological Soci- ety (APS) for over 41 years. Gary Sieck and Martin Frank read a proc- lamation issued by the APS acknowledging Faulkner's extensive and important contributions to research, teaching, and mentoring in the field of Physiology. John was presented with a commemorative plaque engraved with the APS proclamation. Remarks were also given by Dean Woolliscroft, then by Bishr Omary and finally John Williams (current and past chairs of our department), and by former U -M foot- ball coach Lloyd Carr who presented John with a signed U -M football helmet. The event also included a musical tribute led by faculty mem- bers James Ashton -Miller and Mark Palmer that included audience participation. The audience participation involved singing: \"He's a - biking up Geddes to the U / His oldest sarcomeres to renew / Titin, Z - bands and myosin, too / John's the best o'Maize & Blue!\". The high- light for the attendees was a presentation by Dr. Faulkner describing the unlikely path that brought him to the University of Michigan over 50 years ago and how he has sustained a 49 -year career at Michigan. It was a wonderful opportunity to let John know how much the Uni- versity, the Medical School, the Department of Molecular & Integra- tive Physiology, John's Colleagues and co -workers (and even the U -M football team) appreciated his contributions and how many lives he touched over the years.

Davenport Collegiate Professor of Physiology Faculty Awards & Honors 2008 -2009 3 Physiology Faculty: I made it through my first year as graduate direc- tor with the help of a terrific committee and lots of support from the coordinator, Michele Boggs. Of note, in the past academic year, eight students obtained their doctorates, seven passed their pre- liminary exams to candidacy, and six students joined Molecular & Integrative Physiology from either the Program in Biomedical Sciences or Medical Science Train- ing Program. You can find out more about the exciting work, accom- plishments and research interests of our students by visiting the grad- uate program webpage: http://sitemaker.umich.edu/physgrad/home . As we enter into the winter recruiting season, I would like to remind you that some of our greatest recruiters have been our \"friends\" of Physiology - particularly our alumni, former faculty, and former postdoctoral fellows. Each year several of our top applicants from across the country have crossed paths with one of you, and that influ- enced them to apply and/or join our program. So thank you, and please keep encouraging your best and brightest to consider the Phys- iology Graduate Program for their graduate studies. We recently had a number of events to welcome our new stu- dents and celebrate the tremendous accomplishments of our existing graduate students. During our Fall Welcome , we introduced to the department the incoming PIBS students with an interest in Molecular & Integrative Physiology. We also presented the John A. Williams Service Award to Nathan Palpant, the Arthur J. Vander Teaching Award to Jon Mowers, and the John Bean Award for Aca- demic Excellence to Joel McDade. Another highlight has been the Fall Picnic hosted by our second year graduate students during which the faculty retained the honor of winning the annual faculty - student softball game. Unlike last year, when many of the graduate students departed before the game to play intramural softball for \"The Phizz,\" this year the faculty won against a full complement of students, and with only the slightest stacking of the deck. Clearly Forbes was correct when he said \"Victory is sweetest when you've known defeat.\" Thank goodness for our imported ace left fielder! Our most recent event was the 20th Annual Fall Research Forum . There was an energetic poster session, as well as oral presentations from four graduate student finalists in competition for the Horace W. Davenport Research Award. The winner this year was Kelli VanDussen, a MIP graduate student in Linda Samuelson's lab who presented on \"Notch -Regulated Mechanisms of Intestinal Secretory Lineage Development and Stem Cell Marker Expression.\" The key- note address, \"Novel Mechanisms Regulating Glucose Transport in Skeletal Muscle,\" was given by Laurie Goodyear of the Joslin Diabetes Center and Harvard Medical School. The graduate students in the Molecular & Integrative Physiology department are raising funds for an endowment entitled \"Graduate Education Fund in Physiology\". Their initial goal is to raise $100,000 in three years, which will then be doubled by a match by the Medical School. Through sponsorship for the Dexter to Ann Arbor Run, sales of MIP T -shirts, and foundation support, they have achieved their first year goal of just over $33,000. Interest generated by the endow- ment will be disbursed to support priorities such as research grants for high impact/high risk experiments, equipment, travel expenses for scientific meetings and stipends. Thus, this endowment will be used to propel the development of future generations of biomedical re- searchers & teachers, many of whom will study the mechanistic un- derpinnings of human maladies such as cancer, heart disease, diabe- tes, and obesity, translate these findings into bedside treatments, as well as train and educate future generations of our scientific commu- nity.

This occasion causes me to reflect and put things into perspective. When I moved here with my family in 1972, my wife Nora and I considered Ann Arbor a temporary stopover until a job came up in New England, closer to where we grew up. But after being here a year or so, we came to realize this was the place for us. I was stimulat- ed and challenged by the tremendous professional opportunities and great col- leagues, and we were both hooked by the wonderful intellectual environment and cultural diversity of the University and Ann Arbor community, not to mention our passion for UM sports. Not only did I have a hard time imagining a better place professionally, this was a great place to raise our kids. We never regretted our decision to stay. Sure, there have been some bumps and rough spots along my career path here, but these were far outweighed by the fabulous opportunities provided by the University and the Physiology Department. As just one example, I cannot think of another Medical School where a group of beginning faculty and their students and staff could build, from the ground up, a world -class facility for conducting research on sheep in a semi -agricultural setting - all with a total starting budget under twenty thousand dollars! This and other opportunities here have enabled me to achieve something special as we investigated neuro- endocrine mechanisms that govern reproduction. For sure, the research itself has been quite a trip and our lab has been recognized by our fair share of honors along the way. I have had wonderful colleagues, collaborators and students, and an incredibly tal- ented and dedicated research staff. But as I think back, I am convinced that my greatest contribution has been the develop- ment of graduate students and postdoctoral fellows. Their successes both here in our lab, and especially since they have left, have given me enormous satisfaction and great pride. And as icing on the cake, I had the opportunity to direct the MIP Graduate Program during the four years before I began my retirement furlough. So as my own lab and research group were winding down, I had a new opportunity - a chance to share my insights and experiences with the entire MIP student body. I have gained great satisfaction working with this group of wonderful students and experiencing their growth as individuals and scientists. On a personal level, my wife Nora and I have enjoyed our closely -knit scientific family that emerged over the years. This has had a huge impact on the growth and enrichment of our own biological family. We look forward to continuing these interactions for many years to come. So as I look back on my time here at Michigan, there are so many positive thoughts that will carry for- ward into retirement. I wish to thank all that have shared in this experience .

One of the big- gest challenges for Kyle and me this year was to organize and coordi- nate MIP post -doc meetings and create a venue where post -docs can socialize, network, and present their research to fellow colleagues. The format of our meetings was simple: lunch, research data presenta- tion, and a final discussion. The attendance has averaged 70 -80% of the total number of MIP post -docs, a considerable achievement given the inception of these meetings in just the last year. A lot of questions were asked at these meetings and each of the speakers has spoken positively of the experience and ideas generated from much of the feedback. Thus, these meetings have provided an opportunity for all the post -docs to hear about one another's area of research. Most im- portantly, it has provided an excellent opportunity for post -docs to exchange technical know -how, reagents, share professional advice, and get to know each other. At some of our first meetings, we had the opportunity to invite Peter Hitchcock, the Director of UMMS Office of Postdoctoral Stud- ies, and William Brackenbury, the current President of UMPDA. Both highlighted the resources available to Physiology post -docs and dis- cussed upcoming events. Our accomplishment this year was our invitation to host an ex- ternal speaker. After submitting several names of interest, MIP post - docs voted to invite Jared Rutter, Associate Professor from the Uni- versity of Utah. Dr. Rutter's research focuses on the role of the nutri- ent sensing PAS kinase and its control of energy metabolism. His seminar was well attended, and in addition to his excellent presenta- tion, Dr. Rutter provided the post -docs with helpful advice on how to search for faculty positions, lead a successful research group, and carve out a unique research niche. Last July, a post -doc meeting was organized at the Arrythmia Center since a number of post -docs travel from across campus to MSII to attend our monthly meetings. We would like to thank Jose Jalife for facilitating the organization of this meeting and sponsoring refreshments. On October 10th, the university -wide post -doc association (UMPDA), hosted its first regional meeting entitled \"Career Roadmaps for Post -docs\" This meeting included post -docs from sev- eral institutions including the University of Michigan, Michigan State University, and Wayne State University. The upcoming months will mark a transition period where Kyle Sousa will serve as the MIP post - doc society's next President along with the election of a new Vice - President. We anticipate looking forward to continuing these orga- nized meetings and activities. Finally, the MIP post -docs would like to extend a message of thanks to the Department of Molecular and Integrative Physiology for encouraging the inception and continued success of our departmental post -doc society. Maria Eugenia Sabbatini, President Kyle Sousa, Vice -President The Department recently initiated a summer undergraduate research program that had its kick -off June - August of 2009. The program website is at http://sitemaker.umich.edu/mipsummerfellowship/home . The MIP Undergraduate Fellowship was overseen by Dr. Ormond MacDougald, with assistance from Dan Michele, and had as its goal, recruitment of undergraduate students from other institutions for a summer research experience in a MIP laboratory at the University of Michigan. While the long trem goal was to increase the quality and quantity of strong applicants for our graduate program, in a larger context, the goal was also to increase interest in biomedical research as a career, and to make more sci- entifically informed citizens. We enrolled nine undergraduate students from six institutions. While the foundation of the undergraduate student's research experience was in the laboratory, we supplemented their education with a number of opportunities including a summer lecture series and a mini - symposium in which the fellows gave oral presentations on their summer research project and findings. Funding for the studen t stipends came from several sources, including American Recovery and Reinvestment Act funds, the National Science Foundation, the University of Michigan Horace H. Rackham School of Graduate Studies, and Calvin College. Bolstered by a highly successful initial year, the Departme nt of MIP in- tends to continue the summer undergraduate research program.

M o l e c u l a r & I n t e g r a t i v e Physiology University of Michigan, Molecular & Integrative Physiology 1137 E. Catherine St., Rm, 7744, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 -5622 Where Are They Now? Spotlight on Alumni Robert D. Phair, Ph.D. University of Michigan, Physiology 1977, conducted his dissertation research on metabolic control of blood flow with Dr. Harvey Sparks and the late Dr. John Jacquez. He came to Ann Arbor after serving 5 years in the US Public Health Service, including three years in the Laboratory of Mathematical Biology in the National Cancer Institute at the NIH where he worked with Dr. Mones Berman, who, like Dr. Jacquez, was one of the pre -eminent figures in the early days of data -driven computer modeling of biological systems. Dr. Phair's un- dergraduate degree was in Electrical Engineering from MIT, but his dream was always to apply engineering meth- ods to the analysis of complex biological systems. After a 1 -year post -doc with Dr. Sumer Pek at the UM Medical School working on cellular endocrinology, Dr. Phair was recruited by Drs. Vernon Mountcastle and William Milnor and joined the faculty of The Johns Hopkins School of Medicine as Assistant Professor of Physiology. After 17 years studying calcium signaling in vascular smooth muscle, plasma lipoprotein metabolism, and athero- sclerosis, he left Hopkins having attained the ranks of Associate Professor of Physiology and Associate Professor of Biomedic al Engi- neering. Dr. Phair is co -founder and Chief Scientific Officer of Integrative Bioinformatics Inc (IBI), a consulting and software develop- ment firm based in the heart of Silicon Valley in the San Francisco Bay area. IBI's software product, called ProcessDB (www.integrativebioinformatics.com/processdb ), is designed to manage the process of large scale modeling and integration of dynamic experiments from the level of molecular cell biology to physiology. Dr. Phair is married to Ann Chasson, a software engineer, with whom he travels the world and rides his snowboard whenever possible. He is proud to wear his UM MIP tee -shirt despite its being white instead of maize and blue, and is looking forward to giving a MIP Seminar in September of 2010. Nancy Wayne received her PhD from the Department of Physiology in 1988, working on \"Pineal regulation of seasonal breeding in the ewe: Interactions of environment signals with endogenous rhythms\" with Dr. Fred Karsch. She then spent four years at the University of Virginia with Dr. Gene Block, developing an invertebrate model of reproductive neuroendocrinology for understanding cell physiological mechanisms underlying excita- tion-secretion coupling. Dr. Wayne became a faculty member in the Department of Physiology at the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA in 1992, and was promoted to Professor in 2005. She is heavily involved in teaching the first -year medical curriculum. She still holds on to her early edition Human Physiology text- book by Vander, Sherman and Luciano, as well as Davenport's classic Digest of Digestion - Hail! Hail! to Michigan, the leaders and the best! Her current research program uses transgenic fish to understand mecha- nisms regulating the cell physiology of gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) neurons in the intact neural network. In addition to research and teaching, Dr. Wayne is involved in campus -wide administration as Special Assistant to the Chancellor for Academic Projects. Dr. Wayne hopes at some point to get back to The University of Michigan b efore she retires. "}
