In 201 6, BRFSS collected 7,257 telephone interviews from residents , age 18 and o lder, living in private residences or college housing regarding health conditions, health -related behaviors, attitudes and awareness of major contributors to illness, disability and pre mature death. BRFSS also monitors the prevalence of these indicators over time statewide. Health -related issues analyzed include general health status, health care access, tobacco use, alcohol consumption, body weight, physical activity, nutrition, diabete s, respiratory conditions, immunizations, cancer screening and HIV/AIDS testing . Comparisons are made to other states and to Healthy People 2020 and Healthy Iowans goals. Significant findings for 2016 include: The downward trend in the percentage of people without health care coverage leveled off. Only four states ha d a lower rate of current asthma. Although the percentage of obese Iowans was steady, the percentage of Iowans above a healthy weight was the highest in six years. Cigarette smoking showed a dec line, especially in the youngest age group. This is likely due, in part, to a switch to e -cigarettes. There were only four states with a higher prevalence of reported binge drinking , and only two states that ha d a higher percentage reporting driving while intoxicated. The percentage of Iowans age 65 and older who received a flu vaccination ranked second among states. Prevalence of people receiving a pneumonia shot was the highest in six years for the second year in a row. There were only two states with a l ower percentage than Iowa for people being tested for HIV. The percentage of adults reporting being diagnosed with depression was the lowest level found in the past six years , and was a major reversal of the trend from previous years.

Introduction History In 198 4, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) launched the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) , working in an ongoing fashion with several states to assess the health status and health risk behaviors of their citizens. In 1988, Iowa began full participation in BRFSS. The BRFSS is now conducted in all 50 st ates, the District of Columbia and a few American territories . Nature of the Survey The Iowa BRFSS is an ongoing telephone survey. It is financially and technically supported by the CDC with further financial support from public and private sources. The BRFSS is designed to collect information from residents age 18 and over living in private residences or college housing on health conditions, health -related behaviors, attitudes and awareness. It also monitors the prevalence of these indicators over time. The indicators surveyed are major contributors to illness, disability and premature death. This report focuses on the d ata collected during calendar year 201 6. Some of the health -related issues discussed are general health status, health care access, cancer screening, tobacco use, alcohol consumption, body weight, physical activity, oral health, diabetes, respiratory condi tions, immunizations and HIV/AIDS awareness. Objectives The objectives of the BRFSS are: 1. To determine the state specific prevalence of personal health behaviors related to the leading causes of premature death. 2. To develop the capacity of state hea lth departments to conduct credible telephone surveys. 3. To advance the understanding that certain health -related behaviors are critical indicators of health. Use of BRFSS Data The CDC developed the BRFSS to help states assess health risks and monitor t rends. Comparable surveillance methods are used in all states. This allows for comparisons among states and for the assessment of geographic patterns of risk factor prevalence. The BRFSS information is used to design, implement and support public health a ctivities. These activities are designed to reduce the premature death and disability of Iowa residents. State public health departments are responsible for planning, implementing and evaluating disease prevention programs. Many of these programs involve health risk behavior modification. Examples of health risk behavior modification programs in Iowa are the Diabetes Prevention and Control Program, nutrition and physical activity campaigns, tobacco cessation and counter -marketing campaigns, campaigns encou raging flu vaccination and campaigns to increase health screenings and checkups. Iowa Department of Public Health 5 One way to assess program effectiveness is to monitor the prevalence of risk factors in the population. Comparing different times, demographic groups or geographic areas may be quite useful in developing, implementing and e valuating intervention programs. Iowa Department of Public Health 6 2. Methodology Questionnaire Design The BRFSS questionnaire is updated each calendar year by the CDC and by each participating state. The questionnaire consists of three sections: 1) the core questions required of all states participating in BRFSS; 2) a set of standardized modules developed by the CDC which states may opt to include in their survey and 3) state -added questions which are designed and administered by individual states to address locally identified health problems. Changes in core and optional module questions were discussed and determinations were made whether to offer them at an annual national BRFSS meeting. They have been previously tested. A group of interested individuals from the Iowa Department of Public Health , guided by the state coordinator , met to discuss which optional modules and state -added questions to include in t he coming year. The emerging survey plan was reviewed by the Iowa BRFSS Advisory Committee. Participation by Iowans in the BRFSS survey is random, anonymous, voluntary and confidential. Survey participants are requested to provide such demographic informa tion as age, sex, race, marital and employment status, annual household income, educational level and location of residence by county and ZIP code. Information that could possibly be used to identify the respondent , such as location , is suppressed in publi c use data. Sampling Process Two sampling frames are used in the BRFSS. One is for landline telephones, while the other is for cell phones. Only adults age 18 years and older were interviewed in both samples. People residing in group homes or institutions were not sampled. In the landline sample , one person residing in a household was interviewed. Households were selected using list -assisted random -digit dialing. This method provides a list of randomly chosen phone numbers from the pool of all existing la ndline phone numbers. These numbers are not drawn in a simple random fashion, but use what is known as the disproportionate stratified sampling technique (DSS). This sampling methodology was designed to produce a random sample of Iowa telephone numbers, including unlisted numbers and new subscribers , in an efficient fashion. The DSS method divides landline phone numbers into two strata. The first stratum is residential but unlisted. The second stratum is composed of residential listed numbers. Each stratum was sampled at a different rate. The listed residential numbers were sampled at the highest rate. Some numbers were marked by the list provider as not to be called because they have been predetermined to be nonresidential or nonworking. There was no set nu mber to be sampled per group and completed interviews were not thrown out. The landline sample was also stratified into six geographic regions. These regions are the same regions used by health resource and emergency planning groups within the state. Geogr aphic regions were represented at the same proportion as their population within the state. A seventh stratum was drawn from census tracts throughout the state containing a relatively high percentage of African American or Hispanic residents in an effort t o better represent minority groups in Iowa. There was also an eighth stratum that oversampled counties of special interest to the diabetes program. Iowa Department of Public Health 7 Increasingly many people, including the young, single, ethnic minorities and renters , are opting not to use traditional landline telephone service in favor of cell phones (AAPOR Cell Phone Task Force 2010; Blumberg & Luke 201 7). Therefore, another sampling frame was added devoted to households having cell phones. Iowans were interviewed on whichever phone type t hey were reached. The number of cell phone interviews was set large enough that more than 25 percent of the sample should be users of cell phones only. The cell phone sample was also geographically stratified into the six regions. The oversample strata wer e not done , since it is not possible to determine such specific geography for cell phones. Since the cell phone is more an individual appliance than a household appliance, the selection of one person per household was not done. College housing was included in the cell phone sample. These respondents were also asked some extra questions ; for instance, they were asked if they were doing anything that would make it unsafe to conduct the interview , and not interviewed if they were. Because of mobility of cell phone use, t here were occasions when cell phone interviews were done involving people living in other states. The number of cell phone interviews in our sample is, therefore, larger than the number called by our data collection contractor. Cell phone inte rviews from other states only contained responses to the core questions , since there was no way for them to know which modules we were using or our state added questions. Approximately equal numbers of interviews per month were conducted from January throu gh December in 2016 for a total sample size of 7,257. Of these, 3,728 were landline and 3,529 were cell phone. Interviews were conducted in both English and Spanish. Interviewers made multiple attempts to reach a number to complete an interview before repl acing that number. If the person selected to take the survey was not available, an appointment was made to complete the interview at another date and time. If the person was not available during the interview period, or if the person refused to participate , no other person was interviewed at that number. Attempts were made to convert initial refusals into participants. The Interview Process The interviews were conducted daytime, evenings and weekends with appointments as needed to schedule or complete int erviews. The average time to complete an interview was 25.8 minutes for landline , and 23.5 minutes for cell phone. The response rate, defined as completed interviews + partial completes divided by all eligible households called, was 53 percent for landline and 55 percent for cell phones*. Although the response rates seem rather low and have been declining in recent years, they are better than most states produce. Not all interviews were fully completed. A partial complete is an interview that was termina ted before it was complete, but sufficient data had been collected to use for most measures. This means that results from questions later in the questionnaire are determined from a somewhat smaller sample than earlier questions , even when not restricted to some sub -sample such as a particular age group. See Appendix 3 for the questions and their order. A Computer Aided Telephone Interviewing (CATI) system was used. The CATI system not only assists interviewers in presenting the questionnaire and recording the responses, it also helps keep track of appointments and callback attempts, and reports statistic s of call dispositions. *Cell phone statistics are only for those done by our contractor. Some cell phone interviews of Iowa residents are done by other states. Iowa Department of Public Health 8 Advantages and Limitations Telephone interviews provide a means to conduct affordable surveys to monitor the prevalence of behavioral risk factors. Surveys based on telephone interviews are much faster to complete than surveys based on in -person interviews. In one hour, an experienc ed telephone interviewer can handle busy numbers, calls not answered, and refusals to participate, and still successfully complete one and one - half interviews. In contrast, in one day of in -person interviewing, many miles of travel may be required with few interviews completed. Another advantage of telephone surveys is the much higher response rate compared to self - administered surveys, such as mail surveys. Supervision and administration are simpler for telephone interviews than for in -person interviews. All calls can be made from one central location and supervisors can monitor interviewers for quality control. One main limitation to telephone surveys is that all Iowans are not reachable by telephone. Some do not live in households , but are in institutio ns such as nursing homes or prisons. Some households do not have telephones. Persons of low socioeconomic status are less likely than persons of higher socioeconomic status to have uninterrupted telephone service and are therefore under -sampled. Furthermo re, the percentage of households with a telephone varies by region. New telephone technology such as caller I.D. and call blockers that block telemarketers also pose problems for telephone surveys. Furthermore, some inaccuracy is expected from any survey b ased on self -reported information. For example, respondents are known to under -report their weight and inaccurately recall socially undesirable habits. People's memories may also fail or play tricks on them. The potential for bias must always be kept in mi nd when interpreting self -reported data. Despite these limitations, prevalence estimates from the BRFSS correspond well with findings from surveys based on in -person interviews and actual physical measurements, including studies conducted by the National C enter for Health Statistics and the American Heart Association. Analysis of the data Unless everyone in the state was asked questions about his or her health, there would be no way to know exactly what these answers would be. When analyzing BRFSS data, co nclusions are to be drawn about the entire adult population of the state of Iowa based on only a sample of randomly chosen people . The true prevalence in the population can only be estimated. The judgment of the value of prevalence in a population, such as the state based on the prevalence within a sample, always involves educated guesswork. The prevalence values from the survey and the true state population prevalence values may differ by some amount, but a range of state values that are probably true can be determined with a high degree of confidence from the prevalence in the sample. Most charts and tables in this report will indicate a range of values in which there is a 95 percent chance of the true Iowa value falling. This range is referred to as a 9 5 percent confidence interval (CI). Charts will indicate this by use of a black line at the end of the bars in the chart. The end of the bar is the sample value, while the value in the population is probably somewhere in the range represented by the Iowa Department of Public Health 9 line. When the CIs of two or more groups do not overlap, their population values can be considered truly or significantly different. An important factor in determining how well we can judge the response of all Iowans from the survey sample is the number of respo nses to the questions. The smaller the number of responses, the poorer is our ability to draw a conclusion about the whole state. Analyzing the data by such categories as age, sex, income, educational level and especially race/ethnicity means there are a s maller number of interviews in each particular group than in the whole survey. Furthermore, many questions are only answered depending on the answer to previous questions. For instance, a person would only be asked at what age they were diagnosed with diab etes if they answer \"yes\" to whether they have ever been told they had diabetes. These smaller numbers decrease the ability to determine statistically significant differences. Some data may not be reported as significant solely due to small sample sizes. In general, data in which the number of responses is less than 50 or the variability is too large (coefficient of variability greater than 30 percent ) will not be reported since this data is considered highly unreliable. Some people refuse to answer select questions , but choose to respond to the majority of the questions. Those interviews were still used in the final count for the total sample size. However, they were not counted on the specific questions they refused. Unless otherwise indicated, prevalenc e measures do not include those who refused to answer a question or said they did not know. Weighting of the Data Generally, the best guess for how many Iowa adults would answer a question a certain way would be the same as how many adults in the sample a nswer that way. This is true, however, only if everyone in the state had an equal chance of being in the sample . This is not the case. The number of adults per household and the number of phone numbers per household influence a person's likelihood of being included in the survey. Furthermore, certain demographic groups may be over or under -represented in the sample based on their ease of being reached and willingness to respond. For instance, about half the adult Iowa population is male, but typically only about 40 percent of the sample interviewed is male. To solve these problems , the data in the sample is weighted to the state population. That means several of the above factors are used to give each interview a weight that represents a certain distinct num ber of people in the state population. A landline telephone is seen as a household appliance, while a cell phone is more frequently seen as an individual possession. This means adults per household and phone numbers per household become irrelevant for cell phones. These two factors are not used in determining weights for cell phone interviews. A large number of factors are considered in the weighting process. Age, gender, race/ethnicity, marital status, education level, home ownership, geographic region, an d cell vs. landline telephone are all considered. Preliminary weights from the ratio of sampled phone numbers to all numbers are adjusted recursively by these factors until a stable weight is produced. Unfortunately, this weighting method has only been in place since 2011. This has disrupted trend information for the data. Trend information in this report will only be determined from 2011 forward. Even comparisons of data from 2011 may be unsound for optional module and state added questions , since 2012 i s the first year cell phone interviews have been conducted for these.

General Health Status and Health -Related Quality of Life Background General health status defined by responses to a single question such as \"How is your health, in general?\" have been found to be significant predictors of mortality. Additional studies that contro lled for objective health status, age, sex, life satisfaction, income, residence and other factors continue to find that the risk of mortality is two to six times greater for those individuals who had reported earlier that their health was bad or poor, com pared to those who had reported their health as excellent ( DeSalvo, Bloser, Reynolds, He, & Muntner, 2006) . The risk associated with poor self -rated health was actually higher than the risks associated with poor health status assessments by a physician. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has defined health -related quality of life (HRQOL) as \"an individual's or group's perceived physical and mental health over time\" (C enters for Disease Control, 2016 ). Physicians have often used HRQOL to measure the effects of chronic illness in their patients to understand better how an illness interferes with a person's day -to-day life. Similarly, public health professionals use health -related quality of life to measure the effects of numerous disorders , short - and long -term disabilities, and diseases in different populations. Tracking health -related quality of life in different populations can identify subgroups with poor physical or mental health and can help guide policies or interventions to improve their health. Self-ratings of health, or health -related quality of life, seek to determine how people perceive their own health and how well they function physically and psychologically during their usual daily activities. These indicators are important b ecause they can assess dysfunction and disability that are not measured by standard morbidity and mortality measures. General Health Status Results In 2016, when asked how their health was in general, 17.8 percent of respondents reported that it was excellent. Another 37.5 percent said it was very good. While 30.8 percent reported good health, 13.9 percent rated their health as fair or poor. This is somewhat worse than the figure from 2015 , when 13 percent rated their health as fair or poor (see figure 4 .1). Age, education, household income and race/ethnicity all had a significant impact on reported health status (see table 4.1). While only 5.6 percent of those from households earning $75,000 or more per year reported fair or poor health, 39.5 percent of those from households earning less than $15,000 per year did so. Other respondents who were more likely to report having fair or poor health were those with less than a high school education, Hispanics, and Non -Hispanics of other race or multi -racial. Thos e with a college education, those with hous ehold incomes $50,000 or higher and those age 18 to 34 years all reported less than 10 percent with fair or poor health. In answer to the question about how many days during the past 30 days was their physical hea lth not good, 68.5 percent of respondents reported none of the days and 9.6 percent reported 14 days or more. Iowa Department of Public Health 14 Figure 4.1: Percentage of Self -Reported Fair or Poor General Health Status by year As shown in Table 4.2, more females, older age, lower edu cation and lower income people reported 14 or more bad physical health days. People with household incomes less than $15,000 reported 27.3 percent having 14 or more bad physical health days, while people with household incomes of $75,000 or more had only 3.1 percent. When responding to the question of how many days during the past 30 days their mental health was not good, 69.6 percent of the respondents indicated none of the days and 10 percent reported 14 or more days. Fourteen or more days in the past 3 0 of bad mental health is referred to as frequent mental distress (FMD). Table 4.2 shows the pattern for FMD. Men, older people, those with high education and those with high income had a lower prevalence of FMD. An annual household income of $15,000 o r less had the highest percentage of people with FMD (23.5%). Those who were age 75 and older had the lowest prevalence of FMD (4.4%). When asked how many days poor physical or mental health kept them from performing their usual activities, 60.5 percent of those with some days of either bad physical or mental health said none. On the other hand, 12.5 percent said 14 days or more. This level increased with increasing age, decreasing education and decreasing income. Comparison with Other States The percentag e of people rating their health as fair or poor throughout the states and District of Columbia ranged from 1 1.6 percent to 2 6.3 percent. The median value was 16.4 percent. Iowa ranked in the top 10 best states , with only 13.9 percent rating their health as fair or poor. 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 Year 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 Status 13.0 14.0 14.4 13.6 13.0 13.903691215Percent Year Iowa Department of Public Health 15 Table 4.1: Percentage of Self -Reported Fair or Poor General Health Status, 2016 DEMOGRAPHIC GROUPS General Health Status Fair or Poor % C.I.

Insurance Coverage and Access to Health Care Background Access to health care is important for the prevention of disease, the detection of illness through screening, treatment and management of illness and injuries. Adults who have a usual source of care are much more likely to use the health c are system and obtain needed services ( National Center for Health Statistics , 2011). For those who lack health insurance, it may be impossible to obtain adequate health care. This not only includes expensive surgery and hospital stays, but also preventive care, management of chronic disorders such as diabetes or hypertension, and emergency treatment. Such a lack of access to health care allows small easily -treatable problems to become major health problems for many individuals (Hadley , 2007). Accurate estim ates of the uninsured are important to obtain. The landscape of health care coverage is rapidly changing with the implementation of the Affordable Care Act. It is critical to evaluate the effects of these vast changes in the health care delivery system. Health care costs have increased. This is especially true of particular sectors of costs , such as pharmaceuticals. Such increases hit harder on individuals without health insurance and those living on fixed incomes. Both access and affordability of health care are important areas to monitor. Insurance Coverage and Access to Health Care Results In 2016, 6.5 percent of adult Iowans reported they had no health insurance. In 2015 , the figure was 6.3 percent. For Iowans between age 18 and 64 years old, the figure was 7.8 percent , which is identical to the previous year (see figure 5.1). All remaining findings for coverage are for this age group , since almost everyone 65 years and older is covered by Medicare. It appears that the rapid decline in people without coverage , which has been seen in recent years , has stopped. Table 5.1 shows that for people between ages 18 and 64 years , more males, younger people, less educated people, people with lower incomes , and racial and ethnic minorities were more likely to lack any health care coverage. People with less than a high school education had the highest percentage of individuals without health care coverage (27%). Both college graduates and people from househol ds earning $75,000 per year had fewer than 3 percent having no coverage. Two other demographic variables that had an impact on health care coverage were employment status and marital status. Unemployed Iowans reported 17.6 percent being not covered by heal th insurance, while 6 percent of employed or self -employed were not covered. Unemployed here excludes people who are retired or unable to work. People who were married were much more likely to have health care coverage than those who were not. Only 4.4 per cent of married respondents were without coverage, while 11.8 percent of unmarried respondents were not covered Iowa Department of Public Health 18 Figure 5.1: No Health Insurance Coverage Trend 2011 - 2016 Iowans Age 18 -64 When asked if there was a time in the past 12 months when they needed to see a doctor but could not because of the cost, 7.7 percent of all adult Iowans said that there was. The percentage was higher for younger people, people with less educa tion, people w ith lower incomes and racial and ethnic minorities. The youngest age group departed from these trends having a lower percentage who could not afford cost than the next higher group (see table 5.2). The lowest percentage s were found in people with annual h ousehold incomes of $75,000 or more and people age 65 and over. These both had just over 2 percent not covered . The highest percentage s were found in people from households earning less than $15,000 per year and in non -Hispanic people of other races or mul ti-racial. These both had nearly 21 percent not covered. Since it is important that care be coordinated, respondents were asked if they had one person they thought of as their personal doctor or health care provider. A positive reply was given by 77.2 perc ent of adult Iowans. Women, White non -Hispanics, older people, people with more education and people with higher household incomes were more likely to report a regular provider. Hispanics were least likely to report one regular provider (61.2%), while thos e age 65 years old and older were most likely (87.5%). When asked how long it had been since their last regular checkup, 71.6 percent said less than one year. On the other end, 1 percent said they had never had a checkup. Female s or older people were more likely to have a checkup in the past year. Iowans who were 65 years old or older were most likely to have a checkup (8 8.6%), while those from age 25 to 34 years were least likely (58.8% ). Non -Hispanic people of other race or multi -racial also had fewer than 60 percent with an annual checkup. 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 14.2 13.4 12.7 9.6 7.8 7.80246810121416Percent Year Iowa Department of Public Health 19 Table 5.1 Percentage of Iowans age 18 -64 lacking health insurance, 2016 DEMOGRAPHIC GROUPS No Health Insurance Coverage Age 18 -64 % C.I.

Only five states had a lower percentage of residents without health insurance than Iowa did . Iowa had 7.8 percent of its non-elderly respondents reporting not having any insurance. The median for states and the District of Columbia was 12.3 percent. Health Objectives for Iowa and the Nation The Healthy People 2020 and Healthy Iowans goals for health insurance coverage are to see all people be covered by some form of health insurance. In Iowa, only 92.2 percent of non - elderly adults have coverage. For all adults the figure was 93.5 percent. This is short of both goal s. Having one specific source of primary care also missed the mark. Healthy People 2020 has separate goals for people age 18 to 64 and people 65 and over. The goal for 18 to 64 is 89.2 percent, while the goal for age 65 and over is 100 percent. The results for Iowa were 74.4 percent and 8 7.5 percent , respectively. The Healthy Iowans goal for all adults was 82.5 percent. The obtained prevalence of 77.2 percent also falls short. References 1. National Center for Health Statistics.

Exercise and Physical Activity Background A lifestyle lacking in regular physical activity has been associated with an increased risk for cardio - vascular illness, cancer, osteoporosis and other debilitating conditions (National Center for Health Statistics , 2008) . Despite its risks, a large proportion of people remain inactive. Although the percentage of people who do not engage in regular physical activity remains high, many efforts are underway to try to increase the physical activity level of Iowans. The Iowa Department of Public He alth is actively working to increase the physical activity levels of Iowans. A lifestyle change may be as simple as taking the stairs instead of the elevator. Interventions to increase physical activity include: 1) Creating a culture where physical activity i s the easy choice. 2) Creating the commitment of Iowans to walk and bike for transportation. 3) Creating policies that enable Iowans to be physically active. 4) Increasing the number of complete streets. (A complete street is a street that has been designed with all users in mind - cars, cyclists and pedestrians.) 5) Developing recreational trails. 6) Enhancing worksite wellness programs. 7) Continuing to promote physical activity and the built environment by the Iowa Department of Public Health and other organizati ons. Encouraging people to have a less sedentary lifestyle by engaging in regular physical activity continues to be a significant step toward a healthier Iowa. Exercise and Physical Activity Results In 2016, 77.3 percent of respondents reported that th ey had engaged in some sort of physical activity for exercise during the past month other than their regular job. This is better than in 2015 , when only 73.7 percent had engaged in exercise , but is about the same as the 77.4 percent found in 2014 (see figure 6.1 ). Although the prevalence of exercise varies from year to year, the overall trend appears level. A larger proportion of younger respondents reported engaging in leisure physical activity than older respondents. The percentage of respondents who exer cised also increased with education and household income. This percentage was somewhat higher for White non -Hispanics than for other racial or ethnic groups and for men. The lowest percentage of all examined demographic variables was for those age 75 years and older (62.8%), while the highest was for those age 18 to 24 years (88.3%). Since the neighborhood environment can have much influence on a person's level of physical activity, a module was asked about the neighborhood environment. It was found that 75.9 percent of Iowans rated their neighborhood as a very pleasant place to walk. Sidewalks were said to be present by 67.2 percent of Iowans. Only 27.2 percent of Iowans used schools for public recreational activity. However, 65.9 percent of Iowans said t hey used walking trails or parks in their community. Iowa Department of Public Health 22 Figure 6.1: Percentage of Iowans engaging in leisure -time physical activity in the past 30 days by year, 2011 -2016 Comparison with Other States Values for the measure of not engaging in leisure time physical activity in the 50 states and the District of Columbia ranged from a low of 1 5.7 percent to a high of 3 2.5 percent. Iowa ranked better than the median of 23.2 percent on not engaging in leisure time physical activity at 22.7 percent. Health Objectives for Iowa and the Nation The national target for reducing the proportion of adults who engage in no leisure -time physical activity is 32.6 percent. Iowa's level of 22.7 percent is much better than this target. References National Center for Health Statistics.

Obesity is a condition linked to risk fa ctors for heart disease, cancer and stroke, which are all leading causes of death. It is associated with type 2 diabetes, atherosclerosis (hardening of the arteries), gout, asthma, hypertension, sleep apnea and osteoarthritis ( U. S. Department of Health and Human Services , 2001). Obesi ty has been increasing so rapidly that it may be regarded as an epidemic. The origin of overweight involves many factors. It reflects inherited, environmental, cultural and socioeconomic traits. The increase in the prevalence of being overweight is a result of a shift in energy balance in which energy taken in from food is great er than energy used in physical activity (Centers for Dise ase Control and Prevention, 2016 ). Strateg ies to combat obesity would seek to advance policies that : Increase the availability of affordable he althy foods in all communities; Increase the frequency, intensity and duration of physical activity; Improve access to safe and heal thy places to live, work, learn and play; Limit screen time; and Encourage employers to provide workplace wellness programs. Exact measurements of body fat require sophisticated equipment. To eliminate this problem , obesity is often estimated from weight standards that are adjusted for body frame. Carefully measured weight and height remain the most easily performed and useful means to determine nutritional status an d to predict mortality for the general population (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2015) . Body mass index (BMI) is used to determine the appropriateness of weight for a person's height. BMI is defined as a person's body weight in kilograms divi ded by their height in meters squared [weight (kg)/height (m2)]. Estimations of the prevalence of overweight and obesity in this report are based on BMI determined from self -reported weight and height. In adults, overweight is considered to be a BMI value greater than or equal to 25 and less than 30. Obesity is considered to be a BMI greater than or equal to 30. This self -report method is likely to result in an underestimation of the actual extent of obesity. However, comparisons among states , demographic g roups such as age or income levels , and years are likely to be valid. Furthermore, this is the only measure of overweight and obesity available on the state level. Obesity and its associated health problems have a large economic impact on the U nited States. Medical costs associated with overweight and obesity may involve direct and indirect costs. Direct medical costs may include preventive, diagnostic and treatment services related to obesity. Indirect costs relate to morbidity and mortality costs , inclu ding productivity. In 2008 dollars, direct medical costs were estimated to be $147 billion. The annual nationwide productive costs of obesity range between $3.38 billion and $6.38 billion. Because of the large number of people in the Baby Boomer generation and its high rate of obesity, as this population ages, obesity -related costs to Medicare are likely to grow significantly. In 2007 -2008, 5.7 million men and 16.5 million women who were eligible for military service exceeded the Army's enlistment standards for weight and body fat. There are other costs as well Iowa Department of Public Health 25 that are more difficult to estimate . For instance, because people are fatter, airlines spend more on jet fuel and the obese themselves spend more on gas oline ( Herper , 2009) . It is estimated that Iowa could save 5.7 billion dollars by 2030 if BMI were lowered by just 5 percent (The Trust for America's Health, 2013) . Overweight and Obesity Results The BRFSS data show that in 2016 , 36.7 percent of non -pregnant adult Iowans we re overweight and 32 percent were obese, based on BMI. The combined percentage of individuals who were overweight or obese was 68.7 percent. This combined prevalence is higher than that in 2015 ; however, the rate of obesity has remained the same while the rate of those overweight has increased. In 2015 , 34.5 percent of non -pregnant adult Iowans were overweight and 32.1 percent were obese (see figure 7.1). The level of overweight and overweight and obesity combined were the highest they ha ve been in the last six years. Demographic factors behave somewhat differently for overweight and obesity. The self -reported weights show more males than females are overweight and obese. Prevalence of overweight and obesity increase with age until middle age. A large declin e is seen in obesity, but not overweight, for people age 75 and older. More males are obese than females , except between ages 25 to 44. Females actually show a higher prevalence of obesity than males between ages 25 and 34. Figure 7.1: Overweight and Obesity by Year , 2011 -2016 The effects of education and income are different for overweight and obesity as well . Obesity prevalence is lowest for college graduates, but education has little systematic effect on overweight. If anything, college graduates ar e slightly more likely to be overweight. Likewise, t he percentage overweight tends to be lower at lower incomes. On the other hand, obesity is less 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 Overweight 35.8 34.3 35.7 t Obesity Combined Iowa Department of Public Health 26 Figure 7.2: Obesity by Age and Sex, 2016 Figure 7.3: Overweight and Obesity by Income, Iowa 2016 051015202530354045 18 - 24 25 - 34 35 - 44 45 - 54 55 - 64 65-74 75+Percent AgeMale Fe...

Comparison with Other States Iowa's figure of 32 percent obese in 2016 was well above the U.S. median of 2 9.9 percent . The range of prevalence among the 50 states and District of Columbia for obesity ranged from a low of 2 2.3 percent to a high of 3 7.7 percent. For obesity and overweight combined , Iowa had a prevalence of 6 8.7 percent compared to a U.S. median of 6 5.4 percent. Iowa Department of Public Health 28 Health Objectives for Iowa and the Nation The Healthy People 2020 objectives for the nation to be achieved on weight call for increasing the prevalence of healthy weight (neither overweight nor obese) to 33.9 percent among adults age 20 years and older. Iowa is well below this target , having 28.6 percent at healthy weight. The Healthy People 2020 goal for obesity is 30.6 percent. Iowa has a prevalence of 33.2 percent for those over age 20. This does not reach the HP 2020 target. The Healthy Iowans goal for obesity is 27 percent. Iowa' s figure of 32 percent for all adults fails to achieve this goal. References 1.

Diabetes Background Diabetes mellitus is a group of diseases characterized by high levels of blood glucose resulting from defects in insulin production, insulin action, or both. The most common type is type 2 diabetes , which is when the body does not use insulin properly, a c ondition known as insulin resistance ( American Diabetes Association , 2017). The rate of new cases of diagnosed diabetes in the United States has begun to fall, but the numbers are still very high (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2016) . More tha n 29 million people have diabetes and 86 million have pre -diabetes . Pre-diabetes often develops into full diabetes. Diabetes may affect persons of all ages, although prevalence increases with age. Skyrocketing costs accompany this epidemic with an estimated total annual cost (direct and indirect) in 2012 of $245 billion. This figure represents a 41 percent increase over a five year period. This includes direct medical costs of $176 billion and indir ect costs resulting from increased absenteeism, reduced productivity, disease -related unemployment disability and loss of productive capacity due to early mortality of another $69 billion. People with diagnosed diabetes, on average, have medical expenditur es that are approximately 2.3 times higher than the expenditures would be in the absence of diabetes. Approximately one in five health care dollars is attributed to diabetes (American Diabetes Association , 2013). The good news is that research studies hav e found that positive lifestyle changes can prevent or delay the onset of type 2 diabetes among high -risk adults. Lifestyle interventions include diet modification, weight loss and moderate -intensity physical activity (such as walking for two and one -half hours each week). The complications of diabetes are many and severe. Diabetes is the seventh leading cause of death in the United States and this may underestimate it , since conditions caused by diabetes are sometimes considered the underlying cause. They can include heart disease, stroke, high blood pressure, kidney disease, blindness, diseases of the nervous system, dental disease, complications of pregnan cy, lower extremity amputations and lower resistance to other diseases. However, complications can be minimized when diabetes is diagnosed early and patient s are taught to self -manage their disease through blood glucose control, weight control, taking medications appropriately, decreasing unhea lthy lifestyles such as smoking and implementing healthy lifes tyle interventions (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , 2016) . The Diabetes Prevention and Control Program at the Iowa Department of Public Health acts as a resource for health care professionals regarding the latest guidelines for diabetes care, c oordinates a statewide diabetes network and collaborates with local community projects to develop initiatives on public awareness, prevention and other areas of disease management. It also certifies programs for Medicaid reimbursement and assists certified programs in maintaining quality standards for outpatient education. Diabetes Results In 2016, 9.3 percent of respondents had ever been told by a physician that they have diabetes, excluding women told only during pregnancy. This is somewhat higher than the figure in 2015 , when 8.8 percent Iowa Department of Public Health 30 of Iowans had ever been told that they have diabetes , but very similar to the level seen in 2014 (see figure 8.1). Table 8.1 shows that the rate of diabetes is much higher for Iowans who are older, lower in educ ation and have a lower household income. The demographic group with the highest percentage of diagnosed diabetics is people age 65 to 74 years (22.6%), while the group with the lowest percentage is people age 18 to 24 years (0.3%) (see table 8.1).

Respiratory Diseases Background Few things are as immediately important to life as the ability to breathe. Several respiratory diseases exist that can make breathing difficult. Two common ones are asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Asthma is a chronic, inflammatory disease of the lungs in which the airways become blocked or narrowed causing breathing difficulty. It is characterized by recurrent wheezing, breathlessness, coughing and chest tightness (National Heart Lung and Blood Institute , 2014). This chronic disease affects more than 25 million Americans of all ages. Asthma is the most common chronic disease of childhood. About seven million children in the U.S. suffer from asthma. Prevalence among adults and children has increased sharply since 1980 (Centers for Dis ease Control and Prevention , 2011) . The causes of asthma are not completely understood, but are most likely a combination of personal and environmental risk factors. Risk factors for asthma include family history of asthma and allergies, acute respiratory infections, exposure to indoor air pollution (tobacco smoke, animal dander, dust mites, cockroaches, occupational exposures to more than 250 substances), outdoor air pollution (burning leaves, p ollen, air pollutants), obesity and lack of exercise. Diet and early exposure to certain infectious agents may provide some protection. After developing asthma, a person often becomes especially sensitive to any exposures to the environmental risk factors listed (National Heart Lung and Blood Institute, 2014). Asthma is a leading cause of inpatient admission and of unscheduled emergency department and physician office visits. Many of these admissions and visits could be avoided if medical and self - management of asthma were carried out according to national guidelines. Self-management of asthma involves the use of drugs and the avoidance of known triggers. People who suffer from asthma are encouraged to develop an asthma management plan. Poor asthma control continues to be associated with increased emergency department visits, hospitalizations and medical costs. The estimated total cost of asthma to society, including medical expenses ($50.1 billion per year), loss of productivity resulting from missed school or wo rk days ($3.8 billion per year) and premature death ($2.1 billion per year) was $56 billion (2009 dollars) in 2007; a $3 billion (5.7%) increase from 2002. Medical expenses associated with asthma were $3,259 per person per year during 2002 \u20142007 (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , 2011) . Chronic Obstruct ive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) includes both chronic bronchitis and emphysema . It is one of the most common lung diseases. Chronic bronchitis is defined by a long -term cough with mucus , while e mphysema is defined by destruction of the lungs over time . Most people with COPD have a combination of both conditions (MedlinePlus, 2017) . Smoking is the leading cause of COPD. The more a person smokes, the more likely that person will develop COPD . Other cause s are exposure to secondhand smoke or air pollution. There is no cure for COPD ; however, there are many things you can do to relieve symptoms and keep the disease from getting worse. Persons with COPD must stop smoking. This is the best way to slow the Iowa Department of Public Health 33 lung damage. Medications may also be used to treat COPD symptoms. Oxygen therapy at home may be needed if a person has a low level of oxygen in their blood. Respiratory Diseases Results In 201 6, 12.1 percent of Iowans reported ever being diagnosed by a physician with asthma. Out of all adult Iowans, 7.8 percent currently had asthma and 4.1 percent formerly had asthma.* This is about the same as in 2015 when 1 2.2 percent of Iowans reported ever having and 7.6 percent reported currently having asthma . (see figure 9.1) . Figure 9.1: Current Asthma in Iowa by Year \u20142011-2016 In Iowa, more women , people with less education , and people with lower annual household incomes currently have asthma. Fewer Hispanics report having asthma. The highest current asthma prevalence was among people earning less than $15,000 per year (17.8%). The lowest prevalence was among Hispanics (4.7%) , although due to small numbers this is not statistically significant. Also showing low prevalence are people earning $50,000 to $75,000 per year (4.8%) (see table 9.1). Starting in 2006 , the BRFSS has collected a considerable amount of information from th e people who reported they or their children had ever had asthma in a special callback survey. The data from that survey is not included in this report, but may be presented separately. When asked if they had been told they had COPD, 5.4 percent said they had. This is slightly lower than in 2015 when it was 5.7 percent. COPD was more common among women, older people, people with less education, and people with lower household income. Hispanics were less likely to report COPD (see Table 9.2). The highest pre valence of having COPD was found among those with annual household incomes less than $15,000 (14.6%). People age 18 to 24 years reported the lowest prevalence of COPD (1.1%). * For some who had ever had asthma, their current status could not be determined. 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 8.3 8.1 7.8 8.5 7.6 7.80123456789Percent Year Iowa Department of Public Health 34 Table 9.1: Iowans Currently and Formerly Having Asthma, 2016 DEMOGRAPHIC GROUPS Current Asthma Former Asthma % C.I.

Cardiovascular Diseases Background Cardiovascular disease (CVD) refers in principle to any or all of the many disorders that can affect the circulatory system. CVD most often means heart disease, heart failure or stroke ; taken together, these are the circulatory system disorders of greatest public health concern in the United States today. Heart disease includes coronary heart disease (CHD) or heart attack , also known as myocardial infarction (MI). Stroke refers to a sudden impairment of brain function, sometimes termed \"brain attack ,\" which results from interruption of circulation to one or another part of the brain. Heart disease and stroke are mainly consequences of clogged arteries (atherosclerosis) and high blood pressure (hypertension). Heart disease and stroke are the most common cardiovascular dise ases. Although the death rate from these diseases has fallen in the past few years, heart disease and stroke are still leading causes of death in the United States, accounting for nearly one-third of all annual deaths (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , 2013) . Deaths are only part of the picture. More than 80 million Americans currently live with a cardiovascular disease. For example, coronary heart disease is a leading cause of premature, permanent disability in the U.S. workforce. Stroke alo ne accounts for disability in nearly 1 million Americans. Each year, 15 to 30 percent of stroke survivors are permanently disabled. For example, suffering a stroke may lead to paralysis, speech difficulties and emotional problems. Following a heart attack, individuals frequently suffer fatigue and depression and they may find it more difficult to engage in physical activities. More than seven million hospitalizations each year are because of cardiovascular disease (Go et al, 2013). The economic impact of ca rdiovascular disease on our nation's health care system continues to grow as the population ages. About one in six health care dollars is devoted to cardiovascular disease. Heart disease and stroke cost the nation an estimated $316.6 billion in health care costs and lost productivity in 2011 \u2014and these costs are rising (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2013) . On a personal level, families who experience heart disease or stroke not only have to deal with medical bills , but also lost wages and the r eal potential of a decreased standard of living. In Iowa, heart disease is the number one cause and stroke is the sixth leading cause of death. Even so, the death rate from these causes has steadily declined. The rate per 100,000 population has gone from 363.9 in 1994 to 215 in 2015 for heart disease. The rate of deaths from stroke has gone from 82.9 in 1994 to 44.7 in 2015 ( Iowa Department of Public Health , 2017) . These decreases are mostly a result of emergency response, medicines, surgical procedures and improved systems of care after an acute event. At the same time mortality has declined, the BRFSS is documenting noteworthy increases in many risk factors that lead to heart disease and stroke. Reducing cardiovascular disease risk requires an integrated s trategy that includes: 1) Lifestyle behavior change - weight management; increased physical activity; no tobacco use; a low fat, low -cholesterol diet with moderate sodium, sugar and alcohol intake; and control of high blood cholesterol, elevated blood press ure and diabetes. Iowa Department of Public Health 38 2) Community environmental support such as population screening to identify individuals with high levels of blood cholesterol, blood pressure, blood glucose and other individuals at risk for heart disease. Community support also includes i nterventions that teach the skills necessary for behavior change that make living a healthier life easier. One popular example is the establishment and upkeep of bicycle trails for use by the public. 3) Development of public policies that encourage healthy lifestyle behaviors. These may be implemented in the form of laws, regulations, standards or guidelines that contribute to setting these and other social and environmental conditions. For example, dietary patterns result from the influences of food produc tion policies, marketing practices, product availability, cost, convenience, knowledge and choices that affect health , and preferences that are often based on early -life habits. Cardiovascular Disease Results In 2016, 4.3 percent of adult Iowans had been told by a doctor that they had had a heart attack or myocardial infarction; 3.9 percent had been told they had coronary heart disease or angina and 3.1 percent had been told they had a stroke. Although these values may seem small, they represent around 90 ,000 Iowans with a heart attack or heart disease , and 60,000 with a stroke. About 8.3 percent of Iowans reported being told they had any of the three conditions. Table 10.1 shows the distribution of these conditions by demographic groups. Myocardial infar ction and coronary heart disease/angina are combined when looking at the influence of various demographic factors. More people experienced heart -related conditions if they were men, older people, people with lower education, people with lower household inc omes or non-Hispanics. Age is the variable with the most impact on having had these conditions. Less than 2 percent of those under age 45 reported a heart condition, while 21.4 percent of those 75 years or older reported a heart condition and 27.2 percent reported any of the three cardiovascular conditions. The pattern was much the same for those who said they had a stroke with respect to age, education and income. There was no sex difference for reported strokes, however. These results represent those who have survived these cardiovascular events and they may not match the actual prevalence of these conditions. Events ending in death on their first occurrence could not be considered here. Mortality data is required to complement the information from this su rvey. References 1.

Tobacco Use Background Tobacco use remains the leading preventable cause of premature death in the United States. An estimated 46 million American adults currently smoke cigarettes , and, cigarette smoking causes more than 4 80,000 deaths each year, or one in every five deaths (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , 2017) . The estimated economic costs attributable to smok ing and exposure to tobacco smoke continue to increase and now approach $300 billion annually, with direct medical costs of at least $130 billion and product ivity losses of more than $150 billion a year (U. S. Department of Health and Human Services , 2014) . Tobacco use is known to cause heart disease, stroke, p eripheral vascular disease and respiratory diseases such as COPD and asthma attacks, as well as canc ers of the lung, larynx, esophagus, pharynx, mouth, bladder, pancreas, kidney and cervix. In fact, smoking causes diseases in nearly every organ of the body ( Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , 2017) . Consequences of smoking during pregnancy includ e spontaneous abo rtions, low birth weight babies and sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). Secondhand smoke (SHS) increases the risk of heart disease and lung cancer in adults. SHS also affects children by increasing lower respiratory tract infections and a sthma , and by decreasing pulmonary function. According to the Surgeon General , there is no safe level of exposure to secondhand smoke ( U. S. Department of Health and Human Services , 2006 ). Public health efforts to reduce the prevalence of tobacco use began after the health risks were announced in the first Surgeon General's report on tobacco in 1964. Many steps are being taken to prevent use of tobacco. Some of these include reducing exposure to environmental tobacco smoke, smoking prevention education, the restriction of minors' access to tobacco, the treatment of nicotine addiction (cessation) and working toward changing social norms and environments that support tobacco use. The last component involves counter -advertising and promotion, product regulat ion and economic incentives against tobacco. There is also support for smoking cessation through such efforts as Quitline Iowa , which has offered free nicotine replacement therapy (NRT). The legal environment has recently made it much more difficult to con tinue smoking. In March of 2007, the Iowa state legislature passed a one dollar increase in the tax on a pack of cigarettes. In the end, this should further reduce the number of smokers by inducing people to try to quit and by making it less likely that ne w people will start. On July 1 , 2008 , a smoking ban in most public places in the state took effect. This not only made it more difficult for smokers to find a place to smoke, but was quite beneficial at reducing exposure to secondhand smoke. These legal changes have spurred a host of new smokeless tobacco products such as electronic or \"e- cigarettes ,\" and smokeless tobacco in novel forms. The impact of these is just beginning to be studied. Iowa Department of Public Health 41 Tobacco Use Results Current smoking was defined as smoking at least 100 cigarettes in a lifetime and smoking every day or some days during the past 30 days. Among adult Iowans in 2016, 16.7 percent reported being a current smoker. This is a decrease from the 18.1 percent found in 2015 and is the lowest ever seen in the state (see figure 11.1). The proportion of current smokers was higher for males than for femal es, people with less education and lower household income. Black non -Hispanics had a higher percent of current smokers, while Hispanics had a lower percentage . Smoking declined with increasing age after age 65 , but was also lower for people age 18 to 24 than older age groups. Respondents with household incomes less than $15,000 reported the highest proportion of current smokers (33%). Only 4.2 percent of respon dents age 75 years and older were current smokers (see table 11.1). Figure 1 1.1: Current S moking in Iowa by Year \u20142011 -2016 About 25.3 percent of respondents were former smokers. This means that they had smoked at least 100 cigarettes in their lifetime, but did not smoke now. While more males were former smokers than females, the percent of former smokers steadily increased with age. The 18 to 24 -year age group had only 4.8 percent former smokers, while th ose 65 and older had over 42 percent (see table 11.1 and figure 11.2 ). Black/non -Hispanics had a lower percent of former smokers than other race/ethnicity groups. When former smokers were asked how long it had been since they last smoked cigarettes regularly, the majority (5 8.7%) said ten or more years. When asked about attempts to quit smoking, 5 2.5 percent of current Iowa smokers reported they quit smoking for a day or more during th e past year. Younger smokers were more likely to try to quit, as were people with the least education and income . People with the highest education and income actually had a lower percent making quit attempts. 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 Current Smoker 20.4 18.1 19.5 18.5 18.1 16.7036912151821Percent Year Iowa Department of Public Health 42 Table 11.1: Percentage of Current and Former Smokers in Iowa, 2016 DEMOGRAPHIC Current Smoker Former Smoker GROUPS % C.I.

Only 4. 7 percent said they used every day or some days. E-cigarettes had been used by 19.2 percent of Iowans , with 22.5 percent of those now using everyday or some days. This meant that in 2016 , 4.3 percent of all Iowa adults currently used e -cigarettes. Use of e - cigarettes is particularly common among the young, less educ ated, lower income and males (see table 11.2). Iowa Department of Public Health 43 Of all Iowans , 13 percent had tried smoking a hookah. Other tobacco products used every day or some days by Iowans were cigars (1. 3%) and a pipe (0. 7%). Figure 11.2 : Percentage of Current and Former Smokers by Age, 2016 Of smokers who had seen a doctor in the past year, 6 9.1 percent of them reported that the doctor had advised them to quit smoking. The most common forms of assistance offered by doctors were medical resources (2 4.4%) or a quitline (2 5%). Of smokers who had seen a dentist in the past year , 39.6 percent reported that the d entist had advised them to quit smoking. With respect to rules against smoking in their house, 85.4 percent of Iowans said they never allowed it. Further data on tobacco use will be available in separate reports. Comparison with Other States In all the states and District of Columbia, smoking prevalence ranged from a low of 8.8 percent to a high of 24.8 percent. Iowa's current smoking prevalence of 16.7 percent was slightly better than the median of 17.1 percent for all s tates. Both Iowa and the nation as a whole showed a decline in smoking prevalence from the previous year. Health Objectives for Iowa and the Nation The goal for Healthy People 2020 is to reduce the percentage of smokers to 12 percent, while the goal for Healthy Iowans is 15 percent. The prevalence of those reporting currently smoking is 16.7 percent in Iowa , which is higher than both goals. 05101520253035404550 18 - 24 25 - 34 35 - 44 45 - 54 55 - 64 65 - 74 75+Percent Age Group Current Smoker Former Smoker Iowa Department of Public Health 44 Table 11.2 : Percentage of Current E-cigarette Users in Iowa, 2016 DEMOGRAPHIC Current User GROUPS % C.I.

Iowa's prevalence of such use is 4. 7 percent. There is a need for improvement in this area. Iowa fell far short of the Healthy People 2020 goal of 80 percent of current smokers attempt ing to quit in the past year. At 52.5 percent , the rate falls nearly 30 percentage points short of the goal. Iowa also missed the Healthy People 2020 goal for recent smoking cessation success by adult smokers. 4.7 percent of former smokers said they had not smoked regularly for six months to a year, while the goal was 8 percent.

Alcohol Consumptio n Background Consumption of alcohol is a very widespread practice in our societ y; however, a large number of people get into serious trouble because of their consumption of alcohol. Alcohol consumed on an occasional basis will pose little risk to most people , and may even promote health. Even at this level, factors such as family history, health condition and use of medications can mean a person should not drink at all. Furthermore, many people find it impossible to consume alcohol in a controlled manner. Several million adults engage in risky drinking that could lead to alcohol problems. These patterns include binge drinking (drinking too much at one time) and chronic heavy drinking (drinking a large quantity of alcohol on a regular basis) ( Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , 2016). Alcohol dependency and abuse are major public health problems carrying a large economic cost and placing heavy demands on the health care system. In fact, excessive alcohol use is the third leading lifestyle -related cause of death for people in the United States each year. Excessive drinking cost the US $249 billion in 20 10 (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , 2016) . Chronic alcohol use affects every organ and system of the body. It can lead to medical disorders (e.g., fetal alcohol syndrome, liver disease, cardiomyopathy and pancreatitis). Heavy drinking can increase the risk for certai n cancers. Drinking increases the risk of death from automobile crashes as well as recreational and on -the-job injuries. Furthermore, both homicides and suicides are more likely to be committed by persons who have been drinking ( Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2016). Binge drinking is a serious problem. It has been a particularly serious problem on college campuses. Students who binge drink are more likely to damage property, have trouble with authorities, miss classes, have hangovers and experi ence injuries than those who do not. Among men, research indicates that greater alcohol use is related to greater sexual aggression. Binge drinkers appear to engage in more unplanned sexual activity and to abandon safe sex techniques more often than stude nts who do not binge ( National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism , 2016). Several groups and techniques exist to help people control their problem drinking. Although it can be difficult, it is possible to solve a drinking problem before it causes s erious damage. Alcohol Consumption Results In the BRFSS survey, a standard drink is defined as one 12 -ounce beer, one 5 -ounce glass of wine, or a drink with one shot of hard liquor. In 2016, 59.2 percent of Iowans reported that th ey had at least one drink of alcohol in the past 30 days. On the days when they drank, 35.8 percent had an average of only one drink. The median was two drinks. About 11.9 percent reported drinking five or more drinks per day on the average.

According to this definition, 6.9 percent of all Iowans were heavy drinkers. This is more than in 2015 , when 5.9 percent were heavy drinkers (see f igure 12.1). In spite of the fact that men had to have a larger number of drinks to be considered heavy drinkers, 8.1 percent of men were considered to be heavy drinkers, while only 5.9 percent of women were considered to be heavy drinkers. Older people, r acial/ethnic minorities, people with le ss than a high school education and people with household incomes $50,000 to $75,000 and less than $15,000 reported a lower prevalence of heavy drinking (see table 12.1). Figure 1 2.1: Binge and Heavy Drinkers by year, 2011 -2016 The definition of binge drinking is when a man drinks more than five drinks or a woman drinks more than four drinks on one occasion. Among all adult Iowans, 21.2 percent reported at least one binge episode in the last 30 days. This is highe r than in 2015 when it was 19.8 percent but is about the same as that seen in 2014 (see figure 12.1). Even with the lessened requirement on females, almost twice as many males binge than females (27.1 % versus 15.4 %). Men binged more than women at all age s (see figure 12.2). Age made the most difference with people of younger age binging more. The likelihood of binging decreases with age from 34.9 percent for 25 to 34 -year -olds to only 2 percent for those 75 years old and older. A higher percent of non -Hispanic Whites binge than do racial and ethnic minorities. Unlike most risky behaviors , people with more education and higher income were more likely to engage in binge drinking (see table 12.2). Comparison with Other States The prevalence of people reporting heavy drinking in the 50 states and District of Columbia range d from 3.5 percent to 11.1 percent . Iowa's figure of 6.9 percent is greater than the median of 6.5 percent. For binge drinking, the range is from a low of 11.3 percent to a high of 2 5.5 percent , with a median of 16.9 percent. Iowa's figure of 21.2 percent is well above the median. There are only four states with a higher prevalence of reported binge drinking. 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 Binge 23.1 21.7 21.7 21.4 19.8 21.2 Heavy 8.1 6.2 6.5 6.3 5.9 6.90510152025Percent YearBinge Heavy Iowa Department of Public Health 49 Health Objectives for Iowa and the Nation The Healthy People 20 20 goal for the nation for binge drinking is 24.3 percent.

Breast and Cervical Cancer Screening Breast Cancer Screening Background Breast cancer is a malignant (cancerous) tumor that starts from cells of the breast. The disease occurs mostly in women, but men can get breast cancer as well (American Cancer Society, 2016). Other than skin cancer, breast cancer is the most common cancer among women. After lung cancer, it is the second leading cause of cancer death in women. About 252,710 women in the United States are predicted to be found to have invasive breast cancer in 20 17. About 40 ,610 women will die from the disease this year. Breast cancer death rates have been going do wn. This is probably the result of finding the cancer earlier and improved treatment. Currently, there are more than 3.1 million women living in the U.S. who have been treated for breast cancer (American Cancer Society, 2016). In Iowa, 386 women died from breast cancer in 2015 ( Iowa Department of Public Health, 2017) . There are many factors that increase the risk of breast cancer. The chance of getting breast cancer increases as a woman gets older (American Cancer Society, 2014 ). Individual factors other t han age that increase the risk for developing breast cancer include family history, a personal history of breast cancer, possession of certain genes (BRCA1 or BRCA2), race, earlier abnormal breast biopsy, a long menstrual history, obesity after menopause, recent use of oral contraceptives, postmenopausal hormone therapy, never having children or having a first child after age 30, consuming one or more alcoholic beverages per day and lack of exercise (American Cancer Society, 2016). However, many women deve lop breast cancer without having any of the usual known risk factors. Early detection of breast cancer is key to surviving the disease and regular screening is key to detecting the disease early. There may be no detectable symptoms apart from screening unt il the disease is quite advanced. The chief method for early detection of breast cancer is mammography. Mammography involves an x - ray examination of the breast and can detect abnormalities in the breast before they can be felt. Because the risk of developi ng breast cancer increases as women get older, mammography, with its increased sensitivity, is recommended for older women. There has lately been some disagreement about mammography recommendations. Two agencies making recommendations are the American Canc er Society and the Preventive Services Task Force. Despite differences on exactly when to start and how often mammography screening should occur, the following are generally suggested: Older women, age 40 or 50 years and older, should be screened every one to two years with mammography. Women at higher than average risk of breast cancer should seek expert medical advice about whether they should begin screening before age 40 and the frequency of screening ( National Cancer Institute, 2016) . Women at higher t han average risk of breast cancer should also be screened with magnetic resonance imagery (MRI). Most cancer organizations also believe that adult women should have a clinical breast exam (CBE) by a health care provider as part of regular, routine care. Iowa Department of Public Health 51 Although no screening method is foolproof, there is no doubt that screening for breast cancer saves lives. Breast Cancer Screening Results In 2016, w hen asked if they had ever had a mammogram, 9 2 percent of all female Iowa ns ages 40 and older reported ha ving one. Women in their 40s were less likely to have a mammogram than older ones. In addition , women with higher household income were more likely to have a mammogram. Women with less than a high school education were less likely to have one (see table 13 .1). Table 1 3.1: Use of Mammography by Iowa Women, 2016 DEMOGRAPHIC GROUPS Ever had a Mammogram Had Mammogram in Last 2 Years Age 40 and over % C.I. (95%) Hispanic 83.5 74 had a mammogram in the past two years, 72.2 percent of all Iowa women over age 40 said they had. For women between age 50 and 75, the figure was 77.6 percent. Older women (until age 75), women with a higher education level and those with a higher household income tended to have higher percentages of having a mammogram in the past two years (see table 13.1). Iowa Department of Public Health 52 Comparison with Other States In all states and the District of Columbi a, the percent of women age 40 and older who have had a mammogram in the past two years range d from 59.7 percent to 80.9 percent. Iowa's figure of 72.2 percent is almost identical to the median of 72.5 percent. Health Objectives for Iowa and the Nation The national health objectives for Healthy People 2020 include an increase to at least 81.1 percent of women age 50 to 75 who have had a mammogram within the preceding two years. Iowa falls short of this goal with 7 7.6 percent. The Healthy Iowans goal is 88 percent for women 50 years and older. Iowa falls short here as well with 74.8 percent. Cervical Cancer Screening Background Cancer of the cervix begins in the lining of the cervix , the lower part of the uterus (womb) . This cancer does not form suddenly. First, some cells begin to change from normal to pre -cancer and then to cancer. This can take a number of years, although sometimes it happens more quickly. These changes may go away without any treatment. More often, they need to be treated to k eep them from changing into true canc er (American Cancer Society, 2017). Approximately 12,820 new cases of invasive cervical cancer and 4,210 cervical cancer -related deaths were projected to occur in the United States (American Cancer Society, 2017). Overa ll rates of U .S. women diagnosed with invasive cervical cancer have declined greatly in the last few decades. Although there are several risk factors for cervical cancer, the most important risk factor is infection with the human papilloma virus (HPV). Thi s virus is often, though not always, transmitted sexually. A vaccine now exists for HPV. Not all women infected with HPV get cervical cancer. Some other risk factors that may play a role are smoking, HIV infection, chl amydia infection and obesity (American Cancer Society, 2014). The principal screening test for cervical cancer is the Papanicolaou (Pap) test. This test allows the cellular changes in the cervix to be detected when they are precancerous or at an early stage. Early detection through Pap tests c an dramatically lower the incidence of invasive disease and can nearly eliminate deaths from cervical cancer. The American Cancer Society recommends Pap tests begin no later than age 21 years. The test should be done every three year s until age 30. It co uld be done every three years after that or every five years when combined with an HPV test. If the woman is at high risk , the test needs to be done more frequently. Women are at high risk of cervical cancer if, among other things , they have a weak immune system from HIV infection, organ tr ansplant, long -term steroid use or because they were exposed to the drug DES when their mothers were pregnant with them. Pap tests are not necessary for women who have had a total hysterectomy that was not due to cancer or are over age 65 and not high risk (American Cancer Society,2017). However, w omen who have been vaccinated against HPV should still follow these guidelines. Iowa Department of Public Health 53 Table 1 3.2: Proportion of Iowa Women Having Pap Test, 20 16 DEMOGRAPHIC GROUPS Ever had a Pap te st Had Pap test in last 3 years Age 21 - 65 % C.I. (95%) Other States In all states and the District of Columbia, the percent of women age 21 to 65 who have had a Pap test in the past three years ranged from 73.2 percent to 85.7 percent. The median was 80.2 percent. Iowa's figure of 81.6 percent is better than the median for the nation. Iowa Department of Public Health 54 Health Objectives for Iowa and the Nation For Healthy People 2020 , the goal for the proportion of women over the age of 18 who have had a Pap test in the last three years is 93 percent. For Healthy Iowans , the goal for those over age 21 years is 92 percent. The figure for 2014 of 75.8 percent over 18 and 79.3 percent ove r 21 years falls short of both of these goals. References 1.

Colorectal cancer occurs in the colon or rectum. It may also be referred to as colon cancer. The colon is the large intestine or large bowel. The rectum is the passageway that connects the colon to the anus (American Cancer Society, 2017) . Colorectal cancer usually develops from abnormal growths known as precancerous polyps in the colon and rectum. In the early stages, there are often no symptoms. Some screening tests can detect polyps so they can be removed before they turn into cancer (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2017) . An estimated 95,520 new cases of colon and 39,910 new cases of rectal cancer are expected to exist in the United States in 201 7 (American Cancer Society, 2017) . There are estimated to be 50,260 deaths from this disease ( American Cancer Society, 2017). Incidence and mortality rates have been decreasing for most of the last two decades. The decline has been steeper in the most recen t time period, partly due to an increase in screening, which can result in the detection and removal of colorectal polyps before they progress to cancer. Although the exact causes of colorectal cancer are unknown, risk factors include: Age - Approximately 93 percent of colorectal cancer cases occur in people age 50 and older and the risk of developing the disease increases with age. Family History -Those who have family members diagnosed with colorectal cancer or pre-cancerous polyps are at high risk for t he disease. Personal History - Persons who have inflammatory bowel diseases are at increased risk. Modifiable risk factors include smoking, heavy alcohol use, o besity, a diet high in red meat and physical inactivity. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (2017) recommends that men and women who are not at a high risk begin regular screening for colorectal cancer at age 50. If every one ages 50 to 75 had regular screening , as many as 60 percent of deaths from colorectal cancer could be prevented. Recom mended options include the following: Annual screening with high -sensitivity fecal occult blood testing (FOBT) Sigmoidoscopy every five years, with high -sensitivity fecal occult blood testing every three years Screening colonoscopy every 10 years . The col onoscopy has the advantage over the other tests because it can remove polyps as well as detect them. The FOBT has the advantage that it is simplest and least expensive to use, but it cannot find or remove pre-cancerous polyps. Colorectal Cancer Screening R esults In 201 6, 31.4 percent of Iowans 50 years or older reported ever using a home blood -stool testing kit (FOBT). Of those who had ever had the test, 33.6 percent had it within the past two years. Iowa Department of Public Health 56 In 201 6, 72.5 percent of Iowans 50 years or older reported ever having a sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy screening test. This is an increase from 71.2 percent found in 2014. Respondents with more education and a higher annual household income were more likely to have the test. Having a colonoscopy was far more common than having a sigmoidoscopy (9 7.9 percent compared to only 2.1 percent for sigmoidoscopy). Nearly everyone who had one of these tests ha d a colonoscopy. To determine the percentage of Iowans being adequately screened , the percent of respondents who had either screening method within the proper time interval was calculated for individuals with normal screening results . The result was that 6 8.6 percent of Iowans 50 to 75 years old had, at least, one of the colorectal screening methods within the prescribed time . This is about the same as the 68 percent that was reported in 2014. Respondents from households earning less than $15,00 0 had the lowest percentage ( 55.6 %), while college graduates had the highest ( 76.1 %) (see table 1 4.1). Table 14.1: Prevalence of Colorectal Cancer screening in I owans Meeting Recommendations, 2016 DEMOGRAPHIC GROUPS Met Screening Criteria from any Method % C.I. (95%) TOTAL 68.6 (66.6 2004, a number of additional questions have been included in the survey concerning colorectal cancer screening. A few findi ngs from these are given here. Iowans 50 years and older reported that 62 percent of them had been talked to by a health care p rofessional about colorectal cancer screening. When the health care professional talked about screening, 90.8 percent recommended having a sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy. Of the respondents who had a test recommended, 82.4 percent then had the test. Comparis on with Other States The proportion of people in all states and the District of Columbia who have received the adequate level of colorectal cancer screening ranges from 58.8 percent to 76.3 percent. Iowa's prevalence of 68.6 percent is slightly better tha n the median of 67.7 percent. Health Objectives for Iowa and the Nation The Healthy People 2020 and Healthy Iowans goals are for 70 percent of people age 50 to 75 to be screened according to the latest guidelines. Iowa's figure of 68.6 percent does not quite reach these goals. References 1. American Cancer Society. Colorectal Cancer Overview, Atlanta, Georgia: American Cancer Society, 2017.

Other Cancer prevalence and screening Background Cancer is a very common condition and the second most common cause of death in The United States. Cancer occurs when a group of cells grows out of control and has the ability to invade normal tissue (American Cancer Society, 2015) . Cancer may arise almost anywhere in the body, though some locations are more common than others are . Skin cancer is a very common form of cancer. Other common types are lung, breast, prostate and colon cancer. For the past 40 years we have been fighting \"a war on cancer .\" While cancer is still a very common disease, more people are surviving cancer. Overall, the American Cancer Society predicted In 2015, there would be an estimated 1,658,370 new cancer cases diagnosed and 589,430 cancer deaths in the U.S. (American Cancer Society , 2015b ). However, death rates for all cancer types fell by 1.9 percent a year from 2001 to 2007 in men and by 1.5 percent a year in women from 2002 through 2007 (Reuters, 2011). Steady overall declines in cancer death rates have meant about 898,000 who would have died prematurely from cancer in the past 17 years did not. Other Cancer prevalence and screening Results In 2016, 5.6 percent of Iowans had ever been told they had skin cancer, while 7.1 percent reported having been tol d they had some other type of cancer. This is a decline from 2015 in reported skin cancer , when 6.4 percent of Iowans reported having had it. The prevalence reporting having been told they had some other type of cancer was essentially unchanged. Skin cance r behaves somewhat differently from other types of cancers, which themselves may vary in prevalence and prognosis according to type. Most cancers, however, are more common with age. Skin cancer is more common among white non -Hispanics. Other cancers, on th e other hand, were more common among females and lower income and education. Other cancers were only less common for Hispanics, rather than all non -Whites. The highest prevalence of ever having cancer was for people age 75 and over. In this age group , the prevalence was 21.5 percent for skin cancer and 21.8 percent for other cancers. Black/non -Hispanics and Hispanics as well as those age 18 to 44 years had a skin cancer prevalence of less than 2 percent, while for other cancers only people age 18 to 44 ye ars had as low a prevalence (see table 15.1). Another type of cancer screening that was asked about was prostate cancer. Screening for this cancer has been controversial since there are many false positive outcomes that can lead to unnecessary treatment. For Iowa men age 40 and older , a doctor or health professional had talked to 57 percent about the advantages of a prostate specific antigen (PSA) screening test, while only 22.4 percent had been talked to about the disadvantages. The test was recommended by 48.2 percent of the doctors and 88.5 percent of those for whom it was recommended had the test.

Disability Background The World Health Organization's International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) (World Health Organization , 2001 ) defines disability as an umbrella term for impairments, activity limitations and participation restrictions. Disability is the interaction between individuals with a health condition (e.g. , cerebral palsy, Down's syndrome and depression) and personal and environmental factors (e.g. , negative attitu des, inaccessible transportation and public buildings, and limited social supports). Impairment is defined as \"any loss or abnormality of psychological, physiological or anatomical structure or function. \" Chronic physical, mental and emotional conditions can limit the ability of adults to carry out important activities such as working and doing everyday household chores. With advancing age, an increasing percentage of adults experience limitation of activity (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , 2016). The latest available census estimates for 2011 found that nearly 57 million people in the United States (nearly 20 percent ) had a disability that prevented or limited their ability in some way ( U. S. Bureau of the Census , 2013). Disability may not only be considered a health condition. It may also be seen as a demographic condition that affects health. This source of health disparities may arise due to difficulties with health access faced by people with disabilities de riving from physical, financial or social sources. Special considerations need to be made for people with disabilities to participate in the health care system on an equal basis with the non -disabled ( World Health Organization , 2015). Having a disability does not necessarily need to be a barrier to good general health in unrelated areas. Many disabled Americans use Assistive Technology Devices (ATDs) to accommodate mobility impairments and other sensory and mental impairments. These can allow a person with a disability to work and otherwise live an independent life. Disability Results In 2016 , disability is being determined by two different methods. The first \"classic\" method uses the questions about being limited and the use of special equipment, which have been in the survey for many years. Whether someone is considered to have a disability in this analysis is based on a positive response to either of these two questions. In 2016 , 19.1 percent of Iowans responded \"yes\" to being limited in any way in a ctivities due to an impairment or health problem. When asked whether they had a health problem requiring the use of special equipment, 7.4 percent of adult Iowans said they needed such items as a cane, a wheelchair, a special bed or a special telephone. A ccording to the \"classic\" method, 21.3 percent of Iowans were considered to have a disability. This compares to 20.6 percent in 2015 , but is nearly identical to that found in 2014 (see figure 16.1). Iowa Department of Public Health 61 Figure 16.1: People with Disability in Iowa Trend, 2011 -2016 Classic Method Recently, six functional questions have been added to the BRFSS. The \" new\" method of determining disability requires a \"yes\" response to any of these six questions. In 2016, 6.5 percent of Iowans said they were deaf or had troub le hearing; 2.5 percent said they were blind; 9.4 percent said they had serious difficulty concentrating, remembering or making decisions ; 11.4 percent said they had serious difficulty walking or climbing stairs ; 3.2 percent said they had difficulty dressi ng or bathing ; and 5 percent said they had difficulty doing errands alone such as visiting a doctor's office or shopping because of a physical, mental or emotional condition. Using the answers to these questions, the \"new\" method for determining disability produced 22.5 percent. Table 16.1 shows the results of both disability determination methods. Although the values differ somewhat, the pattern of relationship to the demographic variables are similar. Females, older people, people with less education, and people with lower household incomes reported higher percentages of disability. Hispanics showed a lower level of disability. Those with household incomes less than $15,000 reported the highest percentage of disability (4 3.5 percent classical , 48.4 percent new) . Many disabled people are unable to work due to their disability. The second highest reporting group was those ages 75 and over ( 39.1 percent classic, 47.3 percent new ). This group is the most rapidly growing group in the population. Arthritis is the leading cause of disability in the United States. Arthritis is the name given to a group of over 100 different rheumatic diseases and conditions that result in pain and reduction of functionality in and around the joints. The most common are osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, fibromyalgia and gout (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , 2017) . Arthritis may be caused by a wearing down of cartilage, a change in bone composition or inflammation in the joints. In 2016, a doctor h ad told 25.5 percent of Iowans that they had some form of arthritis. This is slightly less than in 2015 (see figure 16.2). Since the percent reporting arthritis is higher than the percent reporting disability, not all people diagnosed with arthritis find it to be a limitation. 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 Disabled 21.7 20.4 20.9 21.5 20.6 21.30246810121416182022Percent Year Iowa Department of Public Health 62 Table 16.1 Percent Reporting Being Disabled, 2016 Demographic Groups Classic Method New Method % C.I.

Injury Control Background The 2016 BRFSS examines three areas related to injury control. These are falls, seatbelt use and drinking and driving. Falls Unintentional falls are the leading cause of both fatal and nonfatal serious injuries among the fastest growing segment of the U.S. population, older adults. In the United States, one of every three people age 65 years and older falls each year ( Centers fo r Disease Control and Prevention , 2016). The leading injuries resulting from falls are traumatic brain injuries (TBI), hip fractures, other fractures and damage to internal organs. The direct medical costs of falls, adjusted for inflation, were $3 1 billion (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , 2016) . The financial toll for older adult falls is expected to increase as the population ages, and may reach $54.9 billion by 2020 . This projection includes indirect costs such as the costs of disabilities re sulting from falls. Elderly persons who survive a fall experience significant morbidity. Hospital stays are almost twice as long in elderly patients who are hospitalized after a fall than in elderly patients who are admitted for another reason. People age 75 and older who fall are four to five times more likely than those age 65 to 74 to be admitted to a long -term care facility for a year or longer. Compared with elderly persons who do not fall, those who fall experience greater functional decline in activi ties of daily living (ADLs) and in physical and social activities, and they are at greater risk for subsequent institutionalization (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. , 2016) . Some of this is due to a fear of falling again. Each year, 2.8 million older people are treated in emergency departments for fall injuries (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2016). In Iowa in 2015, the number of fatal falls was 547 , with 423 being among those 75 years of age or older (Iowa Department of Public Heal th, 2017). The number of people age 65 years and older is projected to double in the next 50 years. For people age 85 years and older, relative growth rates are even faster. One of the strongest predictors of a fall is having sustained a previous fall ( Ame rican Academy of Family Physicians , 2000). A fall is often a marker of increasing fragility, functional decline, or neurological impairment, and may indicate the need for a secondary prevention strategy (e.g., hip protectors to prevent hip fractures.) Falls Results The BRFSS defines a fall as when a person unintentionally comes to rest on the ground or another lower level. Respondents age 45 years and older were asked how many times they had experienced a fall in the last 12 months. In this group, 29.6 percent said they had fallen at least once . Some, 3.2 percent, reported they had fallen five or more times. Of those who had fallen, 34.4 percent said that at least one fall had injured them. Some, 1.9 percent, had been injured five or more times. In this instance, injury was defined as limiting activ ity for at least a day or causing them to see a doctor . Iowa Department of Public Health 66 Table 17.1: Prevalence of Falls in Iowa, 2016 DEMOGRAPHIC GROUPS Any Falls in Last 12 Months % C.I. (95%) TOTAL 29.6 (28.1 (23.4 -28.6) 24.0 (21.3 -26.6) Surprisingly, household income had more relationship to whether people experienced a fall than anything else. More people who were older or who had a lower level of education or a lower household income reported falls . The group reporting the highest prevalence of falls was those with an annual household income less than $15,000 (41.2%), while the group with the lowes t prevalence was those with annual household incomes of $75,000 and above (24%) (see table 17.1). Seatbelt Use In addition to being the leading cause of death among U.S. residents aged 5 -34 years, motor vehicle - occupant injuries account for approximately 15 percent of all nonfatal injuries treated in U.S. emergency departments. In 2013, t here were 30,057 passenger vehicles involved in fatal crashes. More than 2 2,300 passenger vehicle occupants lost their lives in traffic crashes in 2013. There were 1,591,0 00 crashes involving injur ies with 2,099,000 occupants injured (National Highway Traffic Safety Administration , 2015). In 2012, an estimated 2,519,471 ED visits resulted from nonfatal crash injuries, with an estimated lifetime medical cost of $18.4 billion (2012 U.S. dollars). Approximately 7.5 percent of these Iowa Department of Public Health 67 visits resulted in hospitalizations that required an estimated 1,057,465 hospital days (Bergen et al., 2014). Seatbelts save lives. Seat belts, which reduce the risk for fatal injuries from mo tor vehicle crashes by approximately 45 percent and serious injuries by approximately 50 percent, are the most effective intervention for protecting motor vehicle occupants (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , 2011) . Failure to wear a seat belt con tributes to more fatalities than any other single traffic safety -related behavior. Sixty -three percent of people killed in accidents are not wearing seat belts. Unbelted occupants were five times more likely to die when involved in a crash than belted occu pants. Wearing a seat belt is still the single most effective thing we can do to save lives and reduce injuries on America's roadways. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) estimates that in 2013, the use of seat belts in passenger veh icles saved 12,584 lives for occupants five years of age and olde r (National Highway Traffic Safety Administration , 2015) .Apart from this, seatbelt use would lead to a substantial saving in hospital costs and disability, particularly from head trauma. Seatbelt Use Results In 2016, when respondents were asked how often they wore a seatbelt when driving or riding in a car, 94.9 percent said always or nearly always. Wearing seatbelts was more common among females than males (97.1% vs. 92.7%). It also was less prevalent among those with less education (see table 17.2). Drinking and Driving An automobile crash is considered to be alcohol -related when the driver is reported to have a blood alcohol level of .08 grams per deciliter or higher. Considering that blood alcohol level may not be reported for every crash and that any amount of alcohol causes some amount of impairment, figures for its impact are conservative. Even though the number of fatalities from drunk driving has fallen by about a third over the past decade, a bout three in every ten American auto crash deaths involve alcohol . Every day, 28 people in the United States die in an alcohol -related vehicle crash \u2014that's one person every 51 minutes (National Highway Traffic Safety Administration , 2017) . About one -third of these deaths involved someone other than the driver. Alcohol -relate d crashes in the United States cost the public an estimated $ 52 billion . Even more than that cost was paid in terms of loss of quality of life. People , other than the drinking driver , paid 63 percent of the total cost of these crashes (National Highway Tra ffic Safety Administration , 2014) . Drinking and Driving Results In 2016, 6.2 percent of adult Iowans reported that within the past 30 days they had driven when they had too much to drink at least once. More men than women had reported doing this (8.7% vs. 3.4%). A larger percentage of younger people reported driving under the influence , except for the youngest group. The prevalence varied widely but unsystematically for people from different household income groups. The range was 9.7 percent for people age 25 to 34 years to 0.4 percent for those age 75 years and up (see table 17.2). Comp arison with Other States Iowa Department of Public Health 68 In all states and the District of Columbia , the range of people reporting at least one fall in the last year ranged from 23.9 percent to 39 percent with a median of 29.6 percent. Iowa was exactly on the median. In terms of seatbe lt use, the percent reporting their use always or nearly always ranged from 81.4 percent to 97.9 percent with a median of 94.3 percent. Iowa was a little better than the median with 94.9 percent. Drinking and driving at least once in the past month ranged from only 2.3 percent to 19.8 percent. The next highest was only 6.4 percent. Iowa was the third highest state in terms of driving under the influence with 6.2 percent. The median was 4 percent.

Immunization Background Influenza , or the flu , is a contagious respiratory illness caused by viruses that infect the nose, throat and lungs. It can cause mild to severe illness, and at times can lead to death. The best way to prevent the flu is by getting a flu vaccin ation each year (Centers for Disea se Control and Prevention , 2016) . Influenza can vary greatly from year to year in the severity of its impact. For instance, the usual seasonal influenza primarily was a problem for the elderly, while the recent H1N1 pandemic focused more on younger people. For healthy children and adults, influenza is typically a moderately severe illness. For unhealthy or elderly people, influenza can be very dangerous. Adults 65 years old and older who contract influenza are much more likely to have serious complications from this illness, which can affect their health and independence. Influenza can be prevented with the influenza vaccine. This vaccine is produced each year so that it can be effective against influenza viruses that are expected to cause illness that year . A yearly influenza vaccination has been reported to be between 67 percent and 92 percent effective in preventing influenza and reducing its severity. The vaccine may be taken through several methods, but the most common is a shot in the arm. The best tim e to receive the influenza vaccine is soon after the vaccine becomes available in the fall of each year. The recommend ation for annual vaccination against seasonal influenza includes almost everyone in the United States population from six months old and o lder (Grohskopf et al., 2015) . Influenza is a very serious illness for anyone at high risk. Certain diseases that place people at high risk include: Chronic lung disease such as asthma, emphysema, c hronic bronchitis, tuberculosis or cystic fibrosis; Heart or ot her chronic metabolic disorders; Severe anemia; Chronic kidney disease or Diseases or treatments that depress immunity. Some of the symptoms associated with influenza are fever, chills, coughing, weakness, muscle aches and pains, s ore throat or head ache ( Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , 2016) . Pneumonia is a lung disease caused by bacteria, viruses and other infectious agents , such as fungi. Pneumonia is frequently a complication of influenza and is responsible for the v ast majority of deaths from the two. Each year , over one million people in the U.S. are hospitalized with pneumonia and more than 50,000 people die from the disease (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , 2016) . Influenza and pneumonia combined are the eighth leading cause of death among all Americans and the seventh leading cause for people over age 65. Influenza and pneumonia together resulted in 608 deaths in Iowa in 201 5 (Iowa Department of Public Health, 201 7). The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommends that persons aged 65 years old or older receive at least one lifetime dose of pneumococcal vaccine ( Tomczyk et al. , 2014). A second vaccine is now also recommended to follow the first fo r added protection. People at higher risk should Iowa Department of Public Health 71 receive the pneumonia vaccine at age 18 and older. People at high risk includes smokers, people with respiratory problems such as asthma or COPD , and those with compromised immunity. Immunization Results In 2016, 67 percent of Iowans age 65 and over reported having a flu shot in the past 12 months. This is lower than the 70.3 percent reported in 2015 , but is about the same as reported in 2014 (see figure 18.1). Among all adults, 46.6 percent had a flu immuni zation in the past 12 months. Females, older people, people with more education, people with higher household incomes and non -Hispanic Whites were more likely to have a flu immunization. The lowest percentage was found among Non -Hispanic Blacks (31.2%), wh ile the highest was for those age 75 and older (68.7%) (see table 18.1). In 2016, 76.3 percent of Iowans age 65 and over reported ever having a pneumonia vaccination. This is slightly higher than the figure found in 2015 (75.8%). It is the highest level se en in the past six years (see figure 18.1). Among all adults, 3 4.6 percent had ever received a pneumonia vaccination. Older people were much more likely to have been vaccinated, although 18 to 24 -year -olds were more likely than the immediately older groups to do so. Men, Non -Hispanic Blacks, Hispanics, and people with higher education, or higher household income were less likely to have pneumonia vaccinations. The relation with education and income is the opposite of most health risk measures. The lowest percentage of pneumonia vaccination occurred among those who were 35 to 44 years old (11.1%), while those 75 years old and older were highest by far (81.3%) (see Table 18.1). Pneumonia vaccination did not really increase with increasing age until age 55. I t dramatically increased after age 65. Since vaccination is only recommended for those age 65 years and older except under special conditions, this is not surprising. Figure 18.1: Flu and Pneumonia Immunizations by year, 2011 -2016 Age >= 65 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 influenza 70.2 70.1 67.4 66.8 76.308162432404856647280Percent Yearinfluenza pneumonia Iowa Department of Public Health 72 Table 18.1: Percentage of influenza and Pneumonia Imm unizations in Adult Iowans, 2016 DEMOGRAPHIC GROUPS Influenza Pneumonia % (95%) TOTAL 15.3 (9.2-21.4) GROUP 18-24 (31.4 -42.0) 54.8 $75,000+ 54.9 (51.6 -58.2) 22.9 (20.5 -25.3) Those who had ever been told they had several chronic conditions that could increase the risk from flu or pneumonia were more likely to receive their flu and pneumonia vaccinations than those who had not been told they had any of these conditions. Of all r espondents ever told they had diabetes, asthma, COPD or kidney disease , 55 percent had a flu vaccination and 54.1 percent had a pneumonia vaccination. This compares with 4 4.4 percent and 29.4 percent respectively for those who did not have any of these con ditions. Iowa Department of Public Health 73 Comparison with Other States The median percentage of the population age 65 and over who have had a flu shot in the past 12 months from all the states and the District of Columbia was 58.6 percent in 201 6. The range was from 49.5 percent to 67.5 percent. The prevalence in Iowa was near the maximum at 67 percent. There was only one state with a higher rate. The median percentage of the population age 65 years old and older who ever had a pneumonia vaccination was 7 3.4 percent. The range was from 6 4.4 percent to 7 9.8 percent. Iowa's value of 7 6.3 percent is above the median. Health Objectives for Iowa and the Nation The Healthy People 2020 and Healthy Iowans , goals for having a flu shot in the past 12 months and ever having a pneumonia vaccination for people age 65 and over are both 90%. Although much higher than the nation as a whole, Iowa's 2016 figures of 67 percent for having a flu vaccination and 7 6.3 percent for ever having a pneumonia shot have a long way to go to meet these targets. The Healthy People 2020 goal for flu immunization of peop le age 18 to 64 is 80 percent. Iowa misses this by an even greater amount having an immunization prevalence of only 41.1 percent.

This is the virus that causes acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). HIV is different from most other viruses because it attacks the immune system. The immune system gives our bodies the ability to fight infections. HIV finds and destroys a type of white blood cell that the immune system must have to fight disease. AIDS is the final stage of HIV infection. It can take years for a person infected with HIV, even without treatment, to reach this stage. Having AIDS means that the virus has weakened the immune system to the point at which the body has a difficult time fi ghting infections (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , 2016) . The HIV epidemic has been with us for more than 30 years (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2011 a). Worldwide, 36.9 million persons were living with HIV infection at the end of 20 14. About 1. 1 million people in the United States are living with HIV (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , 2017) . Of those people, about one in seven do not know they are infected. Not knowin g puts them and others at risk. In 201 5, an estimated 39,513 people were diagnosed with HIV infection in the United States. The number of new HIV diagnoses fell 19 percent from 2005 to 2014. Because HIV testing has remained stable or increased in re cent years, this decrease in diagnoses suggests a true decline in new infections. The decrease may be due to targeted HIV prevention efforts ; however, progress has been uneven and diagnoses have increased among a few groups. (Centers for Disease Control an d Prevention , 2017) . Groups with the largest exposure include \"men who have sex with men ,\" injection drug use rs, African Americans and Hispanics. New diagnoses are occurring among women and people infected heterosexually. These data must be used to ensure targeted prevention efforts to reach those in greatest need, with a primary focus on young African American and Hispanic men and women at risk through sexual and drug -related behaviors. African Americans and Hispanics continue to be over -represented among persons with HIV diagnoses when compared to the sizes of their populations in Iow a; however, it is important to keep in mind that non-Hispanic whites account for 60 percent of new HIV diagnoses and 65 percent of persons living with HIV/AIDS (Iowa Department of Public Health , 2017 ). HIV/AIDS prevalence continues to increase in Iowa. As of December 31, 2016, there were 2,371 persons living with HIV or AIDS who were Iowa residents at the time of their diagnoses . There were 136 new diagnoses during 201 6, which was the highest number ever recorded. (Iowa Department of Public Health, 201 7). The lifetime costs of health care associated with HIV have grown considerably. Currently, the lifetime treatment cost of a single HIV infection is estimated at $ 379, 668 in 2010 dollars ( Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , 2017 ). CDC recommends routine HIV testing in health care settings. People need to get tested so they can get treated and not infect others. Being tested will save their lives and the lives o f other people (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , 2011) . Treatment for HIV is more effective than ever before. Iowa Department of Public Health 75 HIV/AIDS Results In 201 6, 26.8 percent of all adult Iowans reported ever being tested for HIV, not including part of a blood donation. This is a slight decrease from 2015, when 2 7.3 percent said they had been tested (see figure 19.1) . Females, minority race/ethnicity, younger people except those under 2 5 years, and those with low household incomes were more likely to be tested. The largest proportion of respondents tested was Table 19.1: Percentage of Iowans Tested for HIV/AIDS, 2016 DEMOG RAPHIC GROUPS Had HIV Test % C.I. (95%) TOTAL 26.8 (25.4 -28.2) SEX Male 24.9 (22.7 -27.1) Female 28.5 (26.3 -30.7) RACE/ETHNICITY Non -Hispanic -26.5) (48.6 (21.5 H.S. or 23.7 (21.2 -26.2) Some Post -H.S. 28.7 (26.2 -31.2) College Graduate 27.2 (24.8 -29.6) HOUSEHOLD INCOME <$15,000 38.0 -30.4) 27.4 (24.9 -29.9) among Non -Hispanic Blacks (60 .6%). The smallest proportion reporting being tested was those age 75 years and older (3.5% ) (see table 19.1). There is an interesting interaction between sex and age. Figure 19.2 shows that in younger people, many more women have b een tested, while men are more likely to be tested in the older age groups. Comparison with Other States In all states and the District of Columbia , the percentage of people who had a test for HIV ranged from 2 2.9 percent to 71.3 percent. The median perc entage of people tested was 3 5.6 percent. There were only two states with a lower percentage than Iowa's figure of 26.8 percent. Health Objectives for the Nation Healthy People 2020 has the goal of 16.9 percent of people age 1 5 to 44 being tested for HIV in the past 12 months. Iowa had a level of 9.3 percent for respondents age 18 to 44 tested within this time period . This is far below th e goal.

Iowa Department of Public Health 78 20. Oral Health Background Good overall health requires good oral health. Oral health complications not only reflect general health conditions, but also exacerbate them. Oral diseases are linked to poor pregnancy outcomes, cardiovascular disease, diabetes and respiratory disease. P oor oral health results in chronic and acute pain, loss of days from work and school, and inappropriate use of emergency rooms. Untreated oral diseases and conditions can affect the ability to eat and drink, swallow, maintain proper nutrition, smile and co mmunicate (Institute of Medicine (IOM) and National Research Council (NRC ), 2011 ). There are threats to oral health across the lifespan. Nearly one -third of all adults in the United States have untreated tooth decay. One in seven adults aged 35 to 44 year s has gum disease . In addition, nearly a quarter of all adults have experienced some facial pain in the past six months. Oral cancers are most common in older adults, particularly those over 55 years who smoke and are heavy drinkers (Centers for Disease Co ntrol and Prevention , 2013) . The baby boomer generation will be the first where the majority will maintain their natural teeth over their entire lifetime, having benefited from water fluoridation and fluoride toothpastes. Over the past 10 years, the number of adults missing all their natural teeth has declined from 31 percent to 25 percent for those aged 60 years and older, and from 9 percent to 5 percent for those adults between 40 and 59 years. However, 5 percent means a surprising one out of 20 middle -aged adults is missing all their teeth (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , 2013) . Toothaches are the most common pain of the mouth or face reported by adults. This pain can interfere with vital functions such as eating, swallowing and talking. Almos t one of every four adults reported some form of facial pain in the past six months (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , 2013) . Most adults show signs of gum disease. Severe gum disease affects about 14 percent of adults aged 45 to 54 years. This increases to one in every four adults aged 65 years and older. Signs and symptoms of soft tissue diseases such as cold sores are common in adults and affect about 19 percent of those aged 25 to 44 years (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , 2013) . Profound disparities remain that affect those without the resources to achieve good oral care or the knowledge of its importance. Over 40 percent of poor adults (20 years and older) have at least one untreated decayed tooth compared to 16 percent of non -poor adults. This fact inspired the first Surgeon General's Report on Oral Health, which identified a \"silent epidemic\" of dental and oral diseases and called for a national effort to improve Americans' oral health ( U. S. Department of Health and Human Servi ces, 2000) . Many studies document that those in poverty, racial minorities, and those in rural areas have less access to dental care. For example, poor children are more likely to have unmet dental need than children from families with higher incomes. The most commo n barriers to good oral health are a lack of dental insurance or the inability to pay for care and problems of access involving transportation and travel, as well as the need to take time off work for appointments ( U. S. Department of Health and Human Serv ices, 2000) . Iowa Department of Public Health 79 Increasing access to preventive care is an important way to improve oral health for all populations, but in particular , for the vulnerable and underserved. Many oral diseases can be prevented through a combination of behavior changes (e.g. , home care and hygiene, proper food choices, tobacco cessation) and system changes (e.g. , community water fluoridation, oral health promotion and awareness, increasing accessibility to care, and increasing the dental safety net). Oral Health Results In 201 6, 71.3 percent of Iowans surveyed reported visiting a dentist, dental hygienist or dental clinic within the past year. Females , people with higher education and greater income were more likely to report a dental visit during the past 12 months. White s and Hispanics were more likely to have a dental visit than other race and ethnic groups. Iowans with a household income of $75,000 or more had the highest proportion reporting recent dental visits (8 4.9%). At the other extreme, only 47 .5 percent of those from households earning less than $15,000 annually reported visiting a dentist in the past 12 months (see table 20.1). A majority of adult respondents (61.4%) had no permanent teeth removed due to tooth decay or gum disease. The percentage of those with perma nent teeth removed rose with increasing age, lower income, and lower education. The percentage with no permanent teeth removed was highest for those age 18 to 24 years old (89.4%). The lowest percent having all their own teeth was 75 years and older (27.1 %) (see Table 20.1). The percent of Iowans age 65 and older with all permanent teeth removed was 14.9 percent. Health Objectives for Iowa and the Nation Healthy People 2020 had a goal of 31.2 percent of Americans age 45 to 64 years having no permanent teeth extracted. Io wa far surpassed this goal with 54.7 percent having no extractions in this age group. In Healthy People 2020 the goal was 21.6 percent of people age 65 to 74 years having all permanent teeth extracted. Iowa surpassed this goal having onl y 13 percent with all permanent teeth extracted. References 1. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention . Adult Oral Health , 2013.

Iowa Department of Public Health 81 21. Mental Health and Adverse Childhood Experiences Background Mental Health and mental illness are two different things. Mental Health is a general term referring not only to the absence of mental disorder, but also to the ability of a person to successfully handle the daily challenges and social interactions of life (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , 2013) . Mental illness refers to disorders of mood, thought or behavior. Health is not merely physical health, but also mental health ; nor are these two independent of each other. Poor physical health can lead to poor mental health and poor mental health can lead to poor physical health. Depression is characterized by a state of low mood and an aversion to activity. Depression is the most common type of mental illness, affecting more than 26 percent of the U.S. adult population. It has been estimated that by the year 2020, depression will be the second leading cause of disability throughout the world, trailing only ischemic heart disease (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , 2013) . Anxiety disorders are al so common in the general population. Anxiety disorders are characterized by excessive worry about everyday events. Dementias such as Alzheimer's ha ve become an increasing problem due to the aging of the population. Dementias are characterized by increasi ng inability to remember and concentrate. The economic costs of mental illness are difficult to pin down. Serious mental illness costs America $193.2 billion in lost earnings per year (National Alliance on Mental Illness, 2017). Much of the economic burden of mental illness is not the cost of care, but the loss of income due to unemployment, expenses for social supports, and a range of indirect costs due to a chronic disability that begins early in life. Mental health and mental disorders also have a signif icant impact on the total health care system. Up to half of all visits to primary care physicians are due to conditions caused by or made worse by mental or emotional problems. Evidence has shown that mental disorders, especially depressive disorders, are strongly related to the occurrence, successful treatment, and course of many chronic diseases including diabetes, cancer, cardiovascular disease, asthma and obesity , and many risk behaviors for chronic disease , such as physical inactivity, smoking, excessi ve drinking and insufficient sleep (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , 2013) . Adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) are stressful or traumatic events, including abuse and neglect. They may also include household dysfunction , such as witnessing dome stic violence or growing up with family members who have substance use disorders. Experiences people have in early childhood can have a lifelong effect on both physical and mental health. A look at these experiences can help to focus on people likely to ne ed special attention (Anda & Felitti, 2014). Mental Health and Adverse Childhood Experiences Results When asked about various chronic conditions in 201 6, 14.8 percent of adults reported that they had ever been told they had a depressive disorder. This is significantly lower than in 201 5 when it was 1 9 Iowa Department of Public Health 82 percent. This is a major reversal of the trend from previous years , and is the lowest level found in the past six years (see figure 21.1). Figure 2 1.1: Percent of Iowans Ever Told They Had Depression by Year , 2011 - 2016 The prevalence of depression was greater among women, people with less education and lower income individuals , and less among the elderly. The highest prevalence was among those with annual household incomes less than $15,000 (3 1.6%). The lowest prevalence was among those age 75 years or more (8.2%) (see table 2 1.1). The BRFSS contained many questions in three modules to explore the early childhood experiences of the respondents. These were adverse childhood experiences (ACEs), phy sical and emotional neglect and resilience. Respondents were asked to answer questions about the time before they were 18 years old. Rather than look at each question from these modules individually, a single score was determined for each module based on a ll the responses to the questions in that module. ACEs look at a wide range of experiences from less than ideal parents such as divorced, incarcerated or drug abusing to physical, psychological or sexual abuse. This module contained 11 questions. For Iowan s, 39.8 percent indicated no adverse childhood experiences, 22.8 percent indicated one, 21.5 percent indicated two or three, 9 percent indicated four or five and 7 percent indicated six or more. The resilience and physical and emotional neglect modules bot h contained six questions. A higher score on these modules indicated a more positive experience during childhood. For resilience, each question was scored from zero to four points with four being the most positive. 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 Depression 15.2 17.0 19.2 18.7 19.0 14.8036912151821Percent Year Iowa Department of Public Health 83 Table 21.1 Prevalence of Reported Depression in Iowa, 2016 DEMOGRAPHIC GROUPS Depressive Disorder % C.I.

For physical and emotional neglect , each question was scored from zero to three points , with three being the most positive. A majority (54.3%) scored a full 18 points for the module, while nearly 2 percent scored six points or less. The number of ACE s was positively related to other physical and mental health measures. Days of bad physical health, frequent mental distress (FMD) and diagnosed depression all were related to number of ACEs reported , with the mental health measures being the most strongly rela ted (see Table 21.2). For other information related to mental health , see Chapter 4 on general health status and health -related quality of life. Health Objectives for the Nation Healthy People 2020 has a goal of 6.1 percent of people experiencing a major depression episode. The 201 6 Iowa BRFSS shows 1 4.8 percent of adult Iowans reporting ever having a depressive episode. Although it is not certain if all these would have been considered major depression, Iowa very likely exceeds the goal. References 1. Anda RF & Felitti VJ.
