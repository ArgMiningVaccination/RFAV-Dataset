Acupuncture Q & A [View our Anti-InflamMax supplement](../../contents/for-patients/supplements/anti-inflammax) [More Information on our supplements](../../contents/for-patients/supplements) What is acupuncture? Acupuncture is a very effective natural treatment for all types pain and chronic disorders. Uniquely, it leaves you feeling relaxed yet energized while eliminating your problems. How does acupuncture treatment work? The classical Chinese explanation of acupuncture starts with the idea that channels of energy run in regular patterns throughout the body and over its surface. These energy channels, called meridians, are like rivers flowing through the body to irrigate and nourish the tissues and organs. It's possible to influence these meridians by \"needling\" points on the body. That stimulates the nervous system and creates a healthy and regular flow of energy through the meridians. As a result, your body naturally corrects imbalances that have to do with digestion, nutrient absorption, and energy production. Acupuncture treatment can also release chemicals throughout the body that help to relieve pain, promote hormone balance, and trigger a natural healing response. How many treatments do patients need? The number of recommended acupuncture treatments varies from person to person. For complex or long-standing conditions, you may benefit from one or two treatments a week for several months. For acute problems, you might need fewer visits. For health maintenance, most patients can benefit from about four sessions per year. Acupuncture can be effective when it's used as a stand-alone treatment, or as part of a comprehensive medical plan.
