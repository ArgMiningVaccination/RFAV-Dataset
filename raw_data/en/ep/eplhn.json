While Northern California is not representative of the nation as a whole, it tends to be a harbinger of trends to come. The most widely used modalities in 1999 were herbal and other nonvitamin/nonmineral nutritional supplements, prayer/spiritual healing done by oneself, chiropractic, massage therapy, and mind-body medicine modalities. However, use of the different modalities varied significantly by age and gender, and rates of use of nutritional supplements and the manipulatives were approximately doubled, when restricted to subpopulations at high risk, for use because of relevant health conditions. There appeared to be a statistically significant, but modest increase in CAM use, mostly due to a large increase in use of nutritional supplements. Implications for how CAM use should be tracked for ambulatory care populations and the importance of addressing nutritional supplement use in ambulatory clinical care are discussed.
