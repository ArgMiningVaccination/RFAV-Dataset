Once income benefit payments have begun, you are unable to change to another option. 3 TIAA may share profits with TIAA Traditional Annuity owners through declared additional amounts of interest during accumulation, higher initial annuity income, and through further increases in annuity income benefits during retirement. These additional amounts are not guaranteed beyond the period for which they were declared. 4 If you transfer out of TIAA Traditional and transfer back in under the same contract within 120 days, the amount transferred in, up to the total amount transferred out, will be credited with the same interest rates that would have applied if the transfer out had not taken place. Such interest will be credited from the date the transfer in was made. Interest will not be paid for the period from the date of the transfer out to the date of transfer in. This rule applies to all transfers into TIAA Traditional when there are one or more transfers out within the prior 120 days. We refer to this as \"time period restoration.\" 5 Certain Retirement Choice Plus contracts impose a \"90-day equity wash rule\". Under those contracts, if your plan offers investment options known as \"competing funds\" (for example, a money market account, short-term bond funds or self-directed brokerage accounts), and you want to transfer money from TIAA Traditional to one of those options, the amount you transfer must first be directed to a noncompeting option (for example, a stock fund or intermediate-term bond fund), where it must remain for 90 days before being transferred to the competing fund, including transferring back to TIAA Traditional. (TIAA Contract form IGRSP-02-ACC / TIAA Certificate form IGRSP-CERT3-ACC). TIAA Traditional Annuity interest and income benefits include guaranteed amounts plus additional amounts as may be established on a year-by-year basis by the TIAA Board of Trustees. The additional amounts, when declared, remain in effect through the \"declaration year\", which begins each March 1 for accumulating annuities and January 1 for payout annuities. Additional amounts are not guaranteed beyond the period for which they are declared.
