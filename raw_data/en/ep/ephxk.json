Megan Franks, Sirona's owner, has an assortment of spiritual and holistic items that will help anyone on their journey towards self-exploration. It's not just a singular pagan or metaphysical store; you can find statues of angels, gods and goddesses from a multitude of cultures all over the world around her shop. The majority of what Franks provides is alternative homeopathic remedies such as dried herbs, crystals, Tibetan singing bowls and daily Reiki cleansing services. \"We offer tarot Tuesdays so you can come in on every Tuesday and get a tarot reading and that's just walk-in. Once a month, normally but not always, we have a special guest reader like Rachel, Greg, and Sandy Brown.\" Almost every week there are events going on in Sirona's. Things like palmistry and tarot readings, herbalism classes, meditation groups, seasonal ceremonies, most notably Ostara, a spring ceremony. She also provides workshops where you can make wands, anoint candles, or create a home protection wreath. Alternatively, you can go there to use her books as reference. It's a very open and welcoming store, and through her, you can even book appointments with different mediums and professional practitioners. Sirona does something with every full and new moon \"We do something with every full moon and new moon. Full moon is for releasing, and new moons are for manifesting intentions. We also do all the sabbaths. So, Christianized holidays that have a more traditional pagan holiday that's attached to them. Christmas is Yule, Easter is Ostara, Halloween is Samhein.\" And that's pronounced Sow-ween. \"It usually involves a tea, meditation, and then there's a ceremony afterwards which is comparable really to a prayer.\" The biggest message Franks wants to put out is, \"I support any belief. It doesn't matter where you come from, what you believe in, whether that's a religious background or not. If it works for you, that's great. Some people just don't go the religious way, some people find another path and it doesn't matter to me as long as you're positive. I don't support any of the other darker stuff. I'm here as long as you're on a positive route, you can believe whatever you want to believe in.\" For some who are not familiar with alternative medicine, a homeopathic lifestyle, or pagan spirituality, Sirona's is a good place to get more information. They have a large selection of books and after their expansion and renovation, which should be starting in the next couple of weeks, they will have a comfortable area where you can sit down and read. A big point that Franks wanted to make was to keep natural healing and the resources available to everyone. What started Franks on her journey to natural healing were her continual setbacks with anxiety. She felt overwhelmed constantly and the pharmaceutical medication she was prescribed just wasn't working. So, she turned to a close friend who recommended an alternative way. \"My headspace was so horrible. It was just a hard month to get through and then I was like, there's got to be a better way. And I was like I want to be around for my kids, and I have high blood pressure, and that's probably something that I could take medication for, but is there another way... I can help my blood pressure without taking medication ... or change my numbers so I'm no longer pre-diabetic. Is there a better way to take the vitamins or is there a better form?\" 'My space in general is very calming' It turns out, there is. \"I started with a lot of herbal teas... meditation helped, opening my business helped tremendously because my space in general is very calming. That's what I hear from a lot of my customers. It's like a weight lifts when they step in.\" For someone new to homeopathic or alternative medicine, Franks would suggest taking it one step at a time. \"You can't get anywhere if you don't start. A lot of the times people think they're going to do something wrong, you really can't. Like one step forward is better than no steps, so try one thing and if it doesn't work out then try another thing and find someone you can talk about it with. A lot of people want to delve in 100%, but there's so much that it's overwhelming... We recommend you still see your doctor, don't cut out big pharma, but see what you can cut. Go and see what's wrong and keep up on all that stuff but try to find also a more holistic option... so you're not taking medication to combat the symptoms of another medication.\" \"Do your own research,\" Franks stressed. \"And you can use my reference books, right now even though we don't have a reference area per se set up, you can pull out a book and look up the herb you want to use because maybe it doesn't work well with the medication that you're on, there's that. Maybe it's not really what they're marketing it as, or maybe it can cause a side effect that you're not ready for, or you're already having an issue with.\" The FDA, Franks says, is pushing back pretty hard on holistic health. They're looking at different regulations for the herbs she sells. \"From my understanding it's not heavily regulated... the biggest thing is they're not making money on it, they're losing money. So now they're going to regulate it so that only these people have access to it... We've had holistic medicine for forever. This is as old as it gets. COVID basically pushed a new movement towards a more natural approach.\" She spoke about the power of Oregano. \"Oregano is all things antifungal, antimicrobial, antibiotic, it has all of the properties you would need for healing. They recommend it for literally almost any issue. It's supposed to be a super herb.\" Sirona carries an abundance of crystals The National Institutes of Health states that, \"Essential oils of oregano are widely recognized for their microbial activity as well as their antiviral and antifungal properties. Nevertheless, recent investigations have demonstrated that these compounds are also potent antioxidants, anti-inflammatory, anti-diabetic and cancer suppressor agents.\" One thing you're bound to notice when you walk into Sirona is the abundance of crystals. \"You can get pretty much three crystals for $5 here ... and most my herbs are $2.50 or less and you can go that route as a cheaper alternative.\" Crystal healing is something Franks has training in through Sage Goddess, where she learned crystal shapes, where they're sourced from, and how to use them on the body. All of that, she uses in combination with reiki even though that's not the traditional reiki practice. Reiki, pronounced (Ray-kee) is another service Franks provides as do some of her guest practitioners. Reiki is, according to U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, NIH, \"a complementary health approach in which practitioners place their hands lightly on or just above a person, with the goal of directing energy to help facilitate the person's own healing response. It's based on an Eastern belief in an energy that supports the body's innate or natural healing abilities.\" As Franks explains, \"Reiki is energy healing therapy that works with the 108 chakras that we have in our body... We have seven major ones: we have the crown, third eye, throat, heart, solar plexus, sacral and root. And depending on what you're going through those could be blocked. So, for instance, the easiest one to explain is the solar plexus which is the stomach. Sometimes when people have diabetes that will show up blocked in their solar plexus because your spleen is where you manage your insulin.\" You can find out what the Cleveland Clinic has to say about Reiki [here](https://health.clevelandclinic.org/reiki/). \"We also do aura cleanses which is a 15-minute session with sound tools, sage, and oils. It's a little bit of a re-boost for your week. To cleanse the fields,\" Franks said. A comprehensive list of all the services and any upcoming classes at Sirona can be found "}
