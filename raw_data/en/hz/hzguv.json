In time, as others learn to unfold similar abilities, this new form of human knowledge will yield the second scientific revolution and a second cultural renaissance. The future of human civilization depends on it. Developing spiritual knowledge is within the reach of all people. While not everyone can become an occult researcher, everyone can begin the work and in doing so contribute something of importance to their personal development and our culture as a whole. Rudolf Steiner describes in minute detail how each of us can begin to unfold deeper talents hidden in the depths of our soul. In order to take the anthroposophical path of knowledge it is important to understand how meditative work changes a person, how the various meditative exercises function, and how to do them properly. About the Presentation 55 Minutes with Q/A Human beings are designed to undergo developmental processes. We see these obviously in the arch of one life in the growth of the body, the acquisition of language, and many other aspects. Anthroposophy shows us that we are also unfolding over many lifetimes. We are all on the slow-and-gentle-as-it-can-be path of karma and reincarnation, and provided you are trying to be a good person, you are designed to achieve enlightenment on this path, eventually. But we can also fast-track our individual development by taking the anthroposophical path of knowledge. The path consists of activities that trigger developmental processes that would otherwise require lifetimes of experience. About the Presenter Robert McKay is a student of Rudolf Steiner's and has a special interest in the anthroposophical path of knowledge. He is the Chair of the Board of the Rudolf Steiner College Canada, a member of the School of Spiritual Science, and a founding member of Anthroposophy in Toronto. "}
