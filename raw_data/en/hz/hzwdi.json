The Scope of Practicefor the Registered Dietitian reflects theposition of the Academy on the essen-tial role of the RD in the direction anddelivery of food and nutrition services. The Scope of Practice for the Regis- tered Dietitian is used in conjunctionwith the inNutrition and Dietetics, 1the 2012 Stan- dards of Practice in Nutrition Care andthe Standards of Professional Perfor-mance for Registered Dietitians. 2The Standards of Practice address activitiesrelated to direct patient and client care.The Standards of Professional Perfor-mance address behaviors related to theprofessional role of RDs. These standardsreflect the minimum competent level ofdietetics practice and professional per-formance for RDs. A companion docu-ment addresses the Scope of Practice forthe Dietetic Technician, Registered. 3RDs are committed to optimizing the nation's health and advancing the profes-sion of nutrition and dietetics throughsafe, person-centered, culturally compe-tent, quality food and nutrition services.Food and nutrition services provided byRDs assist individuals and populations indeveloping and maintaining eating andlifestyle behaviors that enhance healthand quality of life. RD services span a con-tinuum that includes nutrition care,foodservice systems and food systemsmanagement, education, research, tech-nology, business, communication, healthpromotion, disease prevention, and nu-trition policy. PURPOSE The document describes the Scope ofPractice for RDs. RDs are educated andtrained in food and nutrition and are in-tegral members and leaders of interdisci-plinary teams in health care, foodservicesystems, education, and other practiceenvironments. They provide services invaried settings, including health care,business and industry, communities andpublic health systems, schools, collegesand universities, the military, govern-ment, research, tness centers, privatepractice, and communications. The pur-pose of the document is to: 1. Identify the education and cre- dentialing requirements for theRD in accordance with the Ac-creditation Council for Educa-tion in Nutrition and Dietetics(ACEND) and the Commissionon Dietetic Registration (CDR),which is the credentialing age-ncy for the Academy. 2. Describe the scope of practice for the RD. 3. Educate colleagues in other health care professions, educa-tors, students, prospective stu-dents, foodservice providers,health care administrators, regu-lators, insurers, business ownersand managers, and the generalpublic about the qualications ofthe RD, competence, and profes-sional services provided by RDs. 4. Describe the relationship of the RD to the DTR to illustrate thework of the RD/DTR team provid-ing direct patient/client care, andto describe circumstances inwhich the DTR works under thesupervision of an RD. 4-6 5. Guide the Academy, ACEND, and CDR in developing and promot-ing programs and services to ad-vance the practice of nutritionand dietetics and the role of RDsas leaders in providing qualityfood and nutrition services.

WHAT IS A NUTRITIONIST? There is no uniform denition for the title\"nutritionist,\" and those states that de-ne nutritionist in statutes or regulationsdene it variantly. 11Some state licensure boards have enacted legislation that reg-ulates use of the title nutritionist and/orsets specic qualications for holding thetitle, often but not uniformly including anadvanced degree in nutrition. The Acad-emy believes that all RDs are nutritionistsbut not all nutritionists are RDs. Refer toyour state licensure board for your state'sspecic licensing act. SCOPE OF PRACTICE Scope of practice in nutrition and di-etetics encompasses the range of roles,activities, and regulations within whichnutrition and dietetics practitionersperform. For RDs, scope of practice fo-cuses on food and nutrition and relatedservices developed, directed, and pro-vided by RDs to protect the public, com-munity, and populations; enhance thehealth and well-being of patients/cli-ents; and deliver quality products, pro-grams, and services, including MedicalNutrition Therapy (MNT), across all fo-cus areas. Focus areas include, but arenot limited to, oncology, pediatrics, di-abetes, nephrology, sports, nutritionsupport, extended care, corrections,weight management and obesity, well-ness and prevention, behavioral health,eating disorders and disordered eating,intellectual and developmental disabil-ities, mental illness, addictions, inte-grative and functional medicine, foodand culinary and supermarkets, sus-tainable resilient healthy food and wa-ter systems, communities and publichealth, education, and management. Unique to RDs is the qualication to provide MNT. MNT is a cost-effective, es-sential component of comprehensive nu-trition care. 12-15Diseases or conditions may be prevented, delayed, or managed,and quality of life improved in individu-als receiving MNT. During an MNT inter-vention, RDs counsel individuals on be-havioral and lifestyle changes thatimpact long-term eating habits andhealth. MNT is an evidenced-based applica- tion of the Nutrition Care Process (NCP),including: performing a comprehensive nu-trition assessment; determining the nutrition diag-nosis; planning and implementing anutrition intervention using evi-dence-based nutrition practiceguidelines; and monitoring and evaluating an indi-vidual's progress toward goals. 16 MNT services are provided by the RD for individuals and groups utilizingmeal plans, medically prescribed dietsand tube feedings, specialized intrave-nous solutions and specialized oralfeedings, and the analysis of potentialfood and drug interactions. MNT in-volves in-depth individualized nutri-tion assessment; of thenutrition diagnosis; determination andapplication of the nutrition interven-tion personalized for the individual orgroup; and periodic monitoring, evalu-ation, reassessment and interventiontailored to manage or prevent the dis-ease, injury, or condition.This document, the Scope of Practice for the RD, does not supersede state practiceacts (ie, licensure, certication, or titleprotection laws). However, if your statelaw does not dene Scope of Practice, theinformation within this document may as-sist with identifying activities that may bepermitted within your Scope of Practicebased on your qualications (ie, training,certications, organization policies, refer-ring practitioner-directed dem-onstrated and documented competence,and clinical privileges).FROM THE ACADEMY S18 JOURNAL OF THE ACADEMY OF NUTRITION AND DIETETICS June 2013 Suppl 2 Volume 113 Number 6RDs involved in direct care perform MNT.

RDs conduct nutrition research or collaborate in nutrition research for thepurpose of demonstrating nutritionoutcomes or developing nutrition rec-On Monday, February 4, 2013, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) announced a proposed rule change* that would, among other things, \"Save hospitals signicant resources by permitting registered dietitians to order patient diets independently,which they are trained to do, without requiring the supervision or approval of a physician or other practitioner. This frees up time forphysicians and other practitioners to care for patients.\" This exciting development is designed to help health care providers operatemore efciently by getting rid of regulations that are out of date or no longer needed. It will apply only to registered dietitians (RDs)privileged by the hospital in which they work, and the change will not take effect until the rule is nalized later in 2013. The proposedrule, ofcially published in the Federal Register on Thursday, February 7, 2013, also specically claries that RDs may be included onthe medical staff, as they \"have equally important roles to play on a medical staff and on the quality of medical care provided topatients in the hospital.\"According to CMS, \"Our intent in revising the provision was to provide the flexibility that hospitals need under federal law tomaximize their medical staff opportunities for all practitioners, but within the regulatory boundaries of their State licensing andscope-of-practice laws. We believe that the greater flexibility for hospitals and medical staffs to enlist the services of non-physicianpractitioners to carry out the patient care duties for which they are trained and licensed will allow them to meet the needs of theirpatients most efciently and effectively.\"For RD reference, the relevant portions of the proposed rule are on pages 9216, 9221-9224, 9233-9235, and 9244. Under the proposedrule, qualied dietitians will be explicitly permitted to become privileged by the hospital staff to a) order patient diets, b) order labtests to monitor the effectiveness of dietary plans and orders, and c) make subsequent modications to those diets based on the labtests, if in accordance with state laws including scope of practice laws. CMS made this change because it \"believe[s] that RDs are theprofessionals who are best qualied to assess a patient's nutritional status and to design and implement a nutritional treatment planin consultation with the patient's interdisciplinary care team.\"This proposed rule responds directly to the President's instructions in Executive Order 13563 urging federal agencies to reduce orrevise outmoded or unnecessarily burdensome rules and regulations. Many of the proposed rule's provisions streamline the stan-dards health care providers must meet in order to participate in the Medicare and Medicaid programs without jeopardizing bene-ciary safety. The Academy submitted formal comments to CMS in December 2011 urging this very change, providing the evidentiaryand scientic basis upon which CMS relied in the proposed rule.It is recommended that RDs continue current facility/organization procedures in place for ordering patient diets (ie, current grantedclinical privileges) and accept and implement disease-specic and condition-specic protocol orders from the referring practitioner,as outlined in this Scope of Practice for the Registered Dietitian until the nal rule is effective later in 2013. *Medicare and Medicaid Programs; Part II\u2014Regulatory provisions to promote program efciency, transparency, and burden reduction; proposed rule.

Evidence-basedpractice that involves complex andconscious decision making based onthe best available research/evidenceand on patient/client characteristics,situations, and preferences is a tenet ofcompetent nutrition and dietetics prac-tice for the RD. To guide the RD in mak-ing evidence-based decisions, theAcademy has developed an EvidenceAnalysis Library and position (http://www.eatright.org/positions/ ) and practice papers (http://www.eatright.org/members/practicepapers/). The Ev-idence Analysis Library is a synthesis ofcontinuously updated nutrition re-search on important dietetics practicequestions and is housed within an ac-cessible, online, user-friendly library athttp://www.adaevidencelibrary.com/. 18,19 Scope of Practice in Nutrition and Di- etetics for the credentialed practitioner iscomposed of statutory and individualcomponents. Statutory scope of practiceis typically established within the prac-tice act and interpreted and controlled bythe agency or board that regulates thepractice of the profession in a givenstate. 1 Statutory Scope of Practice. \"Legal scopes of practice for the health careprofessions establish which profes-sionals may provide which health careservices, in which settings, and underwhich guidelines or parameters. Withfew exceptions, determining scopes ofpractice is a state-based activity. Statelegislatures consider and pass the prac-tice acts, which become state statute orcode. State regulatory agencies, such asmedical and other health professions'boards, implement the laws by writingand enforcing rules and regulations de-tailing the acts.\" 20Requirements for continuing education can also be spec- ied. The Academy's Denition ofTerms describes the differences be-tween licensure, statutory certication,and title protection (www.eatright.org/scope). Individual Scope of Practice. Each RD has an individual scope of practicethat is determined by education, train-ing, credentialing, and demonstratedand documented competence to prac-tice. An individual's scope of practice innutrition and dietetics has flexibleboundaries to capture the breadth ofthe individual's professional practice.Individuals and organizations mustethically take responsibility for deter- mining competence of each individualto provide a specic service. 1 In keeping with the Code of Ethics,21 individual RDs can only practice in ar-eas in which they are qualied and havedemonstrated competence to achieveethical, safe, and quality outcomes inthe delivery of food and nutrition ser-vices. Competent practitioners use up-to-date knowledge, skills, and bestpractices; make sound decisions basedon appropriate data; communicate ef-fectively with patients, customers, andothers; critically evaluate their ownpractice; identify the limits of theircompetence; and improve perfor-mance based on self-reflection, appliedpractice, and feedback from others. 22In addition, professional competence in-volves the integrative ability to engagein clinical reasoning that facilitatesproblem solving and fosters patient-centered behaviors and participatorydecision making. 23RDs utilize the Academy's Scope of Practice DecisionTool, which is an online, interactivetool, to assist them in determiningwhether an activity is within theirScope of Practice. 1 Depending on their knowledge, skills, expertise, individual interests,and competence, RDs can work in mul-tiple practice areas and settings, or fo-cus on a specic practice area or with aparticular age group. Integral to theRD's commitment to lifelong learning isthe recognition that additional knowl-edge, skills, and demonstrated compe-tence are imperative to maintain cur-rency with advances in practice and inadherence to evidence-based practiceand best practices. Lifelong learning issupported by CDR's Portfolio Develop-ment Process, which requires RDs to determine their individual continuingprofessional education needs, developaction plans, and achieve their goals tomaintain registration status with CDR. 8 RDs apply evidenced-based practice utilizing the NCP.24The NCP provides RDs with a systematic decision-mak-ing/problem-solving method to man-age nutrition care activities in multiplepractice environments. In addition, theAcademy has published the Interna- tional Dietetics & Nutrition TerminologyReference Manual: Standardized Lan-guage for the Nutrition Care Process 16to assist RDs who provide direct patient/client care in using standardized lan-guage to document application of the NCP. 25 RD ROLES: SERVICES AND ACTIVITIES The profession of nutrition and dietetics is dynamic, diverse, and continuouslyevolving. The breadth of practice withindietetics expands with advances in nutri-tion and food science, health care, and in-formation technology, and is driven bypublic health initiatives and evidence-based research demonstrating the im-pact of food and nutrition on health sta-tus, disease prevention and treatment,quality of life, and the safety and well-being of the public. The cultural diversityof the nation, longer lifespans, federal and state legislative actions, and socialand environmental trends affect profes-sional practice and the goals and objec-tives of those served by the RD. Increas-ingly, quality health care depends onactive participation by patients, clients,consumers, groups, and communities indecisions that promote health and wellbeing, as well as tness and performance.Integral to this effort, RDs play criticalroles in leading the public in incorporat-ing healthful food supplies, food choices,and eating behaviors into daily lives, andaiding individuals in making informedchoices regarding food and nutrition. RDs are nutrition and dietetics practi- tioners whose responsibilities includeproviding comprehensive food and developing food and nu-trition programs; serving on national,state, and local food and nutritionboards; and contributing to developmentof nutrition policies for individuals,groups, and populations. RDs developand translate national nutrition guide-lines, for example, Institute of Medicine,2010 Dietary Guidelines for Americans, 26 and practice guidelines of national healthorganizations and the federal govern-ment (eg, American Diabetes Associationand American Heart Association) intopractical application for the individualsand populations they serve. Food, nutrition, and dietetic services and activities performed by RDs illus-trate current practice and include butare not limited to the following: 1.

Registered Dietitian The CDR, for the Academy, denes the Registered Dietitian as an individual who has met current minimum (Baccalaureate) academic requirements with successful completion of both specied didactic educationand supervised-practice experiences through programs accredited by the ACEND of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics and whohas successfully completed the Registration Examination for Dietitians. To maintain the RD credential, the RD must comply with theProfessional Development Portfolio recertication requirements (accrue 75 units of approved continuing professional educationevery 5 years).Dietetic Technician, Registered (DTR): CDR denes the Dietetic Technician, Registered as an individual who has met current minimum requirements through one of three routes: 1) successful completion of a minimum of an Associate degree and a DieteticTechnician Program as accredited by the ACEND of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics (Academy); 2) successful completion of aBaccalaureate degree; met current academic requirements (Didactic Program in Dietetics) as accredited by ACEND of the Academy;successfully completed a supervised practice program under the auspices of a Dietetic Technician Program as accredited by ACEND;or 3) completed a minimum of a Baccalaureate degree; successfully completed a Didactic Program in Dietetics as accredited byACEND. 14,15In all three routes, the individual must successfully complete the Registration Examination for Dietetic Technicians. To maintain the DTR credential, the DTR must comply with the Professional Development Portfolio recertication requirements (accrue50 hours of approved continuing professional education every 5 years).Scope of Practice in Nutrition and Dietetics: The Scope of Practice in Nutrition and Dietetics encompasses the range of roles, activities, and regulations within which nutrition and dietetics practitioners perform. For credentialed practitioners, Scope of Practice is typically estab-lished within the practice act and interpreted and controlled by the agency or board that regulates the practice of the profession in a givenstate.Dietetics: The integration, application, and communication of principles derived from food, nutrition, social, business, and basic sciences, to achieve and maintain optimal nutrition status of individuals through the development, provision, and management ofeffective food and nutrition services in a variety of settings. Medical Nutrition Therapy (MNT): Medical nutrition therapy is an evidence-based application of the Nutrition Care Process. The provision of MNT (to a patient/client) may include one or more of the following: nutrition assessment/reassessment, nutrition diagnosis, nutrition intervention and nutrition monitoring, and evaluation, which typically results in the prevention, delay, ormanagement of diseases and/or conditions.Nutrition Care Process (NCP): The Academy's Nutrition Care Process is a process for identifying, planning for, and meeting nutri- tional needs and includes four steps: assessment, diagnosis, intervention, monitoring, and evaluation. Evidence-Based Practice: Evidence-based practice is an approach to health care wherein health practitioners use the best evidence possible, that is, the most appropriate information available, to make decisions for individuals, groups, and populations. Evidence- based practice values, enhances, and builds on clinical expertise, knowledge of disease mechanisms, and pathophysiology. It involvescomplex and conscientious decision making based not only on the available evidence but also on client characteristics, situations, andpreferences. It recognizes that health care is individualized and ever changing and involves uncertainties and probabilities. Evidence- based practice incorporates successful strategies that improve client outcomes and are derived from various sources of evidence, includingresearch, national guidelines, policies, consensus statements, systematic analysis of experience, quality improvement data, specializedknowledge, and skills of experts. Integrative and Functional Medicine: Sharing a systems biology approach to health care, both types of medicine encompass patient-centered, healing-oriented medicine that embraces conventional and complementary therapies. They represent a broader paradigm of medicine than the current dominant biomedical model. They were driven initially by consumer demand and are nowincreasingly accepted by health care providers and institutions. There are other terms describing this paradigm: personal-ized medicine, anti-aging, nutritional medicine, biological medicine, and a growing list of others. 31 Nutritional Genomics: \"An umbrella term that describes the application of genetic technology to food and nutrition and includes nutrigenetics and nutrigenomics.\" \"It is the study of how dietary and other lifestyle choices influence the function of living beings atthe molecular, cellular, organismal, and population levels.\" 32\"Nutrigenetics concerns the individual's genetic make-up (DNA) and the proteins those genes produce and how well those proteins work.\"33\"Nutrigenomics is the study of how foods affect our genes and how individual genetic differences can affect the way we respond to nutrients (and other naturally occurring compounds) in the foodswe eat.\" 34FROM THE ACADEMY June 2013 Suppl 2 Volume 113 Number 6 JOURNAL OF THE ACADEMY OF NUTRITION AND DIETETICS S27Management Committee.
