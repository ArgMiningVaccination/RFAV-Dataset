This paper reviews the radical ideas about health's emergence that have accompanied this turn, noting the core processes that are understood to always be in play. In particular, while acknowledging that not all humanistic ideas have been rejected in this work, it describes how some have been reworked and extended in 'other-than-fully conscious' and 'more-than-human' terms. The paper assesses and synthesizes this diverse literature, emphasising the novel understandings of corporeality, materiality, assemblage, relationality, vitality and affect that have become distinctive features of it. This article examines current approaches to wellbeing research in the social sciences, reviewing their underlying ontologies to explore which 'being' is implied in contemporary research on wellbeing. It critically analyses themes from the 'science of happiness' for their focus on a decontextualized and individualized subject and highlights the emergence of an alternative, developing geographical research agenda in the study of wellbeing, termed here 'intra-active wellbeing'. It is argued that this research agenda draws together formerly disparate aspects of geographical thought - classically humanistic wellbeing research and more-than-human inquiry - and creates space for a more pluralistic field of wellbeing scholarship.

The paper proposes an understanding of space that is simultaneously physical, relational, emotional, symbolic and transformative. Focusing on the practices and microgeographies involved in psychoanalytic therapy, the aim of the paper is to contribute to the body of literature dealing with psychoanalytic geography by discussing how spatial logics pervade the psychoanalytic treatment, and to test autobiography as an experience-near, subjectively immersed instrument for investigation.\" Complementary Therapies in Clinical Practice (formerly Complementary Therapies in Nursing and Midwifery) 2004 While complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) research has benefited from a range of social scientific perspectives, geographical contributions have been only slowly forthcoming. In this context, this paper illuminates the possibilities for CAM researchers to develop dedicated geographical perspectives. Some fundamental changes in the empirical and theoretical foci of medical/health geography are outlined, from a concern with mapping services and diseases in macro-space to investigating the dynamic between health and place. Highlighted are some important relational dynamics among CAM providers, patients/consumers and places of treatment and some general issues that could benefit from a geographical analysis. The concurrent research agenda is located across the sub-disciplinary strata of human geography. The metaphorical concept of 'therapeutic landscape' brings together the notion of landscape with principles of holistic health, and has been applied to a wide range of contexts to investigate how environmental, societal and individual factors 'interact to bring about healing in specifi c places' (Gesler 1992: 735). The concept, as it is operationalised in human geography and related disciplines, was originally championed by geographer Wilbert M. Gesler in the early 1990s, defi ned as a particular setting that has 'an enduring reputation for achieving physical, mental and spiritual healing' (1993 : 171). The therapeutic landscape metaphor remains, now nearly three decades later, one of the key ways to engage directly with the geographical situatedness of health-related knowledges and practices, and the concept has inspired a rich debate that has reached beyond the disciplinary boundaries of health and cultural geography, and is continuing to evolve. This chapter highlights how landscape, and the related notions of place and space, have been operationalised in the study of health processes. It will do so by sketching out the development of the now substantial literature on therapeutic landscapes through three (necessarily overlapping) 'moments' in its history: (1) landscape as a framework for the study of health in place; (2) the conceptual expansion that took place during a second 'phase' in its history of development; and (3) avenues for future work on landscapes of well-being. Each substantive section will cover the key aspects of the developmental history of the concept. There are many ways that one could categorise the research fi eld as it has taken shape over the last three decades. For instance, Williams (2009) identifi es six substantive research themes across the literature: (1) physical places known for health; (2) applications in healthcare and sites; (3) spaces of signifi cance for particular populations; (4) literary analysis of fi ction; (5) use within disciplines outside of geography; and (6) everyday sites of varied therapeutic value. Wil-liams' categorisation refl ects a number of place-focused themes (Andrews 2017), through which researchers have explored the therapeutic value of natural and built environments, capturing both extraordinary landscapes, or those explicitly designed for healing, or the more quotid-ian spaces of everyday life, as well as imagined places invoked through fi ctional literature. In the initial phase of development, research focused on broadly defi ned 'natural environments', such as woodland and wilderness spaces, gardens and engagements with water. Alongside this theme, improvement of healing through design interventions has been considered, including different healthcare settings, such as hospitals, or more broadly supportive environments such as Loading Preview Sorry, preview is currently unavailable.
