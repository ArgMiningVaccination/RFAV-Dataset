The Board called into the Worker's Compensation Board Meeting , where public commenters were informed that their testimony would be limited and that any comments related to proposed regulations would not be heard \u2014only those relating to current regulations . The Board listened to Sheri Ryan (Chief Operating Officer, ACS) testi fy regarding MSRC 11 Board of Chiropractic Examiners Board Meeting of October 6th, 2016 Page 3 of 11 coding guidelines and Medicare reimbursement as established by the American Medical Association (AMA). The hot topic issue here is in regards to the denial of reimbursement for certain procedures and diagnostic tests provided by chiropractic physicians that are otherwise reimbursed to MD's, DO's , other physicians and non-physicians, even when using the same billing codes. Sheri Ryan commented that the codes used by chiropractic physicians are acceptable in their scope and are in their standards of care, however, AK MSRC limits the types of codes chiropractors can be reimbursed for, while only reimbursing fo r adjustments . Dr. Todd Curzie, D.C. also testified on this unequal opportunity for health care services reimbursement presents an apparent disservice to the chiropractic profession, which he stated poses unnecessary time and resources filing and joining claims. The AK MSRC called for other public commenters, at which point Dr. Daniel Holt indicated that the Alaska Board would like to offer comments and asked if would be appropriate for former chair, Dr. James Heston to also testify. The AK MSRC entertained the Board's and Dr. Heston's comments. Dr. Holt introduced himself to the AK MSRC and indicated he has been a practicing chiropractor in Alaska for 25 years. Dr. Holt clarified that the concerns are in regards to limitation in payment services, not reimbursement of exams, x-rays, or extremities adjusting, which greatly restricts are scope of practice and impacts the profession economically. Dr. James Heston asserted that the limitations are discriminatory against the Alaska chiropractic workforce, and stated that the MSRC didn't comment on reducing th e services, as gleaned from a review of the organization's meeting minutes . Dr. Heston reiterated the concern that such limitations impede on the treatment of patients, and Dr. Barrington stated that it boils down to restraint of trade. Dr. Campbell commented to the Board that the Board explicitly regulates x-ray, and by the MSRC denying coverage for this service, it essentially implies that x-ray is not a necessary or acceptable component of chiropractic scope of practice. Dr. Campbell suggested writing a letter to the MSRC regarding chiropractic statutes, and the contradictions and limitations their policies are creating, which the Board was receptive to. Daniel Holt called for break at 11:15 a.m. Off the record on 11:15 a.m. On the record at 11:27 a.m. Agenda Item 5 Review Minutes Time: 11:27 a.m. 12 Board of Chiropractic Examiners Board Meeting of October 6th, 2016 Page 4 of 11 The Board reviewed the meeting minutes from May 20th, June 16th, and September 28th, 2016.

Case Study assignments are not accepted late. 5% 3 Lab Quiz zes: There will be 3 online lab quiz zes, which t ests the knowledge underlying the procedures taught in the lab. The y are worth 5% of your grade . 5% Lab Simulation: Each of you will be graded on 2 different lab simulation exercises. These are a pass/no pass. If you receive a \"no pass\" a reflective j ournal is required. Please refer to the lab handbook for guidance. Pass/No Pass Computer -Aided Instructions and Online Quizzes : The assigned computer quizzes (transfusion, CVAD and EKG ) are worth 5% of the final theory grade. Computer exercises are not accepted late. On -line tests must be taken during the assigned timeframe. 5% Kaplan: You must score 80% on each of the 8 focused review exams first. See the explanation immediately below to understand how you earn points. 10% (5% + 5%) Clinical: Any student not passing the clinical (313L) portion of the course will not pass the theory portion of the course. In other words, if a student does not pass clinical they will be required to repeat both 313 and 313L regardless of their scores in 313. Pass/ No Pass Math Test: Each student must obtain a minimum of 90% on a math test. Pass/No Pass Kaplan Test points: You receive 5 points for the test itself. How? You are not taking a \"normed\" medical surgical KAPLAN test. Therefore the normal benchmarks do not apply because there are no other standards to compare your scores to . Therefore, to create a \"standard\", I will take the average of the 3 highest scores to determine the denominator for the class . For example, if the 3 highest scores are 80%, 78% a nd 76%, then the average of those scores is 78%. It then becomes the denominator for my calculations . So, if your score is 68%, then your entered score for this test is 68/76 = 89% . In gradebook, you would then receive 0.89 TIMES 5 points which equals 4 .45 points toward your final grade. Remediation Points: You receive 5 points here. How? You must take the Critical Thinking exam on the last day of class. There is no benchmark on the test for points. You simply must complete it. You also must rem ediate the medical -surgical comprehension exam. All students must remediate every single question that they miss . . . . . . ALL students. Additionally, those students scoring less than 80% using the process I described in the previous paragraph (the 8 9% student would have exceeded the benchmark) must remediate every single question on the test. 266Remediation means reviewing the KAPLAN material on the required question s and then writing 3-4 bullets for each question describing something that you either did not know at all or could have known better. E -mail me an attached WORD file before midnight on the last day of class (12/18). Note that you take the KAPLAN medical - surgical exam on 12/11 and the course exam on 12/14. That gives you 5 - 7 days to complete this remediation before the 12/18 deadline. As always, remediation will not be accepted late. Send the e -mail to thendri3@uaa.alaska.edu COURSE GRADING POLICIES 1. THEORY EXAMS - An average of 75% must be achieved on the three exams to pass the course. Therefore, to pass this course, students must achieve a 75% average on the exams and a 75% average for the entire course. If you r course average is more than 75% but you have an exam average of less than 75%, you will earn a grade of D or the course average, whichever is lower. Theory Grades Percent Points Exam 1 1/3 Exam 2 1/3 Exam 3 1/3 You must score a 0.75 (75%) to pass the course. 1.00 2. CLINICAL - A \"Pass\" must be earned in clinical (NS 313L) to pass NS 313. 3. MATH - A score of 90% must be earned on the math exam to pass the course. 4. LATE ASSIGNMENTS -- Students are expected to complete assigned coursework as per the schedule in the course syllabus and/or announcements on Black board. Assigned coursework may be, but is not limited to, exams, quizzes, papers, care plans, journals, presentations, check -offs, remediation and any other assignments. 5. LATE OR RESCHEDULED ASSIGNMENTS AND TESTS All students are expected to complet e required assignments and tests as scheduled in the syllabus and/or announced on Blackboard. Anticipated Absences. Faculty must be notified in advance of the intent to miss the deadline for a required assignment or of the intent to miss a scheduled test . Proper notification varies with instructors. The proper media (examples are phone, face -to-face, email, voice mail, message with the receptionist) for notification and the plan for completion of the assigned coursework (usually within one week or less of the absence) will be determined by the course instructor. Clinical i nstructors may require students to complete the assigned coursework prior to the anticipated absence. Some assignments are not accepted late (see above). Missed exams will receive a 3% d eduction in the earned grade. Unanticipated Absences. Grades for assigned coursework that is late due to a student's unanticipated absence will result in the late assigned coursework receiving the 3% deduction per day with exams receiving a 3% deduction in the earned grade. 267Students who have unanticipated absences due to extenuating circumstances must notify the instructor as soon as possible. The conditions for completing the assigned coursework will be determined by the instructor. Extenuating circum stances are circumstances that prevent students from attending or submitting assigned coursework by the scheduled date. Such circumstances are rare and would be unpreventable, unforeseeable, and would have a serious impact on performance. Students could have done nothing reasonably in their power to avoid the extenuating circumstance. Things such as minor illness, poor night's sleep, and minor injury are not expected to have a serious impact on performance, so are not considered extenuating circumstances. S tudents are expected to make reasonable plans to prevent unfor eseeable circumstances such as transportation, child care, and computer problems, so these are not usually considered extenuating circumstances. It is impossible to provide a complete list of th ese things. Extenuating circumstances are circumstances which occur very rarely. They include circumstances which are verifiable, such as death of a close relative, traffic accident, or serious personal illness. (Ongoing medical conditions may be covered by disability procedures). Failure to notify faculty of absence from a required test, quiz or other assignment will be considered an unexcused absence and result in a zero (0) grade for the test, quiz or other assigned activity. 8. STUDENT CODE OF CONDUC T. The following policies will be in place during all NS313 examinations: Prior examinations are not authorized as a study source. Only a simple calculator is allowed to be used during an examination (No PDAs) No study materials are to be utilized during examinations. Ideas/answers are not shared during examinations. These specific behaviors illustrate forms of conduct that are prohibited in NS313. This is not an exhaustive list, rather it supplements the actions described in the UAA Student Code of Con duct in the UAA Catalog. Students will earn a \"Zero\" in any assignment or examination when behavior does not conform to the Code of Conduct. Further disciplinary actions may also be initiated. 9. GRADING SCALE - Keeping in mind that in order to pass t his course your exam average MUST be greater than 75%, t he following scale will be used to determine the final course grade: 93.00% to 100.00% A 84.00% C 66.00% to 74.99% D 65.99% or lower F 268 NS 313 - EARNED GRADE WORKSHEET To determine your grade, multiply the earned grade (%) by the Percent of Grade to calculate the number of points for that component of the grade.

These beliefs guide the baccalaureate nursing program at UAA. The philosophy is described in detail in University of Alaska Anchorage Schoo l of Nursing Undergraduate Student Handbook. Students are required to be familiar with this document. Conceptual Framework The conceptual framework for the baccalaureate program is comprised of four major concepts - critical thinking, caring, population and nursing role. Critical thinking is the process in which the individual uses cognitive and experiential skills to interpret, analyze, and evaluate information in order to determine a particular course of action for a specific situation. The reflective nature of critical thinking, in contributing to the development of insight, flexibility, and objectivity, enables the individual to weigh multiple options in the present and anticipate future choices of action. Upon entry into the university and into the preclinical nursing major, students are provided with learning opportunities that will enable them to acquire basic skills in critical thinking. Upon entry into the clinical major, attention is focused on adapting those critical thinking skills to the disc ipline of nursing and on the development of increased skill in critical thinking. At successive levels of the curriculum, models and processes that reflect the conscious application of critical thinking skills are introduced and practice opportunities are provided. Upon graduation, the student will have acquired skill in the application of a variety of models for carrying out critical thinking in a variety of clinical settings that demonstrates synthesis and adaptation for changing situations. Caring is an interactive process that combines learned humanis tic and scientific modes of helping with the behaviors that provide meaning to nursing actions. Caring includes \"caring for\" (actions or treatments), \"caring about\", and \"caring with\" human beings in a var iety of settings that is undertaken by nurses as care providers and partners to facilitate the improvement or maintenance of health. Population is defined as the client system toward whom caring by the nurse is focused at a given point in time. Both the situation and the setting will in fluence the focus of nursing care, which will predominantly involve the in dividual, the family, small groups, aggregates, and communities. Role is a status that defines and describes the be havioral expectations which al l persons who hold similar positions are ex pected to perform. The concept of role includes func tions filled by and the competencies exercised by individuals and groups in socio -culturally variable settings. Within this context, the curricular design atte nds specifically to the roles of the learner, of the professional nurse, and of the population toward who caring is directed. The conceptual framework is described in detail in University of Alaska Anchorage School of Nursing Undergraduate Student Handboo k. Students are required to be familiar with this document. Required textbooks : Lewis, S., Dirksen S., Heitkemper, Bucher L. & Camera, I. (2011). Medical Nursing , (8th ed.). St. Louis: Mosby. Arikian , V. (201 2). Kaplan Nu rsing: The Basics , New York: Kaplan Nursing. Teaching Methods : Lecture, multimedia, blackboard, computer -assisted instruction. 275Discussion Board. There is a discussion board forum open called \"Your Muddiest Point\". If you have questions about any content or anything you don't understand, post it here. One of the instructors will answer your questions. Other students can respond to the questions also, or add more discussion points to the forum. Evaluation Methods : Exams : There are 3 examinations; each contributes 25% to the final grade . Computerized Exams are administered at the start of a regular class period promptly and last approximately 90 minutes; they consist of 65 multiple choice items . The student must achieve a 75% average on the exams to pass the class . In addition, students must achieve an overall grade of 75% on assignments for the class grade. Exam Rules 1. There will be no review of the exam. You will be given 15 minutes at the end of the exam to review the rationale. 2. If there are questions, query forms must be submitted by Fridays at 2000. Query forms can be found on Bb. 3. An appointment must be made with either instructor to review the exam further. 4. We are not able to answer all questions, especially if the answer wil l give you the answer to the question . 5. If late to class on exam days, no extra time will be given to take the exam. 6. Cell phones must be silenced during exams. They are not to be used at any time on exam day. They should not be visible either unless you get permission from the instructor. 7. All coat s, textbooks and bags will be place at the sides of the room. 8. There will be time for each exam to review the rationale for the questions. They will open when you finish the exam. Group Quizzes (1% of final grade) NS 406 utilizes Team Based Learning concepts including and not limited to the use of IF -AT cards. A special type of scoring card known as an IF -AT (scratch and win) is used. Teams negotiate which answer to choose and then scratch an opaque coating, hoping to find a star that indicates a correct answer. If the team does not discover a star, they continue to discuss the question and sequentially select other choices. Every student leaves this test knowing the correct answer to every question! Quiz contents consist of the assigned readings for that day; this requires adult based learning and studying of the assigned material. The quizzes are given at the beginning of each class first as individual then as a group. G roups are given 15 -20 minutes to discuss a nd answer the questions. 276Scoring is as follows: Individual grade: 1% of total grade Group Grade: 1% of total grade 1st Correct answer (only one scratched off) = 4 points 2 scratches = 2 points 3 scratches = 1 point 4 scratches = 0 points All score cards with each student's names are to be turned in to the professor before leaving class. Kaplan: Prior to taking the proctored exam, all students MUST successfully pass each of the four (4) non-proctored exams with a 7 3%. The non -proctored exams are worth 6% of the final grade. Failure to complete the exams before the class they are assigned will result in a zero (0) grade for that exam. Check the syllabus calendar for due dates. The non -proctored exams required are: 1. Math for Critical Care 2. Management of Care, any version. 3. Neurology 4. Oncology Kaplan: There will be one proctored Kaplan exam given during the semester. Every student must take this exam and remediate to pass this class . The exam contains 75 questions with a 90 minute ti me allocation. All questions are multiple choice. If your score on the exam is: 1. 73% (benchmark) or higher : a. You receive 100% for the 7% of their grade. b. To obtain the additional 2% of the grade, the student must complete remediation on their incorrect answers. 2. Below 7 3%: a. You will receive a portion of the 7% based on your score . b. To obtain the additional 2% of the grade: i. You must also remediate EVERY question. ii. Submit remediation on 10 questions of your choosing. Each question should have five (5) detailed points that explain, outline, and clarify why the answer was incorrect and provide information that supports the correct answer. Email this to Professor Davis . This will be due 4/10/16 by midnight. 3. In conclusion, to receive the full 9% of the Kaplan grade you must score 7 3% or higher and remediate the questions you missed. 4. If any portion if incomplete or late, the student will receive a zero (0). a. If you did not receive a response from Professor Davis to your email, you should email again to prevent receiving a zero for the grade. 277Determination of Final Course Grade : Evaluation of student progress toward accomplishment of course objectives is based on performance on the following: Examinations ( 3 @ 25% each) 75% A 75% average on the exams must be met to achieve a passing grade for the class. Kaplan proctored exam 9% Kaplan non -proctored exams 7% Comprehensive case study 7% Group Quiz 2% Total 100% BACCALAUREATE PROGRAM GRADING POLICIES Determination of Grades All course assignment grades (tests, papers, projects) in the Baccalaureate Program will be calculated to 2 decimal places for entry into the grade book. No rounding will take place in the calculation of these grades (i.e. 83.5673 will be 83.56 ). Students have one week after the return of an assignment, test, quiz or paper to discuss a change of grade for the assignment with the instructor based on verifiable rationale. After one week, the grade becomes permanent and will be used in calculating the final course grade. Final grades will be calculated by adding and weighing the assignment grades per the course syllabus. Exam Grading Policy for this C lass. An item analysis is run after each exam. The instructors look at discrimination, difficult y, and question attempt statistics for each question. Based on this analysis, a decision will be made about points given back. Questions are not \"thrown out\". This analysis takes time. An email will be sent to the class when the analysis is done about w hat actions were taken. Grade Scale Grading scale for the Bachelor of Science, Nursing Science Program is as follows: A = 93 - 100% B = 84 - 92.99% C = 75 - 83.99% D = 66 - 74.99% : F = 65.99% and below 278Course Policies University and College Attendance Policy for Undergraduate Courses : The School of Nursing adheres to the University's attendance policy which states : \"Absence from more than 10 percent of the scheduled class sessions, whether excused or unexcused, is exce ssive and the instructor may choose to exact a grade penalty for such absences.\" (UAA Undergraduate Bulletin, School of Nursing Undergraduate Student Handbook). It is the student's responsibility to meet course objectives, excessive absences may prevent the completion of course objectives. Attendance in the assigned labs is mandatory and considered clinical time. Scrubs will be worn in the lab. Courtesy : Exten d common courtesies to your fellow students. This means allowing others to speak if you have already spoken once or twice, turning off cellular phones and beepers during class, and refraining from bringing children to class.

Documentation of illness may be obtained from a physician or nurse practitioner (including Student Health Center staff). Students who are unable to take the ex am for reasons of family emergency are required to provide documentation of on -going emergency. It is the student's responsibility to make arrangements with the instructor to schedule a delayed test. Failure to make arrangements to delay an exam in advanc e of the scheduled time will receive a grade of zero on the exam that was missed. Delayed exams must be taken at the earliest possible time after the scheduled date, preferably within two class days following the originally scheduled exam date. Cheatin g, Plagiarism, or Other Forms of Academic Dishonesty Disciplinary action may be initiated by the university and disciplinary sanctions imposed against any student found responsible for committing, attempting to commit, or intentionally assisting in the commission of academic dishonesty. Academic dishonesty applies to examinations, assignments, laboratory reports, fieldwork, practicums, creative projects, or other academic activities. 279 The following examples constitute forms of academic dishonesty prohib ited by the Student Code of Conduct and are not intended to define prohibited conduct in exhaustive terms, but rather to set forth examples to serve as guidelines for acceptable and unacceptable behavior: a. presenting as their own the ideas or works of othe rs without proper citation of sources; b. utilizing devices not authorized by the faculty member; c. using sources (including but not limited to text, images, computer code, and audio/video files) not authorized by the faculty member; d. providing assistance with out the faculty member's permission to another student, or receiving assistance not authorized by the faculty member from anyone (with or without their knowledge); e. submitting work done for academic credit in previous classes, without the knowledge and advance permission of the current faculty member; f. acting as a substitute or utilizing a substitute; Safety from Sexual Violence (Title IX) Members of the university community, guests and visitors have the right to be free from sexual violence.

Chair - Gail Holtzman, MSN, CCRN , CNE afgmh@uaa.alaska.edu 102E 786-4589 Below is a little bit of information about the courses you will be taking in the next 5 semesters . All courses will require that you be proficient with math skills, writing, using APA format and the use of the computer for e -mail, searches and Blackboard. We make the assumption that since you received a passing grade in previous courses, that you will use the informatio n in subsequent courses. Just as you will learn about Nursing Process in NS300, you will use it in all the other courses. The pre -requisite courses that you took , such as nutrition and statistics will be continually used in the nursing courses throughout the nursing program. All courses that have L or laboratory in the name are courses that you will do outside the classroom either in a facility, skills lab or in the community. All laboratory courses require preparation prior to the clinical day and turning in paperwork after clinical for evaluation. We would ask that you not work the nights prior to clinical days so that you are well rested and safe to care for vulnerable patients. 2nd Semester Sophomore - 1st semester of Nursing Major SPRING 2015 Thes e courses run for 14 weeks and are prerequisites for the following semesters.

Stephen Lowe, DC, RN 291Board or Commission: _____________________________________________ Tab #______ Topic: __________________________________ Primary Motion Motion : 0 Board Member Motion 2nd Yes Vote No Vote Abstain Recu se Comments Subsidiary Motion or Amendment Motion : 0 Board Member Motion 2nd Yes Vote No Vote Abstain Recu se Comments 292EXECUTIVE SESSION MOTION Sec. 44.62.310. Government meetings public. (c) The following subject may be considered in an executive session: (1) matters, the immediate knowledge of which would clearly have an adverse effect upon the finances of the public entity; (2) subjects that tend to prejudice the reputation and character of any person, provided the person may request a public discussion; (3) matters which by law, municipal charter, or ordinance are required to be confidential; (4) matters involving consideration of government records that by law are not subject to public disclosure. MOTION WORDING: \"In accordance with the provisions of Alaska Statute 44.62.310 (c), I move to go into executive session for the purpose of discussing (select the appropriate statutory citation for the situation): (1) matters, the immediate knowledge of which would clearly have an adverse effect upon the finances of the public entity; OR (2) subjects that tend to prejudice the reputation and character of any person, provided the person may request a public discussion; OR (3) matters which by law, municipal charter, or ordinance are required to be confidential; OR (4) matters involving consideration of government records that by law are not subject to public disclosure. Board staff is requested to remain during the session OR Board only to remain during session. \" Staff will then state \" The board is off the record at __________(time). \" 293ALASKA BOARD OF CHIROPRACTIC EXAMINERS PO SITION STATEMENT: ADVERTISEMENT OF FREE SERVICES Date : Status : Organized by : Adopted by : PURPOSE : The purpose of this position statement is to discourage the public advertisement of free services at a chiropractic office, including but not limited to: x -rays, examinations, therapies or other services. Free offerings of appliances, vitamins and other non -service items are not condemned. HISTORY : Advertising of chiropractic services has historically bee n a source of friction in the chiropractic community. Recently, a complaint by a chiropractic office regarding the advertisement by another office for free x -rays and examinations was made verbally to a Board member, expressing the feeling that this form of advertisement demeaned the profession, and lessened the seriousness of examination and x- ray. It was also stated that this type of offer might lead to a \"no -out-of-pocket -expense\" (NOOPE) scheme where insurance would be billed, but the patient would no t be charged. SUPPORTIVE MATERIAL : None available. SUMMARY : As there is very little public distinction between chiropractic practices and chiropractic is often categorized, unfairly, as a \"one service\" profession, the Board is sympathetic to the need for many chiropractic offices to advertise services publicly. NOOPE schemes are not allowed . The Board agrees that advertising free services, although not specifically prohibited, promotes an unfavorable public perception of the profession and lends to confusion. Free public or in -office \"screenings\" are encouraged and supported. 294ALASKA BOARD OF CHIROPRACTIC EXAMINERS POS ITION STATEMENT: INJECTABLE NUTRIENTS Date : Status : Organized by : Adopted by : PURPOSE : The purpose of this statement i s to support the use of injectable nutrients by qualified Chiropractic Phyisicians. STATEMENT: The ABOCE supports the use of injectable nutrients by Chiropractic Physicians with appropriate training. Although the Alaska Chiropractic Statutes and Regulations do not specifically mention injectable nutrients, the chiropractic profession has historically been an authority on nutrition for Alaskans to rely upon when consulting for health care needs and issues, and nutrition science is part of the core curriculum training of Chiropractic Physicians. As the science of nutrition evolves, the method of application of vitamins, minerals and homeopathic solutions may change, and the ABOCE supports new methods with appropriate training. HISTORY : The issue of chiropractic use of injectable nutrients has been discussed by the Board since 2006 when Dr. John Shannon, Chiropractic Physician licensed in Alaska, first came to the Board for approval of this treatment method. Since that time, there has been at least one Board letter allowing the procedure and an opinion from the State Ombudsman's office stating that the law is vague enough to allow the treatment. The definition of Chiropractic desc ribes a healing method which does not use \"prescription drugs or surgery\". Since those regulations were established, vitamins have been labeled a drug by certain governmental agencies, and in 2010, the State of Alaska added to the Chiropractic Regulations that any substance which had the label \"Warning, Federal law prohibits the use without prescription\", could not be prescribed by a chiropractor. The ABOCE believes that the Statutes and Regulations regarding Chiropractic should be modernized to specifically allow certain substances and devices with this label to be used by Chiropractic Physicians in Alaska, and had not anticipated these changes in a timely manner 295in order to prevent this situation. Also, a te stimony in front of the Board (telephonically) on July 12, 2013 by Todd Ar aujo, Esq. from the Attorney General's office, urged the Board to condemn the use of injectable nutrients because it was not part of Chiropractic \"core curriculum\", and when sterile water is added to a vitamin, it becomes a \"prescription drug\". The Board, however, maintains that the science of nutrition is part of the core curriculum training of Chiropractic Physicians, and the method o f application: oral, parenteral or injectable, is something a Chiropractic Physician may study and learn to provide safely to patients. SUPPORTIVE MATERIAL : Statute Sec. 08 .20.900(1) \"ancillary methodology\"; methods, procedures, modalities, devices, and m easure s commonly used by trained and licensed health care providers\"; \"counseling on dietary regimen\". SUMMARY : Chiropractic Physicians are t rained in nutrition as part of their core education and have historically been a professional source for nutritional advice and treatment by Alaskans. Current Statutes and Regulations for the Chiropractic profession in Alaska should be modernized to specifically allow chiropractors to continue to provide quality service and in the manner and form that patient's heal th condition may require. The ABOCE will work with the Alaska Chiropractic Society to introduce appropriate legislative changes to bring the profession of Chiropractic to the level demanded by changes in the profession itself as well as regulatory bodies. At present, the ABOCE supports the use of injectable nutrients by Chiropractic Physicians with appropriate training and support, as implied by current regulation. 296ALASKA BOARD OF CHIROPRACTIC EXAMINERS POSITION STATEMENT: MASSAGE THERAPISTS Date: January 22, 2016 Status: New Organized by: Alaska Board of Chiropractic Examiners Adopted by: Alaska Boa rd of chiropractic Examiners PURPOSE: Pur pose of this position statement is to acknowledge the formation of the Massage Board and support the employment of massage therapists who are recognized and authorized by the Board. HISTORY: Historically, chiropractic physicians have hired massage therapists for direct patient contact in their offices. The formation of the Massage Board by the Legislature of the State of Alaska provides a comprehensive Registry and background information gathering system of prospective massage therapists for licensure, providing the public with assurances of proper training and safety in this field. SUMMARY: The Alaska Board of Chiropractic Examiners encourages all Chiropractic Physicians practicing in the State of Alaska to ensure that any massage therapist employed in direct patient services have licensure from the Massage Board.

Protect the public by delivering safe, eective care Logistically feasible Reasonable uniformity CCCA Program Core Values 1. It's the right thing to do. Patients must have condence that the person delivering therapies is professional, competent, and knows the limits of his or her training. 2. It is imperative that chiropractors show commitment to quality and standardization of healthcare protocols for a solid position in the future of healthcare. 3. Lack of uniformity in training is leading to confusion about scope and duration. 4. Insurers are often required to certify that all covered care will be delivered by a licensed clinic ian. 5. The incidence of malpractice cases due to burns is roughly 5%. 6. Payment for therapies not performed solely by a D.C. may be disallowed . 7. Stakeholders who oer training, examination, and certi cation programs will benet from modest revenue streams . 8. If national standards are not established by the chiropractic profession, insurance regulators and providers may create their own policies . Program Design CCCA Program Goals The doctor in a busy practice needs to hire and train quickly The chiropractic assistant needs to be able to start working with patients within two weeks The program must be aordable for both practicing DC and chiropractic assistant The training must be reasonably consistent and make educational sense The examination must be valid, reliable, aordable, and widely available The internship must guarantee exposure to a broad variety of conditions and be economically viable The regulated process must be feasible for boards to implement The certi cation must be professional , portable , and subject to fair disciplinary processes Eligibility Requirements At least 18 years of age High school graduate or equivalent Criminal background check Training Available online, in person, or both from approved providers including state associations, chiropractic colleges, and private vendors Core syllabus Identi ed professional competencies Examination Available from NBCE Clinical Internship Onsite, accessible supervision Work performed during internship is billable by DC Supervisor and CA sign adavit of completion to apply for regulated status Regulation Registration prior to exam and internship Pass criminal background check Regulated status granted after requirements met (may be termed licensure, certication, registration at board's preference) Continuing education required to maintain status Disciplinary provisions National Registry Allows CCCA mobility Oers support for boards during regulatory development Grandfathering Provisions Certify CAs who already meet criteria 351JW/tlf543jw 092404b STATE OF ALASKA DEPARTMENT OF COMMUNITY AND ECONO MIC DEVEL OPMENT POLIC Y & PROCEDURES Procedure No. DOL - 21 Page 1 OF 5 Effective Date Oct 2004 SUBJECT CONTINUIN G EDUCATIO N AUDI T PROCESS Supersedes Proc.

In the big scheme of things involving workers compensation you probably receive the le ast amount information of everyone in the process. This guide is intended to clarify your important role in the workers compensation process. It is to inform you and add confidence to your process. We wil l attempt to outline the Workers Compensation procedure in a simple way including the regulation and how it related to you. The law and regulation is included for your use and you can find it on line, in book form , from the Alaska Workers Compensation Board and it is usually available at your local library. It is import that you understand your rights and responsibilities. The working health care provider entails some complications in their providing of services. It has a lot of details but no one is clearly outlining them to you and your staff. The physician has important legal requirements to follow and the other part of his or her team need to understand that they have a very important role in the process also. T his ensures continuity of claims and assist the staff in understanding the law and clarifying how getting paid works. It takes out the questions that insurers leave providers with because really no one is informing them of their rights and responsibilities. Also there is no attorneys in workers compensation helping secure payments for providers and physicians. It is hugely important that the health care providers understand their important roles. This will attempt to clarify your role and explain the leg al process. Knowledge is power here and it can and will stop many of the run around situations because you will understand that you your role and the law. You don't have to be a lawyer to participate but it is important that you take away the guessing game and get the law as it pertains to you. It will stop insurers from tricking you about the law and or even asking you to return payments. There is a specific process for the insurer to follow to take money back from you and if they don't follow that they don't get their money back. We will discuss this further later. Looking At The Process And the Treatment of Injured Workers When working with injured workers there is some important information that gets you started in the process. There are important t iming issues and requirements that you must start with. 1. A treatment plan must be filed with the insurer as per 23.30.095 section c. This treatment plan is critical to your payment for services. The treatment plan must be filed within 14 days of the init ial treatment of the injured worker. There are three things you must submit to the insurer. A. The treatment plan, B. Chart notes C. You're billing. 365 There is a physician's report form published by the State of Alaska it is form number 07 - 6102. I have included it here for your review and use. This is a really usable form and you can also write out the treatment plan in your own format to but it is one on the parts of the legal requirement for payment. This is important because your payment will not be processed by the insurer if you do not meet the legal requirement. Your clock for payment is important because it allows you to demand payment and attac h demand penalties and interest that is available to you without an order or award by the Alaska Worker's Compensation Board. If you submit a treatment plan and it is not acknowledged attach a stamen on the treatment plan that if there is any objections the insurer must notify you in writing within 48 hours of receipt of the plan. This stops games about payment and is the first legally required step. B. There is the second thing that you need to provide is the chart notes that the doctor/provider makes as he or she sees the injured worker. C. Your Billing: Whatever billing you do must accompany your physicians report and the chart notes. Hint: Keep a log / record of sending the insurer your three important parts. If you send bills that get lost or neg lected send them return receipt or fax them and keep a copy of that report that indicated that the fax was received. This is important in asking for penalties and interest. We will discuss this further. It is a legal requirement to serve the documents on the insurer and or their attorney this is called service. Payment of Compensation Payments for the services your rendering is payable in 14 days. You can find the actual law in AS23.30.155 Section (a) (b)(d) Also in 23.30.097 section 3 (d) What does this mean to you? Okay you send the bill chart note and physicians report and you should receive your payment for services in 14 days. If you do not receive it when 21 days rolls around then it is time to attach a penalty of 25% of the face value and interest attaches. See AS 23.30.155 section (e) If the bills are growing and you still have not been paid then you may consider filing a claim for payment to the Alaska Workers Compensation Board, we can discuss this in a later section. In section d the employer must controvert or deny a benefit with in the 21 days. So if there is not an IME (Independent Medical Evaluator) that disagrees with the treatment payment is due. There must be a medical reason or opinion that the treatment was not reasonable or necessary. 366If there is a denial or controversion then you can still expect payment up to the time the controversion is issued. So say of you provide treatment in March and payment is not made then later you receive a controversion notice payment is due if you did the billing steps. They must pay up to the controversion issuance. The controversion form wc6105 and wc6105n. I have included both forms for your use and review. There are substantially different. The form was updated and gives you more inform ation for your rights to recovery. Here are some simple examples of things that may lead to controversion: A. Injured worker is scheduled for a procedure or surgery the insurer is not providing pre - authorization. There is no requirement for preauthorization in workers compensation. The insurer may lead you to believe that preauthorization is required but after careful review of the regulation you will see there is no requirement but that the injury must be reported and the health care provider must provide a treatment plan , chart note and bill for that payment. If they deny benefits that have not been controverted then ask for their supporting information for the controversion. They must have in their possession medical information to prove the treatment is not necessary. Just because the insurer believes the injured worker is not entitled does not prevent or stop payment. The proper procedure is provide the treatment and bill according to the rules. I know that there it is a normal procedure for other form s of insurance to get authorization but workers compensation is a guaranteed benefit and allows you to recover your fees for service. B. The injured worker has attended an independent medical evaluation. It is required by law that the employer can require and injured worker to see a physician of their choice. They can ask the employee to see their physician every sixty days after the first fourteen days of care. See AS 23.30.095 section (e). This is a time that you may be asked to provide travel and or o ther restrictions in writing to accommodate the employee. The employee must submit or they can have their benefits suspended until they cooperate. We all know that some of the IME's no longer practice and some do some make all their money rendering these opinions. Many times they are not favorable to injured workers. Some are hired solely to deny benefits or create disputes so that the insurer can legally withhold or delay treatment. Some of their reports are substantially different from the treatment and diagnosis that you may have rendered. This can generate that denial notice in a hurry. It is Very, Very important that you review and comment on that report. This is critical, it can get the employee a SIME Second Independent Medical Evaluation, and be the tiebreaker t o help the Alaska Workers Compensation Board determine if the treatment was reasonable and or necessary. The SIME should be requested within 60 days of the issuance of the IME report. It can be done after that upon petition by the injured worker. This is a really important phase in claims, your participation is paramount to the success of the workers rebuttal of the independent evaluator. If you agree or disagree is very important to the success of the claim. 367C. Sometimes claims are also controverted for the injured workers not signing releases, no complying with medical treatment or surgical treatments. So What Happens After the Contr oversion Once the insurer wants to controvert your services or the claims of the worker they must do so on a controversion form. There are two forms, one is the older form and once is the newest form updated in 2013. I have included the forms for your us e and review. The controversion form wc6105 and wc6105n. After a controversion is issued what happens to your payment. When you look at payment of compensation the regulation is clear. As 23.30.155 (a) states that compensation is payable without an award . In section 23.30.155 (d) the regulation states that if 21 days the insurer must file a controversion notice. This means that if you provide services say in March 2013 and the claim is not controverted until October 2013 then payment would be due without an award up to the date of controversion. Services after the controversion notice should be filed on a claim for benefits. We will discuss this more in a later section. If you join the claim and file your own claim for services you will be included in all hearing and settlement negations. This will ensure your payment. Many times providers do not involve themselves and lose out on their fees. When you join the claim and file for your services the insurer must include you in settlement talks. They can not leave you out of the payment process. Unpaid and late payments can incur a 25% late payment but you have to know this attaches after 21 days have passed. It also attaches interest for the time the payments are unpaid. It should occur without asking the Alaska Workers Compensation Board for an award. See As 23.30.095 (e), interest AS 23.30.155 (p) Once you file a claim you can ask for information from the insurance to prove your claims this exchange of information it is often referred to as discovery. You can conduct discovery to seek information from the insurer to show when they received your paperwork and what evidence they had to deny your claims for payment. The insurer is responsible to write to you every thirty days to explain to you why all or a portion of your payment is denied. Many times they do not do this but it is the law and you can tell them that you want to know every thirty days. You can also file a claim with the Division of Insurance as a consumer complaint. The controversion in n o way means the claim is closed for good, it only means that a hearing at the Alaska Workers Compensation Board to decide the issues. It also does not mean that you will not be paid. A hearing is necessary and is held to decide the disputed issues within two years from the date of controversion and protects the rights of the parties . At that hearing the 368AWCB will decide any issues that are outstanding in the claims such as medical treatment, time loss, medical payments, and any type of benefits that the em ployee or any interested parties would like a decision on. What to Do If I Need to File a Claim Sometime you may want to file a claim. If a controversion is issued or if you have services adding up and are not getting answers then you can file a claim for medical services that are owed to you. A claim for services is always a smart idea because when you do that you're informed of the progress of the claim and a settlement cannot happen unless you are paid. The insurer cannot adjust your CPT codes and reduce your payments. When this happens file a claim for the amount of the reduction and ask for a penalty and interest. You can also file one by obtaining form Claim for Benefits (Form 07 -6106) . If you need assistance or have questions you may contact the AWCB at the numbers listed and or call Barbara Williams at 907 - 854- 5367 for assistance or questions. Sometimes it is easier with a navigator to ensure you're not missing steps. What If the Insurer Ask To Be Paid Back This is a new thing maybe an old thing, but here is where it is super important to know the regulation. The Alaska Workers Compensation Board does not require you to reimburse the insurer. In fact that should never happen unl ess the insurer presents you with an order from the Alaska Workers Compensation Board. There some specific rules for repayment of compensation where overpayment has been made in any form. The insurer may only ask for 20% of future payments to recoup any money that they have over paid you. See AS 23.30.155 section (j) (j) If an employer has made advance payments or overpayments of compensation, the employer is entitled to be reimbursed by withholding up to 20 percent out of each unpaid installment or installments of compensation due.********* More than 20 percent of unpaid installments of compensation due may be withheld from an employee only on approval of the board. ******** Soo if you have received payment DO NOT RETURN IT!!!! Y ou don't have to return anything until that order shows up from the Alaska Workers Compensation Board in the form of a judgment showing you owe money 369back. An order is not a demand in verbal or written form it must come from the AWCB. If you have taken money from another insurer for the same injury you can refund the third party before you should the workers compensation insurer because it would be handled like a reimbursement for overpayment. Sometimes this happens when the insurer has issued a controv ersion notice and the injured workers ask their third party insurer to pay for services. Sometimes insurers pay up all the bills in anticipation of controversion and or settlement. Another thing is that if you are not summoned to the Workers Compensatio n Board the insurer could not possibly have this order. You would have to have participated in the hearing before that kind of order could be issued. So rest assured that you would be included in any kind of process like that. Wrapping It Up Hopefull y this clears up those mystery issues about payment and repayment. I know that working with insurance is a challenge and workers compensation is an even bigger challenge because who knows the rules. An important thing to know is that the Alaska Workers C ompensation Board has technicians that can answer may questions you may have they are available in Anchorage at 907 -269-4980. And in Juneau at 907- 465-2790. I am also a resource and I can be reached at 907 -631-0833 and 907 -854-5367. Please call with those questions. I have included the law and the forms for this publication. I also provided definitions that may be useful to clarify and define your relationship to workers compensation. P lease, please call if you need assistance and or forms or general help. You are now informed more than the insurers, you have the law so use it with confidence and thanks for your interest in the tutorial . 370 The Alaska Workers Compensation Regulations AS 23.30.155. Payment of Compensation. (a) Compensation under this chapter shall be paid periodically, promptly, and directly to the person entitled to it, without an award , except where liability to pay compensation is controverted by the employer. To controvert a claim the employer must file a notice, on a form prescribed by the director, stating (1) that the right of the employee to compensation is controverted; (2) the name of the employee; (3) the name of the employer; (4) the date of the alleged injury or death; and (5) the type of compensation and all grounds upon which the right to compensation is controverted. (b) The first installment of compensation becomes due on the 14th day after the employer has knowledge of the injury or death. On this date all compensation then due shall b e paid. Subsequent compensation shall be paid in installments, every 14 days, except where the board determines that payment in installments should be made monthly or at some other period . (c) The insurer or adjuster shall notify the division and the employee on a form prescribed by the director that the payment of compensation has begun or has been increased, decreased, suspended, terminated, resumed, or changed in type. An initial report shall be filed with the division and sent to the employee within 28 days after the date of issuing the first payment of compensation. If at any time 21 days or more pass and no compensation payment is issued, a report notifying the division and the employee of the termination or suspension of compensation shall be filed with the division and sent to the employee within 28 days after the date the last compensation payment was issued. A report shall also be filed with the division and sent to the employee within 28 days after the date of issuing a payment increasing, decrea sing, resuming, or changing the type of compensation paid. If the division and the employee are not notified within the 28 days prescribed by this subsection for reporting, the insurer or adjuster shall pay a civil penalty of $100 for the first day plus $10 for each day after the first day that the notice was not given. Total penalties under this subsection may not exceed $1,000 for a failure to file a required report. Penalties assessed under this subsection are eligible for reduction under (m) of this section. A penalty assessed under this subsection after penalties have been reduced under (m) 371of this section shall be increased by 25 percent and shall bear interest at the rate established under AS 45.45.010 . (d) If the employer controverts the right to compensation, the employer shall file with the division and send to the employee a notice of controversion on or before the 21st day after the employer has knowledge of the alleged injury or death. If the employer controverts the right to compensation after payments have begun, the employer shall file with the division and send to the employee a notice of controversion within seven days after an installment of compensation payable without an award is due . When payment of temporary disability benefits is controverted solely on the grounds that another employer or another insurer of the same employer may be responsible for all or a portion of the benefits, the most recent employer or insurer who is party to the claim and who may be liable shall make the payments during the pendency of the dispute. When a final determination of liability is made, any reimbursement required, including interest at the statutory rate, and all costs and attorney fees incurred by the prevailing employer, shall be made within 14 days after the determination. (e) If any installment of compensation payable without an award is not paid within seven days after it becomes due, as provided in (b) of this section, there shall be added to the unpaid installment an amount equal to 25 percent of the installment. This additional amount shall be paid at the same time as, and in addition to, the installment, unless notice is filed under (d ) of this section or unless the nonpayment is excused by the board after a showing by the employer that owing to conditions over which the employer had no control the installment could not be paid within the period prescribed for the payment. The additiona l amount shall be paid directly to the recipient to whom the unpaid installment was to be paid . (f) If compensation payable under the terms of an award is not paid within 14 days after it becomes due, there shall be added to that unpaid compensation an a mount equal to 25 percent of the unpaid installment. The additional amount shall be paid at the same time as, but in addition to, the compensation, unless review of the compensation order making the award as provided under AS 23.30.008 and an interlocutory injunction staying payments is allowed by the court. The additional amount shall be paid directly to the recipient to whom the unpaid compensation was to be pa id. (g) [Repealed, Sec. 3 ch 59 SLA 1981]. (h) The board may upon its own initiative at any time in a case in which payments are being made with or without an award, where right to compensation is controverted, or where payments of compensation have been increased, reduced, terminated, changed, or suspended, upon receipt of notice from a person entitled to compensation, or from the employer, that the right to compensation is controverted, or that payments of compensation have been increased, reduced, termin ated, changed, or suspended, make the investigations, cause the medical examinations to be made, or hold the hearings, and take the further action which it considers will properly protect the rights of all parties. 372(i) When the director considers it advisable, the director may require an employer to make a deposit with the Department of Revenue to secure the prompt and convenient payment of the compensation, and payments from the deposit upon an award shall be made upon order of the director. (j) If an employer has made advance payments or overpayments of compensation, the employer is entitled to be reimbursed by withholding up to 20 percent out of each unpaid installment or installments of compensation due. ********* More than 20 percent of unpaid installments of compensation due may be withheld from an employee only on approval of the board. ******** (k) An injured employee, or in case of death the employee's dependents or personal representative shall give receipts f or payment of compensation to the employer paying the compensation and the employer shall produce the receipts for inspection by the director, whenever required. (l) [Repealed, Sec. 1 ch 83 SLA 1975]. (m) On or before March 1 of each year, the insurer or adjuster shall file a verified annual report on a form prescribed by the director stating the total amount of all compensation by type, the number of claims received and the percentage controverted, medical, and related benefits, vocational rehabilitation e xpenses, legal fees, including a separate total of fees paid to attorneys and fees paid for the other costs of litigation, and penalties paid on all claims during the preceding calendar year. If the annual report is timely and complete when received by the division and provides accurate information about each category of payments, the director shall review the timeliness of the insurer's or adjuster's reports filed during the preceding year under (c) of this section. If, during the preceding year, the insur er or adjuster filed at least 99 percent of the reports on time, the penalties assessed under (c) of this section shall be waived.

(o) The director shall promptly notify the division of insurance if the board determines that the employer's insurer has frivolously or unfairly controverted compensation due under this chapter. After receiving notice from the director, the division of insurance shall determine if the insurer has committed an unfair claim settlement practice under AS 21.36.125 . (p) An employer shall pay interest on compensation that is not paid when due. Interest required under this subsection accrues at the rate specified in AS 09.30.070 (a) that is in effect on the date the compensation is due . 373(q) Unless compensation due the employee under this chapter is paid by negotiable instrument that is drawn on a state or federal financial institution, the employer shall increase the weekly rate of compensation due the empl oyee under AS 23.30.175 by two percent. AS 23.30.095. Medical Treatments, Services, and Examinations. (a) The employer shall furnish medical, surgical, and other attendance or treatment, nurse and hospital service, medicine, crutches, and apparatus for the period which the nature of the injury or the process of recovery requires, not exceeding two years from and after the date of injury to the employee. However, if the condition requiring the treatment, apparatus, or medicine is a latent one, the two -year period runs from the time the employee has knowledge of the nature of the employee's disability and its relationship to the employment and after disablement. It shall be additionally provided that, if continued treatment or care or both beyond the two -year period is indicated, the injured employee has the right of review by the board. The board may authorize c ontinued treatment or care or both as the process of recovery may require. When medical care is required, the injured employee may designate a licensed physician to provide all medical and related benefits. The employee may not make more than one change in the employee's choice of attending physician without the written consent of the employer. Referral to a specialist by the employee's attending physician is not considered a change in physicians. Upon procuring the services of a physician, the injured empl oyee shall give proper notification of the selection to the employer within a reasonable time after first being treated. Notice of a change in the attending physician shall be given before the change. (b) If the employee is unable to designate a physician and the emergency nature of the injury requires immediate medical care, or if the employee does not desire to designate a physician and so advises the employer, the employer shall designate the physician. Designation under this subsection, however, does not prevent the employee from subsequently designating a physician for continuance of required medical care. (c) A claim for medical or surgical treatment, or treatment requiring continuing and multiple treatments of a similar nature is not valid and enforceable against the employer unless, within 14 days following treatment, the physician or health care provider giving the treatment or the employee receiving it furnishes to the employer and the board notice of the injury and treatment, preferably on a form prescribed by the board. The board shall, however, excuse the failure to furnish notice within 14 days when it finds it to be in the interest of justice to do so, and it may, upon application by a party in interest, make an award for the reasonable value of the medical or surgical treatment so obtained by the employee. When a claim is made for a course of treatment requiring continuing and multiple treatments of a similar nature, in addition to the notice, the physician or health care provider shall furnish a written treatment plan if the course of treatment will require more frequent outpatient visits than the standard treatment frequency for the nature and degree of the injury and the type of treatments. The treatment plan shall be furnished to the employee and the employer within 14 days after treatment begins. The treatment plan must include objectives, modalities, frequency of treatments, and reasons for the frequency of treatments. If the treatment plan is not furnished as required under this subsectio n, neither the employer nor the employee may be required to pay for treatments that 374exceed the frequency standard. The board shall adopt regulations establishing standards for frequency of treatment. (d) If at any time during the period the employee unrea sonably refuses to submit to medical or surgical treatment, the board may by order suspend the payment of further compensation while the refusal continues, and no compensation may be paid at any time during the period of suspension, unless the circumstance s justified the refusal. (e) The employee shall, after an injury, at reasonable times during the continuance of the disability, if requested by the employer or when ordered by the board, submit to an examination by a physician or surgeon of the employer's choice authorized to practice medicine under the laws of the jurisdiction in which the examination occurs, furnished and paid for by the employer. The employer may not make more than one change in the employer's choice of a physician or surgeon without th e written consent of the employee. Referral to a specialist by the employer's physician is not considered a change in physicians. An examination requested by the employer not less than 14 days after injury, and every 60 days thereafter, shall be presumed to be reasonable, and the employee shall submit to the examination without further request or order by the board. Unless medically appropriate, the physician shall use existing diagnostic data to complete the examination. Facts relative to the injury or cla im communicated to or otherwise learned by a physician or surgeon who may have attended or examined the employee, or who may have been present at an examination are not privileged, either in the hearings provided for in this chapter or an action to recover damages against an employer who is subject to the compensation provisions of this chapter. If an employee refuses to submit to an examination provided for in this section, the employee's rights to compensation shall be suspended until the obstruction or r efusal ceases, and the employee's compensation during the period of suspension may, in the discretion of the board or the court determining an action brought for the recovery of damages under this chapter, be forfeited. The board in any case of death may require an autopsy at the expense of the party requesting the autopsy. An autopsy may not be held without notice first being given to the widow or widower or next of kin if they reside in the state or their whereabouts can be reasonably ascertained, of the time and place of the autopsy and reasonable time and opportunity given the widow or widower or next of kin to have a representative present to witness the autopsy. If adequate notice is not given, the findings from the autopsy may be suppressed on motion made to the board or to the superior court, as the case may be. (f) [Repealed, Sec. 74 Ch 10 FSSLA 2005]. (g) [Repealed, Sec. 27 Ch 93 SLA 1982]. (h) Upon the filing with the division by a party in interest of a claim or other pleading, all parties to the proceeding must immediately, or in any event within five days after service of the pleading, send to the division the original signed reports of all physicians relating to the proceedings that they may have in their possession or under their control, and copies of the reports shall be served by the party immediately on any adverse party. There is a continuing duty on all parties to file and serve all the reports during the pendency of the proceeding. (i) Interference by a person with the selection by an injured employee of an authorized physician to treat the employee, or the improper influencing or attempt by a person to influence a medical opinion of a physician who has treated or examined an injured employee is a misdemeanor. 375(j) The commissioner shall appoint a medical services review committee to assist and advise the department and the board in matters involving the appropriateness, necessity, and cost of medical and related services provided under this chapter. The medical services review committe e shall consist of nine members to be appointed by the commissioner as follows: (1) one member who is a member of the Alaska State Medical Association; (2) one member who is a member of the Alaska Chiropractic Society; (3) one member who is a member of the Alaska State Hospital and Nursing Home Association; (4) one member who is a health care provider, as defined in AS 09.55.560 ; (5) four public members who are not within the definition of \"health care provider\" in AS 09.55.560 ; and (6) one member who is the designee of the commissioner a nd who shall serve as chair. (k) In the event of a medical dispute regarding determinations of causation, medical stability, ability to enter a reemployment plan, degree of impairment, functional capacity, the amount and efficacy of the continuance of or necessity of treatment, or compensability between the employee's attending physician and the employer's independent medical evaluation, the board may require that a second independent medical evaluation be conducted by a physician or physicians selected by the board from a list established and maintained by the board. The cost of an examination and medical report shall be paid by the employer. The report of an independent medical examiner shall be furnished to the board and to the parties within 14 days after the examination is concluded. A person may not seek damages from an independent medical examiner caused by the rendering of an opinion or providing testimony under this subsection, except in the event of fraud or gross incompetence. (l) [Repealed, Sec. 74 Ch 10 FSSLA 2005]. (m) [Repealed, Sec. 74 Ch 10 FSSLA 2005]. (n) A generic drug product must be used when dispensing a drug product to an employee under this chapter unless the prescribing physician provides justification in writing explaining the medical necessity for the name -brand drug product.

One of the r epealed paragraphs, 12 AAC 16.910(b)(2), prohibited the advertising of techniques or modalities to infer or imply superiority of treatment or diagnosis by their use. The other repealed paragraph, 12 AAC 16.910(b)(4), prohibited print advertising claiming superiority over or greater skill than other practitioners. These provisions were both repealed so that the advertising practices previously prohibited would no longer be consi dered \"misrepresentation\" and therefore would be allowed. 458 "}
