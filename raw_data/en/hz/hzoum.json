Very disappointed given the cost of this. The citrus and syrah don't have enough scent to fill a small room, which is disappointing. The grapefruit pomegranate is perfect and smells great! I have been buying Napa soaps for years, love all the scents, using them myself and giving as gifts. I decided to try the Lavender Diffuser and was very disappointed, there was no scent to it at all. The company saw my review and reached out to me. They sent me a bottle so I could pour what I had in and return it to them for quality control. They also sent me a new diffuser in Grapefruit Pomegranate. This one is fabulous! I walk into my bathroom and get that fresh, clean grapefruit scent. Thank You Napa soap for listening to your customers and making us very happy! I BOUGHT A FEW AND LOVED THEM EVERYONE I GAVE ONE TO , LOVED IT !!! This is literally the best diffuser available anywhere! It's lasts (for what seems like) FOREVER! The lavender scent fills the room and is beautiful and just the right amount \u2014 not at all overpowering. I have 2 at home and one in my office at work....love them all! I "}
