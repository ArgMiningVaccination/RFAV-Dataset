Building on previous events held in Washington, DC ( [2015](https://royalsociety.org/news/2015/09/human-gene-editing-summit/)) and Hong Kong ( [2018](https://royalsociety.org/news/2018/05/second-international-summit-on-human-genome-editing-to-be-held-in-hong-kong/)), the London meeting continued the global dialogue on somatic and germline human genome editing. Major themes for discussion included developments in clinical trials and genome editing tools such as CRISPR/Cas9, as well as social, ethical and accessibility considerations these scientific developments entail. The three-day Summit was organised by the Royal Society, the UK Academy of Medical Sciences, the US National Academies of Sciences and Medicine and The World Academy of Sciences. The [Summit's Organising Committee](https://royalsociety.org/news/2021/10/third-international-human-genome-editing-summit-planning-committee/), chaired by Professor Robin Lovell-Badge FMedSci FRS, [released a statemen](https://royalsociety.org/news/2023/03/statement-third-international-summit-human-genome-editing/)t based on the Summit discussions.

The report of a research project aiming to survey, document, catalogue and analyse empirical information regarding regulatory capacity and governance approaches for somatic genome editing research interventions in different countries, which was commissioned ahead of the Summit, is [available to download](/-/media/events/2023/03/human-genome-editing-summit/somatic-genome-editing-governance-approaches-and-regulatory-capacity-in-different-countries.pdf?la=en-GB&hash=4E4A56DA06BD8DB69D2B6E3E6DE49387). Findings from the report were presented by Piers Millett on Wednesday 8 March at the Summit. A recorded presentation on 'CRISPR and Human Genome Editing: Progress & Opportunities' by Jennifer Doudna, Li Ka Shing Chancellor's Chair Professor in the Department of Chemistry and the Department of Molecular and Cell Biology, University of California, Berkeley, USA, is [available to watch](https://youtu.be/FL-iQGV-E2w). A handout for the agenda session on the morning of Wednesday 8 March 'Civil Society and Human Genome Editing: roles and challenges in public engagement' is [available to download](/-/media/events/2023/03/human-genome-editing-summit/roles-and-challenges-in-public-engagement-handout.pdf?la=en-GB&hash=E5CD4391D117440C5E666E66B18EC368). In preparation for the Summit, a three-part series of online events was held in 2022 'Looking Ahead to the Third Human Genome Editing Summit', which focused on scientific developments, equity and access, and governance of human genome editing.
