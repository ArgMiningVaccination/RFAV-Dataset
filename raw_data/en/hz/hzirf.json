At Hanley Center, we are acutely aware of the mind-body connection. Exceptional medical services are central to our programming, and we offer sophisticated healthcare that complements the advanced clinical support and therapy that our patients receive.

Drug and Alcohol Use and the Body Drug and alcohol use affects the body in so many adverse ways, and comprehensive medical treatment is often necessary for healing. Because different substances impact each person in distinctive ways, effective treatment plans must take each patient's individual challenges into account. Our team brings drug or alcohol use and medical history into current focus, and we individually tailor our medical recommendations based on comprehensive evaluations and assessments. In accordance with our age and gender-specific philosophy, we also account for the ways in which age and gender influence the recovery process.

Over the course of addiction, the body learns to rely on drugs or alcohol to produce certain hormones and neurotransmitters, leading to chemical imbalance. Without drugs or alcohol, the body becomes physically unstable, resulting in withdrawal symptoms that can be both uncomfortable and dangerous. Detox is the process during which a patient moves through withdrawal toward normalized brain and body function. Medical detox at Hanley Center is overseen by doctors, nurses, and other medical professionals who provide compassionate care as all traces of drugs or alcohol leave the body. This approach ensures that our patients are as comfortable as possible and protected from health complications while withdrawal symptoms appear. We utilize safe medications, alternative interventions, and careful nutritional planning to keep symptoms under control. Our 24/7 nursing team provides round-the-clock monitoring to ensure safety and well-being. Integrated Treatment with Caring Providers Medical conditions occurring alongside addiction need to be treated at the same time as addiction, in the same place, with the same treatment team. Our multidisciplinary providers include skilled nurses, psychiatrists, and other medical doctors, all of whom have extensive addiction treatment experience. Our dedicated medical professionals keep a close eye on patients as they move through detox and residential levels of care, and respond with new treatments, as needed. Every continuing care plan also includes recommendations for ongoing medical care and a focus on self-care practices related to health and wellness.
