COVID-19 vaccination is recommended for everyone ages 6 months and older in the United States for the prevention of COVID-19. There is currently no FDA-authorized COVID-19 vaccine for children younger than age 6 months. CDC recommends that people stay [up to date](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/stay-up-to-date.html) with COVID-19 vaccination. I have already been vaccinated against COVID-19, do I need a booster dose? The virus that causes COVID-19 has changed over time. The different versions of the virus that have developed over time are called variants. The first COVID-19 vaccines are called \"monovalent\" because they were designed to protect against the original variant of virus that causes COVID-19. However, two COVID-19 vaccine manufacturers, Pfizer and Moderna, have developed updated COVID-19 vaccines. The updated vaccines are called \"bivalent\" because they protect against both the original virus that causes COVID-19 and the newer variants, such as Omicron variants. The newer bivalent vaccines provide greater protection from COVID- 19 than the original monovalent vaccines. CDC recommends that all people ages 6 months and older receive at least 1 bivalent (updated) mRNA COVID-19 vaccine. This may be called a booster if you have had prior monovalent vaccination. Can I still get the older, monovalent vaccine? The monovalent formulations of the two mRNA COVID-19 vaccines are no longer available and should no longer be used for COVID-19 vaccination. When and where can I get the updated bivalent vaccine or booster? Updated bivalent vaccines and boosters are widely available , including at doctor's offices, hospitals, pharmacies, and community health clinics. Am I fully vaccinated without if I have not had an updated (bivalent)booster? You are not considered fully vaccinated or up to date with COVID-19 vaccination if you have not had a bivalent (updated) COVID-19 vaccine. Are COVID-19 vaccinations and boosters free? Yes, vaccination is free. You do not need to pay, have ID, or have health insurance to get a booster. Do I need to be a Massachusetts resident to get a booster? What if I lived somewhere else when I got my initial COVID-19 vaccine doses? You can get aCOVID-19 vaccination or booster in Massachusetts if you live, work or study here. What if I don't know when I received my last COVID-19 vaccine shot or what type it was? To learn whether you need an updated booster dose, you should consult your primary care provider or the retail pharmacy where you were first vaccinated. If that is not possible, learn how to obtain your vaccination record by visiting [www.mass.gov/myvaxrecord](/myvaxrecord). If I have already had COVID, should I still get vaccinated or get a booster? Yes. Getting a COVID-19 vaccine or booster gives most people a high level of protection against COVID-19 even in people who have already been sick with COVID-19. After having COVID, how long do I need to wait to get vaccinated or boosted? You should wait until your 10-day period of isolation is over and any symptoms have improved.
