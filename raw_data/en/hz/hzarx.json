I am learning each and every day to manage the complicated energies that affect my relationships with others and myself. Truly life changing, HWR helps me navigate life with more grace and ease, in a way I never knew was possible! Carolyn and Jana have created a safe space for soul growth that allows its members to plug in at any level of the awareness journey. HWR is an integral and invaluable part of my everyday life. Andrea Crawford, Knoxville, TN The content is relevant to my overall healing and the music is absolutely amazing. I typically start my day with one of the meditaions, and there are plenty to select from, depending on my mood. The mindfulness practices shared are a reminder of how we can successfully manage our day to day life to the fullest extent. Thank you so much Carolyn, Jana, and Team for sharing your talents! Cindy Tysinger, Founder of Regenrus, Denton, TX Marisa Gutmacher Carolyn and Jana's multi sensory modules have helped me gain a deeper understanding of myself, my spiritual path and the source of energy that emanates from each of us. Being able to pause, even just for a few moments, to reconnect into that place of stillness has been transformative. "}
