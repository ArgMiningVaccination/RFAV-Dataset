It aims to support contractors to deliver good quality care . Changes to QOF are agreed as part of wider changes to th e GMS contract which are negotiated by NHS England and the British Medical Association 's (BMA) General Practitioners Committee (GPC) England . In January 2019, NHS England agreed a new five -year framework for GP contract reform to implement The NHS Long Te rm Plan1. This included a number of improvements to QOF in line with the recommendations of the QOF Review (published in July 2018)2. Summary of changes for 2019/20 A number of changes have been agreed for 2019/20 in order to begin to implement the recommendations of the Report of the QOF Review2. These include: the retirement of 28 indicators (worth 175 points) which are either no longer in line with NICE guidance, have known measurement issues (usually because of low numbers at a practice level) or where the care described is now viewed as a core professional responsibility. the introduction of 15 new indicators (worth 101 points) to bring QOF into closer alignment with NICE guidance and Screening Committee recommendations , mainly on diabetes, bloo d pressure control and cervical screening . The rationale and changes to requirements are detailed in the appropriate clinical domain in Sections 3 and 4 of this document . Exception reporting has been replaced with a Personalised Care Adjustment which will better reflect individual clinical situations and patients' wishes. Detail of the criteria for this and the associated recording requirements is in Section 6. the introduction of a new QOF Quality Improvement (QI) domain (worth 74 points). The first two m odules will be prescribing safety and end -of-life care (EoLC) . These topics are anticipated to change on annual basis. The changes are explained in Section 5. The size of QOF remains unchanged at 559 points. The value of a QOF point in 2019/20 will be \u00a3 187.74 and the national average practice population figure will be 8,479. There are no changes to payment thresholds for indicators carried forward from 2018/19. 1 NHS England. The long term plan. https://www.england.nhs.uk/wp -content/uploads/2019/01/gp - contract pb-04-07-2018 -qof-report.pdf 7 Purpose of this document The aim of this document is to provide additional guidance on the interpretation and verification of the QOF indicators for 2019/20 in England, which are listed in Annex D of the Statement of Financial Entitlements Directions (SFE)3. It is effective from 1 April 201 9 and replaces ver sions issued in previous years. This document covers: Section 2: list of QOF indicators as detailed in Annex D of the SFE Directions Sectio n 3: specific information about each clinical indicator including the rationale for inclusion and any specific requirements which contractors need to demo nstrate to ensure achievement. Section 4: specific information about each public health indicator including the rationale for inclusion and any specific requirements which contractors need to demonstrate to ensure achievement Section 5: detailed informati on about the requirements of contracts in relation to the quality improvement domain Section 6: detailed information about the new Personalised Care Adjustment Section 7: full list of indicators which are no longer in QOF but are subject to ongoing data co llection Section 8: process for raising queries in relation to QOF indicators and their interpretation Section 9: glossary of acronyms Section 10: summary of clinical and public health indicator changes for 2019/20 . It should be read in conjunction with th e SFE Directions and Business Rules4. Definition of 'commissioner' The NHS C ommissioning Board (NHS CB) is the organisation legally responsible for the commissioning of primary care in England , which operates under the name NHS England . NHS England is used throughout this guidance, except where it is necessary to use NHS CB to reflect the SFE Directions. Following the implementation of co -commissioning arrangements references to 'commissioners' in this document could refer to NHS England or a clinical commi ssioning group (CCG). Additional indicator information Full descriptions of each indicator, its rationale for inclusion and any specific criteria for reporting and verification are detailed in Sections 3, 4 and 5. 3 https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/nhs -primary -medical -services -directions and public health indicators Clinical and public health indicators are organised by disease or intervention categories. These indicators have been selected as they represent care where: The responsibility for ongoing management rests principally with the contractor and the primary care team There is good evidence of the health benefits likely to result from improved primary care . A summary of the indicators for each disease/ intervention category is provided at the beginning of each disease/ intervention section. The rationale section fo r each indicator may link to relevant guidelines for further information. This will be to the guideline which was used to underpin indicator development. Indicator numbering Indicators are prefixed with an abbreviation of the category to which they belong. For example, coronary heart disease indicator one i s identified as CHD001. Indicator IDs are unique to each indicator and are not reused. New indicators will be given the next available unused number. Therefore, this may not flow sequentially from the existing indicator IDs. Similarly, where there has been a change to indicator wording, activity timescales or significant changes to coding or the data extraction logic these indicators will be given a new unique ID. This is to ensure that indicators are not inappropriately compared to those in previous years and to avoid any confusion which could arise from re -using ID numbers . Where an indicator has been developed through the NICE led process5 they will also be annotated with their NICE menu ID number (NICE [year] menu ID: NMXX). If a NICE developed indicator has been amended during negotiations this will be annotated with 'based on NICE [year] menu ID: NMXX'. Identifying the target population or disease register Clinical indicators all have a defined target population. This may be defined within a register indicator or as part of the business rules. This target population will be identified either by the presence of predetermined clinical diagnosis codes in the patient record or by using other attributes of the patient such as age and sex. For example, the target population for cervical screening is constructed using age and sex to determine inclusion in the denominator for each indicator. Where the target population is identified using clinical codes the con tractor is responsible for demonstrating that it has systems in place to maintain a high quality, accurate register. This may be verified by the commissioner and contractors may be asked to explain reasons for variation from expected prevalence levels. Con tractors are reminded that QOF registers must not be used as the sole input for the purposes of patient care and clinical audit. There may be patients for whom a treatment or activity is clinically appropriate but they may not meet the criteria as defined by the QOF register. Contractors are reminded of this when developing their Patients with co -morbidities will be included in all relevant target populations and registers where they meet the defined criteria. Where a patient is in more than one target population then they are eligible for the interventions outlined in all the relevant disease areas. Some indicators refer to a sub -set of patients in the target population or register. Patients who are not included in an indicator denomina tor for definitional reasons are classified as 'exclusions' and are automatically identified through the business rules and removed from the denominator. Patients are eligible for the interventions outlined in QOF indicators as soon as they are fully regis tered with the contractor or a relevant diagnosis is recorded. Quality improvement indicators Section 5 provides detailed guidance on the interpretation of the quality improvement indicators and the aims and objectives which their quality improvement plans should be seeking to address. Reporting, payment calculation and verification Reporting Reporting requirements and the rules for the calculation of QOF points and their payment are set out in the SFE. For most indicators anonymised data will be collected automatically from GP clinical systems by the General Practice Extraction Service (GPES) and reported to Calculating Quality Reporting Service (CQRS). The clinical codes and logical extraction sequence used in this data collection is defined in a series of technical documents - the Business Rules. These are based entirely on SNOMED codes ( Read version 2 and Clinical Terms Version 3 (CTV3) were used in QOF up to and including 2017/18) and associated dates. SNOMED codes are an NHS standard. Contractors usin g proprietary coding systems and/or local/practice specific codes will need to be aware that these codes will not be recognised within QOF reporting. The Business Rules are updated twice yearly around April and October and are available on the NHS Digital website6. For indicators where achievement is not automatically collected this should be self - declared through the CQR S web-based server. Commissioners may request the evidence underpinning this self -declaration as part of their verification processes. Payment calculation and achievement CQRS will calculate achievement and payments for QOF as set out in the SFE and report to commissioners and practices . Whilst full details of the achievement calculations are detailed in the SFE, the following key points are useful to note : Achievement is measured on the last day of the financial year i.e. 31 March in respect of patients registered with the practice on that date. Whilst estimates of 6 NHS Digital. http://content.digital.nhs.uk/qofesextractspecs 10 achievement may be made through the year these may not accurately predict final performance. The time -period referred to in an indicator is calculated by counting back from the last day of the financial year. Time periods vary between indicators The phrase 'currently treated' should be interpreted as a prescription for the specifi ed medication being given in the six months preceding the last day of the financial year i.e. between 1 October and 31 March Some indicators require the intervention to be offered to patients when they reach a defined age or within a specified time before and/or after diagnosis. Care recorded outside of these time periods will not be recognised in the QOF achievement calculation. There are specific provisions within the SFE which describe the calculations to be made where a contract comes to an end before t he last day of the financial year. Verification The contractor must ensure that it is able to provide any information that the NHS CB or commissioner may reasonably request of it to demonstrate that it is entitled to each achievement point to which it says it is entitled . The contractor must make that information available to the commissioner on request. In verifying that an indicator has been achieved and information correctly recorded, the commissioner may choose to inspect the output from a computer search that has been used to provide information on the indicator, or a sample of patient records relevant to the indicator. Commissioners and practices will be aware of the requirements of access to patient identifiable data. Where patients have expressed a desire that their information is not shared for this purpose, practices will need to advise the commissioner and make an appropriate note in the recor d. Commissioners and practices will be aware of the need to: obtain the minimum necessary information for the specific purpose anonymise data where possible . It is recommended that practices record access to confidential patient data in the relevant patie nt record, so that an audit trail is in place to fulfil the obligations of the practice towards their patients and that of commissioners to practices. The terms 'notes' and 'patient record' are used to indicate either electronic or paper patient records. Disputes When a QOF related contractual dispute arises, the commissioner and the contractor, would be expected to make every reasonable effort to communicate and co-operate with each other with a view to resolving the dispute without the need to refer it for formal deter mination by NHS Resolution (Primary Care Appeals) (or in certain cases, the courts). Further information is available in the SFE. 11 Section 2: Summary of all indicators7 Section 2.1: Clinical domain (379 points) Section 2.1. applies to all contractors participating in QOF.

Remission from serious mental illness Making an accurate diagnosis of remission can be challenging. In the absence of strong evidence of what constitutes 'remission' from serious mental illness, clinicians should only consider using the se codes if the patient has been in remission for at least five years, that is where there is: no record of anti -psychotic medicatio n no mental health in -patient episodes; and no secondary or community care mental health follow -up for at least five years. Where a patient is recorded as being 'in remission' they remain on the MH001 register (in case the ir condition relapses at a later date) but they are excluded from the denominator for indicators MH002, MH003, and MH00 6. The accuracy of this coding should be reviewed on an annual basis by a clinician. Should a patient who has been coded as 'in remission ' experience a relapse then this should be recorded as such in their patient record. In the event that a patient experiences a relapse and is coded as such, they will again be included in all the associated indicators for schizophrenia, bipolar affective disorder and other psychoses and their care plan should be updated. Where a patient has relapsed after being recorded as being in remission, their care plan should be updated subsequent to the relapse. Care plans dated prior to the date of the relapse will not be acceptable for QOF purposes. Cancer (CAN) Indicator Points Achievement thresholds Records CAN001.

The percentage of patients with any or any combination of the following conditions: CHD, PAD, stroke or TIA, hypertension, diabetes, COPD, CKD, asthma, schizophrenia, bipolar affective disorder or other psychoses who are recorded as current smokers who have a record of an offer of support and treatment within the preceding 12 months NICE 2011 menu ID: NM39 25 56-96% Disease register for smoking The disease register for the purpose of calculating the APDF for SMOK002 and SMOK005 is defined as the sum of the number of patients on the disease registers for each of the conditions listed in the indicators. Any patient who has one or more co-morbidities e .g. diabetes and CHD, is only counted once on the register for SMOK002 and SMOK005. There is no APDF calculation for SMOK004. Requirements for recording smoking status Smokers For patients who smoke this recording should be made in the preceding 12 months for SMOK002. Non-smokers It is recognised that life -long non -smokers are very unlikely to start smoking and indeed find it quite irritating to be asked repeatedly regarding their smoking status. Smoking status for this group of patients should be recorded in the preceding 12 month s for SMOK002 until the end of the financial year in which the patient reaches 23 the age of 25. Once a patient is over the age of 25 years ( e.g. in the financial year in which they reach the age of 26 or in any year following that financial year) to be class ified as a non-smoker they should be recorded as: never smoked which is both after their 25th birthday and after the earliest diagnosis date for the disease which led to the patients inclusion on the SMOK002 register (e .g. one of the conditions listed on t he SMOK002 register). Ex-smokers Ex-smokers can be recorded as such in the preceding 12 months for SMOK002. Practices may choose to record ex -smoking status on an annual basis for three consecutive financial years and after that smoking status need only be recorded if there is a change. This is to recognise that once a patient has been an ex -smoker for more than three years they are unlikely to restart.

Men are more commonly affected than women and the prevalence increases with age with prevalence in those over 65 years 7.2 per cent and over 75 years ten per cent8. In people who have had a stroke , concurrent AF is associated with a higher rate of mortality, greater disability, a longer stay in hospital and a lower rate of discharge home9. AF indicator 001 The contractor establishes and maintains a register of patients with atrial fibrillation AF001.1 Rationale The register includes all patients with an initial event; paroxysmal; persistent and permanent AF. AF 001.2 Reporting and verification See indicator wording for requirement criteria. Where a patient has been diagnosed with AF and been sub sequently successfully treated, if there is an 'AF resolved code' present in their record after the latest AF recording, they will be removed from the register. 8 NICE CG180.

The Framingham Study. 26 AF may resolve in some specific and limited situation s. Contractors should also note that patients who have been recorded with AF resolved, continue to be at an increased risk of stroke compared to patien ts who have never had an episode of AF10. Contractors should consider the implications of this for individual patients before using the AF resolved code . AF indicator 006 (NICE 2014 menu ID: NM81) The percentage of patients with atrial fibrillation in whom stroke risk has been assessed using CHA 2DS2-VAS c score risk stratification scoring system in the preceding 12 months (excluding those patients with a previous CHADS 2 or CHA 2DS2-VAS c score of 2 or more) AF 006.1 Rationale The NICE guideline on atrial fibrillation11 recommends that people with symptomatic or asymptomatic paroxysmal, persistent or permanent AF, atrial flutter and/or a continuing risk of arrhythmia recurrence after cardioversion back to sinus rhythm should have an assessment of their stroke risk using the CHA 2DS2-VAS c risk assessm ent tool. The CHA 2DS2-VAS c is a refinement of CHADS 2. The revised CHA 2DS2-VAS c system scores one point, up to a maximum of nine, for each of the following risk factors (except previous stroke or TIA, or age 75 which scores dou ble, hence the '2'): C: congestive HF (one point) H: hypertension (one point ) A2: age 75 or over (two points) D: diabetes mellitus (one point) S2: previous stroke or TIA or thromboembolism (two points) V: vascular disease ( e.g. PAD, MI, aortic plaque) (on e point) A: age 65 -74 years (one point) Sc: sex category ( i.e. female sex) (one point) AF 006.2 Reporting and verification See indicator wo rding for requirement criteria. Stroke risk assessment should be repeated on an annual basis unless the patient has previously scored 2 or more using either CHA 2DS2-VAS c at any time, or CHADS 2 prior to 1 April 2015 . AF indicator 007 (NICE 2015 menu ID: NM82) In those patients with atrial fibrillation with a record of a CHA 2DS2-VAS c score of 2 or more, the percentage of patients who are currently treated with anti-coagulation drug therapy AF 007.1 Rationale 10 Adderley et al. ris k of stroke and TIA in patients with a diagnosis of resolved AF: retrospective cohort studies. BMJ 2018;360:k1717 http://dx.doi.org/10.1136/bmj.k1717 11 NICE. CG180. AF. 2014 https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/cg180 27 This indicator aims to support the identification of people with AF who are at increased risk of stroke so that they may be offered anti-coagulation drug therapy. Around 980,000 people in England are known to be at risk of stroke from AF12, though it is estimated an additional 440,000 may be at -risk13. Of these, around three - quarters are taking anti -coagulants in primary care. However, around 60 per cent of people ad mitted to a hospital with a stroke with preceding AF are not taking the recommended anti -coagulant medication14. NICE estimates that with effective detection and protection with anti -coagulant drugs, 7,000 strokes and 2,000 premature deaths could be avoided each year15. All patients with AF and a CHA 2DS2-VAS c score of two or above should be offered anti-coagulation therapy taking the ir bleeding risk into account. A CHA 2DS2-VAS c score of one in women (women under age 65 with no other risk factors) should be regarded as low risk and should not receive anti -coagulation. Men with a CHA 2DS2- VAS c score of one should be regarded as at intermediate risk and a group in whom anti-coagulat ion should be considered. Anti-coagulation may be with apixaban, etexilate, rivarox aban, edoxaban or a vitamin K antagonist. Practices should not offer aspirin monotherapy solely for stroke prevention to people with AF. Aspirin is not as effecti ve as anti -coagulants at preventing stroke in people with AF who are at increased risk of stroke and is also not as safe in terms of causing bleeding. Although the risks of anti -coagulation also increase with age, the evidence also shows that its benefits outweigh the risks in the vast majority of people with AF. NICE provide a patient decision aid16 to support discussions with patients as to the risks and benefits of taking anticoagulants. AF 007.2 Reporting and verification See indicator wo rding for requ irement criteria. The Business Rules will look for the latest CHA 2DS2-VAS c score in the patient record and if the score is equal to, or greater than two, the patient will be included in the denominator. If the patient does not have a CHA 2DS2-VAS c score, bu t does have a CHADS 2 score of greater than, or equal to two recorded before 1 April 2015, they will be included in the denominator. 12 NHS Digital.

The percentage of patients aged 80 years and over with coronary heart disease in whom the last blood pressure reading (measured in the preceding 12 months) is 150/90 mmHg or less Based on NICE 2009 menu ID: NM86 5 46-86% CHD - rationale for inclusion o f indicator set CHD is the single most common cause of premature death in the UK. The research evidence relating to the management of CHD is well established and if implemented can reduce the risk of death from CHD and improve the quality of life for patients. This indica tor set focuses on the management of patients with established CHD. CHD indicator 001 (NICE 2015 menu ID: NM86) The contractor establishes and maintains a register of patients with coronary heart disease CHD 001.1 Rationale The register includes all patie nts who have had coronary artery revascularisation procedures, such as coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). Patients with Cardiac Syndrome X are not included on the CHD register. Cont ractors should record those with a history of myocardial infarction ( MI) as well as those with a history of CHD.

The contractor establishes and maintains a register of patients with heart failure 4 Initial diagnosis HF002. The percentage of patients with a diagnosis of heart failure (diagnosed on or after 1 April 2006) which has been confirmed by an echocardiogram or by specialist assessment 3 months before or 12 months after entering on to the register NICE 201 5 menu ID: NM 116 6 50-90% Ongoing management HF003. In those patients with a current diagnosis of heart failure due to left ventricular systolic dysfunction, the percentage of patients who are currently treated with an ACE -I or ARB NICE 201 5 menu ID: NM8 9 10 60-100% HF004. In those patients with a current diagnosis of heart failure due to left ventricular systolic dysfunction who are currently treated with an ACE- I or ARB, the percentage of patients who are additionally currently treated with a beta -blocker licensed for heart failure NICE 201 5 menu ID: NM 90 9 40-65% HF - rationale for inclusion of indicator set HF represents the only major cardiovascular disease with increasing prevalence and carries a poor prognosis for patients. This indicator set refers to all patients with HF unless specified otherwise. 31 HF indicator 001 The contractor establishes and maintains a register of patients with heart failure HF 001.1 Rationale All patients with a diagnosis of HF, are included on the register. HF 001.2 Reporting and verification See indicator wording for requirement criteria. There are two disease registers used for the purpose of calculating APDF for t he HF indicators: 1. a register of patients with HF is used to calculate APDF for HF001 and HF002. 2. a register of patients with HF due to left ventricular systolic dysfunction (LVSD) is used to calculate APDF for HF003 and HF004. Register 1. is defined in indi cator HF001. Register 2. is a sub -set of register 1. and is composed of patients with a diagnostic code for LVSD as well as HF. HF indicator 002 (NICE 2015 menu ID: NM116) The percentage of patients with a diagnosis of heart failure (diagnosed on or after 1 April 2006) which has been confirmed by an echocardiogram or by specialist assessment 3 months before or 12 months after entering on to the register HF 002.1 Rationale This indicator requires that all patients with suspected HF have further specialist investigation (such as echocardiography) or specialist assessment . Specialists may include GPs identified by NHS England as having a special interest in HF. Many HF patients will be diagnosed following specialist referral or during hospital admission and som e will also have their diagnosis confirmed by tests such as cardiac scintography or angiography rather than echocardiography. NICE N-terminal pro -B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) measurement to guide the urgency of refer ral for echocardiogram and specialist assessment . Patients with suspected HF who have very high levels of NT- pro-BNP require urgent referral for specialist assessment and transthoracic echocardiography (within 2 weeks) due to their poor prognosis. HF 002.2 Reporting and verification See indicator wording for requirement criteria. For measurement purposes, three months before the date of diagnosis is defined as 93 days.

Chronic heart failure in adults . 2011, updated 2018. http://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/qs9 32 ACE-I or ARB HF 003.1 Rationale There is strong clinical and cost -effectiveness evidence to support the use of ACE -I in all patien ts with HF with LVSD. ACE -I improve symptoms, reduce the hospitalisation rate and improve the survival rate. This is applicable in all age groups. It is possible to have a diagnosis of LVSD without HF, for example, asymptomatic people who might be identif ied coincidently but who are at high risk of developing subsequent HF. In such cases, ACE -I's delay the onset of symptomatic HF, reduce cardiovascular events and improve long -term survival. This indicator only applies to patients with HF and therefore excl udes this other group of patients who are nevertheless to be considered for treatment with ACE -I. NICE NG106 recommend s ACE-I is used as first -line therapy in all patients with HF due to LVSD and that ARBs are used only in patients who are intolerant of ACE -I. HF 003.2 Reporting and verification See indicator wording for requirement criteria. HF indicator 004 (NICE 2015 me nu ID: NM90) In those patients with a current diagnosis of heart failure due to left ventricular systolic dysfunction who are currently treated with an ACE -I or ARB, the percentage of patients who are additionally currently treated with a beta -blocker lice nsed for heart failure HF 004.1 Rationale The NICE guideline for chronic heart failure22 recommend s that beta -blockers licensed for HF are used as first -line therapy in all patients with HF due to LVSD. It also recommends that treatment with beta-blockers is not withheld solely because of age or the presence of peripheral vascular disease (PVD), erectile dysfunction (ED), DM, interstitial pulmonary disease and COPD without reversibility. The only co - morbidities with a clear contra -indication to beta -blocker use are those with asthma and reversible airways obstruction (these groups were excluded from clinical trials). The British National Formulary (BNF) states that \"the beta -blockers bisoprolol and carvedilol are of value in any grade of stable HF and LVSD; n ebivolol is licensed for stable mild to moderate HF in patients aged over 70, beta -blocker treatment should be initiated at a very low dose and titrated very slowly over a period of weeks or months by those experienced in the management of HF. Symptoms may deteriorate initially, calling for adjustment of concomitant therapy\"23. Contractors are advised that patients already prescribed an unlicensed beta -blocker prior to diagnosis of HF due to LVSD do not have their drug therapy changed to meet the criteria of this indicator. Those patients already prescribed an unlicensed beta-blocker will be excluded from the indicator denominator . 22 NICE. NG106.

Patients prescribed a beta -blocker unlicensed for heart failure before being given a diagnosis of heart failure will be excluded from this indicator. Hypertension (HYP) Indicator Points Achievement thresholds Records HYP001. The contractor establishes and maintains a register of patients with established hypertension 6 Ongoing management HYP003. The percentage of patients aged 79 years or under with hypertension in whom the last blood pressure reading (measured in the preceding 12 months) is 140/90 mmHg or less NICE 2012 menu ID: NM53 14 40-77% HYP007 . The percentage of patients aged 80 years and over with hypertension in whom the last blood pressure reading (measured in the preceding 12 months) is 150/90 mmHg or less NICE 2012 menu ID: NM54 5 40-80% HYP - rationale for inclusion of ind icator set Hypertension is a common medical condition which is largely managed in primary care and represents a significant workload for GPs and the primary care team. Trials of anti -hypertensive treatment have confirmed a significant reduction in the inci dence of stroke and CHD in patients with treated hypertension. HYP indicator 001 The contractor establishes and maintains a register of patients with established hypertension HYP 001.1 Rationale Effective treatment of hypertension aims to reduce the risk o f cardiovascular problems such as heart attacks and strokes. Patients who have had one -off high blood pressure readings and women who have been hypertensive in pregnancy should not be included in the register . NICE CG12724 uses the following definitions: Stage 1 hypertension Clinic blood pressure is 140/90 mmHg or higher and subsequent ambulatory blood 24 NICE CG127. Hypertension in adults: diagnosis and management . 2016. https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/CG127 34 pressure monitoring (ABPM) daytime average or home blood pressure monitoring (HBPM) average blood pressure is 135/85 mmHg or higher. Stage 2 hypertension Clinic blood pressure is 160/100 mmHg or higher and subsequent ABPM daytime average or HBPM average blood pressure is 150/95 mmHg or higher. Severe hypertension Clinic systolic blood pressure is 180 mmHg or higher or clinic diastolic blood pressure is 110 mm Hg or higher. The NICE guideline for hypertension25 recommends the use of ABPM to confirm a diagnosis of hypertension, particularly if a clinic blood pressure reading is 140/90 mmHg or higher. If a person is unable to tolerate ABPM, HBPM is a suitable alternative to confirm a diagnosis of hypertension. For patients aged 39 or under with stage 1 hypertension and no evidence of target organ damage, CVD, renal disease or diabetes, NICE recommend that practitioners consider seeking specialist evaluation of secon dary causes of hypertension and a more detailed assessment of potential target organ damage. This is because 10 -year cardiovascular risk assessments can underestimate the lifetime risk of cardiovascular events in these patients. HYP 001.2 Reporting and ver ification See indicator wording for requirement criteria. The contractor may be required by commissioners to discuss their plans for ensuring that new diagnoses are confirmed using ABPM or HBPM as appropriate. HYP indicator 003 (NICE 2012 menu ID: NM53 ) The percentage of patients aged 79 years or under with hypertension in whom the last blood pressure reading (measured in the preceding 12 months) is 140/90 mmHg or less HYP003.1 Rationale This indicator measures the intermediate outcome of a blood pressure of 140/90 mmHg or less in people aged 79 years or under with hypertension. Its intent is to promote the primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease through satisfactory blo od pressure control. The intermediate outcome can be achieved through lifestyle advice or the use of drug therapy. HYP003.2 Reporting and verification See indicator wording for requirement criteria. HYP indicator 007 (NICE 2012 menu ID: NM54) The percenta ge of patients aged 80 years and over with hypertension in whom the last blood pressure reading (measured in the preceding 12 months) is 150/90 mmHg 25 NICE CG127. Hypertension. 2016. https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/cg127 35 or less HYP007 .1 Rationale The NICE guideline for hypertension26 recommends that patients aged 80 years and over with hypertension should be treated to a target blood pressure of 150/90 mmHg or less. It also recommends that this group of patients should be offered the same antihypertensive drug treatment as people aged 55 -80 years, taking into account any co-morbidities. Where people have had a lower treatment target before the age of 80 years their treatment should continue and not be adjusted or back titrated. There is an important distinction between continuing long term and well tolerated treatment in people aged 80 years and older, and starting blood pressure lowering therapy at this age. HYP007 .2 Reporting and verification See indicator wording for requirement criteria. Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) Indicator Points Achievement thresholds Records PAD001. The contractor establishes and maintains a register of patients with peripheral arterial disease NICE 2011 menu ID: NM32 2 PAD - rationale for inclusion of indicator set PAD is one of the three main categories of CVD and patients with PAD, including those who are asymptomatic, have an increased risk of mortality from CVD due to MI and stroke. The relative risks of all -cause mortality are two to three times that of age and sex matched to groups without PAD. Treatment of PAD focuses on cardiov ascular risk factor management. Smoking is a very important risk factor for PAD and management of PAD includes smoking cessation (see smoking indicator set). Other established risk factors are high blood pressure and diabetes. This would mean that patients with PAD and high blood pressure would also be included in the hypertension indicator set and patients with diabetes and PAD would also be included in the diabetes indicator set. Further information NICE CG147. PAD: diagnosis and management . 2012. https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/cg147 PAD indicator 001 (NICE 2011 menu ID: NM32) The contractor establishes and maintains a register of patients with peripheral arterial disease 26 NICE CG127. Hypertension. 2016. https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/cg127 36 PAD 001.1 Rationale Patients with PAD may have symptoms, but can also be asymptomatic. About 20 per cent of patients aged 60 or over have PAD, although only a quarter of these patients have symptoms. Symptoms become severe and progressive in approximately 20 per cent of patient s with symptomatic PAD. Reduced ankle brachial pressure index is an independent predictor of cardiac and cerebrovascular morbidity and mortality and may help to identify patients who would benefit from secondary prevention. PAD 001.2 Reporting and verifica tion See indicator wording for requirement criteria. Stroke and TIA (STIA) Indicator Points Achievement thresholds Records STIA001. The contractor establishes and maintains a register of patients with stroke or TIA 2 Ongoing management STIA007. The percentage of patients with a stroke shown to be non -haemorrhagic, or a history of TIA, who have a record in the preceding 12 months that an anti -platelet agent, or an anti -coagulant is being taken NICE 2015 menu ID: NM94 4 57-97% STIA009. The percentage of patients with stroke or TIA who have had influenza immunisation in the preceding 1 August to 31 March NICE 2015 menu ID: NM140 2 55-95% STIA010 . The percentage of patients aged 79 years or less with a history of stroke or TIA in whom the las t blood pressure reading (measured in the preceding 12 months) is 140/90 mmHg or less NICE 2013 menu ID: NM69 3 40-73% STIA011 . The percentage of patients aged 80 years and over with a history of stroke or TIA in whom the last blood pressure reading (measured in the preceding 12 months) is 150/90 mmHg or less Based on NICE 20 15 menu ID: NM93 2 46-86% STIA - rationale for inclusion of indicator set Stroke is the third most common cause of death in the developed world. One quarter of stroke deaths occur under the age of 65. There is evidence that appropriate diagnosis and management can improve outcomes. 37 STIA indicator 001 The contractor establishes and maintains a register of patients with stroke or TIA STIA 001.1 Rationale For patients diagnosed prior to 1 April 2003 it is accepted that various diagnostic criteria may have been used. For this reason, the presence of the diagnosis of stroke or TIA in the record will be acceptable. Generally, patients with a diagnosis of transient global amnesia or vertebra -basilar insufficiency are not included in the retrospective register. However, contractors may wish to review patients previously diagnosed and if appropriate attempt to confirm the diagnosis. It is up to the contractor to decide, on clinical grounds, when to include a patient on the register eg when a 'dizzy spell' becomes a TIA. Patient records coded with 'Amaurosis fugax', but without a code for TIA are excluded from the register. STIA 001.2 Reporting and verification See indicator wording for requirement criteria. STIA indicator 007 (NICE 2015 menu ID: NM94) The percentage of patients with a stroke shown to be non -haemorrhagic, or a history of TIA, who have a record in the preceding 12 months that an anti -platelet agent, or an anti -coagulant is being taken STIA 007.1 Rationale Long -term anti -platelet therapy reduces the risk of serious vascular events following a stroke by about a quarter. It is advised that anti -platelet therapy is prescribed for the secondary prevention of recurrent stroke and other vascular events in patients who have sustained an ischaemic cerebrovascular event.

There is no requirement for the contractor to carry out all of these items but it is the contractor's responsibility to ensure that they ha ve been done. DM indicator 017 (NICE 2011 menu ID: NM41 ) The contractor establishes and maintains a register of all patients aged 17 or over with diabetes mellitus which specifies the type of diabetes where a diagnosis has been confirmed DM 017.1 Rationale A greater understanding and knowledge of the complexities of diabetes has led to increasing difficulty in accurately diagnosing or classifying the type of diabetes. In March 2011, a report by the Royal College of General Practitioners (RCGP) and NHS Diabe tes was published which examined the issue of coding, classification and diagnosis of diabetes in primary care in England32. The summary findings of the report included an algorithm to provide guidance to healthcare professionals on making a new diagnosis o f diabetes. In line with this report, the diabetes register indicator includes all types of diabetes within the proposed algorithm. Women with gestational diabetes are excluded from this indicator set. If it is too early in the clinical course to diagnose the specific type of diabetes, or if the specific diagnosis is uncertain, contractors are asked to use the parent term 'diabetes mellitus'. Contractors are expected to update these patients' records when their specific type of diabetes is confirmed. This i s advised to be within six to 12 months of the initial diagnosis of diabetes mellitus. This indicator does not specify how the diagnosis is made and a record of the diagnosis will, for the purposes of the QOF, be regarded as sufficient evidence of diabetes . However, there are a substantial number of patients with diabetes who remain undiagnosed and also a number of patients receiving treatment with an incorrect diagnosis of diabetes. Contractors are therefore encouraged to adopt a systematic approach to the diagnosis of diabetes. The World Health Organisation (WHO) 200633 states that fasting plasma glucose 7.0 mmol/l (126 mg/dl) or 2 -h plasma glucose 11.1 mmol/l (200 mg/dl) is used as criteria for diagnosing diabetes. In 2011 an addendum to the 2006 WHO dia gnostic criteria was published to allow the use of glycated haemoglobin ( HbA1c) in diagnosing DM34. The addendum does not invalidate the 2006 recommendations on the use of plasma glucose measurements to diagnose diabetes. The WHO recommend that HbA1c can be used as a diagnostic test for diabetes, provided that stringent quality assurance tests are in place and assays are standardised to criteria aligned to the international reference values and there are no conditions present that preclude its accurate 32 RCGP and NHS Diabetes. Coding, classification and diagnosis of diabetes. 2011 . http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20130402234253/http://gp.dh.gov.uk/2011/03/28/coding - classification -and-diagnosis -of-diabetes/ 33 WHO. Definition and diagnosis of DM and intermediate hyperglycaemia. 2006. www.who.int/diabetes/publications/Definition%20and%20diagnosis%20of%20diabetes_new.pdf 34 WHO. Use of HbA1c in the diagnosis of DM. Abbreviated repor t of a WHO consultation. 2011. www.who.int/diabetes/publications/report -hba1c_2011.pdf 42 measu rement. An HbA1c of 48 mmol/mol (6.5 per cent) is recommended as the cut - off point for diagnosing diabetes. A value less than 48 mmol/mol (6.5 per cent) does not exclude diabetes diagnosed using glucose tests. The WHO expert group concluded that there is c urrently insufficient evidence to make any formal recommendation on the interpretation of HbA1c levels below 48 mmol/mol (6.5 per cent). The use of HbA1c for diagnosing diabetes can avoid the problem of day -to-day variability of glucose values and importan tly it avoids the need for the patient to make preceding dietary preparations (such as fasting or consuming a glucose drink). The WHO also recommends that the diagnosis of diabetes in an asymptomatic patient is not made on the basis of a single abnormal pl asma glucose or HbA1c value. At least one additional HbA1c or plasma glucose test result with a value in the diabetic range is required, either fasting, from a random (casual) sample, or from an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). From April 2014 the Busin ess Rules include d a clinical code for \"diabetes in remission\". Successful management of diabetes with lifestyle, medication, pancreatic or islet cell transplant and/or bariatric surgery may result in glucose levels falling below those diagnostic of diabet es. However, these people may still experience the macrovascular and microvascular complications of diabetes and therefore need continued monitoring. Experts from the diabetes classification working group have endorsed the use of this code for people where treatment has normalised hyperglycaemia but still require continued monitoring. Practices may wish to review their patient records and re -code patients previously coded as \"diabetes resolved\" as \"diabetes in remission\" if they still require monitoring for the reasons outlined above. DM 017.2 Reporting and verification See indicator wording for requirement criteria. Verification - Commissioners may require randomly selecting a number of patient records of patients coded with the parent term 'diabetes melli tus' and requesting information about how long the specific diagnosis has been unknown. Commissioners may require contractors to demonstrate that they have processes in place to ensure that patient records are updated once a specific diagnosis has been made. Good practice is that this occurs within six to 12 months of the initial diagnosis. DM indicator 006 (NICE 2015 menu ID: NM95) The percentage of patients with diabetes, on the register, with a diagnosis of nephropathy (clinical proteinuria) or micro -albuminuria who are currently treated with an ACE -I (or ARBs) DM 006.1 Rationale NICE guidelines35,36 recommend the use of ACE-I (or ARBs) to slow the progression 35 NICE NG17. Type 1 diabetes in adults. 2015. https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng17 36 NICE NG28. Type 2 diabetes in adults: management. 2015. https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng28 43 of renal disease in patients with diabetes and trial evidence suggests that these are most effective when given in the maximum dose quoted in the BNF. Although trial evidence is based largely on ACE -I, it is believed that similar benefits occur from treatment with ARBs in patients who are intolerant of ACE -I. It is recommended that patients with a diagnosis of micro -albuminuria or proteinuria are commenced on an ACE -I or considered for treatment with ARBs. DM 006.2 Reporting and verification See indicator wording for requirement criteria. DM indicator 012 (NICE 2010 menu ID: NM13) The percen tage of patients with diabetes, on the register, with a record of foot examination and risk classification: 1) low risk (normal sensation, palpable pulses), 2) increased risk (neuropathy or absent pulses), 3) high risk (neuropathy or absent pulses plus def ormity or skin changes in previous ulcer) or 4) ulcerated foot within the preceding 12 months DM 012.1 Rationale Patients with diabetes are at high risk of foot complication s that could lead to ulcer, amputation or death . Evaluation and risk classification on an annual basis is important for the detection of feet at most risk. The NICE guideline on diabetic foot problems37 outlines foot risk classification . For the purposes of QOF the clinical codes for 'moderate risk' are used to record the concept of 'increased risk'. DM 012.2 Reporting and verification See indicator wording for requirement criteria. DM indicator 014 (NICE 2011 menu ID: NM27) The percentage of patients newly diagnosed with di abetes, on the register, in the preceding 1 April to 31 March who have a record of being referred to a structured education programme within 9 months after entry on to the diabetes register DM 014.1 Rationale Diabetes is a progressive long -term medical con dition that is predominantly managed by the person with the diabetes and/or their carer as part of their daily life. Accordingly, understanding of diabetes, informed choice of management options and the acquisition of relevant skills for successful self -management play an important role in achieving optimal outcomes. These needs are not always fulfilled by conventional clinical consultations. Structured educational (SE) programmes have been designed not only to improve people's knowledge and skills, but als o to help motivate and sustain people with both type 1 and type 2 diabetes in taking control of their condition and in delivering effective self -management. The indicator requires that SE is offered (preferably through a group education programme) to every person 37 NICE NG19 Diabetic foot problems : prevention and management (2015) http://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/NG19/ 44 with diabetes and/or their carer from the time of diagnosis, with annual reinforcement and review. An alternative education programme of equal standard may be offered to people unable or unwilling to participate in group education sessions. The NICE guideline for type 2 diabetes in adults38 considered SE models for diabetes to be both clinically and cost -effective. There are a number of SE programmes available for diabetes. Some programmes will be more suitable for type 1 diabetes and others for type 2 diabetes. The NICE quality standard for diabetes in adults39 is based on NICE guidelines . The NICE quality statement on SE states that 'People with diabetes and/or their carers receive a structured educational programme that fulfils the nationally agree d criteria from the time of diagnosis, with annual review and access to ongoing education'. The NICE quality standard states that a patient educational programme meets five key criteria laid down by the Department of Health and Social Care ( DHSC) and the Diabetes UK Patient Education Working Group: 1. Any programme should be evidence -based and suit the needs of the individual. The programme should have specific aims and learning objectives. It should support the learner plus his or her family and carers in de veloping attitudes, beliefs, knowledge and skills to self -manage diabetes. 2. The programme should have a structured curriculum that is theory -driven, evidence -based and resource -effective, has supporting materials and is written down. 3. The programme should be delivered by trained educators who have an understanding of educational theory appropriate to the age and needs of the learners and who are trained and competent to deliver the principles and content of the programme. 4. The programme should be quality as sured and be reviewed by trained, competent, independent assessors who measure it against criteria that ensure consistency. 5. The outcomes from the programme should be regularly audited. Some practices may be able to deliver SE programmes in -house. These programmes would need to meet the requirements outlined above. From February 2020 onwards, there is expected to be a phased roll -out of the Healthy Living in Diabetes Programme (HeLP). Referral to this programme will also meet the criteria for this indicator. This indicator suggests referral to a programme within nin e months of entry onto the diabetes register to be appropriate for people with type 1 or type 2 diabetes. A timeframe of nine months for this indicator has been set to take into account the differing expectations for referral into SE programmes from diagno sis for people with type 1 and type 2 diabetes.

Applying universal BP targets to all people with diabetes may inadvertently lead to the potential for undertreatment in those with less c omplex need and overtreatment in those with complex needs and co -morbidity41. This indicator focuses upon blood pressure management in people with diabetes without moderate or severe frailty and thus aims to reduce potential undertreatment and support bette r control of biomedical targets in people with the greatest capacity to benefit. Contractors should note that the BP target in this indicator is higher than that recommended for patients with Type 1 diabetes in NG17, where they should be aiming for 135/85 mmHg or 130/80mmHg if the person has albuminuria or two or more features of metabolic syndrome. The NICE guideline for type 2 diabetes42 recommends that people with type 2 diabetes should aim for a BP target of less than 140/80 mmHg unless they have kidney, eye or cerebrovascular damage in which case they should aim for less than 130/80 mmHg. 40 PHE. https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/annual -flu-programme 41 Kearney et al. undertreatment: time our thinking.

Rising levels of HbA1c increase the risk of mortality and developing macrovascular and microvascular complications. However, applying universal target levels regardless of comorbidities may inadvertently lea d to over -treatment, especially in older people with type 2 diabetes.43 This indicator allows for an individualised management approach that adjusts care according to an individual's frailty status. It aims to enable patients without moderate or severe frailty to benefit from tighter glycaemic control. Whilst the target in th is indicator is higher than those presented in NICE guidelines44, 45, this has been pragmatically selected as it represents the point at which people with type 2 diabetes should be considered for treatment intensification.

It aims to reduce complications and improve quality of life for people with moderate or severe frailty. NICE guidelines recommend that individualised HbA1c targets should be agreed with people with both type 1 and type 2 diabetes which consider factors such as their daily activities, aspirations, likelihood of complications, comorbidities and occupation. Individual targets, even for people with moderate or severe frailty , should be lower than the level specified in this indicator . The target in this indicator has been pragmatically selected as a level that HbA1c should not go beyond in order to avoid people becoming symptomatic of hyperglycaemia.

The NICE guideline for cardiovascular disease risk assessment and lipid modification46 recommends that people with type 1 diabetes are offered statin treatment for primary prevention when they are older than 40 years, or they have had diabetes for more than 10 years, or they have established nephropathy or other CVD risk factors. People with type 2 diabetes should be offered statin therapy if they have a 10% or greater 10 -year risk of developing CVD, estimated using the QRISK2 assessment tool. The NICE quality standard for cardiovascular risk assessment and lipid modificati on47 notes that people choosing statin therapy for primary prevention should be offered atorvastatin 20mg.

This indicator set is currently under review for 2020/21. The indicators and guidance will be updated once this review is complete to reflect the latest NICE guidance. AST indicator 001 The contractor establishes and maintains a register of patients with asthma, excluding patients with asthma who have been prescribed no asthma -related drugs in the preceding 12 months AST 001.1 Rationale Proactive structured review as opposed to opportunistic or unscheduled review is associated with reduced exacerbation rates and days lost from normal activity. The diagnosis of asthma is a clinical one; there is no confirmatory diagnostic blood test, radi ological investigation or histopathological investigation. In most patients, the 49 diagnosis can be corroborated by suggestive changes in lung function tests. One of the main difficulties in asthma is the variable and intermittent nature of asthma. Some of t he symptoms of asthma are shared with diseases of other systems. Features of an airway disorder in adults such as cough, wheeze and breathlessness should be corroborated where possible by measurement of airflow limitation and reversibility. Obstructive air ways disease produces a decrease in peak expiratory flow (PEF) and forced expiratory volume in one second ( FEV 1) but which persist after bronchodilators have been administered. One or both of these should be measured, but may be normal if the measurement i s made between episodes of bronchospasm. If repeatedly normal in the presence of symptoms, then a diagnosis of asthma is in doubt. A proportion of patients with COPD will also have asthma e.g. they have large reversibility - 400 mls or more on FEV 1 - but d o not return to over 80 per cent predicted and have a significant smoking history. These patients will be recorded on both the asthma and COPD registers. Children A definitive diagnosis of asthma can be difficult to obtain in young children. Asthma is to b e suspected in any child with wheezing, ideally heard by a health professional on auscultation and distinguished from upper airway noises. In school children, bronchodilator responsiveness, PEF variability or tests of bronchial hyperactivity may be used t o confirm the diagnosis, with the same reservations as above. Focus the initial assessment in children suspected of having asthma on the: presence of key features in the history and examination careful consideration of alternative diagnoses. Further inform ation SIGN guideline 153. SIGN and BTS. British guideline on the management of asthma. 2016. http://www.sign.ac.uk/assets/sign153.pdf It is well recognised that asthma is a variable condition and ma ny patients will have periods when they have minimal symptoms. It is inappropriate to attempt to monitor symptom -free patients on no therapy or very occasional therapy. This produces a significant challenge for the QOF. It is important that resources in primary care are targeted to patients with the greatest need - in this instance, patients who will benefit from asthma review rather than insistence that all patients with a diagnostic label of asthma are reviewed on a regular basis. It is for this reason that the asthma register is constructed annually by searching for patients with a history of asthma, excluding those who have had no prescription for asthma -related drugs in the preceding 12 months. This indicator has been constructed in this way as most c linical computer systems will be able to identify the defined patient list. 50 AST 001.2 Reporting and verification See indicator wording for requirement criteria. Part of the register criteria for asthma is based on appropriate prescribing of therapies. Fr om October 2014, the Business Rules were updated to exclude drug therapies licensed only for use in patients with a diagnosis of COPD as they are not licensed as a treatment for asthma. Patients with asthma whose sole asthma medication is one of the inha lers listed above then they will no longer appear on the QOF asthma register. Patients receiving additional, appropriate asthma treatment such as short -acting bronchodilators or steroid inhalers will remain on the register. Practices may wish to review the records of any patients affected by this change to revi ew their asthma treatment however, a change in prescribing should only be done where clinically appropriate. AST indicator 002 The percentage of patients aged 8 or over with asthma (diagnosed on or after 1 April 2006), on the register, with measures of var iability or reversibility recorded between 3 months before or any time after diagnosis AST 002.1 Rationale There is no single infallible test to confirm a diagnosis of asthma. On the basis of the clinical history and examination it will be possible to deci de if the probability of asthma is high, intermediate or low and the aim of investigations is to demonstrate objectively the presence of variability in order to support or reject the diagnosis. There are Read codes for 'suspected asthma' and 'suspected res piratory condition' which may be used whilst investigations are undertaken and the diagnosis confirmed. Further information about the diagnosis of asthma is provided in the BTS -SIGN asthma guideline49. It is crucial that diagnostic spirometry is performed t o published quality standards50. Further information - Association for respiratory technology and physiology. A guide to performing quality assured diagnostic spirometry. http://www.artp.org.uk/ Asthma history The di agnosis of asthma is suspected when a patient presents a history of variable wheeze, chest tightness, shortness of breath or cough, commonly triggered by viral infections and/or allergy and/or exercise. A personal or family history of atopy (including posi tive skin prick testing) increases the probability of asthma. 49 BTS/SIGN clinical guideline 153.

PCRJ. 2009 ; 18:130 -47. http://dx.doi.org/10.4104/pcrj.2009.00054 51 Practices may wish to confirm a diagnosis of asthma for those patients who were diagnosed with asthma in previous QOF years before they were eight years of age. Once the patient turns eight it i s acceptable to re -examine the diagnosis using tests of variability or reversibility. In those patients who are not receiving long -term anti - inflammatory therapy they should be treated as a new presenting case and the diagnosis re -evaluated. If asthma is p robable In symptomatic patients airway obstruction may be demonstrated by spirometry (FEV 1/FVC ratio <0.7) and (if available) nitric oxide can be used to measure airway inflammation. Variability of symptoms and/or lung function may be demonstrated in a rev ersibility test or may occur spontaneously over time in response to triggers or to treatment; demonstration of variability supports the diagnosis of asthma and may be conveniently achieved in primary care in a number of ways: Spirometry may be used to demo nstrate reversibility in symptomatic patients with demonstrated airflow obstruction. A bronchodilator reversibility test can be performed with inhaled or nebulised short acting beta agonist and if the obstruction reverses then asthma is confirmed. Signific ant reversibility is a change in FEV 1>12 per cent and 200 ml (the absolute change is scaled down according to predicted FEV 1 in children). Increases of >400 mls are strongly suggestive of asthma. Lower levels of bronchodilator reversibility may be demonstr ated in some patients with COPD51. Normal spirometry, however, does not exclude asthma; indeed the variable nature of asthma means that many of the milder patients seen in primary care will be asymptomatic at the time of the lung function test and will have completely normal lung function with no reversibility at the time of testing. Variability of PEF. This may be demonstrated by monitoring diurnal, or day to day variation (recorded twice a day for two weeks using the same peak flow meter) and/or demonstrat ing an increase after therapy (15 minutes after short - acting bronchodilator, after six weeks of inhaled steroids, or up to two weeks after oral steroid treatment) and/or after exposure to triggers (such as exercise, laughter, or allergens). Significant var iability is a change of 20 per cent and >60 l/min (the absolute change is scaled down in children to 20 per cent of predicted PEF). PEF are effort dependent and patients need to be taught the correct technique. Variability in objective measures of asthma symptom scores ( questions52, ACQ53, ACT questionnaire54, or GINA Control Tool55). Symptom scores may be particularly useful in patients unable to undertake accurate 51 NICE NG115 .

A trial of treatment, with repeated lung function measurements and/or symptoms scores over time will demonstrate objective improvement of symptoms and lung function in people with asthma, thereby confirming the diagnosis. In children it is particularly important to reduce and stop treatment to exclude spontaneous improvement56. If the probability of asthma is intermediate Spirometry is the key investigation for distinguishing obstructive and restrictive respiratory conditions and will determine subsequent investigations57. More specialist assessment may be required in those in whom the diagnosis is still unclear, which may include assessment of airway inflamma tion ( e.g. nitric oxide measurement), bronchial hyper -responsiveness testing and consideration of alternative diagnoses. It is recommended that children with combined food allergy and asthma and any patient with late onset asthma where there is a suspicion of an occupational cause are referred for specialist assessment. If another diagnosis is more likely If an alternative diagnosis is suspected, investigation and management are to follow guidelines for that condition. Co-morbidity: asthma and COPD A proportion of patients with asthma will have both asthma and COPD e.g. they have airway obstruction that does not reverse to normal but also have substantial reversibility58.

AST indicator 003 (NICE 2011 menu ID: NM23) The percentage of patients with asthma, on the register, who have had an asthma review in the preceding 12 months that includ es an assessment of asthma control using the 3 RCP questions AST 003.1 Rationale Structured care has been shown to produce benefits for patients with asthma. The reckoning of morbidity, PEF levels, inhaler technique and current treatment and the promotion of self -management skills are common themes of good structured care. 56 Brand P.

PCRJ 2008; 17:243 -245 57 BTS/SIGN clinical guideline http://www.sign.ac.uk/guidelines/fulltext/153/index.html 58 NICE NG115 . COPD http://guidance.nice.org.uk/NG115 . 53 The BTS/SIGN clinical guideline59 proposes a structured system for recording inhaler technique, morbidity, PEF levels, current treatment and asthma action plans. The guideline recommends t he use of standard questions for the monitoring of asthma. Proactive structured review, rather than opportunistic or unscheduled review, is associated with reduced exacerbation rate and fewer days lost from normal activity. QOF explicitly requires the foll owing RCP questions60 are used as an effective way of assessing symptoms: In the last month: have you had difficulty sleeping because of your asthma symptoms (including cough)? have you had your usual asthma symptoms during the day (cough, wheeze, chest tig htness or breathlessness)? has your asthma interfered with your usual activities (for example, housework, work/school, etc.)? The questions are to be asked at the same time and as part of the review. A response of ' no' to all questions is consistent with well-controlled asthma61. If the asthma appears to be uncontrolled, the following are to be managed appropriately before increasing asthma therapy: smoking behaviour (because smoking interferes with asthma control) poor inhaler technique inadequate adherenc e to regular preventative asthma therapy rhinitis. There is increasing evidence to support personalised asthma action plans in adults with persistent asthma. Contractors may wish to follow the advice of the BTS/SIGN guideline and offer a personalised asthm a action plan to patients. Peak flow is a valuable guide to the status of a patient's asthma, especially during exacerbations. However, it is much more useful if there is a record of their best peak flow (that is, peak flow when they are well). Many guidel ines for exacerbations are based on the ratio of current to best peak flows. For patients aged 19 or over no particular time limit is needed for measuring best peak flow. However in view of the reduction in peak flow with age, it is recommended that the me asurement be updated every few years. For patients aged 18 or under the peak flow will be changing; therefore it is recommended that the best peak flow be re -assessed annually. Inhaler technique is to be reviewed regularly. The BTS/SIGN clinical guideline emphasises the importance of assessing ability to use inhalers before prescribing and regularly reviewing technique, especially if control is inadequate. 59 BTS/SIGN clinical guideline 153.

The Business Rules require that co ntractors code the review and the responses to the three RCP questions separately and on the same day in order to meet the requirements of this indicator. AST indicator 004 The percentage of patients with asthma aged 14 or over and who have not attained the age of 20, on the register, in whom there is a record of smoking status in the preceding 12 months AST 004.1 Rationale Many young people start to smoke at an early age. It is therefore justifiable to ask about smoking on an annual basis in this age group . Studies of smoking related to asthma are surprisingly few in number. Starting smoking as a teenager increases the risk of persisting asthma. There are very few studies that have considered the question of whether smoking affects asthma severity. One cont rolled cohort study suggested that exposure to passive smoke at home delayed the recovery from an acute attack. There is also epidemiological evidence that smoking is associated with poor asthma control62. It is recommended that smoking cessation be encoura ged as it is good for general health and may decrease asthma severity63.

The most effective treatment is smoking cessation. Oxygen therapy has been shown to prolong life in the later stages of the disease and has also been shown to have a beneficial impact on exercise capacity and mental state. Some patients respond to inhaled steroids. Many patients respond symptomatically to inhaled beta -agonists and anti - cholinergics. Pulmonary rehabilitation has been shown to produce an improvement in quality of life. The majority of patients with COPD are managed by GPs and membe rs of the primary care team with onward referral to secondary care when required. This indicator set focuses on the diagnosis and management of patients with symptomatic COPD. 56 COPD indicator 001 The contractor establishes and maintains a register of pati ents with COPD COPD 001.1 Rationale A diagnosis of COPD is considered in any patient who has a history of exposure to risk factors for the disease (generally smoking) and symptoms of breathlessness, chronic persistent cough, sputum production , winter bronchitis or wheeze . The diagnosis is confirmed by post bronchodilator spirometry. See COPD002.1 Where patients have a long -standing diagnosis of COPD and the clinical picture is clear, it would not be essential to confirm the diagnosis by spirometry in order to enter the patient onto the register. However, where there is doubt about the diagnosis con tractors may wish to carry out post bronchodilator spirometry for confirmation. NICE guidance64 recommended a change to the diagnostic threshold for COPD in 2010 COPD 001.2 Reporting and verification See indicator wording for requirement criteria. Where patients have co -existing COPD and asthma they will be included on both disease registers. Approximately 15 per cent of patients with COPD will also have asthma. COPD indicator 002 (NICE 2015 menu ID: NM103) The percentage of patients with COPD (diagnosed on or after 1 April 2011) in whom the diagnosis has been confirmed by post bronchodilator spirometry between 3 months before and 12 months after entering on to the register COPD 002.1 Rationale A diagnosis of COPD relies on clinical judgement based on a co mbination of history, physical examination and confirmation of the presence of airflow obstruction using spirometry. NICE NG11565 provides the following definition of COPD: Airflow obstruction is defined as a reduced FEV 1/FVC ratio (where FEV 1 is forced exp ired volume in one second and FVC is forced vital capacity), such that FEV 1/FVC is < 0.7. If FEV 1 is greater than or equal to 80 per cent predicted normal a diagnosis of COPD would only be made in the presence of respiratory symptoms, for example breathles sness or cough. 64 NICE NG115. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in over 16s. 2018. https://www.nice.o rg.uk/guidance/ng115 65 NICE NG115. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in over 16s. 2018. https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng115 57 The NICE guideline recommends performing post bronchodilator spirometry to confirm a clinical diagnosis of COPD. Failure to use post bronchodilator readings has been shown to overestimate the prevalence of COPD by 25 per cent. Spirometry is to be performed after the administration of an adequate dose of an inhaled bronchodilator ( e.g. 400 mcg salbutamol). Prior to performing post bronchodilator spirometry, patients do not need to stop any therapy, such as long -acting bronchodilators or inhal ed steroids. The guideline on COPD recommends that all health professionals involved in the care of patients with COPD have access to spirometry and be competent in the interpretation of the results. The NICE quality standard for COPD in adults66, states that people aged over 35 years who present with a risk factor and one or more symptoms of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) have post - bronchodilator spirometry. It should be performed by a healthcare professional who has had appropriate training and who has up -to-date skills. COPD 002.2 Reporting and verification See indicator wording for requirement criteria. For measurement purposes, three months before diagnosis is defined as 93 days. COPD indicator 003 (NICE 2015 menu ID: NM104) The percentage of patients with COPD who have had a review, undertaken by a healthcare professional, including an assessment of breathlessness using the Medical Research Council dyspnoea scale in the preceding 12 months COPD 003.1 Rationale COPD is increasingl y recognised as a treatable disease with large improvements in symptoms, health status, exacerbation rates and even mortality if managed appropriately. Appropriate management is based on NICE NG115 and international GOLD guidelines in terms of both drug an d non -drug therapy. In making assessments of the patient's condition as part of an annual review and when considering management changes , it is essential that health care professionals are aware of: current lung function exacerbation history the degree of breathlessness (Medical Research Council [MRC ] dyspnoea scale). A tool such as the COPD Assessment Test (CAT) could be used to assess current health status. Additionally, there is evidence that inhaled therapies can improve the quality of lif e in some patients with COPD. However, there is evidence that patients require training in inhaler technique and that such training requires reinforcement. Where a patient is prescribed an inhaled therapy, their technique is to be assessed during any revie w. The MRC dyspnoea scale gives a measure of breathlessness and is recommended 66 NICE QS10.

COPD 008 .1 Rationale Pulmonary rehabilitation is a multidisciplinary programme of care which aims to reduce disability and improve quality of life in patients with a chronic respiratory impairment. It is individually tailored and designed to optimise each patient's physical and social performance and independence. The NICE guideline for COPD recommends that p ulmonary rehabilitation should be offered to all patients who consider themselves to be functionally disabled due to their COPD (usually MRC dyspnoea scale score of 3 ). Whilst most patients are likely to benefit, a rehabilitation programme is not suitable for patients who are unable to walk, have unstable angina or who have recently had a myocardial infarction. Medical management should be optimised before referral. 67 NICE NG115.

The percentage of patients diagnosed with dementia whose care plan has been reviewed in a face -to-face review in the preceding 12 months NICE 2015 menu ID: NM107 39 35-70% DEM - rationale for inclusion of indicator set Dementia is a syndrome characterised by an insidious but ultimately catastrophic progressive global deterioration in intellectual function and is a main cause of late -life disability. The prevalence of dementia increases with age and is estimated to be approximately seven per cent in those over 65 . Alzheimer's disease accounts for around 62 per cent of cases of dementia with vascular dementia accounting for around 17 per cent69,70. The annual incidence of dementia of the Alzheimers type rises to 34.3/100 person years at risk in the 90 year age group; the prevalence is higher in women than in men due to the longer lifespan of women. Other types of dementia such as Lewy Body dementia a nd fronto -temporal dementia are relatively rare but can be very distressing.

DEM 001.2 Reporting and verification See indicator wording for requirement criteria. DEM indicator 004 (NICE 2015 menu ID: NM107) The percentage of patients diagnosed with dementia whose care plan has been reviewed in a face -to-face review in the preceding 12 months DEM 004.1 Rationale Where a patient does not already have a care plan or an advanced care plan in place, it is expected that the pra ctice will develop a care plan. The face -to-face care plan or advanced care plan review focuses on support needs of the patient and their carer. Regular review can help ensure that any changes in need can be addressed. In particular the review should address the following key issues: an appropriate physical, mental health and social review for the patient, a record of the patients' wishes for the future, communication and co -ordination arrangements with secondary care (if applicable), identification of the patients' carer(s); and 1. obtain appropriate permissions to authorise the practice to speak directly to the nominated carer(s) and provide details of support services available to the patient and their family, if applica ble, the carer's needs for information commensurate with the stage of the illness and his or her and the patient's health and social care needs, 2. as appropriate , the carer should be included in the care plan or advanced care plan discussions, 3. if applicable, the impact of caring on the care -giver, 4. offer the carer a health check71 to address any physical and mental health impacts, including signposting to any other relevant services to support their health and wellbeing. The practice will agree with the patient and their carer, what is to be covered in the review and the duration of the consultation - where appropriate, extended consultations may take up to 30 minutes72. Ideally the first such appointment would be within six months of diagnosis. A series of well -designed cohort and case control studies have demonstrated that 71 Where the carer is registered at a different practice, the patients practice should inform the patient's carer that they can seek advice from their own practice. 72 The practice should agree with the patient the most suitable length of this for this appoin tment, this could be provided as two 15 minute appointments if this is more appropriate for the patient. 61 patients with Alzheimer -type dementia do not complain of common physical symptoms, but experience them to the same degree as the general population. Patient assessments theref ore include the assessment of any behavioural changes caused by: concurrent physical conditions ( e.g. joint pain or inter -current infections) new appearance of features intrinsic to the disorder ( e.g. wandering) and delusions or hallucinations due to the d ementia or as a result of caring behaviour ( e.g. being dressed by a carer). Depression could also be considered as it is more common in patients with dementia than those without73. Patients and carers are to be given relevant information about the diagnosis and sources of help and support (bearing in mind issues of confidentiality). Evidence suggests that healthcare professionals can improve satisfaction for carers by acknowledging and dealing with their distress and providing more information on dementia74. As the illness progresses, needs may change and the review may focus more on issues such as respite care. There is good evidence from well -designed cohort studies and case control studies of the benefit of healthcare professionals asking about the impact o f caring for a person with dementia and the effect this has on the caregiver. It is important to remember that male carers are less likely to complain spontaneously and that the impact of caring is dependent not on the severity of the cognitive impairment but on the presentation of the dementia, for example, on factors such as behaviour and affect. If the carer is not registered at the practice, but the GP is concerned about issues raised in the consultation, then with appropriate permissions they can conta ct the carer's own GP for further support and treatment. As the illness progresses and more agencies are involved, the review could additionally focus on assessing the communication between health and social care and non -statutory sectors as appropriate, t o ensure that potentially complex needs are addressed. Communication and referral issues highlighted in the review need to be followed up as part of the review process. Further information NICE NG97. Dementia: assessment.

Depression (DEP) Indicator Points Achievement thresholds Initial management DEP003.The percentage of patients aged 18 or over with a new diagnosis of depression in the preceding 1 April to 31 March, who have been reviewed not earlier than 10 days after and not later than 56 days after the date of diagnosis Based on NICE 2012 menu ID: NM50 10 45-80% DEP - rationale for inclusion of the indicator set Depression is common and disabling. In 2012, the estimated prevalence for a depressive episode among people aged 16 or over and under the age of 74 in England was 2. 5 per cent . If the broader and less specific category of 'mixed depression and anxiety' is included, these figures increase dramatical ly to 8.9 per cent75, 76. It contributes 12 per cent of the total burden of non -fatal global disease and by 2020, looks set to be second after CVD in terms of the world's disabling diseases77. Major depressive disorder is increasingly seen as chronic and rela psing, resulting in high levels of personal disability, lost quality of life for patients, their family and carers, multiple morbidity, suicide, higher levels of service use and many associated economic costs. In 2007 , the total cost of depression in Engla nd was reported to be \u00a37.5 billion of which health service costs comprised \u00a31.7 billion and lost earnings \u00a35.8 billion. When the cost of informal care, lower productivity and other public sector costs are included this figures is estimated 75 NICE CG90.

DEP indicator 003 (based on NICE 2012 menu ID: NM50) The percentage of patients aged 18 or over with a new diagnosis of depression in the preceding 1 April to 31 March, who have been reviewed not earlier than 10 days after and not later than 56 days after the date of diagnosis DEP 003.1 Rationale The NICE guideline on depression in adults states that patients with mild depression or sub -threshold symptoms be reviewed and re -assessed after initial presentation, normally within two weeks. CG90 recommends that patients with mild or moderate depression who start antidepressants are reviewed after one week if they are considered to present an increased risk of suicide or after two weeks if they are not considered at increased risk of sui cide. Patients are then re -assessed at regular intervals determined by their response to treatment and whether or not they are considered to be at an increased risk of suicide. This indicator promotes a single depression review between ten and 56 days inclusive after the date of diagnosis. For some patients this may not be their first review as they will have been reviewed initially within a week of the diagnosis. Unless a patient's symptoms have resolved, further reviews may be required. Only face -to-face or telephone contact with a clinician is acceptable to meet the requirements for this indicator. DEP 003.2 Reporting and verification See indicator wording for requirement criteria. Those patients whose on -going care is being provided by specialist menta l health services may have a personalised care adjustment applied . It is recommended that where the diagnosis is made by specialist mental health services and the patient has been discharged for follow -up by the primary care team, the contractor should fin d out the diagnosis date in order to record this and invite the patient for a review within the timeframe specified. Suspected depression seen in secondary care may not always be referred to specialist mental health services for further assessment and management. It may be in the form of a discharge letter from an acute medical or surgical ward, A&E or from an outpatient appointment. It may be reasonable in these circumstances for a contractor to contact the patient to ask them to attend for an assessment to assess if they have a clinical diagnosis of depression. The register for DEP003 for the purpose of calculating the APDF is defined as all patients aged 18 or over, diagnosed on or after 1 April 2006, who have an unresolved record of depression in their patient record. 78 DH.

This indicator set focuses on patients with serious mental illness. There are separate indicato r sets that focus on patients with depression and dementia. NICE CG17879 recommends primary care utilise registers to monitor the physical health of patients with psychosis or schizophrenia. NICE CG18580 recommends that patients with bipolar affective disor der have a physical health review, normally in primary care, performed at least annually, including the following health checks: weight or BMI, diet, nutritional status and level of physical activity 79 NICE CG178.

In addition to lifestyle factors, such as smoking, poor diet and lack of exercise, antipsychotic drugs vary in their l iability for metabolic side effects such as weight gain, lipid abnormalities and disturbance of glucose regulation. Specifically, they increase the risk of the metabolic syndrome, a recognised cluster of features (hypertension, central obesity, glucose int olerance or insulin resistance or dyslipidaemia) which is a predictor of type 2 diabetes and CHD81. MH indicator 001 The contractor establishes and maintains a register of patients with schizophrenia, bipolar affective disorder and other psychoses and other patients on lithium therapy MH 001.1 Rationale The register includes all patients with a diagnosis of schizophrenia, bipolar affective disorder and other psychoses and other patients on lithium therapy. Remission from serious mental illness Historically, patients have been added to the mental health disease register for schizophrenia, bipolar affective disorder and other psychoses, but over time it has become apparent that it would be appropriate to exclude some of them from the associated indicators becau se their illness is in remission. Making an accurate diagnosis of remission for a patient with a diagnosis of serious mental illness can be challenging and the evidence base to support when to use the 'remission code' is largely based on clinical judgement . A longitudinal international study of recovery from psychotic illnesses found that as many as 56 per cent of patients recovered from psychotic illnesses to some extent, although only 16 per cent recover if a more stringent concept of recovery82 is used. In the absence of strong evidence of what constitutes 'remission' from serious mental illness, it is advised that clinicians should only consider using the remission codes if the patient has been in remission for at least five years, that is where there 81 Mackin P, Bishop D, Watkinson H et al. Metabolic disease and cardiovascular risk in people treated with antipsychotics in the community . 2007. BJP 191: 23 -9. 82 Harrison G, Hopper K, Craig T, Laska E, Siegel C, Wanderling J et al. Recovery from psychotic illness: A 15 and 25 year international follow -up study . 2001. BJP, 178: 506 -517. 67 is: no record of antipsychotic medication, no mental health in -patient episodes; and no secondary or community care mental health follow -up for at least five years. Where a patient is recorded as being 'in remission' they remain on the register (in case their condition relapses at a later date) but they are excluded from the denominator for subsequent indicators. The accuracy of this diagnosis and the coding should be reviewed on an annual basis by a GP. If a patient who has been coded as 'in remission' experience s a relapse then this should be recorded as such in their patient record. In the event that a patient experiences a relapse and is coded as such, they will on ce again be included in all the associated indicators for schizophrenia, bipolar affective disorder and other psychoses. MH 001.2 Reporting and verification See indicator wording for requirement criteria. Verification - Commissioners may require randomly selecting a number of patient records in which a 'remission code' has been recorded and request evidence as to why it was appropriate for that patient to be considered 'in remission' and to confirm the ongoing accuracy of this coding . Contractors may be e xpected to demonstrate they have a protocol to guide their clinicians as to how this would work and who would be suitable to make the decision. It would not be appropriate for non -clinical members of the practice to make the decision as to when to enter th is code. MH indicator 002 (NICE 2015 menu ID: NM108) The percentage of patients with schizophrenia, bipolar affective disorder and other psychoses who have a comprehensive care plan documented in the records, in the preceding 12 months, agreed between ind ividuals, their family and/or carers as appropriate MH 002.1 Rationale This indicator reflects good professional practice and is supported by NICE CG17883. Patients on the mental health disease register should have a documented primary care consultation tha t acknowledges, especially in the event of a relapse, a plan for care. This consultation may include the views of their relative (s) or carer (s) where appropriate. Up to half of patients who have a serious mental illness are seen only in a primary care sett ing. For these patients, it is important that the primary care team takes responsibility for discussing and documenting a care plan in their primary care 83 NICE CG178 . Psychosis and schizophrenia in adults: prevention and management. 2014 . http://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/CG178 68 record. When constructing the primary care record, research supports the inclusion of the following in formation: patient's current health status and social care needs including how needs are to be met, by whom and the patient's expectations how socially supported the individual is: e.g. friendships/family contacts/voluntary sector organisation involvement. People with mental health problems have fewer social networks than average, with many of their contacts related to health services rather than sports, family, faith, employment, educat ion or arts and culture. One survey found that 40 per cent of people with ongoing mental health problems had no social contacts outside mental health services84 co-ordination arrangements with secondary care and/or mental health services and a summary of wh at services are actually being received occupational status - in England just over 30 per cent of people with mental health problems are currently in work, the lowest employment rate of any group of working aged people85. Studies show a clear interest in wo rk and employment activities among users of mental health services with up to 90 per cent wishing to go into or back to work86. 'Early warning signs ' from the patient's perspective that may indicate a possible relapse87. Many patients may already be aware o f their early warning signs (or relapse signature) but it is important for the primary care team to also be aware of noticeable changes in thoughts, perceptions, feelings and behaviours leading up to their most recent episode of illness as well as any even ts the patient thinks may have acted as triggers . the patient's preferred course of action (discussed when well) in the event of a clinical relapse, including who to contact and wishes around medication. If a patient is treated under the care programme app roach (CPA), then they have a documented care plan discussed with their community key worker available. This is acceptable for the purposes of QOF provided the practice has evidence of a review having taken place with the community key worker and the patie nt treated under the CPA. Where a patient has relapsed after being recorded as being in remission their care plan should be updated subsequent to the relapse. Care plans dated prior to the date of the relapse will not be acceptable for QOF purposes. MH 002.2 Reporting and verification See indicator wording for requirement criteria. 84 See Ford et al.

MH indicator 003 (NICE 2010 menu ID: NM17) The percentage of patients with schizophrenia, bipolar affective disorder and other psychoses who have a record of blood pressure in the preceding 12 months MH 003.1 Rationale Patients with schizophrenia have mortality between two and three times that of the general population and most of the excess deaths are from diseases that are the major causes of death in the general population. A prospective record linkage study of the mortality of a community cohort of 370 patients with schizophrenia found that the increased mortality risk is probably life -long and it suggested that cardiovascular mortality of schizophrenia has increased over the past 25 years relative to the general population88. The NICE guideline on bipolar disorder also states that the standardised mortality ratio for cardiovascular death may be twice that of the general population but appears to be reduced if patients adhere to long -term medication. Hypertension in people with schizophrenia is estimated at 19 per cent compared with 15 per cent in the general population89. A cross -sectional study of 4310 patients diagnosed with bipolar disorder in 2001 receiving care at veterans' administration facilities found a prevalence of hypertension of 35 per cent90. There is evidence to suggest that physical conditions such as cardiovascular disorders go unrecognised in psychiatric patients. A direct comparison of cardiovascular screening (blood pressure, lipid levels and smoking status) of patients with asthma, patients with schizophrenia and ot her attendees indicated that general practice were less likely to screen patients with schizophrenia for cardiovascular risk compared with the other two groups91. Recording (and treating) cardiovascular risk factors are therefore very important for patients with a serious mental illness. MH 003.2 Reporting and verification See indicator wording for requirement criteria. MH indicator 006 (NICE 2010 menu ID: NM16 ) The percentage of patients with schizophrenia, bipolar affective disorder and other psychoses who have a record of BMI in the preceding 12 months MH006.1 Rationale As noted above , people with serious mental illness are at increased risk of 88 Brown S, Kim M, Mitchell C et al. 25 year mortality of a community cohort with schizophrenia.

Obesit y is a key risk factor linked to this. when compared to the general population people with psychosis lead more sedentary lives, eat less fruit and vegetables, are more likely to be obese and to smoke. In addition to these lifestyle factors, antipsychotic d rugs vary in their liability for metabolic side effects such as weight gain, lipid abnormalities and disturbance of glucose regulation. Specifically, they increase the risk of metabolic syndrome, a recognised cluster of features (hypertension, central obes ity, glucose intolerance or insulin resistance and dyslipidaemia), which is a predictor of type 2 diabetes and coronary heart disease. About 40% of people with schizophrenia are obese and obesity is also common in people with bipolar disorders.

Cancer (CAN) Indicator Points Achievement thresholds Records CAN001. The contractor establishes and maintains a register of all cancer patients defined as a 'register of patients with a diagnosis of cancer excluding non -melanotic skin cancers diagnosed on or after 1 April 2003' 5 Ongoing management CAN003. The percentage of patients with cancer, diagnosed within the preceding 15 months, who have a patient review recorded as occurring within 6 months of the date of diagnosis Based on NICE 2012 menu ID: NM62 6 50-90% CAN - rationale for inclusion of indicator set It is recognised that the principal active management of cancers occurs in the secondary care setting. However, general practice often has a key role in the referral and subsequent support of these patients and in ensuring that care is appro priately co-ordinated. This indicator set is not evidence -based but does represent good professional practice. CAN indicator 001 The contractor establishes and maintains a register of all cancer patients defined as a 'register of patients with a diagnosis of cancer excluding non -melanotic skin cancers diagnosed on or after 1 April 2003' CAN 001.1 Rationale The register can be developed prospectively as the intention is to ensure appropriate 71 care and follow -up for patients with a diagnosis of cancer. For the purposes of the register all cancers are included except non -melanomatous skin lesions. CAN 001.2 Reporting and verification See indicator wording for requirement criteria. CAN indicator 003 (based on NICE 2012 menu ID: NM62) The percentage of patients with cancer, diagnosed within the preceding 15 months, who have a patient review recorded as occurring within 6 months of the date of diagnosis CAN 003.1 Rationale A GP will have an average of eight or nine new cancer diagnoses per year and will be looking after 20 to 30 patients with cancer. The increasing number of cancer survivors has led to an increase in the number of people requiring follow -up care, monitoring and management. Contractors are required to record that a patient review has occurred within six months of diagnosis to achieve this indicator. However, given the importance of primary care practitioners making early contact with patients who have been diagnosed with cancer, good practice would suggest that a review should occur between three to six months of diagnosis. Most practices will see patients with a new cancer diagnosis following assessment and management in a secondary or tertiary care setting. These patients quickly resume consultations in general practice at an increased rate to pre -diagnosis and treatment, therefore primary care has an important role in managing survivorship. This review represents an opportunity to address patients' needs fo r individual assessment, care planning and on -going support and information requirements. A cancer review in primary care includes: the patient's individual health and support needs, which will vary with, for example, the diagnosis, staging, age and pre -morbid health of the patient and their social support networks. In collaboration with the National Cancer Survivorship Initiative (NCSI), Macmillan primary care community has produced a template92 which recommends that this could cover a discussion of the diagnosis and recording of cancer therapy, an offer of relevant information, medication review, benefits counselling and recording of a carer's details the co -ordination of care between sectors. Further information on survivorship and the potential role for p rimary care can be found on the Macmillan website93. It is preferable that a review should be face -to-face in most cases. However, contacting a patient over the telephone will meet the requirements for this indicator. Where contact is made over the phone, an offer of a subsequent face -to-face review 92 For further information contact macdocs@macmillan.org.uk 93 Macmillan resources for GPs. www.macmillan.org.uk/gp 72 is advised. CAN 003.2 Reporting and verification See indicator wording for requirement criteria. For the purposes of this indicator, the six-month timeframe starts from the date of diagnosis irrespective of whe ther or not the diagnosis was made in primary care. For measurement purposes, six months is defined as 186 days. Verification - Commissioners may wish to review records where a review is claimed to confirm that the review has been completed within six mont hs of diagnosis. Chronic kidney disease (CKD) Indicator Points Achievement thresholds Records CKD005. The contractor establishes and maintains a register of patients aged 18 or over with CKD with classification of categories G3a to G5 (previously s tage 3 to 5 ) NICE 201 5 menu ID: NM 83 6 CKD - rationale for inclusion of indicator set The NICE guideline94 was published in July 2014 and revie wed the classification of CKD. NICE CG182 recommends classifying CKD using a combination of GFR and Albumin Creatinine Ratio (ACR) categories as G1 to G5, see description in table 1. In a cross -sectional point prevalence study95 of over 130,000 adults in England the age standardised prevalence of people with an estimated GFR <60 ml/min/1.73 m2 (CKD stages 3 -5) was 8.5 per cent. Those with CKD were more likely to have hypertension, diabetes and CVD compared to people with GFR>60 m l/min/1.73 m2, the prevalence of CKD rose with age and female gender. Limited data are available to provide an estimate of the overall population prevalence of CKD (diagnosed and undiagnosed). The available estimate suggests an overall prevalence of 13 per cent. Further information - NSF for Renal Services. 2005 . https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national -service -framework -kidney - disease This dis ease area applies to patients with category G3a, G3b, G4 and G5 CKD (eGFR<60 mL/min/1.73 m\u00b2 confirmed with at least two separate readings over a three month period). 94 NICE C G182. CKD in adults: assessment and management . 2014 . http://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/cg182 95 Stevens, P et al. C KD management in the UK : NEOERICA project results. Kidney International: 2007. 2 (1) 92 -99 73 Late presentation of patients with kidney failure increases morbidity, mortality and healt hcare associated with costs. The total cost of CKD in England in 2009/10 was estimated as being circa \u00a31.4 billion96. Early identification of CKD is therefore important to not only allow appropriate measures to be taken to slow or prevent the progression t o more serious CKD, but also to highlight and manage the key associated risks related to patient safety and avoidable harm. Table 1.

Estimating the financial cost of CKD to the NHS in England. Nephrology dialysis and transplantation. 2012. 27 (3) 73 -80. 74 CKD 005.1 Rationale CKD is common, frequently unrecognised and often exists with other conditions such as CVD and diabetes. A GFR less than 60 ml/min/1.73m2 is strongly associated with increa sed risk of adverse outcomes (acute kidney injury, end -stage kidney disease, all-cause mortality and cardiovascular mortality). Furthermore, a GFR less than 60 is also associated with increased frailty, impaired cognitive ability, increased risk of infecti on and an increase in prescribing errors . This indicator aims to establish a register of people with CKD categories G3a to G5 to enable appropriate advice, treatment and support to be provided for people with moderate to severe CKD and so help preserve kid ney function and reduce the risk of developing co -morbidity. Eating a meal containing protein can elevate creatinine, therefore it is recommended that patients do not eat meat in the 12 hours before their creatinine is measured and eGFR estimated. CKD 005. 2 Reporting and verification See indicator wording for requirement criteria. Epilepsy (EP) Indicator Points Achievement thresholds Records EP001. The contractor establishes and maintains a register of patients aged 18 or over receiving drug treatment for epilepsy. 1 EP - rationale for inclusion of indicator set Epilepsy is the most common serious neurological condition, affecting about five to ten per 1000 of the population at any one time. Few epilepsies are preventable, but appropriate clinical management can enable most patients with epilepsy to lead a full and productive life. For the purposes of the QOF, epilepsy is defined as 'recurrent unprovoked seizures'. EP indicator 001 The contractor establishes and maintains a register of patients aged 18 or over receiving drug treatment for epilepsy EP 001.1 Rationale The disease register includes patients aged 18 or over, as care for younger patients is generally undertaken outside of primary care. The phrase 'receiving treatment' has been included in order to exclude the large number of patients who may have had epilepsy in the past, may have not received treatment and been fit -free for many years. Some patients may still be coded as 'epilepsy' or 'history of epilepsy' and will be picked up on compute r searches. 75 Patients with a history of epilepsy who are not on drug therapy are excluded from the register. Drugs on repeat prescription will be picked up on a search. EP 001.2 Reporting and verification See indicator wording for requirement criteria. Verification - Commissioners may require a comparison of the expected prevalence with the reported prevalence recognising that reported prevalence will be reduced as the register is limited to those patients receiving drug treatment. Learning disabilities (LD ) Indicator Points Achievement thresholds Records LD00 4. The contractor establishes and maintains a register of patients with learning disabilities NICE 201 3 menu ID: NM73 4 LD - rationale for inclusion of indicator set People with learning disabilities are among the most vulnerable and socially excluded in our society. It is estimated that there are approximately 20/1,000 people with mild learning disabilities and 3 -4/1,000 with severe and profound learning disabilities in the UK. Over the p ast three decades, almost all the long -stay NHS beds for people with learning disabilities have closed and virtually all people with learning disabilities are now living in the community and depend on general practice for their primary care needs.

This is because without a complete register of people with learning disabilities, practices may not be aware of the reasonable adjustments tha t may be needed for a child or young person with learning disabilities and their family, and of the help and support that may be useful to them. Evidence suggests there are an increasing number of children with learning disabilities now surviving childhood , some of whom will have profound and multiple disabilities as they grow up97. It also suggests that health services are often unprepared for these children and young people and the complexity of their problems98. A full register of patients with learning disabilities will provide primary care practitioners with the first important building block in providing better quality and more appropriate services for this patient population. Learning disabilities are heterogeneous conditions, but are defined by three core criteria: lower intellectual ability (usually defined as an Intelligence Quotient [IQ] of less than 70) significant impairment of social or adaptive functioning; and onset in childhood. An IQ below 70 should not be used on its own to determine whether someone has a learning disability. The definition encompasses people with a broad range of disabilities. It includes adults with autism who also have learning disabilities, but not people wi th a higher level autistic spectrum disorder who may be of average or above average intelligence. The definition does not include all those people who have a \"learning difficulty\", eg specific difficulties with learning, such as dyslexia. Learning disabi lity is defined in Valuing People as the presence of: a significantly reduced ability to understand new or complex information, to learn new skills (impaired intelligence), with a reduced ability to cope independently (impaired social functioning) which st arted before adulthood (under the age of 18), with a lasting effect on development. For many people, there is little difficulty in reaching a decision whether they have a learning disability or not. However, in those individuals where there is some doubt about a diagnosis or the level of learning disability, referral to a multi -disciplinary specialist learning disability team (where available) may be necessary to assess the degree of disability and diagnose any underlying condition.

Contractors may wish to liaise with Social Services Departments, Community Learning Disability Teams and Primary Healthcare Facilitators where available to assist in the construction of a primary care database99. It is a statutory requirement under the Equality Act 2010 that public sector agencies make 'reasonable adjustments' to their practice that will make them as accessible and effective as they would be for people without disabilities. Reasonable adjustments include removing physical barriers to accessing health services, but importantly also include making whatever alterations are necessary to policies, procedures, staff t raining and service delivery to ensure that they work equally well for people with learning disabilities100.

Osteoporotic fragility fractures occur most commonly in the spine (vertebrae), hip (proximal femur) and wrist (distal radius). They also occur in the arm (humerus), pelvis, ribs and other bones. Fractures of the hands and feet (for example metacarpal and m etatarsal fractures) are not generally regarded as osteoporotic fragility fractures. Interventions for secondary prevention of fractures in patients who have had an osteoporotic fragility fracture includ e pharmacological intervention. OST indicator 004 (NICE 2011 menu ID: NM29) The contractor establishes and maintains a register of patients: Aged 50 or over and who have not attained the age of 75 with a record of a fragility fracture on or after 1 April 2012 and a diagnosis of osteoporosis confirmed on D XA scan; and Aged 75 or over with a record of a fragility fracture on or after 1 April 2014 and a diagnosis of osteoporosis OST 004.1 Rationale Fragility fractures are fractures that result from low -level trauma, which means mechanical forces that would n ot ordinarily cause fracture. The WHO has described this as a force equivalent to a fall from a standing height or less. Reduced bone density is a major risk factor for fragility fractures101, 102. Osteoporosis is a disease characterised by low bone mass and s tructural deterioration of bone tissue. The WHO defines osteoporosis as a bone mineral density of 2.5 or more standard deviations below that of a normal young adult (T - score of -2.5 or less) measured by a central dual -energy X -ray absorptiometry (DXA) scan . Bone mineral density is the major criterion used to diagnose and monitor osteoporosis. NICE guidance on osteoporosis fragility fractures recommends that a diagnosis of osteoporosis may be assumed in women aged 75 or over with a fragility fracture if the responsible clinician considers a DXA scan to be clinically inappropriate or unfeasible103. The SIGN guideline on the management of osteoporosis104 recommends that in frail elderly women (aged 80 or over) a DXA scan would be a 101 WHO.

Osteoporotic fragility fractures can cause substantial pain and severe disability, and are associated with decreased life expectancy. Osteoporotic fragility fractures occur most commonly in the spine (vertebrae), hip (proximal femur) and wrist (distal radius). They also occur in the arm (humerus), pelvis, ribs and other bones. Fractures of the hands and feet (for example, metacarpal and metatarsal fractures) are not generally regarded as osteoporotic fragility fractures. In women, the prevalence of osteoporosis increases markedly with age after menopause, from approximately two per cent at 50 years, rising to more than 25 per cent at 80 years. The NICE cost impact report for technology appraisal TA161 uses a prevalence of 11 per cent of post -menopausal women aged 50 or over with osteoporosis and a clinically apparent osteoporotic fragilit y fracture, rising to 19 per cent for ages 65 or over. There are an estimated 180,000 new fragility fractures in postmenopausal women in the UK each year; three quarters in women aged 65 or over. Postmenopausal women with an initial fracture are at substan tially greater risk of subsequent fractures. Half of patients with a hip fracture have previously had a fragility fracture of another bone. Hip fractures are associated with increased mortality; estimates of the relative mortality risk vary from two to gre ater than ten in the 12 months following hip fracture. However, it is unclear to what extend this can be attributed to fracture alone, as opposed to pre -existing co -morbidity. The SIGN guideline recommends that patients who have suffered one or more fragil ity fractures are priority targets for investigation and treatment of osteoporosis. This indicator promotes structured case finding for osteoporosis in patients who have had a fragility fracture. Its aim is to promote the secondary prevention of fragility fracture in patients with osteoporosis. OST 004.2 Reporting and verification The Business Rules for the two -part register will look for the following criteria: In patients aged 50 or over and who have not attained the age of 75: the earliest DXA scan with a positive result of osteoporosis the earliest diagnosis of osteoporosis a fragility fracture at any point on or after the implementation date (1 April 2012). In patients aged 75 or over: the earliest diagnosis of osteoporosis a fragility fracture at any point on or after the implementation date (1 April 2014). 80 Patients aged 50 or over and under the age of 75 in whom a diagnosis of osteoporosis has not been confirmed with DXA scanning will not be included in the register. For patients aged 75 or over the diagnosis of osteoporosis can be either confirmed with DXA scanning or clinically assumed (if DXA scan is considered to be clinically inappropriate or unfeasible). Patients with fragility fractures sustained in the last three months of the year will be excepted from this indicator. Although this indicator defines two separate registers, the disease register for calculating the APDF is defined as the sum of the number of patients on both registers. Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) Indicator Points Achievement thresholds Records RA001. The contractor establishes and maintains a register of patients aged 16 or over with rheumatoid arthritis NICE 2012 menu ID: NM55 1 Ongoing management RA002. The percentage of patients with rheumatoid arthritis, on the register, who have had a face -to-face review in the preceding 12 months NICE 2012 menu ID: NM58 5 40-90% RA - rationale for inclusion of indicator set Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic, disabling auto -immune disease characterised by inflammation in the peripheral joints, which causes swelling, stiffness, pain and progressive joint destruction. For a small proportion of people with RA, inflammatory disease outside the joints (i .e. eye and lung disease, vasculitis) can pose a significant problem. RA af fects around one per cent of the population; of these people, approximately 15 per cent have severe RA. Although the confirmation of diagnosis and initiation of treatment may take place in secondary care, primary care has an important role to play in the management of RA. This may include checking cardiovascular risk and blood pressure, checking the person's risk for osteoporosis and assessing for signs of low mood or depression. An annual face -to-face review in primary care is an opportunity to assess the effect of the disease upon the person's life, for example side effects to medication and whether they would benefit from any referrals to the MDT . RA indicator 001 (NICE 2012 menu ID: NM55) The contractor establishes and maintains a register of patients a ged 16 or over with rheumatoid arthritis 81 RA 001.1 Rationale The RA register includes patients aged 16 or over with established and recent -onset disease and in whom there is a definite diagnosis of RA, irrespective of evidence of positive serology and curre nt disease activity status. The register is restricted to patients aged 16 or over, to conform to international standards for differentiating RA from juvenile idiopathic arthritis. The register also includes patients with inactive RA. There are three potential groups of patients whose disease may be referred to as inactive: patients who are being treated and whose disease is in remission patients who are not receiving treatment for RA but have evidence of past disease, i .e. joint deformities. This type of RA is sometimes known as 'burnt out' RA. These patients are on the register as they remain at risk of the systemic effects of RA patients who are not receiving treatment for RA who have no evidence of past disease but there is doubt about their diagnosis. The contractor may wish to request (ESR) or plasma viscosity, C -reactive protein (CRP), rheumatoid factor and hand X -ray to determine the accuracy of the diagnosis. Inaccurate diagnoses can be removed from the patient's patient record which would also remo ve them from the register. Recognition of synovitis in primary care and prompt referral for specialist advice is key to the early identification and treatment of RA. Synovitis is inflammation of the membrane that lines the inside of synovial joints (most of the joints in the body). Symptoms of inflammation include pain, swelling, heat and loss of function of an affected joint. Identifying recent -onset RA can be challenging in primary care because of the variety of ways in which synovitis can present itsel f and the small number of patients who have RA compared with the number of patients with musculoskeletal symptoms. NICE guideline NG100105 recommends that patients with persistent synovitis are referred for specialist opinion. Urgent referral is needed when any of the following are present: the small joints of the hands or feet are affected more than one joint is affected there has been a delay of three months or longer between the onset of symptoms and seeking medical advice. Early identification of recent -onset RA is important because long -term outcomes are improved if disease modifying anti -rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) treatment is started within three months of the onset of symptoms.

Rheumatoid arthritis in adults: management. 2018 https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng100 82 Verification - Commissioners may wish to discuss with contractors the process they use to identify patients with RA, and the number of patients with inactive disease whose diagnoses have been reviewed and the outcomes of this review. RA indicator 0 02 (NICE 2012 menu ID: NM58) The percentage of patients with rheumatoid arthritis, on the register, who have had a face-to-face review in the preceding 12 months RA 002.1 Rationale RA is a chronic disease with a variable course over a long period of time. Therefore, there is a need for regular monitoring to determine disease status, assess severity, efficacy and toxicity of drug therapy and identify co -morbidities or complications. Patients with satisfactorily controlled established disease require review appointments for ongoing drug monitoring, additional visits for disease flares and rapid access to specialist care. RA and its treatment can also have a negative effect upon a patient's quality of life. It is recommended that contractors review the followin g aspects of care with a patient: disease activity and damage, which may include requesting C -reactive protein (CRP) or erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) or plasma viscosity test a discussion of DMARDS, if relevant the need for referral for surgery the effect the disease is having on their life, for example employment or education the need to organise appropriate cross -referral within the MDT . As a minimum, it is advised that this review covers disease activity and damage, the effect of the disease upon the patient's life and whether they would benefit from any referrals to the MDT RA 002.2 Reporting and verification See indicator wording for requirement criteria. Verification - Commissioners may wish to review patient records to ensure that all essential elements of the review have been performed. Palliative care (PC) Indicator Points Achievement thresholds Records PC001. The contractor establishes and maintains a register of all patients in need of palliative care/support irrespective of age 3 PC - rationale for inclusion of indicator set Palliative or end of life care is the active total care of patients with life -limiting disease and their families by a multi -professional team. The first National End of Life 83 Care (EoLC) Strategy106 was published in July 2008 followed by: the National Palliative and EoLC Partnership. Ambitions for palliative and EoLC: A national framework -content/uploads/2015/09/Ambitions you for EoLC: The Government response to the review of choice in EoLC. 201 6. https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/53 6326/choice -response.pdf Supporting patients to make person alised end of life care plans is a key commitment in the NHS Long Term Plan .107 There is also a commitment to improve access to palliative and end of life care for children. Timely identification of people in need of this support will be key to making these quality improvements. PC indicator 001 The contractor establishes and maintains a register of all patients in need of palliative care/support irrespective of age PC 001.1 Rationale About one per cent of the population in the UK die each year (over half a million), with an average of 20 deaths per GP per year. A quarter of all deaths are due to cancer, a third from organ failure, a third from frailty or dementia and only one twelfth of patients have a sudden death. It may therefore be possible to predict the majority of deaths; however, this is difficult and errors occur 30 per cent of the time. Two thirds of errors are based on over optimism and one third on pessimism. However, the co nsiderable benefits of identifying these patients include providing the best health and social care to both patients and families and avoiding crises, by prioritising them , anticipating need and enabling patients to be able to make informed decisions about the care and support they need . Identifying patients in need of palliative care, assessing their needs and preferences and proactively planning their care, are the key steps in the provision of high quality care at the end of life in general practice. Thi s indicator is focused on identifying the se patients - a critical first step in addressing the key elements of good medical practice identified by the General Medical Council .108 A patient is included on the register if any of the following apply: their dea th in the next 12 months can be reasonably predicted (rather than trying to predict, clinicians often find it easier to ask 'the 'surprise question' - 'Would I be surprised if this patient were still alive in 12 months?') they have advanced or irreversible disease and clinical indicators of 106 DH.

For these purposes, a patient is considered as terminally ill if they are suffering from a progressive disease and are not expected to live longer than six months). The register applies to all patients fulfilling the criteria regardless of age or diagnosis. The creation of a register will not in itself improve care but it enables the wider practice team to provide more appropriate and patient focussed care. PC 001.2 Reporting and verification See indicator wording for requirem ent criteria. In the rare case of a nil register at year end, if a contractor can demonstrate that it established and maintained a register in the financial year then they will be eligible for payment. 85 Section 4: Public health domain Cardiovascular disea se - primary prevention (CVD -PP) Indicator Points Achievement thresholds Initial diagnosis CVD -PP001. In those patients with a new diagnosis of hypertension aged 30 or over and who have not attained the age of 75, recorded between the preceding 1 April to 31 March (excluding those with pre -existing CHD, diabetes, stroke and/or TIA), who have a recorded CVD risk assessment score (using an assessment tool agreed with NHS CB) of 20% in the preceding 12 months: the percentage who are currently treated with statins 10 40-90% CVD -PP - rationale for inclusion of indicator set The latest Global Burden of Disease study shows that cardiovascular disease and specifically heart disease and stroke is one of the top five causes of early death in England109. Whilst there have been significant improvements in the last 40 years the rate of improvement has slowed. The NHS Long Term Plan (2019) identifies cardiovascular disease and its prevention as the single biggest area where the NHS can save lives over the n ext 10 years110. CVD -PP indicator 001 In those patients with a new diagnosis of hypertension aged 30 or over and who have not attained the age of 75, recorded between the preceding 1 April to 31 March (excluding those with pre -existing CHD, diabetes, strok e and/or TIA), who have a recorded CVD risk assessment score (using an assessment tool agreed with NHS England) of 20% in the preceding 12 months: the percentage who are currently treated with statins CVD -PP 001.1 Rationale The risk of c ardiovascular dis ease may be reduced through lifestyle changes, public health and NHS action on risk factors and the appropriate use of lipid modifying therapy. People with hypertension are at increased risk of cardiovascular disease and NICE Guidance CG127111 recommends that they are offered an assessment of risk using a validated assessment tool. 109 Steel et al. Changes in health in the countries of the U K and 150 English Local Authority areas 1990 -2016: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of disease Study 2016. The Lancet 2016. https://www.nice.org.uk/guidan ce/cg127 86 NICE CG181 recommends QRISK2112, 113 as the risk assessment tool of choice in patients aged between 25 -84 years. However, the Business rules for this indicator will also accept a risk assessment performed using the following additional tools: Framingham Joint British Society 2 (JBS2) QRISK QRISK3 . Clinical effectiveness of primary prevention As noted above , actions to reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease include lif estyle changes and, where appropriate, lipid modification therapy using statins. NICE CG181 recommends offering atorvastatin 20 mg for the primary prevention of CVD to patients who have a 10% or greater 10 -year risk of developing CVD however, the intervent ion threshold in this indicator has been pragmatically set at a 20% or greater 10-year risk. NICE CG181 also recommends that modifiable CVD risk factors such as smoking, diet and exercise should be optimised before statin therapy is offered for primary pre vention. NICE guidance recommends the decision whether to start statin therapy should be made after an informed discussion between the clinician and patient about the risks and benefits of statin treatment, considering additional factors such as potential benefits from lifestyle modifications, informed patient preference, comorbidities, polypharmacy, general frailty and life expectancy . A decision aid is available for patients: https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/cg181/resources/cg181 -lipid-modification -update - patient -decision -aid2 The following recommendations are m ade in relation to the communication of risk and treatment : Set aside adequate time during the consultation to provide information on risk assessment and to allow any questions to be answered. Documen t the discussion relating to the consultation on risk assessment and the patient's decision. Offer information about the person's absolute risk of CVD and about the absolute benefits and harms of an intervention over a 10 -year period. This information: 1. presents individualised risk and benefit scenarios 2. presents the absolute risk of events numerically 3. uses appropriate diagrams and text. Before starting statin treatment perform baseline blood tests and clinical assessment and treat comorbidities and secondary causes of dyslipidaemia. Include all of the following in the assessment: 112 QRISK2. https://qrisk.org/ 113 QRISK3 is under development and will supersede QRISK2. Once QRISK3 is available, it will be added to the Business Rules at the first opportunity. 87 smoking status alcohol consumption blood pressure BMI or other measures of obesity (NICE CG189114) total cholesterol, non -HDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol and triglycerides HbA1c renal function and eGFR transaminase level aminotransferase) thyroid stimulating hormone ( TSH). Where a patient decline s the offer of treatment, they should be advised that their CVD risk should be reconsidered in the future. The guideline also notes that CVD risk may be underestimated in people who are already taking anti -hypertensive or lipid modification therapy, or who have recently stopped smoking. The guideline also states that a target for total or low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol is not recommended for people who are treated with a statin for primary prevention of CVD. The guideline (CG181) states that total cholesterol, HDL and non-HDL cholesterol should be measured in people started on high intensity statin (both primary and secondary prevention, including atorvastatin 20mg for primary prevention) at 3 months of treatment and target is for >40% reduction in non -HDL cholesterol. An annu al non -fasting non-HDL measurement should be considered to inform an annual medication review. CVD -PP 001.2 Reporting and verification See indicator wording for requirement criteria. Patients with the following conditions are excluded from this indicator : CHD or angina stroke or TIA peripheral vascular disease familial hypercholesterolemia diabetes CKD with classification of categories G3a to G5. Verification - Commissioners may request that the contractor randomly selects a number of case records of pat ients recorded as having had a risk assessment, to confirm that the key risk factors have been addressed and that biochemical and other clinical data used to inform the risk assessment are up -to-date. Commissioners may also require contractors to demonstra te that age -appropriate risk assessment tools have been used. 114 NICE CG 189. Obesity prevention . 2014. https://www.nice.org.uk/g uidance/cg189 88 Blood pressure (BP) Indicator Points Achievement thresholds BP002. The percentage of patients aged 45 or over who have a record of blood pressure in the preceding 5 years. NICE 2012 menu ID: NM61 15 50-90% BP indicator 002 (NICE 2012 menu ID: NM61) The percentage of patients aged 45 or over who have a record of blood pressure in the preceding 5 years BP 002.1 Rationale Detecting elevated blood pressure and, where indicated, treating it, is known to be an effective health intervention. Raised blood pressure is common if it is measured on a single occasion but with repeated measurement blood pressure tends to drop. Guideline recommendations for the diagnosis and treatment of hypertension115 are to be followed by practitioners when deciding on whether to treat raised blood pressure. The age limit of aged 45 or over, has been chosen as the vast majority of patients develop hypertension after this age, this is also in line with the NHS Health Che cks Scheme. It is also to align the indicator more closely with the vascular checks programme and the cost -effectiveness modelling undertaken to support that programme. The age range 45 or over, coupled with a five-year reference period, is designed to ens ure that a blood pressure measurement takes place by the time someone reaches the age of 45. It is anticipated that contractors will opportunistically check blood pressures in all adult patients. BP 002.2 Reporting and verification See indicator wording f or requirement criteria. Generally , personalised care adjustment criteria (see Section 6) do not apply to this indicator. However, practices are able to remove patients from th e denominator where the patient declines to accept offered care. Obesity (OB) Indicator Points Achievement thresholds Records OB002. The contractor establishes and maintains a register of patients aged 18 years or over with a BMI 30 in the preceding 12 months 8 115 NICE CG 127. Hypertension in adults: diagnosis and management. 2016 . http://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/cg127 89 OB - rationale for inclusion of indicator set The Global Burden of Disease study identifies obesity as one of the top five risk factors contributing to premature death in England along with smoking, poor diet, high blood pressure and drug and alcohol use116. Nearly two -thirds of adults in England are overweight or obese, some of the worst figures in Europe117. As noted in the NHS Long Term Plan obesity is linked with type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, increased rates of respiratory, musculoskeletal and liver disease and certain types of cancer. The NHS Long Term Plan commits to a targeted offer of support and access to weight management services in primary care for people with a diagnosis of hypertension or type 2 diabetes with a BMI >30, amongst other actions to reduce obesity. Further informatio n NICE has produced multiple guidelines on clinical and public health approaches to tacking obesity, they can be accessed via the NICE Obesity Pathway https://pathways.nice.org.uk/pathways/obes ity OB indicator 002 The contractor establishes and maintains a register of patients aged 18 years or over with a BMI 30 in the preceding 12 months OB 002.1 Rationale The register includes all patients whose BMI has been recorded by the practice as part of routine care. It is expected that this data will inform public health planning and support onward referral to weight management services . NICE guideline CG189118 recommends using BMI as a practical estimate of adiposity in adults. Identifying people wit h a BMI 25 includes a preventative aspect of care in managing obesity and supports interventions for people at risk of obesity ie those who are overweight but not yet obese.

About 6.1 million people in England smoke119 and an estimated quarter of women in the UK smoke during pregnancy120, Smoking is linked to a wide range of disease and conditions including cancers, respiratory disease, cardiovascular disease, stomach and duodenal ulcers, erectile dysfunction and infertil ity, osteoporosis, cataracts, age related macular degeneration and periodontitis121. Smoking during pregnancy can cause serious pregnancy related health problems, these include: complications during labour and an increased risk of miscarriage, premature birt h, still birth, low birth -weight and sudden unexpected death in infancy122. Smoking during pregnancy also increases the risk of infant mortality by 119 ONS. Adult smoking habits in the UK: 2017.

The aim of this domain is to increase the proportion of successful smoking quit attempts by providing the best available support and treatment. There is good evidence to suggest that offering support and treatment is sufficient to motivate some smokers to attempt to stop who would not have done so with brief advice to quit alone. For ex ample, a Cochrane review that included 132 trials of nicotine replacement therapy (NRT), with over 40,000 people in the main analysis, found evidence that all forms of NRT made it more likely that a person's attempt to quit smoking would succeed. The chanc es of stopping smoking were increased by 50 to 70 per cent124. NHS Stop Smoking Services, combine psychological support and medication. 'An offer of support and treatment' means offering a referral or self -referral to a local NHS Stop Smoking Service advise r (who might be a member of the practice team) plus pharmacotherapy. Where such support is not acceptable to the patient, an alternative form of brief support, such as follow -up appointments with a GP or practice nurse trained in smoking cessation, may be offered. The NICE guidance on smoking cessation125 states that healthcare professionals who advise on, or prescribe, NRT, varenicline or bupropion: offer NRT, varenicline or bupropion, as appropriate, to patients who are planning to stop smoking offer behavi oural support including referral to the local Stop Smoking Service, to help patients in their attempt to quit when deciding which therapies to use and in which order, discuss the options with the client and take into account: 1. whether a first offer of refer ral to the local Stop Smoking Service has been made 2. contra -indications and the potential for adverse effects 3. the client's personal preferences 4. the availability of appropriate counselling or support 5. their previous experience of smoking cessation aids. The guidance also states that managers and providers of local Stop Smoking Services: offer behavioural counselling, group therapy, pharmacotherapy, or a combination of treatments that have been proven to be effective ensure clients receive behavioural support from a person who has had training and supervision that complies with the 'Standard for training in smoking cessation treatments'126 or its updates provide tailored advice, counselling and support, particularly to clients from minority ethnic and disadvanta ged groups 123 DH.

NICE guidance also states that stop smoking advisers and other healthcare practitioners who advise on, supply, or prescribe, pharmacotherapies should encourage people who a re already using an unlicensed nicotine -containing product (such as unlicensed electronic cigarettes) to switch to a licensed product127. Due to the potential for ex -smokers to resume smoking within three years of cessation, it is good clinical practice to a sk patients with a history of smoking their current smoking status and offer treatment and advice where necessary. It is also good practice to ask and record the smoking status of newly registered patients and to offer support and treatment where necessar y.

SMOK 002.2 Reporting and verification See indicator wording for requirement criteria. The contractor should report smoking status using the following guidance: Smokers For patients who smoke, smoking status should be recorded in the pre ceding 12 months. Non-smokers It is recognised that life -long non -smokers are very unlikely to start smoking and repeatedly asking smoking status can be unnecessary. Smoking status for this group of patients should be recorded in the preceding 12 months fo r until the end of the financial year in which the patient reaches the age of 25. Once a patient is over the age of 25 years (e .g. in the financial year in which they reach the age of 26 or in any year following that financial year) to be classified as a 127 NICE public health guidance 48. Smoking : acute, maternity and mental health services . 2013. http://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/PH48 93 non-smoker they should be recorded as: never smoked which is both after their 25th birthday and after the earliest diagnosis date for the disease which led to the patient's inclusion on the SMOK002 register (e .g. one of the conditions listed on the SMOK002 register). Ex-smokers Ex-smokers can be recorded as such in the preceding 12 months for SMOK002. Practices may choose to record ex -smoking status on an annual basis for three consecutive financial years and aft er that smoking status need only be recorded if there is a change. This is to recognise that once a patient has been an ex -smoker for more than three years they are unlikely to restart. For the purposes of QOF users of electronic cigarettes who have never smoked or given up smoking should be classified as non -smokers or ex -smokers respectively. The disease register for the purpose of calculating APDF for SMOK002 and SMOK005 is defined as the sum of the number of patients on the disease registers for each of the conditions listed in the indicator wording. Patients with one or more co-morbidities e .g. diabetes and CHD are only counted once. SMOK indicator 004 (based on NICE 2011 menu ID: NM40) The percentage of patients aged 15 or over who are recorded as cur rent smokers who have a record of an offer of support and treatment within the preceding 24 months SMOK 004.1 Rationale See rationale above.

This indicator relates to patients who are on the disease registers for CHD, PAD, stroke or TIA, hypertension, diabetes, COPD, CKD, asthma and mental health who are recorded as current smokers. SMOK 005.2 Reporting and verification See indicator wording for requirement criteria. 94 The disease register for the purpose of calculating APDF for SMOK002 and SMOK005 is defined as the sum of the number of patients on the disease registers for each of the conditions listed in the indicator wording.

Specific requirements apply to these indicators in relation to the Personalised Care Adjustment. These are detailed in Section 6. CS00 5.2 and CS006.2 Reporting and verification See indicator wording for requirement criteria. Commissioners may require that the con tractor can provide a computer print -out 95 showing the number of eligible women on the contractor list, the number with a personalised care adjustment and the number who have had a cervical screening test performed at the appropriate time interval. Women nee d to be sent a minimum of three invitations before the personalised care adjustment of not responding to invitations for care can be applied as described in Section 6 of this guidance . As of 2019, there will be a discrete SNOMED code to record that women h ave not responded to three invitations for cervical screening. 96 Section 5: Quality improvement domain Prescribing safety Indicator Points Achievement thresholds QI001. The contractor can demonstrate continuous quality improvement activity focused upon prescribing safety as specified in the QOF guidance . 27 NA QI002. The contractor has participated in network activity to regularly share and discuss learning from quality improvement activity as specified in the QOF guidance . This would usually include participating in a minimum of two p eer review meetings . 10 NA End of life care Indicator Points Achievement thresholds QI003: The contractor can demonstrate continuous quality improvement activity focused on end of life care as specified in the QOF guidance 27 NA QI004: The contractor has participated in network activity to regularly share and discuss learning from quality improvement activity as specified in the QOF guidance . This would usually include participating in a minimum of two network peer review meetings. 10 NA Rationale for inclusion of a QI domain This is a new domain which seeks to fulfil the recommendation in the Report of the Review of QOF128 to introduce a quality improvement domain. The aim of this domain is to provide support for contractors and their staff to recognise areas of care which require improvement, and take steps to address this through the development and implementation of a quality improvement plan and sharing of learning across their network. Being skilled in quality improvement has been recognised as a key role for healthcare professionals in the Shared View of Quality129. NHS England and GPC England have worked with the Royal College of General Practitioners, NICE and the Health Foundation to develop the topic specific guidance included here. This guidance sets specific objectives for each topic which contractors are expected t o work towards and provides advice on potential quality improvement 128 actions. Within the parameters set out in this guidance, contractors are encouraged to understand where they have the potential to make quality improvements and then to design and implemen t bespoke quality improvement plans, including improvement targets to address these. There are no deadlines given for the completion of the diagnostic activities, the subsequent plan or the network meetings. However, contractors are advised that they are e xpected to be working on these improvement activities throughout the QOF year. The two topic areas identified for 2019/20 are prescribing safety and end of life care. These topics will change on an annual basis. Through practice engagement with these and future modules we expect to see measurable improvement in the quality of care and patient experience at a national level against the areas of focus described in the individual modules. The focus of the indicators and associated points is on contractor eng agement and participation in the quality improvement activity both in the practice and through sharing of learning across their network. This is to recognise that not all quality improvement activity will be successful in terms of its immediate impact upon patient care. If a contractor does not achieve the targets which they have set themselves this would not in itself be a reason to withhold QOF points and associated payments, unless they have also failed to participate in the activities described in the g uidance. All the supporting information and resources referred to in this guidance will be made available on NHS England's website by end of March 2019. Further information as to how to undertake quality improvement activities is available from a number of sources including: NHS England Sustainable Improvement Team130 - this is a national resource to support quality improvement activity in primary care and includes training, practical advice and support from quality improvement specialists.

The contractor can demonstrate continuous quality improvement activity focused upon prescribing safety as specified in the QOF guidance. 27 NA QI002. The contractor has participated in network activity to regularly share and discuss learning from quality improvement activity as specified in the QOF guidance. This would usually include participating in a minim um of two peer review meetings. 10 NA Rationale Medicines prevent, treat or manage many illnesses or conditions and are the most common intervention in healthcare ( NICE, 2015 ). The number of prescribed medicines supplied in primary care in England has been increasing year on year. The Health Survey for England 2016 (NHS Digital, 2017 ) reported that 1,104 million prescription items were dispensed in 2016, an increase of 1.9% (20.5 million additional items) on the number dispensed in 2015. The average number of prescription items per head of the population in 2016 was 20.0, compared with 19.8 items in the previous year. As primary care staff will be aware, the number of people with multiple conditions is increasing; 25% of all people in England live with 2+ conditions and 8% live with 4+ cond itions ( Health Foundation, 2018 ). Over a 2 -year period, people with 4+ conditions visited their GP almost 25 times for face to face consultations and were prescribed over 20 different medications. In May 2012, the GMC published its report Investigating the prevalence and causes of prescribing errors in general practice which found that 1 in 20 prescriptions contained an error in terms of medication or monitoring. Most were graded as mild or moderate severity but 1 in 550 was a severe error. Many such errors relate not just to a prescriber's clinical knowledge but also to communication between primary and secondary care, communi cation with patients and carers, and safety monitoring systems in practices. Through these QOF indicators practices are being encouraged to help meet the WHO challenge to reduce medication -related harm by 50% by December 2022 (Medication Without Harm , Third Global Patient Safety Challenge, WHO, 2017) and recently announced five-year action plan to reduce antimicrobial resistance (Tackling antimicrobial resistance 2019 -2024, HM Government 2019). Overview of the QI module The overarching aim of these QI indicators is to lead to improvements in the 99 following aspects of prescribing safety: Reduce the rate of potentially hazardous prescribing, with a focus upon the safer use of non -steroidal anti -inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in patients at significant risk of complications such as gastro -intestinal bleeding. Better monitoring of potentially toxic medications and the creation of safe systems to support drug monitoring through a focus upon lithium prescribing (or another agreed medication if no patients on the registered list are currently being prescribed lithium). Better engagement of patients with their medication through a focus upon valproate and pregnancy prevention. Improve collaboration between practices, networks and community pharmacists to share learn ing and improve systems to reduce harm and improve safety. Practices will need to: i. Evaluate the current quality of their prescribing safety and identify areas for improvement - this would usually include a baseline assessment of current prescribing (QI001) ii. Identify quality improvement activities and set improvement goals to improve performance in the three identified areas - see below (QI001) iii. Implement the improvement plan (QI001) iv. Participate in a minimum of 2 network peer review meetings (QI002) v. Complete t he QI monitoring template in relation to this module (QI001 + QI002) The following section includes further detail on the types of things practices could do to deliver this module. These are suggestions only and the decision about what to include in the QI plan and which QI methodologies to use should be made by practices and shared with their peers through the network meetings. Detailed contractor guidance 1. Identifying areas for improvement All practices should undertake an audit of the current quality of their prescribing in relation to the following measures: Patients at significant risk of gastrointestinal adverse effects who have been prescribed a nonselective nonsteroidal anti -inflammatory drug (NSAID) without co-prescription of a proton -pump inhibitor (PPI) in the preceding 6 months. Patients receiving lithium and being monitored in primary care who have not had a recorded check of their lithium concentrations, estimated glomerular filtration rate, urea and electrolytes, serum calcium and thyroid funct ion in the previous 6 months. Girls and women of childbearing potential currently being prescribed valproate have had an annual specialist medication review and are taking this in compliance with the pregnancy prevention programme as documented by a specia list in the annual risk acknowledgement form. This standard applies equally 100 to unlicensed use for pain, migraine and other conditions. Where practices do not have any patients being prescribed lithium they may select an alternative medication to focus on based on their prescribing data and professional judgement. It is recommended that the medication chosen reflects similar issues to lithium prescribing e.g. a requirement for systematic toxicity monitoring. Suggested alternatives include the appropriate mo nitoring of amiodarone, phenobarbital or methotrexate. As this is a quality improvement exercise, this should not lead to the removal of locally agreed shared care protocols, including any associated funding to deliver the activity. Any a lternative to lithium should be agreed between the contractor and the commissioner. Even if a practice does not have any girls of any age or women of childbearing potential who are currently prescribed valproate, they should ensure their practice has a robust system in place to identify and refer for annual specialist review any new at -risk patients being prescribed valproate and should ensure continuous measurement of this measure. The inclusion of valproate prescribing and monitoring seeks to further promote health care professional awareness of the appropriate monitoring actions whilst awaiting the report of the Independent Medicines and Medical Devices Safety Review, chaired by Baroness Cumberlege. These medications have been selected as they are linked to signifi cant potential harm if prescribed and managed inappropriately. At a national level, progress against these measures will be monitored and used to inform any evaluation of this QI module. Practices may also find it useful to undertake a reflective group meeting and complete a SWOT (strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, threats) analysis. Guidance as to how to do this can be found in the RCGP guide How to get started in Box 1. How to do a prescribing audit A prescribing audit is considered to have five steps: 1. Choose a relevant topic (such as NSAID prescribing) 2. Derive some standards from good quality guidelines (e .g. NICE) 3. Measure your prescribing practice (through searches in the clinical system) and compare how you do against you r chosen standards 4. Plan any actions needed to make improvements or sustain good practice and implement them, setting clear goals to achieve 5. Repeat the measurement of your prescribing practice against the standards to assess the impact of the changes you ha ve made. Continue repeated cycles of these steps as you judge necessary. An audit function is available on all GP software systems to identify and recall all women and girls being prescribed valproate who may be of child bearing potential. Contractors shou ld use this tool in preference to developing their own bespoke searches. 101 QI136 . Understanding and sharing individual learning experiences and promoting reflective practice as individuals and in groups helps in the creation of a culture of learning and continuous improvement an d the ultimate success of any quality improvement activity. 2. Identifying quality improvement activities and setting improvement goals Following the initial baseline assessment, practices should develop a quality improvement plan which describes the actions they are going to take to address the prescribing safety improvements they are going to make. Evidence based improvement quality activities include: Audit of current prescribing against validated measures Review of patients identified as potentially at ri sk through the audit Review of practice systems to address organisational factors which contribute to medication related harm Ongoing measurement to demonstrate the impact of any changes137 138 Objectives to support these plans should be SMART (Specific, Meas urable, Achievable, Relevant and Time -bound). See Box 2 for examples. Practices should set their own targets for improvement based upon their baseline audit results. These should be challenging but realistic and recognise that it may be easier to make larg er improvements when starting from a modest baseline. These should be validated by network peers as part of the initial network review meeting. Factors to consider when setting these targets include: The severity level of identified clinical risk to patien ts The urgency of the timescale to review patients and reduce the risk The availability and training of appropriate practice staff to review patients Quality improvement activities can involve the whole practice team and specialist advice as necessary. In relation to prescribing safety, practices are encouraged to work with clinical and community pharmacists to consider potential improvements and how these may be realised. There are many aspects of prescribing safety which would be suitable for quality improvement work, but practices should as a minimum address the aspects listed above. A number of external resources are available to support practices with improving prescribing safety such as the RCGP Patient Safety toolkit . In addition, the Academic Health Sciences Network (AHSNs) are implementing the PINCER intervention between now and 2020. Practices are encouraged to eng age with their AHSN to access this support. al.

N Eng J Med 2016;374:1053 -1064. https://doi.org/10.1056/NEJMsa1508955 102 Box 2: Examples of SMART objectives Objective 1: Baseline practice prescribing analysis identifies patients on regular NSAID prescriptions with a recorded contraindication. SMART outcome: Repeat analysis after 3 months (and repeated at 3monthly interval thereafter) shows NO PATIENTS with a recorded contraindication have been prescribed NSAIDS. Objective 2: Baseline practice prescribing analysis shows only 5% of patients obtaining a regular (repeat) NSAID have had a clinical safety risk assessment clearly documented within the last 12months. SMART outcome: Increase from 5% to X% over the next 6 months (practice to decide) and X -Y% over the 6 -12 months (practice to decide) of people prescribed NSAIDs regular ly have a documented clinical safety risk assessment (as part of their medication review) as per NICE advice within the preceding 12months. Objective 3: Baseline practice prescribing analysis shows 50% of patients prescribed lithium for more than one year and suitable (as per NICE guidance) for 6 monthly checks had had a recorded serum lithium level checked within the last 6 months. SMART outcome: At a repeat analysis 6 months after the baseline analysis there is an increase from 50% to X% (practice to deci de) of patients prescribed lithium for greater than a year who are suitable for 6 monthly checks who have a recorded serum lithium level within the last 6 months. Objective 4 Baseline practice prescribing analysis shows no girls or women of childbearing po tential are currently prescribed valproate without a highly effective pregnancy prevention plan in place as per MHRA guidelines. However no practice system is in place to routinely identify new potential at risk patients. SMART outcome: Within one month th e practice can demonstrate an appropriate repeated monthly search of the clinical system to identify all girls or women of childbearing potential who have been recommended to start valproate medication have had a clinical review to ensure compliance with t he pregnancy prevention programme as recommended by the MHRA. 103 Guidance on specific elements of the quality improvement activity NSAID prescribing NICE Clinical Knowledge Summary (CKS) on NSAID prescribing (revised August 2018) provides advice on this topic including how to reduce harm from gastrointestinal side effects such as ulcer, perforation, obstruction or bleeding. Nonsteroidal anti -inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) must not be prescribed to people with: active gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding, or active GI ulcer history of GI bleeding related to previous NSAID therapy, or history of GI perforation related to previous NSAID therapy history of recurrent GI haemorrhage (two or more distinct episodes), or history of recurrent GI ulceration (two or more distinct episodes). The CKS advice also sets out how to assess risk of harm from NSAIDS in patients and then what appropriate prescribing decisions to take. This advice can be used as evidence -based standards against which to assess a practice's current prescribing. Example s of the audit standards which practices could adopt are: No patients with a current clinical contraindication are currently being prescribed an NSAID medication. 100% of patients with an NSAID medication on regularly receiving a repeat prescription have h ad a documented clinical safety risk review in the last 12 months. 100% of patients identified as high risk and requiring ongoing treatment have been prescribed a selective NSAID. 100% of patients identified as moderate risk and requiring ongoing treatmen t have been prescribed an appropriate NSAID with proton pump inhibitor unless contraindicated. Practices should then demonstrate the action they have taken to reduce risk to these patients, and the system or process they will continue to use to maintain s afe NSAID prescribing. Monitoring or potentially toxic medications - Lithium NICE guidance Bipolar disorder: assessment and management , NICE (2014) clearly sets out the requirements for monitoring li thium once a patient has been returned from secondary to primary care. Analysis of the practice's prescribing data and searches within the practice's electronic clinical system will be able to identify individual patients prescribed lithium who are not bei ng managed in line with NICE guidance. Practices are encouraged to review their process for following up a person who has not responded to invitations for monitoring or fails to order or collect prescriptions to ensure concordance with treatment plans and avoid clinical deterioration and crisis. Practices can use the QI approach to ensure their processes for lithium monitoring are robust and comply with NICE guidance and take action to identify and reduce any risks to individual patients. 104 Valproate and preg nancy prevention programme - MRHA alert April 2018, updated October 2018 (see also Drug Safety Update volume 11 issue 10; May 2018) During 2018, all practices and individual GPs w ill have been sent a pack of information advising them of the need to identify any girl or woman of childbearing potential (this is defined as a pre -menopausal woman who is capable of becoming pregnant) currently being prescribed valproate and setting out a series of actions for health professionals including GPs. Valproate use in pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of children with congenital abnormalities and developmental delay. Valproate is contraindicated in women of childbearing potential u nless the conditions of the valproate pregnancy prevention programme are fulfilled. Whilst the rates of prescribing of valproate continue to decline slowly there are wide geographical variations in prescribing. Clear actions have been set for general pract ices to identify and recall existing patients, provide them with a copy of the Patient Guide, to check they have had a specialist review in the last year and to have systems in place to identify and appropriately manage new patients who are prescribed valp roate and are of child bearing potential. The pregnancy prevention programme requires GPs to: Ensure continuous use of highly effective contraception* in all women of childbearing potential (consider the need for pregnancy testing if not a highly effectiv e method). Check that all patients have an up to date, signed, Annual Risk Acknowledgment Form each time a repeat prescription is issued. Ensure the patient is referred back to the specialist for review, annually. Refer back to the specialist urgently ( within days) in case of unplanned pregnancy ; or where a patient wants to plan a pregnancy. * The Summary of Product Characteristics for valproate states that 'Women of childbearing potential who are prescribed valproate must use effective contraception without interruption during the entire duration of treatment with valproate. These patients must be provided with comprehensive information on pregnancy prevention and should be referred for contraceptive advice if they are not using effective contraception. At least one effective method of contraception (preferably a user independent form such as an intra -uterine device or implant) or two complementary forms of contraception including a barrier method should be used. Individual circumstances should be evalua ted in each case when choosing the contraception method, involving the patient in the discussion to guarantee her engagement and compliance with the chosen measures. Even if she has amenorrhea she must follow all the advice on effective contraception.' For children or for patients without the capacity to make an informed decision, provide the information and advice on highly effective methods of contraception and 105 on the use of valproate during pregnancy to their parents/ caregiver/ responsible person and ma ke sure they clearly understand the content. The practice should regularly use the audit function on their clinical system to identify at risk patients and ensure timely recall for clinical review in line with the MHRA alert. Such continuous measurement ca n be used to demonstrate compliance with the MHRA alert. This improvement programme offers general practice a further opportunity to ensure these actions have been completed and that ongoing systems to protect patients from harm have been put in place. 3. Implementing the plan Practices should implement the improvement plan developed to support their objectives. It is recommended that these plans and associated improvement activities should involve the whole practice team and practices are encouraged to engage with colleagues in community pharmacy where practicable. Practices should undertake continuous improvement cycles to achieve the outcomes they have set themselves. These should focus upon necessary changes to practice systems and processes, staff role s, methods of recording and sharing information as well as reviewing care for individual patients. Continuous measurement is recommended to demonstrate the impact of the changes being tested. The audit cycle should be closed by repeating the audit and clarifying the outcomes achieved. Example case studies can be downloaded from https://www.england.nhs.uk/wp - content/uploads/2019/03/1920 -qof-quality -improvement -case -studies.pdf 4. Network peer review meetings A key objective of the network peer review meetings is the establishment of a system to enable shared learning across Primary Care Networks. The aim of this is to share best practice in pre scribing safety. Contractors should participate in a minimum of two network peer review discussions unless there are exceptional and unforeseen circumstances which impact upon a contractor's ability to participate. Whilst these meetings would usually be f ace to face, networks are able to explore other mechanisms to facilitate real time peer learning and sharing including virtual meetings. The peer review group will usually be the Primary Care Network of which the practice is a member. Where the practice i s not part of a network their peer review group should be agreed with the commissioner. Suggested discussion points for these meetings are made in Box 3. The network clinical lead or their nominated deputy should facilitate these meetings and maintain a r ecord of attendance. It is for the network to determine the timing of these meetings but we would recommend that the first meeting takes place early in the QI activity and the second towards the end. 106 5. Reporting and verification The contractor will complete the QI monitoring template in relation to this module and self-declare that they have completed the activity described in their QI plan. The contractor will also self -declare that they have attended a minimum of two peer review meetings as described above, unless there are exceptional and unforeseen circumstances which impact a contractor's ability to participate. In these circumstances contractors are expected to make efforts to ensure alternative participation in peer review. Verification - Commissioners may require contractors to provide a copy of the QI monitoring template as written evidence that the quality improvement activity has been undertaken. Commissioners may require the network clinical lead to provide written evid ence of attendance at the peer review meetings. If a contractor has been unable to attend a meeting due to exception and unforeseen circumstances then they will need to demonstrate other active engagement in peer learning as review. Box 3. Suggested peer review meeting discussion point s The first peer review meeting should take place early in the QI process and focus upon: Sharing of the outputs of diagnostic work to understand the issues associated with prescribing safety Validation of practice improvement targets Discussion points cou ld include: 1. What relevant evidence -based guidance / quality standards can the group use? 2. What data has each practice used to inform its review of current performance? 3. Has the right focus been chosen by each practice based on their current performance? 4. Has each practice set a clear aim with a challenging but realistic local target, and agreed an appropriate measurement to monitor impact? 5. What ideas for changes is each practice planning to try in an improvement cycle? 6. How are practices ensuring the whole prac tice team (including other clinical colleagues and patients and carers) are engaged in the proposed QI activity? The second peer review meeting should take place towards the end of the QI process and should focus upon: Celebrating successes and sharing of key changes made in practice. How these changes can be embedded into practice. Discussion points could include: 1. What results have each practice seen in their QI activity testing? 2. What changes have been adopted in each practice? 3. How will these changes be s ustained in the future? 4. What new skills have staff developed and how can they be used next? 5. What further QI activity prescribing safety is planned in each practice? 6. What further actions may need to take place (e.g. at network or CCG level) to support the changes in practices? 107 The reporting template is available from should not be included in this template or appended to it. End of life care Indicator Points Achievement thresholds QI003: The contractor can demonstrate continuous quality improvement activity focused on end of life care as specified in the QOF guidance 27 NA QI004: The contractor has participated in network activity to regularly share and discuss learning from quality improvement activity as specified in the QOF guidance. This would usually include participating in a minimum of two network peer review meetings. 10 NA Rationale In 2015 the National Palliative and End of Life Care Partnership published Ambitions for palliative and end of life care: a national framework for local action 2015 -2020 . This quality improvement activity is designed to support practices to respond to those ambitions and to build the foundations needed to provide excellent, holistic and indivi dualised care for all. Identifying patients in need of end of life care, assessing their needs and preferences, and proactively planning their care with them are key steps in the provision of high quality care at the end of life in general practice. There is evidence to suggest that there is the potential for the quality of this care to be improved139. Increased use of healthcare services during this time also occurs often with limited clinical effectiveness and poor experiences for people. Better identifica tion of people in the last year of their life followed by appropriate care planning and support for them are recognised as key elements of good medical practice as set out by the General Medical Council ( Treatment and care towards the end of life: good practice in decision making , 2010). Involving, supporting and caring for all those important to the dying person is also recognise d as a key foundation of good end of life care. As well as being individuals facing impending loss and grief, they often provide a key caring role for the dying person. 139 National Audit Office. End of Life Care: Report by the Comptroller and Auditor General. 2008; available from https://www.nao.org.uk/wp -content/uploads/2008/11/07081043.pdf 108 Overview of the QI module The overarching aim of these QI indicators is to lead to imp rovements in relation to the following aspects of care: 1. Early identification and support for people with advanced progressive illness who might die within the next twelve months. 2. Well-planned and coordinated care that is responsive to the patient's changi ng needs with the aim of improving the experience of care. 3. Identification and support for family / informal care -givers , both as part of the core care team around the patient and as individuals facing impending bereavement. Practices will need to: i. Evaluate the current quality of their end of life care and identify areas for improvement - this would usually include a retrospective death audit (QI003) ii. Identify quality improvement activities and set improvement goals to improve performance (QI003) iii. Implement th e improvement plan (QI003) iv. Participate in a minimum of 2 GP network peer review meetings (QI004) v. Complete the QI monitoring template in relation to this module (QI003 + QI004) The following section includes further detail on the types of things practices could do to deliver this module. These are suggestions only and the decision about what to include in the QI plan and which QI methodologies to use should be made by practices a nd shared with their peers through the network meetings. Detailed contractor guidance 1. Identifying areas for improvement All practices should start with an assessment of the current quality of care they provide for patients and their families at the end of life. This would usually include the completion of a retrospective baseline audit analysis of deaths unless this has been completed in the previous 3 months. Box 4 provides further information about how to do this. The purpose of this is to understand fir stly, the numbers of people who had been identified on the palliative care register and therefore deaths which had been anticipated and secondly, how many patients had care plans in place. If the practice already has well -established end of life care proce ss then this baseline audit analysis could focus upon other aspects of care such as: Priority care goals achieved e.g. is preferred place of death recorded and achieved? Quality of care plans including treatment escalation and advance care plans e.g. legal status of Power of Attorney and advance Directives, and emergency treatment preferences such as recording of decision on cardiopulmonary resuscitation (note evidence suggests that this should be part of the care planning process and not done in isolation) . 109 Main carer is identified with offer of assessment and support Anticipatory medicines are available in the place of care We encourage practices, particularly those with well -established end of life care processes to seek the views of family members / info rmal carers which for example could be done through a survey of carers or a structured interview with one carer or patient every six months to evaluate how well the practice meets their needs and what improvements could be made. Practices may also find it useful to undertake a reflective group meeting and complete a SWOT analysis. Guidance as to how to do this can be found in the acco mpanying RCGP guide How to get started in QI140. Understanding and sharing individual learning experiences and promoting reflective practice as individuals and in groups helps in the creation of a culture of learning and continuous improvement and the ultimate success of any quality improvement activity. 2. Identifying quality improvement activities and setting improvement goals The identification of quality improvement activities should be informed by the results of the retrospective death baseline audit and analysis. Practices should focus their QI activities on delivering improvement across the following four measures : 1. An increase in the proportion of people who die from advanced serious illness who had been identified in a timely manner on a practice 'supportive care register', in order to enable improved end of life care, reliably and early enough for all those who may benefit from support. 2. An increase in the proportion of people who died from advanced serious illnes s who were sensitively offered timely and relevant personalised care and support plan discussions ; documented and shared electronically (with 140 How to do a retro spective death baseline analysis (audit) Practices should review a sample of X deaths over the previous 12 months to establish baseline performance on the areas of care listed above and to calculate their expected palliative care register size. A suggested template to support data collection for the audit can be downloaded from https://www.england.nhs.uk/gp/gpfv/investment/gp -contract/ . The number of deaths each year will vary between individual practices due to differences in the demographics of the practi ce population. Practices could use the number of deaths reported in their practice populations in the previous year to assess how well they are identifying patients who would benefit from end of life care. An audit standard against which to assess current practice would be that the practice was successfully anticipating approximately 60% of deaths. 110 appropriate data sharing agreements in place) to support the delivery of coordinated, responsive care in and out o f hours with key cross -sector stakeholders. 3. An increase in the proportion of people who died from advanced serious illness where a family member / informal care -giver/ next -of-kin had been identified ; with an increase in those who were offered holistic su pport before and after death, reliably and early enough for all those who may benefit from support. 4. A reliable system in place to monitor and enable improvement based on timely feedback of the experience of care from staff, patients and carer perspective s. These measures will be used at a national level to assess the impact of the module. Identification and care planning should be addressed in parallel. Improvement activity should focus on impact. and may include a dedicated focus on specific areas or pa tient groups e.g. the practice may perform well in relation to supporting patients with cancer at the end of life, but could improve in relation to other patient groups e.g. those with respiratory disease, children with life limiting illnesses or people wi th learning disabilities. Practices may also wish to review the RCGP and Marie -Curie Daffodil standards: core Standards for advanced serious illness and end of life care in general practice141 and the NICE QS for End of Life Care in Adults (QS13) and Care o f dying adults in the last days of life (QS144) for further suggestions of appropriate quality improvement activities. For each of the measures, practices should identify and agree their own objectives which are SMART See Box 5 for examples of SMART outcom es. Practices should set their own targets for improvement based upon their baseline audit results. These should be challenging but realistic and recognise that it may be easier to make larger improvements when starting from a modest baseline. These should be validated by network peers as part of the initial network review meeting. 141 https://www.rcgp.org.uk/clinical -and-research/resources/a -to-z-clinical -resources/daffodil - standards.aspx 111 Box 5: Examples of SMART outcomes for each measure Measure 1: Baseline analysis from retrospective audit - 20% of people affected by serious illness and end of life care who died, had already been identified on a practice 'supportive care register'. SMART outcome: Increase from 20% to X% of people affected by serious illness and end of life care who died, to be identified on a practice 'supportive care register', over the nex t 6 months. Measure 2: Baseline analysis from retrospective audit - 10% of people affected by serious illness and end of life care who died , had been sensitively offered timely and relevant personalised care and support plan discussions and these were documented and shared electronically. SMART outcome: Increase from 10% to X% over the next 6 months (practice to decide) and X -Y% over the 6 -12 months (practice to decide) of people affected by serious illness and end of life care who died, to be sensitively offered timely and relevant personalised care and support plan discussions and have these documented and shared electronically. Measure 3: Baseline analysis from retrospective audit - 10% of family members / informal care -givers/ next -of-kin identified on a practice 'supportive care register' were contacted and offered information on dealing with grief and bereavement within 1 month of the person on the register dying. SMART outcome: Increase from 10% to X% (practice to decide) of family members / informal care-givers/ next -of-kin identified on the practice 'supportive care register' to be contacted and offered information on dealing with grief and bereavement within X weeks /months (practice to decide) of the person on the register dying - within a 12 -mont h period. Measure 4: SMART outcomes: To support and reflect on retrospective death audit and practice -relevant QI planning within the 12 -month period, achieving a minimum of: a) 2-5 family/care -giver or patient interviews (See Appendix 1) e.g. semi -structu red discussion, using an agreed template or annual carer survey relevant to EOLC needs. Optional and additional SMART OUTCOMES could include: Staff feedback to support the QI planning (See Appendix 1) e.g. survey MDT feedback to support the QI planning (See Appendix 1) e.g. survey, discussion at MDT 112 3. Implementing the plan Practices should implement the improvement plan they have developed to support the objectives they have identified. It is recommended that these plans and associated improvement activities should involve the whole practice team and practices are encouraged to engage with colleagues in community and related services (such as district nurses, hospice services, and community pharmacy) where practicable. Where possible, patients and their family members and informal care givers should be involved in continuous quality improvement around people affected by advanced serious illness and end of life care. This is especially the case in relation to measures 3 and 4. Practices should undertake continuous improvement cycles to achieve the outcomes they have set for t hemselves in relation to the measures they are focusing on. Example case studies can be viewed at https://www.england.nhs.uk/wp - content/upl oads/2019/03/1920 -qof-quality -improvement -case -studies.pdf 4. GP Network peer review meetings A key objective of the network peer review meetings is to enable shared learning across the network. The aim of this is to improve learning from deaths and the provision of best practice end of life care. It is also intended to provide a forum for practices to identify wider system issues impacting upon care quality which may require a collective response. Contractors should participate in a minimum of two network pe er review discussions unless there are exceptional and unforeseen circumstances which impact upon a contractor's ability to participate. Whilst these meetings would usually be face to face, networks are able to explore other mechanisms to facilitate real t ime peer learning and sharing including virtual meetings. The peer review group will usually be the Primary Care Network of which the practice is a member. Where the practice is not part of a network their peer review group should be agreed with the commi ssioner. Suggested discussion points for these meetings are made in Box 6. The network clinical lead or their nominated deputy should facilitate these meetings and maintain a record of attendance. It is for the network to determine the timing of these mee tings but it is recommended that the first meeting takes place early in the QI activity and the second towards the end. 113 5. Reporting and verification The contractor will need to complete the QI monitoring template in relation to this module and self -declare that they have completed the activity described in their QI plan. The contractor will also self -declare that they have attended a minimum of two peer review meetings as described above, unless there are exceptional and unforeseen circumstances which impact upon a contractor's ability to participate. In these circumstances contractors are expected to make efforts to ensure alternative participation in peer review. Verification - Commissioners may require contractors to provide a copy of the QI monitoring template as written evidence that the quality improvement activity has been undertaken. Commissio ners may require the network clinical lead to provide written evidence of attendance at the peer review meetings. If a contractor has been unable to attend a meeting due to exceptional circumstances then they will need to demonstrate other active engagemen t in network peer learning and review. Box 6: Suggested peer review meeting discussion points The first peer review meeting should take place early in the QI activity and f ocus on: Sharing the outputs of the diagnostic work to understand the issues for each practice about end of life care. Validation of practice improvement targets. Discussion points could include: 1. What relevant evidence -based guidance / quality standards can the group use? 2. What data has each practice used to inform its review of current performance? 3. Has the right focus been chosen by each practice based on their current performance? 4. Has each practice set a clear aim with a challenging but realistic local t arget, and agreed an appropriate measurement to monitor impact? 5. What ideas for changes is each practice planning to try in an improvement cycle? 6. How are practices ensuring that the whole practice team (including other clinical colleagues and patients and c arers) are engaged in the proposed QI activity? The second peer review meeting should take place towards the end of the QI activity and focus on: Celebrating success and sharing of key changes made in practice. Encouraging a compassionate, no -blame and ac tive learning culture. How these changes have been embedded and will be sustained. Discussion points could include: 1. What results have each practice seen in their QI activity testing? 2. What changes have been adopted in each practice? 3. How will these changes b e sustained in the future? 4. What new skills have staff developed and how can they be used next? 5. What further QI activity in end of life care is planned in each practice? 6. What further actions may need to take place (e.g. at network or CCG level) to support t he changes in practices? 114 The reporting template is available from https://www.england.nhs.uk/publication/quality -improvement -module -documentation - end-of-life-care/ . Patient identifiable information should not be included in this template or appended to it. 115 Section 6: Personalised care adjustment As of 1 April 2019, exception reporting is being replaced with a Personalised Care Adjustment (PCA) . This will allow practices to differentiate between the following reasons for adjusting care and removing a patient from the indicator denominator: unsuitability for the patien t, e.g. because of medicine intolerance or allergy, or contra -indicated polypharmacy; patient choice , following a shared -decision making conversation; the patient did not respond to offers of care - recording of this will change to capture actual invitat ions sent to patients; the specific service is not available (in relation to a limited number of indicators only); or newly diagnosed or newly registered patients, as per existing rules. As with exception reporting a pplying a PCA to the patient record w ill remove that patient from an indicator denominator if the QOF defined intervention has not been delivered . It will not result in patients being removed from the disease register or other target population. This mechanism differs from 'exclusions' which refer to patients on a particular clinical register who are not included in an indicator denominator for definitional reasons . For example, an indicator (and therefore the denominator) may refer only to patients of a specific age group, patients with a spe cific status (e .g. those who smoke), or patients with a specific length of diagnosis, within the register for that clinical area. The associated changes to data recording and extraction should result in a redistribution of coding work away from year -end an d provide better information about why patients are not receiving interventions. Principles When considering whether a PCA applies to an individual patient practices are reminded that: the duty of care remains for all patients, the decision to apply a personalised care adjustment should be based on clinical judgement, informed by patient preferences and underpinned by shared decision -making principles , with clear and auditable reasons coded or entered in free text on the patient record there should be no blanket personalised care adjustments : the relevant issues with each patient should be considered by the clinician at each level of the clinical indicator set and this decision reviewed on a regular basis . In each case where a personalised care adjustment is applied then in addition to what needs to be reported for payment purposes (in accordance with the Business Rules), the contractor should also ensure that the reason for the adjustment is fully recorded in a way that can f acilitate both safe and effective patient care and audit of the patient record. For example, where a patient has not tolerated medication, the nature of the contraindication should be recorded in the patient's record as well as a 116 code to indicate intoleran ce. Criteria for the personalised care adjustment Personalisation of care can occur for the following reasons which are listed in the order in which they will be extracted in the Business Rules : 1. The investigative service or secondary care service is unavai lable (where relevant to the indicator) 2. Intervention described in the indicator is clinically unsuitable 3. The patient has chosen not to receive the intervention described in the indicator 4. The patient has not responded to invitations for the intervention des cribed in the indicator ( a minimum of two invitations for the intervention in the preceding 12 months , except for the cervical screening indicators where women should receive a total of three invitations for screening ) 5. The patient has re gistered with the practice or has been newly diagnosed with the condition of interest in the preceding 3 months and has not received the defined clinical measurements e.g. blood pressure measurement 6. The patient has registered with the practice or has been newly diagnosed wi th the condition of interest in the preceding 9 months and has not achieved the defined clinical standards e.g. blood pressure control within target levels. It is recognised that patients may meet more than one of these criteria and i n these circumstances all reasons for personalisation should be recorded in the patient's record to facilitate safe and effective patient care. However, as a patient can only be acknowledged as having a personalised care adjustment once within the Business Rules for a given ind icator, they will be allocated to the first criterion they meet in the hierarchy listed above. For example, where a patient is recorded as having registered with the practice in the preceding 3 months and has also chosen not to receive the intervention des cribed in the indicator they would be identified in the Business Rules as having chosen not to receive the care. The hierarchy listed above seeks to prioritise clinical judgement and patient choice over other criteria. Applying this hierarchy consistently in the Business Rules in conjunction with the recording changes described below will support better attribution of the reason for care being personalised, allowing for more meaningful conversations between clinicians, commissioners and regulators. Interpr etation and recording of the personalised care adjustment The interpretation of these categories and how they should be recorded is detailed further below. The investigative service or secondary care service is unavailable This care adjustment will apply only to the following indicators: HF002, AST002, COPD002, COPD008 and DM014. Where one of these services is unavailable this should be recorded using specific 117 codes which state that the service is unavailable. The contractor is expected to explore fully wi th their CCG, if a suitable investigative or secondary service could be commissioned for the patient prior to entering a service unavailable code in the patient record. The frequency with which service unavailable codes should be added to the patient recor d is noted below and may vary between indicators. Some codes may need to be entered annually whereas others may only need to be entered once in the relevant timeframe stated in the indicator. Table 2: Frequency of data entry Indicator ID Service unavailabl e may be recorded HF002 Within 1 year of diagnosis of heart failure AST002 Required annually COPD002 Required annually COPD008 Required each year the patient becomes eligible for pulmonary rehabilitation DM014 Within 279 days of diagnosis of diabetes Intervention described in the indicator is clinically unsuitable We envisage this being the main reason for personalisation of care, recognising the importance of clinical judgement in determining the applicability of guideline recommendations to individ ual patients. This category encapsulates the historical exception reporting criteria of 1) patients for whom it is not appropriate to review their chronic disease parameters due to particular circumstances e.g. receiving end of life care, 2) those who are on maximal tolerated doses of medicatio n, 3) those who have an allergy, contraindication or adverse reaction to medication, 4) those who have not tolerated medications and 5) where the patient has a supervening condition which would make treatment of thei r condition inappropriate. This criterion will be supported by both generic 'patient unsuitable' codes which will apply to all indicators in the clinical area and more specific codes which can be attributed to single indicators. Over time, more specific c odes will be introduced which define the clinical reasons which might make the intervention clinically unsuitable for an individual patient. Codes which indicate ongoing and permanent reasons for personalisation of care such as allergies to specified medic ation may be entered once in the medical record. Other codes will need to be recorded on an annual basis following an individual patient review of the applicability of the intervention described in the indicator. It is not acceptable to exclude all patients who are under the care of a consultant. Each case needs to be carefully considered and all reasonable efforts made to provide optimal care. 118 Even when a patient is under the care of a consultant only, the contractor should ensure it has evidence th at all the requirements of the contract have been carried out. If this evidence is not available, the contractor should assume that the action has not been carried out and either fulfil the requirements of the relevant indicator(s) or obtain evidence from secondary care that the particular test/check has been carried out. Where the secondary care clinician, in agreement with the primary care clinician, has exercised clinical judgement and decided further action or testing is inappropriate, this should be no ted in the patient record. A personalised care adjustment may them be applied. The patient has chosen not to receive the intervention described in the indicator This criterion requires that there has been a personal contact or a discussion recorded in the patient record which ideally notes the reasons for the intervention being declined . This contact may be face -to-face, video conferencing or telephone contact between a health professional and the patient. This criterion will be s upported by both generic 'informed dissent' codes which will apply to all indicators in the clinical area and more specific codes which can be attributed to single indicators. Practices are encouraged to use more specific codes where they are available. The decision to decline a QOF intervention should be reviewed with the patient on an annual basis and recorded annually if necessary. The exceptions to this are indicators CS005 and CS006 where the choice not to receive the intervention need only be entered once during the time -period stated in the indicator. However, as noted in the underpinning principles , good practice would be to revisit this decision on a regular basis. Women who choose to withdraw from the cervical screening call/recall will receive no further offers of screening from the central screening service. The patient has not responded to invitations for the intervention described in the indicator To be removed from an indicator denominator using this criterion patients must have been sent a mi nimum of two invitations for QOF care at two unique time points in the QOF year i.e. 1 April to 31 March separated by a minimum of seven calendar days . The exceptions to this are indicators CS005 and CS006 where the patient should have been sent a minimum of three invitations at three unique time points during the timeframe stipulated in the indicator. General standards and recording requirements for invitations Many different methods of communication are already available to invite patients for QOF care and these are likely to expand with the ongoing development of digital technology. The NHS also has a legal duty to ensure that patients who have a disability, impairment or sensory loss get information that they can access and understand as set out in the Accessible Information Standard.142 The first step to making an effective invitation for care therefore is that it is made in a manner which 142 https://www.england.nhs.uk/ourwork/accessibleinfo/ 119 is accessible to the patient. Therefore, practices should prospectively and opportunistically record individual pati ents preferred methods of communication, for example at the time of the next patient contact. Where a preferred contact method is recorded this would be used to make the first invitation for care. The second invitation may be via any method. All invitation s should be personalised to the patient i.e. use their name and specify what they are being invited for. Where invitations are being sent via letter or email these should also include information for the patient as to why this care is being offered and its importance for their health care. Invitations should be coded at the time they are sent to the patient. For data extraction purposes, there should be a minimum of seven calendar days between each invitation , but practices should use their judgement in det ermining the optimal spacing between invitations for their practice population. A longer period may be more appropriate. Codes currently exist to indicate the communication method used to make the invitation and further codes will become available during 2 019/20 to indicate that the patients preferred method was used. Both will be acceptable for QOF purposes. Patients should be sent a minimum of two invitations for care within the QOF year i.e. 1 April - 31 March. If these invitations are correctly coded th en they will be identified through the business rules and there will be no need to add additional codes at year -end to indicate that a patient has not responded to these invitations. As at present, generic invitations such as messages added to the right -hand side of prescriptions or notices in the waiting room inviting groups of patients to attend clinics or make appointments will not be acceptable. Invitations for cervical screening As noted above, the requirement for women to be invited on three separate occasions will continue in line with national screening programme requirements. Therefore: In those areas where the first two invitations are sent via the central screening service, then contractors are responsible for offering the third invitation, or Where the central screening service sends out only one letter, then contractors are responsible for offering the second and third invitation. Where contractors have opted to run their own call/recall system then they are responsible for making all three invi tations. Where a woman does not respond to these three invitations then contractors will need to code that this has been the case. A specific code to do this has been requested and will become available during 2019/20. Each invitation should be recorded in the patient record as evidence of these may be required for assessment and audit purposes. Women may choose to withdraw from the national screening programme. This should be undertaken with caution as women who withdraw from cervical screening call/recall will receive no further offers of screening from the central service. Where 120 women actively decline cervical screening, this should be recorded as such. The patient has registered with the practice or been newly diagnosed with the condition in the last 3 months of the QOF year and has not received defined clinical measurements Where a patient newly registers with a practice or is newly diagnosed with a clinical condition in the last three months of the QOF year (1 January - 31 March) this criterion applies automatically, unless the contractor has recorded the defined clinical measurements within the timeframe for the indicator. This is because achievement automatically over -rides any PCA. The patient has registered with the practice or has been newly diagno sed with the condition in the last 9 months of the QOF year and has not achieved defined clinical standards Where a patient newly registers with a practice or is newly diagnosed with a clinical condition in the last nine months of the QOF year (1 July - 31 March) this criterion applies automatically, unless the contractor has achieved the defined clinical standards within the timeframe for the indicator. This is because achievement automatically over -rides any PCA. 121 Section 7: Indicators no longer in QOF (INLIQ) There are minor changes to the INLIQ extraction from 1 April 2019 including the introduction of four new indicators and the removal of six existing indicators.
