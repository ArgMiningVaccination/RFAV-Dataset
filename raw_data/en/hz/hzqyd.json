HALPIN 261 INTRODUCTION Since the beginning of humanity's reign on Earth, warfare and the tools used to effectuate its wrath have long been the determining factors for control and power. As a propensity for violence has developed through more effective means, individuals, cultures, communities , and governments have continuously sought new methods and tools to increase their advantage in conflicts amongst each other. Bow and arrows helped ancient cultures ward off attackers from much farther away than hand -to-hand combat allowed, increasing the dista nce between their loved ones and the incoming dangers.1 The use of gunpowder and explosives enabled armies to fire projectiles with greater speed and lethality.2 Rifled barrels greatly enhanced accuracy, allowing armies to target and eliminate specific fighters and leaders.3 Aircraft and fighter ships allowed a single war to cross large expanses and territories.4 Increasingly powerful artillery and aircraft -delivered explosive ordnances permitted forces to eliminate significant numbers of enemy fighters wit h a single strike.5 The progression in warfare technology culminated with the development of the nuclear bomb, with which entire cities and populations, including innocent civilians, could be wiped out instantaneously from miles away.6 Despite the persiste nt, exponential increases in the power of these man -made weapons, one crucial element blunting their impact was that of human control. Humans can choose which weapon to use, whom to target, and the degree of damage to inflict. More importantly, a user can choose not to deploy their weapons, preventing the 1 See Paul M.

These aspects increase the influence of morality and ethics within the equation, possibly preventing violent attacks for want of the will to implement them. However, one enemy h umanity has always struggled to confront is nature. Natural viruses and bacterial infections have decimated populations without regard for money, power, military strength, race, religion , or political views .7 Diseases spread in various manners, are often i nvisible to the human eye, and are, generally, undetectable until someone is already infected.8 As with any potentially dangerous force, humans have attempted to tame nature and create a tactical advantage for themselves with the destructive effects of the se already -available biological compounds.9 This Comment will examine the development and use of naturally -occurring diseases as biological weapons in modern global warfare and their political implications. This Comment is not meant to instill fear or exag gerate the danger of these weapons to ordinary individuals, but rather to openly discuss potential risks and how they could be mitigated before and after an attack occurs. The objective of this Comment is to demonstrate that the United States, as a primary world power, owes a duty to actively seek cures and treatments for potentially weaponizable, naturally -occurring diseases, as well as a duty to make these treatments available to ordinary citizens. It will examine the legal ramifications, both domesticall y and internationally, of the production and use of such weapons. Further, it will address the crucial aspect of the weaponization of naturally -occurring biologics: the responsibility that developing governments, militaries, or private entities have in ens uring that a cure or treatment is readily available for use by themselves, the citizens of their respective countries or groups, and the innocent people who lie in the zone of danger.

Part III will review the federal and state statutory limitations attempting to curtail, and eventually eliminate, the use of biological weapons. It will als o review global treaties and regulations that have been established in other countries, including actions by the United Nations regarding these issues. Part IV will address the new and significant role terrorism plays in the risks involved with the product ion and use of biological we apons. Part V will then address current and proposed legal provisions dealing with the aftermath of a biological attack. In particular, it will examine the establishment of a new right of access to preventative measures for the general public to better protect itself in the event of biological attack. I. HISTORICAL ANALYSIS A. Ancient Warfare Human civilizations have long used natural resources to increase the lethality of their weapons. Ancient Greeks were known to coat the tips o f their arrows with extracts from poisonous plants found growing in the region.10 Armies in the Middle Ages are believed to have used catapults to fling human corpses infected with Bubonic Plague over their enemies ' walls to drive out the inhabitants throug h fear of contagion.11 As more civilized empires began to exert control over greater areas, however, these practices declined, in favor of formal standing armies and battle formations.12 Civilized nations 10 GILBERT MURRAY , THE RISE OF THE GREEK EPIC 126-30 (Oxford Clarendon Press, 3d ed. 1924) (1907) ( \"There is no doubt whatever that the pr imitive inhabitants of Greece poisoned their arrow -heads. \"). 11 Ercole et al., supra note 9, at 141; see also Mark Wheelis, Biological Warfare at the 1346 Siege of Caffa , 8 EMERGING INFECTIOUS DISEASE J. 971, 973 (2002) ( \"But they ordered corpses to be placed in catapults and lobbed into the city in the hope that the intolerable stench would kill everyone inside. \"). 12 THOMAS S.

HEALTH L. & POL'Y viewed military action as a prideful event, and, thus , frowned upon the barbaric tactics of the past.13 B. World War I and Its Impact At the turn of the twentieth century, worldwide warfare created new incentives to develop significantly more powerful and dangerous weapons to combat the increasing sizes and stre ngths of militaries around the world. The incredible destruction resulting from World War I induced an even greater desire to make weapons more powerful than those of one 's enemies.14 Seeking to tame nature 's power, many countries began developing chemical and biological weapons. Germany became one of the first modern civilized nations to employ biological or chemical weapons in an officially declared war when it deployed mustard gas in World War I.15 With the use of these weapons comes a risk: an entity who uses a biological weapon against others is often just as vulnerable to infection as is the intended target.16 Thus, in order to safely turn naturally - occurring biological compounds into feasible weapons, users should first develop preventative aids to adequ ately protect themselves against the effects before deployment. Mustard gas, though manufactured and not naturally -occurring, poses dangers similar to naturally -occurring weapons, such as damage to the lungs if inhaled, and is just as uncontrollable and indiscriminate against whom it affects.17 In fact, mus tard gas was so difficult to control that many troops were inadvertently exposed, often suffering severe injuries.18 In U.S. v. Cole , a U.S. serviceman who was exposed to mustard gas filed suit against the government 's military insurance programs, 13 Id.; see also WAR, PEACE AND WORLD ORDERS IN EUROPEAN HISTORY 55 (Anja V. Hartman & Beatrice Heuser eds., Routledge 2001). 14 See generally Gerald J. Fitzgerald, Chemical Warfare and Medical Response During World War I , 98 AM. J. PUB.

HALPIN 265 seeking r estitution for damages resulting from that exposure.19 The Court struggled to resolve the issue regarding the serviceman 's coverage because the symptoms sustained from exposure manifested after the expiration of Cole 's military insurance coverage.20 The cour t ultimately determined that the insurance carrier was not liable, due to the delay in becoming symptomatic.21 The Cole decision offers just a glimpse into the difficulties of addressing a weapon that can injure its operators just as easily as its intended targets. Unfortunately, the ruling created no financial incentive for militaries to limit the destructive power of their arsenals. C. Modern Warfare World War II created a rush for even more powerful weapons, culminating in the development and use of the nucl ear bomb.22 The mere threat of such weapons became enough to deter enemies from using their own nuclear arms, leading the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR) and the United States to rush to create large stockpiles of such weapons during the Cold War .23 Both countries viewed chemical and biological weapons as dangerous and destructive enough to warrant stockpiling various forms of them as an additional threat to nuclear armament.24 With the seemingly endless threat of war hanging over their heads, as we ll as the ever -increasing availability of incredibly dangerous weapons held in unstable areas, militaries and governing bodies were forced to develop methods to protect their own soldiers and citizens from the potential devastation that these new weapons could inflict.25 While there is no defense against a nuclear explosion, the damages from biological weapons are slightly more preventable.

II. COMMONLY KNOWN BIOLOGICAL WEAPONS Unlike standard military firearms and chemical weapons, significantly less research and development goes into the weaponization of naturally -occurring biological diseases. While chemical and physical weapons require significant financial backing for development, production, testing, and other highly -technical aspects of manufacture, naturally -occurring diseases develop through evolution without human interaction.27 This makes them particularly troubling because nature has already taken care of most of the development. Many naturally -occurring biological diseases have been employed or researched for potential weaponization.28 Like non - weaponized diseases, each weaponized disease presents its own advantages and disadvantages compared to other potential agents.29 In order to better understand the threats they pose, pre viously -used agents should be reviewed. A. Bubonic Plague ( Yersinia pestis ) In the 1990s, a group of twenty -five experts analyzed the feasibility of turning bubonic plague ( Yersinia pestis or Y. pestis ) into a deployable biological weapon.30 The possible use o f weaponized bubonic plague presents a troubling scenario, given its long history of 26 ED REGIS, THE BIOLOGY OF DOOM : THE HISTORY OF AMERICA 'S SECRET GERM WARFARE PROJECT 81 (Henry Holt 1999). 27 The United States Publishing Office estimated the cost of military weapon development in 2014 to be nearly $63 billion.

Massachusetts .38 Supported by international treaties generating an influx of financial and technical support from throughout the world, the WHO was able to develop a treat ment and prevention protocol that could be easily adapted to various locales.39 By 1980, smallpox had been declared officially eradicated, primarily by the use of large -scale vaccination programs.40 These programs were particularly effective in poorer countr ies, which were more likely to be afflicted with the more -deadly strain of the disease known as Variola major .41 This marked the first time in human history that a disease had been eradicated through human action.42 Since the active threat of smallpox had be en diminished, the period of vaccination for the general public came to a close, especially in the U.S. where individuals were more likely to contract Variola minor , a less -deadly form of the disease.43 This lower risk, as well as the perceived lack of dang er, discouraged Americans from receiving the vaccination; additionally, the cost involved to produce the vaccine seemed unnecessary given the low risk involved.44 Today, no smallpox vaccinations are given to the general population.45 Hence, if the virus were released today, the highly virulent infection could wreak havoc on the world population. Nearly half of the world population has 37 Id. at 419 (quoting Lawrence K. Altman et al., Smallpox: The Once and Future Scourge? , N.Y.

The authors concluded: \"mass vaccination results in both far fewer deaths and much faster epidemic eradication. \"47 If a simple vaccine can eliminate the tactical advantage of weaponized smallpox, why would a government not actively prevent its spread among its citizens? The potential side -effects of the vaccine, including the po ssibilities of contracting the disease or dying from complications, are serious enough to warrant hesitation .48 However, with further research and continued financing, pharmaceutical companies could develop effective vaccines or treatments that limit or eli minate dangerous side -effects. C. Anthrax ( Bacillus anthracis ) Anthrax ( Bacillus anthracis ) is a bacterial infection that was initially weaponized in World War I by the British military.49 Its lethality is well documented, with numerous deaths and injuries re sulting from an accidental release of the bacteria from a Soviet bio -weapons facility in 1979.50 As an illustration of its potency, a single kilogram of anthrax powder has the capability to kill up to 100,000 people depending on the mechanism of delivery.51 46 Smallpox Vaccine Overview , CTRS.

HEALTH L. & POL'Y As was the case with the aforementioned bubonic plague and smallpox, a preventative vaccine for anthrax was developed in 1970.52 Throughout the 1990s, the vaccine was administered to military personnel involved in the Gulf War despite questions about its sa fety and efficacy.53 In 2000, an analysis of the vaccine demonstrated that it was sufficiently effective, and presented low risks of serious side effects.54 After the Amerithrax Letter At tacks (discussed in Part IV , infra ) exposed the risk of anthrax use amo ng the general population, the vaccine was recertified in 2002 by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ( \"FDA \") following changes in its manufacturing process aimed at increasing storage life and effectiveness.55 With these changes, many of the fears and ri sks associated with the anthrax vaccine were greatly diminished or eliminated; with those issues remedied, the vaccine would seem ripe for public distribution. Yet, the primary publically available medical treatment for anthrax remains ciprofloxacin, a com monly available antibiotic given to patients after exposure is confirmed to treat symptoms as they begin to manifest.56 Using antibiotics before exposure is generally frowned upon, as overuse can lead to an increase in bacterial resistance and a decrease in antibiotic effectiveness.57 Thus, while the vaccine can be used as a preventative measure, ciprofloxacin is not an appropriate treatment prior to suspected exposure.

Ebola is not an airborne virus; it spreads solely via direct contact with the bodily fluids (e.g., blood, saliva, semen, or feces) of an infected individual.61 Despite these biological restrictions, the disease has flourished in poor n ations that do not have the infrastructure necessary to decontaminate water supplies contaminated with human waste.62 Countries with strong decontamination protocols and adequate healthcare resources are better prepared to fight the virus and prevent spread ing.63 However, even with one of the strongest and most advanced healthcare systems in the world, two nurses treating the first individual to bring Ebola into the United States contracted the virus in the course of the patient 's treatment.64 Ebola is recogni zed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( \"CDC \") as a \"high priority agent \" that \"can be easily disseminated or transmitted from person to person, result in high mortality rates and have the potential for major public health impact, cause publ ic panic and social disruption, and require special action for public health preparedness. \"65 There is currently no approved cure for http://www.who.int/mediacentre /factsheets /fs103/en/ (last updated Jan. 2016). 59 Id. 60 Id.; see also 2014 Ebola Outbreak in West Africa \u2014Case Counts , CTRS.

While Ebola 's actual effectiveness as a weapon may be limited by the mechanism of infection, the fear and panic likely to result from its deployment could cause major disruption to day -to-day life. With so much a t stake, the U.S. government should devote significantly greater resources towards the continued research and further development of possible treatment avenues. III. LEGAL ASPECTS OF BIOLOGICAL WEAPONIZATION In order to evaluate the responsibility of gove rning entities to protect their citizens, one must examine the relevant legal duties currently imposed upon those entities, both domestically and abroad.

Increased distribution of prophylactic treatment protocols will be discussed in depth infra . B. U.S. Statu tory Provisions 1.

International Action Nations with and without global power have come together on multiple occasions, attempting to elimin ate the threat of military use of chemical and biological weapons. The resulting treaties of many of these meetings offer hope that the great world militaries will curtail the dangers biological weapons present. 1. Geneva Protocol In 1925, following the use o f biological agents in World War I, major world leaders met in Geneva, Switzerland , to discuss the development of a treaty in which all nations would agree to prohibit future use of such weapons.83 These meetings culminated in the Geneva Protocol, the first multilateral disarmament treaty banning the development, production , and stockpiling of biological weapons, went into effect on June 17, 1925.84 The provisions were short, declaring: That the High Contracting Parties, so far as they are not already Parties to Treaties prohibiting such use, accept this prohibition, agree to extend this prohibition to the use of bacteriological methods of warfare and agree to be bound as between themselves according to the terms of this declaration.85 Like many other internati onal treaties, the Geneva Protocol includes no incentives or punishment for failure to ratify the text, nor does it provide for penalties for violations of its measures.86 82 N.R.S. 445A.575 (West 2015). 83 See Protocol for the Prohibition of the Use in War of Asphyxiating, Poisonous or Other Gases, and of Bacteriological Methods of Warfare (Geneva Protocol) , U.S. DEP'T OF ST., http://www.state.gov /t/isn/4784.htm (last updated Sept. 25, 2002). 84 Geneva Protocol, supra note 74. 85 Id.

HEALTH L. & POL'Y Additionally, the U.S. did not ratify the treaty until nearly fifty years later.87 Perhaps more importantly, the U.S. ratification of the Geneva Protocol was subject to an added reservation of its effectiveness: That the said Protocol shall cease to be binding on the Government of the United States with respect to the use in war of asphyxia ting, poisonous or other gases, and of all analogous liquids, materials, or devices, in regard to an enemy State if such State or any of its allies fails to respect the prohibitions laid down in the Protocol.88 The effectiveness of a biological weapons ban treaty that is only followed by other signatory nations may help in conflicts between those nations, but does little to mitigate the dangers of the use of such weapons by or against non -signatory nations or political groups. 2. Biological Weapons Convention The United Nations, perhaps recognizing the ineffectiveness of the Geneva Protocol, further worked to eradicate more modern biological agents from the military realm. The Biological Weapons Convention ( \"BWC \") was opened for signature on April 10, 1972.89 Over 150 state -nation members have signed the treaty, which calls for \"effective progress toward general and complete disarmament, including the prohibition and elimination of all types of weapons of mass destruction, and . . . the prohibition of the developm ent, production and stockpiling of chemical and bacteriological (biological) weapons and their elimination, through effective measures . . .\"90 President Gerald Ford ratified the treaty on March 26, 1975.91 In doing so, the United States promised: [N]ever in any circumstances to develop, produce, stockpile or otherwise acquire or retain: (1) Microbial or other biological agents, or 87 See Geneva Protocol, supra note 74. 88 Id. 89 UNODA, Biological Weapons , UNITED NATIONS , http://www.un.org/disarmament/WMD /Bio/ (last updated Oct. 7, 2014). 90 Convention on the Prohibition of the Development, Production and Stockpiling of Bacteriological (Biological) and Toxin Weapons and on Their Destruction, opened for signature Apr. 10, 1972, 26 U.S.T. 583, 1015 U.N.T.S. 163 [hereinafter (UPDATED ) (DO NOT DELETE ) 10/14/2016 10:10 AM MATTHEW S.

In addition, would development of biological weapons for defensive purposes truly be considered \"prophylactic, protective, or peaceful \" in nature? These questions present significant legal problems that have yet to be addressed in a court of law. Interestingly, while the BWC seeks to ban outright the creation and storage of biological weapons, it contains no provis ions banning the actual use of such weapons, perhaps relying on the Geneva Protocol 's handling of the issue. Further, the BWC fails to establish an international coalition to develop cures or treatments for those weapons that already exist, focusing instea d on \"prohibit[ing] and prevent[ing] the development, production, stockpiling, acquisition , or retention of the agents, toxins, weapons, equipment and means of delivery specified in Article I of the Convention, within the territory of such State, under its jurisdiction or under its control anywhere. \"93 If the global community is going to effectively rid the world of biological warfare, a more effective strategy is needed to attack the problem from both ends. A new international treaty declaring a requirement to actively pursue medical treatments for potential biological agents would create a global incentive to stop diseases in their tracks, encouraging the great world powers \u2014the United States, China, Russia, the European Union, and others \u2014to pool their resou rces for the greater good. Enforcement provisions requiring nation -parties to commit resources to a centralized international fund or organization could significantly increase the availability of new approaches to medical treatment.

Foreign Statutory Provisions Many countries have instituted their own statutory restrictions on biological agents in addition to the pro mises made in the BWC. The United Kingdom prohibits the development, production, stockpiling, acquisition, and retention of \"any biological agent or toxin of a type and in a quantity that has no justification for prophylactic, protective or other peaceful purposes. \"97 Germany prohibits the deployment of biological weapons in any armed conflict, whether domestically or internationally.98 Even Iraq, a country known to have used biological weapons in the 1980s, has promised not to \"use, develop, manufacture 94 Both treaties fail to incentivize eradication of biological agents and instead focus on prohibiting their use in warfare.

IV. TERRORISM IN THE MODERN AGE On September 11, 2001, the United States experienced the first major terrorism attack on U.S. soil to be carried out by a foreign terrorist group. Members of the terro rist group Al -Qaeda traveled to Florida, received pilot training, hijacked four airplanes, and flew them into the two World Trade Center towers in New York City and the Pentagon in Virginia.100 The attacks shocked the nation and brought forth new fears about the safety of Americans within the U.S. borders. Innocent American citizens with no connections whatsoever to the military or government were attacked without any formal declaration of war upon the country. Nearly 3,000 people lost their lives in the attacks.101 Cultivated by non -stop media coverage, an aura of fear overwhelmed the public, with Americans across the country believing that they could be targeted next.102 Congress responded to the September 11th attacks by passing the Authorization for Use of Mil itary Force ( \"AUMF \") which authorized the President to: 99 Marie Colvin & Uzi Mahnaimi, Saddam Tested Anthrax on Human Guinea Pigs , LONDON SUNDAY TIMES (Jan. 18, 1998), https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC UN Doc.

Even if the actual agent used is less than deadly, the public, often uneducated on the realities of diseases, could succumb to panic and cause accidental injuries to others. B. The Anthrax Letters In the months following the September 11th attacks, the threat of a biological attack on American soil was realized when anthrax -laced letters were mailed to multiple news outlets and government officials.111 Five victims died in the 2001 Anthrax mail attacks, dubbed \"Amerithrax \" by the FBI, wit h seventeen others recovering from infection.112 The massive federal investigation that followed led to Dr. Bruce Ivins, an American citizen, as the likely culprit;113 however, no charges were filed against Dr. Ivins, who died of apparent suicide in 2008.114 Though neither a foreign agent nor terrorist, the ease with which Dr. Ivins allegedly spread the biological agent through the postal service demonstrates the ability of bioterrorists to discharge their 109 JEFFREY SIMON , U.S. ARMED FORCES MED.

The primary danger of an anthrax attack is the ease with which one can become infected through simple inhalation of anthrax spores.116 Airborne anthrax is the most likely form to be used in a biological attack, and is the most lethal form of delivery.117 A terrorist could release a concentrated powder or aerosolize d mixture of anthrax spores into the air and rely on wind to carry spores over a large expanse of land.118 Without the need for direct control over the spores once released, a terrorist could then leave the area before personal risk develops. Unfortunately, this type of threat is not merely hypothetical. In the summer of 2015, the terrorist organization \"Islamic State of Iraq and Syria \" (colloquially known as \"ISIS\" or \"ISIL\") was believed to have deployed mustard gas in small amounts against Kurdish fighters .119 While the attacks were limited in size and scope, the ability of a terrorist organization to access chemical weapons and use them in the field diminishes doubt as to the dangers of such an organization utilizing naturally -occurring biological diseases i n a similar manner.120 115 ROYAL SOC'Y, REPORT OF THE RS-IAP-ICSU INTERNATIONA L WORKSHOP ON SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPMENTS RELEVANT TO THE BIOLOGICAL AND TOXIN WEAPONS CONVENTION 10 (Nov. 2006), https://fas.org/biosecurity/resource/documents/rs -iap- icsu%20report.pdf. 116 See Amesh Adalja et al., Clinical Management of Potential Bioterrorism -Related Conditions , 372 NEW ENG.

Ease of Use by Terrorists As the Amerithrax attacks demonstrated, a terrorist could simply place a small amount of anthrax -laced powder into a standard envelope and mail the biological weapon to anyone in the country for the cost of a postage stamp.121 All a potential target would have to do is open the mail and breathe in the powder to be at an extreme risk of infection.122 In response to this danger, the United States Postal Service (\"USPS \") began irradiating all postal mail sent to feder al buildings and offices, including the White House and Congress.123 The irradiation process blasts the envelopes with electron beams or x -rays to destroy the DNA of any organisms inside, thereby eliminating any harmful threat of a biological substance.124 How ever, these protocols are only used on federally -addressed mail and are generally unavailable for the average citizen.125 As a result, most Americans remain at risk should a terrorist group attempt to recreate the 2001 attacks. The potential threat of biolog ical agents traveling by mail manifested itself yet again in early 2015, when live anthrax samples were inadvertently shipped across the country, and overseas, by a military research laboratory.126 While no injuries occurred as a result of the mistake, the f act that such a seemingly well -secured agent could so easily make its way across the globe further demonstrates the dangers posed by biological weapons.127 Unlike most military arms or nuclear weapons, biological agents are often stored in significantly less secure research facilities.128 Without the requirement for design, production, or significant 121 See Amerithrax or Anthrax Investigation , supra note 112. 122 See Adalja et al., supra note 116. 123 OFF.

V. POST-DEPLOYMENT LEGAL REMEDIES In response to the growing threat of biologi cal warfare and bioterrorism, Congress has enacted several programs aimed at reducing both the danger and the effects of a biological attack. A. Project Bioshield Act In 2004, Congress enacted the Project Bioshield Act, which established a $5.6 billion projec t with the goal of developing strategic reserves of therapeutics and vaccines against known biological agents in a new Strategic National Stockpile.132 According to the CDC, the Strategic National Stockpile stores enough vaccines to immunize every American i n the event of a biological attack.133 However, a prophylactic vaccine is entirely ineffective for an individual 's immune 129 See, e.g. , Jamie Doward, Top Secret Military Warning on Ebola Biological Weapon Terror Threat , GUARDIAN (Feb. 21, 2015), Security: 10 Years After the 9/11 Attacks , AIR LINE PILOTS ASS'N, INT'L (Sept. 8, 2011), http://www.speednews.com /speednews_files /data /2041.pdf. 131 Dana Ford, First Diagnosed Case of Ebola in the U.S. , CNN (Sept. 30, 2014), http:// www.cnn.com/2014/09/30/health/ebola -us/. 132 Project Bioshield Act of 2004, Pub.

HALPIN 285 system if it is administered after contracting the disease it is meant to prevent.134 Further, vaccines are not immediately effective, as the immune system takes time to develop immunity to newly introduced foreign organisms.135 Without an active vaccination program, the American public is essentially left unprotected until the danger has already hit. The theoretical strategic advantage of lar ge stockpiles ready to be put into action is clear, as the production time for new vaccines would no longer be an issue when the drugs have already been produced and stored for future use. \"However, strains can easily mutate and become resistant to stockpi led vaccines; long -term reserves of therapeutics tend to be unstable; and large -scale manufacturing of therapeutics takes one to three years using traditional techniques. \"136 Without a stable and trustworthy system for quick dissemination of therapeutic comp ounds, innocent civilians remain unprotected from the threat of biological release. The Project Bioshield Act expired in 2014 after a statutory ten -year effective period.137 Congress provided extended funding in 2013 and 2014 to keep the program available; h owever, without a stable and lasting extension, the future of the program is unclear.138 134 Id. 135 Understanding How Vaccines Work , CTRS.

Military Protection Procedures The military, given its heightened risk of exposure if biological agents are deployed by an enemy force, often requires servicemen and servicewomen to undergo prophylactic treatment against a variety of possible contagions.139 However, these treatments are not always fully developed before being administered, possibly due to lack of ability to test them or lack of appropriate oversight during their development, given the legal concerns regarding defense research of known biological agents.140 In Doe v. Sullivan , the D.C. Circuit Court resolved a question regarding the legality of administering unapproved medical drugs to military personnel for pr otection against chemical and biological agents.141 Judge Ruth Bader Ginsburg, sitting on the Circuit Court just two years before her appointment to the Supreme Court, ruled that informed consent was not required for the DOD to administer unapproved investig ational drugs to military personnel.142 The Sullivan ruling centered on an FDA regulation permitting the DOD to make a determination that informed consent was \"not feasible in certain battlefield or combat -related situations. \"143 This regulation was an attempt to relieve the restrictions set by the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act ( \"FDC&A \") and prior FDA regulations requiring informed consent from any recipient of an investigational drug.144 The serviceman in Sullivan challenged the DOD 's argument that the dangers of war created a situation in which informed consent was not feasible.145 He argued that the administration of the drug without his consent constituted a violation of the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment.146 139 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 360bbb -3(b)(1)(B) (2012). 140 Doe v.

HALPIN 287 The Court, while recognizing the ques tionability of the new regulations, determined that the ambiguities in the language of the statute required deference to the agency 's interpretation, not the court 's judgment.147 Furthermore, the court agreed with the agency 's argument that \"administering the drugs uniformly prevents unnecessary danger to troops and medical personnel from injury to, or the death of, fellow military personnel in battle. \"148 Additionally, \"the DOD [had] an interest in successfully accomplishing the goals of Operation Desert Sto rm.\"149 These goals satisfied the constitutional requirements of the Fifth Amendment, thus defeating the constitutional challenge.150 The Sullivan ruling demonstrated the complexities in preventing the dangers of biological weapons among the military. More com plex, still, is the question of how to prevent their disastrous effects from reaching the general public. As Professor James Hodge Jr. notes, \"there is no central public health system in the United States. Instead, a collaborative workforce of federal, sta te, and local authorities work in conjunction with other inter -level agencies . . . to accomplish public health outcomes. \"151 This vast separation of power and authority complicates the development of a single, unified plan to address the dangers of biologic al weapons. C. Protecting the Public - A New Approach The Department of Homeland Security ( \"DHS \"), established following the September 11th Attacks, present a prime opportunity for the federal government to take action to mitigate the dangers posed by natural ly-occurring biological diseases.152 Tasked with \"secur[ing] the nation from the many threats we face, \" DHS is properly positioned to 147 Id. at 1381 -82 (citing Chevron U.S.A. v.

HEALTH L. & POL'Y coordinate a response to biological attacks.153 By federalizing the response, the military medical and weapons research comple x can become involved, with its vast supply of protective gear and protocols. Additionally, governors can declare a state of emergency in their respective states, permitting the involvement of the National Guard and its resources.154 Standardized treatment p rotocols developed by the CDC can be required in every hospital and treatment facility, and the public 's fears can be mitigated by the knowledge that there is a plan in action and known steps to follow. Relying on and taking advantage of the federal govern ment 's vast resources would be valuable. Consolidating these research and funding responsibilities within the federal government would permit greater control over the national response to the release of biological weapons, enabling faster and more effectiv e means of medical treatment and other time -sensitive actions to mitigate the damage. However, these issues only address steps taken after the release has already occurred. To greater protect the public before any such release, a more effective strategy might be to markedly expand the funding given to research for preventative measures. D. New Legislative Options In order to better protect citizens from the devastating effects of an intentional release of a biolog ical agent, Congress should pass new legislation that addresses the constantly changing nature of modern warfare. Legislative action may not prevent foreign militaries or terrorist organizations from attempting an attack on the United States; however, effe ctive response systems, if established now, will reduce the time and confusion inherent in administering needed aid in the aftermath of an attack. 1.

HALPIN 289 significantly increase the public 's preparedness in the event of a biological release. While the DOD is permitted to research biological warfare agents to develop prophylactic measures, the results are rarely made public, and are often of little use to the average citizen.155 This is not to suggest that the federal government is not actively and diligently researching preventative measures; the NIH, CDC, and other federal agencies are constantly pressing forward with new research and medical applications.156 Rather, the argument is that such research should not be used solely for military defense purposes, but instead should be viewed more broadly as a public health matter. While a strategic reserve of pharmaceutical treatments is indeed a positive step, such a system is unlikely to work well in an atmosphere of panic th at is likely to set in following a release of biological weapons. Much like the mad d ash of individuals rushing into various retail stores on Black Friday, the lines at various vaccine distribution centers would likely be far too large to maintain civility and control over those anxious to receive their vaccinations.157 Price, method of paym ent, insurance payouts, priority of who should receive treatment first, and other logistical issues will have to be analyzed and resolved quickly, often by bureaucrats with little or no medical education.158 Rather than having politicians and military leader s make these crucial healthcare decisions in times of crisis, Congress should greatly expand the Project Bioshield Act by establishing greater civilian access to these preventative vaccines and treatments before disaster strikes, thereby reducing the secur ity-oriented restrictions currently in place.159 155 50 U.S.C. \u00a7 1522 (2012). 156 See, e.g. u pdated Apr. 9, 2015). 157 See Aylward v.

Civilian Rights of Access The development of a new legal right of access for the general public to obtain preventative medicines and physical protective equipment regardless of actual or current risk of exposu re would allow individuals to protect themselves in a timely manner without reliance on the bureaucratic processes currently required to distribute these items. These vaccines would be treated like any other preventative vaccine. For example, just like the influenza vaccine, the smallpox or anthrax vaccine could be obtained from an individual 's physician or pharmacy at that individual 's discretion.160 Costs of these vaccines could be determined by the open insurance market, with higher -risk individuals receiv ing higher compensation rates. In a time of emergency, the federal government, under the direction of the Department of Health and Human Services, could subsidize these costs to increase ease of access for underprivileged Americans. Post - infection treatmen ts could be handled like antiviral medications used to treat influenza, which require a simple prescription from a physician and can be picked up at any local pharmacy.161 This establishment of access rights would not require mandatory vaccinations, but rath er would allow each individual \u2014and their physician \u2014to decide whether vaccination is appropriate.162 Of course, it will take time to establish safe and effective vaccines and ensure the supply is sufficient to withstand the rush for vaccinations following any sort of outbreak. However, by making the government 's resources available to third -party pharmaceutical companies and distribution centers, this supply could build up quickly and be immediately available for distribution in the case of an emergency, witho ut reliance on the Strategic National Stockpile and its bureaucratic restraints. Supply would be crucial for any elective 160 Cf.

CONCLUSION As we press further into an age where every individual is aware of the threa t of terrorism and war, the United States must continue to recognize the threat that intentionally weaponized biological organisms pose. However, recognition is not enough. If \"Homeland Security \" is to truly exist, and not be just another government entity, we must address the threat head -on with full faith and effort. Natural organisms, like terrorists, do not follow laws or international treaties. Worse than terrorists, however, biological agent s do not follow any leader, text, or code; they cannot be guided, and they do not discriminate. If our government wishes to protect us, it must renew the once -vigilant work towards developing cures and treatments for the effects of biological weapons. This not only includes conducting research and studies, but requires real -world protections and preventative protocols as well. The United States should renew vaccination programs for currently relevant biological threats. It should heavily increase funding fo r the NIH, the CDC, and other medical institutes and physicians who devote their lives to saving others. Most importantly, it should provide these life -saving vaccines, treatments, and preventative equipment to any entity in need, whether it be third - world countries or American citizens who just wish to protect themselves should the unimaginable occur. We can proactively fight these diseases. In doing so, we can prevent those who seek to turn naturally -occurring viruses and bacteria into highly destructive weapons from being successful. 163 Robert J.
