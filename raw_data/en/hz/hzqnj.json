Despite its increasing frequency, there is still a lack of safe and effective treatment options. Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) herbal treatment is gaining medical attention as a potential alternative to disease treatment. Speci\u0000cally, biomolecular interactions of the usage of paired herbs could yield essentially synergistic effects on the \u0000ght against obesity. Objective: This study aims to investigate the combination of core herbs and clustering patterns in obesity treatment using various data mining techniques. Methods: Eight electronic databases were searched from inception until December 2021 and 34 Randomized Control Trials (RCTs) were identi\u0000ed. Subsequently, 96 different herbs were extracted from the RCTs for association analysis and hierarchical clustering. The quality assessment of the trials was conducted using the Cochrane Collaboration's Risk of Bias Tool. Results: Association analysis identi\u0000ed herb meaningful clustering patterns amongst herbs based on similar therapeutic effects and meridian entry. Conclusion: Using an integrated approach of systematic review and data mining techniques has revealed core herbs for the treatment of obesity. However, more clinical trials/clinical studies are required to validate the clinical e\u0000cacy of the core herb combination. 1. Background Obesity is a complex condition that can be caused by a variety of factors, such as environmental exposure, genetics, or lifestyle choices (1). It is characterized by abnormal fat accumulations that can affect health and can be assessed using the Body Mass Index (BMI), with a BMI 25 indicating overweight and a BMI 30 indicating obesity (2). Excess body fat disrupts body balance and metabolism, resulting in undesirable health complications and psychological concerns such as low self-esteem and con\u0000dence (3, 4). According to the World Health Organization, obesity has nearly tripled globally since 1975. In 2016, more than 1.9 billion adults aged 18 and older were overweight, with over 650 million of these obese (2). Hence, it is a growing public health threat that needs to be addressed. One current treatment option is to encourage behavioral change. However, weight loss based on behavioral changes might be di\u0000cult to maintain once the body has experienced adaptive biological responses (5). The rate of relapse is high and more than 90% of people who lose weight from dieting regain it in 3-5 years (6). Another current treatment option is weight loss surgery and the use of pharmacological drugs such as Sibutramine and Orlistat, but there is the possibility of developing harmful physical side effects (7). Hence, there is a growing need to develop safer and more reliable alternatives to obesity treatment. TCM herbal treatment is a potential alternative gaining medical recognition. It has an established history in treating various chronic diseases, and two of its main advantages are its medicinal properties and disease treatment approach (1). Exploring the use of TCM herbs could be effective for obesity as TCM herbs contain various biomolecular compounds with medicinal properties such as antioxidant and antiangiogenic capabilities (8, 9). Using multiple herbs together could produce synergistic biomolecular interactions essential in combating obesity (9). Herb-based alternative therapies are also gaining popularity and medical recognition, with increased manufacture of pharmaceuticals such as herb-based antibiotics and antimalarials (10). Page 3/24Additionally, TCM adopts a holistic approach to disease treatment through evaluation and treatment of manifestations and root causes. TCM views obesity as a disease arising from spleen and kidney de\u0000ciency and liver depression, with phlegm, dampness, heat, and blood stasis as standard manifestations (11). Therefore, before deciding on a course of treatment, physicians will use diagnostic TCM approaches like observation, listening, questioning, and pulse analysis to determine the root cause (12). Thus, TCM could be advantageous in obesity treatment. In recent years, data analytics has seen increased use in medical and healthcare research. Examples of application in TCM-related research include machine learning for medical diagnosis, network-based deciphering of the mechanism of action of TCM, prescription analysis, and data mining (13). Association rule analysis is one data analytics tool that seeks to provide insights on item set frequency and association rule patterns by studying variables such as support, con\u0000dence, and lift (14). Unsupervised hierarchical clustering is another data analysis tool that divides data into meaningful clusters and provides insights into cluster similarities. Through association rule analysis and hierarchal clustering, this study attempts to reveal common patterns of usage and rules that yield effective core herb combinations. 2. Methods 2.1 Literature search and data sources This study was reported according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines (15). Eight electronic databases (PubMed, World Cochrane Library, ProQuest, CNKI, Wanfang Data and Scopus) were searched from inception until December 2021. Keywords used \"Chinese Herbal Medicine\", For different databases, search terms and relevant \u0000lters were adjusted accordingly for data retrieval. Only articles were included. The search strategy can be found in Supplementary Table A in the section titled 'Supplementary Information'. Hand-searching was also performed by examining the reference list of the retrieved studies. 2.2 Eligibility criteria The inclusion criteria for this study are as follows: (1) RCT; (2) Participant Characteristics: Overweight or obese participants diagnosed according to the standard cutoff points for body weight, BMI, and/or waist circumference; (3) Intervention: Herbal formulas or medication consisting of two or more herbs; (4) Outcome Measures: Included body weight, BMI, and/or waist circumference as outcome measures. The following articles were excluded: (1) Non-RCT; (2) Population: Did not specify diagnostic criteria for inclusion of obesity or overweight participants; (3) Intervention: Used a single herb ingredient or extract, or did not specify treatment details including ingredients, dosage, and frequency of herbal formula used, or identical herb composition used in the administered formulas; (4) Outcome Measure: Did not include body weight, BMI, and/or waist circumference as outcome measures. 2.3 Selection of studies and data extraction The EndNote software was used to manage the retrieved studies. The studies were initially imported into EndNote to remove duplicates using the built-in \"Find Duplicates\" feature. All references with the same title and author and published in the same year and/or the same title and author and published in the same journal, would be eliminated. Page 4/24A \u0000rst screening was then performed by two independent screening reviewers (YJCN and KSL) based on the titles and abstracts of all articles. Irrelevant studies, such as non-clinical trials, animal studies and those without obesity-related outcomes, were excluded. Any disagreement was resolved by discussion among the two reviewers. After the \u0000rst screening, preliminary included articles were screened based on their full texts. They were further assessed according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria, and the eligible studies were included in the meta-analysis. A detailed \u0000ow of this process is illustrated in Figure 1 below. 30 RCTs were identi\u0000ed during the data collection process. Additionally, four RCTs were identi\u0000ed through hand search. Subsequently, the 34 RCTs were examined, and relevant information was then extracted from the studies. Relevant information included the \u0000rst author and year of publication, country of study, demographics of participants, the name of the herbal formula (if applicable) and the individual herbal composition of the formula. The Plants for a Future (16), Global Plants (17), and Traditional Chinese Medicine Integrative Database (18) databases were used to develop a common naming knowledge base due to different naming practices in diverse studies. Subsequently, the herb nomenclature was standardized before converting the relevant data into Microsoft Excel \u0000le formats for association and hierarchical cluster analysis. Microsoft Excel 2020 and R Studio version 4.1.0 were used for data processing and subsequent analysis in this study 2.4 Statistical analysis 2.4.1 Association analysis The Apriori algorithm is an association rule mining algorithm that identi\u0000es frequent individual item sets in a database. Apriori algorithm-based association rule analysis provides comprehensive and intuitive results to determine association rules highlighting general trends in the database (19). The Apriori algorithm contains an antecedent and a consequent set, both of which are a set of items. The key parameters involved in the mining of association rules are support, con\u0000dence, and lift. As shown in the formula below, X Y is an association rule where X (left-hand side [LHS]) and Y (right-hand side [RHS]) represent the set of herb items. represents the frequency of an item. Support refers to the percentage of records that hold the union of X and Y to the total number of records (N). Con\u0000dence is the percentage of the number of transactions that contain the union of X and Y to the total number of records that includePage 5/24X. It also measures the strength of the association rule. Lift is the ratio that the probability of herb Y appears in the presence of herb X to the frequency of herb Y. It also refers to the validity of the rules. Lastly, Coverage in the Apriori algorithm refers to the fraction of all records that satisfy the antecedent of a rule, represented by the support of LHS of the rule. It represents a measure of to how often the rule can be applied (20, 21). For this study, 12 association rules were investigated. A 'for loop' was generated to \u0000nd out the number of rules for various support (0.05, 0.75, 0.10) and con\u0000dence levels (0.10, 0.20). 0.30, 0.40, 0.50, 0.60, 0.70, 0.80, 0.90), and plotted onto a graph using R Studio. The minimum values of 0.05 and 0.75 for support and con\u0000dence, respectively, were selected. Amongst the association rules, the highest value was only 0.0882, and hence 0.05 was selected as the value for support. Additionally, the con\u0000dence values for overall association rules were high and all greater than 0.5, hence 0.75 was selected for the value of con\u0000dence. Applying these two parameters produced the 12 association rules. 2.4.2 Hierarchical clustering analysis Hierarchical clustering is an unsupervised machine learning technique capable of identifying patterns from unlabeled data (22). For this study, hierarchical clustering was used to reveal meaningful classi\u0000cations of herbs used in the 34 RCTs. The Manhattan distance metric calculates the distance between real-valued vectors and is effective on high-dimensional datasets with discrete or binary attributes (23). The study data set is a high-dimensional one, which justi\u0000es the application of the Manhattan distance metric (24). The value of k = 9 was selected because it produced meaningful cluster sizes ranging from one to three herbs. This closely matches the study objective to interpret herb pairings. Lastly, the average linkage method was selected, as it balances single- and complete linkage clustering by eliminating the effect of outliers in cluster grouping, which could be the closest (chaining effect) or the furthest point (25). 2.5 Risk of bias assessment To ascertain the validity of eligible randomized trials, two review authors assessed potential risks based on their independent judgement .The risk of bias assessment was carried out using Review Manager 5.4 software (26). Random sequence generation (selection bias), allocation concealment (selection bias), selective reporting (reporting bias), blinding of participants and personnel (performance bias), blinding of outcome assessment (detection bias), incomplete outcome data (attrition bias) and other bias were all investigated. Within each of the 34 RCTs, each domain was then assigned a \"low,\" \"high,\" or \"unclear\" risk of bias. 3. Results 3.1 Study characteristics For this study, we refer to Horng et al's classi\u0000cation of age groups (27). The age groups are as follows: (baby: 0-2 years, Young Old Adults: 60-99 years). For classi\u0000cation, the average age group was used. The Baby age group was not represented in any of the 34 RCTs. Middle-aged adults had the highest representation (22 RCTs), followed by young adults (9 RCTs) and old Adults (3 RCTs). The results are depicted in Figure 2Page 6/24(A). Figure 2 (B) shows the percentage representation of male and female participants. Females had a higher representation (65%) than males (35%). The geographical distribution of the 34 RCTs is shown in Figure 2 (C). 25 studies were from Asia (Japan, China, India, Thailand, Korea, Taiwan), 3 from Oceania (Australia), 3 from North America (USA), 1 from Europe (France), 1 from Central Africa (Cameroon), and 1 from the Middle East (Iran). 3.2 Herbal Composition This study examined 34 RCTs in total. Supplementary Table B contains a summary of the herbs utilized in the preceding investigations. 3.3 Distribution of herbs used The 34 RCTs yielded 96 distinct herbs and the top 20 herbs by usage frequency are displayed in Figure 3 above. Ten herbs have a relative frequency greater than the Apriori algorithm, the following diagrams (Figures 4, 5, 6, and Table 1) were generated. They can be found in the following sections. 3.4.1 Association rules of herb pairings Herb prescriptions in clinical practice are usually a combination of multiple herbs. Aside from establishing synergistic biomolecular interactions, the toxicity of other prescribed herbs could be reduced, boosting the prescription's safety (28). For this study, herb pairings were investigated. The Apriori algorithm derived 12 association rules from the herbal formulations utilized in the 34 RCTs. The association rules were plotted with lift (y-axis) against support in a scatter plot (x-axis). The con\u0000dence value determined the color of each regulation. Figure 4 depicts the scatter plot, while Table 1 describes the 12 association rules. Table 1: Summary of 12 rules obtained from Apriori association analysis.Page 7/24Rule LHS 4.857143 3 Table 1 shows that the lift values of the 12 rules range from 3.19 to 8.50, with all being greater than 1. Hence, the likelihood of selecting the antecedent (LHS) and consequent (RHS) acupoints in the same formula was signi\u0000cantly greater than that of selecting the consequent (RHS) acupoint alone. Similarly, the dot values for all 12 rules' con\u0000dence ranged between 75% and 100%. Hence, the likelihood of selecting the subsequent (RHS) acupoint when the antecedent (LHS) acupoint is reasonably high for each rule. The dot values for the rule support levels range from 5.58 percent to 8.82 percent, suggesting that the frequency of each antecedent (LHS) acupoint occurring in the formula ranges from 5.58 percent to 8.82 percent. From our analysis, the highest support level was 0.0833. The rules with the highest support level were rules 3, 4, 10, 11 and 12. The highest con\u0000dence level was 1.00 and the corresponding rules were rules 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 and 12. The highest lift value was 9.00 and the corresponding rules were rules 5 and 8. Hence, evaluating these three parameters suggests the presence of a core list of herb combinations for the treatment of obesity. Lastly, the coverage values ranged from 0.0588 to 0.1176. From our analysis, the rules with the highest coverage value of 0.1176 were rules 10 and 11, hence suggesting that the combinations of most often applied rules. 3.4.2 Core herb combinations Figure 5 shows a group matrix diagram that was generated. Similar rules were gathered and depicted in various sizes of circles, illustrating the general distribution of the association rules. The LHS is represented by the X-axis, whereas the RHS is represented by the Y-axis. The varying sizes of the circles show the levels of support, while the color represents the lift. Hence, the larger the circle the larger the support, the darker the circle the higher the lift (strength). Page 8/24To visualize the association rules, a network diagram was also created. This is depicted in Figure 6 below. The colored circles represent the rules, while the preceding and following arrows are the LHS and RHS, respectively. The color depth of the circles represents the lift value (strength of the relationship) of the rules, while the size of the circles represents the selected as the six core herbs in Figure 5. These herbs were commonly used with other herbs. Poria cocos with Salvia miltiorrhiza are a few examples of pairings. Figure 6 depicts a primary network comprised of seven cocos). As a result, they are more likely to be used in conjunction with other herbs. 3.5 Hierarchical clustering analysis Based on the item frequency plot generated in Figure 3, the top 20 herbs of highest usage frequency in obesity treatment were used to create a cluster dendrogram. The cluster numbers were manually annotated adjacent to the colored clusters for ease of visual inspection. This is depicted in Figure 7 below. According to TCM theory, there are different approaches for classifying herbs. For this study, the herbs were categorized by therapeutic effect and/or meridian entry for cluster analysis. Meridian entry is de\u0000ned as the orientation of the medicinal action to the meridian/channel via which the therapeutic action occurs. There are twelve meridians in the human body according to the meridian and collateral theory. They are the lung meridian (LU), large intestine meridian (LI), stomach meridian (ST), spleen meridian (SP), heart meridian (HT), small intestine meridian (SI), bladder meridian (BL), kidney meridian (KI), pericardium meridian (PC), triple energizer meridian (TE), gallbladder meridian (GB) and the liver meridian (LV). Cluster 1: This cluster consists function to dry dampness. Atractylodes lancea builds on this main function to dry dampness to fortify the spleen. On the other hand, Polygonum multi\u0000orum has a main function to tonify, and it serves to tonify the blood to fortify the liver. Cluster 2: This o\u0000cinale target the lung meridian (LU) and spleen meridian (SP). They have a common therapeutic effect to dry dampness, while Astragalus membranaceus can induce diuresis to alleviate edema and Zingiber o\u0000cinale can resolve phlegm. Next, Salvia miltiorrhiza can activate blood and dispel (blood) stasis. Lastly, Anemarrhena asphodeloides is able to clear heat, tonify Yin and moisten dryness. Cluster 3: Cluster 3 consists of Panax ginseng (Renshen), and Citri reticulatae pericarpium (Chenpi). The main function of the herbs in these two clusters is to target the spleen meridian and tonify the spleen. In addition, both herbs are also able to promote the smooth \u0000ow of Qi within our body. Clusters 4, 5 and 9: Cluster 4 consist of Scutellaria baicalensis (Huangqin) 9 consists of Coptis chinensis (Huanglian). The main therapeutic effect of the herbs in these three clusters is to clear heat. Building on the main therapeutic effect, Scutellaria baicalensis,Page 9/24Coptis chinensis and Phellodendron amurense can clear heat and dry dampness, while Rheum palmatum can clear heat to purge \u0000re and cool the blood. Cluster 6: Cluster 6 key components of a well-known TCM formula \"Gui-Zhi-Tang''. This formula is usually paired with other spleen tonifying and/or dampness draining herbs in the treatment of \"de\u0000cient obesity\" (29) Clusters 7 and 8: Cluster 7 consists of Ephedra sinica (Mahuang) and Coix lacryma-jobi (Yiyiren). (Fuling), and Atractylodes macrocephala (Baizhu). The main therapeutic effect of the herbs in these three clusters is to dry dampness. Building on the main therapeutic effect, these herbs have specialized effects to target different aspects of dampness. Ephedra sinica can induce diuresis to alleviate edema. Coix lacryma-jobi diuresis to drain dampness. Atractylodes macrocephala is also known in Traditional Chinese pharmacy as a \"key herb to fortify the spleen\". Hence, these observed therapeutic effects and Meridian entry of the above top 20 herbs are in line with TCM views of obesity. 3.6 Risk of bias assessment Figure 8 depicts the risk of bias assessment for the 34 RCTs. A green circle represents a low risk of bias, a yellow circle represents an unclear risk of bias, and a red circle represents a high risk of bias. Figure 9 depicts the risk of bias graph. It displays a summary of each risk of bias item as a proportion of all included studies. Visual analysis shows the 34 RCTs having an overall low risk of bias. 4. Discussion Obesity is a major risk factor for a variety of health issues, including cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes mellitus, cancer, osteoarthritis, and depression (3, 30). Aside from medical complications, obesity may result in increased economic costs such as direct costs such as medical treatment and indirect costs such as decreased productivity and quality of life (2). RCTs on TCM herbal treatment for obesity have shown its e\u0000cacy in the treatment of obesity in recent years. As a result, this study was carried out to investigate novel combinations and prescription regularities in the treatment of obesity. This study adopts a unique approach to data mining by incorporating systematic review, association analysis, and hierarchical clustering. The use of RCTs rather than individual patient data in this study avoided the potential limitation that individual patient data in TCM is often not uniform in terms of TCM diagnoses and e\u0000cacy reporting. To the best of our knowledge, this is the \u0000rst study to evaluate multiple herbs and likely core patterns of usage in the treatment of obesity in both prescription formulae and pharmaceuticals. Risk of bias analysis also shows that the studies have a low overall risk of bias, indicating that the RCTs analyzed had a stronger research design overall (31). However, one potential drawback could be that eligible studies were only sourced from English and Chinese language databases. As a result, research from other language databases may be underrepresented, and the conclusions may be overgeneralized. Hence, future research could explore using different language databases to include a broader range of papers for analysis. In terms of demographics, a skew in representation towards Middle-aged individuals (64.7%) was observed. Females were also more represented (65%) than males (35%). This \u0000nding is consistent with research published by the InternationalPage 10/24Union of Nutritional Sciences, which revealed that obesity rates peak around the middle years of life (around 40 years old). Obesity was also found to affect more women than men in most countries (32). Additionally, the Baby age group was not represented, which could be related to the fact that obesity in this age range is uncommon. The presence of early-onset obesity could be attributed to rare hereditary illnesses such as Prader-Willi Syndrome rather than environmental or behavioral causes (33). Geographically, there is a signi\u0000cant skew in distribution, with 26 RCTs coming from the Asia region (76.5%). This may be explained by TCM's origins. TCM is the oldest medical system in Asia, and it was the only medical profession in China until the early nineteenth century. Over time, TCM has also found its way into various Asian cultures, such as Kampo (Japan) and Koryo medicine (Korea) (34, 35). Due to their long-standing heritage, Asian countries are likely to have conducted more research into TCM use. Hence, to minimize the under-representation of TCM use in other countries, future studies could include and investigate TCM herbal use in other non-Asian countries. core herbs in obesity treatment. Usage of these core herbs has also been documented in animal and cellular studies, showing the potential of TCM for obesity treatment. A summary of their mechanisms of action (MOA) is summarized in Table 2 below. TCM herbs, as demonstrated in recent research, include a variety of biomolecular components that may be useful in addressing obesity-related processes. For example, Ning et al discovered that Palmatine, found in Coptis chinensis, exhibits hypolipidemic and anti-adipogenic activities, which may result in anti-obesity effects. Jung et al. also demonstrated that Tanshinone I derived from Salvia miltiorrhiza could inhibit the AMPK signaling pathway and regulate early adipogenic transcription factors, potentially inhibiting early adipogenesis and having anti-obesity effects.

Lowers adipocyte differentiation However, in addition to individual MOAs for obesity treatment, the established core network that have yet to be identi\u0000ed and clinically con\u0000rmed. Past studies have also shown that the heterogeneity of patient conditions may lead to differing herb interactions amongst patients, making it di\u0000cult to determine optimal usage conditions and potential harmful side effects (11). Although the herbal formulae and combinations used in the RCTs were found to provide some weight loss, a different herb combination may cause unknown harmful side effects or have wholly different therapeutic bene\u0000ts. Hence, more research into the unique core network is advised before clinical use. As seen in past animal studies, TCM herbs could be a potential source of novel therapeutics for obesity treatment. Biomolecular compounds in herbs have been shown to in\u0000uence pathways and produce anti-obesity effects. Hence, future studies could also investigate e\u0000cient biomolecular extraction methods to produce novel herb-based pharmaceuticals. 5. Conclusion With obesity on the rise, there is an increasing need to develop safer and more dependable obesity treatment options. TCM's synergistic effect of herbs and a holistic therapeutic approach may have bene\u0000ts in treating obesity, and it may be worthwhile to explore and use TCM as a treatment option. Our study has revealed the core herb combination of Coptis chinensis, Epimedium grandi\u0000orum, Salvia miltiorrhiza, and Poria cocos as potential herbs in the treatment of obesity through association analysis. Hierarchical clustering has also shown patterns of herb classi\u0000cation through therapeutic effect and meridian entry. Nonetheless, the identi\u0000ed core herb combination warrants further research to determine its MOA and long-term clinical e\u0000cacy before future clinical use.
