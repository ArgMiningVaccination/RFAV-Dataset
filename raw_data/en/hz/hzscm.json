Acupuncture is the practice of inserting very thin filaments through a person's skin at specific points to various depths, depending upon the ailment being treated. There are approximately 350 acupuncture points where a skilled acupuncturist can stimulate the body's muscles, connective tissues, and energy flow to treat ailments such as back, neck, and knee pain, arthritis, sciatica, high blood pressure and fibromyalgia to name a few. It can also be used to induce labor and assist in the treatment of infertility. At AOH our Healers are highly skilled and experienced acupuncturist that understand the right combination of acupuncture access points needed to treat your health challenge. Your initial 90 minute consultation with an AOH Healer will lead to an individualized treatment plan, purposefully designed to bring You back to You again. Health is the result of a harmonious balance of the body's energy flow known as Qi (pronounced \"Chee\"), and illnesses are generally the result of an imbalance. The body's energy flow runs in regular patterns through the body and over its surface in a series of channels. These channels, called meridians, are like rivers flowing through the body to irrigate and nourish the muscles and body tissues. Acupuncture seeks to remove any blockages of the meridians and re-establish healthy energy flow. A skilled acupuncturist knows how to insert a series of thin filaments in the body's muscles and connective tissues to allow for a proper and balanced meridian flow. A skilled acupuncturist also knows the right combinations of the 350 acupuncture points to access in order to address a particular ailment. Acupuncture & Stress Stress is a natural nonspecific response of the body to the various demands we place upon it. However, stress is not necessarily negative. There is a distinction between healthy and unhealthy stress. Healthy stress includes appropriate physical exercise, good eating habits, positive thinking, adequate rest, and a natural response to emergency situations. These stressors keep us alert and motivated and support our body's straight and vitality. Unhealthy stress, such as negative emotions and thinking, overexertion, poor eating habits, lack of sleep and chemicals and environmental pollutants and toxins, challenge our health and can trigger physical and mental problems, particularly if they are experienced over a prolonged period of time. In ancient times, our stress response, also known as our fight or flight response, provided us with the energy to preserve life during difficulty situations, such as an attack or threat by a wild animal. Today, we don't have to look much further than our windows or computer screens to view various forms of stressors, everything from prime-time news and road rage to the 40-hour workweek, news, terrorism talk, and cell phones. All of these combine to send even the most serene people into a stressful frenzy state. Unfortunately, modem day stress is considerably higher, more frequent, and more consistent than what our predecessors experienced. Over time this excess stress can actually be detrimental to our health. Our body's natural response to stressful situations is to motivate all available resources for survival and to get us out of a scary situation fast. However, with the increase in physical emotional and mental stressors, our stress response gets \"locked-in\", resulting in the deletion of the body's resources. Even if the stressors are no longer present, the body continues to keep the stress response active. This results in the depletion of our nervous system, lymphatic organs (spleen, thymus, and lymph nodes), kidneys, and adrenal glands, and can pave the way for a wide variety of negative outcomes. Medical studies have shown that with increased and consistent stress our white blood cells, which protect our body against viruses, decrease. This decrease results in lower immune resistance, ultimately leading to physical disease and emotional instability. There is hope, however. Acupuncturists have been helping people cope with stress for over 25 years. A competent acupuncturist understands your stress level and how stress affects the body organs, but an expert acupuncturist is understood your body's Qi, the energy or power that animates and supports the functions of the body. One way that stress affects the body is by causing the depletion or blockage of Qi, especially that of the kidneys and adrenals. Qi flows through specific pathways, called meridians, and provides nourishment for the entire body. When Qi becomes blocked or the supply is inadequate, the body and organ systems become \"stressed out\" and our health is then compromised. With acupuncture and herbology, the healer's job is to support and restore the integrity of the various organs affected and depleted by the stress response, along with evaluating the quality and quantity of Qi. Skilled acupuncturists often suggest adjunct therapies to enhance treatment and speed healing. Eating properly, ingesting prescribed herbs, exercising, stretching, meditating, support, and promote a balanced and healthy body, mind, and spirit. Acupuncture also has a secondary effect, one that treats pain. Research has shown that because acupuncture stimulates points involving muscles and connective tissue, it also triggers the body's own natural production of painkillers such as endorphins. When the body releases its own endorphins, they work by binding with opioid receptors, effectively blocking pain in a natural non-addictive way. For that reason, acupuncture is a healthy alternative to address pain for a person in opioid addiction recovery or for those who want to avoid the negative side effects of painkiller medicine. Initial consultation and evaluation from a skilled acupuncturist generally takes 60 to 90 minutes which leads to an individualized treatment plan. A common treatment plan for a single complaint would typically involve one or two treatments a week. The actual number of recommended acupuncture treatments will depend upon the ailment being treated and its severity. Most ailments call for six to eight treatments.
