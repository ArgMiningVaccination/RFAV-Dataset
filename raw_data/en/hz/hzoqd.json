Mr. B URTON . Good afternoon. A quorum being present, the Com- mittee on Government Reform will come to order. I ask unanimous consent that all Members ' and witnesses ' writ- ten and opening statements be put in the record. Without objection,so ordered. I ask unanimous consent that all articles, exhibits, and extra- neous and tabular material referred to be included in the record.Without objection, so ordered. Today we are here to talk about the autism epidemic. I use the word ''epidemic '' for a good reason. Typically, we think about epidemics in terms of infectious diseases. However, a condition isconsidered epidemic when it occurs suddenly in numbers that areclearly higher than normal. Ten years ago only 1 in 10,000 children were thought to be autis- tic. When we began our investigation in 1999, that number was es-timated to be 1 in 500. That is a 20 times increase. However, thenumber today appears to be even higher. The Center for Disease Control [CDC], conducted two prevalence studies. The study in Brick Township, NJ, found that 1 in 181 chil-dren between the ages of 3 and 10 were diagnosed with autism,and 1 in 128 were diagnosed with autism spectrum disorders. An VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:56 Jul unpublished study conducted in 1996 in Atlanta, GA, found that 1 in 294 children ages 3 to 10 had autism. The National Institutes of Health [NIH], places the estimate at 1 in 250 children, and boys are affected four times more often thangirls. That means that about 1 in every 156 boys in this countrybetween the ages of 1 and 10 are autistic. Unfortunately, the unexpectedly high rates in Georgia and New Jersey are not isolated examples. This school year there are 3,789individuals with autism in Indiana schools. This is up from 116just 12 years ago, 116 to 3,789. A recent news article out of Thailand indicates that there are 100,000 children in Thailand with autism. In 1999, the East SurreyHealth Authority in the United Kingdom stated that the preva-lence of autism in their district was 1 in every 69 boys. In the 60 years since autism was first described, we have not yet figured out what causes it. We do not know if classical autism andlate-onset autism are the same conditions or two different condi-tions with similar symptoms. We have come a long way in 60years. Doctors no longer blame the condition on bad mothering. Butwe have a lot more work to do before we can pat ourselves on theback for our accomplishments. Is our investment in research on autism on a comparable level with other epidemics? This is very interesting. Are the CDC andNIH funding studies that will help prevent or cure autism? Is theirresearch adequately addressing the medical issues associated withautism such as food allergies, chemical sensitivities, and autisticenterocolitis? Is the information about autism provided by our gov-ernment adequate and useful to families? The CDC will testify today that they plan on spending $11.3 mil- lion on autism this year and $10.2 million on autism next year. Wecompared that to two other conditions that have been declaredepidemics: diabetes and AIDS. Both of these conditions can be dev-astating. Both deserve sufficient research dollars to develop treat-ments and look for cures. The CDC is spending over $932 million on the AIDS epidemic this fiscal year. Compare that to $11 million for autism. AIDS de-serves attention \u2014don't get me wrong \u2014and so does diabetes, which both Secretary Thompson and the former Surgeon General declaredan epidemic. CDC this year will spend just over $62 million on dia-betes. The autism epidemic, just like the diabetes and AIDSepidemics, is no less deserving. Yet, the CDC 's spending for autism is almost 80 times less than that for AIDS. And CDC 's spending for autism is five times less than that of diabetes. CDC should becommitting more research money for autism, and we are going towork on that. Now let 's look at the National Institutes of Health. We have got some charts up there on the wall which you can look at. The NIHis the premier biomedical research institution in the world. Con-gress has worked hard to double the NIH 's budget. Their total budget this year is $27 billion. We are committed to funding re-search to help cure crippling diseases. The NIH will testify today that their commitment to researching autism has grown dramatically in the last few years. In fiscal year1997, the NIH investment in autism research was only $22 million. VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:56 had grown to $56 million, in large part be- cause of the Congress. That 's good, but let 's put that into perspective. At the same time the NIH is spending $56 million on autism, a condition that affects1 in every 250 children in this country, they are investing over $2.2billion in AIDS research. The rates of diabetes increased by 49 per-cent between 1990 and the year 2000. Diabetes is a devastatingcondition in the Native American community and of increasing con-cern in the African American and pediatric populations. This yearthe NIH investment for diabetes is $688 million, and compare thatto the $56 million that they are going to spend on autism, and com-pare that to the huge money that is being spent on the AIDS re-search. I believe these numbers speak for themselves. Funding in basic and clinical research into autism needs to be expanded dramati-cally. We have an epidemic on our hands, and we in Congress needto make sure that the NIH and CDC treat this condition like anepidemic and put their efforts into doing several things: First, tofind out the causes of the epidemic. Second, determine how to stopthe epidemic in its tracks. Third, to evaluate treatment options.And, fourth, to look for a cure. When we first began looking at this issue, we heard from thou- sands of families. Many told us their children were absolutely nor-mal until they were vaccinated, and that just a few days or weeksafter they became vaccinated they became autistic. We also heardabout a dramatic similarity in these late-onset autism cases. Manyof these children have unusually high levels of heavy metals intheir systems. They have immune system irregularities. They haveunresolved yeast infections. Eating foods that contain wheat ordairy may result in a rapid deterioration of behavior. Exposure tomany chemicals, even perfumes, can have the same adverse effect.Many have chronic diarrhea. NIH and CDC need to fund researchto get answers to all these issues. One of the things that concerns me is that it seems that many of these children, if we tested hair samples, urine samples, bloodsamples, could give us an idea of whether or not they have mercuryin their systems, and to what degree, and whether or not there areother toxic chemicals that may be in their systems that could befound through these tests. Autism has personally affected my family, and many of you al- ready know that. My grandson Christian was normal and healthyuntil his second year of life. He walked, he talked, he made eyecontact, he enjoyed going to the mall, and all the other things that2-year-olds do. And then suddenly, shortly after receiving his man-dated immunizations, he became a different child. He no longerspoke. He would not look anyone in the eye. He cried endlessly. Hebanged his head against the wall. He began running around flap-ping his hands, and he had chronic diarrhea and severe bowelproblems. We now know that he was suffering from an adverse re- action to his vaccines. We also know that he may have receivedmore mercury in his vaccines than is considered safe, way morethan safe, by Federal standards. This mercury toxicity was contrib-uting to the adverse reaction. VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:56 the NIH and the CDC discount any potential connection. The Institute of Medicine has stated that the available researchdata is insufficient to prove or disprove a connection between au-tism and either the MMR vaccine or thimerosal, which is the pre-servative put in most children 's vaccines. But they say the link is biologically plausible. The IOM called for more research in thisarea. One of the reasons we are here today is to make sure thatresearch gets done, and gets done now rather than 10 years fromnow, when many more thousands of children become autistic. When you are a parent, whether your son or daughter is autistic from birth, because of genetics, or because of some environmentalexposure such as vaccines or maybe something else, you are facinga challenge more difficult than a 500-piece puzzle. You are facedwith putting the puzzle of your child 's life together one piece at a time. Do you put special locks on your doors and windows and add an alarm system because you 're afraid the child will wander away from your home? Do you need to put a lock on a cabinet in yourkitchen to keep the foods that set your children into a spiral outof their reach? What medicines or dietary supplements will yourchild need? How do you find services? Does your child need to learnsign language? Do you need ABA or other behavioral therapy?Where can you find a qualified speech therapist? How are yougoing to pay for all of this? How are you going to get through theschool services maze? How will you find time for your other chil-dren? What happens when the child grows up? And that 's something our government needs to think about. One in 250 children are be-coming autistic, and we are not doing a great deal of dealing withthat problem right now, but they are going to grow up and thenthey are going to be adults with autism. Now if you have 1 in 250people in this society that 's autistic down the road, because we haven 't done our job now, how are we going to take care of it? How are we going to take care of all the health care needs besides au-tism at the same time as taking care of the burden they are goingto be on society? And our medical and research people need to ad-dress that issue. These are all dilemmas that parents face now. In addition to witnesses from the NIMH and CDC, I am pleased that we have several autism organizations represented here today.We were not able to have all of the organizations testify at thetable, but I hope that each will submit written statements for therecord. Mr. Lee Grossman of Hawaii is our first witness. He is the presi- dent of the Autism Society of America and has a son with autism. Ms. Belinda Lerner of New York is a member of the Autism Coa- lition and has a son with autism. While having a child with autismmay be her toughest battle, Ms. Lerner is not a stranger to toughbattles; she is the first female attorney to work for the NationalFootball League. Those are big guys. [Laughter.] Mr. Stephen Shore of Brookline, MA, is a board member of Unlocking Autism. Mr. Shore, who did not speak the first 4 yearsof his life, has Asperger 's disease, a condition on the autism spec- trum. Mr. Shore is a success story. Because of his mother 's drive and dedication, Mr. Shore is a doctoral candidate at Boston Univer- VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:56 very commendable. He gives all families with autistic children hope. Mr. Doug Compton is the science program director of Cure Au- tism Now and the father of an autistic child. I look forward to hearing from our witnesses today. Our hearing record will remain open until May 3rd. [The prepared statement of Hon. Dan Burton follows:] VerDate 11-MAY-2000 Waxman is not yet here. Mr. Gilman, do you have a statement you would like to make?Mr. G ILMAN . I do. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I want to thank Chairman Burton for conducting this important hearing regardingNIH and CDC 's response to the rising rate of autism in our Nation. I recently met in my constituency with Jeanine Conklin, a moth- er to Daniel, her 5-year-old autistic son. Listening to her explainthe obstacles that her family must face each and every day re-affirmed by commitment to this issue. It is essential that there becontinued research of and funding for learning more about how thisaffliction manifests itself and how it can be prevented, and how toproperly educate the public. It is important to understand how wedefine autism, why the autism rate is increasing, and how we cansupport effective research that will benefit those who are alreadyafflicted by autism. Autism makes it difficult for an individual to interact with people and their environment. In some cases those with the illness maybehave in an aggressive or self-injurious manner. It occurs in peo-ple of all races, ethnicities, and socioeconomic backgrounds. A bet-ter understanding of the origins of the disease is crucial to intro-ducing new and effective treatments. As Chairman Burton noted, autism has afflicted 1 in 500 chil- dren in the United States. However, the CDC shows that evenhigher rates occur in some specific locales such as Atlanta, GA,Brick Township, NJ, where the autism rates are 1 in 94 and 1 in128, respectively. These alarmingly high rates have lead to several inquiries into the contributing factor of the disease, including, but not limited to,childhood vaccines and some of the environmental factors. Many ofthe symptoms of autism are the same as mercury toxicity. Throughan FDA review, it was learned that the amount of mercury in man-dated vaccines that children were receiving in the first 6 monthsof their lives exceeded guidelines that were established by the En-vironmental Protection Agency and validated through an Instituteof Medicine review. We have convened here today to monitor whether NIH and the CDC have satisfactorily responded to the challenge of autism re-search. More specifically, we would like to know if they made head-way into IOM 's research recommendations, research to determine how children metabolize and excrete metals, particularly mercury;continued research on theoretical modeling of ethyl-mercury expo-sures and careful, rigorous, and scientific evaluations of chelation,when used in children with neurodevelopmental disorders, espe-cially autism. Our committee 's oversight is an essential component to increas- ing communication. Autism is a disease that paralyzes communica-tion. We cannot afford to paralyze the communication between ourmedical community, our government sector, and those families whohave been affected by autism. We owe it to the American familieslike the Conklins in my area to do everything in our power to en-sure that the Federal Government continues its commitment to au-tism, to research and discovery. As a member of our Congressional Caucus on Autism, I am ex- tremely interested in the testimony that our witnesses will have to VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:56 Jul us today. I want to thank Chairman Burton again for his dedication to the health and safety of our Nation 's children. Mr. B URTON . Thank you, Mr. Gilman. Let's see, Dr. Weldon. Dr. W ELDON . Hi, Mr. Chairman. I do not have an opening state- ment, but I just want to again thank you for bringing the spotlightof congressional scrutiny onto this very critical issue of autism inAmerica. I believe it to be a forgotten and neglected disease for toolong. Thank you for your leadership on this. Mr. B URTON . Thank you, Dr. Weldon. Mr. Shays. Mr. S HAYS . Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Chairman, no pre- pared statement other than to thank you for having this hearingand to say that, like a number of Members of Congress, I have avery sizable number of autistic young and old in my district. It isfar more noticeable than in the past, and I am deeply concernedabout it. I can 't imagine what it must be like for a parent to hold a child and just be hungry for some type of response of recognition.So I just thank you. I know we are all wrestling with this. I know nobody has the an- swers, but together I hope we are able to find some. Mr. B URTON . Thank you, Mr. Shays. Ms. Davis. Mr. Horn. Mr. H ORN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for this continuing effort to get at autism. I would like to have in the record a piece called''Medicine for the Love of Zachary, '' which was Zach and Karen London, and she affected 400,000 people nationwide with her cru-sade. I think you would find it very inspiring. Mr. B URTON . Thank you, Mr. Horn. We will put that in the record, without objection. [The information referred to follows:] VerDate 11-MAY-2000 the minority members going to be here? [No response.]Mr. B URTON . We will now ask the first panel to come forward. Mr. Grossman, Ms. Lerner, Mr. Shore, and Mr. Compton, wouldyou please approach the witness table and stand up so we canswear you in? [Witnesses sworn.]Mr. B URTON . Be seated. We will start with you, Mr. Grossman. I guess we will just go right down the line. Do you have an opening statement? STATEMENTS OF LEE GROSSMAN, PRESIDENT, AUTISM SOCI- ETY OF AMERICA, AND AN AUTISM PARENT, HONOLULU, HI;BELINDA LERNER, MEMBER, AUTISM COALITION, AND AN AUTISM PARENT, NEW YORK, NY; STEPHEN SHORE, BOARDMEMBER, UNLOCKING AUTISM, BROOKLINE, MA; AND DOUGCOMPTON, SCIENTIFIC DIRECTOR, CURE AUTISM NOWFOUNDATION, NEW JERSEY Mr. G ROSSMAN . Yes, I do, Mr. Chairman. Mr. B URTON . If we could, we would like to try to keep our open- ing statements to 5 minutes, if we can, so we can get through ev-erybody and have time for questions. Mr. G ROSSMAN . Good afternoon. My name is Lee Grossman and I am president of the Autism Society of America, chair of the Au-tism Society of America Foundation, a member of the Federal Gov-ernment 's Interagency Autism Coordinating Committee, a resident of Honolulu, HI, a small business owner for over 20 years in themedical industry, and, most importantly, a father of a child withautism whose name is Vance. Mr. Chairman, I would like to thank you and your colleagues on the Committee on Government Reform for this opportunity topresent testimony on the issue of autism, the fastest-growing dis-ability in our country today. As President of the Autism Society ofAmerica, I can tell you that hearings such as this offer hope tohundreds of thousands of individuals and families affected by au-tism. I am going to deviate from my testimony a little bit to respond to your opening statements. They 're very moving to me in that it truly represents what all of the families are going through, our ex-periences, our frustrations in dealing with this dilemma that we 're faced with. I want to thank you very much for acknowledging for the first time, that I am aware of, that the Federal Government is now ac-knowledging in this country that autism is an emergency, and itis a national health crisis. It is something that has not evaded theadvocates and the families to this point. It is reassuring to all ofus to know that the government is finally recognizing this as anepidemic. There are a number of factors and figures that I would like to present here before I get into what I believe that we need to do andwhat ASA believes that we should do to correct this problem overthe near short-term. Currently, it is easy to say that this is a na-tional health crisis. There are as few as a half million to perhaps1.5 million people with autism in the United States today. Esti- VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:56 as high as for every 1,000 children that are born today 6 will have autism. The annual cost of treating autism in the United States is any- where from $20 billion to $60 billion every year. Autism is growingat a rate of 10 to 17 percent each year. Based on these figures, in10 years the annual costs associated with autism could be as muchas $50 to $300 billion per year. After 60 years of dealing with thisproblem, the Federal Government is currently spending $75 millionon research when the problem is in actuality conservatively a $20billion problem. After 60 years of this approach, we have no identi-fied causes of autism or any proven treatments or therapies. Some-thing substantially greater has to be done to address this nationalemergency, and we have to spend substantially more money to findcauses and effective treatments. The Autism Society of America believes there are four critical areas that need to be addressed, and these four areas are in autismresearch, early identification intervention, secondary school edu-cation, and adult issues. Here are our immediate recommendations. Current funding levels in biomedical research at NIH are terribly low in relation to the disorders population and economic impact.We are recommending that the Federal Government increase thefunding available for research over the next 3 years to a level of$500 million per year devoted to basic science, environmentalscience, tissue and genetic collection, and all aspects of biomedicalresearch related to autism. When compared to the annual growingrate of autism in our Nation, this is substantially below the fund-ing to keep pace with the projected growth. In the area of applied science, we must find new and innovative ways to develop and implement therapeutic and clinic interventionsand effective treatments. There has been to date virtually no activ-ity and support from Federal agencies in these vital areas. We rec-ommend that applied research funding be increased over the next5 years to a level of $100 million per year. This increase is neededin the case of autism because we are building from a zero base. ASA also recommends that there is a need to increase the num- ber of scientists involved with research and treatment grants. Werequest that NIH develop programs and encourage researchers toenter into fields associated with autism research and to stimulatenew research protocols. The CDC surveillance programs need to be implemented and then expanded immediately so that more exact figures on the prev-alence and population of those with autism are established. In ourdiscussions with CDC, we recognize that data from a substantialnumber of State or other geographic areas will be needed to betteridentify those who have autism and what scope of services will beneeded. We, therefore, recommend that the CDC budget in thisarea be increased to $8 million to expand the number of regionalcenters and State surveillance programs from 9 States to 20 States.These 20 States should represent a statistically significant database to allow CDC to better identify those who have autism, andthen start looking for root causes and trends. As we must find the causes and best treatments for those with autism, there is also a need to fund areas which could identify pos-sible causes of autism created by our society. A substantial number VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:56 our autism community believe some forms of au- tism may be caused by some use of vaccines. While we do not knowthis to be specifically proved at this time, we should not ignore thebody of evidence that calls into question the source of many chil-dren with autism. If causation is found, those injured must be pro-vided recourse and compensation. This is why ASA supports and asks for early adoption by Con- gress of the Burton-Waxman bill, H.R. 3741, which improves theNational Vaccine Injury Compensation Program by extending thestatute of limitations for individuals to file claims and provides a2-year look-back provision for the families that are presently pre-vented from filing under the program, through no fault of theirown. Now under early diagnosis and early intervention, ASA strongly supports the general consensus that the most effective means fora successful result in the life of an individual with autism isthrough early diagnosis and early intense and appropriate inter-vention. Therefore, we recommend that a national awareness cam-paign be established through the U.S. Department of Health andHuman Services, national physician organizations, and communityhealth centers to provide education and identification programs topediatricians, child care providers, and to the population at large. ASA has expressed its willingness to act in concert with the De- partment to make this happen by drawing upon its unique mem-bership and chapter base with the entire autism community. ASAalso seeks increased funds for States to Early Head Start, or zeroto 3, programs administered by the Administration for Childrenand Families to provide. For education for children with autism, ASA recommends to the committee that it supports and develops legislation to implementthe recommendations and plans detailed in the National ResearchCouncil 's report, ''Educating Children with Autism. '' This report precisely addresses the education interventional needs of secondaryschool age children with autism. ASA further recommends that Congress immediately reauthorize the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act and fulfills the longoverdue commitment to the full funding of IDEA, and, last, supportservices for adults with autism. The current availability of services,support, employment, and residential options available to adultswith autism can only be described as almost non-existent. For toolong the service supports for these people has dramatically droppedonce the person passes through the secondary education system. Acomprehensive program must be developed and implemented to ad-dress the tremendous needs of this growing and immense popu-lation. ASA has developed a white paper on this subject and has posted it on our Web site to help develop interest in having it imple-mented. We have also joined with coalitions and formed coalitionsof adult service providers, and are now doing assessments of theneeds of the adults with autism community to formulate initiativesand legislation to address this problem. We ask the Congress andthis committee to join in supporting the development of legislationand funding that will be necessary to deal with this current andever-growing dilemma. VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:56 Mr. Chairman, I would be terribly remiss if I did not address the relevance and significance of this hearing. As I stated,this is the first time that I am aware of that the U.S. Governmenthas acknowledged the autism epidemic and attendant nationalhealth crisis. And with your acknowledgment, ASA stands firm andardent in requesting that this Nation take real and measurable ac-tions today to stop this national economic, social, and health emer-gency. I have described in my testimony what needs to be done now in terms of money and autism. However, there is something just asimportant to be added; that is hope. The autism community has en-dured 60 years of unfulfilled hope. Congressman Burton, I know you have waited with hope for your grandson over the last 5 years. I have waited and hoped for thelast 14 years, and the community has waited 60 years. If we willtake the actions I have offered to you today, all of our hopes canbe translated into fulfillment. Please let us help each other givemeaningful hope to the millions of people affected by autism. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and I will stand ready to answer any questions you may have. [The prepared statement of Mr. Grossman follows:] VerDate 11-MAY-2000 Thank you for that statement, Mr. Grossman. Your recommendations, along with the others that we will hear today,will be given to the officials at NIH and CDC and the FDA. Wehave some of them here who are going to be testifying in a littlebit, and they are, I am sure, taking all this in. Ms. Lerner.Ms. L ERNER . Thank you, Chairman Burton and distinguished members of the committee. I am here to speak to you today about my personal experiences with the heartbreak and frustrations of autism. By way of history,you should know, and as Chairman Burton has already said, thatprofessionally I am an attorney with the National Football League.My job has presented me with many interesting challenges, includ-ing cross examining 6-foot 5-inch, 300-plus pound professional foot-ball players. I was the first female attorney hired in that role, andso my challenges were not limited to my interactions with footballplayers, but in winning the confidence and respect of my male col-leagues in the league and at the NFL clubs. However, those chal-lenges, while daunting at the time, pale in comparison to the chal-lenges I have faced, and continue to face, as a mother of an autisticson. My son, Benjamin, was diagnosed when he was 2 years old, and when I received the news, I was relieved \u2014yes, relieved. Prior to his diagnosis, I was the mother of a screaming, inconsolable, non-com-municative little boy, who seemed to reject all my attempts to lovehim and was incapable of demonstrating his love for me. At a timewhen I should have been awash in feelings of love, I was over-whelmed by feelings of inadequacy, failure, and shame. Now the enemy that had overtaken my son had a name \u2014au- tism\u2014and like any lawyer worth her salt, I was going to defeat my adversary by researching and understanding its characteristics. Iremember bombarding the psychologist, who had diagnosed Ben,with questions: What causes autism? No one knows. How prevalentis it? Undetermined, last count, 1 in 500. What treatments aremost effective? It is unclear. There have been no reliable studies.Most importantly, what are my son 's chances for a normal life? Hard to say, but not particularly good. I refused to be cowed, but little did I know at the time the jour- ney I was embarking on. I was able to secure a spot for Ben in awonderful school dedicated to children with developmental dis-orders, where by the age of 3 he began to master basic languageand other life skills. Finally, the wonderful, charming little boy hid-den beneath the disorder began to emerge, and so did this incred-ible bond between Ben and me. Although Ben was making progress, he, nonetheless, still had substantial and pervasive deficits. And so each time a new problemarose that required additional therapy, we needed to get permis-sion from the school district 's Committee on Pre-School Education to amend his individual education plan [IEP], to address this prob- lem. Although I had my share of battles with the CPSE to get ap-propriate services for Ben, it wasn 't until Ben turned 5 and was transitioned from the CPSE to the CSE, Committee on SpecialEducation, that the hostilities elevated to an all-out war. VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:56 point Ben was to graduate from his special education school. So my husband and I evaluated the school district 's inclu- sion kindergarten program, and we both agreed that the curricu-lum and behavioral requirements were far too advanced for Ben atthat time. However, the school district refused to provide us withany alternatives. So even though the law requires that a ''free and appropriate education in the least restrictive environment '' be pro- vided to each child, we were left with the choice of putting him inthe school district 's program or pay out of pocket for any alter- native. We knew that following the district 's mandate would be setting Ben up for failure, in our experience a sure-fire recipe for disasterand regression. If we sued the school district, it would cost us asmuch as a year 's tuition. So we bit the bullet and sent Ben to a private pre-kindergarten program at our expense. This private school was initially a godsend for us, and Ben con- tinued to make small, but steady progress. But as Ben went frompre-K to the typical kindergarten program, it was clear that his de-velopmental problems were too severe to be handled by a well-in-tentioned but untrained and underequipped staff. Because the school district would not provide additional support for Ben at his private school, his failure to get the appropriateinterventions resulted in his lashing out and shutting down. Onceagain, the shadow of autism was eclipsing my sweet, charming lit-tle boy who had been showing so much promise. My husband and I pulled Ben from the private school, obtained additional therapy and additional evaluations at our own expense,and put him in our only other alternative, the school district 's kin- dergarten program, which we had rejected 2 years earlier. Ben isno longer regressing, but he is still significantly delayed in all de-velopmental categories. Our most recent round of evaluations have revealed that, unless Ben receives intensive interventions this summer to make up forthe losses he experienced this school year, he has absolutely nochance of surviving first grade. However, because the CSE has re-fused to classify Ben as a child who needs year-round services, thejob of securing the right therapists, as well as the financial burdenof providing them, will fall to us. Based on my unwavering love for my little boy, I am determined to do what is in his best interest so that he may have a chance fora happy, independent life. However, I and similarly situated par-ents are faced with many obstacles, and it is time for the FederalGovernment to share the burden and the shame that has doggedthe parents of the autistic, and the lack of government assistancein autism to date is shameful. It is shameful that this country, thegreatest nation in the world, has conducted no concerted nation-wide prevalence study. Funding Centers of Excellence, pursuant to the Children 's Health Care Act, would give us a vehicle to conduct a proper nationwide tracking program. It is shameful that there has not been signifi-cant funding into biomedical research. Less than two generationsago, the disorder was thought to be a mental illness caused by coldand detached mothers. Although we now know it is a neurological VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:56 Jul have yet to determine what causes the autism and how it impairs the brain 's functioning. It is shameful that this country has not conducted meaningful and concerted applied research to determine what therapies aremost effective in countering the horrific effects of autism. Ourschools have been besieged by this growing population, and whilerequired by law to educate and treat the autistic, they lack fundingand training to handle this enormous responsibility. Fully fundingthe IDEA statute would alleviate some of that burden. Finally, it is shameful that our Nation, either through willful ig- norance or benign neglect, has allowed this insidious and pervasivehealth care crisis to rise to epidemic proportions. I began my testimony by presenting to you the challenges I have faced professionally and personally as a mother of an autistic son,and I would like to conclude by asking that you adopt these chal-lenges and support the funding for the five Centers of Excellenceand IDEA. Past generations were damned to institutionalization.Let's not condemn our present and future generations to the same fate. I speak on behalf of the exhausted, voiceless, and desperate par- ents of autistic children, the children that without the proper gov-ernment intervention will become adults doomed to be a financialburden rather than a contributing member of society. So pleasegive full force and effect to the Children 's Healthcare Act and the IDEA statute. Thank you. [The prepared statement of Ms. Lerner follows:] VerDate 11-MAY-2000 Thank you for that statement. I would urge all of you who are interested and who are leaders in the autistic commu-nity to write your Congressmen and to write the White House andto tell them that you want these changes made and that there beappropriate funding for all of these research programs that youtalked about, because the squeaky wheel in this town gets the oil. You talk about the AIDS research, and I am taking a little lib- erty here, so forgive me. The AIDS research moneys that are beingspent are huge. I don 't fault them for giving that money to AIDS research. I think it is important. But autism is equally important.Because they have been very outspoken in the AIDS community,they have gotten a great deal of results from the health officials ofthis country, and from the Congress, and from the administrations,$700 million; I believe it was pretty close to that. If we had thatkind of money being given for autism research, we could probablyget a lot more accomplished. So write your Congressmen. Don 't write me. I am already on board. [Laughter.] But write your Congressman and write the White House and Senators and tell them that you want something done. Dr. W ELDON . Mr. Chairman. Mr. B URTON . Yes? Dr. W ELDON . Could you yield to me on this issue? Mr. B URTON . I will be glad to yield. Dr. W ELDON . Just for a minute? Mr. B URTON . Sure. Dr. W ELDON . I was going to say this in my question period. If you add up \u2014comparing to AIDS is a good thing because the preva- lence is somewhat similar. It is estimated 500,000 to a million withautism and there 's 500,000 people with AIDS, about 900,000 if you add AIDS and HIV-positive status. If you add up the money that is spent by NIH, CDC, Medicare, Medicaid, the housing money, the drug money, the Federal Govern-ment is spending $12 billion on AIDS. That is why I refer to thisas a forgotten disease. You know, Mr. Grossman, you laid out areally nice strategy. I mean it was great. I was really glad to hearyou do all that. You've got a bunch of people here that are going to be foursquare behind you, but you have got to develop a very sophisticated lobby-ing effort. You are a 600-pound gorilla that has been asleep foryears. I can tell you, if you get your act together and start workingthis town aggressively \u2014and you ought to meet with the AIDS peo- ple and just have them brief you on how they did it. I mean, weare going to double the NIH budget, and everybody is going to beout there to take a piece of it: the kidney people, the heart people,the Parkinson 's people. But they 've already got a big chunk, and the time is really ripe. I apologize for rambling on here. Mr. B URTON . No, that is all right. Dr. W ELDON . You brought it up, Mr. Chairman. Mr. B URTON . It adds to the discussion. Dr. W ELDON . It is a two-way street. You know, you 've got to work this town, and you 've got to be really slick and really sophisticated, and you 've got to put money into it, too. There are a lot of people, NFL football players, businessmen with money who will write VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:56 Jul you 've got to hire consultants. You 've got to do a whole 9 yards, but you ought to do it because I think you can cure au-tism. I really do. Mr. B URTON . Thank you, Dr. Weldon. Mr. Shore.Mr. S HORE . Chairman Burton, I thank you and your colleagues on the Committee on Government Reform for this opportunity topresent testimony, this historic opportunity to present testimony onthe issue of autism. I am Stephen Shore and reside in Brookline, MA with my wife Leawee, where I am completing a doctoral degree in special edu-cation from Boston University with an emphasis on helping thosewith autism reach their fullest potential. I am the author of ''Be- yond the Wall: Personal Experiences with Autism and Asperger 's Syndrome, '' consult internationally for autism-related issues, teach college-level courses in special education at both Boston Universityand Lesley University, as well as work with people that have au-tism. I am very fortunate to be leading a fulfilling and productivelife. Most of us here today have involuntarily been inducted into this community by the autism bug. What happens? A child is born anddevelops typically until 18 to 24 months, suddenly hit with a bombthat spreads its shrapnel from the child to the family, to education,the community, and humanity at large. The child loses verbal abil-ity; withdrawal from the environment occurs. We often see self-abusive and self-stimulatory behaviors, tantrums. I was hit with that very same bomb at age 18 months with all those wonderful characteristics that we see going with it. Despitethe claim of being too sick to work with and recommendations forinstitutionalization by diagnosing professionals, it was my parentsthat were left to provide the needed early intervention, and thiswas at a time when that term had yet to be conceived. We are talk-ing about the early mid-sixties. My parents had no support. However, fortunately, my mother was able to stay home all day and provide the equivalent of what is known today, or would beknown today, as a home-based early intervention with an emphasison music, movement, sensory integration, narration, and imita-tion\u2014to at first make me aware of her presence, and then to coax me out into her world. I was very lucky. Parents and educators, weneed to listen to the parents. They are the experts on their chil-dren. At this time I am before you as I continue my quest to help those with autism and Asperger 's disorder lead fulfilling and productive lives. I continue to struggle with the residuals of autism. While theuniform of a suit and tie that we find in government and businessmay be a mere inconvenience to most people, it is a major sensoryviolation for me. However, helping my peers on the autism spec-trum is way more important than my discomfort. I am very lucky and the rare exception of a child with an early autism spectrum diagnosis. Here in the United States of America,the wealthiest, most powerful Nation on Earth, everyone on the au-tism spectrum has a right under IDEA to receive critical servicesthroughout their lifespan tailored to their needs. This should notbe a matter of luck or debate, but it is a question of how. VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:56 Jul of my observations. As board president of the Asperger 's Association of New England, board member of the Au- tism Society of America, Unlocking Autism, and other national au-tism-related organizations, I see many others with autism spec-trum disorder who are vastly underserved: toddlers not receivingvitally needed early intervention and school age children in needof professionals educated in how to interact with those on the au-tism spectrum. We desperately need more educational research. Today we know very little about the interventions that are effective with individ-uals with high-functioning autism and Asperger 's syndrome. The implications are enormous. So many of my peers living far belowtheir potential, homelessness, other substandard living conditions,unemployment, and serious underemployment are all too common. People with high-functioning autism and Asperger 's syndrome need to be taught more how to interact successfully with the envi-ronment and people around them. Until medical terminology cananswer the questions it is pursuing, we have thousands of individ-uals who are exposed to educational interventions that are not vali-dated or, perhaps even more tragic, not exposed at all because theeducational community doesn 't know what to do. We have some literature that supports best practice for people with moderate to severe autism spectrum disorders, but the samecannot be said for individuals with high-functioning autism andAsperger 's syndrome. We need to look at the academic, cognitive, developmental, behavioral, social, sensory, and other interventions. As was mentioned before, the CDC estimates that 1 out of 250 children have autism right now. What are we going to do in 10 to15 years when they become adults? This number, 1 in 250, is actu-ally much greater if we look at the people that are affected by au-tism. What do I mean by that? We are talking about the family.One child has autism. We have other siblings. We have parents,grandparents, other relations, friends. Funds devoted to researchand early intervention now will pay huge dividends later. But what about the adults? There is very little literature on this population also. What happens in the Commonwealth of Massachu-setts where I live is we see people with high-functioning autism notbeing served by the Department of Mental Retardation becausethey have an IQ over 70; thus, they are not considered as havingretardation. The Department of Mental Health says autism is nota psychiatric disorder, so they don 't get services from the Depart- ment of Mental Health. As a result, they fall in the crack, a bigcrack, and don 't receive services at all, and similar situations exist in many other States also. What I have described, and what has been talked about by you, by Lee, by Ms. Lerner, is a national emergency. They were talkingabout up to 1.5 million individuals in the United States having au-tism, and the numbers are rising. The U.S. Department of Edu-cation, the California Department of Developmental Services, andothers, ASA, estimates autism is growing at a rate of 10 to 17 per-cent annually. We are talking about a rate of 100 to 400 percentover the next 10 years. If we look at the Mind Institute, they estimate that the conserv- ative cost of a lifetime of care, and here we are talking only trans- VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:56 Jul residential care, for every person with autism is $2 million. Multiply that by 1 million and 1.5 million,and that doesn 't even begin to express the opportunity cost of lost wages and other contributions to society such as charitable workand even playing in musical ensembles. Every one of these personsmust be given the same chance that only a select few, often dueto luck, have had to succeed in life. I would like to close with several concrete recommendations. One is let 's work with the Autism Society of America by supporting their funding request and in developing legislation regarding theautism spectrum, including implementation of the National Re-search Council 's Educating Children with Autism Report rec- ommendations. Two, immediate and abundant funding for research and edu- cation of those who work with people having autism. Three, fund fellowships to increase the number of skilled medical doctors, teachers, and other professionals in working with people inthe autism spectrum. Four, mainstream autism as it relates to insurance payments. We are dealing with a medical neurobiological condition, and nota psychiatric one, and, thus, should not be constrained by policylimits that we see on mental health coverage. Five, standardized payments for recognized methods of interven- tions across the country. It is unfair that some families are placedon long waiting lists, perhaps a year or two, to access coverage. No one particular approach can be required because different children respond to different methodologies. According to IDEA, wehave to provide the child what they need in order to get the edu-cation they need. Some sound approaches include, but are not lim-ited to, the Miller Method, Floor Time, Hagashi, Teach, and appliedbehavioral analysis. In summary, it is clear that we have some good interventions and treatments for autism in place at this time, but it is a travestythat the quantity and quality of these services are lacking. TheNIH needs to work with organizations such as the Autism Societyof America in developing national policy for people within the au-tism community, so that all those having autism have a fair shotat leading fulfilling, productive, and independent lives to the limitsof their capacities. Mr. Chairman and members of the Committee on Government Reform, your providing this historic opportunity to present testi-mony on this issue of autism today is very much appreciated. Iknow you will do the right thing. Thank you, and I am here toserve you. [The prepared statement of Mr. Shore follows:] VerDate Mr. Shore. Mr. Compton. Mr. C OMPTON . Good afternoon, Chairman Burton and members of the committee. My name is Doug Compton, and I have been anadvocate for the autism community for 6 years while I was a careerscientist studying heart disease. I have recently become the scienceprogram director for the Cure Autism Now Foundation. My son,Daniel, who is now 9 years old, has autism. I won 't restate the prevalence estimates. As we all know, they are high, and scientists are debating why these numbers arechanging, the extent to which the environmental factors are play-ing, whether diagnosis is playing a role in the rise, or whether ge-netics are playing a role in the rise with its interaction with envi-ronmental factors. What I will say is that we still do have hope. Four years ago my family and I came from New Jersey to the Capital to help introducethe Children 's Health Act. We came with enthusiasm, and it was a bright day. My son stood at a microphone such as this and re-peated his favorite script over and over, and he is still doing thatto this day. During the years between the introduction of the bill and its pas- sage, groups such as Cure Autism Now, the National Alliance forAutism Research, and the ASA formed partnerships to establish ge-netic resources, brain resources, and alliances with the NIH andother organizations studying autism. Together, we funded researchto try to identify the causes from genetics to environment. We havefunded brain imaging studies. We have funded animal models andtreatment trials. We have closed no doors, as there is still no con-clusive evidence as to what causes this thing we call autism, norare there any universally effective treatments. We continue to push the research agenda from the private sector, but we need our government to push harder. While there has beena large increase in funding from the Federal Government from $5million to $30 million a year, this is far from sufficient. It is notcommensurate with or ambitious enough to address the depth ofthe human suffering and of the economic hardship which the dis-order is placing on affected individuals. The formula by which specific funding is allocated by the NIH is a mystery to us. Far more money is spent on diseases, as you said,which affect fewer people. We understand that the NIH has to fol-low the scientific opportunity, but we ask that decisions be linkeddirectly to the real costs to society. We invest vastly more moneyin Alzheimer 's research, for example, which has a much shorter course between diagnosis and death than autism. Autism is a lifelong disorder which has no apparent inherent im- pact on longevity. Children diagnosed today with autism will be aneconomic and emotional burden to the country for the next 70years. Nearly 2 years after the passage of the Children 's Health Act, its conditions and goals are far from being met. A recent report pre-pared by the National Institute of Mental Health in February ofthis year contains what we consider to be several inaccuracies. Itreports that $56 million is spent each year on autism, and we be-lieve that these numbers are slightly exaggerated due to account-ing numbers of dollars that are spent from related activities. We VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:56 Jul to see those numbers put specifically toward direct re- search dollars that are focused on autism. We would also ask our friends at the NIH, when they put out these reports, to show us where the numbers are coming from, sothat we continue to maintain a relationship of trust and account-ability between the public and the Federal Government. We havebeen told by the NIH to anticipate the designation of two of the fiveclinical centers mandated by the act this year. Even this small steptook a lot of effort on the advocacy groups ' part. The casual atti- tude of the NIH toward autism does not reflect sufficient urgencyin our minds. While it was stated in an NIH report to Congressthat there would be an increase to $15 million per year for thesecenters, it became clear that is not going to be happening in thenear-term. We would like to request that more than two Centers of Excel- lence be designated in this cycle of funding and three to four morein the next cycle, as the law provides for a minimum of five cen-ters. Time is of the essence. We realize that scientific and medicalresearch moves forward slowly, and I know that from my own expe-rience at the bench. We could double or triple the pace if the NIHwere to designate more centers in this cycle now and then an addi-tional number in the next cycle. I know that there are qualified applicants and centers who are anxious to get started. There have been minor activities by theFederal Government in brain and gene banking, as required by theact, but we expect a larger concerted effort, as described in the leg-islation. These brain and gene repositories are vital resources to be able to understand all aspects of the disorder, including the environ-mental interactions with these factors. The advocacy groups haveinvested substantial dollars in these resources, and we expect alarger effort from the government. The NIH also needs to increase its intramural programs in au- tism. We have been trying, since the beginning at CAN, to developfield-building in which we recruit heavily at major national neuro-science meetings to try to bring people to the field of autism. Iknow that the NIH recognizes this and is supporting intramuralprograms, but we believe that it is very important that be one ofthe goals of the NIH, to develop scientists who are maybe workingin labs alongside with the NIH, who are actually working on au-tism and don 't realize that they are because this is a complex dis- order that affects many biological systems in the body, includingthe GI tract and the immune systems. The Children 's Health Act mandated that physician and public education programs be developed to allow for earlier diagnosis andintervention. It is well established that this is currently the mosteffective means of changing a child 's course on the catastrophic course and possibly creating a productive, independent person. TheDepartment of Health and Human Services has failed to movethese programs forward. In New Jersey the advocate groups came together and funded a program called First Signs, which we launched last year at the Au-tism Caucus. It has been piloted in New Jersey and seems to besuccessful in training doctors. VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:56 unacceptable that 49 States do not have a formal mandated training and education program for doctors and the public. Peopleare losing precious time. We lost lots of time with my son becauseno one knew what he had. Finally, we have heard that the CDC, also as part of the Chil- dren 's Health Act, has been prevented from fulfilling its prevalence research studies due to the Family Education Rights and PrivacyAct. They have been working with the Department of Education forover a year to allow access to the education records that hold diag-nostic information. We think that should be able to be resolved sothat the CDC can be allowed to do their job. The passage of the Children 's Health Act was an incredible first step in changing the course of this disease, and the parents wantto thank Congress for this. There is great momentum, but it willtake much more effort and money than the not-for-profit advocacygroups could ever hope to sustain. We ask Congress to continue tolead us forward and for the NIH and CDC to show leadership inautism. My son still has autism, of course, and so do hundreds of thou- sands of other Americans. They need our government agencies tobe responsive. I would like to close by thanking the members of the committee for listening to us and for acting on our requests. [The prepared statement of Mr. Compton follows:] VerDate 11-MAY-2000 Members of the committee, we are going to have a vote in about 10 minutes. So what I will do is I will yield to youright now for questions, and then I will stay here. Then I guess,Dr. Weldon, if you can come back and take the Chair, so I can rushover and vote, and then we will keep the hearing going, if that 's all right with the vice chair. So let 's start with you, Mrs. Morella. Do you have any questions? I will ask my questions while you guys are running over to vote. Mrs. M ORELLA . I was not the first to arrive here, if you want me to yield to Mr. Horn. Mr. B URTON . Let 's see, I think Dr. Weldon was the first to arrive. So we will start with Dr. Weldon then. Then we will go to you, Mr.Horn. Is that all right? Dr. W ELDON . Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Grossman, the agenda that you put together, could you just tell me a little bit about how you came to those recommendations?You had some figures in there. Did you have a committee thathelped you work on that? Mr. G ROSSMAN . These figures were actually put together in- house at ASA. We have been inundated recently by numerousmedia in the United States, as well as in Europe, to support thedata about explosion in the prevalence of autism. We were chal-lenged to find any good studies or any information out there. Wereviewed extensively all the literature that we had available. Weput it out to many people that are on our panel of professional ad-visors, other consultants that we know, professionals in the field,to provide us with information that would support the data, showsome meaning to the statistics that we feel we need to supportshowing this increase. Frankly, there is nothing out there. There are no good studies. This is all anecdotal evidence. So basing what we know on theranges that exist that are commonly being bantered about and ac-cepted, we put together a formula of approximately what it wouldtake to fund at this point the research. If you are specifically addressing the research and like the $500 million, for example, we are looking at the cost of autism, whichis, we conservatively say, $20 billion annually. That is based onwhat we figure is the prevailing \u2014the numbers, conservative num- bers, of a half million times about $40,000 per person for treat-ments per year, which is actually a low figure. Dr. W ELDON . Did you have any professionals help you put this together? Tell me a little bit about ASA. How many members doyou have and how many staff? Mr. G ROSSMAN . There 's 200 chapters throughout the United States. We have approximately 25,000 members throughout theUnited States. We have a panel of professional advisors made upof about 20 experts in the field. Our membership extends beyondthe 24,000. We don 't exclude anybody that has an interest in it. Our office here is located in Bethesda, MD. We have a staff of, Ibelieve, seven people. The committee was made up of staff and people on our board, as well as professionals that we were consulting with. We would gath-er the information, extend it out through conversations, and thencome back to put that information together. VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:56 it is, to be frank with you, a drop in the bucket compared to really what needs to be done to address this. It iswhat we felt was a conservative number to approach the govern-ment with. We feel also that much has to be done. That is why there is a 3-year ramping up of those figures, because the infrastructure ofwhat is available today in America to support autism research isnot there. It needs to be developed to get us to that point. Dr. W ELDON . I am glad you raised that point because this is one of the issues I have gotten into with the NIH. I was very pleasedthat Mr. \u2014is it ''Mr.'' or ''Dr.'' Compton \u2014Mr. Compton, he alluded to this issue, that if we were somehow able to get an appropriationthrough this year for $500 million, the NIH would be really hard-pressed to find a way to spend that much money. There are not alot of people prepared to do the research studies. I don 't recall, did you say anything in your recommendations about behavioral treatment at all? I know we need to do a lot ofbasic science treatments in terms of the pathophysiology and pre-ventions, but dealing with all of these older kids and adults, itseems to me there is really not a good body of knowledge. Some ofit seems to be emerging. Mr. G ROSSMAN . Yes, I mentioned in my testimony that virtually it is nonexistent today, the research that is going on on the thera-peutic aspect or the treatment aspect of autism, and we specificallyask for a ramping-up over the next 5 years to a level of about $100million, based specifically on the behavioral treatment, therapeutic,clinical aspects of autism. Dr. W ELDON . I am running out of time. I have one more question. Your health insurance policies cover virtually nothing, correct? Youget a diagnosis of autism. Your typical Blue Cross/Blue Shield,whatever, they will not cover any types of therapies, treatmentswhatsoever, correct? So these families are literally on their own? Itis all out of pocket? Mr. G ROSSMAN . Yes, essentially, it is all out of pocket. The only avenue that is available to us is services provided to us by the edu-cational system. It is funny that you brought this up because that is an important issue that we are grappling with on the insurance that would re-quire a full hearing on its own. Recently, California was able topass legislation mandating that developmental disabilities, andspecifically autism, be covered under the medical insurance plansin that State. Dr. W ELDON . Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. B URTON . Mr. Horn. Mr. H ORN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I have been very interested in what you had to say, and there is a few simple things I need to know. Is it Asperger 's? What is this disease? Mr. S HORE . Asperger 's syndrome. Mr. H ORN. Asperger 's. Could you tell me the difference between autism and that? I see in our lists here that, after Mr. Shore 's bit, that he is a doctoral candidate at Boston and also has Asperger 's disease, sometimes known as high-functioning autism. I would liketo just get a feel for what is that particular part of this. VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:56 Jul the major difference between autism and Asperger 's syndrome, we talked about the autism spectrum, rang- ing from severe to light. At the severe end that is what we considerthe classical canner 's autism. That is what most of society thinks of children with autism. These are the children that we see beingnonverbal, having tantrums whenever there is a change in the en-vironment, perhaps being self-abusive, a strong, you might say, orsevere lack of body-to-environmental awareness. As we move to, say, the moderate part of the spectrum, we have more environmental awareness. These children have more recep-tive language abilities. So they understand more than they canspeak. They may be considered being limited verbal, perhaps hav-ing one or two-word phrases and not very many of them. At the high-functioning end, and Asperger portion of the spec- trum, that is the lightest end of the spectrum, and we actually seemore people over there than at the severe end. These children, par-ticularly with Asperger 's syndrome, according to the DSM -4 re- vised, they don 't have any delay in communication, but the issues of socialization \u2014I should say verbal ability. There are still difficul- ties in communication. So we see major issues in communication,socialization, restricted interests, and repetitive motions. Now when we move to Asperger 's syndrome, these are the chil- dren that strictly, according to the DSM -4, have never lost their verbal ability. Applied a little bit more loosely, these are children,to need to be specific, who had have verbal ability until 18 months,the bomb hits; we lost verbal ability and we get it back. So usuallyby around the age of 4 or 5 or so, maybe 6, the verbal ability isback. It is pretty much at the level of most other people, but thelanguage is used, you might say, in a unique way and there is oftendifficulties with dealing with abstract subjects, you might say read-ing between the lines, which translates to difficulties in being ableto determine what other people 's intents are, if it is not spoken in a very concrete, clear way. The important thing to keep in mind, though, is that with both autism and Asperger 's syndrome the issues are coming from the same place. You are still dealing with the communication issues inone way or another. The most severe end, lack of verbal ability; thelighter end, Asperger end, verbal ability, but difficulties in dealingwith pragmatics or what is between the words, you might say. You still have restricted interests, special interests they are called, as Tony Oustwich talks about them, interests that are sostrong that they actually interfere with daily functioning. What thecurrent educational \u2014what people are beginning to learn in edu- cation is to use these special interests in order to facilitate learn-ing. Repetitive motions, that is often the self-stimulatory behavior that we see, and an issue that the DSM -4 doesn 't cover that I find present throughout the autism spectrum, sensory integrationissues. In that case what we are talking about is some of thesenses are turned up too high, way too high. I know people on thespectrum that if they were in a room like this, I would see theireyes vibrating like this, and they would say, ''We've got to get out of here. '' Because they actually see the cycling of the fluorescent lights above that screen there. Some senses are up too high, some VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:56 Jul low, and other senses, information that comes in from the senses is distorted or unable to use the information, you might say,in a typical manner that other people would. Mr. H ORN. Mr. Compton, is there anything you want to add to this definition? Mr. C OMPTON . No, I think that Stephen described it fairly well. Mr. H ORN. So I would be curious about what type of either bio- chemical, chemical, or whatever, to work on some of these things.Would you work with autism as well as Asperger 's approach or are there certain other ways that would call for a different type of sci-entific approach? Mr. C OMPTON . Well, I would like to address one of the aspects that Stephen brought up, which would be that, obviously, peoplewith Asperger 's who have more communication are more readily, I believe, have their symptoms remediated by behavioral teachingand interventions. In the area of I think what you are referring to as pharmacotherapy, I would say that we are in the infancy of that.I just returned from an autism clinical trial task force that ourfoundation held in Los Angeles last week, and I believe to this daythere have only been seven well-controlled, double-blind, placebo-control clinical trials in autism. Because we don 't know what the underlying neuroanatomical substrates are that are aberrant or thebiochemical pathways that are aberrant across the spectrum, it isvery difficult at this point to design targeted therapeutics for thedisease. We are still not certain how many disorders are represented under the umbrella of the autism spectrum. I would be certainfrom the data that I heard last week that certain treatments willactually give serious adverse effects to some patients, increasetheir hyperactivity and motor stereotypies, cause restlessness, de-creased sleep, whereas in another subset of patients we may seeimprovements with these types of therapies. So I would say thatit is too early in the field to generalize about any of this. When we think about treatments that go beyond the brain to the GI tract or to immune dysfunction, they we have opened up aneven wider area that we need to study. All of this reflects back onthe fact that we need to cast a wide net and we need more money,and we need more intramural programs, because despite the factthat we have made tremendous progress in the past 5 yearsthrough a lot of the advocacy groups funding research and theNIH's efforts with the CPEA programs and the newly funded re- search, we are far from having any clue as to how to develop effec-tive therapies. Mr. H ORN. Do you feel like the report to Congress is an accurate representation of what is happening in autism research? Mr. C OMPTON . Well, I would say, I was talking with Dr. Foote before this, and we don 't have a line-by-line itemization of each dol- lar that is spent, but when we look at the directed programs, whichwe are very happy that money is being spent there, we don 't see it add up to $56 million. Now that can be due to something thatas a scientist I firmly agree that we need to field-build and we needto fund research in other areas, but in the autism community I be-lieve that we need to focus on autism. When there are basic re- VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:56 Jul being addressed which could include development of brain imaging techniques or genetic techniques, or what haveyou, for those to be lumped under the category of spending on au-tism, if in fact that is being done, I 'm not certain if that is being done, but we do see an inconsistency that could be explained bythis phenomenon. That is acceptable in the sense that the intra-mural researcher, if it is being claimed as being money spent onautism, that the intramural researcher is actually doing autism re-search or at least collaborating with a researcher who is doing au-tism. I would suggest, if possible, that there be a detailed report from the Public Information Officers, so that we would feel as a commu-nity that there was an open dialog on this issue. Mr. B URTON . Mr. Horn, can we go to Mrs. Morella, and we 'll come back to you in just a moment? We are going to have a votehere, and I want to make sure she has an opportunity. Mr. H ORN. I have got to dump some stuff off for later things, so I will try to come back. Mr. B URTON . That would be fine. Mr. H ORN. OK. Mr. B URTON . Mrs. Morella. Mrs. M ORELLA . Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I think as people who are here assembled probably know, you have had a real commitment to try to unlock those secrets of au-tism. Had I thought about it earlier today, I would have worn myautism ribbon, which is puzzle pieces, you know, seeking to cometogether, but they have yet to do that. But we on this committeehave been seeking the data, wanting to know more about whatstudies are being conducted, and are rather frustrated about thefact that so much needs to be done and has not been done yet. Thatis the purpose of the meeting. So I thank you for this hearing, Mr.Chairman, and for your commitment. Mr. Grossman, you probably know that I represent Bethesda, MD, where ASA is located, very proud of the fact that is your na-tional headquarters. Mr. Shore, I am a graduate, as is my husband and a couple of my kids, of Boston University. I congratulate you on pursuing doc-toral studies, and I thank Mr. Compton and Ms. Lerner for beinghere. Also, I represent the National Institutes of Health, and I am very proud of the work that they do, and I am very proud of the factthat in the budget that we approved on the House side, and thePresident submitted, there is like a 16 percent increase for NIH,which is going to bring it to that 5-year plan of having doubled thebudget of NIH during that 5 years, by 2003. Now the question I want to ask all of you, or however time will allow, is: NIH is going to be at the table right after you. If you hada chance to ask them a question or if you had a chance to say tothem, ''How do we work together ''\u2014I mean, are they providing in- formation? Is there a partnership? Does there need to be more of VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:56 Jul know their intent is very good. So it could be that you want to say something for the record and that you would liketo ask them something or make a suggestion. I would like to start off with you, Mr. Grossman.[The prepared statement of Hon. Constance A. Morella follows:] VerDate The relationship that ASA has developed with NIH over the last year has been very, very positive. The commu-nication has been \u2014\u2014 Mrs. M ORELLA . I would add CDC, too. Mr. G ROSSMAN . Right, and the CDC has been very, very positive. There 's been much communication between us in terms of us ad- dressing our concerns with them, and them providing us answersto those issues. I am the representative on the Interagency Autism Coordinating Committee also, which is a forum which started, our first meetingwas in November, which summarizes at that first meeting all theactivities of the Federal agencies and will be an organization orcommittee going forward that, hopefully, will be coming forwardwith more suggestions. In looking at the report to Congress, for example, which de- scribes in detail what NIH and CDC is doing, it is pretty much Ibelieve they have been mandated at this point to do. What wewould need to do, and I don 't have any specific suggestions for them at this point, is that we need collectively, the autism commu-nity, as well as the legislative branch and the administration,needs to provide them with the resources that they need specifiedfor autism to expand their research efforts, to expand the servicedelivery. This incorporates a much broader base than just those two agen- cies, NIH and CDC. This is a national emergency. It has reachedepidemic proportions. It is not only a two-Federal agency issue. Itis a national issue, and we need to bring it forward as such. Mrs. M ORELLA . Would any of the other panelists like to respond to that? Yes, Mr. Compton? Mr. C OMPTON . Yes, I would like to respond. Despite the fact that I may have sounded critical about the NIH, I am absolutely thrilledwith what has been going on since my son was diagnosed. WhenI first went to my first meeting and I saw Dr. Bristol Powersspeak, I was very impressed, and I still maintain tremendous hope. I think that the NIH and its subdivisions, the NIMH and NICHD, etc., and the CDC need more money. It may sound ridicu-lous, but $56 million is not very much money when you look at thevast number of systems that are affected in autistic individuals. Beyond the medical research, at a biological level, there is a need, for instance, to develop protocols, to measure outcomes inclinical trials, and it does not just mean clinical trials of pharma-ceuticals or interventions. It means clinical trials of educationalinterventions, which need to be held to the same degree of scrutiny.A lot of families are wasting money on therapies that are not bio-logically based, which are probably also not helping their children. I would like the NIH to break down any of the barriers among the agencies and try to promote as much collaboration as possible.When it comes down to it, I think it is all about money and theprioritization and, as we talked about earlier, the way that deci-sions are made to weigh the cost of the disease to society versusthe cost of investment. I think that needs to be looked at critically,and to develop the intramural programs such that there is truefocus of related fields to this disease. It not only gets you morebang for your buck, but creates the cross-talk and the collaborative VerDate 11-MAY-2000 I think is going to be necessary to correct the sit- uation. Mr. S HORE . I have something to add. I think it is a great start. We need more. We need more work on collaborating, and I see alot of in-fighting between the autistic community. If we just lookat educational interventions, like some of the ones that I havenamed, there is no \u2014I haven 't found any study where anyone who has taken a serious look at comparative methodology. What I findin looking at the different methodologies such as the ones I havelisted, a lot of them are doing similar things, but they are callingthem different names. Also, because of such wide differences in people with autism, it is a wide spectrum. There are some children where a particularmethod works much better than another method. I would like moreresearch. Actually, that is going to be part of my doctoral disserta-tion, but that is just a start. I am just going to validate the instru-ment. What I am talking about is something that will be able to allow us to match the child to the method, because at this time it is abit like the Keystone Cops: ''Oh, this method is the greatest; that 's all there is. The other methods aren 't worth even thinking about. '' We should be kind of ashamed of that. We should all be workingtogether and corroborating. Mr. Compton 's suggestion of outcome studies, they are very, very important, longitudinal studies, hard to do, but we need them. Mrs. M ORELLA . Thank you. You have all been very helpful in re- sponding to that question. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. B URTON . Thank you, Mrs. Morella. One of the things that has concerned me has been the large inci- dence of autism being created, I believe, by things like thimerosal,which includes mercury in that preservative. In Russia, in the1980 's, they recognized problems. As a matter of fact, we just got a letter that we received this week from a professor of medicine atthe Academy of Medical-Social Management in Russia, and this let-ter details the history of concern about thimerosal in vaccines andinjury. This is a concern, as I said, that reaches back to theeighties. I would like to specifically note that Dr. Krashenyuk states, ''starting vaccination against hepatitis B of premature infants at age 2 months . . . when they reach a weight of 4 kilograms is rec-ommended in the U.S. From our point of view, this practice is un-doubtedly harmful, since it does not take elementary notions of theinfant 's immunity into account \u2014up to 1.5 years of age the infant does not have its own immune protection, and is protected only bythe mother 's passive immunity. '' And then he goes on to say, ''It is impossible today to deny the fact that this preservative, '' thimero- sal, ''can cause severe post-vaccination complications in '' [The information referred to follows:] VerDate 11-MAY-2000 That same conclusion has been reached in countries like Norway, Sweden, and Denmark has not allowed any thimero-sal in any of their vaccinations since 1990. Was there any connection when your children became vaccinated and the onset of the autism? Did you notice it in close proximity?Any of you at the table? Ms. L ERNER . Not me personally, but I can tell you that, because of the controversies surrounding the MMR, I was very concernedwhen my son had to get his second round of vaccinations. So inNew York State they allow you to get a titers test to determinewhat the immunization level is for the child and whether or not itnecessitates a second vaccination. As a result of that blood test, itshowed my son still had very high levels of the immunity in hissystem, which led me to believe that, for whatever reason, basedon his neurology, he was not able to properly metabolize the origi-nal vaccination that he got. Now Ben 's symptoms date back to, I think, infancy, but there is demonstration that obviously, based ontheir compromised neurology, that they can 't process these vaccina- tions in the same way. Mr. B URTON . In the audience, how many have noticed a change in your child after the vaccinations? [Significant show of hands.]Mr. B URTON . OK, I just wanted to know that from the audience. Mr. G ROSSMAN . Mr. Chairman, if I can comment on that? Mr. B URTON . Yes, sure. Mr. G ROSSMAN . Personally, I didn 't recognize any change in my son. We knew something was wrong, and it was about at the timethat he would have received his vaccination, but it took us a whilebefore we figured things out. It actually was my sister, who is apracticing psychologist in Philadelphia, that took a trip with himto the mainland, and she noticed that I had to get some interven-tions for him, something was terribly wrong, and she threatened totake my son away from me unless I did. But I think the stories that I have heard that many of our mem- bers tell, that many of these people in the audience will tell you,is that they believe that there is evidence that there is a directlinkage, a direct causation of vaccines causing their child 's autism. I think it is imperative for us, the advocates in the room, for ASA,and for Congress, for the lay public, to stand together to get thisquestion answered, answered immediately. We are perhaps creating generations of children that are severely getting injured through vaccinations. We don 't know that, but there is a growing body of evidence such as what you are reporting fromEurope that really draws into question what is going on. So what-ever is necessary from you to give us direction on what we needto do, we will support that. Mr. B URTON . How many members? You said you had 25,000 members in your organization? Mr. G ROSSMAN . 25,000 members, and we have an extended mem- bership of people that are signed up as advocates that actuallydon't pay a membership. Our reach, we believe, extends into cer- tainly 50,000 to 60,000 people at any one time. Mr. B URTON . Now the organization that you are connected with, Ms. Lerner, how many members do you have? Do you know? VerDate 11-MAY-2000 is hard to actually quantify that because we are an umbrella organization, and organizations like ASA, CAN, NAR,they are all part of our group. So we would be collectively whatevertheir membership \u2014\u2014 Mr. B URTON . So it would be kind of included in the same? Ms. L ERNER . Yes. Mr. B URTON . How about you, Mr. Shore? Mr. S HORE . Yes, the Asperger 's Syndrome Coalition of the United States, I believe we have a reach of probably 2,000 to 3,000 by thetime the mailing that is rebound all over the place. Mr. B URTON . OK, and your organization? Mr. C OMPTON . CAN 's membership, I am not sure if the member- ship is completely autistic, for autistic families, runs at about35,000. Mr. B URTON . Around 35,000? Well, somewhere between 60,000 and 100,000 people can be reached by your organizations, and I amsure there are other organizations here that I am familiar with. Iwould like to just restate one more time what I said earlier. Thatis that the squeaky wheel gets the oil in this town. I cited the amount of money that is being spent for the various research projects including AIDS and diabetes, and so forth, andthe comparison of that with the money that is being used for au-tism research. We are going to be funding at a much higher levelresearch at NIH in the coming years, and this is the time for youto be proactive. I cannot stress enough how important it is, and I will be doing my part here as well, and other Members will, to contact your Con-gressman, your Senators. Don 't just write to one; write to them all, if you can, in your State, and make sure and tell your members,make sure to tell them how important it is that there be an in-crease and an adequate amount of funding and the proper researchinto rehabilitation for children and prevention, to make sure thatwe find out what is causing this, not just possibly things like mer-cury in vaccines, but other things, maybe other toxic substancesthat may be in the vaccines, maybe mixing too many at one time.The immune system might not be able to handle that much. Maybeit is the MMR vaccine. I don 't know what all the circumstances are, but that research needs to be done, and it is going to cost money.It is going to take pressure to be exerted from folks like you folks. Yes, go ahead.Mr. W AXMAN . I want to join you in supporting more research be- cause there is still so much we don 't know about autism. We do not know how prevalent it is. We need to do the research in order tounderstand what the actual prevalence of autism is and whetherthe increases in cases is due to better diagnosis or to environ-mental causes that can be prevented, or some combination of fac-tors. We also don 't understand the causes of autism, nor do we have a cure. That is why Congress enacted the Children 's Health Act of 2000. This act, which I strongly supported, increased funding forautism research. But we need to do more than wait for the re-search. The National Academy of Sciences has made it very clearin a report last year that early intervention is critical for educatingand treating autistic children. It is incumbent on the medical and VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:56 Jul to identify children in need of services as early as possible, and it must be a high priority for Congress to as-sure that all children with developmental delays, including autism,have access to scientifically proven treatment and educational serv-ices that can maximize their potential. I appreciate the contribution of all the witnesses who have testi- fied at these hearings and educated us about what it is like to livewith a child with autism or to live with autism themselves. I wantyou to know that the experiences you have recounted are part ofthe record. They will be shared with our colleagues, and they aregoing to have a genuine impact. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.[The prepared statement of Hon. Henry A. Waxman follows:] VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:56 Thank you, Mr. Waxman. We do appreciate what you have done in the past to help in this area. Let me just say to this panel that we really appreciate your testi- mony. We hope you stick around to hear what the NIH people haveto say and the people from our health agencies. We are going to take a brief recess here. Dr. Weldon will start the hearing, and I will be back as soon as I get a chance to voteon the floor. We stand in recess at the fall of the gavel.[Recess.]Dr. W ELDON [assuming Chair]. Chairman Burton asked me to re- convene the hearing. So I would like to again convey his thanks to the first panel, and I would like to ask our next panel to come forward and take theirseats. The committee will now resume. On the second panel we have Dr. Steven Foote, Director, Division of Neuroscience and Basic Be-havioral Science, National Institute of Mental Health, at the Na-tional Institute of Health, and Dr. Coleen Boyle, Associate Directorof Science and Public Health, National Center on Birth Defects andDevelopmental Disabilities. And we have a third panelist, is thatright? You are going to accompany Dr. Boyle, OK. And your nameis? Ms. W HARTON . Melinda Wharton. Dr. W ELDON . OK, all please rise? [Witnesses sworn.]Dr. W ELDON . Let the record indicate that the witnesses indicated in the affirmative. I want to thank the panelists for being here. I would ask you to try your best to summarize your comments to approximately 5 min-utes, and we will begin with you, Dr. Boyle. Please proceed. STATEMENTS OF COLEEN BOYLE, ASSOCIATE DIRECTOR FOR SCIENCE AND PUBLIC HEALTH, NATIONAL CENTER ONBIRTH DEFECTS AND DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES, CEN- TERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL AND PREVENTION, U.S. DE-PARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES, ACCOM-PANIED BY MELINDA WHARTON, DIRECTOR, EPIDEMIOLOGYAND SURVEILLANCE DIVISION, NATIONAL IMMUNIZATIONPROGRAM, CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL AND PREVEN-TION; STEPHEN FOOTE, DIRECTOR, DIVISION OF NEURO-SCIENCE AND BASIC BEHAVIORAL SCIENCE, NATIONAL IN-STITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTH, NATIONAL INSTITUTES OFHEALTH, U.S. DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERV-ICES; AND ANN WILLOUGHBY, DIRECTOR, CENTER FOR RE-SEARCH FOR MOTHERS AND CHILDREN, NATIONAL INSTI-TUTE OF CHILD HEALTH AND HUMAN DEVELOPMENT Dr. B OYLE . Good afternoon, Congressman Weldon and members of the committee. I am Dr. Coleen Boyle, Associate Director forScience at the National Center on Birth Defects and DevelopmentalDisabilities at the CDC, and I am accompanied by Dr. MelindaWharton, who is the Director of the Epidemiology and SurveillanceDivision at the National Immunization Program at CDC. VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:56 Jul would like to thank you for the opportunity to update you today on CDC 's activities related to autism that have occurred dur- ing the year since your last hearing. I would also like to thank theparents, the autism advocacy groups, and Mr. Shore for sharingtheir concerns with us about autism. The committee requested that CDC testify about the problems of autism and what we know about the apparent increase in rates.We were also asked to discuss the timeline for implementation ofthe research recommendations from the IOM evaluation of the au-tism vaccine-related issues as well as CDC 's funding for autism re- search. We are prepared to discuss these issues. The committee also requested that we address research efforts conducted by the CDC into treatments for autism spectrum dis-order. CDC has not conducted research into the treatment of au-tism spectrum disorders since the NIH is the agency responsiblefor such clinical research. Last year I told you about the report of a prevalence study that has already been mentioned today in Brick Township, NJ. That in-vestigation found rates of 6.7 and 4.0 per thousand children for au-tism spectrum disorder and for autistic disorder, respectively. This year we can report on the prevalence of autism spectrum disorder in the metropolitan Atlanta Disabilities Program. This re-port shows a prevalence of autism spectrum disorder of 3.4 perthousand children, as you have already heard. We believe this tobe a minimum prevalence and that most of the cases that we haveincluded are actually autistic disorder. In general, the Atlanta rateis similar to that which we found in Brick Township. We cannotdetermine whether the rates are increasing or not because we don 't have comparable data from earlier years, but we will continue tomonitor the current rate closely. We can also not yet generalize for a prevalence for the U.S. popu- lation. The population in Brick Township was very small, about9,000 children, and the population monitored in metropolitan At-lanta is much larger, close to 300,000 children, but we cannot as-sume that is representative of the U.S. population. Determining ifthere are regional differences in autism prevalence really requiresdata from other regions of the country. To address this need, we have implemented a State autism mon- itoring program. In fiscal year 2000 we funded five States to trackautism. In fiscal year 2001 we funded four Centers on Autism andDevelopmental Disabilities Research and Epidemiology for the pur-pose of not only collecting prevalence data, but for conducting col-laborative epidemiologic studies to try to begin to identify causesand preventable risk factors for autism. With these programs, plus the one that CDC runs in Atlanta, we have now nine States involved in monitoring the prevalence of au-tism. With the new funding that we have received in fiscal year2002, we expect to add at least three programs, bringing the totalup to 12 States that will be tracking autism prevalence. Monitoring the prevalence of developmental disabilities such as autism provides a number of challenges, including identifying prop-er sources for case information. Unlike birth defects that are moreeasily identified in the first year of life, developmental disabilities VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:56 Jul later in childhood and may require nontraditional sources for public health monitoring. Collecting data from these sources has proved challenging. CDC will continue to work with colleagues in other agencies to try to ad-dress this important issue. In 2000, CDC and NIH contracted with the Institute of Medicine to establish an independent expert committee to review thehypotheses about existing and emerging immunization safety con-cerns. Some researchers have suggested that the receipt of eitherthe MMR vaccine or thimerosal-containing vaccines has been asso-ciated with various neurodevelopmental disabilities, including au-tism. The IOM was asked to review the available information on these issues. In the March 2001 IOM report regarding the association be-tween MMR vaccine and autism spectrum disorder, the committeeconcluded that the evidence favors rejection of a causal relationshipat the population level between the MMR vaccine and ASD. In October 2001 the IOM Immunization Safety Committee pub- lished a report on the possible association between thimerosal-con-taining vaccines and neurodevelopmental disorders. In this reportthe IOM concluded that the evidence is inadequate to accept or re-ject a causal relationship between exposure to thimerosal vaccinesand the neurodevelopmental disorders of autism, ADHD, andspeech and language delay. In these reports IOM also made specific recommendations for a number of epidemiologic studies. The CDC has initiated a broadrange of studies to better assess these findings as well as to ad-dress recommendations by the IOM Immunization Safety ReviewCommittee. These studies are discussed and detailed in my writtensummary. CDC remains committed to collecting accurate data on the preva- lence of autism and to conducting studies to find its causes. Wewant every child to be born healthy and to grow and develop nor-mally, so that they are able to lead productive lives. We are dedi-cated to continuing our work to identify what causes autism andhow it can be prevented. We appreciate your attention to this problem and we look for- ward to working with you, Dr. Weldon, and other members of thecommittee. [The prepared statement of you very much, Dr. Boyle. We will now hear from Dr. Foote. You may proceed. Dr. F OOTE . Dr. Weldon, members of the committee, I am Dr. Steve Foote, Director of the National Institute of Mental Health 's Division of Neuroscience and Basic Behavioral Science. Entering oncue is Dr. Ann Willoughby, Director of the Center for Research forMothers and Children at the National Institute of Child Healthand Human Development, who is accompanying me today. The sustained attention that this committee has directed to the issue of autism research has helped to focus and accelerate our ef-forts at NIH. I appreciate the opportunity to talk with you aboutNIH support of research on autism. I am a neuroscientist who hasbeen interested in the brain and its disorders throughout my ca-reer. Like others, I have found autism to be a particularly challeng-ing mystery. My view of this disorder has been broadened and deepened re- cently by my continuing interactions with family members of chil-dren and adults with autism. I feel their urgency. An affected childcannot wait for research before growing up. Each day, each poten-tial improvement is crucial. I would like to acknowledge the important role of family and ad- vocacy groups in our efforts. They have not only raised the visi-bility of autism and challenged assumptions, they have pushed foraccelerated and expanded research activities. Today I would like to report on progress that has been made at NIH. Only a few years ago research on pervasive developmentaldisorders, the autism spectrum disorders, was fragmented and dis-tributed across NIH institutes and other agencies with little coordi-nation. Today a more integrated, but still appropriately specializedapproach is in place. The basic research on autism that is sorely needed is moving for- ward at an accelerated pace, as is continued genetic research andstudies of the etiology of various symptoms, such as communicationdisorders. I am a witness today because I play several roles in thisintegration and overall comprehensive planning. I am the InterimExecutive Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Serv-ices' Interagency Autism Coordinating Committee that was created under a provision of the Children 's Health Act of 2000. In addition, I serve as a scientific program staff member of the NIH Autism Co-ordinating Committee, a longstanding body that serves to coordi-nate research efforts within the NIH. We have made much progress in implementing the provisions of the Children 's Health Act of 2000 that focused on NIH research ac- tivities. The act authorized augmentation of autism research activi-ties at the National Institutes of Health and the CDC. First, with regard to the Interagency Autism Coordinating Com- mittee, the Secretary of the Department of Health and HumanServices delegated to NIH the authority to organize the IACC, andNIMH was asked to lead this effort. The IACC has already begun to enhance communication and effective interaction among the sev-eral agencies that support or conduct autism-related research, serv-ice, or educational activities, and it will engage family and advo-cacy groups. VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:56 Autism Coordinating Committee has continued to act within NIH to allow program scientists and directors of the rel-evant institutes to come together to plan and conduct research, andit communicates closely with the IACC. The inaugural meeting ofthe IACC was held in November 2001 on the NIH campus, and itincluded the public members selected by the Secretary. Lee Gross-man, for example, was one of the founding public members of thatcommittee. The date of the second meeting has been set for nextmonth, and we are on schedule, as stipulated in the Children 's Health Act, to have twice-a-year meetings of that committee. In terms of accelerated and expanded research activities, NIH issued a Request for Applications to implement on a fast track therequirement for new Centers of Excellence Programs for autism re-search as specified in the Children 's Health Act. An RFA is a clear statement to the field, setting aside funds, that NIH invites re-search applications in a particular area. These comprehensive cen-ters are to be called STAART Centers, which stands for Studies toAdvance Autism Research and Treatment. A number of applications were received in response to this initial RFA. They were reviewed last month, and the successful applicantswill be funded this summer. A second round of competition has al-ready been posted. It will close in August of this year, and thosesuccessful applicants will be funded in 2003. At that time the fullnetwork of at least five centers stipulated by the law will be inplace. The five participating NIH institutes have established afunding pool of $12 million per year. This past year the NIH ACC also endorsed two other RFAs, one for groups planning to submit center applications this year in orderto allow them to undertake planning activities, and one for innova-tive research into treatments for autism. In addition to these activities, NICHD and NIDCD will competi- tively renew their longstanding Cooperative Program for Excellencein Autism. This program will expand to be essentially the samesize as the STAART program. And in yet another enhancement ofthe NIH autism research portfolio, NIEHS, in collaboration withthe EPA, has funded two new centers focused on autism research. We at NIH are in a heightened state of awareness concerning the need for more research on autism, due to the clear magnitude ofthis major public health problem and due to the work of many peo-ple within and outside this room, and we have been makingprogress. As mentioned earlier, our budget for autism research hasexpanded rapidly over the past few years, more than doubling. Theresearch now in this portfolio, and to be included in the near fu-ture, holds the promise of answers not only for children with au-tism, but also for unlocking the secrets of brain development, whatits possibilities are, how it goes wrong, and when to intervene,which will help all children realize their potential. In summary, NIH is on schedule in terms of implementing the letter and the spirit of all aspects of Title I of the Children 's Health Act, including a broadly based increase in autism research support, VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:56 Jul new Centers of Excellence Program, the exten- sion of the CPEA Program, the enhancement of genetic and otherresources, and the establishment of the Interagency Autism Coordi-nating Committee. I would be happy to answer any questions.[The prepared statement of Dr. Foote follows:] VerDate 11-MAY-2000 Dr. Foote. Dr. Willoughby, does she have any comments? Dr. W ILLOUGHBY . No, sir. Mr. B URTON . You are just there to hold him up if he falls down. [Laughter.] Dr. W ILLOUGHBY . He doesn 't need it. Mr. B URTON . OK. I would like to put a chart up there. Maybe you can explain this to me. The chart on the comparisons, please,the NIH one. Yes. I don 't know if you can see that. Do you have a slide that you can put it on the slide machine, so that they can maybe see itclearly? What that says is that, for diabetes, the yellow line on diabetes shows for fiscal year 2003 there 's $845 million; in fiscal year 2002, the blue line, it is $781.3 million, and in fiscal year 2001, it is$688.1 million. If you look at the middle set of lines, that concerns HIV and AIDS. There is $2,770,000,000 in fiscal year 2003; $2,000,515,000in fiscal year 2002, and $2,247,000,000 in fiscal year 2001. Then that very last part that is very difficult to see, that shows autism. In 2003 it will be $70 million, and in 2002 it will be $65million, and in fiscal year 2001 it is $56 million. Now, according to the statistical data we have, there is about the same number of people who are autistic estimated as there areHIV, and yet the amount of money that is projected to be spent forHIV is going to be almost $3 billion as opposed to $70 million forresearch. Can you explain that to me? Any of you? Dr. F OOTE . Well, I think you know better than I do that these budget figures result from a complex state of affairs that involvesnot only NIH, but Congress, public health issues, and history. Idon't think that I could adequately explain exactly how those num- bers came about. Mr. B URTON . Well, NIH, as I understand, they come up to the Hill and they propose to the appropriators, the Appropriations sub-committees, ''The College of Cardinals '' we call them up here, they propose various amounts of spending or spending levels for variousthings. Can you tell me, in the last 2 or 3 years, how much moneyhas been requested for AIDS research or for diabetes research orfor autism research? Dr. F OOTE . The short answer is no. Mr. B URTON . Well, could you get that for me? Dr. F OOTE . Yes. Mr. B URTON . I would like to know what NIH is asking for. Dr. F OOTE . We can obtain that information for you. Mr. B URTON . Now NIH receives unprogrammed, unallocated funds for research, and I don 't, how much is that? Do you know how much money that is? Well, it is in the billions of dollars. Canyou tell us how the research spending levels are decided over there,the unspecified, unprogrammed moneys? Dr. F OOTE . Yes. NIH has several approaches to funding research. One of the largest is to accept investigator-initiated grant propos-als, which are subjected to peer review. Priority scores are as-signed, and then program officials like myself make final fundingdecisions and budgetary decisions. VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:56 a distribution of funds among basic research funding pools, basic research that is applicable to biomedical research. Thisissue has come up earlier today. For example, as one of the earlierwitnesses pointed out, in an area that is relevant to autism, wesupport a number of studies of brain development, imaging thebrain in children, activities that are relevant to understandingchildhood disorders like autism or attention deficit hyperactivitydisorder. A certain fraction of our funds goes into those basic re-search efforts. There are other funds that are dedicated, in the caseof clinical neuroscience, to efforts to understand specifically braindevelopment in individuals affected with autism, and so forth. Mr. B URTON . Let me interrupt just a minute here. The NIH esti- mates that now 1 in 250 children born will become autistic betweenthe ages of 3 and 8, I believe. Now that is your estimate. That isNIH's estimate. That is an epidemic. That is a major, major prob- lem, and yet only $70 million is going to be allocated for researchin this area in 2003, and only \u2014what did I say \u2014$65 million this fis- cal year. I would suggest that it might be wise to take a look atthose unallocated funds and see if more of that couldn 't be appro- priated or utilized for autism research. The other thing I want to point out to you, and you were here, you have been here for the whole hearing. I am sorry you had towait so long, but they always take longer than we anticipate, espe-cially when we have votes. I want you to look around. Everybody that has a child who be- came autistic shortly after being vaccinated, hold your hands up,please. I want you to look at that. Do you see that? I didn 't put them up to that. But every time we have a hearing \u2014and, inciden- tally, I will hold my hand up, too, because my grandson was a per-fectly normal child, was going to be 6-foot 10. I was planning onhim in the NBA to take care of me in my old age. Within just daysafter getting nine shots in 1 day he was banging his head againstthe wall and running around the wall. And all these people tell you pretty much the same thing. Yet, when we have people from NIH and CDC up here, they continueto tell us, well, we don 't have any information or evidence that these vaccines have anything to do with it. Hold your hands upagain, will you, please? [Significant show of hands.]Mr. B URTON . I want you to look at that. Now I don 't know what you want for evidence, but that ought to be enough to make surethat there is very comprehensive studies done on thimerosal, whichhas mercury in it, that is going into so many children 's vaccines. Now, granted, you are taking it out. You have been up here before, I believe, but I have also men- tioned that every Congressman who gets a flu shot gets thimerosal,too. I told the doctor today, Dr. Eisold, the physician here on Cap-itol Hill, that I am going to inform every single Congressman andCongresswoman and Senator before the next shots are given for flu vaccine that they have mercury being injected into their bodies.Now we all want to get the flu shot, obviously, because we don 't want to have that confused with anthrax and maybe die or some-thing, because the anthrax scare was a real one, and the symptoms VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:56 Jul But we want to make sure that everybody is informed about it. I tell you, most people who had their children vaccinated did not know that they were being injected with mercury. I mentioned ear-lier I think five or six countries that have stopped using thimerosalin their vaccines, and I read a letter from this Russian doctor whosays there is no doubt that it has a bad effect on children who arebeing vaccinated. Yet, we continue to put mercury into these chil-dren, not in one vaccine, but in my grandson 's case, I think it was seven or eight of the nine in 1 day. So I would urge you, and you will be getting a letter from me and the head of the Autism Conference. We will be sending you let-ters signed by probably 50 or 100 Congressman urging you to domore extensive research into the vaccines and into the causes ofautism in the coming years. We 're also going to be contacting the members of the Appropriations Committee to try to earmark fundsfor that, and the people in the audience are going to be contactingeverybody they know that lives and breathes to write to their Con-gressmen and Senators about it as well. [Applause.]Mr. B URTON . Thank you. Thank you. I didn 't request that, either. Dr. Weldon, do you have any questions you would like to ask?Dr. W ELDON . Yes, thank you, Mr. Chairman. I have some ques- tions for Dr. Boyle. Dr. Boyle, you mentioned several studies that the CDC is under- taking in response to the recommendations of the recent IOM. Ihave several questions regarding those studies. First of all, as you know, many Americans are suspect over the ability of the CDC to conduct an unbiased study. Rightly or wrong-ly, these are legitimate concerns. Well, they are concerns, whetheryou feel it is right or wrong. I certainly hope that those concernsare being taken into account. If the research you are doing is to have any real effect on public perceptions, you must make every effort to ensure independence.Otherwise, the CDC will have not achieved its desired goal of re-storing public confidence in the vaccine program. Specifically, to get to my questions, the first study you mentioned using the MADDSP data appears to be an epidemiologic study. Isthat right? There are no biopsies done as part of that study to lookat the presence of measles in the intestinal tracts of these children,correct? Dr. B OYLE . That is correct. Dr. W ELDON . The second study you mentioned is designed to de- termine whether or not the timing of the MMR has any associationwith the onset of regressive autism. Again, this is another epi-demiologic study, correct? Dr. B OYLE . Yes, and, actually, that one is being conducted in con- junction with NIH. Dr. W ELDON . It is? OK. So, again, no biopsy specimens, no tend to look at the gastrointestinal tract. Dr. F OOTE . There are blood samples to examine questions of ex- cretion and blood levels of mercury and immune parameters. VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:56 Jul The third study, I think it is a study out of Den- mark, again, an epidemiologic study, but then you mentioned afourth study? Dr. B OYLE . Actually, that one also has biological markers in it as well. Dr. W ELDON . The third one? Dr. B OYLE . The Denmark study. Dr. W ELDON . The study? Is it serum specimens? Dr. B OYLE . This is done in collaboration with the Danish Na- tional Research Study, and it actually looks at some particular bio-markers. Dr. W ELDON . What are those biomarkers? Dr. B OYLE . Various neurotropins. There is a study that was re- ported last year at the hearing by Dr. Cary Nelson at the NIH thatlooked at some specific neurotropins that may, in fact, be predictorsof autism. So what we 're trying to do with that study is essentially look at whether or not these particular children may be more vul-nerable. Dr. W ELDON . What I really wanted to get though is in the fourth study, you say you are in the early stages of planning this studyto investigate whether or not measles vaccine strain virus ispresent in the intestines of some children with ASD. So is that theone where you are going to try to look at the issues raised by Dr.Wakefield in his reports and Dr. O 'Leary? Ms. W HARTON . There is a study that is still in development. No word has made yet to an investigator to do the study, but, yes,there is a plan to look for the presence of measles virus geno-meno-testinal tissue. Dr. W ELDON . One of the concerns that I have is that the biologi- cal markers is a competent lab. As I understand it, the standardsand the techniques that Dr. O 'Leary uses are not in common use in most labs. They are relatively unique and there are only a smallhandful of labs that are capable of duplicating that work. Is thatcorrect? Ms. W HARTON . Yes, similar methods to what Dr. O 'Leary used were being put in the study, and laboratory work will be done si-multaneously on blinded specimens by a number of different inde-pendent laboratories. Dr. W ELDON . OK. The question I have for you, are you making every effort to make sure that the virology sampling and analysisis of the same quality and caliber as the work that is done by Dr.O'Leary? I am saying this because, if you publish something and if other scientists can nitpick it and say they didn 't use this tech- nique and didn 't use that technique, and the techniques were faulty, then we are not going to restore public confidence in thesystem and we are going to be back to square one. Ms. W HARTON . Yes, I appreciate that, Dr. Weldon, and thank you for making that point. There will be an effort made in this study to use the best virologic techniques available, as well as havingspecimens obtained from patients whose clinical systems are well-characterized, whose vaccinations and disease histories areascertained with appropriate blinding of the specimens. VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:56 Thank you very much. I would like to be notified as soon as possible when you are ready to \u2014I guess you do Request for Proposals associated with that study? Ms. W HARTON . Yes, as far as I know, no specific funding mecha- nism has yet been identified, but we hope to be able to make anaward this fiscal year. Dr. W ELDON . Thank you. Well, please keep my office informed. Dr. Boyle, the epidemiologic study on thimerosal, the preliminary data, as you know, did not show any link with autism, but didshow a statistically significant link with speech development dis-order, and then the final analysis that statistically significant linkdisappeared. There have been a number of people who have wanted to look at that data, and the CDC has not released the datasets. Could youexplain to me why the CDC has not released the datasets on thatinformation? There is some concern that the sampling techniquesused may have diluted down the information. Ms. W HARTON . With your permission, Dr. Weldon, I will respond to that question. There has been a lot of discussion about the dif-ferences in the preliminary analyses of the screening data from theVaccine Safety Data Link with the subsequent studies done. The major differences between the preliminary analyses were that they included followup through 1997. Because of the way theVaccine Safety Data Link works, we receive additional informationeach year regarding subsequent followup on patients. So what hashappened since then is we now have several years of additional fol-lowup on the children who were initially part of the study cohort,which actually should greatly enhance our ability to detectneurodevelopmental problems which may not be diagnosed untilthe children are older. With extension of the study 2 years, from 1997 through 1999, there is an average increase in followup of 23 months. So it is notthat we have diluted it out by including younger children, but wehave extended followup, and that accounts primarily for the dif-ferences in findings between the preliminary analyses and the sub-sequent analyses. Regarding your question about access to the information, as you know, the Vaccine Safety Data Link essentially is electronic medi-cal information of a large number of individuals. There is a strongobligation to maintain the confidentiality of those data. That needhas greatly complicated the ability to make the information, thedataset, available for independent review. However, we appreciate this request and have worked very hard with the individual health maintenance organizations that partici-pate in the Vaccine Safety Link Data Project to identify mecha-nisms through which independent researchers can repeat analysesfrom these sorts of vaccine safety studies while maintaining theconfidential nature of these private medical records, as well as theproprietary interests of the health maintenance organizations thatparticipate in the project. We have been able to develop a process that is quite comparable to that used by the National Center for Health Statistics, usingtheir Research Data Center, so that a dataset can be made avail-able for re-analysis using a protocol that could be developed by VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:56 Jul We have shared this plan with Chairman Burton 's staff. So, in fact, we have been able to solve, I think, the most serious problems related to re-analysis and will be preparedto receive protocols to \u2014\u2014 Dr. W ELDON . To release the data? Ms. W HARTON . It is making the data available for analysis using a protocol that has been written. We can 't release the data because these are confidential medical records, but the data can be madeavailable in a secure setting, so that analyses can be performed byindependent researchers. Dr. B OYLE . I just may add as well, this is a prototype that the National Center on Health Statistics has developed for other typesof confidential information, allowing people access, allowing themto have availability of the resources to actually analyze the data. Dr. W ELDON . Well, what I would like to see is the data made available as soon as possible, so that an independent review \u2014so that the committee can look at the data. Certainly, I understandthe need to maintain patient confidentiality. One other question I have: Dr. Boyle, you were in my office about 2 years ago. We talked about incidence, and you talked about theAtlanta study. It was just getting underway. So, based on the infor-mation you have recently released, the incidence rates that werebeing spoken of, 1 in 250, 1 in 500, and many scientists were ques-tioning that 2 years ago and 3 years ago, you are saying now, yea,verily, at least in Atlanta that it is that high, and it is reasonableto speculate it may be that high throughout the Nation? I knowyou are scientists and you are going to say we have no proof ofthat, but I have been in Atlanta and I have been to lots of othercities. I find it hard to believe that this would be exclusive to BrickTownship and Atlanta. So the rates are really high? Dr. B OYLE . Based on what we found in Atlanta, they are very comparable to what we found in New Jersey. The important partof what we found in Atlanta is that most of, even though we callit autism spectrum disorder, the way we find cases is through ac-cess to school records, and we know that most of those children arechildren who are in special education. Higher-functioning children,children with Asperger 's disorder, or children with higher-function- ing autism may not be captured by those methods. So, in fact, therate, if you look at the whole spectrum, might be a little higher. Dr. W ELDON . Well, I know you are scientists and you won 't be- lieve it is going to rain unless the weather balloons go up andmeasure the humidity in the clouds and the barometric pressure,etc., but, and I think I have said this before at previous hearings,when I started medical school in the seventies, I didn 't know any- body with autism. I never saw any kids with autism. I didn 't know anybody on the faculty with autism. I didn 't know, I never saw a case as I went through all the rotations. The thing that has reallydramatically struck me is I am starting to hear everywhere so-and-so's got a child with autism. I think it is one of these things where the scientists are the last to find out what is going on. I am certainly glad your data verified what everybody has been saying, that we 've got a crisis, and I certainly would encourage you to duplicate the analysis in other locations and try to refine thedata as much as possible, and then continue to track it to see if VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:56 Jul is increasing even further. I certainly appreciate all the work you are doing. I yield back to the gentleman from Connecticut.Thank you very much. Thank you for your testimony.Mr. S HAYS [assuming Chair]. I thank the gentleman. I want to apologize. I don 't usually take the Chair when I haven 't heard the testimony, but Mr. Burton is on the floor of the Houseon an issue that he also cares deeply about, and as we know, heis a very passionate person, thank goodness. I want to ask you a question, Mr. Foote. ''Doctor, '' I'm sorry. I just want to ask you, do you think the title of this hearing is appro-priate in terms of its being an epidemic or would you qualify it ina certain way, and if you would qualify it, how would you qualifyit? It is not a trick question. It sounds like it, but, honestly, it isn 't. Dr. F OOTE . I think it is clear, as Dr. Weldon was saying, that there has been a change. It has been a change that has involveda substantial increase, as in Chairman Burton 's definition of an epidemic as an unexpected large increase in the prevalence of adisorder. Given that definition, I think it is fair for him to use thatterm. I would call it a large increase, and our response, I believe,has been appropriate; that is, that we are mobilizing and we areassembling the structure, and putting it in place, that will provideresources for investigators to undertake large-scale studies thatwould not previously have been possible that are necessary to ad-dress a disorder that is occurring this commonly. That is our goal,and that is what our actions have been: to establish centers whereyoung investigators who are interested in autism can be trained togo on and develop the science that is going to be necessary to haverational treatments for this disorder. There is only so much we can do in a short period of time. Science is an endeavor that takes a lot of training and a certainamount of ramping-up to be able to use funding in an appropriateand very high-quality way. So we are hoping that we are puttingin place the infrastructure that will allow that to happen. Mr. S HAYS . Thank you. That is a very helpful answer. Dr. Boyle, how would you respond to that question?Dr. B OYLE . Well, I guess, rather than sort of fooling with the se- mantics of it, I feel, based on the work that we have done, the workthat many other people have done, that the prevalence of autismis clearly much higher than what we previously thought, and thatwe need to have a concerted response to that issue. I think at CDC we have strived over the last 5 years to do that, both in terms of trying to understand the magnitude of the prob-lem, who 's affected, and then by actually setting up sort of the re- search, epidemiologic capacity, to begin to address why this is hap-pening. It is clearly hard to look retrospectively and say, what was the rate 30 years ago, what was the rate 15 years ago. We don 't have that data assembled. But I think it really shows us that in thiscountry we need to understand that developmental disabilities, in-cluding autism, are extremely important conditions, and conditionsthat we all must take seriously. VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:56 . Let me understand. It is my understanding that CDC is going to actually be reducing its spending next year on autism.Is this accurate, and if so, why would that be happening? Dr. B OYLE . Well, actually, we were appropriated $9.7 million for autism in 2002. We also included additional funding for autism-re-lated activities from the Vaccine Safety Program. I can actually letMelinda talk. We are still going to be expending the $9.7 millionfor autism that is specifically appropriated by Congress for thoseactivities. Mr. S HAYS . Let me just say something, just so I can put this on the record. I don 't fault administrators when we in Congress don 't appropriate the money, but where administrators become respon-sible is when they see a need and they can fill a need, they don 't request the money, and then we in Congress don 't respond. I am getting the sense that in the last years this has been mostly generated by Congress kind of pushing NIH and others to treatthis as a more important effort. I may be wrong, and I am happyto be corrected. But, I 'm sorry, you wanted to make your response? Ms. W HARTON . Well, I was going to elaborate on what Dr. Boyle just said \u2014\u2014 Mr. S HAYS . Sure. Ms. W HARTON [continuing]. About the small reduction that you see in the projected CDC numbers for fiscal year 2003. As Dr.Boyle said, there has been a certain amount of money appropriatedfor autism activities, and that has been supplemented by vaccinesafety appropriations. There have been a number of studieslaunched in response to different issues that have come up relatedto autism that have been initiated in the last couple of years. Someof those studies, the final funding cycle is in fiscal year 2002. Sothat accounts for the apparent reduction. In the fiscal year 2003spending we have only reported to you what we currently antici-pate spending based on the President 's budget, but, of course, if ad- ditional issues arise that require additional studies, those mightvery well be the studies we would end up doing in fiscal year 2003,in response to new concerns or problems that arise. Mr. S HAYS . When a President submits a budget, and I don 't pre- tend to be a big spender, and I voted against spending, so I am notsuggesting where blame lies here, but what I am interested inknowing, though, is if the President and the Budget Director arenot suggesting enough funds for either of your agencies as it re-lates to this effort, have you gone on record as saying you needmore money, not just with Congress? Let me start with the BudgetDirector, or are you basically just accepting whatever has been allo-cated? Dr. B OYLE . This is really not done at my level. I clearly feel like this is an important issue, but it is really done at levels above me. Mr. S HAYS . OK, Dr. Foote. Dr. F OOTE . Well, the same is true for me, but, once again, to point out the way NIH does business, we have to have scientistswho have the skills and the motivation to propose to us, even if wepublicize an RFA, the kind of science that is necessary to addressthe issues. So we need to cultivate fields and we need to developthe competence and the expertise and the people and the resources VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:56 Jul the research possible. More often, that is a matter of sus- tained investment over a period of at least a few years to get fieldsreally ready to take advantage of opportunities. So, yes, we haveconsistently, I think, advocated for that approach to biomedical re-search. Mr. S HAYS . I used to chair the Human Resources Subcommittee of Government Reform and for 4 years had oversight of NIH andCDC, and so on, and FDA as well, and HHS. I am very familiarwith the point you are mentioning. I think it is important to puton the record. But would it be fair to say that you have a pretty good comfort level that if the field was hearing your testimony, that we wouldn 't be flooded with people who say, ''I've come in with proposals and I've been told there isn 't the money ''? Are you pretty comfortable in suggesting to this committee that there aren 't a lot of people out there looking to do research in this area, and that you have to cul-tivate this group? Is this kind of what you are suggesting? Dr. F OOTE . I think if there is appropriate training offered and if the structure that we are establishing and that other institutes atNIH have long supported, such as NICHD and NIDCD with theirCPEA Program, the field expands because this is an interestingproblem. This is a problem that scientists are motivated to get intoand to try to help. There will be growth. As you know, once theseed is there, then sometimes growth can be quite rapid. So I thinkthat is the scenario we are looking at, that in a few years, over thenext few years, there will be investigators coming in with applica-tions, and so on, and we will need to plan for some sustainedgrowth in this area, so that people don 't get disappointed. So that is the scenario we will be trying to plan for, sustained growth. Mr. S HAYS . In our public life, just in our private life, we may come in contact with families and friends who have children thathave different challenges, and autism being one of them, but in ourpublic life, we 're obviously exposed to more families. I find myself thinking, what if I was the parent? I would find myself somewhatfrustrated with traditional medicine, given that it sometimes doesseem to prod, traditional research. I would be very fearful thatthere weren 't things that I was doing to my child, or had done, that may have contributed; in other words, if they were allergic to cer-tain things, and so on. So I have tremendous empathy as to why people don 't want to wait too long, because wouldn 't it be amazing to think that, when we discover something 5 or 10 years from now, we will learn thatthere were things we were doing for our kids, thinking we werehelping them, when we were actually hurting them, and there werethings that we could have done at a younger age that would havemade them well, but at an older age may not have the same im-pact. I know you all have to have that sense as well. I want to ask a few questions that the staff has prepared. So I will be reading a few of these, but I would like to put them on therecord, and I would like the synergy of both of you responding andmaking comment. But, Dr. Foote, this is to you. It relates to Dr. Ruth Kirchstein of NIH. I guess she is the Deputy Director, is that correct? Dr. F OOTE . She is currently the Acting Director of NIH. VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:56 Jul . She published research she conducted in the 1960 's on thermara \u2014\u2014 Dr. F OOTE . Thimerosal. Mr. S HAYS [continuing]. Thimerosal, yes. Dr. F OOTE . Yes. Mr. S HAYS . Our staff has been seeking to speak to her about this research and what other research she conducted relative to this. Iam interested if you or anyone else at NIH is looking at this issue,and whether she will be getting back in touch with our staff. Weneed some cooperation from her, frankly. Dr. F OOTE . I can carry that message back. [Applause.]Mr. S HAYS . Let me just say something to our guests. In this hearing it is truly a hearing, and so I want to respect your inter-ests, but it is important that we have decorum. Dr. F OOTE . My understanding is that was an FDA research ef- fort. So I think probably it is also appropriate to request of FDAwhatever documentation they have. Mr. S HAYS . Can we, given that you are before our committee, can we anticipate that you will certainly try to help us in this regard? Dr. F OOTE . You can anticipate that we have heard what you have said, and that we will carry the message back, yes. Thank you, Mr.Chairman. Mr. S HAYS . Isn 't it going to be important to evaluate the real- world treatment approach in autism and not just one therapy at atime? Let me just repeat the whole question. And don 't you think it would be important to find a practice-based research center thatis providing care for individuals with autism, so that we can trackcutting-edge treatments in real-world situations? Dr. F OOTE . Well, the issue of treatment, obviously is a primary one for families faced with an affected individual. As we were justdiscussing, it may be some time before there is a treatment found-ed and based on the pathophysiology of the disorder and derivedin some rational way that really has a silver bullet approach to thisdisorder. In the meantime, people, of course, need to be trying tohelp their children, and doing it in as timely a way as possible, andin a way that is guided as much as possible by reliable information. So NIH has in place several research programs focused on treat- ment. The CPEA networks have strong treatment components uti-lizing treatments that families are making use of right now, aimedat evaluation of their effectiveness and, as has been mentionedmany times, which subset of affected individuals that treatmentmight be most appropriate for. When we issued the RFA for the new STAART centers, the one requirement, absolute requirement, we had was that each applica-tion had to include a treatment component, a treatment study, andfor a center to be considered to be fundable it had to have at leastone treatment study that got strong ratings from the Peer ReviewCommittee. So it has been our intention all the way along that inthis major new effort treatment would be an inherent and majorpart of the overall effort. Then I might note, finally, that this past year the NIH Autism Coordinating Committee issued an RFA as the result of which wefunded seven applications having to do with new approaches to VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:56 Jul we have funded those seven grants to get them going. So we are trying to undertake an effort where we are devel-oping basic science for long-term treatment, but we are also doingthese very much more immediate efforts where people have to findtreatments; they have to use treatments now. People look for evi-dence. They say, ''I want to use the kind of treatment that has the best evidence supporting it, '' and they often find that they go and look and the evidence base is very fragmentary, anecdotal, highlyvariable. It is not clear to them what to do when faced with thisentire array of possible treatments. So we have undertaken effortsto try to help to deal with that as well. Mr. S HAYS . Thank you. I am going to have the staff ask these questions, and ask as many as you want. I am going to listen tothem. I might jump in, but I think that we might cover this morequickly to do it that way, given that they are going to be a littlemore familiar with your responses as well. Ms. C LAY. Dr. Foote, when can we expect the NIH intramural program to replicate Dr. Wakefield 's research? Dr. F OOTE . I'm sorry, there was a distraction. When can we ex- pect the intramural research program? I 'm sorry, is that what you said? Ms. C LAY. Yes. When can we expect children to be able to be seen at the NIH Clinical Center who have autism and who alsohave gastrointestinal issues to be investigated in the same mannerthat Dr. Wakefield did? Dr. F OOTE . I don 't know the answer to that. I would be glad to find out the answer to that and furnish it to you. Mr. S HAYS . That would be helpful. Thank you. Ms. C LAY. Yes. Isn't it going to be important for the program at the NIH Clinical Center to be expanded for autism? Dr. F OOTE . It sounds to me like that is addressing basically the same issue of what is happening on the NIH campus in terms ofthe ability of people to access that facility and get advice and po-tentially care, or enter into clinical trials, through that particularfacility. I am afraid I don 't know the answer to that. I will have to find out, but we will try to provide an answer that encompassesboth of those questions. Ms. C LAY. Dr. Boyle, we have talked about the CDC 's Vaccine Safety Data Link project today. You have been tracking for 10years vaccine adverse events through several HMOs. The commit-tee asked for the raw data a couple of years ago, and we were toldwe could not have it because the HMOs were threatening to pullout of the project. We have learned that at least one pharma-ceutical company has had access to the data through one of theHMOs and that other individuals have tried to receive this datathrough Freedom of Information Act and been denied. Why has the pharmaceutical industry been given preferential treatment? Ms. W HARTON . The study in question was actually done by one of the participating HMOs and was not a Vaccine Safety Data Linkproject. These individual HMOs each have their own research orga-nizations which make their own arrangements with outside enti-ties, including universities, pharmaceutical companies, vaccine VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:56 do research using their patient popu- lation. The particular study you are referring to, which I believe was initially on the list of VSD studies actually shouldn 't have been on that list because it wasn 't a VSD study. It was a study engaged in by one of the individual organizations in corroboration with a man-ufacturer, which they do many studies in terms of post-licensuresafety studies, for example, these individual organizations. Ms. C LAY. So your position is that no pharmaceutical company has had access to the Vaccine Safety Data Link project tapes at all? Ms. W HARTON . That is my understanding. Mr. S HAYS . Could you verify that? In other words, would you check that out? Ms. W HARTON . Yes, we can get back to you on that, but that is my understanding. Mr. S HAYS . And would you, in getting back, confirm yes or no? In other words, if your answer is the same, don 't not get back to us; say that you have confirmed your answers. Ms. W HARTON . Yes, I will do that. Thank you. Mr. S HAYS . Thank you very much. Ms. C LAY. In reviewing the publications that were provided to us from the CDC from this project, it appeared that an equal or morenumber of these projects were not looking at vaccine safety issues,but were looking at ways to increase immunization rates. Is thatan accurate assessment? Ms. W HARTON . I'm sorry, I can 't answer your specific question. Ms. C LAY. We were given about 45 published studies. Fourteen of them were looking at potential adverse event correlations doingvaccines. Another 14 or more were specific studies looking at howto improve immunization rates. So, in other words, how we weregoing to have increased uptake of vaccine usage within the HMOs,not at all about vaccine safety. Ms. W HARTON . Well, the Vaccine Safety Data Link is used by the participating investigators to answer a variety of questions, includ-ing disease incidence, other issues beyond those related to vaccinesafety, but it is still done within the same constraints of the sys-tem; that is, maintaining confidentiality of the patient records. Ms. C LAY. Well, given the need to find out the issues of vaccine safety and the lack of research looking at adverse events, and thatthe creation of this project was specifically to look at adverseevents, wouldn 't it be important to put our focus there first? Ms. W HARTON . Well, I appreciate your comments, and I can as- sure you that the people who are directly involved with the VSDproject share your concern that the primary focus of the project hasto be vaccine safety. The other projects that have been donethrough the system have really been, in general, smaller projectsthat have not required use of substantial resources. This systemwas created for vaccine safety, and vaccine safety continues to beits primary focus. Ms. C LAY. And who at the CDC makes the decision of what projects can and cannot be conducted with the access to this data? Ms. W HARTON . It actually is not CDC 's decision. It is a collabo- rative project involving a number of health maintenance organiza-tions, which, as I noted earlier, have their own research structures VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:56 Jul principal investigators. This group collaboratively re- views protocols and makes decisions about what are appropriateuses of VSD resources. Ms. C LAY. And as we move forward in having protocol estab- lished for outside experts to have access to this data, can we be as-sured that the data will be available fairly, and that there will beno reduction of access to the projects that they are requesting thedata for? Ms. W HARTON . Well, clearly, it is our intent to make the dataset available for re-analysis. A protocol will need to be developed andwill need to be approved by the institutional review boards of theparticipating health maintenance organizations, but, yes, thedataset will be made available, the appropriate dataset will bemade available for the re-analysis. Ms. C LAY. Can we be assured then that if a researcher wants to conduct an independent analysis of Dr. Verstraeten 's study, that can be done without bias? Ms. W HARTON . You have asked a difficult question, and I may not be giving you quite the answer you are anticipating. Actually,I think there are some real issues with Dr. Verstraeten 's study, and the epidemiological term for that is ''bias. '' But, yes, what needs to be done is a protocol developed that will specify what dataare needed for analysis, and those data will be provided in this con-fidential, in this secure setting of the Research Data Center at theNational Center for Health Statistics using the existing model, fol-lowing IRB approval. Mr. S HAYS . Does the gentlelady, Ms. Watson, have questions that she would like to ask? We are having staff just pursue some ques-tions, but if you have some questions or comments, I would love torecognize you. Ms. W ATSON . Let me just first thank the committee for holding this hearing. Since I am so late, I am wondering if there was a con-nection made between the fumes and the toxicity from mercury inthe amalgams and autism. All right, we had kind of reached andbridged a gap. We thought there was some kind of connection. Mr. S HAYS . If you would like to just ask a question or two about that, we would be happy to have you do that. Ms. W ATSON . Yes. Let me ask those from CDC, I 'm carrying a piece of legislation that will prohibit the use of mercury in dentalfillings. Fifty percent of that silver that they call silver is reallymercury. The bill will outlaw eventually the use of it at all, but wewant people very well informed when they go in to have fillings. Can someone comment on whether there has been a connection made between mercury fillings and autism? Does that ring a bellwith anyone? Dr. B OYLE . I'm Dr. Boyle from Ms. W ATSON . Yes. Dr. B OYLE . As far as I know, there has been no study that spe- cifically addressed that issue in terms of dental fillings and autism. Ms. W ATSON . Yes. Dr. B OYLE . No, there has not been a connection, but also there has not been specific studies. Ms. W ATSON . In my literature that we have collected around the bill, there has been some reference to not only autism, but serious VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:56 Jul brain deterioration suspected coming from that toxic substance that is emanating from the fillings. So I would like to letyou know that my door and mail is open. If there is anything thatyou find in the literature that you could share with our office, itwould certainly help us. My staff is just handing me a note that is saying in some of the vaccines thimerosal contains mercury, and it is a kind of preserva-tive, and it goes into the filling. So what we are looking for is anyresearch, evidence, that would indicate a connection. Thank you. Mr. S HAYS . Does the gentlelady from California have any other questions she would like to make? Ms. W ATSON . No, Mr. Chairman. Mr. S HAYS . I am going to have the staff continue to ask ques- tions. If you are still here and want to jump in, you could do that. Ms. W ATSON . Let me just ask one more question. Mr. S HAYS . Sure. No, you have the floor. Ms. W ATSON . In your research, is it true that autism continues throughout a lifetime or can autism come to some point where theperson comes back to very normal growth? Can someone commenton that? Dr. F OOTE . Well, I think the observations are that it is a lifetime disorder with sometimes quite striking remission in certain symp-tom domains. The communication disorder, the communicationproblems, for example, can improve substantially. People havestriking luck with certain kinds of treatments for parts of the dis-order in certain children. But these tend to be sporadic, partial al-leviation of the disorder rather than a sustained and total remis-sion. Ms. W ATSON . Can the disorder be affected, say, for the good through a change in nutrition? Is there any evidence? Dr. F OOTE . There have been reports \u2014we were just talking a lit- tle bit earlier about the fact that the number of appropriatelyblinded, placebo-controlled studies in autism are several, literallyseveral studies in the entire literature that have been very welldone. Nutritional changes haven 't been one of the domains in which there have been really careful studies. So there are examples of alleviation of symptoms with dietary changes or nutritional supplements, but those tend to be anecdotal;that is, stories about a few to several people rather than carefullycontrolled clinical trials. Ms. W ATSON . Are autism patients treated individually? The con- dition can change for the better, but it still stays with them for therest of their life? So my question is, can they be treated individ-ually or is there a protocol? Dr. F OOTE . Well, because we do not have broadly effective, stand- ardized, rigorously demonstrated treatments, and people are con-fronted with serious difficulties in day-to-day life with an autisticchild, people search for treatments. So, given that the typical storyis that a given child will be exposed to several different treatment regimes over a period of time, the most broadly used treatmentstend to be behavioral treatments rather than drug or other kindsof treatments. There are certain behavioral treatments, educationaltreatments, that with sustained large investments of time and ef- VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:56 show substantial improvement in a large fraction of chil- dren. I think that is a fair statement. Ms. W ATSON . Institutionalization is one way to deal with this disorder. What percentage of those identified during their schoolyears go into institutions, or do you have that information? Dr. F OOTE . I don 't have that information. Ms. W ATSON . Anyone? Dr. B OYLE . From our work in Atlanta and Brick, there were no children who were currently institutionalized. Ms. W ATSON . There are no children in Atlanta or no children in your studies in the children that you know of? Dr. B OYLE . In our studies of trying to establish the prevalence of autism, there are no children who were institutionalized. How-ever, the whole issue of institutionalization in children, I meanthere is clearly very few children who are currently institutional-ized. Ms. W ATSON . Throughout the country? Dr. B OYLE . Again, this is just in Atlanta and New Jersey. Ms. W ATSON . Just in Atlanta. So you don 't have any information countrywise? That is something I would like to know. I know inCalifornia they do institutionalize. I know in Massachusetts theyinstitutionalize. I am just wondering how prevalent it is across thecountry. Thank you. Mr. S HAYS . Dr. Foote and Dr. Boyle, let me just say it is our in- tention to let you get out pretty soon. You haven 't had a break or anything. Do you have 20 more minutes in you? Are you OK? I am going to do something that may seem a little unusual, and I may have to just cut it off if it is not a good idea. But, Dr. Footeand Dr. Boyle, if you can trust me in terms of my ability to controla meeting, it is not lost on me that we have a lot of people in theaudience who have a keen direct interest. There may be a questionor two that none of us on the panel here have asked that we shouldhave. I am going to ask if there is someone in the audience whomay have a question that says we should have addressed this. Iwill allow you to stand up and tell the committee, and then we maychoose, our committee may choose to ask that question. My motivation is that it would be a shame to have people leave without you having the opportunity to respond and maybe clearsomething up. Both of you have such a nice, friendly smile. I fig-ured I could get away with it. So we are going to try it out, butI have the counsel \u2014excuse me, the minority counsel would like to ask you a few questions, the majority professional staff would justlike to ask a few more, and then I am going to just throw it outto the audience, pick two or three of you and ask you to stand andtell me if there is a question you think we should have asked, loudenough so I can repeat it to our witnesses. There you go. So I will recognize the minority counsel. Yes? Mrs. Morella, I had asked if there was any question, and I had been toldyou didn 't have any. Would you like the floor? Mrs. M ORELLA . I would love it. Mr. S HAYS . You have the floor as long as you would like. Mrs. M ORELLA . Particularly because I represent the National In- stitutes of Health, and, Dr. Foote, I am glad you are here, and I VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:56 Jul closely with CDC, and I am glad you are here, Dr. Boyle, too. I was here for the first panel and heard the kinds of questions or the points that they brought out. I think one of the notes thatI had jotted down was they felt there was a need to develop a na-tional policy, that we needed more collaboration, that we needed tomatch the child to the method. We pointed out the fact that there are just so many questions that are still unanswered. Funding was stressed by I think everymember of that first panel. I am not sure \u2014if you would kind of comment on whether you see, what do you see is really necessary?Is it the need for further collaboration? Will funding alone do it?How do we get some of these questions answered, particularly alsowith regard to vaccines and what their connection is to autism? Ifany of you would like to comment on that just general area? Dr.Boyle. Dr. B OYLE . I will start. I took some notes, too, during the last panel. I would applaud the issue of collaboration. I think we havemade a good start across not just NIH and CDC, but all the agen-cies involved. The Department of Education, the Health Servicesand Resources Administration, all of these agencies need to worktogether to address this issue. Mrs. M ORELLA . Should we do something about that? I mean, is there direction we should be offering? Dr. B OYLE . I think the direction from Congress from the Child Health Act clearly directed collaborations. It directed, I think, toCDC and NIH, but other partners have clearly been pulled intothat. I think that we need to continue to make that happen, as wellas work with all of the parent groups that are seated behind ushere. I applaud the effort of hearing from the parents at the end of the committee hearing today. So I would definitely second that notion. The other thing I heard about was, though, the issue of training.Mrs. M ORELLA . Yes. Dr. B OYLE . And this is training across the board. I think a lot has happened in the last 5 years in terms of both epidemiology re-searchers, diagnosticians, treatment issues. I think that we havemade clear progress, but I do think this is an area that we needto put concerted energies into. There is a lot of interest in autism and other neurodevelopmental disorders, and we want to continue to have that momentum hap-pening it and growth in positive ways. Mrs. M ORELLA . Dr. Foote, I would love to give you an oppor- tunity to respond to any of those facets. Dr. F OOTE . Well, the Children 's Health Act called for the estab- lishment of an Interagency Autism Coordinating Committee. Wenow have that up and running. There is, of course, always a bigdistance between sitting down in the same room and talking andconverting that into something that resembles a national policy oreven a coherent picture of what it is that is being done, which, ofcourse, helps you identify what isn 't being done. But I think at our first meeting, and I think on the agenda for our second meeting of that committee, those are exactly the jobsthat we are taking on. I think we have the appropriate representa- VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:56 committee to be able to do that in a realistic way. So I think if there is going to be a national agenda about autism, Ithink that there is a kernel for starting that with the InteragencyAutism Coordinating Committee. Mrs. M ORELLA . Maybe this committee hearing will help to spur that on. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I am pleased also to note your new concept of involving the audience, involving the parents. Mr. S HAYS . Well, we have done it before and it has worked, but it does take cooperation. Mrs. M ORELLA . Right. Mr. S HAYS . We will give it a try in a second. Excuse me for not calling on you; I apologize. I think it was the nervousness of think-ing how we were going to do the latter. [Laughter.] I recognize minority counsel.Ms. D ESPRES . Thank you. I have just a couple of questions re- garding that request for the Vaccine Safety Data Link data. I waswondering if you could explain to us why the privacy concerns areso important. I am particularly interested in what could happen tothe VSD if the participating HMOs didn 't believe that there was adequate control over patient confidentiality. Ms. W HARTON . Well, in fact, I think just the fact that this discus- sion has been ongoing for so long has convinced all of them thatthere is no longer assurance that the data can be maintained in aprivate way at CDC. The individual participating organizations areno longer sending master datasets to CDC. I think that unlessthese issues can be resolved, the project is likely to no longer bepossible to continue. What we have tried to do is develop a new way of doing studies where, in fact, the data won 't reside at CDC, but the analyses will be done in a distributed way among the participating organiza-tions. This is something which is theoretically possible to do, butoperationally would clearly require much more in the way of datamanagement and statistical support of the individual sites, as wellas at CDC. So I think, in effect, it will reduce the amount of workthat will be possible for us to accomplish within the VSD with ex-isting resources. Ms. D ESPRES . Can you explain to us, if the VSD is not able to continue, what would be the implications for vaccine safety re-search in the future? I am also curious about the implications ofthe fact that the data currently is not at CDC. What present impli-cations on vaccine safety research has that had and what implica-tions could it have in the future. Ms. W HARTON . Well, at the moment we, as I understand it, have not yet received any of the year 2000 data because none of the or-ganizations are currently willing to send it to us. So we are notcurrently able to perform any studies easily in terms of screeninganalysis that requires access to the year 2000 data. Now, again,the data do reside at the individual sites and can be accessed inthis distributed way, but it is far more laborious. Should the project cease to exist, I think it would dramatically change \u2014it would be a great loss for us. The VSD has provided a mechanism through which vaccine safety concerns could be rapidlyaddressed, and often reassurance provided in a very prompt way VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:56 Jul comes up. Now many issues are complex and do require more detailed investigation beyond what can get from ana-lyzing the automated data tape, and do require chart review, andso forth. Those studies are more complicated and take longer toperform, but the VSD has really been one of the bedrocks of ourvaccine safety system. I think its loss would be a great one. Dr. B OYLE . Can I add a comment to that as well? I think that this actually has had a ripple effect with the HMOs. We are deal-ing with other issues where we would like to have a rapid responseand work with the HMOs because they are a wealth of informationand data, and they are reluctant to participate because of these pri-vacy issues. Ms. D ESPRES . So without having VSD data now and the possibil- ity that you won 't have it at all in the future, would that mean that it could take longer to detect vaccine adverse effects? Ms. W HARTON . It clearly would take longer. It would clearly be more laborious. It clearly would be more resource intensive, and wewould be unable to accomplish as much. Ms. D ESPRES . I don 't have any more questions. Thank you. Mr. S HAYS . I thank you very much. It is important to get on the record. I appreciate it. I recognize the majority professional staff.Ms. C LAY. Aren 't some of the privacy concerns as a result of the HIPAA regulations that are about to be implemented? Ms. W HARTON . Some of the privacy concerns do overlap with HIPAA issues. There are additional State requirements in some ofthe States in which these organizations persist. But it is a generalissue that we have to assure the confidentiality of these data. Ms. C LAY. And is their not providing the tapes to you a violation of the contract that you have with the association that overseesthese HMOs? Ms. W HARTON . We are in the process of trying to develop a new procurement mechanism that will allow development of this dis-tributed model. Ms. C LAY. One of the correlations that we have looked at be- tween the issue of mercury in medicine and exposure for our chil-dren is the same process that we went through in the 20th centurylooking at lead in paint and its effect on children. How does thisissue correlate, the CDC and the NIH response correlate for mer-cury as it did to lead in the paint 50 years ago? Dr. B OYLE . Well, I will start first. One of the things that we are hoping to be able to do with our State-based program is to be ableto monitor, and we call it, from an ecological standpoint. The impli-cations you have had were in terms of looking at lead. But we arehoping to be able to look over time at the prevalence of autismbased on our State-based monitoring program and how that preva-lence may have been impacted based on the removal of thimerosalfrom vaccines. Dr. F OOTE . I think the NIH response to the thimerosal issues has been to undertake a series of research projects looking at metabo-lism, and distribution of ethyl-mercury in the body, rates of clear-ance, and potential toxic effects. There are several such research ef-forts now underway, some of which, as we discussed earlier, and VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:56 Jul with CDC. So I think this is a serious and appro- priate response to those issues. Ms. C LAY. And, Dr. Foote, if a parent, when they have a newly diagnosed child, goes to the NIH Web site and looks for informationon therapies for the child, will they find adequate information? Dr. F OOTE . Well, we have a joint linkage with the National Li- brary of Medicine in which there are large amounts of data avail-able. The real problem is one of the underlying science and the un-derlying science not being adequately developed. Anybody would bedaunted right now in attempting to sift through that information.I don 't think it is as much a matter of organizing the information as it is of literally developing the information, and that is the effortthat we have underway. So, yes, we have taken seriously the taskof having an interface with the public that makes information ac-cessible to them, but our real job and the real effort that is goingto solve this problem is to have better information available. Mr. S HAYS . Now let me state what I would like to do. I would like to let our witnesses leave soon. I would like to just say thatthis is a hearing of the House of Representatives, of Congress, sothe decorum needs to be done well. I am going to first ask how many people would like to ask the question. I am going to invite five people to take each of those fiveseats. I am going to invite you, Ma 'am, in the front row to come up to that seat up there, yes. I am going to invite you in the veryback to come up, the very back there. I am going to invite you, sir,to come up. I am going to invite you, Ma 'am, in the middle, and I am going to invite you in the very back there. I am going to have you each take a seat. What I am going to in- vite each of you to do, the committee is going to invite each of you,you are just going to go down and you are going to identify yourname, as you ask the question, where you live. If you have a lovedone who is impacted, we are happy to have you share the name ofyour child, but this is primarily for an opportunity to ask a ques-tion. We will just see how it goes. OK? You all are nice \u2014thank you \u2014to let us do this. Just turn the mic on, start at the very end, and ask your ques- tion. Ms. M INTZ. Hi. My name is Sandy Mintz. I am from Anchorage, AK. I am lucky enough not to have a child who has been injuredby a vaccine. My question is, is NIH ever planning on doing a study using the only proper control group, that is, never vaccinated children? Dr. F OOTE . I am not aware of \u2014but note carefully what I said, that I am not aware of \u2014a proposed study to use a suitably con- structed group of never vaccinated children. Now CDC would bemore likely perhaps to be aware of such an opportunity. Dr. B OYLE . The study that I mentioned earlier that we are doing in collaboration with Denmark compares children who received the MMR vaccine versus children who did not receive MMR. Ms. M INTZ. But I am saying never vaccinated with any vaccine. That assumes that other vaccines don 't cause autism, which is what needs to be studied, not assumed. VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:56 Jul . Let me just say that if you would turn off your mic, I am happy to have you do the followup, if you would respond toit. Ms. M INTZ. I'm sorry. Mr. S HAYS . No, you don 't need to apologize. And we will go to the next. Do you have any other comment based on that? The pointthat is being made, any vaccination. Could we just suggest that youtake this under advisement? Ms. W HARTON . The difficulty with doing such a study in the United States, of course, is that a very small portion of childrenhave never received any vaccines, and these children probably dif-fer in other ways from vaccinated children. So performing such astudy would, in fact, be quite difficult. The Denmark study was a study that, in fact, could not have been done in the United States, although, of course, these childrendid potentially receive some other vaccines, but simply hadn 't re- ceived MMR. Mr. S HAYS . I will invite anyone who is here to speak to staff or me afterwards if they want to augment a comment. Let's go to the second person. I am sorry, I don 't know your name. So I can 't call you by name. So you are going to be a number to me. Ms. S TEWART . OK. Mr. S HAYS . You are No. 2. Ms. S TEWART . OK. My name is Dr. Linda Stewart. I am from New York. I am coming from Switzerland. I have been working inSwitzerland for 30 years in the political and internal affairs inter-national arena. I am also a mother of a son, my No. 2 son, whohas been recently diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder. Mr. S HAYS . How old is your son now? Ms. S TEWART . He is 8. Mr. S HAYS . OK. Ms. S TEWART . We returned to the United States, as he was born and vaccinated in Florida. We had been to four or five neurologistsin Europe, the highest doctors we could find in France, Switzer-land, Italy, and we came to the United States to find out if wecould find any help for the boy since he was born and vaccinatedhere. All the tests, MRIs \u2014\u2014 Mr. S HAYS . Let me ask you, can you do your question, if you could, yes? Ms. S TEWART . Yes. All our tests showed normal, and we were able to find a program by residents from NASA that showed thechild was full of mercury. My question to you, respectfully, as sci-entists and researchers, what results, with all the millions that Ihear you mention back and forth today, what have been your re-sults in a pragmatic and functional level for the millions of re-search that you have received in biological autism? Dr. F OOTE . The types of studies that happened and are underway are studies about the levels of mercury that result from vaccinationand are about the timing of the onset of autism symptoms in re-gressive and/or non-regressive autism and how those may be ormay not be systematically related to the time of vaccination. VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:56 Jul data are in; some of those studies are currently being conducted, and some of those studies are still being orga-nized. The data are not yet in. But the money is on the table. Thestudies have been funded and they are underway. Ms. S TEWART . Thank you. Mr. S HAYS . No. 3. Ms. W EDEWER . Hi. My name is L.D. Wedewer. I am the U.S. Au- tism Ambassador, and I have more titles than my arms, so I willleave it at that. But I have a two-part question actually. My daughter received a hepatitis B shot at 2 days old, which I truly feel was too young,but I was never given any information on the cause and effect,what could happen to her. Do you feel that there is a need to en-sure that parents have the knowledge of what the mercury coulddo to the individual, and how would we assure that? Ms. W HARTON . Well, clearly, we do try to inform parents of the known risks and benefits of vaccination through vaccine informa-tion statements, which are required by the National Vaccine InjuryCompensation Act passed by Congress some time ago. The mercury is no longer contained in any of the hepatitis B vac- cines administered to infants or thimerosal is not, and thimero-sal\u2014the vaccines now being routinely administered to children, in fact, none of them contain thimerosal at this point. There are not data to \u2014there are no established harms associated with this. I know this is a subject of great concern, and a numberof studies are underway, but we do not have data that supportknown hazards associated with thimerosal contained in vaccines atthis point. Ms. W EDEWER . OK, and my second part to the question is I have, as the U.S. Ambassador, I have been receiving over the last yearnumerous information and different amounts of proof on the thi-merosal connection, Ma 'am, as my daughter is one of them. I had found a recent CDC report that had never been released that hadbirth to 6 months, and yet the release that you released to the pub-lic and congressional hearings omitted birth to 6 months. Is therea reason why the original report and the second report do notmatch? Ms. W HARTON . Well, this is an issue that was addressed earlier. I believe the study you are referring to is Dr. Thomas Verstraeten 's analysis of the VSD screening data. Ms. W EDEWER . I actually have it here today, if you would like to have it in front of you, so you know \u2014\u2014 Mr. S HAYS . No, but she is on target, right? She got the study. Ms. W EDEWER . OK, go ahead. Mr. S HAYS . Yes. Ms. W HARTON . And as I mentioned earlier, the initial studies fo- cused on a limited followup period. Since that time, there has beenmore extensive followup which should actually enhance the findingof children whose subsequent developmental abnormalities were di- agnosed later in life. So more extensive followup should help us doa better study. Ms. W EDEWER . OK, my final, this is the final part to it, and I promise I will let Mr. Horowitz go on. My last concern \u2014and, re- VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:56 from many, many parents; I was in- ducted by more than 245,000 people, so I \u2014\u2014 Mr. S HAYS . Ask your question. Why don 't you ask it. Ms. W EDEWER . I have U.S. knowledge. May I ask, why, then, if you are so worried about releasing the statistics from the parentsto a congressional hearing, as I do work with Democrats, etc., inIowa, do you really think \u2014as a parent of a child with autism, I don't think that I would have a problem with you releasing the in- formation for someone else to look at. Do you really think thatother parents would have problem with that, when everybody theysee\u2014\u2014 Mr. S HAYS . OK, you have asked your question. Now I am going to have you move the mic, so I know you are not going to have afourth followup. Ms. W EDEWER . OK. [Laughter.] Mr. S HAYS . OK. Ms. W HARTON . Well, it is not just parents of children who have neurodevelopmental abnormalities. It is all the patients participat-ing in these health maintenance organizations, which is a measur-able proportion of the U.S. population, have data on every medicalencounter and every diagnosis they have received. I think these aredata which have to be maintained confidentially. We have no choiceabout that. Mr. S HAYS . Thank you. We have two more to go, and you all have been wonderful. Yes, sir, you are No. 4. Turn the mic on, if youwould. Mr. H OROWITZ . Thank you. My name is Dr. Len Horowitz. I am here representing an organization nationwide called VaccinationLiberation, as well as I am an Honorary Autism Ambassador, andI appreciate this opportunity. My question is not simply for the good representatives here, but also for all of us to consider. We have currently in the last severalyears particularly become very aware of the tobacco industry andits infusion into what amounts to cancer sticks, a variety of ingre-dients that the industry itself knew was totally toxic. The evidencebefore this committee, I understand, including the Verstraeten re-port, indicates clearly the Centers for Disease Control and other in-dustry officials knew well in advance that mercury, as well as po-tentially aluminum, formaldehyde, formalin derivatives, as well asforeign species DNA, RNA, proteins, cause a horrific number of in-juries. The question that I have is, how, as we begin to spend millions of dollars and give to these same organizations who have thisknowledge, how can we assure that putting virtually the fox incharge of the hen house do we expect this autism pandemic or epi-demic here in the United States to stop without a full house-cleaning within the NIH, CDC, NAID, NIMH, and FDA, freeingthis bureaucracy from special pharmaceutical industry biases andinfluences, especially since the lives of our children, our Nation 's future is at great and grave risk? Mr. S HAYS . OK, let me say, you are not going to have a followup on that one because that was such a long question, and it did havea sense of bias as well as a statement, but it is an important ques-tion to put on the record. VerDate 11-MAY-2000 09:56 't know if you all want to address it. It was thrown out to all of us. Do you want to just make any response? I mean, Dr.Foote, can you \u2014let me try to narrow it down a little bit. Given that we did know that there are a lot of things that we have allowed to happen where we knew they shouldn 't, how do we sort that out? In other words, in Congress, in the private sector aswell, I mean we could say with hindsight we know it shouldn 't have happened. We can say, well, some people in a company mayhave known, but maybe not everyone. Just he deserves some typeof response. Ms. W HARTON . Well, I would call into question the initial state- ment that we know that all these additives are in vaccines and weknow that they cause harm. Mr. S HAYS . Right. Ms. W HARTON . In fact, that is not known. The Institute of Medi- cine has reviewed the data regarding IOM and autism and hasfound that the evidence favors rejection of a connection betweenMMR vaccine and autism. As far as the thimerosal issue is con-cerned, the evidence is too incomplete and fragmentary to makeany decisions about causation. Of course, many substances are known to be dangerous when ad- ministered in high concentrations, but the additives that are in-cluded in vaccines are present in trace amounts, and even whenmultiple vaccines are given, these are still very small amounts ofproducts. It is not established even that thimerosal is associatedwith any harm as a vaccine additive. That said, we have committed a large amount of staff time and funding to try to further elaborate these issues and have designeda whole series of studies that have been described in our writtentestimony that we believe will help address these issues and are re-sponsive to the specific research recommendations made to us bythe Institute of Medicine. Mr. S HAYS . Thank you. I am going to respond and say that some of our most dedicated employees are in the very institutions youhave mentioned. So I would dispute that we need a cleaning of thehouse, but I do think \u2014\u2014 Mr. H OROWITZ . Just in terms of those biases by special interests, currently, the waivers bother me, the fact that we have CDC offi-cials and ASIP officials in the vaccine \u2014\u2014 Mr. S HAYS . You know what we are going to do \u2014\u2014 Mr. H OROWITZ [continuing]. That get these waivers \u2014\u2014 Mr. S HAYS [continuing]. We are going to allow you to have dialog directly with the staff about this afterwards, and the staff will stay. Let me just go to No. 5, and then you all have been very trust- worthy, and I thank you, and I know it is tempting to jump in, butyou won 't be given an opportunity. We are going to five, and then you all are going to get home. Ms. B IGELOW . Hi. I am Rita Bigelow. I have an 11-year-old boy with autism. I just want to say thank you to the Congressmen andwomen who are here helping us with this cause, and also to thepeople from the NIH. Thank you for listening to us, answering ourquestions. Mr. S HAYS . And CDC. Ms. B IGELOW . And CDC. Sorry. VerDate 11-MAY-2000 Ms. B IGELOW . I am with the Autism Coalition and with other groups. I see many of my friends who are here, too. So thanks toall of them for making the trip down. I have a question that is a little bit taking a different tack, but I worked with several researchers in autism, tried to raise moneyfor them, and worked with them. It seems that most scientists be-lieve that autism is caused by a combination of genetic and envi-ronmental triggers. My specific question, and I don 't have a part B, but, what types of steps has the NIH taken to promote genetic studies? You know,the genes may perhaps interact with environmental triggers, withpsycho-pharmacologic agents, things like that. Dr. F OOTE . So the CPEA network that has been funded for the past several years by NICHD and NIDCD has a coordinated genet-ics program, their Centers of Excellence in Neurobiologic and Ge-netics of Autism, where they have multiple sites at which they col-lect genetic data from subjects. The advantage of having multiplesites being that you can collect from them a much larger cohortthan you could ever do having individual investigators operatingjust within their own spheres. So it provides power to genetic anal-yses that couldn 't otherwise be obtained. In the new STAART Centers Program, we will be doing the same kind of thing, where there will be standardized diagnostic protocolsacross all of the sites, standardized instruments, so that then youcan collect genetic data from a large number of subjects distributedat various sites and have the numerical power to do genetic analy-ses that wouldn 't otherwise be possible. We have at NIMH a genetics repository where we collect large amounts of genetic data and make it available to any responsibleinvestigator who applies to us to receive genetic materials from rig-orously diagnosed subjects about whom we have large amounts ofinformation. So this is the future. This is what we are actively implementing. We recently just gave a multimillion dollar grant to the AGRE database, which you may have heard of, which has originated from ad-vocacy groups, and really the grassroots, generating genetic sam-ples. So now we feel like we are in the position where we can havea very large data base of genetic information combined with verydetailed behavioral and clinical information from subjects, so thatwe can do powerful genetic analyses. Then just one final note, and then I will be quiet, because you hit one of my buttons here, obviously. The other issue is that someof these questions that come up, ''Why did my child respond so dra- matically to a particular vaccine when all the other kids on theblock didn 't respond the same way? '' Well, the genetics may well be a clue to that. The way we are going to get the answer eventu-ally is through these combined genetics efforts where we have alarge number of subjects, thorough clinical histories, standardized genetic information, freely available to a number of investigatorswho may well want to look at exactly this question. So that iswhere we are going. We are getting there. Mr. S HAYS . Dr. Boyle. VerDate 11-MAY-2000 I was just going to be very brief. In our centers ' stud- ies, these are epidemiologic studies that are done collaboratively,sort of what we call gene environment interaction. This is a veryimportant issue, and it is clearly one that is the basis for the stud-ies, and that is what we are addressing. Mr. S HAYS . I thank all five of our \u2014\u2014 Mrs. M ORELLA . Mr. Chairman, may I just add something to that? Mr. S HAYS . Sure. Mrs. M ORELLA . That is where you are going to need the passage of the Genetic Non-Discrimination in Employment and Health Act,which has about 260 co-sponsors here on the House side. Mr. S HAYS . I hope I am on that bill. Good grief. Mrs. M ORELLA . I think you are, yes. [Laughter.] Mr. S HAYS . Ms. Watson, do you have any last comments you would like to make? Ms. W ATSON . No, I don 't except to thank the panel. Mr. S HAYS . Yes. I am going to ask this question. I have one other question. Mrs. Morella, any comments?Mrs. M ORELLA . No, Mr. Chairman. Mr. S HAYS . I had a question that I was asked to give, and I think by the response to one that we are doing this. But the questionwas, do the CDC and NIH recommend that the removal of thimero-sal from childhood vaccines \u2014it appears that is the case, that we are removing them from childhood vaccines? Is that the case? Ms. W HARTON . That recommendation was actually made in 1999. Mr. S HAYS . Great. Ms. W HARTON . And the vaccine manufacturers moved very quick- ly to reformulate and relicensed all the routinely administeredchildhood vaccines, so that they are now available only in thimero-sal\u2014they are now marketed only in thimerosal \u2014in formulations that do not contain thimerosal as a preservative. Mr. S HAYS . Got you. Let me ask you this now: Is there any ques- tion that you had prepared to answer that we never thought to askthat you want to answer? [Laughter.] [No response.]Mr. S HAYS . I think that our guests would recognize that you all have been very patient, and I think our witnesses would recognizethat you all, those of us who are our guests at this hearing aredealing with some really tough issues. We want to be helpful to youand want you to stay in touch with our committee. Our committeerecord will be open until the 3rd, and you are invited to submitanything in writing to the committee that you would like to submit. But I do thank all of you for participating here, and I thank No. 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 for being here and your patience in not having thesixth or seventh followup. This hearing is now adjourned. Thank you.[Whereupon, at 5:10 p.m., the committee was adjourned, to re- convene at the call of the Chair.] [The prepared statements of Hon. Thomas M. Davis, Hon. Wm. Lacy Clay, Hon. Christopher H.
