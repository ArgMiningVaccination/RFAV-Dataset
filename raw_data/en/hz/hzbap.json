As you recall, our first hearing on January 18th included an overview of the Department's base budget and key areas of focus for the two upcoming fiscal years. In this second hearing, we will present our proposed budget submission, including revenues and emerging needs. We are requesting Commission approval of these initiatives for submission to the Controller and Mayor's Office. The proposed budget makes key investments for the priorities discussed at the first Health Commission meeting on the FY 2022-24 budget. I. Implementing new programs and benefits under CalAIM II. Transitioning COVID-19 response functions into operations III. Continuing investment in and re-envisioning Behavioral Health Services IV. Strengthening program and department operations to improve service delivery and improving Workforce and Health Equity Without mandatory G eneral Fund reduction targets, DPH will leverage revenue growth to support investments within the department without increasin g its General Fund support. The expenditure plan balances continued implementation of major Citywide strategic priorities for COVID-19 response and expansion of Behavorial Health Services, while also supporting the department's cor e program s and services that remain critical to the health and vibrancy of the City. This balanced approach creates a strong foundation from which the department can continue to respond effectively to current and future challenges and maintain the integrity of the department's core public health programs and healthcare services . This submission represents the first phase of the budget process. Many additional changes are certain in the coming months. Significant interest and attention from the Mayor's Office and Board of Supervisors remains on DPH's Behavioral Health w ork, the implementation of Mental Health SF , and the critical work underway to improve health outcomes in the Tenderloin neighborhood. Similar to last year, behavioral health programs funded under Prop C will be 1updat ed to reflect input from the Our City, Our Home oversight committee which begins its planning process in February. Between now and the final adoption of the budget, DPH will be working with policy makers, community stakeholders and advisory bodies to further develop and refine the initiatives included in this proposal. Similarly, this February proposal around the COVID-19 budget is only a starting point , with what is essentially an initial \"down payment\" toward a final budgetary plan. DPH is still in the process of evaluating the needs and operating model for its COVID -19 related serves and the funding opportunities that may be available through the State and Federal governments. A critical component of this work is to continue developing and strengthening the partnership between the City government and community organizations that has developed during the COVID-19 pandemic, with a goal of integrating COVID-19 programs with broader ongoing efforts to improve health outcomes. I. Base line Revenues Initiatives and CalAIM As in prior years, the department continues to project significant revenue growth to offset proposed expenditures. Most of the revenue growth are related to baseline re imbursement for ambulatory and hospital services. However, new benefits and programs under CalAIM are beginning to come online to offset costs that have historically be supported by the City's G eneral Fund. Initial revenue estimates for programs which will become effective over the next twelve months are included here. A1 - Baseline Revenues for Zuckerberg San Francisco General - This initiative updates the assumptions related to patient revenues at Zuckerberg San Francisco General (ZSFG ). Baseline revenues are projected to increase by $ 50.7 million ongoing. Net General Fund Impact: FY 2022-23 Hospital (LHH) - Laguna Honda Hospital's baseline revenues are based on an estimated 3% increase in Medi -Cal Skilled Nursing Facility Per Diem Rates for FY 2022 -23 and a 2% increase in FY 2023-24 pending final confirm ation from Behavioral Health Revenues - Based on state projections, 2011 Realignment will increase by $ 15.7 million ongoing with an additional $5 million increase in Short -Doyle Medi -Cal for Behavioral Health Services. $19,387,090, Revenues - Backfills losses in Population Health Division for expiring grants as well as a one-time reduction in revenues for Environmental Health Services due to reduced activity during this period of continued economic recovery . Net A5 - Improving Clinical Documentation Integrity - Expands Clinical Documentation Integrity staffing to expand medical record reviews for quality, compliant documentation, subsequent billing, and improved state and federal quality metrics that impact hospital rating and align with healthcare industry best practices. Net General Fund Impact: FY alAIM Programming for Enhanced Care Management, Community Supports and Behavioral Health Quality Improvement Program - This initiative includes revenue changes anticipated under the new California Advancing and Innovating Medi- Cal (CalAIM), the successor program to the current Medi- Cal Waiver. Revenue increases are proje cted for new Enhanced Care Management and Community Supports benefits as well as a one- time Behavioral Health Quality Improvement Program. Net General Fund Impact: FY 2022-23 $4,000,000, FY 2023-24 $4,000,000 II. Integrating COVID -19 Response Functions into Ongoing Operations and Maintaining Community Networks As discussed at the last Health Commission meeting, due to the continually changing nature of the COVID -19 pandemic, the significant planning efforts to incorporate response functions into operations from a stand-alone task force structure, the department's budget submission will not include a detailed proposed spending plan for COVID -19 response. W ith the Mayor's Office permission, we will finalize the development of the budget this spring and will return to the Health Commission for review and approval. Over the next several weeks the department will develop plans for service levels for each of the functions related to COVID -19 response and recovery . As p art of this planning, the department will plan to leverage the extensive community and network engagement infrastructure developed during the pandemic and determine how to continue leverage t hese critical re lationships, not only in response to the COVID -19 pandemic, but to help address broader health disparitie s on an ongoing basis. Recognizing the need to sustain the COVID-19 response and community functions at some level , our budget proposal includes $25 million placeholder to help offset the impact of continued expenditures. Since a more detailed plan will be provided in a future H ealth C ommission meeting , there is no narrative description of this initiative included for this meeting . III. Behavioral Health Services During the FY 2022-24, the department w ill continues to implement and operationalize key aspects of Mental Health SF and expansion of Services for People Experiencing Homelessness under Proposition C funded last year.

These funds will be used to ensure the continuity of existing MHSA programming; s upport new, innovative and culturally congruent services to meet the pressing needs of the Black/African American community and mental health support for birthing people who are Black -Identified. In addition, one- time capital and reserve needs will utilize additional funds in FY 22 -23 to ensure that these MHSA funds are utilized to maximize behavioral health services, and do not revert back to the State if unspent. Net General Fund Impact: FY 2022-23 $0, FY 2023-24 $0 IV. Strengthening Program and Departmental Operations Needs 4Ov er the last several years, DPH has played a central role in major Citywide initiatives including multiple public health emergencies including COVID -19, Tenderloin response and wildfires, as well as complete re-envisioning of the Behavioral Health System of Care. In addition, the department has also internal priorities of implementation of an integrated electronic health record and improving health and workforce equity. Th e department has taken on all these challenges on while maintainin g all the baseline programs under the Population Health Division and the integrated del ivery system services under San Francisco Health Network. The initiatives below invest in key a reas to maintain integrity of the department 's core programs and operations. A. DPH Operations B9 - Human Resources and Health and Workforce Equity - This initiative strengthens DPH's human resources (HR) infrastructure with an additional 20 Full Time Equivalent (FTEs) employees to ensure sufficient support for our workforce and our services. It also adds 5.0 FTEs to advance the department's Racial Equity Pr ogram, including implementation of the SFVoices program. Both of these initiatives were identified as being among the department's top four priorities in its recent annual strategic planning process. - Net General - This initiative adjusts core operating and administrative staffing levels to reflect new program mandates and growth in DPH. It includes 20.5 FTE for the DPH Business Office (including the Contracts Office), 6.0 FTE for Communications, 1.0 FTE for SF Health Network Supply Chain Management, and 1.0 FTE for Security. - Net General Fund Impact: FY 2023-24 ($6,328,306) B. Population Health B11 - Strengthening Population Health Division (PHD) Infrastructure - Lessons learned in the past two years in responding to the pandemic highlighted infrastructure position needs for the Population Health Division. PHD proposes infrastructure changes will assist the division to establish, expand, train and sustain the public health workforce in supporting jurisdictional infectious disease prevention, preparedness, response and recovery initiatives for the City and its r esidents; as well as having the workforce capable of developing and maintaining data visualization, population health data science and epidemiology. Net General Fund Impact: FY 2022-23 ($3,241,790), Health Em ergency Preparedness Response - Public Health Emergency Preparedness and Response (PHEPR) Team is requesting to enhance its capacity to rapidly mobilize, surge and respond to public health emergencies declared at the local, state or national jurisdictions. Additional staff will be added to enhance preparedness and planning efforts, coordination across healthcare systems, communi cations and resilience. Re-entry Services , Buprenorphine Expansion and Quality Improvement at Jail Health -This initiative bolsters Jail Health Services staffing to expand services with the goal of reducing re-incarceration by providing linkages to treatment, supporting medication administration, and improving staff's clinical education. These increases are aimed at expanding discharge planning services to all high needs/risk patients, reducing recidivism and meeting the increased need to expand buprenorphine administration and improve quality of care and documentation within Jail Health Services.

In addition, to address the complex care needs, LHH will add phys icians on nights and weekends to ensure sufficient clinical support. Net General Fund Behavioral Health Response and Safety - Building on a prior year initiative which added a Behavioral Emergency Health Response Team during the day shift, this request expands the service to cover nigh ts and weekends and ensure appropriate response for for patients who exhibit escalating behaviors. In addition, LHH will change its security staffing model by replacing sheriff cadets with Health Worker II staff, who will be better able to respond to incidents and provide security support such as searches and patrol . Net General B19 - Increasing Census and Clinical Support at Zuckerberg San Francisco General - This initiative proposes to fund increased census, clinical support, and standards of care at ZSFG by operationalizing 15 beds in unit H58 with permanent staff in clinical and ancillary services, provide additional UC support for Imaging overnight reads, and 6reo rganize staffing in the Surgical Intensive Care Unit (SICU) towards a centralized model where the SICU goes from a consulting service to the primary service for all surgica l patients requiring ICU level of care.

This program leverages the DPH 340B network and will achieve savings through a new ZSFG Specialty Pharmacy and by developing contracts with external Specialty Pharmacies. Net General Fund Impact: Cardiac Support Devices - This initiative proposes to acquire a new cardiac support device (Impella) and implement a standard cardiac shock treatment at ZSFG to help improve patient outcomes and patient experience for those patients who present with cardiac arrest. This improved patient treatment and support will allow patients that would ordinarily be transferred to other institutions to remain at ZSFG for care , reducing out of network costs. Safety and Security - The proposed change will add needed FTEs to staff the 4 designated entrances at ZSFG: Building 25, Building 5, Building 5 Loading Dock and Building 80/90.

Net General Fund Impact: FY 2022-23 ($1,979,806,) FY 2023-24 ($2,430,293) F. Inflationary Costs and Other Costs Assumed As Part of Citywide Deficit The impact of the following ini tiatives is assumed as p art of the deficit and will not affect the department's general fund target . C1 - DPH Pharmaceuticals and Materials and Supplies Inflation This initiative requests annual inflationary adjustments for expenses critical to network operations. This adjustment is critical to ensuring that DPH can continue to provide services and treatments to its patients. The department projects cost increases of 10% for pharmaceuticals and 9% for food. These proposed increases amount to $10,256,502 for FY 2023-24. Inflationary adjustments were already approved and included in the FY 2022-23 base budget as part of last year 's budget process. C2 - University of California San Francisco (UCSF) Affiliation Agreement Costs : This initiative requests annual adjustments to the long-standing Affil iation Agreement with UCSF for physici an, clinical and ancillary services at Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital Medical Center.

C3 - Office of Managed Care Revenues -This initiative adjusts revenue projections within the Office of Managed Care for Healthy San Francisco (HSF) Participant Fees and 7em ployer contributions for SF City Option program to meet to reflect historical and expected actuals. Net General Fund Impact: FY 2022-23 ($20,530,000), FY 2023-24 ($20,530,000) Balancing Summary After accounting for all initiatives listed above, the proposed budget submission includes $119.8 million in new net revenue over two years and $119.4 million in proposed new expenditures. The remaining balance will be used for any technical corrections needed during system entry. Because the emerging needs are funded with net new revenue, staff believes that these proposals meet the Mayor's Office instruction to propose a budget that does not request additional General Fund support. These proposals represent the department's submission for FY 2022-23 and FY 2023-24. With your approval, we will submit the full proposal presented here to the Mayor and Controller's Office on February 22. We will keep you informed and as necessary schedule any additional hearings as our initiatives are considered for the Mayor's Proposed Budget on June 1.

PHD implements traditional and innovative public health interventions. PHD has an annual budget of $192 million and approximately $58 million from federal, state and private grants. Due to changes in federal a nd state funding priorities, PHD expects a total shortfall of $1,529,197 in revenues in FY 2022 - 2023 and $923,538 in FY 202 3-24 respectively. Additionally, Environmental Health Services (EHS) revenues are projected to decrease by $800,000 in FY2223 due to less activity in licensing and permits primarily for Food establishments . EHS r evenues are projected to recover in FY2324. JUSTIFICATION: Grants are integr al in supplement ing the PHD budget. Without grant awards PHD would not have sufficient funding to support the programs implemented. The requests for backfill of federal, state and other funding reductions for the following PHD Branches includes: The Center for Learning and Innovation (CLI) is PHD's dedicated training and workforce development center and is charged with collaborating with each of the PHD Branches and the DPH's Human Resources staff to meet the department's strategic goals of Develo ping Our People and PHD's priority of developing a Workforce Development Plan, as part of PHD's public health accreditation domain. Thi s request will increase CLI's Director position funded by the general fund by 0.3 FTE to 0.8 FTE from 0.5 FTE. The 0.3 FTE requested is due to reduced funding from Federal Capacity Building Assistance (CBA)grant , UCSF's Preterm Birth Initiative (PtBI) and UCSF -Gladstone Center for AIDS Research (CFAR) grants. The Community Health Equity and Promotion (CHEP) Branch works in conjunction with community members and organizations to develop evidence-based, data- driven, sustainable initiatives to address priority public health issues, with a focus on ensuring health equity. The DPH Ending the Epidemic (ETE) grant and Getting to Zero funded Ward 86 to establish a clinical HIV Prevention Program within the San Francisco Health Network (SFHN), where screening, consultation, coordination, oversight, and support is provided to primary care providers and their patients who are at risk of HIV acquisition. PHD's CHEP and the Disease Prevention and Control Branch have been working closely with Ward 86 Leadership to scale up hospital and in-patient testing and PrEP initiation. The PrEP/Prevention Coordinators are assigned to a) identify HIV negative patients at risk of contracting HIV; b) in consultation with primary medical provider, outreach patients to offer PrEP; c) support initiation of PrEP for new patients; d) provide panel manag ement for patients on PrEP, including supporting regular HIV 20and STD testing and access to PrEP treatment; e) conduct active outreach to patients who are lost to follow up (LTFU). As the CHEP funding (general funds) for 3.83 FTE of the PrEP/Prevention Coordinators and 0.2 FTE RN (for supervision and coordination) ends 6/30/22, the funding request is for a total of $610,875. The annual budget at Ward 86 is approximately $569,070. Ward 86 also requests funds for the Pop Up Program Coordinator, which brings total to: $610,875. The PHD Operations Branch's Grants Management Unit has a full time grant funded 2593 Health Program Coordinator III position that is managing the Epidemiology and Laboratory Capacity (ELC) Grants awarded by the California Department of P ublic Health (CDPH), received in three phases in March 2020 (ELC 1) , August 2020 (ELC 2) and July 20 21 (ELC 3) for a combined total of approximately $36 million. The 2593 grant funded position ends in July 2023. In order to provide program continuity in FY23 -24, the funding request is for $161,507. The position will continue to provide grants coordination, preparation, work plan and spend plan monitoring and other grants project management activities to support the Grants Management Unit's and PHD's goal of seeking additional grants funding stream to continue to reduce reliance on general fund.

JUSTIFICATION: Industry best practices to increase quality of care and re venue opportunities recommends reviewing 100% of patient records, including outpatient reviews. Currently there is only enough nursing and analytical staff in CDI to review 25% of inpatients and 70% of Medicare pat ients which is a major source of revenue for ZSFG. The hospital rating with CMS/Medicare has been 1 star out of 5 for decades. Medic al record documentation is vital to ensuring proper reimbursement , improving quality metrics, ensuring patient safety as well as providing clear clinical history for continuum of care. It is SFDPH's mission to provide the best care possible to our pat ients and that it be docume nted accurately on the legal medical record.

Over the next twelve months, the State will implement three new ongoing benefits and two new infrastructure support programs for counties. JUSTIFICATION: The State of California will continue its multi -year roll out of CalAIM, a new framework that encompasses a broad -based delivery system, program, and payment reform across the Medi- Cal program, with the focus of a whole- perso n care approach. The programs are scheduled developed and implemented through January 2027. Program details including eligibility, funding guidelines and funding allocations are still being developed for most programs. For the FY 2022-23 and FY 2023-24 budget are three new benefits that will be implemented over the next twelve months. Enhanced Care Management - In January 2022, the San Francisco Health Plan (SFHP) and Anthem Blue Cross (BX) i mplemented the first new benefit, Enhanced Care Management (ECM). ECM will be a whole -person, interdisciplinary approach to comprehensive care management that addresses the clinical and non -clinical needs of high-cost, high- need managed care members through systemat ic coordination of services that is community -based, interdisciplinary, high-touch, and person- centered. The proposed budge t assumes SFHN to enroll approximately 400 additio nal clients an d expects to provide enhanced care management services to 550 monthly patients through existing providers in Behavioral Health, Primary Care and Street Medicine Programs for annual revenue of $3.0M. Community Supports (formerly known as In- Lieu o f Services) - Community Supports or CS are medically appropriate and cost -effective alternatives to services covered under the State Plan. Community Supports are optional services for Medi- Cal managed care plans (MCPs) to provide for managed care members. DPH is currently working with the SFHP and BX to implement new benefits for its Medical Respite in January and Sober ing Center Services for July of 2022. Based on tentative rates, SFHN expects to provide 254,300 Med-Respit e days for $1.0 million in annual revenue . Justice -Involved Pre and Post Release Services - The State will begin mandating a county pre- release Medi -Cal application process for incarcerated individuals, allowing Medi -Cal reimbursement for services in the 90-day time period prior to release, and to encourage a facilitated referral and linkage to health services. As t his benefit will not be implemented and January 2023 and program details are not yet available, no revenu e or expense projections are made at this time. To support counties with the transition and implementation of new CalAIM Programs, the State is establishing two programs to provide one time capacity building funds, Providing Access and Transforming Health (PATH) Initiative and Behavioral Health Quality Improvement Plan . The goal of PATH is to provide one-time funding over the course of the CalAIM implementation for the following purposes: 1. Prov ide infrastructure and readiness support for the CalAIM initiatives including the benefits noted above 2. Transition Whole Person Care Programs into CalAIM 3. Support for services for ju stice involved patients Additional details on the first two PATH programs listed above are expected to be released by the end of March. At this time, no timeline for the release of details for Justice Involved Services has been provided. Behavioral Health Quality Improvement Program (BH- QIP) is an incentive payment program to help counties prepare for changes under CalAIM including payment reform, policy changes and increased data exchange. County proposals are due on February 15 th and will fund costs through June 2024. This program provides incentives to County Behavioral Health for meeting specific deliverab les associated with the implementation of CalAIM changes around behavioral health payment and documentation reform . DPH expects to draw $2.1M and $0.9M in FY23 and FY24, respectively in incentive payments to support expenditures needed to meet program milestones. The State's required milestones include contract readiness, system readiness (updating codes and rates), pr ovider training and planning.

A central team comprised of one Manager , one Senior Clerk , and two Data Analysts, which will be responsible for managing MOUs and coordination with local hospitals, managing and implementing required trainings for staff, and data support. There will also be a care coordination and follow- up team staffed by five Behavioral Health Clinicians and one R egistered N urse. This team will be responsible for client- level follow -up, with the goal of providing follow-up for every individual placed on an involuntary hold. They will coordinate discharge plan s with hospitals, coordinate care with existing providers, ensure all individuals who have been placed on a hold have follow- up behavioral health care, and will provide direct field-based support for individuals who are not engaged in care or who need additional outreach-based support to engage in care, with special focus on individuals who have been placed on more than one involuntary hold. This team will be available seven days a week to respond to hospitals for individuals who have been involuntarily detained. Finally, BHS will ex pand existing work around conservatorship to include one additional Behavioral H ealth C linician who will proactively outreach and work with providers to identify individuals at risk for grave disability and support providers with contemplating and initiating conservatorships as indicated. JUSTIFICATION: In FY 2020-21, there w as an estimated 13,000 cases of individuals being placed on an involuntary psychiatric hold across San Francisco. These holds are often referred to as a 5150, which corresponds to the California Code which allows for temporary involuntary psychiatric hold for individuals who present a danger to themselves or others. An estimated 5% of these 28cases have multipl e instances of detentions (four or more) . San Francisco has struggled with timely support, access, and consistent follow-up with individuals on a hold. This was further highlighted in the 2019 LPS State Audit report which found that San Francisco had a high volume of inconsistent and unsuccessful linkages to ongoing care for individuals a hold. IMPACT ON CLIENTS : (units of service and/or number of clients affected , if applicable ) These services will allow for increased and enhanced coordination across San Francisco hospitals to ensure that individuals who are indigent, uninsured, or MediCal recipients are linked to appropriate care within the DPH system. This will also expand the response team to allow for 7 day a week coverage to directly support and link individuals to care prior to discharge from the hospital and provide intensive follow-up when indicated. Finally, for individuals who are unsuccessful served through voluntary services or continue to deteriorate in the community, these services will ensure proactive identification, outreach, and filing for court ordered treatment when indicated.

Additionally, BHS supports the Felton Institute , a non-profit agency that operates the San Francisco Su icide Prevention Hotline, both via contractual funding, and through CCS staff who take over Hotline calls that exceed the capacity of the Hotline staff. In FY21-22 there hav e been significant enhancements to the City's crisis response capacity, with more significant changes expected in FY22 -23. The purpose of this initiative is to seek additional staffing to support the CCS and the Felton Institute to ensure that the City's crisis response is seamless , fully supportive, and effective. A brief description of the initiatives requiring additional staffing and resource support from the CCS and the Felton Institute are as follows: In July, 2022, a nationwide three-digit number, 988, will become available for the first time, with local calls directed to the San Francisco Suicide Prevention Hotline for suicide prevention and mental health crisis response. The implementation of this new service is expected to greatly increase call v olume both directly to the Felton Institute and secondarily to CCS , which will continue to manage the needs of callers with complex clinical needs triaged by the Hotline staff . Funding for the San Francisco Suicide Prevention Hotline will enable the hiring of paid employees versus volunteers to ensure staffing stability and capacity needs are met . Staffing for CCS will allow for triage of the most complex calls. Additionally, CCS anticipates that the increased volume of calls will also result in an increase in CCS field response , as approximately 20 percent of all calls result in a follow -up field response. 31 In FY20- 21, the City implemented multiple Street Crisis Response Teams (S CRT s). A SCRT is a mobile unit that responds to individuals on the street s who are experiencing a behavioral health crisis. Currently, the SCRTs are dispatched by the City's 311 operat ors. An upcoming dispatch change for 311 behavioral health calls is that they will be initially directed to CC S, so that CCS can provide mental health expertise and triage the cases to the most appropriate resource to provide better efficiency and client care. CCS is initiating a pilot in partnership with the City's 911 system, where there will be a clinician located/assigned to assist and triage call s made t o 911 for behavioral health reasons and without a need for emergency responders, such as an ambulance, police or fire. This partnership is intended to decrease the need for police and other emergency response to calls that do not require medical attention, and don't involve someone who has a weapon or is ass aultive. This approach is designed to provide a more trauma informed response to individuals with behavioral health needs. The CCS team has and will continue to respond to family and individual needs following a traumatic event. CCS manages a Bereavement Fund to address imminent and unexpected financial needs, including costs related to funeral/burial service, a s well as funding for relocation/temporary housing due to violence related safety concerns. This fund has become a critic al resource to meet basic needs, while ensur ing stability and safety during and after a traumatic event. The proposed request would allow for a permanent ongoing funding source, with the budget based on historical spending levels. The total proposed staffing to meet the needs identified above includes: four Behavioral Health Clinicians; four Health Workers; two Clinical Supervisors (Sr. Behavioral Health Clinicians) ; and one Health Program Coordinator III, to be the \"988 system coordinator\". This initiative will also expand contractual funding at the SF Suicide Prevention Hotline to be able to staff the 988 crisis-line using non-volunteer staff, and to support the Bereavement Fund at its current usage level , by replacing one- time dollars. JUSTIFICATION: Given the current significant increase in crisis call volume (due to Covid -related mental health distress, worsening suicide and opioid crises, increased recognition of diverting 911 calls from law enforcement to behavioral health specialty resources, and other factors), as well as both upcoming national and local changes to crisis response (need for development of a new pathway to activate SCRT using 311, launch of the national 988 crisis line in July 2022, etc.), there is an urgent need to expand CCS staffing capacity. CCS currently manages a 24-hour crisis line as well as mobile crisis for adults and children. During daytime hours, it is currently staffed full - time, but during nights and weekends c alls are forwarded to on -call clinicians by an answering service. To effectively partner with the City 's 311 and 911 systems, and to support the most complex calls triaged through the new upcoming national 988 crisis line , the CCC Crisis Line needs to be adequately staffed 24 hours a day, seven days a week. CCS also needs sufficient staffing to respond to the expect ed increase in field visit demand . At the same time, the San Francisco Suicide Prevention Hotline requires additional f unding to support the increased 32volume expected via the new 988 system . An additional $450,000 will be added to current Felton Institute's SF Suicide Prevention contract . The CCS team responds to mental health , traumatic events , and deaths faced by families , much of which is related to violence. Part of the support includes cost of burial services and room rentals (to move individuals to a safe environment). CCS has received increased demand for this Fund. As of Jan 2022, Comprehensive Crisis Services has served 97 families, as compared to 96 total families served in the entire FY19 -20. The initiative will allocate an additional $780,000 funding to create an annual program budget of $1.06 million to support anticipated need and maintain service levels . For reference, a maximum per family allocation is set at $16,500. IMPACT ON CLIENTS : (units of service and/or number of clients affected , if applicable ) Across 911, SF Suicide Prevention /988, 311 and CCS, there are approximately 100,000 annual calls related to behavioral health crises in San Francisco. Crisis services are made available to all, regardless of insurance status or residence. Currently, CCS answers 3,000 calls annually, and triaging of complex crisis calls from 311 and 988 could increase CCS call volume to as much as 15,000 crisis calls annually, a five-fold increase based on conservative estimates. Additional calls to CCS are also anticipated to result in additional demand on staffing for field visits (current field visit rate is 20% of calls), supervisors (currently one supervising clinician covering all calls and field visits), overnight coverage (to have in -office call coverage and add a clinician to keep covering phones while other two clinicians in the field without relying on an answering service ), and expansion to full coverage on weekends/holidays. Investing in CCS capacity expansion will support improved crisis response across San Francisco 24/7.

JUSTIFICATION: BHS is facing an increa sed demand for services across outpatient programs. In general, clients seeking this level of care face long wait times . Specifically, t his initiative seeks to address the following challenges: OMI Family Center: Adds a new 1.0 F TE 2932 Senior Behavioral Health clinician to ser ve as an intake coordinator to screen referrals and schedule intake appointments to meet increased client demand. Chinatown North Beach (CTNB): Adds a new 1.0 FTE 2593 Health Program Coordinator III to oversee new Wellness, Socialization and Outreach Teams. This position will expand the clinic's capacity to provide culturally congruent support services for API community. South- East Mission Geriatrics (SEMG): Popula tion of Older Adults has increased in San Francisco and the clinic will add 1.0 FTE 2930 Behavioral Health C linician to increase capacity to serve an additional 50-60 clients. Sunset Mental Health (SSM): Due to high Meds-Only caseloads, psychiatrists need periodic case management support to ensure quality client care. A new 1.0 FTE 2587 Health Worker III will support stable clients on medication to step down to Meds-Only project within clinic. Adult Older Adult (A/OA) System of Care (SOC) Admin: A new 1.0 FTE 1823 Sr. Administrative Analyst to help with analytics, data reporting, building dashboards, and contract planning SOC program managers need support with gathering, analyzing and summarizing data , and contract certification and monitoring 35 IMPACT ON CLIENTS : (units of service and/or number of clients affected , if applicable ) OMI : Increase access to services for clients evidenced by improved access, decreased wait times, client satisfaction, and staff morale.

Additionally, as a treatment system, there is an insufficient level of available family therapy , or knowledge of the techniques of Dialectical Behavioral Therapy , an evidence- based practice to address serious mood dysregulation, such as suicidal ideation. The Department has the following t hree-pronged approach to closing the BHS CYF System of Care's service capacity gaps: (1) The Department will issue a solicitation to obtai n a comprehensive subspecialty treatment center (\"Center of Excellence\") that will be focused on addressing such issues as Eating Disorders, Anxiety/Mood Disorders, ADHD, and Developmental Disorders, while serving as an extension of the current CYF system of care. This Center will become a safety net for BHS children and youth experiencing these challenges, who may otherwise have limited access to this sub-specialty level of care. To ensure success, family therapy will be a critical component of the services provided. It is the intention to offset the proposed annual cost through Federal MediCal reimbursement for eligible services . (2) To coordinate referrals to the new Center, the Department would add a 1.0 FTE 2932 Senior Behavioral Health clinician. Additionally, this clinician would also be responsible for the implementation of a new State and Federal legislative mandate, the Family First Prevention Services Act (FFPSA) Quality Improvement (QI) for youth in need of out-of- home placements. And in support of referral coordination, this initiative would expand contractual funding to coordinate programming needs for high-acuity youth in need of hospital beds. 38(3) Finally, BHS CYF will implement a focused and intensive training effort to expand the knowledge of Dialectical Behavioral Ther apy and other specialized evidence- based practices throughout the delivery system, to ensure that each clinic maintains the same baseline knowledge to respond to client needs using evidence -based practices. JUSTIFICATION: Significant service gaps in the BHS, CYF system of care are negatively affecting the ability of families to access timely services and receive specialized clinical care. As the need for this type of care continues to increase, exacerbated significantly by the pandemic, it is imperative that the Department expand s its safety net and its ability to coordinate linkages to this care . Additionally , the Department is required to meet the requirements of a new Fed/State mandate related to FFPSA QI work for youth in need of out-of- home placements , and in so doing will be able to improve these services as a result. Finally, BHS, CYF providers require training and support in delivering evidence- based practices within an anti -racist lens . Without this critical knowledge and training, service availability will be uneven across the treatment system. IMPACT ON CLIENTS : (units of service and/or number of clients affected , if applicable ) Increased access to specialty care services, with a dedicated linkage resource will help ensure that youth and familie s receive the necessary treatment to specialized behavioral health care. Assuring a standard level of knowledge of evidence- based practices across the treatment system will ensure clients re ceive the same level of service, no matter where they go to seek their care. Finally, in meeting the new State and Federal mandate, the syste m will be more successful in strengthening families, and thereby reducing the number of children that enter foster care. EXPENSE AND REVENUE IMPACT : (for both fiscal years) Expenses will increase by $640K in FY22 -23, offset by $75K in revenues. In FY23 -24 expenses will increase by $1.2M , and be offset by $500K in revenue.

A ctivities of the RSOC Unit will include: 1. Placing clients at the most appropriate level of care to ensure quality of care and improve the flow of cl ients to the least restrictive setting . 2. Working closely with Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital, Laguna Honda Hospital and other SF hospital network, Jail Health, Behavioral Health Services, Ambulatory Care, Department of Homelessness and Supportive Housing, etc. to quickly discharge clients from hospital or jail or other higher level of care. 3. Develop ing new beds and facilities: coordinate the expansion and development of various types of new behavioral health residential programs under M ental Health San Francisco (MHSF) legislation and operationalize newly built and added residential programs. 4. Data analysis and outcomes reporting: design, build, monitor bed availability/tracking system and manage the real -time bed availability . 5. Contract m anagement and vendor relations: oversee and manage relationships and contracts to ensure equitable access, cost effective program design and the highest quality of c are is being provided. Provide ongoing oversight and assessment of budget allocations and utilization data to ensur e the system has an adequate number of beds across all level s of care. JUSTIFICATION: 41BHS residential care and treatment services include a broad range of services including crisis, transitional, and short-term and long- term behavioral health residential treatment; emergency stabilization units/hotels; and behavioral health -focused independent or cooperative living in apartment settings. Currently, BHS does not have adequate staffing resources to effectively oversee such a large and complex system. Further, e xisting programs and contracts are managed by three different programs across DPH and BHS , 1) Transitions, under the SF Health Network, manages long- term care beds (locked sub- acute and board and care facilities) , 2) BHS Adult and Older Adult System of Care manages mental residential treatment beds and housing units, and 3) SUD System of Care manages SUD residential beds. This initiative merges these activities (with exist ing and new staff) under a single unit that will manage all BHS residential treatment and care bed s (+2,100 contracted residential beds and over 400 new beds under MHSF) . The new RSOC Unit will allow for improved coordination and monitoring of these expensive resources . RSOC is also designed to complement other initiatives under MHSF. For example, the RSOC will work closely with the BHS Office of Coordinated Care ( OCC coordinates overall engagement and care management activities ) to improve timely placement in the appropriate level of residential care when needed. RSOC will also support the ability for OCC to improve client flow through the system by facilitating client movement/placement to lower levels of care. IMPACT ON CLIENTS : (units of service and/or number of clients affected , if applicable ) By centralizing and strengthening the oversight of residential care and treatment programs, RSOC will improve access to care and improve outcomes for clients. RSOC will initially focus on residential service for adults and older adult s. In time, RSOC will evaluate how/if the unit should support residential programs for children and youth. Initial priority adult populations for RSOC include 1) c lients discharged from hospitals and jail and 2) clients experiencing homelessness who have mental illness, substan ce use disorder, and/or medical complications. EXPENSE AND REVENUE IMPACT : (for both fiscal years) Increased expenditure of $1.2 million in FY 22 -23 annualizing to $1.6 million in FY 23 -24. IMPACT ON DEPARTMENT'S WORKFORCE : This initiative adds eight new positions (1 Manager IV, 1 Manager I, 1 Health Program Coordinator III, 1 Health Program Coordinator II, 1 Health Care Analyst and 3 Behavioral Health Clinicians).

Pursuant to new and existing state and federal requirements, MHPs are required to operate a utilization management (UM) program that ensures beneficiaries have appropriate access to SMHS. Additional staff are required to comply with new UM regulations and will be placed under BHS' Office of Managed Care. JUSTIFICATION: MHPs are responsible for certifying that claims for all covered SMHS meet federal and state requirements. In 2016, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) issued the Medicaid and CHIP Managed Care Final Rule (2016 Final Rule), which aligns the M edicaid managed care program with other health insurance coverage programs. Currently, BHS has 2.0 FTE 2320 R egistered Nurses and 2.0 2930 Behavioral Health Clinicians supporting UM activities but needs additional staff to comply with new regulations . In a ddition to meeting the State requirements, this increased capacity will improve patient flow and improve access to c are and ensure clients are at the right level of care. New regulations require that decisions to approve, modify, or deny provider requests for authorization shall be communicated to the beneficiary's treating provider within 24 hours of admission of a Medi-Cal beneficiary for psychiatric inpatient hospital se rvices . Almost 9,000 bed days a year must go through this process and represents a vast shift from current practice. To meet the standards, BH S proposes adding 5.0 FTE 2320 Registered Nurses , consistent with best practices, to staff UM operations 7 days a week. Further, new regulations outline similar requirements for utilization management of specialty mental health residential treatment. This level of care can be authorized by licensed social workers. Three additional FTE 2930 Social Workers are needed to comply with new standards. IMPACT ON CLIENTS : (units of service and/or number of clients affected , if applicable ) This initiative will promote access to medically necessary care and will further goals to mo ve clients to lower levels of care whe n appropriate. Utilization management is intended to ensure 44that the services are sufficient in amount, duration, or scope to reasonably achieve their purpose and that services for beneficiaries with ongoing or chronic conditions are authorized in a manner that reflects the beneficiary's ongoing need for such services and supports. They are also designed to ensure the MHPs do not arbitrarily deny or reduce the amount, duration, or scope of a required service solely because of diagnosis, type of illness, or condition of the beneficiary.

Funding comes from a one percent tax on personal income in excess of $1.0 million dollars and as a result it can be volatile and fluctuate from year -to-year. Funding allocated to counties through MHSA is subject to a community planning process, as well as Board of Supervisors approval to ensure the proposed plan meets MHSA requirements. Counties are only allowed to use MHSA revenue to fund programs consistent with their approved local MHSA Integrated Spending Plans. Based on information from the State on prior year actuals, as well as projected increases for the current year and FY 22 -23, the Department is projecting additional revenue of $53,308,338 to occur over the next two years ($35,039,729 in FY22-23 and $18,268,608 in FY23-24). The Department is directing this increased revenue to meet critical behavioral health priorities including ensuring the continuity of existing MHSA programming. The additional funds are also being directed to support new, innovative and culturally congruent services to meet the pressing needs of the Black/African American community and mental health support for birthing people who are Black -Identified. New provisions under state law allow for MHSA funds to support prevention of substance use and overdose so the Department is proposing two new programs to help address the overdose crisis in San Francisco. Further, the proposal will fund one- time capital and reserve needs in FY 22 -23 and will ensure that MHSA funds are used to maximize behavioral health services, and do not revert back to the State if unspent. JUSTIFICATION: The Department is proposing the following two -year spending plan for MHSA funds i n alignment with the San Francisco MHSA Integrated Plan , revenue projections, and meeting the pressing needs to address health equity and the overdose epidemic: 47Initiatives 22-23 23-24 Total Continu $ 10,537,332 $ 21,074,664 Overdose Response Office $ $ 801,784 $960,000 $ 1,761,784 TeleHealth for Birthing People $ 1,400,000 $ 1,400,000 $ 2,800,000 Culturally Congruent and Innovative Practices for Black/African American $ 1,353,332 $ 1,711,870 $ 3,065,202 Program Support Positions $ 795,168 $ 1,005,987 $ 1,801,155 Capital Improvements $ 12,830,000 12,830,000 Reserve 5,226,983 Total $ 35,039,729 $ 18,268,608 $ 53,308,337 Continuing Support for Existing Contracts for MHSA Programs, including Cost of Doing Business Increases $10.5 million will be used to maintain support for existing programs in the current spending plan, while also funding a three percent cost of doing business (CODB) increase, consistent with City contracts funded with G eneral Fund. In addition, MHSA will re duce its assumed salary savings by $2 million to provide sufficient salary and fringe expenditure authority to fill key vacancies. Total Budget: $10,537,332 in FY22-23 and in FY23-24 Creating a DPH Overdose Response Office Under Assembly Bill (AB) 638 and AB 2265 MHSA can now expand funding to support substance use and overdose prevention. As such, MHSA is proposing to (1) provide funding to realign and centralize the Department and C ity's efforts by creating an Overdose Response Office to meet the scale of San Francisco's epidemic by adding an additional 7.0 FTE civil service positions, and (2) expand harm reduction services in high-risk settings (SROs, hotels, shelters) by creating a team of Harm Reduction Liaisons to provide overdose prevention education, recruit and train overdose prevention champions, link to low- barrier treatment and other risk reduction services by adding 11.0 FTE. Total Budget: $2,395,130 in FY22-23 and annualiz e to $2,953,419 in FY23-24 Hope SF The current MHSA Integrated Plan includes programs that provide mental health and wellness promotion to support the City's Hope SF initiative. Hope SF is an initiative that supports people living in public housing by making available mental health and tailored comprehensive and trauma informed services. In collaboration with Hope SF, as part of the City's Dream Keeper Initiative Fatherhood Project, MHSA is proposing to provide $960,000 to this program by providing support for 5.0 new civil service FTEs ($752,633) and $207,367 for programming expenses. Total budget People MHSA is collaborating with MCAH on expanding mental health support for Bla ck-Identified pregnant people living in San Francisco. Approximately 20% of pregnant women are estimated to have a mental health (MH) condition that would benefit from MH support services such as counseling/therapy. Among Black/African American women, thi s percent is higher because of 48the increased stress levels resulting from structural and interpersonal racism. Over the next two years, MHSA will provide $1,400,000 annually to achieve the followings goals: Provide easily accessible, timely, high-quality, culturally -tailored MH care to Black/African American women who are pregnant and/or post-partum; Work with providers to develop and hone a suite of new and innovative approaches to anti-racist perinatal MH care; Programming may include: o Therapeutic and life skills groups to address trauma for youth via music; o Nutrition groups for adults and families via cooking lessons, o Field trips for seniors who are isolated in the community, o Expansion of women's group addressing trauma, single-parenting, domestic violence, and their holistic well-being, and Provide Black/African American people who are pregnant and/or post- partum with timely and appropriate screenings that are seamlessly connected to follow- up care, including COVID vaccinations Expand the workforce of mental health practitioners in San Francisco capable of providing quality, and anti- racist MH care to Black/African American parents Total Budget $1,400,000 in FY22-23 and $1,400,000 in FY23-24 Continue Culturally Congruent and Innovative Practices for Black/African Americans In recognition of disparities in access to behavioral health treatment and outcomes for Black/African Americans , the MHSA Integrated Plan includes a pilot initiative that expands staffing capacity by 10 FTE, or seven Behavioral Health Clinicians (2930), and three Senior Behavioral Health Clinicians (2932) through the use of temporary positions. The proposed initiative would allow the Department to retain the existing capacity by making each of these positions permanent beginning in FY22-23. The permanent staffing would allow BHS to provide culturally responsive behavioral health interventions at four BHS civil service clinics: (South of Market Mental Health, Ocean Merced Ingleside (OMI), Mission Mental Health Alternative Programs, and TAY Civil Service Clinic ). The interventions are State-approved to enable San Francisco to utilize and continue innovative and culturally congruent interventions for the first time with San Francisco' s Black/African American communities. Total Budget $1,353,332 and annualize to $1,711,870 in FY23-24 Increasing MHSA Program Support To support this significant expansion of programming, the initiative proposes the following: 1.0 2591 Health Program Coordinator II/MHSA Program Administrator position to serve as a program administrator to ensure compliance with Mental Health Services Act regulations and reporting. 1.0 FTE 2587 Health Worker III/Vocational Coordinator position w ill serve as a coordinator for MHSA's State mandated vocational services. 1.0 FTE 2586 Health Worker II/ Staff Wellness Support Specialist position to assist with coordination of wellness activities and retreat s for 600 BHS staff. 1.0 FTE 2593 Principal Analyst/Prevention and Early Intervention Services Manager will assist in managing MHSA's prevention and early intervention programs that include 49providing mental health support for vulnerable populations , including coordinating efforts with the Dream Keep er Initiative . 1.0 FTE 1822 Administrative Analyst will support increased budget management and reporting responsibilities due to the growth of MHSA funding in recent years 1.0 FTE 2593 Health Program Coordinator III/Equity Training Manager position will develop racial and health equity trainings for the Department's behavioral health clinicians and community -based organizations. Total Budget: $795,168 in FY22-23 and annualize to $1,005,987 in FY23-24 Capital Improvements Most mental health clinics in San Francisco require some level of capital improvements. The original MHSA Capital Facility Program and Expenditure Plan identified a set of projects specifically to improve four buildings requiring an amount of $12,830,000 in one-time funding from MHSA. The proposed request would provide the necessary funding to complete projects in the following locations: $4 million - Southeast Health Center: conversion of an existing building to relocate specialty mental health services for Southeast Family Therapy Services a specialty mental health clinic Southeast Family Therapy Services $2 million - Hope SF Sunnydale Wellness Center $1 million - 3500 Cesar Chavez - relocation of Sout heast Mission Geriatrics $5 million - Chinatown Child Development Center $250,000 - TAY Clinic (755 So Van Ness) $80,000 - Southeast Child Family Therapy Services $500,000 - Clinical Services including Office -Based Buprenorphine Induction Clinic (OBIC) at 1380 Howard Total Budget: $12,830,000 Prudent Reserve $5,226,983 will be appropriated to cover future costs and/or help offset any future fluctuations in revenues . A prudent reserve is required of all counties under the MHSA authorizing legislation. Prudent reserves are particularly important given the historical volatility of MHSA revenues, which fluctuate significantly with changes in the economy. Additional MHSA Background: Due to the nature of MHSA's funding volatile source, the annual spending plan and the annual appropriated revenues do not match. This is because the revenue projections fluctuate each year, estimates are confirmed via actual tax revenue receipts, and annual projections are revised to reflect actual earnings and therefore counties manage their spending on a multi-year basis. To ensure stable funding for the MHSA Integrated Plan from year to year, all prior year unspent funding, any previously unallocated funding, and/or funding from the Prudent Reserve is specifically designated to ensure budgeted programming may continue without fluctuation. The MHSA three -year program and expenditure plan must be developed and updated through an annual stakeholder process, posted for public comment, and presented in a public hearing with the San Francisco Mental Health Commission (aka Mental Health Board). In San Francisco, the three- year plan is titled the MHSA Integrated Plan, with the current plan covering the years 2020 -2023. . 50 IMPACT ON CLIENTS : (units of service and/or number of clients affected , if applicable) Collectively, the components outlined above will benefit thousands of individual clients. Populations served through this service and staffing enhancements include Black/African Americans, Latinx, API, Native American, transgender individuals, homeless individuals and low-income clients with severe mental illness. EXPENSE AND REVENUE IMPACT : (for both fiscal years) The proposed initiative would increase revenue s and expenditures by $35,339,729 in FY 22-23 and $ 18,568,609 in B8 - Mental Health Services Act for Program Continuity and Expansion to Address Health Equity and Overdose Prevention Description Sources: MHSA Subtotal Sources Uses: Salary and Benefits Operating Expense Subtotal Uses Net General Fund Subsidy Required (savings)/cost (Uses less Sources) Total FTE's New Positions (List positions by Class, Title and FTE) Class Title FTE FTE Culturally Congruent and Innovative Practices Black/African Behavioral Clinician Character/Subobject Code 527000 of Existing Programs 8,537,332 8,537,332 527000 Program Costs for Hope SF Wellness Sites 100,000 100,000 540000 Program Costs for Hope SF Wellness Sites 107,367 107,367 540000 Material & Supplies 300,000 300,000 527000 Professional Services - TeleHealth for Birthing 1,400,000 1,400,000 506000 Programmatic Project - Prudent Reserve 5,011,179 540000 Materials and Supplies - - 560000 Capital 8,077,027 $ 35,086,612 $ $ 2023-24 Program Change Request DIVISION : DPH - department wide San Francisco General Hospital Population Health Laguna Honda Hospital SF Health Network Wide Ambulatory Care _________ PROGRAM / INITIATIVE TITLE: Human Resources, and Health and Workforce Equity TARGETED CLIENTS: DPH Clients and Staff PROGRAM CONTACT NAME/TITLE : Lueanna Ki m - HR Director Ayanna Bennett, MD - Office of Equity FY2022-23 FTE Change FY 202 3-24 Fund Impact Favorable/(Unfavorable) FY 202 3-24 Cumulative General Fund Impact Favorable/(Unfavorable) 25.00 ($3,828, 043) ($4,784,459) PROGRAM DESCRIPTION: (brief d escription of proposed change) This initiative strengthens DPH's human resources (HR) infrastructure with an additional 20 Full Time Equivalent (FTEs) employees to ensure sufficient support for our workforce and our services. It also adds 5.0 FTEs to advance the department's Racial Equi ty Program , including implementation of the SFVoices program . Both of these initiatives were identified as being among the department's top four priorities in its recent annual strategic planning process. The HR initiative emphasizes accelerating hiring t imes, staff retention and improving employee experience. These challenges are currently one of the primary barriers to implementation of key strategic initiatives and restoring core DPH services to full operating capacity. This investment will increase the number of permanent hires and reduce vacancies to support programs with regulatory requirements such as Zuckerberg San Francisco General, Laguna Honda Hospital and Ambulatory Care , as well as make timely, permanent hires and fill critical vacancies in Behavioral Health and other divisions. In addition, it will build administrative infrastructure needed to execute on identified priorities without halting hiring in other DPH divisions. It will also increase retention and improve the work culture. There are not enough HR staff to respond to this increased demand for services which is resulting in the potential for legal liability, frustration, and staff exodus to other City departments and Bay Area health care entities. The investments in Equity program staffing represent the next phase in the ongoing implementation of DPH's racial equity work. Staffing will accelerate implementation of the Racial Equity Action Plan, advance divisional equity initiatives, and work toward reducing disparities in health outcome s. A key component of this work is the SFVoices program, a text and web -based survey instrument that will allow SFDPH to get direct information on the health behavior and needs of residents in neighborhoods of high need. 53JUSTIFICATION: As of FY 2022 -24, DPH has almost budgeted 8,000 full time equivalent budgeted (FTE) employees and currently has 130 HR staff including labor, payroll, operations, equal opportunity and disability accommodation management, workforce development and merit and examinations. This ratio is insufficient to meet the department's operational needs. To meet the needs of our workforce, we propose increases in HR as follows: HR Examinations Team - 1.0 FTE Human Resource Analyst, 4.0 FTE Senior Human Resource Analysts. The Examinations Division supports hiring managers in conducting examinations, recruitment, and classification studies. Staffing deficits in this unit have been identified as a significant factor in hiring delays. The proposed analysts are required to keep HR hiring moving at an adequate pace and to address the growing backlog. DPH has 250 unique classifications with an insufficient number of examinations analysts to conduct them. Unless DPH increases the number of staff, it will not be able to assign and conduct examinations timely which will lead to an inability to fill positions. This inability to fill positions leads to a staff attrition. HR Experience and Culture - 3.0 FTE Human Resource Analysts, 2.0 FTE Senior Human Resource Analysts , 1.0 FTE The Office of Experience and Culture is responsible for radically reinventing and implementing HR systems, processes, and services that serve the end user and align all HR functions into a cohesive whole. This team imbed s equity into decision-making, workflow, policies, and service and advocate for the needs and wants of staff and propel new innovative improvements to transform DPH int o a premier place to work. The office lead s organizational development changes related to workflow, service delivery, culture, and organizational structure. The additional positions are necessary to capture, implement, and communicate improvements to the hiring process. They will also address employee issues before they become grievances and discrimination complaints. HR Workforce Analytics, People Development, and Employee Relations -1.0 FTE Principal Administrative Analyst The Workforce Analytics, People Development, and Employee Relations Division is responsible for collecting, analyzing, and reporting position control information and personnel data within HR, DPH, and other key stakeholders to ensure that HR is supporting DPH's strategic goal and vision. They design and implement professional development programs, and support DPH employees who are experiencing workplace conflict and/or are in need of career coaching, and connection to resources. DPH HR has struggled with collecting and managing position control information. This position will build and supervise the team. Civil Rights, Leaves, Workers Compensation - 3.0 FTE Human Resource Analysts, 2.0 Senior Personnel Clerk The Civil Rights, Leaves, and Workers' Compensation Division is responsible for conducting investigations into alle gations of discrimination. The division also manages leaves of absence and workers' compensation claims. In the past several years, DPH has experienced an increase in the number of discrimination complaints and requests for leaves of absence. Workers' compensation costs have also risen significantly due t o the inability to a ddress ergonomic 54requests . Currently each human resources analyst in the leaves of absence unit is responsible for 1,000 leaves per year. This is an unsustainable number of cases. Failure to adequately staff this unit will result in legal liability and high rates of employees who are off work, contributing to staffing shortages and increased hiring needs. Workplace Safety and Health - 1.0 FTE Safety Officer, 1.0 Senior Clerk The Workplace Safety and Health Division is responsible for ensuring compliance with workplace (occupational) health and safety laws, regulations (Cal OSHA), and rules. In order to meet the mandates, they need to have administrative support and sufficient safety officers to monitor and respond to health and safety complaints. In addition to growth in total DPH staffing, the COVID -19 pandemic has led to new regulatory requirements and staff demand for services provided by this division. Health Equity Program Staffing - 2.0 Health Program Coordinator III, 1.0 Senior H ealth Program Planner, 1.0 Senior Administrative Analyst, 1.0 Registered Nurse, 1.0 Manager II. The Office of Health Equity has set a goal for all DPH divisions to have dedicated staffing to advance racial equity initiatives. These positions will provide divisional focus on implementation while coordinating on the department -wide vision led by the Office of Health Equity. This initiative will add staffing in Primary Care, DPH Operations, Whole Person Integrated Care, and Jail Health . The initiative also includes staffing for the SFVoices program. As part of our commitment to equity, SFDPH is building greater capacity to hear from the community and integrate this feedback into programs. SFVoices is a text and web -based survey instrument t hat will allow SFDPH to get direct information on the health behavior and needs of residents in neighborhoods of high need. The project will require: a contracted platform to manage the surveys and data collection; management oversight to organize the program ; communications and materials to advertise the program ; data analytic support ; and staff to recruit community participants This program has many use cases across the department from patient input on clinic policy changes, community input on the location of services and detailed information on which services community members need and which they are aware of but have not used. IMPACT ON CLIENTS : (units of service and/or number of clients affected , if applicable) The investments will ensure that both clinical and non -clinical operations department wide are adequately supported within HR, to minimize hiring delays, retain current staff, and create a support system for supervisors and managers. It will increase the department's ability to gather data needed to develop programs and initiatives to address health disparities and improve health outcomes for residents in neighborhoods of high need. EXPENSE AND REVENUE IMPACT : (for both fiscal years) Expenses will increase by 3$.8M in FY2223 and by $4,8M in FY2324 IMPACT ON DEPARTMENT'S WORKFORCE : Annual increase of 2 5 FTE. 55INITIATIVE TITLE: B9 - Human Resources, and Health and Workforce Equity Description Sources: Subtotal Sources Uses: Salary and Benefits Operating Expense Subtotal Uses Net General Fund Subsidy Required (savings)/cost (Uses less Sources) Total FTE's New Positions (List positions by Class, Title and FTE) Class Title Analyst Character/Subobject Code 527000 Professional Services 75,000 75,000 540000 Materials and Supplies 50,000 50,000 581000 Workorder - - 125,000 $ 125,000 $ - $ FY 2022-23 FY 2023-24 - $ 3,703,043 $ 125,000 $ 125,000 $ - $ 4,659,459 $ - $ 25.003,828,043 $ 3,828,043 $ M/Budget/FY 12-14/B9 - FY 22-24 Human Resources, and Health and Workforce Equity 56 Initiative Number - B10 FY 2022-23 & 2023-24 Program Change Request DIVISION : DPH - department wide San Francisco General Hospital Population Health Laguna Honda Hospital SF Health Network Wide Ambulatory Care _________ PROGRAM / INITIATIVE TITLE: Investment in DPH Operations TARGETED CLIENTS: PROGRAM CONTACT NAME/TITLE: Greg Wagner, Chief Operations Officer FY2022-23 Change FY 202 3-24 Fund Impact Favorable/(Unfavorable) ($5,170,250) ($6,328,306) PROGRAM DESCRIPTION: (brief d escription of proposed change) This initiative adjusts core operating and administrative staffing levels to reflect new program mandates and growth in DPH. It includes 20.5 FTE for the DPH Business Office (including the Contracts Office), 6.0 FTE for Communications, 1.0 FTE for SF Health Network Supply Chain Management, and 1.0 FTE for Security. JUSTIFICATION: Over the last two years and in the proposed budget for FY 22 -24, DPH is assuming new programmatic responsibilities and experienced significant budgetary growth . These additional efforts include the implementation of Mental Health S F and expansion of the Behavioral Health System, added operational responsibilities caused by the COVID -19 pandemic, the Mayor's Dreamkeeper Initiative , and implementation of changes associated with CalAIM, among others. Operational and administrative capacity within DPH has failed to keep pace with these changes, and in many cases the department is struggling to implement these critical initiatives on s chedule and to keep pace with the core operating needs of the San Francisco Health Network and Public Health Division . While the FY 21 -23 budget included some additional resources for these functions, an internal department review identified staffing augme ntations in certain areas as a critical need to effectively implement DPH's top priorities. In addition to investment in human resources (described in a separate initiative), DPH staff propose the following: DPH Business Office - 20.5 FTE The DPH Business Office plays a key role in implementing and sustaining new initiatives particularly those involving contracted services and community based organizations. Demand for new and expanded contracted services has grown significantly due to Mental Health SF, COVI D-19, the Dreamkeeper Initiative, and other priorities. The proposed initiative includes: 11.0 FTE (0932 Manager IV partially funded from existing 0931 Manager III; 2.0 0923 Manager II; Senior Analyst; 1822 Administrative Anal yst) staff for the DPH Contracts Office . This office is 57responsible for developing new contracts and solicitations. The initiative would make permanent 4 .0 FTE added as temporary positions in prior year budgets and add 7.0 new FTE. These increases are needed to keep pace with demand for new contracts, competitive solicitations, and contract modifications and amendments. 3.0 FTE (2.0 1824 Principal Administrative Analyst, 1823 Senior Administrative Analyst) for the Budget Unit, which performs financial management functions for the Behav ioral Health Division. This additional staffing is required to manage the additional budget and contra ct requirements associ ated with Behavioral Health expansion. 1.0 FTE ( 0922 Manger I replacing an existing 1824 Principal Administrative Analyst, 2593 Health Program Coordinator III) for the Office of Contract Development and Tech nical Assistance (CDTA). CDTA is the principal point of contact to health service providers.

This additional staffing is needed due to the expanded volume and size of contracts. 2.0 FTE (2593 Health Program Coordinator III) for the Business Office of Contract Compliance, which is responsible for determining contract agency compli ance with its performance objectives and other requirements. This additional staffing is needed due to the expanded volume and size of contracts. 0.5 FTE (1827 Administrative Services Manager ) for Facilities, to assist in managing new MHSF sites and administrative facilities for new staff. 3.0 FTE (1825 Principal Administrative Analyst II, 1824 Principal Administrative Analyst, 1822 Administrative Analyst) to develop, implement, and manage a new electronic contracting management system. This new system will streamline contract approvals, development and management by developing and automating workflows and data management for contracts. Communications - 6.0 FTE (0923 Manager II; 5.0 1314 Public Relations Officer) The Communications Division has experienced dramatic growth in workload over the past year, including continuing high demand from the public, community organizations and press for information re lated to COVID -19, Mental Health SF and other core departmental work. Public Records Act requests have increased significantly in volume. The Communications Division has always functioned with a very small number of staff. During the early months of the pandemic, this work was supplemented by deployed staff from other City departments. With the de-deployment of staff from other City departments and the transition of COVID-19 functions back to DPH operations, the Communications Division require s additional staffing to provide timely responses to information requests from the public. Supply Chain -1.0 FTE (0941 Manager VI). Since the onset of COVID-19 and other expansions of San Francisco Health Network's functions, DPH has taken on additional departmental and citywide responsibilities for purchasing, management and distribution of supplies. These include personal protective equipment, vaccines and other supplies. DPH is moving toward increased integration of purchasing and supply chain management functions across the network and Public Health Division. This new position will be responsible for developing policies, systems, and operations to support DPH and its partners. 58Security - 1.0 FTE (7262 Maintenance Planner). The Security Division has relied on a temporary project -funded position to manage electronic and physical security systems for the past several years.

Currently there is ins uffici ent discharge support for patients exiting jail, which averages about 30 individuals per day most of which are released with only a few hours' notice. The se increases are aimed at expanding discharge planning services to all high needs /risk patients , reducing recidivism and m eeting the increased need to expan d buprenorphi ne admin istration and improve quality of care and documentation at JHS. In addition to im proving the health outcomes, t hese investments will also position the depart ment to provide ne w pre -release and p ost serv ices expected under CalAIM. JUSTIFICATION: JHS proposes an additional annualized 8 FTEs across these three areas to meet the needs of our patients and workforce. The FTEs will be allocated as foll ows: Re-entry D ischarge Planning - 4 FTE 2587 Health Worker III and 1 FTE 2932 Behavioral Health Clinician . With current sta ffing levels, JHS can only manage re -entry services for pa tients who are participants in a collaborative court, incompetent to stand trial on a misdemeanor , mental health diversion and/or presenting with a very high- risk situation . This represents only a fraction of patients and is not inclu sive of the population fo r who m CalAIM manda tes discharge planning services . Furthermore, t he lack of discharge planning services for incarcerated individuals is a significant contr ibuting factor to our high rates of recidivism. JHS will add 4 health work ers to a Reentry team that in cludes 1 Health Program Coordinator, 4 Behav ioral Health Cl inicia ns, 2 health workers and 4 grant-funded positions. These new health workers will offer discharge planning services to every patient discharging from jail. The level of service will ra nge from basic to robust including linkage to on-demand services, co mmunity resource information, referral s to public entitlement enrollment specialists , transportation, coordinated entry asse ssments information and linkage, pla cement in isolation and quarantine hotels, and facilitat ing referr als and linkage to res idential behavioral health tr eatment, intensi ve 70case management and othe r needed resources. Medication A dministration Support - 2 FTE 2312 Licensed Vocational Nurse. The ex pansion of psychiatry staffin g and changes in buprenorphine prescribing practices in the jails has signi ficantly increased the burden of medication administration. The time it takes to complete each pill call has increased by thirty percent. Year over year, JH S has increased i ts buprenorphine administrat ion alone in the jail by 120% and curre nt staffing is not able to meet this increased demand . Without additional staff, JHS will be unable to continue initiating new low barrier bup renorphine s tarts in the jails . In additio n to supporting medication administration, these positions will also support vaccinations , including covid va ccines . Clinical Education - 1 FTE 2320 Registered Nurse . With the implementation of EP IC at the J ails has made ap parent the need for a dedicated clinical staff to focus on the continued education of our workforce . In additio n, with the expected increase in reporti ng, data analysis and outcomes tracking, and potent ial claiming under CalAIM, the lack of infrastructure for clinical education in our rapidly changing healthcar e environment has emerged as a significant ris k. To addres s these issues, this position will be responsible for onboarding new staff and continued professional development. This position will also join the JHS Quality Improvement (Q I) team and act as the clinical subject matter expe rt on population health equit y. IMPACT ON CLIENT S: (units of service and/or number of clients af fected , if applicable ) The in vestment will allow for J HS to meet the needs of our cli ents while under o ur care and prepare them adequately for release to the communi ty.

To expand capacity at both locations, this initiative adds 4.0 FTE dedicated to HRC and 2.0 FTE to dental services at the Southeast clinic. JUSTIFICATION: MXM Health Resource Center - 1 FTE 2210 Dentist, 2 FTE 2202 Dental A ide, and FTE 1406 Senior Clerk . The MXM H RC will open this summer at 555 Stevenson St, with dental services and other collocated clinical services relocating from our existing c linic at 50 Ivy St. This new site will include 2 additional dental chairs to expand dental services for the clinic's population of focus , which is people experiencing homeless ness. The expansion is projected to generate an estimated 4,000 additional visits annually. To support this planned expa nsion and optimized use of the facility , SFHN Primary Care requests a dentist and the two dental aides to staff the additional two chairs at the HRC . The senior c lerk will manage the front office dental scheduling , help facilitate access to care for people experiencing homelessness, and perform other administrative dutie s. Southeast Health Center - 2 FTE 2202 Dental Aide. The additional dental aides will manage the front office dental scheduling and perform other administrative and operational duties for the dental teams . These tasks are currently being handled by existing dental aides , who must split their time between front desk and back office clinical duties, leading to gaps in service. Having a staff member dedicated to thes e duties, with the possibility of them serving dental patients when needed, will increase the capacity of the dental clinic as well as i mprove the quality of care. IMPACT ON CLIENTS : (units of service and/or number of clients affected , if applicable ) The investment will expand dental services at HRC by 4,000 additional patient visits. It will also improve service delivery, efficiency, and access to care at Southeast Health Center's dental clinic by providing additional front office support . 73EXPENSE AND REVENUE IMPACT : (for both fiscal years) Increase of expenditures of $ $731,363 in FY 202 2-23 with a corresponding increase in revenue for net general fund impact of $0.

As part of the current 2320 MOU, HAH recently negotiated a new productivity standard with the HAH Nurses, where they will now produce approximately 700 less visits per year, approximately 134 less admissions per year and approximately $94,000 in lost revenue. By adding 2 LVNs, we will be able to replace those lost visits with additional 600 visits and recover $240,000 in revenue. JUSTIFICATION: During negotiations, the nurses were able to demonstrate that the current productivity standard required them to routinely work over their 1.0 FT in order to get all of their assigned tasks done. Under the negotiated new productivity standard, our number of completed visits, number of unique patients and revenue goes down substantially. By adding 2 LVNs to the HAH roster, all of these metrics are preserved, and the RNs can complete their tasks within the time provided. IMPACT ON CLIENTS : (units of service and/or number of clients affected , if applicable) The net impact of this change is that HAH can actually increase its cen sus to over 200 while also adhering to the new productivity standard negotiated in good faith with the nursing union, so by enacting this change, patients will have better access to this vital service. EXPENS E AND REVENUE IMPACT : (for both fiscal years) Increas es in expenditure by $223,071 in year one and by $282,660 ongoing.

R acial disparit ies are particularly acute in the African American (AA) and Pacific Islander (PI) communities, with both communities experiencing the highest rates of adverse maternal outcomes and infant mortality. MCAH has a two -pronged approach to meet the needs of these two communities through its MCAH Perinatal Equity I nitiative (PEI) and Public Health Nursing (PHN) program. Both target severe health disparities for low-income women, with the PEI program focused particularly on pregnant Black African American (BAA) and Pacific Islander (PI) women , infants and young families. The PHN program is composed of public health nurses who conduct regular home visit s, working with families to improve maternal health and ensure positive birth outcomes for both mother and infant . The pro posed initiative would fund a permanent PEI Program Coordinator, and support two additional Public H ealth N urse positions to meet capacity needs. JUSTIFICATION: Over 100 San Francisco families of birthing age are currently on a waiting list to receive PHN home visiting services, critical to improving positive birth outcomes and general maternal and infant health . The proposed addition of t wo additional PHNs would substantially reduce the waiting list, thereby decreasing San Francisco's rate of poor maternal outcome , and the r isk of infant mortality. The PEI Program Coordinator is currently funded by a California Department of Public Health (CDPH) grant that is expected to end June 30, 2023. Maintaining th is 2593 PEI Coordinator position is critical to the success of this program. Together, these two programs are critical in redressing the City's long-standing health disparities experienced by San Franc isco's most vulnerable populations. IMPACT ON CLIENTS : (units of service and/or number of clients affected , if applicable ) Over 100 low -income families , among the most vulnerable populations in San Francisco, will experience a reduction in adverse maternal and infant health outcomes. 78 EXPENSE AND REVENUE IMPACT : (for both fiscal years) Expenditure increase of $425,532 in FY 202 2-23 offset by MCAH TXIX matching funds of $214,051 totaling $(211,481).

The Care Coordination team includes the Patient F low, Utilization Management , and Social Services divisions and is responsible for the admi ssion, care coordination , and discharge of residents. The Medical Services team provides primary care to residents and responds to urgenc ies and emergencies. The curren t staffing model s for these divisions are not a dequate to support a 24/7 operation, which has led to increased wait times, inconsistencies in care, and gaps in service. The Care Coordination team requests one RN for patient flow , three RNs for Uti lizati on Manag ement, and one analyst. These positions will support night and weekend admissions and discharges and improve care coor dination and reporting processes. The Medical Services team requests two permanent ex empt physicians to cover night and weekend shif ts. These shifts are currently staffed by an as-needed pool of physicians, whi ch does not provide the consistency and continuity of care needed by residents and clinical staff. JUSTIFICATION: Care Coordination: Laguna Honda has a key ro le in maximiz ing bed capacity within the San Francisco Health Network. This includes supporting ZSFG's efforts to expedite discharge of patients no longer meeting acute criteria. The additional staffing requested will support the reorganization of our Care Coordination De partment. The se resources will be dedicated to improving the flow of admissions by decreasing wait times associated with referral decisions prior to admission into LHH. The additional staff will also facilitate concurrent level of care reviews which wi ll impr ove the timeliness of discharge planning and coordination. They will also support seven-day-per- week discharges which will impr ove our discharge efficiency by 20%. These resources will also assist in identifyi ng barriers to discharge and implementin g countermeasures for minimizing or eliminating discharge obstacles. This request is critical to our goal of implementing a proactiv e approach in increasing community outreach for services and ultimately exp anding our options for potential discharge. Medical Services: P hysicians working night and weekend shifts respond to a variety of urgent and emergent resident medical problems, and the level of care is often complex. Physicians may also be required to transfer patients to acute care at ou tside faci lities or within LHH. Having a core presence of physicians on all sh ifts is critical t o providing seamless care for LHH residents. The continuity of care that permanent physicians will provide will benefit staff and residents and improve medical staff operations by red ucing staffing gaps and burnout of daytime staff. 81IMPACT ON CLIENTS : (units of service and/or number of clients af fected , if applicable ) Improve continuity of care for all residents and increase the efficienc y of admissions and discharge processes. EXPENSE AND REVENUE IMPACT : (for both fiscal years) Increase in exp enditures by $ 1,531,791 in year one and by $ 1,933,164 ongoing. The cost for the Medical Services team could be parti ally offset by temp and premium pay savings. IMPACT ON DE PARTMENT'S WORKFORCE : The reorgani zation of these d ivisions and addition of staff to provide 24/7 coverage will help LHH improve i ts standard of care and reduce ineffi ciencies, backlogs , and staff burnout. Reducing dependencies on temp and as -needed sta ff will also help build a more cohesive team.

In addition, LHH will change its security staffing model by replacing S heriff Cadets with health workers , who will be better able to respond to incidents and provide security support such as searc hes and patrol. JUSTIFICATION: Laguna Honda Hospital's BERT was formed to support the increased need for skilled behavioral health care providers at LHH and was modeled after a similar program at ZSFG . LHH has seen increase in residents requiring behavioral health care in recent years. The B ERT team is trained to respond to incidents and provides training and guidance to nursing staff for residents who exhibit challenging, aggressive, or escalating behaviors. T he BERT team w orks in collaboration with the Sheriff's Office who provide security support to the team. When not responding to behavioral events, the team will provide training and support for nursing staff. The BRT team onboarded its first three dedicated staff members in FY22 (2 RN and 1 Psychiatric Technician) to cover the day shift, and requests four additional staff in FY23 (1 RN and 3 Psychiatric Technician) to provide coverage during night and weekend shifts. Laguna Honda also requests a reduction in the She riff work order to replace 16 cadets with 14 permanent Health Worker II staff, who will be better able to respond to incidents and provide security support such as searches and patrol.

JUSTIFICATION: Census - Unit H58 ZSFG ran an average of 30 patients above budgeted census before the COVID -19 pandemic began . Even with efforts to maintain significant capacity throughout the last two years , ZSFG reg ularly opened the overflow H58 unit to accommodate patients. This unit has never had dedicated budgeted staff. In FY18, DPH created a census project which appropriated expenditure authority for increased costs offset by corresponding increases in revenue. This project, however, did not create posit ion author ity necessary to staff for the inc reased census. With no foreseeable change to the augmented census at ZSFG, DPH proposes to convert the project authority to operating expenditures with permanent position authority as follow s: The H58 Medical/Surgical unit will be staffed for 1 5 beds to be opened according to ZSFG surge policy. The patient to nursing ratio requirements set through the R N SEIU MOU dictates the minimum staffing for the budgeted beds. This will add 18 RN FTE supported by 8 PCA (Pat ient Care Assista nt) FTE . Budgeting for the 15 bed s will imp rove patient flow from the Intensive Care units, Post Anesthesia Care unit, and the Eme rgency Department within the hospital and ensure that patients are receiving the most appropriate l evel of care. Ancillary staff will be added to maintain the additional space, see to patient needs, and efficiently prepare and turn around beds. The additional staffing also requires the budgeting of supervisory staff . 4.5 FTE of Porters will be added for maintenance of the additional space, cleaning, and bed turnover. 2 FTE of Food Service Workers will be added to enable food deli very to inpatients in the H58 unit. 1 FTE Chef will be added to meet demands of increased inpatient census. 2 FTE Storekeepers will be added to meet the demands o f material s and supply inventory and delivery to appropriate hospital locati ons. The organizational structure of the Diet ary program at the hospital will be updated to inc lude a Dietary manager to supervise the Dieticians as this group curren tly lacks a man ager. Two additional FTE of Dieticians will be added to meet needs of the inpatient populat ion and to 86provide weeke nd dietician staff cove rage. The UC Medical Services Purple Team will support provider needs for H58. Thi s team i s an extension of the core Faculty Inpatient Ser vice and will now accommodate needs of the increased census. This team consist s of approximately 2.5 FTE physicians for 24/7 care. To support the opening of H58 and the ongoing need for materials and supplies, $250,000 will be budge ted each year . Radiology Radiology is currently unable to support attendings overnight read as they support the needs of the department during the day; therefore, the model deployed for supporting overnight imaging has 2nd year and 1 st year residents perform preliminary rea ds with the overread being per formed by an Attending (Board Certified Radiologist) the following day. Often, the overread s from the Attending will result in patient s needing to return if they have already been discharged and/or an alteration to their presc ribed remedy . The unfortunate result of this model has led to missed diagnoses, patient harm and a recent multi- million -dollar settlement. It is ripe for a change to mitiga te the harm to patients. Par ticularly in th e ED , the vulnerable population are at ex treme risk for a negative outcome primarily because once they are discharged , it is very difficult to contact them to return to the hospital. Approximately, 730 patients annually are exposed to this risk in which a discrepancy is found in the overread and 39 pat ients annually are shown to have significant discrep ancy within the vulnerable population that could lead to harm and a negative outcome. The funding re quested would employ radiologists (Attendings) albei t through a Nighthawk service (contracted ser vice) or hiring of additional radiologists to support overnight reads , which would signif icantly improve the care and mitigate risks to the patient and the institution. Surgical ICU Finally, ZSFG proposes to reorganiz e staffin g towards a centralized model where the SICU goes from a consulting service to the primary servic e for all surgical patients requiring ICU level of care . These patients are currently being cared for by general or trauma surgery servic es. Implementing this model wil l require in creasing physician staffing to provide continuous direct care by a senior level ICU provider. s In the Surgical In tensive Care Unit ( SICU , the day shift physician staffing model includes an Attending, F ellow , Nur se Practitioner, residents, and interns. Conversely, the curren t SICU night shift physician staffing model only allows for one resident to cover the entire service and admit new patients to the ICU overnight. Under current nighttime staffing levels, SICU fellows and attendings supervise the overnight resident from hom e (home- call) and t he SICU service acts as a consulting team for surgical patients requiring ICU level of care ( mostly trauma patients). The reorganized staffing model with an additional senior level ICU pro vider would: Allow in -house attending or fellow nighttime coverage which is the standard of care for tertiary level critical care units across the country. Update the current ICU model as the exis ting model is increasingly outdated; most academic and non -academic institutions across the country are mo ving toward a centralized high intensity staffing model. Improve f ragmented communication between ph ysician teams and avoid delays in care for critically ill patients overseen by residents covering med -surge and ICU. Allow for 24/7 progr ession of care, red ucing negative outcomes such as increased Length of Stay (LOS) i n the ICU. Reduce risk of Accred ited Council for Graduate Medical Edu cation (A CGME) work hour violations placing the ACGME program in jeopardy. 87IMPACT ON CLIENTS : (units of service and/or number of clients af fected , if applicable ) This initiative will allow ZSFG to improve client access to quality inpatient s ervic es. EXPENSE AND REVENUE IMPACT : (for bo th fiscal years) The operating budget will increase by $8,419,926 in FY22 -23 and an nualize to $10,056,655 in FY23 -24. These costs are offset by de-appropriation of the census project . The offset $6,600,000 in FY223 will be ong oing. IMPACT ON DEPARTMENT'S WORKFORCE : The increase of 31.21 FTE in FY2223 and 39.5 in FY2324 will increase the number of permanent hires and decrease use of per di em, temporary, and re gistry staffing. 88INITIATIVE TITLE: B19 Increasing Census and Clinical Support at Zuckerberg San Francisco General Description Sources: Subtotal Sources Uses: Salary and Benefits Operating Expense De-appropriation of Census Project Continuing Fund Subtotal Uses Net General Fund Subsidy Required (savings)/cost (Uses less Sources) Total FTE's New Positions (List positions by Class, Title and FTE) Class Title FTE FTE 2320 Registered 250,000 250,000 581000 Workorder $ 2,508,240 (6,600,000) $ 2,508,240 $ - $ 7,548,415 $ - $ $ $ M/Budget/FY 12-14/B19 FY 22-24 Increasing Census and Clinical Support San Francisco General 89Initiative Number - B20 FY 2022- & 20 23- 24 Program Change Request DIVISIO N: X D PH - department wide San Francisco General Hospital Population Health Laguna Honda Hospital SF Health Network Wide Ambulatory Care _________ PROGRAM / INITIATIVE TITLE: Specialty Pharmacy Program Expansion TARGETED CLIENTS: Patients PROGRAM CONTACT NAME/TITLE : David Woods/Chief Pharmacy Officer Fund Impact Favorable/(Unfavorable) FY 202 3-24 Cumulative Net General Fund Impact Favorable/(Unfavorable) 5.00 (5,950,759) 1,608,189 PROGRAM DESCRIPTION: (b rief d escription of proposed change ) This initiative develops a specialty Pharmacy Program at ZSFG for DPH patients taking high cost, complex, specialty medications that require comprehensive pharmaceutical care. This program leverages the DPH 340B network and will achieve savings through a new ZSFG Specialty Pharmacy and by developing contracts with external Specialty Pharmacies. JUSTIFICATION: This initiative will improve patient care and clinical outcomes for DPH patients with complex chronic conditions and/or rare diseases. Specialt y medications account for approximately 75% of the prescription drugs currently in development. In 2022, more than 60% of the drugs expected to gain FDA approval will be specialty medications. This dominant shift toward specialized therapies has put a spotlight on specialty pharmacies to help meet this demand by providing patients the support they need to ensure adherence and outcomes. The DPH i s in the unique position of being able to provide improved care and service to patients in a manner which does not drain scarce resources. Specialty Pharmacy medications are very costly ($1000+/month/patient), r equire insurance authorization, and involve a high degree of patient management due to significant side effect or risk profiles. Disease states treated can range from psychiatric illness,addiction, cancer, multiple sclerosis to rare genetic conditions. The medications required are difficult to obtain due to limited distribution and/or other unique requirements, which makes it challenging for retail pharmacies to handle and distribute these medications . The ZSFG Pharmacy Department will recruit expert p harmacists who will educate patients, provide compliance monitoring, and discuss therapy- related issues with patients. Trained specialty technicians will work with ZSFG clinics to obtain insurance authorization in a timely manner to avoid medication delays. This initiative also includes contracting with ex ternal Specialty Pharmacies. Two significant major pharmacy end of life equipment replacement projects coincide with this initiativethat requires facilities funding for implementation costs. The curre nt automated dispensing cabinets located throughout DPH require improved seismic restraints to comply with OSHPD. The ZSFG inpatient pharmacy carousel will reach end of life soon and pre -work is needed to accurately scope the replacement of this essential piece of equipment. IMPACT ON CLIENTS : (units of service and/or number of clients affected , if applicable ) Improve d patient care for DPH patients with complex chronic conditions and/or rare diseases. Each year, more than 3,000 specialty medicat ion prescriptions are filled at outside pharmacies. The automated dispensing cabinets impact patients throughout the ZSFG campus and at LHH. The carousel impacts all patients at ZSFG. 90 EXPENSE AND REVENUE IMPACT : (for both fiscal years) The operating budget will increase to $20,200,759 in FY22 -23 and annualize to $12,641,811 in FY23-24. These costs will be offset by $14,250,000 revenues in the first year and $ 14,250,000 in the second year. IMPACT ON DEPARTMENT'S WORKFORCE : The increase of 3.08 FTE in BY and 5.0 FTE in BY+1 will increase the number of permanent hires in the department. 91 Initiative Number - B2 1 FY 2022-23 & 202 3-24 Program Change Request DIVISION : DPH - department wide San Francisco General Hospital Population Health Laguna Honda Hospital SF Health Network Wide Ambulatory Care _________ PROGRAM / INITIATIVE TITLE: Implementing Impella Caridiac Support Devices TARGETED CLIENTS: ZSFG Patients PROGRAM CONTACT NAME/TITLE : Patty Coggan , Nursing Director, Surgical and P rocedural Services ; Daisy Aguallo, Director Supply Chain FY2022-23 FY 202 Fund Impact Favorable/(Unfavorable) 3-24 $1,682,951 of proposed change ) This initiative p roposes to a cquire a new cardi ac support device (Impella ) and implement a standard cardiac shock treatment at ZSFG to help improve patien t outcomes and patient expe rience for those patients who present with cardiac arrest . JUSTIFICATION: Despite significant advances in cardiovascular care over the last seventy years, mortality rates in cardiogenic shock remain high. However, in the last several years , devices such a s Impella when combined with a standard treatment p lan have demo nstrated significant promise in impro ving patient outcomes and patient experiences . As the only level 1 trauma center and the hospital with the highest ambulance traffic in San Francisco, Zuckerbe rg San Francisco General Hospital receives the highest volume of cardiac arrest patients in San Francisco. Over the last five years ZSFG has cared 35 -40% of the city's cardiac ar rest (specifically heart atta ck known as STEMI) cases . Additionally, ove r the last five years ZSFG has on average cared 140 - 160 cardiac arrest patients per year. This is an opportunity to provide reliable and timely acce ss to care in a n equitable manner to our patients while also maximizing cost effectiveness . Lac k of access to this form of treatment means SFHN patient mortality rates are higher than peer institutions, higher than predicted by mortality models, and higher than the national average, putting our patients at a higher risk of adve rse outcomes . Lack of this fo rm of tre atment results in delays i n care and ZSFG and the D PH network may incur the cost of transfer and the cost of the hospitalization. In sum, cardiogenic shock and cardiac arrest survival are below state and national averages. ZSFG has the clinical exp ertise to implement an evidenced based care plan to significantly improve survival but currently lacks the necessary equipment to implement a key portion of the care plan . Currently ZSFG is the only STEMI receiving center in San Francisco and one of only a handful institutions in the state to not employ a form of this care path in patient care. This is an equity issue for our patients. IMPACT ON CLIENTS : (units of service and/or number of clients af fected , if applicable ) 92This improved patient treatment and support will allow patients that would ordinarily be transferred to other institutions to remain at ZSFG for care. Using historical trends, we anticipate that transfer for cardiogenic shock will decrease by 90% or appr oximately 20 transfer per y ear. EXPENSE AND REVENUE IMPACT : (for both fiscal years) The operating budget will increase by $1,121,767 in FY22 -23 and ann ualize to $ 1,208,395 in FY23 -24 and offset by revenues of $2,314,046 in FY22 -23 and $2,891,345 in FY WORKFORCE: The increase of Sources Uses: Salary and Benefits Operating Expense Subtotal Uses Net General Fund Subsidy Required (savings)/cost (Uses less Sources) Total FTE's New Positions (List positions by Class, Title and FTE) Class Title FTE FTE 1942 Assistant B22 FY 2022-23 & 202 3-24 Program Change Request DIVISION : DPH - department wide San Francisco General Hospital Population Health Laguna Honda Hospital SF Health Network Wide Ambulatory Care _________ PROGRAM / INITIATIVE TITLE: ZSFG Building Safety and Security TARGETED CLIENTS: Patients and Visitors to ZSFG PROGRAM Fund Impact Favorable/(Unfavorable) 202 3-24 Fund (1,979,806) (2,430,293) PROGRAM DESCRIPTION: of proposed change ) COVID -19 has imposed new operating requirements at ZSFG, many of which will permanently change the way the hospital operates. ZSFG is working to incorporate these changes into its \" new normal\" daily operations. This includes balancing existing health orders that r estrict access to the hospital for visitors while keeping the campus secured and accessible to patients in need of support in alignment with ZSFG's True North Goals of Equity, Care Experience and Developing Our People. The proposed change will add ne eded FTEs to staff the 4 designated entrances at ZSFG : Building 25, Building 5, B uilding 5 Loading Dock and B uilding 80/90. Additionally, this proposal will update all building security systems and devices to current healthcare security industry standards, using the Lenel- OnGuard security management system . JUSTIFICATION: On an average day in June, ZSFG welcomed 1,118 outpatients (many accompanied by a loved one ), 300 individuals visiting inpatients and 6,000 staff and providers who work in one of the 14 campus buildings. Prior to the pandemic, ZSFG was a uniquely open campus, which differed from most other local hospitals. Visiting hours were set, but the absence of criteria for who could visit and visitor check- in workflow left nursing and clinics to manage ZSFG's inconsistent visitation practices. Additionally, the first-floor doors to buildings were typically unlocked and the lobbies and receiving areas of bu ildings were unattended by staff (with the exception of Building 25), leaving many patients and visitors to navigate the complicated buildings to reach their desired location. In March 2020, Health Order No. C19- 06b restricted visitors and non- essential persons to campus and required screening of staff, patients, and visitors. As a result, ZSFG became a closed campus for the first time. Entry was limited through secured access points where verification and screening occurred by internally deployed staff an d city Disaster Service Workers ( DSWs ). Patients and their visitors are now greeted by staff at the designated entrances. They are screened, their needs are triaged and are directed to the appropriate clinic. This change has improved patient experience and safety. In addition, since the implementation of a closed campus, there has been a decrease in the reported crimes against persons and property. 95 While the benefits of this new model are clear, it is not sustainable to continue staffing these posts with deployed DSWs. In addition to staffing for visitor screening, this proposal includes updates to building security systems and devices to current healthcare security industry standards, using the Lenel- OnGuard security management system . DPH Security has planned a 5-year phased approach to integrate security system s for all DPH Hospitals, Clinics, a nd Behavioral Health Facilities, with ZSFG serving as the central hub for input and output alarms, and surveillance camera monitoring. This change is b ased on the department's annual security risk assessments, which identified security -sensitive areas do n ot meet healthcare security industry standards to address access control, duress alarm systems, or appropriate surveillance camera monitoring. Outlying campus clinic buildings are not equipped with intruder alarms systems for after- hour monitoring, duress alarms installed at reception workspaces and exam rooms, surveillance cameras for monitoring all entry points, including behavioral health waiting rooms, cash collection areas , IT and Pharmacy areas, and the campus entry points are not controllable during an emergency . The International Association for Healthcare Safety and Security has developed industry guidelines on the integration of electronic security systems in the healthcare environment. The proposed implementation of the security management system will move DPH toward meeting these standards.

This adjustment is critical to ensuring that DPH is able to continue to provide services and treatments to its patients. The department projec ts cost increases of 10 % for pharmaceuticals and 9% for food . JUSTIFICATION: Market dynamics over the past 5 years have been shifting in a way that has caused the pricing of certain pharmaceuticals to rise at an extraordinary rate. Projected nation -wide incre ases in drug expenditures of 7-10% are consistent among all settings. Primary causes for increase in expenditures include: Specialty Drugs are forecasted to be 50 percent of all drug expenditures in 2022. Novel, very expensive specialty treatments for conditions that previously had either limited to no medication therapy options are continually being approved. The therapeutic drug classes with the largest increases include autoimmune disorders, mental health, HIV and oncology. Increased utilizati on of medications: P rescription utilization is increasing as older patients live longer and healthier lives. Patients over 50 years of age are responsible for 77 percent of prescription growth since 2011. Categories making an impact on drug spend due to inc reased utilization include diabetes, inflammatory conditions, asthma and cardiovascular diseases. The net result of factors that will increase and decrease drug costs at DPH are projected to lead to an overall increase in the cost of pharmaceuticals for t he department of 10% in FY 2022-23. DPH will continue to utilize tight drug formulary control and aggressive use of lower cost generic drugs to help offset increases in expense. In addition, DPH continues to leverage discounts for its food purchase, it expe cts a 9% increase in food purchasing and costs for FY2324 IMPACT ON CLIENTS : (units of service and/or number of clients affected , if applicable ) None.

The services provided by UCSF are outlined in an Affiliation Agreement between the University of California San Francisco and t he Department of Public Health. This initiative increase s the budget for the DPH/UCSF Affiliation Agreement by $1 2.1 million dollars for FY 2023-24 to reflect changes in costs and revenues for UCSF. JUSTIFICATION: The increase in A ffiliation A greemen t costs of FY 2023-24 can be attributed to three factors (1) increases to physician salaries, (2) ongoing increases to clinical staff salaries and (3) flat professional fee revenue. The University of California launched a system wide mandate increasing faculty salaries over several years to be competitive with market rates to retain faculty. Clinical staff, in areas such as the Clinical Laboratory, Respiratory Therapy, Ward 86 and Psychiatry, are mostly represented under collective bargaining agreements. These bargaining units have negotiated salary increases for their members. Professional Fee revenue has been relativel y flat since FY 2015 and does not adequately cover the costs of services provided at ZSFG.

HSF participants with income s above 100%FPL are assessed a quarterly participant fee based on their income ranging between $60 and $450. Participant fees are collected by Sa n Francisco Health Plan (S FHP), which serves as the third party administrator of the HSF program, and remitted to DPH on a quarterly basis. HSF participants who are enr olled through the S F City Option (SFCO) program receive a 75% d iscount on their particip ant fees and their employer contributions are remitted to DPH to support the Healthy San Francis co program that their employees are enrolled in. In June 2021 SFCO Simplification was approved and implemented. As part of SFCO Simplification, effective Aug 3, 2021, SFCO transitioned to one benefit (SF MRA) program, and SFC O emplo yees would no longer enr oll in HSF with a discount. They would instead receive a SFMRA account and can separately enro ll in HSF and use the contributions in their SFMRA account to pay for any quarterly fee s and other approved costs. This program change mean s that DPH will no longer receive any direct SFCO employer contributions for SFCO employees enrolled in HSF. DPH will continue to receive any HSF participant fees collected . JUSTIFICATION: SFCO Simplificatio n was approved and implemented to reduce barriers for SFCO employees to enroll an d utilize their contribution. Sim plifying the SFCO to one be nefit p rogram consisting of SF MRA also streamlined the program administration and allows employees greater flexi bility and dollar for dollar access to t heir employer contribution. DPH implemented SF MRA deactivation policy 2015 for the San Fra ncisco City Option (SF CO) program. SFMRA accou nts are deacti vated after two ye ars of ina ctivity wit h noti cing to account holde rs. DPH has been working with City Attorney, Controller Office , Treasur er/Tax C ollecto r and May or's Office to de termine the right policy to process inactive SFCO funds. Upon advisement of City Atto rney and other departments, DPH is pursuing use of the escheatment process authorized under State law . This escheatment process , which is currently under development with above mentioned sta keholders will replace current deactivation policy . 102 IMPACT ON CLIENTS : (units of service and/ or number of clients affect ed, if ap plicable) SFCO employees can continue to enroll in the HSF program and can use their employer contributions to pay for participant fees or other approved expenditures. 300 current employees enrolled in HSF with a discount wer e autom atically pr ovided with an SF MRA accoun t and their current HSF discounts were continued. EXPENSE AND REV ENUE IMPACT : (for both fiscal years) Under the changes described above, DPH would continue to receive participant fees but w ould no longer receive employer contributions for employees enrolled in HSF. This represent s a decrease in revenue of $20,530,000 annually. Depending on the implementation of the escheatment process , it is possible that replacement revenue could become available to the City in future years.
