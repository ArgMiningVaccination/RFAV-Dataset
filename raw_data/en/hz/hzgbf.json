We derive the energy balance by considering an arbitrary reactor volume element, shown in Figure 6.1 1 / 149 General Energy Balance m1 E1 cj1m0 E0 cj0VQ W The statement of conservation of energy for this system takes the form, /braceleftbiggrate of energy accumulation/bracerightbigg = rate of energy entering system by inflow rate of energy leaving system by outflow +/braceleftbiggrate of heat added to system/bracerightbigg +/braceleftbiggrate of work done on system/bracerightbigg (1) 2 / 149Work Term In terms of the defined variables, we can write Equation 6.1 as, dE dt=m0E0m1E1+Q+W (6.2) in which the hat indicates an energy per unit mass. It is convenient to split the work term into three parts: Wf, the work done by the flow streams while moving material into and out of the reactor, Ws, the shaft work being done by stirrers, compressors, etc., and Wb, the work done when moving the system boundary.

We also can express the volumetric flowrate as a mass flowrate divided by the density, Q=m/ Wf=m0P0 0m1P1 1 The overall rate of work can then be expressed as W=Wf+Ws+Wb=m0P0 0m1P1 1+Ws+Wb (6.4) 4 / 149Energy Terms The total energy may be regarded as composed of many forms. Obvious contributions to the total energy arise from the internal, kinetic and potential energies.1 E=U+K+ +\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 For our purposes in this chapter, we consider only these forms of energy. Recalling the definition of enthalpy, H=U+PV, or expressed on a per-unit mass basis, H=U+P/, allows us to rewrite Equation 6.2 d = m0/parenleftig H+K+/parenrightig 0m1/parenleftig H+K+/parenrightig 1+Q+Ws+Wb (6.5) 1In some cases one might need to consider also electrical and magnetic energies. For example, we might consider the motion of charged ionic species between the plates in a battery cell. 5 / 149 The Batch Reactor Since the batch reactor has no flow streams Equation 6.5 reduces to d dt(U+K+ ) = Q+Ws+Wb (6.6) In chemical reactors, we normally assume the internal energyis the dominant contribution and neglect the kinetic and potential energies. Normally we neglect the work done by the stirrer, unless the mixture is highly viscous and the stirring operation draws significant power [3]. Neglecting kinetic and potential energies and shaft work yields dU dt+PdVR dt=Q (6.7) in which Wb=PdV R/dt. 6 / 149Batch reactor in terms of enthalpy It is convenient to use enthalpy rather than internal energy in the subsequent development. Taking the differential of the definition of enthalpy gives for V=VR dH=dU+PdV R+VRdP Forming the time derivatives and substitution into Equation 6.7 gives dH dtVRdP dt=Q (6.8) 7 / 149 Effect of changing T,P,nj Forsingle-phase systems , we consider the enthalpy as a function of temperature, pressure and number of moles, and express j/parenleftbiggH nj/parenrightbigg T,P,nkdnj (6.9) The first partial derivative is the definition of the heat capacity, CP. CP=VRCP The second partial derivative can be expressed as /parenleftbiggH P/parenrightbigg T,nj=VT/parenleftbiggV T/parenrightbigg P,nj=V(1T) in which = (1/V)(V/T)P,njis the coefficient of expansion of the mixture.

Substitution into the constant-volume gives Constant-volume gas. VRCVdT reactors Example 6.1: constant-volume reactors Consider the following two well-mixed, adiabatic, gas-phase batch reactors for the elementary and irreversible decomposition of A to B, Ak 2B Reactor 1: The reactor volume is held constant (reactor pressure therefore changes). Reactor 2: The reactor pressure is held constant (reactor volume therefore changes). Both reactors are charged with pure A at 1.0 atm and khas the usual Arrhenius activation energy dependence on temperature, k(T) =k0exp(E/T) The heat of reaction, HR, and heat capacity of the mixture, CP, may be assumed constant over the composition and temperature range expected. Write the material and energy balances for these two reactors. Which reactor converts the reactant more quickly? 2 13 / 149 Solution \u2014 Material balance The material balance is d(cAVR) dt=RAVR Substituting in the reaction-rate expression, r=k(T)cA, and using the number of moles of A, nA=cAVRyields dnA dt=k(T)nA (6.20) Notice the temperature dependence of k(T) prevents us from solving this differential equation immediately. We must solve it simultaneously with the energy balance, which provides the information for how the temperature changes. 14 / 149Energy balance, constant volume The energy balances for the two reactors are notthe same. We consider first the constant-volume reactor. For the A 2B stoichiometry, we substitute the rate expression and \u00af = 1 into Equation 6.17 to obtain CVdT dt=(HRRT)knA in which CV=VRCVis the total constant-volume heat capacity. 15 / 149 Energy balance, constant pressure The energy balance for the constant-pressure case follows from Equation 6.15 CPdT dt=HRknA in which CP=VRCPis the total constant-pressure heat capacity. For an ideal gas, we know from thermodynamics that the two total heat capacities are simply related, CV=CPnR (6.21) 16 / 149Express all moles in terms of nA Comparing the production rates of A and B produces 2nA+nB= 2nA0+nB0 Because there is no B in the reactor initially, subtracting nAfrom both sides yields for the total number of moles n=nA+nB= 2nA0nA 17 / 149 The two energy balances Substitution of the above and Equation 6.21 into the constant-volume case yields dT dt=(HRRT)knA CP(2nA0nA)Rconstant volume (6.22) and the temperature differential equation for the constant-pressure case is dT dt=HRknA CPconstant pressure (6.23) 18 / 149So who's faster? We see by comparing Equations 6.22 and 6.23 that the numerator in the constant-volume case is larger because HRis negative and the positive RTis subtracted. We also see the denominator is smaller because CPis positive and the positive nRis subtracted. Therefore the time derivative of the temperature is larger for the constant-volume case. The reaction proceeds more quickly in the constant-volume case. The constant-pressure reactor is expending work to increase the reactor size, and this work results in a lower temperature and slower reaction rate compared to the constant-volume case. 19 / 149 Liquid-phase batch reactor Example 6.2: Liquid-phase batch reactor The exothermic elementary liquid-phase reaction A+Bk C, r=kcAcB is carried out in a batch reactor with a cooling coil to keep the reactor isothermal at 27C. The reactor is initially charged with equal concentrations of A and B and no C, cA0=cB0= 2.0 mol/L ,cC0= 0. 1How long does it take to reach 95% conversion? 2What is the total amount of heat (kcal) that must be removed by the cooling coil when this conversion is reached? 3What is the maximum rateat which heat must be removed by the cooling coil (kcal/min) and at what time does this maximum occur? 4What is the adiabatic temperature rise for this reactor and what is its significance? Additional data: Rate constant, k= 0.01725 L/mol\u00b7min, at 27C Heat of reaction, HR=10kcal/mol A, 27C Partial molar heat capacities, CPA=CPB= 20 cal/mol \u00b7K,CPC= 40 cal/mol K Reactor volume, VR= 1200 L 2 20 / 149Solution I 1Assuming constant density, the material balance for component A is dcA dt=kcAcB The stoichiometry of the reaction, and the material balance for B gives cAcB=cA0cB0= 0 orcA=cB.

If the heat removal is manipulated to maintain constant reactor temperature, the time derivative in Equation 6.15 vanishes leaving Q= HRrVR (6.24) Substituting dcA/dt=rand multiplying right-hand side is a maximum in absolute value (note it is a negative quantity) when cAis a maximum, which occurs for cA=cA0, giving kcal/min 22 / 149Solution III 4The adiabatic temperature rise is calculated from the energy balance without the heat-transfer term VRCPdT dt=HRrVR Substituting the material balance dnA/dt=rVRgives VRCPdT= HRdnA (6.25) Because we are given the partial molar heat capacities CPj=/parenleftbiggHj T/parenrightbigg P,nk it is convenient to evaluate the total heat capacity as VRCP=ns/summationdisplay j=1CPjnj For a batch reactor, the number of moles can be related to the reaction extent by nj=nj0+j, so we can express the right-hand side of the previous equation as ns/summationdisplay j=1CPjnj=/summationdisplay jCPjnj0+CP 23 / 149 Solution IV in which CP=/summationtext jjCPj. If we assume the partial molar heat capacities are independent of temperature and composition we have CP= 0 and VRCP=ns/summationdisplay j=1CPjnj0 Integrating Equation 6.25 with constant heat capacity gives T=HR/summationtext jCPjnj0nA The maximum temperature rise corresponds to complete conversion of the reactants and can be computed from Tmax= 250 K The adiabatic temperature rise indicates the potential danger of a coolant system failure. In this case the reactants contain enough internal energy to raise the reactor temperature by 250 K. 24 / 149The CSTR \u2014 Dynamic 0m1/parenleftig H+K+/parenrightig 1+Q+Ws+Wb We assume that the internal energy is the dominant contribution to the total energy and take the entire reactor contents as the volume element. We denote the feed stream with flowrate Qf, density f, enthalpy Hf, and component j concentration cjf. The outflow stream is flowing out of a well-mixed reactor and its intensive properties are therefore assumed the same as the reactor contents. Its flowrate is denoted Q. Writing Equation 6.5 for this reactor gives, dU dt=QffHfQH+Q+Ws+Wb (6.26) 25 / 149 The CSTR If we neglect the shaft work dU dt+PdVR dt=QffHfQH+Q or if we use the enthalpy a single-phase system we consider the change in Hdue to changes in T,P,nj dH=VRCPdT+ dt=QfcjfQcj+/summationdisplay iijriVR (6.30) dt=/summationdisplay iHRiriVR+/summationdisplay jcjfQf(HjfHj) +Q (6.31) 27 / 149 Special cases Again, a variety of important special cases may be considered.

Note that the heats of reaction HRiare evaluated at the reactor temperature and composition. 31 / 149 Liquid phase, Steady-State Operation If the heat capacity of the liquid phase does not change significantly with composition or temperature, possibly because of the presence of a large excess of a nonreacting solvent, and we neglect the pressure effect on enthalpy, which is normally small for a liquid, we obtain HjfHj=CPj(TfT) Substitution into Equation 6.34 gives /summationdisplay iriHRiVR+QffCP(TfT) +Q= 0 (6.35) 32 / 149Temperature control in a CSTR Example 6.3: Temperature control in a CSTR An aqueous solution of species A undergoes the following elementary reaction in a 2000 L CSTR Ak1 k1R H R=18kcal/mol Q1Q225C 25C The 4 mol/L and feed flowrate, Qf, is 250 L/min. 2 33 / 149 The reaction-rate constants have been determined experimentally k1= 3\u00d7107e5838/Tmin1 K1= 1.9\u00d71011e9059/T 1At what temperature must the reactor be operated to achieve 80% conversion? 2What are the heat duties of the two heat exchangers if the feed enters at 25Cand the product is to be withdrawn at this temperature? The heat capacity of feed and product streams can be approximated by the heat capacity of water, CP= 1cal/g K. 34 / 149Solution 1The steady-state material balances for components A and R in a constant-density CSTR are Q(cAfcA)rVR= 0 Q(cRfcR) +rVR= 0 Adding these equations and noting cRf= 0 gives cR=cAfcA Substituting this result into the rate expression gives r=k1(cA1 K1(cAfcA)) Substitution into the material balance for A gives Q(cAfcA)k1(cA1 K1(cAfcA))VR= 0 (6.36) If we set cA= 0.2cAfto achieve 80% conversion, we have one equation and one unknown, T, because k1andK1are given functions of temperature. Solving this equation numerically gives T= 334 K 35 / 149 Watch out Because the reaction is reversible, we do not know if 80% conversion is achievable for any temperature when we attempt to solve Equation 6.36. It may be valuable to first make a plot of the conversion as a function of reactor temperature. If we solve Equation 6.36 for cA, we have cA=Q/VR+k1/K1 Q/VR+k1(1 + 1 /K1) 36 / 149xAversus T 00.20.40.60.81 240 260 280 300 320 340 360 380 400xA T(K) We see that the conversion 80% is just reachable at 334 K, and that for any conversion lower than this value, there are two solutions. 37 / 149 Heat removal rate 2A simple calculation for the heat-removal rate required to bring the reactor outflow stream from 334 Kto 298 Kgives Q2=QfCPT = (250 L/min)(1000 g/L)(1 cal/g Q1=k1(cA1 K1(cAfcA))HRVRQfCP(TfT) =5.4\u00d7103kcal/min 38 / 149Steady-State Multiplicity The coupling of the material and energy balances for the CSTR can give rise to some surprisingly complex and interesting behavior. Even the steady-state solution of the material and energy balances holds some surprises. In this section we explore the fact that the steady state of the CSTR is not necessarily unique. As many as three steady-state solutions to the material and energy balances may exist for even the simplest kinetic mechanisms. This phenomenon is known as steady-state multiplicity. 39 / 149 An Example We introduce this topic with a simple example [5]. Consider an adiabatic, constant-volume CSTR with the following elementary reaction taking place in the liquid phase Ak B We wish to compute the steady-state reactor conversion and temperature. The data and parameters are listed in Table 6.1. 40 / 149Parameters Parameter Value Units Tf 298 K Tm 298 K 4.0 kJ/kg 6.1: Parameter values for multiple steady states. 41 / 149 Material Balance The material balance for component A is d(cAVR) dt=QfcAfQcA+RAVR The production rate is given by RA=k(T)cA For the steady-state reactor with constant-density, liquid-phase streams, the material balance simplifies to 0 =cAf(1 + k)cA (6.37) 42 / 149Rate constant depends on temperature Equation 6.37 is one nonlinear algebraic equation in two unknowns: cAandT. The temperature appears in the rate-constant function, k(T) =kmeE(1/T1/Tm) Now we write the energy balance. We assume the heat capacity of the mixture is constant and independent of composition and temperature. 43 / 149 Energy balance b. Constant-volume reactor Table: Energy balances for the CSTR. 44 / 149Energy balance We assume the heat capacity of the mixture is constant and independent of composition and temperature. With these assumptions, the steady-state energy balance reduces to 0 =kcAHRVR+QffCP(TfT) +UoA(TaT) Dividing through by VRand noting Uo= 0 for the adiabatic reactor gives 0 =kcAHR+CPs (TfT) (6.38) in which CPs=fCP, a heat capacity per volume. 45 / 149 Two algebraic equations, two unknowns 0 =cAf(1 + k(T))cA 0 =k(T)cAHR+CPs (TfT) The solution of these two equations for cAandTprovide the steady-state CSTR solution. The parameters appearing in the problem are: cAf,Tf,,CPs,km,Tm,E, HR. We wish to study this solution as a function of one of these parameters, , the reactor residence time. 46 / 149Let's compute Set HR= 0 to model the isothermal case. Find cA() and T() as you vary , 01000 min. We will need the following trick later. Switch the roles of cAandand find (cA) andT(cA) versus cAfor 0cAcAf. It doesn't matter which is the parameter and which is the unknown, you can still plotcA() and T(). Check that both approaches give the same plot. For the isothermal reactor, we already have shown that cA=cAf 1 +k, x=k 1 +k 47 / 149 Exothermic (and endothermic) cases Set HR=3\u00d7105kJ/kmol and solve again. What has happened? Fill in a few more HRvalues and compare to Figures 6.5-6.6. Set HR= +5\u00d7104kJ/kmol and try an endothermic case. 48 / 149Summary of the results I 00.10.20.30.40.50.60.70.80.91 1 10 100 1000 10000 100000 x (min)30 20 10 5 0 +5 Figure 6.5: Steady-state conversion versus residence time for different values of the heat of reaction ( HR\u00d7104kJ/kmol). 49 / 149 Summary of the results II 260280300320340360380400420440460 1 10 100 1000 10000 100000 T(K) (min)30 20 10 5 0 +5 Figure 6.6: Steady-state temperature versus residence time for different values of the heat of reaction ( HR\u00d7104kJ/kmol). 50 / 149Steady-state multiplicity, ignition, extinction Note that if the heat of reaction is more exothermic than 10 kJ/kmol, there is a range of residence times in which there is not one but several steady-state solutions, three solutions in this case. The reactor is said to exhibit steady-state multiplicity for these values of residence time. The points at which the steady-state curves turn are known as ignition and extinction points. 51 / 149 00.10.20.30.40.50.60.70.80.91 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45ignition pointextinction point x (min) Figure 6.7: Steady-state conversion versus residence time for HR=3\u00d7105kJ/kmol; ignition and extinction points. 52 / 149280300320340360380400420440460 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45ignition pointextinction point T(K) (min) Figure 6.8: Steady-state temperature versus residence time for HR=3\u00d7105kJ/kmol; ignition and extinction points. 53 / 149 Hysteresis at the ignition and extinction points Consider a small value of residence time, 10 min, at low conversion of A and low temperature. If the feed flowrate were decreased slightly ( increased), there would be a small upset and the reactor would increase in conversion and temperature as it approached the new steady state at the new residence time. Consider the situation at the ignition point, however, = 30.9 min at x= 0.09 and T= 311 K. If there is a small decrease in feed flowrate there is no steady state near the temperature and concentration of the reactor. A large release of heat occurs and the reactor ignites and moves to the steady state near x= 1 and T= 448 K. A reactor operating near the extinction point can exhibit the opposite phenomenon. A small increase in feed flowrate causes the residence time to decrease enough so that no steady-state solution exists near the current temperature and concentration. A rapid drop in temperature and increase in concentration of A occurs as the reactor approaches the new steady state. 54 / 149Stability of the Steady State We next discuss why some steady states are stable and others are unstable. This discussion comes in two parts. First we present a plausibility argument and develop some physical intuition by constructing and examining van Heerden diagrams [6]. The text also presents a rigorous mathematical argument, which has wide applicability in analyzing the stability of any system described by differential equations. Dynamic Model We examine the stability numerically by solving the dynamic model. dcA dt=cAfcA kcA (6.40) dT dt=UoA VRCPs(TaT) +TfT HR CPskcA 55 / 149 Reactor Stability \u2014 Plausibility Argument 56 / 149Steady-state temperature versus residence time 280300320340360380400420440460 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 CG BDF AE T(K) (min) Figure 6.9: Steady-state temperature versus residence time for HR=3\u00d7105kJ/kmol. 57 / 149 Heat generate and heat removal If we substitute the the mass balance for cAinto the energy balance, we obtain one equation for one unknown, T, 0 term the heat-generation rate, Qg. We call the second term the heat-removal rate, Qr, Qg=k(T) 1 +k(T)cAfHR, Qr=CPs (TTf) in which we emphasize the temperature dependence of the rate constant, k(T) =kmeE(1/T1/Tm) 58 / 149Graphical solution Obviously we have a steady-state solution when these two quantities are equal. Consider plotting these two functions as Tvaries. The heat-removal rate is simply a straight line with slope CPs/. The heat-generation rate is a nonlinear function that is asymptotically constant at low temperatures ( k(T) much less than one) and high temperatures ( k(T) much greater than one). These two functions are plotted next for = 1.79 min. 59 / 149 Van Heerden diagram 1\u00d71050\u00d71001\u00d71052\u00d71053\u00d71054\u00d71055\u00d7105 250 300 350 400 450 500 AE (extinction) heat (kJ/m3\u00b7min) T(K)removal generation Figure 6.10: Rates of heat generation and removal for = 1.79 min. 60 / 149Changing the residence time Notice the two intersections of the heat-generation and heat-removal functions corresponding to steady states A and E. If we decrease the residence time slightly, the slope of the heat-removal line increases and the intersection corresponding to point A shifts slightly. Because the two curves are just tangent at point E, however, the solution at point E disappears, another indicator that point E is an extinction point. 61 / 149 Changing the residence time The other view of changing the residence time. 280300320340360380400420440460 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 CG BDF AE T(K) (min) 62 / 149Stability \u2014 small residence time If we were to increase the reactor temperature slightly, we would be to the right of point A in Figure 6.10. To the right of A we notice that the heat-removal rate is larger than the heat-generation rate. That causes the reactor to cool, which moves the temperature back to the left. In other words, the system responds by resisting our applied perturbation. Similarly, consider a decrease to the reactor temperature. To the left of point A, the heat-generation rate is larger than the heat-removal rate causing the reactor to heat up and move back to the right. Point A is a stable steady state because small perturbations are rejected by the system. 63 / 149 Intermediate residence time Consider next the points on the middle branch.

Figure 6.11 displays the heat-generation and heat-removal rates for points B, D and F, = 15 min. Point B on the lower branch is stable as was point A. Point F on the upper branch also is stable because the slope of the heat-generation rate is smaller than the heat-removal rate at point F. At point D, however, the slope of the heat-generation rate is larger than the heat-removal rate. For point D, increasing temperature causes heat generation to be larger than heat removal, and decreasing temperature causes heat generation to be smaller than heat removal. Both of these perturbations are amplified by the system at point D, and this solution is unstable.

Please read the text. 70 / 149A simple mechanical analogy You may find it helpful to draw an analogy between the chemical reactor with multiple steady states and simple mechanical systems that exhibit the same behavior. Consider a marble on a track in a gravitational field as depicted in Figure 6.15. 71 / 149 A simple mechanical analogy g A Figure 6.15: Marble on a track in a gravitational field; point A is the unique, stable steady state. 72 / 149Single steady state Based on our physical experience with such systems we conclude immediately that the system has a single steady state, position A, which is asymptotically stable. If we expressed Newton's laws of motion for this system, and linearized the model at point A, we would expect to see eigenvalues with negative real part and nonzero imaginary part because the system exhibits a decaying oscillation back to the steady-state position after a perturbation. The oscillation decays because of the friction between the marble and the track. 73 / 149 Multiple steady states Now consider the track depicted in Figure 6.16. 74 / 149A simple mechanical analogy g A Figure: Marble on a track in a gravitational field; point A is the unique, stable steady state. A Cg B Figure 6.16: Marble on a track with three steady states; points A and C are stable, and point B is unstable. 75 / 149 Multiple steady states Here we have three steady states, the three positions where the tangent curve to the track has zero slope. This situation is analogous to the chemical reactor with multiple steady states. The steady states A and C are obviously stable and B is unstable. Perturbations from point B to the right are attracted to steady-state C and perturbations to the left are attracted to steady-state A. The significant difference between the reactor and marble systems is that the marble decays to steady state in an oscillatory fashion, and the reactor, with its zero imaginary eigenvalues, returns to the steady state without overshoot or oscillation. 76 / 149Ignition and extinction Now consider the track depicted in Figure 6.17. 77 / 149 A simple mechanical analogy g A Figure: Marble on a track in a gravitational field; point A is the unique, stable steady state. A Cg B Figure: Marble on a track with three steady states; points A and C are stable, and point B is unstable. g C A Figure 6.17: Marble on a track with an ignition point (A) and a stable steady state (C). 78 / 149Ignition and extinction We have flattened the track between points A and B in Figure 6.16 so there is just a single point of zero slope, now marked point A. Point A now corresponds to a reactor ignition point as shown in Figures 6.7 and 6.8. Small perturbations push the marble over to the only remaining steady state, point C, which remains stable. 79 / 149 Some real surprises \u2014 Sustained Oscillations, Limit Cycles The dynamic behavior of the CSTR can be more complicated than multiple steady states with ignition, extinction and hysteresis. In fact, at a given operating condition, all steady states may be unstable and the reactor may exhibit sustained oscillations or limit cycles. Consider the same simple kinetic scheme as in the previous section, Ak B but with the following parameter values. 80 / 149Param. Value Units Tf 298 K Tm 298 K values for limit cycles. Note: the last line of this table is missing in the first printing! Notice that the activation energy in Table 6.3 is significantly larger than in Table 6.1. 81 / 149 Even more twisted steady-state behavior If we compute the solutions to the steady-state mass and energy balances with these new values of parameters, we obtain the results displayed in the next Figures. 82 / 14900.10.20.30.40.50.60.70.80.91 0 20 40 60 80 100x (min) Figure 6.18: Steady-state conversion versus residence time. 83 / 149 280300320340360380400420 0 20 40 60 80 100T(K) (min) Figure 6.19: Steady-state temperature versus residence time.

Notice the steady-state solution curve has become a bit deformed and the simple s-shaped multiplicities in Figures 6.7 and 6.8 have taken on a mushroom shape with the new parameters. 86 / 149We have labeled points A-F on the steady-state curves. Table 6.4 summarizes the locations of these points in terms of the residence times, the steady-state conversions and temperatures, and the eigenvalue of the Jacobian with largest real part.

What can simulations can show us. A residence time of = 35 min is between points E and F as shown in Table 6.4. Solving the dynamic mass and energy balances with this value of residence time produces 88 / 14900.51 0 100 200 300 400 500 600280300320340360380400 x(t) T(t) x T(K) time (min) Figure 6.25: Conversion and temperature vs. time for = 35 min. 89 / 149 Is this possible? We see that the solution does not approach the steady state but oscillates continuously. These oscillations are sustained; they do not damp out at large times. Notice also that the amplitude of the oscillation is large, more than 80 Kin temperature and 50% in conversion. We can obtain another nice view of this result if we plot the conversion versus the temperature rather than both of them versus time. This kind of plot is known as a phase plot or phase portrait 90 / 14900.10.20.30.40.50.60.70.80.91 290 300 310 320 330 340 350 360 370 380 390 400x T(K) Figure 6.26: Phase portrait of conversion versus temperature for feed initial condition; = 35 min. 91 / 149 Time increases as we walk along the phase plot; the reactor ignites, then slowly decays, ignites again, and eventually winds onto the steady limit cycle shown in the figure. The next figure explores the effect of initial conditions. 92 / 14900.10.20.30.40.50.60.70.80.91 290 300 310 320 330 340 350 360 370 380 390 400 x T(K) Figure 6.27: Phase portrait of conversion versus temperature for several initial conditions; = 35 min. 93 / 149 The trajectory starting with the feed temperature and concentration is shown again. The trajectory starting in the upper left of the figure has the feed temperature and zero A concentration as its initial condition. Several other initial conditions inside the limit cycle are shown also, including starting the reactor at the unstable steady state. All of these initial conditions wind onto the same final limit cycle. We say that the limit cycle is a global attractor because all initial conditions wind onto this same solution. 94 / 149Decrease residence time If we decrease the residence time to = 30 min, we are close to point E, where the stability of the upper steady state changes. A simulation at this residence time is shown in the next figure. Notice the amplitude of these oscillations is much smaller, and the shape is more like a pure sine wave. 95 / 149 00.51 0 50 100 150 200 250 300280300320340360380400 x(t) T(t) x T(K) time (min) Figure 6.28: Conversion and temperature vs. time for = 30 min. 96 / 14900.51 0 100 200 300 400 500 600 700 800280300320340360380400 x(t) T(t) x T(K) time (min) Figure 6.29: Conversion and temperature vs. time for = 72.3 min. 97 / 149 Increase residence time As we pass point F, the steady state is again stable. A simulation near point F is shown in Figure 6.29. Notice, in contrast to point E, the amplitude of the oscillations is not small near point F. To see how limit cycles can remain after the steady state regains its stability, consider the next figure, constructed for = 73.1 min. 98 / 1490.40.50.60.70.80.91 300 305 310 315 320 325x T(K) Figure 6.30: Phase portrait of conversion versus temperature at = 73.1 min showing stable and unstable limit cycles, and a stable steady state. 99 / 149 The figure depicts the stable steady state, indicated by a solid circle, surrounded by an unstable limit cycle, indicated by the dashed line. The unstable limit cycle is in turn surrounded by a stable limit cycle. Note that all initial conditions outside of the stable limit cycle would converge to the stable limit cycle from the outside. All initial conditions in the region between the unstable and stable limit cycles would converge to the stable limit cycle from the inside. Finally, all initial conditions inside the unstable limit cycle are attracted to the stable steady state. We have a quantitative measure of a perturbation capable of knocking the system from the steady state onto a periodic solution. 100 / 149Mechanical System Analogy We may modify our simple mechanical system to illustrate somewhat analogous limit-cycle behavior. Consider the marble and track system g B C A 101 / 149 Mechanical System We have three steady states; steady-state A is again stable and steady-state B is unstable. At this point we cheat thermodynamics a bit to achieve the desired behavior. Imagine the track consists of a frictionless material to the right of point B. Without friction in the vicinity of point C, the steady state is not asymptotically stable. Perturbations from point C do not return to the steady state but continually oscillate. The analogy is not perfect because a single limit cycle does not surround the unstable point C as in the chemical reactor. But the analogy may prove helpful in demystifying these kinds of reactor behaviors. Consider why we were compelled to violate the second law to achieve sustained oscillations in the simple mechanical system but the reactor can continually oscillate without such violation. 102 / 149Further Reading on CSTR Dynamics and Stability Large topic, studied intensely by chemical engineering researchers in the 1970s-1980s. 103 / 149 The Semi-Batch Reactor The development of the semi-batch reactor energy balance follows directly from the CSTR energy balance derivation by setting Q= 0. The main results are summarized in Table 6.9 at the end of this chapter. 104 / 149The Plug-Flow Reactor To derive an energy balance for the plug-flow reactor (PFR), consider the volume / 149 If we write Equation 6.5 for this element and neglect kinetic and potential energies and shaft work, we obtain t(UA cz) =mH|zmH|z+z+Q in which Acis the cross-sectional area of the tube, Ris the tube outer radius, and Qis the heat transferred through the wall, normally expressed using an overall heat-transfer coefficient Q=Uo2Rz(TaT) Dividing by Aczand taking the limit z0, =1 Ac z(QH) + q in which q= (2/R)Uo(TaT) and we express the mass flowrate as m=Q. 106 / 149Some thermodynamics occurs, and . . . In unpacked tubes, the pressure drop is usually negligible, and for an ideal gas, T= 1. For both of these cases, we have Ideal gas, or neglect pressure drop. QCPdT dV=/summationdisplay iHRiri+ q (6.51) Equation 6.51 is the usual energy balance for PFRs in this chapter. The next chapter considers packed-bed reactors in which the pressure drop may be significant. 107 / 149 PFR and interstage cooling I Example 6.4: PFR and interstage cooling Consider the reversible, gas-phase reaction Ak1 k1B The reaction is carried out in two long, adiabatic, plug-flow reactors with an interstage cooler between them as shown below Q Q 2 The feed consists of component A diluted in an inert N 2stream, NAf/NIf= 0.1,NBf= 108 / 149PFR and interstage cooling II Because the inert stream is present in such excess, we assume that the heat capacity of the mixture is equal to the heat capacity of nitrogen and is independent of temperature for the temperature range we expect. The heat of reaction is HR=5850 BTU/lbmol and can be assumed constant. The value of the equilibrium constant is K=k1/k1= 1.5 at the feed temperature. 109 / 149 Questions I 1Write down the mole and energy balances that would apply in the reactors. Make sure all variables in your equations are expressed in terms of TandNA. What other assumptions did you make? 2If the reactors are long, we may assume that the mixture is close to equilibrium at the exit. Using the mole balance, express NAat the exit of the first reactor in terms of the feed conditions and the equilibrium constant, K. 3Using the energy balance, express Tat the exit of the first reactor in terms of the feed conditions and NA. 4Notice we have two equations and two unknowns because Kis a strong function of T. Solve these two equations numerically and determine the temperature and conversion at the exit of the first reactor. Alternatively, you can substitute the material balance into the energy balance to obtain one equation for T. Solve this equation to determine the temperature at the exit of the first reactor. What is the conversion at the exit of the first reactor? 5Assume that economics dictate that we must run this reaction to 70% conversion to make a profit. How much heat must be removed in the interstage cooler to be able to achieve this conversion at the exit of the second reactor? What are the temperatures at the inlet and outlet of the second reactor? 6How would you calculate the actual conversion achieved for two PFRs of specified sizes (rather than \"long\" ones) with this value of Q? 110 / 149Answers I 1The steady-state molar flow of A is given by the PFR material balance dNA dV=RA=r (6.53) and the rate expression for the reversible reaction is given by r=k1cAk1cB= (k1NAk1NB)/Q The molar flow of B is given by dNB/dV=r, so we conclude NB=NAf+NBfNA=NAfNA If we assume the mixture behaves as an ideal gas at these conditions, c=P/RTor Q=RT PnS/summationdisplay j=1Nj The material balance for inert gives dNI/dV= 0, so we have the total molar flow is/summationtextns j=1Nj=NAf+NIfand the volumetric flowrate is Q=RT P(NAf+NIf) 111 / 149 Answers II and the reaction rate is r=P RT/parenleftbiggk1NAk1(NAfNA) NAf+NIf/parenrightbigg which is in terms of TandNA.

If we assume the heat of reaction and the heat capacity are weak functions of temperature and composition, we can perform the integral yielding T1T1f=HR mCP(NANAf) 4T830 + 80 .1/parenleftbigg1 1 are summarized in Figure 6.34. 113 / molar flows for tubular reactors with interstage cooling. 114 / 149Plug-Flow Reactor Hot Spot and Runaway For exothermic, gas-phase reactions in a PFR, the heat release generally leads to the formation of a reactor hot spot, a point along the reactor length at which the temperature profile achieves a maximum. If the reaction is highly exothermic, the temperature profile can be very sensitive to parameters, and a small increase in the inlet temperature or reactant feed concentration, for example, can lead to large changes in the temperature profile. A sudden, large increase in the reactor temperature due to a small change in feed conditions is known as reactor runaway. Reactor runaway is highly dangerous, and operating conditions are normally chosen to keep reactors far from the runaway condition. 115 / 149 Oxidation of o-xylene to phthalic + 3H2O is highly exothermic. The reaction is carried out in PFR tube bundles with molten salt circulating as the heat transfer fluid [2]. The o-xylene is mixed with air before entering the PFR. The reaction rate is limited by maintaining a low concentration of hydrocarbon in the feed. The mole fraction of o-xylene is less than 2%. Under these conditions, the large excess of oxygen leads to a pseudo-first-order rate expression r=kmexp/bracketleftbigg E/parenleftbigg1 II in which cxis the o-xylene concentration. The operating pressure is atmospheric. Calculate the temperature and o-xylene composition profiles. The kinetic parameters are adapted from Van Welsenaere and Froment and given in Table 6.5 [7].

Figure 6.35 shows the molar flow of o-xylene versus reactor length for several values of the feed temperature. The corresponding temperature profile is shown in Figure 6.36. 118 / 149Solution II 0.0\u00d71002.0\u00d71074.0\u00d71076.0\u00d71078.0\u00d71071.0\u00d71061.2\u00d71061.4\u00d71061.6\u00d71061.8\u00d7106 0 0 .2 0 .4 0 .6 0 .8 1 1 .2 1 .4615 620 625 Tf= 630 Nx(kmol/s) z(m) Figure 6.35: Molar flow of o-xylene versus reactor length for different feed temperatures. 119 / 149 Solution III 600620640660680700720740 0 0 .2 0 .4 0 .6 0 .8 1 1 .2 1 .4615620625Tf= 630 T(K) z(m) Figure 6.36: Reactor temperature versus length for different feed temperatures. 120 / 149Solution IV We see a hotspot in the reactor for each feed temperature. Notice the hotspot temperature increases and moves down the tube as we increase the feed temperature. Finally, notice if we increase the feed temperature above about 631 K, the temperature spikes quickly to a large value and all of the o-xylene is converted by z= 0.6 m, which is a classic example of reactor runaway. To avoid this reactor runaway, we must maintain the feed temperature below a safe value. This safe value obviously also depends on how well we can control the composition and temperature in the feed stream. Tighter control allows us to operate safely at higher feed temperatures and feed o-xylene mole fractions, which increases the production rate. 121 / 149 The Autothermal Plug-Flow Reactor In many applications, it is necessary to heat a feed stream to achieve a reactor inlet temperature having a high reaction rate. If the reaction also is exothermic, we have the possibility to lower the reactor operating cost by heat integration. The essential idea is to use the heat released by the reaction to heat the feed stream. As a simple example of this concept, consider the following heat integration scheme 122 / 149catalyst bed where reaction occurs feed productspreheater reactantsannulus in which feed is further heated T(0) TaT Figure 6.37: Autothermal plug-flow reactor; the heat released by the exothermic reaction is used to preheat the feed. 123 / 149 This reactor configuration is known as an autothermal plug-flow reactor. The reactor system is an annular tube. The feed passes through the outer region and is heated through contact with the hot reactor wall. The feed then enters the inner reaction region, which is filled with the catalyst, and flows countercurrently to the feed stream. The heat released due to reaction in the inner region is used to heat the feed in the outer region. When the reactor is operating at steady state, no external heat is required to preheat the feed. Of course, during the reactor start up, external heat must be supplied to ignite the reactor. 124 / 149The added complexity of heat integration Although recycle of energy can offer greatly lower operating costs, the dynamics and control of these reactors may be complex. We next examine an ammonia synthesis example to show that multiple steady states are possible. Ammonia synthesis had a large impact on the early development of the chemical engineering discipline. Quoting Aftalion [1, p. 101] 125 / 149 Early Days of Chemical Engineering While physicists and chemists were linking up to understand the structure of matter and giving birth to physical chemistry , another discipline was emerging, particularly in the United States, at the beginning of the twentieth century, that of chemical engineering . . . it was undoubtedly the synthesis of ammonia by BASF, successfully achieved in 1913 in Oppau, which forged the linking of chemistry with physics and engineering as it required knowledge in areas of analysis, equilibrium reactions, high pressures, catalysis, resistance of materials, and design of large- scale apparatus. 126 / 149Ammonia synthesis I Example 6.6: Ammonia synthesis Calculate the steady-state conversion for the synthesis of ammonia using the autothermal process shown previously A rate expression for the reaction N2+3H2k1 k12NH 3 over an iron catalyst at 300 atm pressure is suggested by Temkin [4] r=k1/RT/bracketleftigg K2(T)PNP3/2 H PAPA P3/2 H/bracketrightigg in which PN,PH,PAare the partial pressures of nitrogen, hydrogen, and ammonia, respectively, and Kis the equilibrium constant for the reaction forming one mole of ammonia. For illustration, we assume the thermochemical properties are constant and the gases form an ideal-gas mixture. More accurate thermochemical properties and a more accurate equation of state do not affect the fundamental behavior predicted by the reactor model. 127 / 149 Ammonia synthesis II The steady-state material balance for the ammonia is dNA dV=RA= 2r NA(0) = NAf and the other molar flows are calculated from NN=NNf1/2(NANAf) NH=NHf3/2(NANAf) If we assume an ideal gas in this temperature and pressure range, the volumetric flowrate is given by Q=RT P(NA+NN+NH) The energy balance for the reactor is the usual QCPdT dV=HRr+ q (6.55) in which qis the heat transfer taking place between the reacting fluid and the cold feed q=2 RUo(TaT) 128 / 149Ammonia synthesis III Parameter Value Units P 300 atm Q0 0.16 m3/s Ac 1 m2 l 12 m for ammonia example 129 / 149 Ammonia synthesis IV The material balances for the feed-heating section are simple because reaction does not take place without the catalyst. Without reaction, the molar flow of all species are constant and equal to their feed values and the energy balance for the feed-heating section is QaaCPadTa dVa=q (6.56) Ta(0) = Taf in which the subscript arepresents the fluid in the feed-heating section. Notice the heat terms are of opposite signs in Equations 6.56 and 6.55. If we assume the fluid properties do not change significantly over the temperature range of interest, and switch the direction of integration in Equation 6.56 using dVa=dV, we obtain QCPdTa dV= q Ta(VR) =Taf (6.58) Finally we require a boundary condition for the reactor energy balance, which we have from the fact that the heating fluid enters the reactor at z= 0,T(0) = Ta(0). 130 / 149Ammonia synthesis V Combining these balances and boundary conditions and converting to reactor length in place of volume gives the model dNA dz= 2Acr N A(0) = boundary-value problem, rather than an initial-value problem, because Tais specified at the exit of the reactor. A simple solution strategy is to guess the reactor inlet temperature, solve the model to the exit of the reactor, and then compare the computed feed preheat temperature to the specified value Taf. This strategy is known as a shooting method. We guess the missing values required to produce an initial-value problem. We solve the initial-value problem, and then iterate on the guessed values until we match the specified boundary conditions. We will see more about boundary-value problems and shooting methods when we treat diffusion in Chapter 7. 2 131 / 149 Solution I Figure 6.38 shows the results for the parameter values listed in Table 6.6, which are based on those used by van Heerden [6]. For given values of Ta(0), we solve the initial-value problem, Equation 6.59, and plot the resulting Ta(VR) as the solid line in Figure 6.38. The intersection of that line with the feed temperature Taf= 323 Kindicates a steady-state solution. Notice three steady-state solutions are indicated in Figure 6.38 for these values of parameters. 132 / 149Solution II 0100200300400500600700 200 300 400 500 600 700 800 900 1000T(K) A B C TafTa(l) Ta(0)(K) 133 / 149 Solution III Figure 6.38: Coolant temperature at reactor outlet versus temperature at reactor inlet, Ta(l) versus Ta(0); intersection with coolant feed temperature Tafindicates three steady-state solutions (A,B,C). The profiles in the reactor for these three steady states are shown in Figures 6.39 and 6.40. It is important to operate at the upper steady state so that a reasonably large production of ammonia is achieved. 134 / 1493004005006007008009001000 0 2 4 6 8 10 12T,TaTaTTaT ABC T(K) z(m) Figure 6.39: Reactor and coolant temperature profiles versus reactor length; lower (A), unstable middle (B), and upper (C) steady states. 135 / 149 00.050.10.150.20.25 0 2 4 6 8 10 12xA ABC z(m) Figure 6.40: Ammonia mole fraction versus reactor length; lower (A), unstable middle (B), and upper (C) steady states. 136 / 149Summary Tables 6.7-6.10 summarize the important energy balances for the batch, continuous-stirred-tank, semi-batch, and plug-flow reactors. In contrast to the material balance, which is reasonably straightforward, choosing the proper energy balance requires some care. It is unwise to select an energy balance from a book without carefully considering the assumptions that have been made in the derivation of that particular energy balance.

For the batch, semi-batch, and steady-state plug-flow reactors, these balances are sets of initial-value ODEs that must be solved numerically. In very limited situations (constant thermodynamic properties, single reaction, adiabatic), one can solve the energy balance to get an algebraic relation between temperature and concentration or molar flowrate. The nonlinear nature of the energy and material balances can lead to multiple steady-state solutions. Steady-state solutions may be unstable, and the reactor can exhibit sustained oscillations. These reactor behaviors were illustrated with exothermic CSTRs and autothermal tubular reactors. 144 / 149Notation I A heat transfer area Ac reactor tube cross-sectional area Aipreexponential factor for rate constant i cjconcentration of species j cjffeed concentration of species j cjssteady-state concentration of species j cj0initial concentration of species j CPconstant-pressure heat capacity CPjpartial molar heat capacity CPsheat capacity per volume CPconstant-pressure heat capacity per mass CVconstant-volume heat capacity per mass CPheat capacity change on reaction, CP=/summationtext jjCPj Eiactivation energy for rate constant i Ektotal energy of stream k Ektotal energy per mass of stream k GGibbs energy change on reaction at standard conditions Hjpartial molar enthalpy H enthalpy per unit mass HRienthalpy change on reaction, HRi=/summationtext jijHj Henthalpy change on reaction at standard conditions kireaction rate constant for reaction i km reaction rate constant evaluated at mean temperature Tm Kiequilibrium constant for reaction i K kinetic energy per unit mass l tubular reactor length mktotal mass flow of stream k 145 / 149 Notation II n reaction order njmoles of species j,VRcj nr number of reactions in the reaction network ns number of species in the reaction network Njmolar flow of species j,Qcj Njffeed molar flow of species j,Qcj P pressure Pjpartial pressure of component j q heat transfer rate per volume for tubular reactor, q=2 RUo(TaT) Q volumetric flowrate Qffeed volumetric flowrate Q rate to reactor, usually modeled as Q=UoA(TaT) rireaction rate for ith reaction rtot total reaction rate,/summationtext iri R gas constant Rjproduction rate for jth species t time T temperature Ta temperature of heat transfer medium Tm mean temperature at which kis evaluated Uooverall heat transfer coefficient U internal energy per mass vkvelocity of stream k V reactor volume variable Vjpartial molar volume of species j V jspecific molar volume of species j VRreactor volume 146 / 149Notation III Vichange in volume upon reaction i,/summationtext jijVj W rate work is done on the system xjnumber of molecules of species jin a stochastic simulation xjmolar conversion of species j yjmole fraction of gas-phase species j z reactor length variable coefficient of expansion of the mixture, = (1/V)(V/T)P,nj iextent of reaction i reactor residence time, =VR/Qf ijstoichiometric coefficient for species jin reaction i \u00afi/summationtext jij mass density kmass density of stream k potential energy per mass 147 / 149 Thermodynamics Summary 1:=1 149References I F.
