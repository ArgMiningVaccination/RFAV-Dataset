The chemical designation is N-amidino-2-(2,6dichlorophenyl) acetamide monohydrochloride. The molecular formula is C9H9Cl2 N3OHCl corresponding to a molecular weight of 282.55. The chemical structure is: Guanfacine HCl is a white to off-white crystalline powder, sparingly soluble in water (approximately 1 mg/mL) and alcohol and slightly soluble in acetone. The only organic solvent in which it has relatively high solubility is methanol (>30 mg/mL). Each tablet contains guanfacine HCl equivalent to 1 mg, 2 mg, 3 mg, or 4 mg of guanfacine base. The tablets also contain hypromellose, methacrylic acid In addition, the 3-mg and 4-mg tablets also contain green pigment blend PB-1763. INDICATIONS INTUNIV\u00ae is indicated for the treatment of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) as monotherapy and as adjunctive therapy to stimulant medications [see Clinical Studies]. DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION General Instruction For Use Swallow tablets whole. Do not crush, chew, or break tablets because this will increase the rate of guanfacine release. Do not administer with high fat meals, due to increased exposure. Dose Selection Take INTUNIV orally once daily, either in the morning or evening, at approximately the same time each day. Begin at a dose of 1mg/day, and adjust in increments of no more than 1 mg/week. In monotherapy clinical trials, there was dose- and exposure-related clinical improvement as well as risks for several clinically significant adverse reactions (hypotension, bradycardia, sedative events). To balance the exposure-related potential benefits and risks, the recommended target dose range depending on clinical response and tolerability for INTUNIV\u00ae is 0.05-0.12 mg/kg/day(total daily dose between 1-7 mg) (See Table 1). Table 1: Recommended Target Dose Range for Therapy with INTUNIV\u00ae |Weight||Target dose range have not been evaluated in children (ages 6-12 years) and doses above 7mg/day have not been evaluated in adolescents (ages 13-17 years) In the adjunctive trial which evaluated INTUNIV\u00ae treatment with psychostimulants, the majority of patients reached optimal doses in the 0.05-0.12 mg/kg/day range. Doses above 4 mg/day have not been studied in adjunctive trials. Switching From Immediate-Release Guanfacine To INTUNIV\u00ae If switching from immediate-release guanfacine, discontinue that treatment, and titrate with INTUNIV\u00ae following abovere commended schedule. Do not substitute for immediate-release guanfacine tablets on a milligram-per-milligram basis, because of differing pharmacokinetic profiles. INTUNIV\u00ae has significantly reduced Cmax (60% lower), bioavailability (43% lower), and a delayed Tmax (3 hours later) compared to those of the same dose of immediate-release guanfacine [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY]. Maintenance Treatment Pharmacological treatment of ADHD may be needed for extended periods. Healthcare providers should periodically re-evaluate the long-term use of INTUNIV\u00ae, and adjust weight-based dosage as needed. The majority of children and adolescents reach optimal doses in the 0.05-0.12 mg/kg/day range. Doses above 4 mg/day have not been evaluated in children (ages 6-12 years) and above 7 mg/day have not been evaluated in adolescents (ages 13-17 years) [see Clinical Studies]. Discontinuation Of Treatment Following discontinuation of INTUNIV\u00ae, patients may experience increases in blood pressure and heart rate [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS and ADVERSE REACTIONS]. Patients/caregivers should be instructed not to discontinue INTUNIV\u00ae without consulting their health care provider. Monitor blood pressure and pulse when reducing the dose or discontinuing the drug. Taper the daily dose in decrements of no more than 1 mg every 3 to 7 days to minimize the risk of rebound hypertension. Missed Doses When reinitiating patients to the previous maintenance dose after two or more missed consecutive doses, consider titration based on patient tolerability. Dosage Adjustment With Concomitant Use Of Strong And Moderate CYP3A4 Inhibitors Or Inducers Dosage adjustments for INTUNIV\u00ae are recommended with concomitant use of strong and moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole) or CYP3A4 inducers (e.g., carbamazepine) (Table 2) [see DRUG INTERACTIONS].

Revised: Aug 2020 SIDE EFFECTS The following serious adverse reactions are described elsewhere in the labeling: - Hypotension, bradycardia, and PRECAUTIONS] - Cardiac conduction abnormalities [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS] - Rebound Hypertension [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS] Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The data described below reflect clinical trial exposure to INTUNIV\u00ae in 2,825 patients. This includes 2,330 patients from completed studies in children and adolescents, ages 6 to 17 years and 495 patients in completed studies in adult healthy volunteers. The mean duration of exposure of 446 patients that previously participated in two 2-year, open-label long-term studies was approximately 10 months.

Effects On Blood Pressure And Heart Rate In the monotherapy pediatric, short-term, controlled trials (Studies 1 and 2), the maximum mean changes from baseline in seated systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, and pulse were -5.4 mmHg, -3.4 mmHg, and -5.5 bpm, respectively, for all doses combined (generally one week after reaching target doses). For the respective fixed doses 1 mg/day, 2 mg/day, 3 mg/day or 4 mg/day the maximum mean changes in seated blood -4.3 mmHg, -5.5 mmHg, -5.4 mmHg and -8.2mmHg. For these respective fixed doses the maximum mean changes in seated diastolic blood pressure were -3.4 mmHg, -3.3mmHg, -4.4 mmHg and -5.4 mmHg. For these respective fixed doses the maximum mean changes in seated pulse were -4.8 bpm,-3.1 bpm, -6.5 bpm and -8.6 bpm. Decreases in blood pressure and heart rate were usually modest and asymptomatic; however, hypotension and bradycardia can occur. Hypotension was reported as an adverse reaction for 7% of the INTUNIV\u00ae group and 3%of the placebo group. This includes orthostatic hypotension, which was reported for 1% of the INTUNIV\u00ae group and none in the placebo group. These findings were generally similar in the monotherapy flexible dose trials (Studies 4 and 5). In the adjunctive trial, hypotension (3%) and bradycardia (2%) were observed in patients treated with INTUNIV\u00ae as compared to none in the placebo group. In long-term, open-label studies, (mean exposure of approximately 10 months), maximum decreases in systolic and diastolic blood pressure occurred in the first month of therapy. Decreases were less pronounced over time. Syncope occurred in 1% of pediatric patients in the clinical program. The majority of these cases occurred in the long-term, open-label studies. Discontinuation Of Treatment Blood pressure and pulse may increase above baseline values following discontinuation of INTUNIV\u00ae. In five studies of children and adolescents [see Clinical Studies], increases in mean systolic and diastolic blood pressure averaging approximately 3mmHg and increases in heart rate averaging 5 beats per minute above original baseline were observed upon discontinuation with tapering of INTUNIV+. In a maintenance of efficacy study, increases in blood pressure and heart rate above baseline slowly diminished over the follow up period, which ranged between 3 and 26 weeks post final dose; the estimated average time to return to baseline was between six and twelve months. In this study, the increases in blood pressure and pulse were not considered serious or associated with adverse events. However, individuals may have larger increases than reflected by the mean changes. In postmarketing experience, following abrupt discontinuation of INTUNIV\u00ae, rebound hypertension and hypertensive encephalopathy have been reported [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS and ADVERSE REACTIONS]. Effects On Height, Weight, And Body Mass Index (BMI) Patients taking INTUNIV\u00ae demonstrated similar growth compared to normative data. Patients taking INTUNIV\u00ae had a mean increase in weight of 0.5 kg compared to those receiving placebo over a comparable treatment period. Patients receiving INTUNIV for at least 12 months in open-label studies gained an average of 8 kg in weight and 8 cm (3 in) in height. The height, weight, and BMI percentile remained stable in patients at 12 months in the long-term studies compared to when they began receiving INTUNIV\u00ae. Other Adverse Reactions Observed in Clinical Studies Table 13 includes additional adverse reactions observed in short-term, placebo-controlled and long-term, open-label clinical studies not included elsewhere in section 6.1, listed by organ system. Table 13: Other adverse reactions observed in clinical reactions have been identified during post-approval use of guanfacine. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Less frequent, possibly guanfacine-related events observed in the post-marketing study and/or reported spontaneously, not included in section 6.1, include: General: edema, malaise, tremor Cardiovascular: pain, myalgia Psychiatric: Reproductive System, Male: Special Senses: alterations in taste DRUG INTERACTIONS Table 14 contains clinically important drug interactions with INTUNIV\u00ae [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY] Table 14: Clinically Important Drug Interactions: Effect of other Drugs on INTUNIV\u00ae |Concomitant Drug Name or Drug Class||Clinical Rationale and Magnitude of Drug Interaction||Clinical Recommendation| |Strong and moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors, e.g., ketoconazole, fluconazole||Guanfacine is primarily metabolized by CYP3A4 and its plasma concentrations can be significantly affected resulting in an increase in exposure||Consider dose reduction [see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION]| |Strong and moderate inducers, e.g., rifampin, efavirenz||Guanfacine is primarily metabolized by CYP3A4 and its plasma concentrations can be significantly affected resulting in a decrease in exposure||Consider dose increase [see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION]| WARNINGS Included as part of the PRECAUTIONS section. PRECAUTIONS Hypotension, Bradycardia, And Syncope Treatment with INTUNIV\u00ae can cause dose-dependent decreases in blood pressure and heart rate. Decreases were less pronounced over time of treatment. Orthostatic hypotension and syncope have been reported [see ADVERSE REACTIONS]. Measure heart rate and blood pressure prior to initiation of therapy, following dose increases, and periodically while on therapy. Titrate INTUNIV slowly in patients with a history of hypotension, and those with underlying conditions that may be worsened by hypotension and bradycardia; e.g., heart block, bradycardia, cardiovascular disease, vascular disease, cerebrovascular disease, or chronic renal failure. In patients who have a history of syncope or may have a condition that predisposes them to syncope, such as hypotension, orthostatic hypotension, bradycardia, or dehydration, advise patients to avoid becoming dehydrated or overheated. Monitor blood pressure and heart rate, and adjust dosages accordingly in patients treated concomitantly with antihypertensives or other drugs that can reduce blood pressure or heart rate or increase the risk of syncope. Sedation and Somnolence Somnolence and sedation were commonly reported adverse reactions in clinical studies [see ADVERSE REACTIONS]. Before using INTUNIV\u00ae with other centrally active depressants, consider the potential for additive sedative effects. Caution patients against operating heavy equipment or driving until they know how they respond to treatment with INTUNIV. Advise patients to avoid use with alcohol. Cardiac Conduction Abnormalities The sympatholytic action of INTUNIV\u00ae may worsen sinus node dysfunction and atrioventricular (AV) block, especially inpatients taking other sympatholytic drugs. Titrate INTUNIV slowly and monitor vital signs frequently in patients with cardiac conduction abnormalities or patients concomitantly treated with other sympatholytic drugs. Rebound Hypertension In post marketing experience, abrupt discontinuation of INTUNIV\u00ae has resulted in clinically significant and persistent rebound hypertension above baseline levels and increases in heart rate. Hypertensive encephalopathy has also been reported in association with rebound hypertension with both INTUNIV\u00ae and immediate release guanfacine [see ADVERSE REACTIONS]. In these cases, high-dosage guanfacine was discontinued; concomitant stimulant use was also reported, which may potentially increase hypertensive response upon abrupt discontinuation of guanfacine. Children commonly have gastrointestinal illnesses that lead to vomiting, and a resulting inability to take medications, so they may be especially at risk for rebound hypertension. To minimize the risk of rebound hypertension upon discontinuation, the total daily dose of INTUNIV\u00ae should be tapered in decrements of no more than 1 mg every 3 to 7 days [see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION]. Blood pressure and heart rate should be monitored when reducing the dose or discontinuing INTUNIV. If abrupt discontinuation occurs (especially with concomitant stimulant use), patients should be closely followed for rebound hypertension. Patient Counseling Information Advise the patient to read the FDA-approved patient labeling (PATIENT INFORMATION). Dosing And Administration Instruct patients to swallow INTUNIV\u00ae whole with water, milk or other liquid. Tablets should not be crushed, chewed or broken prior to administration because this may increase the rate of release of the active drug. Patients should not take INTUNIV\u00ae together with a high-fat meal, since this can raise blood levels of INTUNIV\u00ae. Instruct the parent or caregiver to supervise the child or adolescent taking INTUNIV\u00ae and to keep the bottle of tablets out of reach of children. Advise patients not to abruptly discontinue INTUNIV\u00ae as abrupt discontinuation can result in clinically significant rebound hypertension. Concomitant stimulant use and abrupt discontinuation of Intuniv may increase this hypertensive response. Instruct patients on how to properly taper the dose to minimize the risk of rebound hypertension [see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION and WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS]. Adverse Reactions Advise patients that sedation can occur, particularly early in treatment or with dose increases. Caution against operating heavy equipment or driving until they know how they respond to treatment with INTUNIV\u00ae \u00c2 [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS].Headache and abdominal pain can also occur. If any of these symptoms persist, or other symptoms occur, the patient should be advised to discuss the symptoms with the health care provider. Advise patients to avoid becoming dehydrated or overheated, which may potentially increase the risks of hypotension and syncope [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS]. Advise patients to avoid use with alcohol. Pregnancy Registry Advise patients that there is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in patients exposed to INTUNIV during pregnancy [see Use In Specific Populations]. Lactation Advise breastfeeding mothers to monitor infants exposed to guanfacine through breast milk for sedation, lethargy and poor feeding[see Use In Specific Populations]. Nonclinical Toxicology Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment Of Fertility Carcinogenesis No carcinogenic effect of guanfacine was observed in studies of 78 weeks in mice or 102 weeks in rats at doses up to 6.8 times the maximum recommended human dose of 0.12 mg/kg/day on a mg/m\u00b2 basis. Mutagenesis Guanfacine was not genotoxic in a variety of test models, including the Ames test and an in vitro chromosomal aberration test;however, a marginal increase in numerical aberrations (polyploidy) was observed in the latter study. Impairment Of Fertility No adverse effects were observed in fertility studies in male and female rats at doses up to 22 times the maximum recommended human dose on a mg/m\u00b2 basis. Use In Specific Populations Pregnancy Pregnancy Exposure Registry There is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to ADHD medications, including INTUNIV, during pregnancy. Healthcare providers are encouraged to register patients by calling the National Pregnancy Registry for ADHD Medications at 1-866-961-2388. Risk Summary Available data with guanfacine over decades of use in pregnant women have not identified a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. However, use of guanfacine in pregnant women over this time has been infrequent. In animal reproduction studies, rabbits and rats exposed to 3 and 4 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD), respectively, showed no adverse outcomes. However, higher doses were associated with reduced fetal survival and maternal toxicity (See Data). The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data Reproduction studies conducted in rats have shown that guanfacine crosses the placenta. However, administration of guanfacine to rabbits and rats during organogenesis at 3 (rabbit) and 4 (rat) times the MRHD of 0.12 mg/kg/day on a mg/m\u00b2 basis resulted in no evidence of harm to the fetus. Higher doses (13.5 times the MRHD in both rabbits and rats) were associated with reduced fetal survival and maternal toxicity. Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of guanfacine in human milk or the effects on the breastfed infant. The effects on milk production are also unknown. Guanfacine is present in the milk of lactating rats (see Data ). If a drug is present in animal milk, it is likely that the drug will be present in human milk. If an infant is exposed to guanfacine through breast milk, monitor for symptoms of hypotension and bradycardia such as sedation, lethargy and poor feeding (see Clinical Considerations). The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for INTUNIV and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from INTUNIV or from the underlying maternal condition. Clinical Considerations Monitor breastfeeding infants exposed to guanfacine through breast milk for sedation, lethargy, and poor feeding. Data Guanfacine was excreted in breast milk of lactating rats at a concentration comparable to that observed in blood, but slightly less than the concentration in plasma when administered following a single oral dose of 5 mg/kg. The concentration of drug in animal milk does not necessarily predict the concentration of drug in human milk. Pediatric Use Safety And efficacy Of INTUNIV\u00ae in pediatric patients less than 6 years of age have not been established. The efficacy of INTUNIV\u00ae was studied for the treatment of ADHD in five controlled monotherapy clinical trials (up to 15 weeks in duration),one randomized withdrawal study and one controlled adjunctive trial with psychostimulants (8 weeks in duration) in children and adolescents ages 6-17 who met DSM-IV\u00ae criteria for ADHD [see ADVERSE REACTIONS and Clinical Studies]. Animal Data In studies in juvenile rats, guanfacine alone produced a slight delay in sexual maturation in males and females at 2 to 3 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD). Guanfacine in combination with methylphenidate produced a slight delay in sexual maturation and decreased growth as measured by a decrease in bone length in males at a dose of guanfacine comparable to the MRHD and a dose of methylphenidate approximately 4 times the MRHD. In a study where juvenile rats were treated with guanfacine alone from 7 to 59 days of age, development was delayed as indicated by a slight delay in sexual maturation and decreased body weight gain in males at 2 mg/kg/day and in females at 3 mg/kg/day. The No Adverse Effect Level (NOAEL) for delayed sexual maturation was 1 mg/kg/day, which is equivalent to the MRHD of 4mg/day, on a mg/m\u00b2 basis. The effects on fertility were not evaluated in this study. In a study where juvenile rats were treated with guanfacine in combination with methylphenidate from 7 to 59 days of age, a decrease in ulna bone length and a slight delay in sexual maturation were observed in males given 1 mg/kg/day of guanfacine in combination with 50 mg/kg/day of methylphenidate. The NOAELs for these findings were 0.3 mg/kg of guanfacine in combination with 16 mg/kg/day of methylphenidate, which are equivalent to 0.3 and 1.4 times the MRHD of 4 mg/day and 54mg/day for guanfacine and methylphenidate, respectively, on a mg/m\u00b2 basis. These findings were not observed with guanfacine alone at 1 mg/kg/day or methylphenidate alone at 50 mg/kg/day. Geriatric Use The safety and efficacy of INTUNIV\u00ae in geriatric patients have not been established. Renal Impairment It may be necessary to reduce the dosage in patients with significant impairment of renal function [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY]. Hepatic Impairment It may be necessary to reduce the dosage in patients with significant impairment of hepatic function [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY]. Drug Abuse And Dependence Controlled Substance INTUNIV\u00ae is not a controlled substance and has no known potential for abuse or dependence. OVERDOSE Symptoms Postmarketing reports of guanfacine over dosage indicate that hypotension, drowsiness, lethargy, and bradycardia have been observed following overdose. Initial hypertension may develop early and may be followed by hypotension. Similar symptoms have been described in voluntary reports to the American Association of Poison Control Center's National Poison Data System. Miosis of the pupils may be noted on examination. No fatal overdoses of guanfacine have been reported in published literature. Treatment Consult a Certified Poison Control Center by calling 1-800-222-1222 for up-to-date guidance and advice. Management of INTUNIV\u00ae overdose should include monitoring for and the treatment of initial hypertension, if that occurs, as well as hypotension, bradycardia, lethargy and respiratory depression. Children and adolescents who develop lethargy should be observed for the development of more serious toxicity including coma, bradycardia and hypotension for up to 24 hours, due to the possibility of delayed onset hypotension. CONTRAINDICATIONS INTUNIV is contraindicated in patients with a history of a hypersensitivity reaction to INTUNIV or its inactive ingredients, or other products containing guanfacine. Rash and pruritus have been reported. CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Mechanism Of Action Guanfacine is a central alpha2A-adrenergic receptor agonist. Guanfacine is not a central nervous system (CNS) stimulant. The mechanism of action of guanfacine in ADHD is not known. Pharmacodynamics Guanfacine is a selective central alpha2A-adrenergic receptor agonist in that it has a 15-20 times higher affinity for this receptor subtype than for the alpha 2Bor alpha 2Csubtypes. Guanfacine is a known antihypertensive agent. By stimulating central alpha2A-adrenergic receptors, guanfacine reduces sympathetic nerve impulses from the vasomotor center to the heart and blood vessels. This results in a decrease in peripheral vascular resistance and a reduction in heart rate. In a thorough QT study, the administration of two dose levels of immediate-release guanfacine (4 mg and 8 mg) produced concentrations approximately 2 to 4 times the concentrations observed with the maximum recommended dose of INTUNIV \u00aeof0.12 mg/kg. Guanfacine was not shown to prolong the QTc interval to any clinically relevant extent. Pharmacokinetics Absorption And Distribution Guanfacine is readily absorbed and approximately 70% bound to plasma proteins independent of drug concentration. After oral administration of INTUNIV\u00ae the time to peak plasma concentration is approximately 5 hours in children and adolescents with ADHD. Immediate-release guanfacine and INTUNIV\u00ae have different pharmacokinetic characteristics; dose substitution on a milligram per milligram basis will result in differences in exposure. A comparison across studies suggests that the Cmax is 60% lower and AUC0- 43% lower, respectively, for INTUNIV\u00ae compared to immediate-release relative to immediate-release guanfacine is 58%.The mean pharmacokinetic parameters in adults following the administration of INTUNIV\u00ae 1 mg once daily and immediate-release guanfacine 1mg once daily are summarized in Table 15. Table 15: Comparison of Pharmacokinetics: INTUNIV\u00ae vs. Immediate release Guanfacinein Adults |Parameter||INTUNIV\u00ae 1 mg once daily | (n=52) |Immediate-release except for tmax which is median (range)| Figure 1: Comparison of Pharmacokinetics: INTUNIV\u00ae vs. Immediate-release guanfacine in Adults Exposure to guanfacine was higher in children (ages 6-12) compared to adolescents (ages 13-17) and adults. After oral administration of multiple doses of INTUNIV\u00ae 4 mg, the Cmax was 10 ng/mL compared to 7 ng/mL and the AUC was 162ngh/mL compared to 116 ngh/mL in children (ages 6-12) and adolescents (ages 13-17), respectively. These differences are probably attributable to the lower body weight of children compared to adolescents and adults. The pharmacokinetics were affected by intake of food when a single dose of INTUNIV\u00ae 4 mg was administered with a high-fat breakfast. The mean exposure increased (Cmax ~75% and AUC ~40%) compared to dosing in a fasted state. Dose Proportionality Following administration of INTUNIV\u00ae in single doses of 1 mg, 2 mg, 3 mg, and 4 mg to adults, Cmax and AUC0- of guanfacine were proportional to dose. Metabolism And Elimination In vitro studies with human liver microsomes and [recombinant](https://www.rxlist.com/recombinant/definition.htm) CYP's demonstrated that guanfacine was primarily metabolized byCYP3A4. In pooled human hepatic microsomes, guanfacine did not inhibit and CYP2B6. Guanfacine is a substrate of and exposure is affected by CYP3A4/5inducers/inhibitors. Guanfacine inhibits MATE1 substrates might potentially increase the exposure of these OCT1substrates. Studies In Specific Populations Renal Impairment The impact of renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of guanfacine in children was not assessed. In adult patients with impaired renal function, the cumulative urinary excretion of guanfacine and the renal clearance diminished as renal function decreased. In patients on [hemodialysis](https://www.rxlist.com/hemodialysis/definition.htm), the [dialysis](https://www.rxlist.com/dialysis/definition.htm) clearance was about 15% of the total clearance. The low dialysis clearance suggests that the hepatic elimination ( [metabolism](https://www.rxlist.com/metabolism/definition.htm)) increases as renal function decreases. Hepatic Impairment The impact of hepatic impairment on PK of guanfacine in children was not assessed. Guanfacine in adults is cleared both by the liver and the kidney, and approximately 50% of the clearance of guanfacine is hepatic [see Hepatic Impairment]. Drug Interaction Studies Guanfacine is primarily metabolized by CYP3A4 and its plasma concentrations can be affected significantly by CYP3A4inhibitors or inducers (Figure 2). Figure 2: Effect of Other Drugs on the Pharmacokinetics (PK) of INTUNIV\u00ae Guanfacine does not significantly affect exposures of methylphenidate and lisdexamfetamine when co administered (Figure 3). Figure 3: Effect of INTUNIV\u00ae on the Pharmacokinetics (PK) of Other Drugs Clinical Studies Efficacy of INTUNIV\u00ae in the treatment of [ADHD](https://www.rxlist.com/adhd_attention_deficit_hyperactivity_disorder/definition.htm) was established in children and adolescents (6 to 17 years) in: - Five short-term, placebo-controlled monotherapy trials (Studies 1, 2, 4, 5, and 6). - One short-term, placebo-controlled adjunctive trial with psychostimulants (Study 3). - One long-term, placebo-controlled monotherapy maintenance trial (Study 7). Studies 1 And 2: Fixed-Dose INTUNIV\u00ae Monotherapy Study 1 (301 study) was a double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, fixed-dose study, in which efficacy of once daily dosing with INTUNIV\u00ae (2 mg, 3 mg and 4 mg) was evaluated for 5 weeks (n=345) in children and adolescents aged 6-17 years. Study 2 (304 study) was a double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, fixed-dose study, in which efficacy of once daily dosing with INTUNIV\u00ae (1 mg, 2 mg, 3 mg and 4 mg) was evaluated for 6 weeks (n=324) in children and adolescents aged 6-17years. In both studies, randomized patients in 2 mg, 3 mg and 4 mg dose groups were titrated to their target fixed dose, and continued on the same dose until a dose tapering phase started. The lowest dose of 1 mg used in Study 2 was not randomized to patients weighing more than 50 kg. Patients who weighed less than 25 kg were not included in either study. Signs and symptoms of ADHD were evaluated on a once weekly basis using the clinician administered and scored ADHD Rating Scale (ADHD-RS-IV), which includes both hyperactive/impulsive and inattentive subscales. The primary efficacy outcome was the change from baseline to endpoint in ADHD-RS-IV total scores. Endpoint was defined as the last post- [randomization](https://www.rxlist.com/randomization/definition.htm) treatment week for which a valid score was obtained prior to dose tapering (up to Week 5 in Study 1 and up to Week 6 in Study 2). The mean reductions in ADHD-RS-IV total scores at endpoint were statistically significantly greater for INTUNIV\u00ae compared to placebo for Studies 1 and 2. Placebo-adjusted changes from baseline were statistically significant for each of the 2 mg, 3 mg, and 4 mg INTUNIV\u00ae randomized treatment groups in both studies, as well as the 1 mg INTUNIV\u00ae \u00c2 treatment group that was included only in Study 2 (see Table 16). Dose-responsive efficacy was evident, particularly when data were examined on a weight-adjusted (mg/kg) basis. When evaluated over the dose range of 0.01-0.17 mg/kg/day, clinically relevant improvements were observed beginning at doses in the range 0.05-0.08 mg/kg/day. Doses up to 0.12 mg/kg/day were shown to provide additional benefit. In the monotherapy trials (Studies 1 and 2), subgroup analyses were performed to identify any differences in response based on gender or age (6-12 vs. 13-17). Analyses of the primary outcome did not suggest any differential responsiveness on the basis of gender. Analyses by age revealed a statistically significant treatment effect only in the 6-12 age subgroup. Due to the relatively small proportion of adolescent patients (ages 13-17) enrolled into these studies (approximately 25%), these data may not have been sufficient to demonstrate efficacy in the adolescent patients. In these studies, patients were randomized to a fixed dose of INTUNIV\u00ae rather than optimized by body weight. Therefore, some adolescent patients were randomized to a dose that might have resulted in relatively lower plasma guanfacine concentrations compared to the younger patients. Over half (55%) of the adolescent patients received doses of 0.01-0.04 mg/kg. In studies in which systematic pharmacokinetic data were obtained, there was a strong inverse correlation between body weight and plasma guanfacine concentrations. Table 16: Fixed dose Studies interval. | *Difference (drug minus placebo) in least-squares mean change from baseline. Doses statistically significantly superior to placebo. The lowest dose of 1 mg used in Study 2 was not randomized to patients weighing more than 50 kg. Study 3: Flexible-Dose INTUNIV\u00ae As Adjunctive Therapy To Psychostimulants Study 3 (313 study) was a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, dose-optimization study, in which efficacy of once daily optimized dosing (morning or evening) with INTUNIV\u00ae (1 mg, 2 mg, 3 mg and 4 mg), when co-administered with psychostimulants, was evaluated for 8 weeks, in children and adolescents aged 6-17 years with a diagnosis of ADHD, with a sub-optimal response to stimulants (n=455). Patients were started at the 1 mg INTUNIV\u00ae dose level and were titrated weekly over a5-week dose-optimization period to an optimal INTUNIV\u00ae dose not to exceed 4 mg/day based on tolerability and clinical response. The dose was then maintained for a 3-week dose maintenance period before entry to 1 week of dose tapering. Patients took INTUNIV\u00ae either in the morning or the evening while maintaining their current dose of psychostimulant treatment given each morning. Allowable psychostimulants in Symptoms of ADHD were evaluated on a weekly basis by clinicians using the ADHD Rating Scale (ADHD-RS-IV), which includes both hyperactive/impulsive and inattentive subscales. The primary efficacy outcome was the change from baseline to endpoint in ADHD-RS-IV total scores. Endpoint was defined as the last post-randomization treatment week prior to dose tapering for which a valid score was obtained (up to Week 8). Mean reductions in ADHD-RS-IV total scores at endpoint were statistically significantly greater for INTUNIV\u00ae given in combination with a psychostimulant compared to placebo given with a psychostimulant for Study 3, for both morning and evening INTUNIV\u00ae dosing (see Table 17). Nearly two-thirds (64.2%) of patients reached optimal doses in the 0.05-0.12mg/kg/day range. Studies 4, 5 And 6: Flexible-dose INTUNIV\u00ae randomized, placebo-controlled, dose-optimization study, in which efficacy of once daily dosing (morning or evening) with INTUNIV\u00ae (1 mg, 2 mg, 3 mg, and 4 mg) was evaluated for 8 weeks in children aged 6-12years (n=340). Signs and symptoms of ADHD were evaluated on a once weekly basis using the clinician administered and scored ADHD Rating Scale (ADHD-RS-IV), which includes both hyperactive/impulsive and inattentive subscales. The primary efficacy outcome was the change from baseline score at endpoint on the ADHD-RS-IV total scores. Endpoint was defined as the last post-randomization treatment week for which a valid score was obtained prior to dose tapering (up to Week 8). Mean reductions in ADHD-RS-IV total scores at endpoint were statistically significantly greater for INTUNIV\u00ae compared to placebo in both AM and PM dosing groups of INTUNIV\u00ae (see Table 17). Study 5 (312 study) was a 15-week, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, dose-optimization study conducted in adolescents aged 13-17 years (n=314) to evaluate the efficacy and safety of INTUNIV\u00ae (1-7 mg/day; optimized dose range of0.05-0.12 mg/kg/day) in the treatment of ADHD as measured by the ADHD Rating Scale-IV (ADHD-RS-IV). Patients receiving INTUNIV\u00ae showed statistically significantly greater improvement on the ADHD-RS-IV total score compared with patients receiving placebo (see Table 17). Study 6 (316 study) was a 12-week (for children aged 6-12) or 15-week and active-reference, dose-optimization study conducted in pediatric patients (children and adolescents aged 6-17 years old inclusive) (n=337) to assess the efficacy of once-daily dosing (children: 1-4 mg/day, adolescents:1-7 mg/day; optimized dose range to 0.12 mg/kg/day) in the treatment of ADHD. INTUNIV\u00ae was statistically superior to placebo on symptoms of ADHD in patients 6-17 years as measured by change from baseline in ADHD-RS-IV total scores (see Table 17). Table 17: interval. | *Difference (drug minus placebo) in least-squares mean change from baseline. Treatment was given in combination with a psychostimulant. Doses statistically significantly superior to placebo. Study 7: Long-Term Maintenance Of INTUNIV Efficacy Study 7 (315 study) was a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized withdrawal trial in pediatric patients aged 6 to 17 years with DSM-IV-TR diagnosis of ADHD. The study consisted of an open-label phase, including a 7-week dose optimization period to titrate patients to an optimal dose (maximum 4 mg/day for children and 7 mg/day for adolescents; optimized dose range: 0.05to 0.12 mg/kg/day) and a 6-week dose maintenance period. There were 526 patients included in the open-label phase. Among those, 315 patients who met response criteria in the open-label phase were then randomized (1:1, INTUNIV: placebo) in a 26-week, double-blind, randomized withdrawal phase. The response criteria were defined by 30% reduction in ADHD-RS-IV total score and a Clinical Global Impression-Improvement (CGI-I) score of 1 or 2 during the open-label phase. A statistically significantly lower proportion of treatment failures occurred among INTUNIV patients compared to placebo at the end of the randomized withdrawal period (Figure 4). Treatment failure was defined as a 50% increase (worsening) in ADHD-RS-IV total score and a 2-point increase in Clinical Global Impression-Severity (CGI-S) score. Patients who met the treatment failure criteriaon two consecutive visits or discontinued for any reason were classified as treatment failure. Figure 4.
