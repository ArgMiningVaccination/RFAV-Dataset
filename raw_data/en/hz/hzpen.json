Faculty Council, Staff Council and Student Government Association have endorsed a vaccine requirement for our entire community, including faculty and staff. In April, DePaul told students they would be required to be vaccinated against COVID-19 if they plan to come to campus for any reason in the fall. The results of this survey will help inform DePaul whether additional steps to encourage COVID-19 vaccination among our employees are needed. It also will provide an update to a survey of DePaul employees in February, when the COVID-19 vaccine was not yet widely accessible, that showed the vast majority of our faculty and staff already had received or planned to receive a COVID-19 vaccine. Survey responses will only be used in aggregate and will not be associated with employment records at DePaul. DePaul strongly encourages our faculty and staff to get the COVID-19 vaccine for their safety and the safety of those around them. The vaccines are safe and have been proven highly effective at reducing the spread of the virus as well as preventing hospitalization and death from the virus. For more information about the COVID-19 vaccine, please visit DePaul's COVID-19 Vaccine webpage. "}
