Were you aware that children under the age of five are at maximum risk of dying because of communicable diseases? Diarrhoea, pneumonia, and malaria are some of the leading causes of communicable diseases. The best way to prevent these diseases is by the timely use of vaccinations. However, there are certain measures that parents should keep in mind while administering vaccines to their children. We spoke to our expert Dr Ram Gopal Hola, Senior Consultant, Neonalogist, Rosewalk Healthcare, who suggested the measures that should be followed and avoided while administering vaccines to their children. Possible Side Effects Of Vaccines On Children All vaccines are by and large safe and go through several safety checks before being marketed for use. However, some side effects are common like fever, irritability, pain, redness and swelling at the injection site. The frequency and incidence of these side effects vary from vaccine to vaccine and child to child. The risk of major side effects that threaten the life of the child is extremely rare. The claims that vaccines cause autism or other diseases have been carefully researched and disproved. Vaccination schedules often require the administration of multiple vaccines on a single visit. This is safe, saves time and expense and is less distressing than providing the vaccinations singly in multiple visits. Also Read: [Planning To Conceive A Child?
