It is also known as complementary, unconventional or unortho pp dox medicine, in addition to other descriptions.1 AM includes more than 160 practices or remedies.2 It can be classified into pharmacological categories (e.g. herb pp alism or homeopathy), physical remedies (acupuncture, cupping or chiropractic), dietary approaches (e.g. macp p robiotics and vegetarianism) or cognitive therapy (e.g., hypnosis and other methods). Therefore, it is not ho p p mogenous.3 The seven bestpselling herbal medicines in the USA were ginkgo biloba, St. John's wort, ginseng, garlic, echinacea, saw palmetto and kava.4 Understanding the extent and patterns of complip p mentary and alternative medicine usage in an economip pPrevalence and pattern of alternative medicine use: the results of a household survey Eiad A.

Its popularity is on the increase. Because previous surveys were limited and not generalizable, we estimated the prevalence, pattern and factors associated with use of AM in the community. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: A multistage cluster cross-sectional household survey was conducted among Saudi residents of the Riyadh region. Data were collected in 2003 by trained interviewers from primary health care centers using a specially designed questionnaire. RESULTS: Of 1408 individuals participating in the study, 39% were men. The mean (\u00b1SD) age for the study pop- - ulation was 35.5 (\u00b113.9) years. Sixty-eight percent of the respondents had used AM during the last 12 months. The Holy Quran as a therapy was the most frequently used AM (50.3%), followed by honey (40.1%), black seed (39.2%) and myrrh (35.4%). The health belief model was found to be the most important determinant of AM use. Factors independently associated with AM use included perceived failure of medical treatment, the perceived success of AM, a preference for natural materials, and long appointment intervals to see physicians. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS: There is a high prevalence of AM use in the Riyadh region and the most important determinant of AM use was the perceived failure of medical treatment. The study results call for intensive health education campaigns in the media addressing wrong beliefs regarding AM and modern medicine. The popularity of AM in this community should alert decision makers to look at the difficult acces- - sibility to the health system. cally developing country like Saudi Arabia is important for a number of reasons, including the development of strategies to improve health outcomes and health service planning. Studies in Saudi Arabia are either restricted to inpatients5,6 or to attendants of primary health care (PHC) centers7,8 while others were limited to one type of AM,5,9p11 so their findings cannot be generalized. These studies cannot be used to estimate the prevalence, pattern of use and characteristics of AM users in genp p eral. T o design health education programs, data about the prevalence of AM use and the characteristics of its users are needed. W e estimated the prevalence, cost and side effects of different types of AM use among Saudi adults in the general population by means of a house p p hold survey and studied factors associated with AM use in the Riyadh region.

Each PHC center has a catchment area with a complete registry of its population.13 The sampling unit used in the study was the famp p ily. This was defined as a group of individuals living to pp gether in a household, and usually included the father, the mother, sons and daughters and sometimes grandp p parents and uncles. Based on results of two previous studies in Riyadh city,8,9 a prevalence rate of 20% was estimated. Accepting 5% degree of precision at a 95% level of significance, we estimated that we needed 246 families. Due to the cluster sampling method, a study design effect of 1.5 was used so that the sample size was recalculated to be 246\u00d71.5=369 families. Assuming a response rate of 80%; the final sample size was estimatp p ed to be 369\u00d7100/80=462 families. A multistage random cluster sampling technique was used for the selection of the study population in this crosspsectional study. Selection was based on the W orld Health Organization (WHO) form for a clusp p ter sample.14 The sample size (462 families) was divided into forty clusters, 30 inside Riyadh city and 10 from the suburban areas around the city. Each cluster was composed of 12 households. The clusters were distrib p p uted proportionally according to the size of catchment area for each center. A structured questionnaire was designed to fulfill the study objectives. It consisted of five sections. The first section was concerned with the personal and so p p ciodemographic characteristics of the participants, e.g., age, sex and education. The second section enquired about AM use. The third part enquired about AM practitioners visits, and the reasons and costs of their consultation. The fourth section investigated particip p pants opinions regarding AM and modern medicine (MM). The last part was about AM use in the treatp p ment of children. The first two sections are the source of the data for this paper. The other three sections will be reported elsewhere. The questionnaire design went through many steps including, among others, a brain storming workshop and a pilot study. T o test the reliability of the questionp p naire 28 volunteers completed it on two occasions 2 weeks apart. The alpha coefficient of reliability ranged from 0.83 to 0.95 from the least to the most reliable questions.Data were collected during the period from 6 April 2003 to 22 June 2003. Data collectors were selected from workers in PHC centers based on certain crite p p ria. Each data collection team consisted of one man and two women. T wo workshops in the form of small group discussions, role pplay exercises and feedback were held to train data collectors. Male data collectors inter p p viewed male study subjects and female data collectors interviewed women. The questionnaires were revised for completeness before leaving the household. Field supervisors checked for accuracy as a quality assurance measure. For the sake of comparison with other studies and to quantify the magnitude of AM use, the results were based on the 12 months that preceded the interview. This may have also reduced the recall bias associated with lifelong use. Epi pInfo (Centers for Disease Control, Atlanta, USA) was used for preliminary analysis where data were presented as percentages. Means and standard deviations were calculated for quantitative variables. For comparison between users' characteristics for various AM types, the chi psquare test at 95% level of significance (P=.05) was used. Data were analyzed by the SPSS pro pp gram where multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to determine the independent factors associated with AM use through calculation of the adjusted odds ratio (OR) and its 95% confidence intervals (CI). RESULTS W e achieved a 95% response rate, resulting in a study sample of 1408 persons of whom 550 were males (39.1%) and 858 were females (60.9%). The mean age (\u00b1SD) of the study population was 35.5 (\u00b113.9) years. All were Saudi Arabs. One thousand twentyp eight per p p sons (73%) used AM at some time in the past, about 76% in Riyadh city and 66% in the suburban areas. A total of 955 (67.8%, 95% CI 66%p70%) persons had used AM over the preceding 12 months. About 77% of the women and 54% of the men used AM in the last 12 months. Older people tended to use AM more fre p p quently than their younger counterparts ( P=.03). The widowed (85.7%) and married people (70.1%) used AM more than single people (60.1%) ( P<.0001) (T able 1). Most AM users spent less than SR 500/year (133 USD). The association between occupation and AM use was statistically significant ( P<.0001). The majority of the housewives (81.4%), employees (62.9%), and students (60.9%) used AM. AM was more frequently used among individuals from a large family (72.6%) compared to individuals from a small family (44.7%) (P<.0001) and among high income people (71%) comp p [Downloaded free from http://www.saudiannals.net on Sunday, December 12, 2010, IP: 62.193.94.5]original article Altern Ative Medicine in SAudi ArAbiA Med 28(1) January-February 2008 www.kfshrc.edu.sa/annals \u0018Table 1.

The only factor that was not asso pp ciated with AM use was educational level ( P=.181) (T able 1). The proportion of AM use among suburban residents (54.7%) was less than that of Riyadh city resip p dents (72.6%) ( P=.00001). Treatment with the Holy Qur'an was widely reportp p ed by the study population, by either treating themp p selves by selfpreciting the Qur'an or by having a relative treating them through recitation directly over the body (T able 2). Having the Qur'an recited over water or oil which was then drunk or massaged either by oneself or by a friend/relative was also popular, as was purchase of commercially available water/oil over which the Qur'an had been recited. The use of honey was the second most frequently used AM type followed by black seeds, myrrh, Trigonella foenum (Fenugreek), cautery and antip p mony. In contrast, use of acupuncture was very uncomp p mon (n=4; 0.3% 95% CI 0.00%p 0.06%). W omen used different types of AM more commonly than men. The difference was statistically significant ( P<.001) for all remedies except honey and other less frequently used types, namely cupping, bone setting and acupuncture (T able 2).

Adverse effects of AM use were reported by 6.6% of our study population in the form of diarrhea (3.4%), head p p ache (1.6%) and constipation (1.2%). DISCUSSION This is the largest household survey of AM use in Saudi Arabia. Data collectors were well trained and super p p vised. The study excluded nonpSaudis who constitute one fourth of the people living in Saudi Arabia. AM use in the present study was high (67.8%) compared to other studies in different parts of the world. In the USA, DelMundo et al15 reported that 47% of his study population used AM. Eisenberg et al (1998)16 reported that 34% of the participants, in his 1990 national telep p phone survey of adult Americans 18 years and older, had used AM during the previous year. The same aup p thors conducted a follow pup study between 1990 to 1997 in the USA. They found that the use of at least 1 of 16 remedies increased from 33.8% in 1990 to 42.1% in 1997.17 Fisher and W ard reported that the propor pp tion of patients who used AM over one year was 23% in Denmark and 49% in France.18 Maclennan et al found that 48.5% of Australian people used AM, one pthird of the population regularly visited a natural therapist and twopthirds regularly took vitamins and natural remp p edies.19 Ernst reported in a systematic review that the prevalence of AM use ranged between 9% and 65%.20 The health belief model was found to be an impor pp tant determinant of AM use and attitude towards AM and MM use in the current study. The study population interpretation of MM inability to cure chronic diseases is an example of one important factor of the health belief model. Palinkas et al 2000 suggested that the popularity of AM use and its huge upsurge may be due to fear of adverse effects of MM, the demand for greater patient participation in their treatment, failure of MM and friends' advice.21 Similarly, the current study had shown that factors independently associated with AM use were perceived failure of medical treatment, perceived success of AM, and a preference for natural materials. Similarly, AlpFaris reported that the reasons behind AM use among patients attending PHC centers were its previous success in treating similar illnesses (28%) and dissatisfaction with physician diagnosis (21%).7 The high prevalence of AM use suggests indirectly a failure or inadequacy of health education programs. For instance, some diseases are incurable by medical treatp p ment, e.g. diabetes mellitus, hypertension and cancer. If patients did not realize this fact and continued with unp prealistic hopes, they are likely to abandon medications and advice prescribed by physicians and look for alter p p natives, such as AM. A study of AM use among diabetic patients in KSA found that 17.4% used herbs to treat diabetes mellitus namely, myrrh, black seeds, fenugreek, helteet and aloe.22 The present study revealed that AM is used by women more than men. This finding is inconsistent with DelMundo et al's finding in the USA in which there was no gender difference.15 The present differ pp ence may be attributed to the reduced accessibility that women in Saudi Arabia have to the health care system, in addition to their long stay at home where many herbs are available as well as the influence of the media. The most frequently used types of AM in the cur pp rent study were the Qur'an, honey, black seeds, myrrh or helteet, fenugreek and herbs. In W estern countries, the common types of AM include relaxation, mulp p tivitamins, homeopathy, ginseng, massage, spiritual healing, acupuncture and commercial weight loss pro p p grams.2,19,23,24 Cautery was used by about 7% of the present study population while it is not mentioned in the western studies. DelMundo et al reported that the most common types used were chiropractic (17.2%), re p p laxation (16.9%), herbal medicine (16.9%) and massage (14.2%) in Pennsylvania in the USA.15 Palinkas et al in California reported that 26.7% of the study AM users used herbal remedies which is very similar to the presp p ent study findings (28.3%).21 In Saudi Arabia, AM types are different; visiting a Sheikh for reciting the Qur'an is common. The strong belief in the curative effect of the holy Qur'an contributed to the high prevalence of AM use. AlpFaris found that 46% of patients attending PHC centers in the National Guard Campus in Riyadh used AM over their lives and only 19% used AM during the previous year. Fourteen percent of his study popula p p tion consulted a Sheikh for reciting the Qur'an, while 8.7% used herbs and 4.5% used honey.7 The popularity of AM in any community should alert the decision makers in that it suggests a failure of the traditional health system. The three most important contributing factors to AM use are the perceived failure of medical treatment, the perceived success of AM and a preference for natural materials, which strongly call for intensive health education campaigns in the media and by treating physicians. Such campaigns should tar p p get women, the married, housewives and members of large families. The campaigns should explore people's ideas, concerns and expectations and address wrong be p p liefs regarding AM and MM. The fourth factor, namely the long appointment interval with physicians indicates that there is an accessibility issue with the traditional [Downloaded free from http://www.saudiannals.net on Sunday, December 12, 2010, IP: 62.193.94.5]original article Altern Ative Medicine in SAudi ArAbiA Ann Saudi Med 28(1) January-February 2008 www.kfshrc.edu.sa/annals 10health system. Other studies have reported that some herbs cause liver toxicity.25 In Saudi Arabia, 14 diabetic patients who were prescribed lamb bile by a local AM practip p tioner suffered from nausea, and 12 were hospitalized due to vomiting and diarrhea, one had oligouria, while others lost consciousness.26 AM use among the Riyadh population is very high compared with international figures. The most impor pp tant factor associated with AM use was the health belief model-the perceived failure of MM and the perceived success of AM. There is a need for legislation and conp p trol of AM practice including the clinics of the Holy Qur'an. Liaison with sheikhs who recite the Qur'an as a treatment and establishing a trusting relationship is needed. Similar studies should be conducted in other regions of Saudi Arabia to display the nationwide patp ptern. Academic institutes (e.g. colleges of pharmacy and medicine) should establish centers and databases that include local herbs to provide guidance for evidence p based AM practice. This will help physicians practicp p ing in Saudi Arabia to make safe and evidence pbased decisions during encounters with their patients. For inp p stance, they can use safe types of AM, but continue with the doctors' prescribed medications.
