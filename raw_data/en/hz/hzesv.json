Model/Theory Brief description Client centred counselling The practitioner attempts to e ngage the client in an equal participative relationship, us ing a non directive approach. Communication theory This assumes that modification of attitudes thorough new knowledge, communicated using a variety of means, will change behaviour Community development approaches This approach is based on the id eal that cost effective, public health based programmes can have an effect on whole communities. Specific aspects of community development approaches are dependent on community organisation and participation. Community organisation theory This emphasises influencing i ndividuals through changing the community, because health related behaviours are deeply embedded in social and cultural contexts. It included community self development and outside influences needed to promote re-organisation Decision theory principles Focuses on information acquisiti on and use through attitudinal and social change Diffusion of innovations theory This assumes that for changes to be adopted, informant and social groups and organisational structures must be receptive to changes in individu als and the environment Ecological Models Ecological models specific to health promotion are multifaceted\u2014targeting environmental, behavioral, and social policy changes that help indivi duals adopt hea lthy behaviors. The Social Ecological Model prov ides a set of conceptual and methodological principles, drawn largely from systems theory, for organizing comprehensive, community based, health promotion initiatives Foetal Health Locus of Control The Foetal Health Locus of Control model focuses on women's motivation to take actions related to their beliefs in their abilities to influence the outcome of pregnancy. The FHLCS evaluation includes the extent to which women agree with statements covering three subcategories: internal controls; chance; and powerful others. Health Belief Model This stipulates that a person's health-related behaviour depends on the person's perception of four critical areas: the 1 US Surgeon General's Report on Physical Activity and Health (2003) Chapter 6 - Understanding and Promoting Physical Activity 2 Roe L, Hunt P, Bradshaw H & Rayner M (1997) Health promotion interventions to promote healthy eating in the general population; a review.

National Social Marketing Centre. 4Model/Theory Brief description severity of a potential illness, the person's susceptibility to that illness, the benefits of taking a preventive action, and the barriers to taking that action. The model also incorporates cues to action Organisational Change theory The basis of this is to estab lish an organisational environment conducive to change Persuasive communications theory The approach to change is made from several different directions, including environmental change PRECEDE-PROCEED This is a systematic model for planning interventions, which incorporates elements from many theoretical models. The needs assessment compon ent (PRECEDE) assesses predisposing, enabling and re-inforcing factors. The PROCEED component plans and implements intervention strategies Social Ecological Model) See Ecological Models Social Learning/Social Cognitive Theory Social learning theory, later re named social cognitive theory, proposes that behaviour change is affected by environmental influences, personal factors, a nd attributes of the behaviour itself. Each may affect or be affected by either of the other two. A central tenet of social cognitive theory is the concept of self-efficacy. Social marketing (health related) The systematic application of marketing concepts and techniques to achieve specific behavioural goals relevant to improving health and reducing he alth inequalities. Proposed Benchmarks to profile social marketing interventions are: Behaviour Change; Consumer Research; Segmentation & Targeting; Marketing Mix; Exchange; Competition. See 3 for further information. Stages of Change See Transtheoretical model Theory of Planned Behaviour The theory of planned behavi our adds to the theory of reasoned action the concept of perceived control over the opportunities, resources, and skil ls necessary to perform a behaviour Theory of Reasoned Action The theory of reasoned action states that individual performance of a given behaviour is primarily determined by a person's intention to perform that behaviour. This intention is determined by two major factors: the person's attitude toward the behaviour (i.e., beliefs about the outcomes of the behaviour and the value of thes e outcomes) and the influence of the person's social envir onment or subjective norm (i.e., beliefs about what other peopl e think the person should do, as well as the person's motivation to comply with the opinions of others). Transtheoretical Model In this model, behaviour change has been conceptualised as a five-stage process or continuum related to a person's readiness 5Model/Theory Brief description to change: precontemplation, contemplation, preparation, action, and maintenance. Pe ople are thought to progress through these stages at varying rates, often moving back and forth along the continuum a number of times before attaining the goal of maintenance 6APPENDIX 2a: Review 1 - su mmaries of included papers, organised alphabetically by first author Citation Akinbami LJ, Cheng Kornfeld D (2001): A review of teen-tot programs: comprehensive clinical care for young parents and their children. Adolescence 36, 381-393. Study design Systematic review Types of study included There were no pre-specified inclusion or exclus ion criteria in relation to the study design. One study was a randomised trial. The remaining three studies were case-control studies, one of which used a control group of mothers who had delivered a year earlier. Geographical scope No restrictions mentioned Dates covered by review/meta-analysis 1980-2000 Focus e.g. topic or approach relevant to current review Teenage pregnancy Objectives of study To review the experience of teen-tot programmes in meeting the goals of improving outcomes and preventing repeat pregnancies. Study Population Teenage parents Results Each of the included studies had multidimen sional interventions. These included well-child health visits; 24-hour on call system to an interdisciplinary team; individual counselling about financial management, school and work; and social worker reviewed family planning methods with referrals to a birth control c linic.Four studies reported a decreased repeat pregnancy rate (12 to 26 weeks postpartum), wh ich was statistically significant for 3 of the studies. Repeat pregnancy (intervention versus control) in these 3 studies was 16 versus 38%, 9 versus 70%, and 12 versus 28%. In the fourth study, the data were not reported separately for each of the outcomes; instead a composite score was calculated for the 10 outcomes Any information on theoretical models used in included studies No Authors conclusions The teen-tot programmes had moderate success in preventing repeat pregnancies, helping teenage mothers continue their education, and im proving parent and infant health over 6 to 18 months. However, study weaknesses may have had an impact on the observed effectiveness. Reviewers'comments CRD comment:The authors note, justifiably, in the discussion that ther e was limited evidence upon which to judge the evidence of teen-tot pr ogrammes. However, they concluded that they had moderate success in preventing repeat pregna ncies, helping teen mothers continue their education and improving teenage and infant health. The conclusions are perhaps overly positive given the limitations of the studies that were highlighted. However, the authors acknowledged that study limitations might have reduced or accentuated observed effectiveness. They also drew attention to unanswered questions, such as the efficacy of separate programme components and the long-term sustainability of benefits. However, while teen tots programmes may be very worthwh ile, it seems unwarranted on the basis of the evidence presented in the review to say that there should be increased support and funding. 7Citation Banks-Wallace J & Conn V (2002): Interventions to promote physical activity among African American women. Public Health Nursing 19, 321-335. Study design Systematic review Types of study included The inclusion criteria for study design were not stated. The included studies were randomised controlled trials (RCTs), non-randomised trials , single-group pre-test post-test studies, single- group repeated measures studies, and studies using a single treatment group with baseline data and outcome data fro m different participants. Geographical scope All studies in which African American women comprised at least 35% of the sample - by implication restricted to USA. English Language only. Dates covered by review/meta-analysis 1984-2000 Focus e.g. topic or approach relevant to current review Physical activity Objectives of study To review intervention trials designed to promote increased physical activity among African American women Study Population African American women aged 18-79y. Results Eighteen studies (n=1,623) were included. Of these, 7 (n=503) were RCTs, 7 (n=387) were single-group pre-test post-test or repeated measures studies, 3 (n=86) were non-randomised studies, and one (n=647) was a study of non-standard design that used different participants for the baseline data and outcome data (both set s of participants were exposed to the same intervention). All studies included deliberate e ducational interventions designed to alter physical activity behaviour. The majority (n=14) of the included studies also targeted dietary behaviours. Two studies with an individually deliv ered intervention continued for 6 months of intervention, while the remainder varied fro m 6 to 18 weeks. The intervention strategies included group meetings, supervised exercise, and individualised education and counselling. Some interventions were based on theoretical frameworks. The interventions yielded mixed results in terms of their effectiveness in prom oting physical activity. Six studies that used direct measures of activity reported significant increases in physical activity behaviour. Five studies that used direct measures did not find st atistically significant increases in activity. One study with an indirect measure of activity (heart rate) found a significant increase in physical activity following the intervention, while another study using heart rate found no statistically significant increase. Ten studies reported d ecreased weight, body mass index and waist measurement. Four of the 7 studies that meas ured the outcome one month or less after completing the intervention found significant in creases in activity behaviour. Two of the 3 studies that measured physical activity at least 6 months following delivery of the intervention did not find a significant increase in activity behaviour. Several studies reported measures of outcomes that could be attributed to changes in either diet or physical activity behaviour. Four of these studies reported significant improvements in health indices. Of the 10 studies with supervised activity sessions, five found increased activity outcomes. Only 2 studies tested the same intervention, both of which found improved health changes that could be attributed to either a change in diet or change in activity le vel. Of the 4 studies that based their intervention on a theoretical framework, two reported mixe d positive findings, one reported a lack of increased activity, and one reported weight loss fro m an intervention that focused on both diet and activity behaviour Any information on theoretical models used in included studies Yes. Theoretical models were used in four studies. 8Authors conclusions The number of studies designed to promote activity among African American women is growing, but study design and measurement limita tions combined with inadequate replication of intervention components prevent the exis ting evidence from forming a solid base for practice. Reviewers'comments CRD comment:This was a clearly written review that highlighted the lack of internally valid studies in this area, resulting in limited confid ence in causal connections. The included studies were discussed in detail with the strengths a nd weaknesses of each study, and for the studies overall, given. It was unclear whether the significant attrition rates of the individual studies were accounted for in the analysis, and failure to use intention-to-treat analysis may have resulted in inflated effect estimates. The search strategy was limited and relevant studies may have been missed, particularly since the search was limited to studies reported in English. The reason for amending the inclusion criteria in the original protocol was given; however, the wider inclusion criteria may have limited the a pplicability of the results to the original specific group of African American women. Furt hermore, most of the included studies used a mixed intervention of diet modification and methods to increase physical activity, despite the original aim to review only methods of increasi ng physical activity. This limited the internal validity of the overall results. The tabulated descriptions of the included studies were not entirely consistent with the descriptions given in the text. The results of each included study were only descriptive, and it was unclear whether a reported increase or decrease was statistically significant, and if so, at what le vel of significance. Despite this, the authors' conclusions seem to follow from the results and a useful set of recommendations for future research was given. 9Citation Black ME, Yamada J & Mann V (2002): A systema tic literature review of the effectiveness of community-based strategies to increase cervical cancer screening.

Among the strong/moderate studies, 10 were aimed at disa dvantaged women. The most frequently used intervention was mass media campaigns, alone or combined with individual strategies; followed by individual education using lay health educators; and last, letters of invitation. Clinical improvements range from 61 per cent fo r Education Video to 12 per cent gain from a physician letter compared to a no intervention gr oup. Of the 4 studies that used mass-media campaigns alone, only one was effective and th at study targeted specific subpopulation with language specific material. All of the studies th at combined mass-media campaigns with other strategies were effective but increasing by either smear rates or early cancer detection. Letters of invitation were effective but required a cen tralised registry was surveyed to identify eligible women. The authors of the five studi es with no improvements identified limitations such as under staffing, low power to detect differences, and failures to address system barriers. Any information on theoretical models used in included studies Yes, of the 19 moderate or strong studies, 7 repor ted a theoretical basis, with the most popular being the Social Cognitive model. Authors conclusions Strategies that combined mass media campaigns with direct tailored education to women and/or health care providers seemed most successful. 10Citation Ciliska D, Miles E, O'Brien MA, Turl C, Tomasik HH, Donovan U & Beyers J (1999): The effectiveness of community interventions to increase fruit and vegetable consumption in people four years of age and older Hamilton-We ntworth, Social and Public Health Services Division. 45. Study design Systematic review Types of study included Prospective studies with a comparison group we re eligible for inclusion.

Geographical scope No restrictions mentioned Dates covered by review/meta-analysis All dates in electronic databases Focus e.g. topic or approach relevant to current review Fruit & Veg Objectives of study To assess the effectiveness of community based interventions to increase fruit and vegetable consumption in people 4 years and older Study Population Low-income mothers (n=4,106), grade 4 to 9 school children and Girl Scout troops (number not reported), adult patients at family practice offices (n=394), women at risk of breast cancer (n=303), adult workers (n=29,762) and unspecified (1 study) Results 60 relevant articles were identified in the origin al article written in JNE. One was strong, 17 moderate, and 42 weak. The authors also wrote a more structured review which is reported in the CRD databases. This included 15 moderate or strong studies Four studies were targeted at parents of young children, six at school-aged children, and five at adults, with two of the latter about worksite interventions. A prof essional nutritionist conducted most of the interventions. 1) Interventions with parents of young children: all of the included studies examined educational programmes. The specific programmes were: instruction using lectures, written materials and demonstrations on th e topics of nutrition facts, selecting and buying food, cooking and pr eserving food and food safety (1 study); an educational programme delivered by a paraprofessional covering cooking methods, food choices, decreasing fatty foods, increasing fruit a nd vegetable consumption, and lifestyle factors (1 study); nutrition letters and wo rkshops covering nutrition and pre-school children, feeding pre-school children, me al planning and preparation, and food shopping skills (1 study); group nutrition sessions using printed materials and reminders 1 study). 2) Interventions with school children: lessons and provision of 'hands on experience' in the cafeteria aimed at increasing knowledge as part of the school curriculum (6 studies), either with or without brochures being sent to parents. 3) 3a) Interventions with adults (non-works ite): mailed nutrition information (1 study); group education sessions (1 study); developm ent of groups for 'Heart health' (1 study). In one trial, in which the particip ants received either tailored or non-tailored information regarding dietary change, th ere were no differences between the groups observed at follow-up 4 months post-interve ntion. Both groups decreased their fruit and vegetable intake by 0.25 servings/d ay. The second randomised trial which was conducted on women who were at risk of breast cancer, aimed to reduce total calorie intake, increase complex carbohydrates, and en sure adequate intake of vitamins and minerals without supplements. The results showed at 12 and 24 months' follow-up, fruit and vegetable intake significantly increased (P<0.001) in the intervention group more than in the control, from a baseline of 15.9% of total kcal/day to 22% at 12 11months and 23.1% at 24 months (P<0.001). The total energy intake decreased in the intervention group by 25% and they experienced a mean weight loss of 3.1 kg. The results of the final study, which assessed the effectiveness of having a Healthy Heart Coalition, showed that there was no change in the proportion of people who consumed at least five servings of fruits a nd vegetables per day, whether or not they were from a community that had an active coalition. 3b)Interventions with adults (worksite): health promotion campaign involving education, posters and information (2 studies). The results of the first trial indicated that the intake of fruits and vegetables in creased from 2.6 to 2.8 servings/day in the intervention group, compared with 2.58 to 2.6 servings/day in the control group (P<0.001). Furthermore, movement through the stages of change was more likely in the intervention group, and dietary changes were associated with movement in stages of change. The results of the second trial showed that there was no post-test difference in the mean servings per month of fruit. However, the mean servings/month of vegetables decreased by 1. 6 in the control group, and increased by 6.8 in the intervention group (P<0.02). The intervention group also a experienced significant mean reduction in the servings/week of margarine and butter Any information on theoretical models used in included studies Stages of change used in one included stud y and was associated with dietary change. Authors conclusions There was support for the use of peer educat ors and paraprofessionals with low-income mothers, although a study of a direct comparison of two groups led by a professional nutritionist versus a paraprofessional has not b een found. The most effective interventions gave clear messages about increasing fruit and vege table consumption; incorporated multiple strategies that reinforced the messages; involve d the family; were more intensive; were provided over a longer period of time, rather th an one or two contacts; and were based on a theoretical framework.People in public health positions who make decisions about nutrition interventions need to give priority to those in terventions that are multi-pronged, flexible, open to input from target groups and theoretica lly based. Careful and cooperative, multisite evaluations should be conducted to guide future programmes Reviewers'comments CRD commentary The authors addressed a clear review question in terms of the type of intervention, participants and outcome measures that were to be included in the review. The literature search was thorough, but was restrict ed to published studies; this means that relevant unpublished studies ma y have been missed. The review process, in terms of the inclusion of studies, the validity assessment and data extraction, was explicit and was undertaken systematically by more than one reviewer, although it was not stated how any discrepancies between the reviewers were handl ed. Appropriate steps were taken in all of these processes to minimise bias. Adequate details of the primary study characteristics were provided in the paper, allowing the reader to assess whether the authors' results and conclusion are consistent with the evidence base reviewed. The narrative summary of the results was appropriate. Overall, this was a reasonably well-conducted review in which a number of steps were taken to minimise bias in the review process. The authors' results and conclusions are consistent with the primary studies reviewed. 12Citation DiCenso A, Guyatt G, Willan A & Griffith L (2002): Interventions to reduce unintended pregnancies among adolescents: systematic revi ew of randomised controlled trials.

Four abstinence programmes a nd one school based sex education programme were associated with an in crease in number of pregnanci es among partners of young male participants (1.54; 1.03 to 2.29). There were significantly fewer pregnancies in young women who received a multifaceted programme (0.41; 0.20 to 0.83), though baseline differences in this study favoured the intervention (In the one study that evaluated a multifaceted programme at baseline the control group had high er levels of previous course failure, school suspension, and teenage pregnancy ) Any information on theoretical models used in included studies No Authors conclusions Overall: Primary prevention strategies evaluate d to date do not delay the initiation of sexual intercourse, improve use of birth control among young men and women, or reduce the number of pregnancies in young women. More detailed: There is some evidence that prevention programmes may need to begin much ear lier than they do. In a recent systematic review of eight trials of day care for disadvant aged children under 5 years of age, long term follow up showed lower pregnancy rates among adolescents. We need to investigate the social determinants of unintended pregnancy in adolescents through large longitudinal studies beginning early in life and use the results of the multivariate analyses to guide the design of prevention interventions. We should carefully examine countries with low pregnancy rates among adolescents. For example, the Netherlands has one of the lowest rates in the world (8.1 per 1000 young women aged 15 to 19 years), and Ketting and Visser have published an analysis of associated factors. In contrast, the rates are 93 per 1000 in the United States,46 62.6 per 1000 in England and Wales,47 and 42.7 per 1000 in Canada.48 We should examine effective programmes designed to prevent othe r high risk behaviours in adolescents. For example, Botvin et al found that school based programmes to prevent drug abuse during junior high school (ages 12-14 years) resulted in important and durable reductions in use of 13tobacco, alcohol, and marijuana if they taught a combination of social resistance skills and general life skills, were properly implemented, and included at least two years of booster sessions. Few sexual health interventions ar e designed with input from adolescents. Adolescents have suggested that sex education should be more positive with less emphasis on anatomy and scare tactics; it should focus on ne gotiation skills in sexual relationships and communication; and details of sexual health clinics should be advertised in areas that adolescents frequent (for example, school toilets, shopping centres). None of the interventions in this review focused on strategies for impr oving the quality of sexua l relationships. Sexual exploitation, lack of mutual respect, and di scomfort in voicing sexual needs and desires are common problems in adulthood. Interventions to help adolescents learn about healthy sexual relationships need to be desi gned and evaluations of these in terventions that follow the adolescents into adulthood should be done. 14Citation Dunn AL (1996): Getting started--a review of ph ysical activity adoption studies.

Study Population Adults Results Only two prospective surveys iden tified specifics of adoption of physical activity. Most of the evidence for techniques that help inactive peopl e to adopt physical activity comes from quasi- experimental and experimental interven tion studies examining various cognitive and behavioural strategies at the individual level Any information on theoretical models used in included studies Yes, these are discussed in relation to the description of each included study Authors conclusions More prospective observational studies aimed at homogeneous subgroups are needed to identify correlates of physical activity adoption to help tailor interventions. Continued clinical studies are needed to differentiate the necessar y and sufficient strategies at the personal and interpersonal levels. Interventions aimed at e nvironmental, institutional, and social levels remain largely unexplored and there is a need for more research that specifically targets inactive subgroups at these levels. Reviewers'comments This review is not particulary well structured , and there is no synthesis of the results, although there is interpretation of personal level interventions, interpersonal approaches, organisatonal and community approaches, a nd environmental policy approaches ( i.e. reflecting the Winett 1989 multilevel, multidisciplinary approach. 15Citation Dyson L, McCormick F & Renfrew MJ (2005): In terventions for promoting the initiation of breastfeeding.The Cochrane Da tabase of Systematic Reviews 2005, Issue 2.

Five trials involving 582 women on low incomes in the USA showed breastfeeding education had a significant effect on increasing initiation rates compared to routine care (relative risk (RR) 1.53, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.25 to 1.88).A meta-analysis of 5 studies ev aluating the effectiveness of health education interventions for increasing initiation rates of breastfeeding showed the interventions were effective overall. (1) Health education interv entions (comparison group one) Analysis of a single study evaluating the effect of a health education plus postnatal support type intervention shows a statistically signicant effect (RR 2.18, CI 1.40 to 3.40) in favour of increasing initiation rates (defined as breastfeeding in hospital) when delivered to a total of 108 white, low-income women in the USA (Brent 1995). This intervention consisted of two to four breastfeeding education sessions for 10 to 15 minutes each during the prenatal period, delivered on a one-to-one basis by a lactation consultant. The content of sessions was based on the participants' needs and interests. After delivery, mothers were followed up with daily inpatient rounds by the lactation consultant, a telephone call 48 hours after discharge, a visit to the lactation clinic at one week and the pr esence of the lactation consultant at each health supervision visit until weaning or when the infa nt was one year of age. Professional education was also directed at nursing and medical staff who interacted with the breastfeeding dyad. (2) Breastfeeding promotion packs (comparison group two) A single study (Howard 2000) involving 547 women reported on the outcome of initiation of breastfeeding. The provision of a non-commercial breastfeeding promotion pack compared to a formula company produced pack has been shown to have no effect ( RR 0.93, CI 0.80 to 1.08) on increasing initiation rates among women of middle- or higher-inc ome groups in a high-income country setting (USA). The authors also reported no effect on rates of stopping breastfeeding up to two weeks (RR 1.58, CI 0.97 to 2.56). (3) Early mother-infant contact followed by separation (comparison group three) A single study (Linde nberg 1990) (including 259 women and baby pairs) reported on the outcome of initiation of breast feeding. It must be noted that whilst this intervention evaluated early mother infant contact immediately after birth, mothers and babies were then separated for the rest of their stay . This study was shown to have no effect (RR 1.05, CI 0.94 to 1.17) on increasing initiation rates among women living in a low- and middle-income country setting (Nicaragua). Any information on theoretical models used in included studies No Authors conclusions Early mother-infant contact followed by comple te separation until hospital discharge was not effective when targeting women living in po or urban areas in a low- and middle-income 16country setting. Further research into early mo ther-infant contact followed by rooming-in until hospital discharge may, however, be eff ective at increasing breastfeeding initiation rates among various population groups. Breastfeeding prom otion packs, in contexts where formula feeding packs are very widely distributed, may be an inappropriate use of valuable breastfeeding promotion resources that could be more effectively used for population-appropriate breastfeeding education. 17Citation Eden KB, NJ & Teutsch SM (2002): by clinicians improve physical activity?

Most of the trials were conducted in typical primary care practices, and all included multiple sites. Clinicians delivered advice themselves but usually did not perform the in itial assessment. In some trials, the patients completed a self-report tool on physical activity levels or answered selected questions from larger validated health ssessment tools admini stered by telephone, in the office waiting area, or in the home . Often, a nurse or research assistant conducted a baseline assessment and placed it on the medical chart for review during th e clinician's visit. The clinician used the assessment information to exclude patients for w hom physical activity was contraindicated or to tailor the intervention to each patient's needs. In most trials , the clinician advised sedentary or minimally active patients to achieve regular, moderate- intensity physical activity; in some trials, clinicians recommended vigorous activity as an option. Five studies targeted physical activity alone, while three also had other behavioral targets (for example, diet change, smoking cessation). In three of the trials, the primary care clinicians condensed advice and counseling on behavior change into a single 3- to 5-minute encounter and, for some patients, a follow-up session with the clinician or another memb er of the health care team. Five trials did not report the amount of time that the clinicia n spent with patients for the intervention Among six controlled trials with a usual care contro l group, the effects of counseling on physical activity were mixed. Because most studies had at least one methodologic limitation, it was difficult to rigorously assess the efficacy of the interventions. More research is needed to clarify the effect, benefits, and potential harms of counseling patients in primary care settings to increase physical activity. Any information on theoretical models used in included studies Yes, 4 of the 8 trials used the transtheoreti cal model, 1 used the social cognitive approach, and 1 used self management. Authors conclusions Evidence is inconclusive that counseling a dults in the primary care setting to increase physical activity is effective. Reviewers'comments CRD comment: The review question was clear in te rms of the intervention, participants, study design and outcomes. Several relevant databases were searched, but it was not stated whether any language restrictions were applied and the methods used to select the studies were not explicitly described. Some studies may have been missed since the searches only went back to 1994 (the date of earlier overview), and the earlier overview itself may have missed some studies since it was not a systematic review. Validity was formally assessed using defined criteria and only those studies meeting the mi nimal quality criteria were included in the 18review. The methods used to assess validity were described. Relevant data were extracted and tabulated, but since only one reviewer extracted the data there is the potential for errors. The results were appropriately grouped by control intervention type and combined in a narrative synthesis in which attention was drawn to ev idence from better quality studies. The evidence presented supports the authors' conclusion 19Citation Fairbank L, & Lister-Sharp D (2000): A systematic review to evaluate the effectiven ess of interventions to promote the initiation of breastfeeding. Health Technol Assess 4, 1-171 Study design Systematic review Types of study included Randomised controlled trials (RCTs), non-RCTs w ith concurrent controls, and before-after studies (cohort or cross-sectional). Geographical scope No restrictions mentioned Dates covered by review/meta-analysis All dates in electronic databases Focus e.g. topic or approach relevant to current review Breastfeeding Objectives of study The primary aim of this systematic review was to evaluate existing ev idence to identify which promotion programmes are effective at increasing the number of women who start to breastfeed. Study Population Pregnant women, mothers in the immediate pos tpartum period before the first breastfeed, any participant linked to pregnant women or new mo thers, or any participant who may breastfeed in the future, or be linked to a breastfeeding woman in the future. Results A total of 59 studies met the selection criteria, comprising 14 RCTs, 16 non-RCTs and?29 before-after studies. Interventions were groupe d into the following-categories:- health education- health sector initiatives (HSI) - gene ral- HSI - Baby Friendly Hospital Initiative (BFHI) HSI - training of health professionals HSI - US Department of Agriculture's Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) HSI - social support from health professionals peer support media campaigns multifaceted interventions. In many cases, studies were dissim ilar in terms of the type of intervention(s), participants and the definitions of outcomes. Methodological problems of some studies also limited interpretation of findings. Whilst th e results from before-after studies should be viewed with some caution, inclusion of th ese studies provided a useful evidence base for evaluation of more complex interventions. H ealth education (nine RCTs, seven non-RCTs, three before-after studies) Breastfeeding literatu re alone, or combined with a more formal, non-interactive method of health education, app ears to have limited impact on initiation rates. Small, informal, group health education classes, delivered in the antenatal period, can be an effective intervention to increase initiation ra tes, and in some cases the duration of breastfeeding, among women from different income or ethnic groups. HSI: general, and based on the BFHI (two RCTs, three non-RCTs, four before-after studies) Institutional changes in hospital practices to promote breastfeeding, either as part of, or independent to, the BFHI, can be effective at increasing both the initiation and duration of breastfeeding, particularly in developing countries. These may include stand- alone interventions such as rooming-in, or a package of interventions, such as rooming-in, early contact and health education. HSI:WIC (two RCTs, three non-RCTs, five before-after studies) In most studies, WIC programs were effective at increasing both the initiation and duration of breastfeeding among women of low- income groups in the USA. Effective WIC interv entions included one-to-one health education in the antenatal period, peer counselling in th e ante- and postnatal periods, or a combination of one-to-one health education and peer coun selling in the anteand postnatal periods. HSI: training of health professionals (five before-after studies) The limited evidence available suggests that these programmes may be useful in improving the knowledge of midwives and nurses; however, favourable results were not shown in terms of changes in attitudes of health professionals, or changes in breastfeeding rates. HSI: social support from health professionals (one RCT) The social support intervention did not produce significantly increased rates of 20initiation compared with standard care. Peer support (two non-RCTs) Both studies showed peer support programmes, when delivered as a stand-alone intervention to women in low- income groups, to be an effective interven tion at increasing initiation rates (and duration) among women who had expressed a wish to breast feed. Media campaigns (two before- after studies) The limited evidence available sugg ests that a media campaign as a stand-alone intervention, and particularly television co mmercials, may improve attitudes towards, and increase initiation rates of, breastfeeding. Mu ltifaceted interventions (one non- RCT, 10 before-after studies) Several studies found multif aceted interventions to be effective in increasing initiation rates (and duration and excl usivity of breastfeeding). Most of the multifaceted interventions that were found to be effective comprised a media campaign and/or a peer support programme combined with structur al changes to the health sector (HSI) or, in fewer cases, combined with health education activities. Any information on theoretical models used in included studies No Authors conclusions Three types of intervention have been shown to be useful in the promotion of breastfeeding when delivered as a stand-alone intervention in developed countries. 1) Informal, small group health education, delivered during the antenata l period, appears to be effective at increasing initiation rates among women from different inco me groups and from some minority ethnic groups. 2) There is also some evidence to show that one-to-one health education can be effective at increasing initiation rates among women on low incomes.3) Peer support programmes, delivered in the ante- and postnat al periods, have also been shown to be effective at increasing both initiation and duration rates of breastfeeding among women on low incomes, and particularly among women who have expressed a wish to breastfeed. Packages of interventions have also been s hown to be effective at increasing the initiation and, in most cases, the duration of breastfeeding in developed countries. Effective packages appear to include a peer support programme and/or a media campaign combined with structural changes to the health sector and/or h ealth education activities. Structural changes in hospital practices to promote breastfeeding (HS I) have been shown to be effective at increasing both initiation and duration of breastfeed ing in developing coun tries. Rooming-in, as either a stand-alone intervention or as one co mponent of a package of interventions, is a key example of an effective HSI. 21Citation Forbes C, Jepson R & Martin Hirsch P (1999): In terventions targeted at women to encourage the uptake of cervical screening. Study design Systematic review Types of study included Randomised controlled trials (RCTs), or quasi-RCTs Geographical scope No restrictions mentioned Dates covered by review/meta-analysis All dates in electronic databases Focus e.g. topic or approach relevant to current review Screening Objectives of study To assess the effectiveness of interventions ai med at increasing uptake, and informed uptake of cervical cancer screening Study Population Women Results Thirty-five studies were included (27 RCTs and eight quasi-RCTs). Overall, invitations and educational interventions appeared to be the mo st effective methods of increasing the absolute uptake of cervical screening. However, hete rogeneity between the studies limited the statistical pooling of data. Evidence regarding th e effectiveness of other interventions such as economic incentives, procedural interventions (i .e. revealing the gender of the smear taker and using a health promotion nurse), counselling and risk factor assessment was limited by the number and quality of included studies. In addition statistical pooling of the data was limited by the presence of heterogeneity betw een the studies. No studies examined the effectiveness of interventions at increasing the informed uptake of cervical screening. 1) Invitations: In general invitati on letters were effective at encouraging women to attend for Pap smear. There was also some limited evid ence that telephone invitations increased uptake, but it was unclear whether this practice was more effective than invitation letters. It was also unclear as to whether sending invitation letters with appointments was any more effective than sending invitation letters alone. However, there was some evidence to suggest that invitation letters with fixed appointments were more effective than invitations with open appointments. 2) Education: There was insuffi cient evidence in the form of statistically significant findings from good quality trials to s upport any particular educational intervention, but overall the consensus from the studies exam ining educational interventions was in favour of the intervention over the no intervention/us ual care control. However, heterogeneity between the studies limited the statistical pool ing of data. Amongst ethnic minority groups there appeared to be some limited eviden ce to support the use of lay members of the community in presenting culturally-tailored info rmation. However, the findings may vary according to ethnic group and further research is required. The only study which examined the use of video/slide presentations was of reasonable quality and showed a statistically significant increase in Pap smear uptake in favour of the intervention as compared with control. Educational materials are likely to be important in increasing informed uptake, providing they cover all aspects of the screening process. For example, the Cervical Screening Action Team in the UKhas recommended that a leaflet emphasising the risks and benefits should be included with every invitation for screening. 3) Informed uptake: The purpose of any screening test needs to be adequately e xplained to potential participants, and given alongside information about what the results of the screening test actually mean and the risks and benefis of screening. However, in this review none of the studies reported giving information on the risks and benefits of screen ing, and none of them included informed uptake or knowledge as an outcome measures. Wh ether informed uptake affects actual levels of uptake, therefore, has yet to be fully evalua ted. All of the trials included in this review 22were undertaken on the premise that screeni ng was beneficial and high uptake should be achieved at all costs. Any information on theoretical models used in included studies No Authors conclusions There was some evidence to support the use of invitation letters to increase the uptake of cervical screening. There was limited evidence to support educational interventions but it was unclear what format was most effective. Th e majority of the studies were from developed countries and so the relevance to developing countries is unclear 23Citation Guise JM, Palda V, Westhoff C, Chan BK, He lfand M & Lieu TA (2003): The effectiveness of primary care-based interventions to promote breastfeeding: evidence review and meta- analysis for the U.S. Preventiv e Services Task Force.

Dates covered by review/meta-analysis All dates in electronic databases, until 2001 Focus e.g. topic or approach relevant to current review Breastfeeding Objectives of study To evaluate the effectiveness of counselling, be havioural and environmental interventions to improve breast-feeding Study Population Women, pre and post natal Results Thirty studies were included: 22 RCTs (n=5,034) and 8 non-RCTs (n=1,809).Twelve studies were judged to be of fair quality, 2 of g ood quality and 16 of poor quality. The included studies employed a variety of interventions: group or individual education, in-person or telephone support, written materi als, rooming-in, early contact and commercial discharge packets. 1)Breast-feeding education (12 studies): Programmes that had educational components increased breast- feeding initiation (mean difference 0.23, 95% CI: 0.12, 0.34) and short-term continuation up to 3 months (mean difference 0.39, 95% CI: 0.27, 0.50). Education did not significantly improve long-te rm duration up to 6 months (mean difference 0.04, 95% CI: -0.06, 0.16) 2)Breast-feedi ng support (8 studies). Support alone significantly increased short- and long-term breast-feeding duration (mean differences 0.11, 95% CI: 0.03, 0.19 and 0.08, 95% CI: 0.02, 0.16, respectively), but did not have a significant effect on initiation (mean difference 0.06, 95% CI: -0.02, 0. 15). 3) Combined education and support (4 studies): Compared with support alone, comb ined interventions produced larger increases in initiation (mean difference 0.21, 95% CI: 0.07, 0.35) and short-term duration (mean difference 0.37, 95% CI: 0.17, 0.58), but no difference in long-term duration. Combined education and support did not produce significantly different effects from education alone. 4) Support and peer counselling (4 non-randomised studies, 1 RCT): One of the 4 non-RCTs found a significant benefit for breast- feeding initiation, while 2 non-RCTs found a significant benefit for short-term breast-feeding. The results of the RCT were not reported. 5) Written materials (7 RCTs). Written materials alone did not increase breast-feeding rates (3 RCTs). The combination of education plus written mate rials appeared less effective than education alone (3 studies; short-term duration, indirect comparison). 6) Rooming-in (1 study): The effectiveness of rooming-in could not be est ablished as multiple other interventions were included in this study. 7) Early maternal contact (4 studies): No significant benefit was seen (odds ratio 1.23, 95% CI: 0.65, 2.05). Any information on theoretical models used in included studies No Authors conclusions Education and support interventions to promote breast-feeding appeared to improve breast- feeding initiation and maintenance up to 6 mont hs. Educational sessions that review the benefits of breast-feeding, principles of lact ation, myths, common problems, solutions and skills training seemed to have the greatest single effect Reviewers'comments CRD comments:This review addressed a clear qu estion using explicit inclusion criteria. The literature search was fairly comprehensive and the search terms were reported. Only English 24language studies were included. It was unc lear whether unpublished studies were sought, which might have led to relevant studies bei ng missed. Details of the review process (how many reviewers selected the studies, assessed valid ity and extracted the data) were reported; these were adequate to minimise the risk of bi as being introduced. The review covered a wide range of interventions and partic ipants, and it is therefore possible that such variations might have affected the outcomes. The Bayesian analys is explored the effects of specific elements of the interventions by pooling them separatel y, but did not take variation in participant populations into account. The methodological quality of the included studies was considered in a sensitivity analysis, but the results of this did not appear to have been reported. The authors' conclusions seem to follow from the r esults presented in the review, but should be viewed with caution given the limitations highlighted 25Citation Harden A, Brunton G, Fletcher A, Oakley A, Burchett H & Backhams M (2006) Young people, pregnancy and social exclusion: A sy stematic synthesis of research evidence to identify effective, appropriate and promisi ng approaches for prevention and support.

Study Population Young people<20y Results A smaller number of studies were looked at in mo re detail for the two in-depth reviews. The teenage pregnancy review included 15 studies: 10 evaluations of interventions, and 5 studies of young people's views. All the interventions were multi-component and based in the USA. Six of the intervention studies provided sound evidence of the value of two particular approaches to targeting the social exclusion associated with unintended teenage pregnancy: early childhood interventions consisting of preschool education, parenting support, and social skills development; and youth development programmes combining community service and student learning, or providing a programme of acad emic and social development. A statistical meta-analysis (random effects model) reveal ed that these approaches reduced by 39% the number of young women reporting teenage pregna ncy (Relative Risk = 0.61, 95% CI 0.48, 0.77), and also had positive effects on empl oyment and economic status. The qualitative research revealed three recurrent themes in the experiences of young people: dislike of school; poor material circumstances and unhapp y childhoods; and low expectations for the future. Any information on theoretical models used in included studies No Authors conclusions The review concludes that there are strong grounds for investing in early childhood and youth development programmes as strategies for reduc ing unintended teenage pregnancy rates. Happiness, enjoyment of school and am bition can all help to delay early parenthood.............Studies of you ng people's views suggest many important research gaps. These include the development and evaluati on of policies to promote young people's involvement in schooling, further education and training, and to support families experiencing problems linked with social disadvantage and poverty. 26Citation Harden A, Weston R & Oakley A (1999) A Review Of The Effectiveness And Appropriateness of Peer Delivered Health Pr omotion Interventions For Young People.

There were two relevant ( i.e to minimise risk of pregnancy) interventions and these were both in school settings: 1)Fox et al. (1993) evaluated a pee r-delivered intervention which aimed to provide young people in Norwic h, in the UK, with insight into issues connected with early parenthood; to provide support and training to the peer leaders (young mothers aged 17 to 26) and to enable th ese young women to acquire a range of communication skills, self-confidence and self-wor th. The peer leaders delivered sessions covering the realities of being a young mother (e .g. the cost of being a single parent) and information on contraception in youth clubs and schools, using presentations, discussion, quizzes and question-and-answer sessions. Overa ll the authors concluded, in terms of implementation, that extended sessions in the in tervention were needed, older adults (as long as they were not teachers) did not affect the delivery of the intervention, the intervention should narrow its focus to one topic (e.g. the realities of being a young parent) and that the intervention should be incorporated into a wide r programme of sex education. In addition, they question whether school culture can accomm odate peer education and suggest it may be more suited to youth club settings. 2) Schonbach (1995) evaluated a sexual health intervention implemented in secondary school in Germany, which aimed to train a group of young people to educate their peers on sexuality, love, partners hip, pregnancy prevention and STDs through one off-class sessions using in teractive teaching methods. Principles of 'empowerment' informed this project: revealed that in general they felt their sessions had been positively received but they had difficulty dealing with some situations arising in the classroom (e.g. how to get everyone to participate), and female only sessions went better than male-only sessions. Views on the training revealed that a non-traditional relationship between the trainer and peer educator contributed to eagerness to learn and motivation. The peer educators felt themselves to be more self-conf ident and open. Overall, the authors concluded that the peer education project demonstrated all the principles of 'good practice' in health promotion, including empowerment and particip ation. More specifically, they recommended that the intervals between the training sessions should be shortened to maintain enthusiasm and commitment, and that training should ensu re more emphasis on how to conduct a class. Any information on theoretical models used in included studies Yes - one of quality assesment criteria 27Authors conclusions Although peer-delivered health promotion has ta rgeted a wide range of health areas and has been implemented in several different settings, most of this work to date has focused on smoking, alcohol or other drug use and sexual health (both pregnancy prevention and the prevention of STDs). Most of it has been impl emented within educati onal settings, has tended to be classroom-based and involve the provision of information or the development of skills. Peer-delivered interventions have been less likely to be conducted in the community or to use other intervention strategies such as the fostering of social support. Most of the interventions used peer leaders of the same age as the targ et population. This suggests that it is widely assumed that parity of age establishes the boundary of one's peer group. Several characteristics of peer-delivered health prom otion interventions located for this review suggest that most interventions have been implemented using a 'top-down' process. When stated, interventions were more likely to be based on 'normative need' (the opinion of 'experts' as to what is needed) rather than 'felt' need (the views of the target population on what they need). Although nearly half of the in terventions gave an indication that they were developed with some input from the target population or peer leaders, this was likely to be confined to one component of an otherwise highly prescribed (researcher or practitioner-led) intervention. There was a relationship between type of evaluation and use of 'top-down' procedures for planning and developing peer-d elivered interventions: outcome evaluations were less likely to be based on 'felt need' an d less likely to develop interventions in partnership with the target population 28Citation Kavanagh J, Trouton A, Oakley A & Powell C (2006) A systematic review of the evidencefor incentive schemes to encouragepositive health and other social behaviours in young people.

Study Population Young people 11-19y Results The searches produced 9,843 records. These were narrowed down to a total of 181 reports of 129 separate studies which were in cluded in the first, mapping stage of the review. The majority of studies were conducted in the USA (N=88), with only 28 studies being carried out in the UK. A wide range of incentives was employed, from cash payments to entry into raffles or lotter ies. Financial incentives in the form of cash payments or reduced-cost access to a range of resources were used in over half of the studies. Many studies covered more th an one topic area. Fi fty studies described a focus on one or more health behaviours, 61 upon at least one e ducational behaviour, and 32 studies focused on one or more social behaviours. Eight studies focused on pregnancy prevention, and an example of the type of incentive is the 'Dollar a day' programme, where teenage mothers were gi ven a dollar a day given for every day they were not pregnant at a monthly pre gnancy test. Sixteen outcome evaluations met the inclusion criteria and were judged to be methodologically sound. Analysis of these studies showed that single or dual component incentive schemes are effective in encouraging positive health behaviours where a simple or single action is required, rather than a sustained health behaviour cha nge. The initial review identified a total of 34 process evaluations focused on one or more areas of health behaviour. Seven studies focused on pregnancy prevention. Sixteen trials from the total were included in the in-depth review, only seven provi ded formal process evaluations, which indicated the following: a) The required be haviours need to be logged and rewarded consistently b) interventions designed to foster the required behaviour need to be implemented properly and consistently c) Large-scale incentive-based schemes in particular require staff with the necessary skills and commitment to supporting young people through a scheme, and in turn such schemes require sound systems in place to support them d) Consideration should be gi ven to ensuring that the size or type of incentive on offer is sufficient to motivate change in young people. Any information on theoretical models used in included studies No Authors conclusions 29Overall single or dual component incentive schem es do not appear to offer policy-makers or practitioners a simple route to ensuring gene ral positive behaviour changes in young people. However, they may be useful in partic ular settings and for particular groups. 30Citation Korenbrot Bender C & Newberry S (2002): Preconception care: a systematic review.

The review included studies that addressed four problem areas and the following interventions:1) Pregnanc ies with any preconception risk condition (1 RCT and 1 retrospective observational study): the RCT (100 women with negative pregnancy tests) found that preconception care (risk assessment, patients education about risks, and referral where required) did not increase the proportion of women who had at least one preconception risk addressed by their primary care physician (78% with preconception care versus 76% with no preconception care). The observational study (1,378 women) found that preconception care was associat ed with increased rates of intended pregnancy among low- income women. The relative risk for intended pregnancy for preconception care versus usual family planning services was 1.52 (95% confiden ce interval: 0.98, 2.36, only 22% with preconception care. 2) Anatomical congenital anomalies (2 RCTs and 3 CCTs): all 5 studies found that preconception folic acid reduced neural tube defects 3) Diabetes mellitus (1 CCT and 6 observational studies): all 4 studies presenting results for glycaemic control (glyco sylated haemoglobin, fasting or postprandial blood glucose) found that preconception care was associated with improved control in early pregnancy. Other positive outcomes with preconception care included: fewer maternal hospitalisations, a reduced use of neonatal intens ive care (1.1 days versus 3.9 days in one study); a reduced prevalence of major congen ital anomalies, though not all reductions were statistically significant (1.2 to 5% with prec onception care versus 10.9 to 14% for control); and a reduction in foetal and neonatal deaths (6.5% with preconception care control, 4) Hyperphenylala ninemia (1 CCT and 3 observational studies): all 4 studies found that reduced maternal phenylket onuria was associated with one or more improved neonatal outcomes (birth weight, h ead circumference, congenital anomalies and neonatal deaths). One study found no associati on between preconception dietary control and improved neonatal outcomes. Three studies f ound that preconception care reduced congenital anomalies. Any information on theoretical models used in included studies No Authors conclusions Professionals working in maternal and child hea lth need to encourage the concept of readiness for pregnancy and ensure that women are as h ealthy and appropriately nourished as possible before they become pregnant. 31Reviewers'comments CRD commentary: The review question was clear in terms of the study design, intervention, participants and outcomes. Limiting the incl uded studies to English language publications listed in one database may have omitted some rele vant studies. No attempt was made to locate unpublished studies, thus raising the possibility of publication bias. Two reviewers selected the studies and this reduced the potential for bi as and errors. However, the methods used to extract the data were not described, hence th e adequacy of the methods used cannot be judged. The validity of the included studi es was not assessed. A narrative synthesis was appropriate given the small number of studies. Findings from the studies were discussed without considering the quality of the evidence and differences between the studies were not explored. The review could be criticised fo r the way it selected the problems it addressed: only those preconception risks addressed by two or more studies were included in the review. Thus, clinically important issues may have b een omitted. The evidence presented appears to support the authors' conclusion 32Citation Moos MK, Bartholomew NE & Lohr KN (2003): Counseling in the clinical setting to prevent unintended pregnancy: an evidence-based research agenda.

Study design Systematic review Types of study included Experimental, cohort designs, cross-sect ional studies, or qualitative methodology, Geographical scope USA, and English language, only Dates covered by review/meta-analysis 1985-2000 Focus e.g. topic or approach relevant to current review Teenage pregnancy Objectives of study To assess the effect of counselling in a clini cal setting in the USA to prevent unintended pregnancy in adults and adolescents, an d to make recommendations for research Study Population Pregnant teenagers aged 12 to 19 years ; male s aged 15 to 18 years who were enrolled in a Health Maintenance Organisation (91% white ); women younger than 20 years who were attending a family planning clinic (FPC ) for contraception (5% white, 41% African American, 50% Hispanic); and females younger than 18 years who were attending a FPC (98% white) Results Four studies addressed the effectiveness of c ounselling: one RCT (1,449 males), one cohort with retrospective analysis (79 females) and two longitudinal studies (one with 823 females and one with 1,256 females). The included studies were of slide presentation plus reproductive health consultation with a health professional compared with control; traditional counselling compared with contingency pl anning counselling; individual and group interventions as part of a wider programme; and experimental counseling There was no good- quality evidence available to assess the effectiv eness of counselling. The four studies were not well designed and had poor internal and extern al validity. The interventions were diverse and could not be compared. One RCT (1,449 teenage boys) showed no significant difference in the proportion who were sexually active 1 year post- intervention, but showed that the intervention significantly increased cont raceptive use and knowledge about STDs. Methodological flaws included the potential fo r selection bias (high rates of refusal to participate), a nonrepresentative population (highe r income white males) and the lack of intention-to-treat analysis. One cohort study (79 pregnant teenagers) showed that at 6 months the programme significantly increased contracep tive use and knowledge between teenagers with and with no repeat pregnancy, but found no significant difference at 2 years. The number of participants followed up at 2 years was small. Methodological flaws included the small sample size, an unvalidated questionnaire a nd a high drop-out rate. One longitudinal study (823 women attending a FPC) showed no si gnificant difference between enhanced contingency planning a nd conventional family planning in continuing the use of contraception at 1 year. Methodological flaws included the potential for selection bias, few details of the participants and a high drop-out rate. One longitudinal study (1,256 teenagers attending a FPC) showed that clinics using experimental counselling significantly increased continued use of contraception and had fewer problems w ith the chosen method than nonexperimental clinics. Methodological flaws included the potential for selection bias, the potential for non- comparable treatment groups and a high drop-out rate. No experimental studies that analysed harms were identified. The review also cons idered factors influencing contraceptive use, identified in the individual studies. fFor example motivational factors which the authors of one study believe family-planni ng practitioners should consider in their counseling are: reservations about the method to be used, part ner support of the method and beliefs about own fertility. In another study inconsistency of contraceptives was best predicted by negative experiences that close friends had, low levels of perceived susceptibility to pregnancy, 33alcohol consumption, concern about becoming too old to have children, a preference for nonromantic sex and the partner's unwillingness to refrain from sex if the diaphragm was not in place. A further study identified three gr oups of women who were taking contraceptive pills but had significantly elevated numbers of unprotected days: those with a lower level of perceived partner support for effective pill u se, unmarried women and those who did not consider it especially important to avoid pre gnancy. The following behaviors were associated with improved adherence: took pill at same time every day; read and understood all of package information and took the pill at a routine time other than right before bed. Finally teenage pregnancy was associated with subjects who come from a community where adolescent pregnancy rates are high, often occurring across generations, and socially tolerated, thereby making external validity a bout contraceptive motivations and use poor. The authors of this study concluded that \"clinical a ttempts to identify adolescent patients at risk of pregnancy using only one or two cr iteria will probably be unsuccessful\". Any information on theoretical models used in included studies The authors said that it was difficult to assess th e theorectical underpinnings of the included studies Authors conclusions There were insufficient good-quality studies to assess the effectiveness of counselling on unintended pregnancy. Reviewers'comments CRD commentary: The review question was clear in terms of the study design and intervention, but the inclusion criteria for the participants and outcomes were not defined. Several relevant sources were searched and the search terms were stated. Two reviewers independently selected the studies, which re duces the potential for bias and errors. The methods used to assess validity and extract the da ta were not described. Hence, efforts made to reduce errors and bias cannot be judged. Validity was assessed a nd the results were presented in the data extraction tables, along with relevant information on the included studies. A narrative synthesis was appropriate gi ven the small number of studies. The results were summarised, taking account of study validity, and some of the limitations of the review were discussed. The evidence presented appear s to support the authors' conclusions. 34Citation Palda VA, Guise JM, Wathen CN & the Canadian Task Force on Preventive Health C (2003): Interventions to promote breastfeeding: updated recommendations from the Canadian Task Force on Preventive Health Care.

English Language. Dates covered by review/meta-analysis 1966-2000 Focus e.g. topic or approach relevant to current review Breastfeeding Objectives of study To update counselling recommendations as a join t review with the United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF), using revised methodology and addressing new evidence, restricted to developed countries, where breast feeding rates and effectiveness of interventions to promote breastfeeding can differ from conditi ons in developing countries. To present the current status of breastfeeding in Canada, a su mmary of the collaborative systematic review, and updated CTFPHC recommendations Study Population Women Results Individual or group educational sessions lasting 30-90 minutes may increase breastfeeding initiation and short-term duration rates by 20-30% (lev el I, fair (6 studies) poor (5 studies)). In-person or telephone support by itself may increase short- and long-term breastfeeding rates (level I, fair (6), poor (2)). In-pers on or telephone support stre ngthens the effect of education by an additional 5-10% increase in br eastfeeding initiation and short-term duration (level I, fair (4)). Written materials are not effective either alone or in combination with other methods (level I, good(1), fair(3), poor(4)). Peer counselling increases initiation and duration of breastfeeding (level I, fair (1), poor (1), level II-1, poor (4)). There is insufficient evidence regarding rooming-in ( no adequate studies), early maternal contact (level I, meta-analysis indicating no effect) and primary provider c ounseling (no adequate studies). Commercial discharge packages a ppear to decrease the rates of exclusive breastfeeding (level I, good, Cochrane review of 9 RCTs). Any information on theoretical models used in included studies No Authors conclusions There is: good evidence to recommend providing structured antepartum educational programs and postpartum support to promote breastfeedi ng initiation and duration; fair evidence to recommend peer counseling to promote initiati on and maintenance of breastfeeding.; good evidence to recommend against providing written materials alone to promote breastfeeding; insufficient evidence to make a recommendati on regarding advice by primary caregivers to promote breastfeeding; good evidence to recommend against providing commercial discharge packages to new mothers; no new evidence of compelling quality to overturn the earlier published recommendation in favour of room ing in and early maternal contact 35Citation Rees R, Harden A, Shepherd J, Brunton G, Oliver S & Oakley A (2001) Young people and physical activity: a systematic review of r esearch on barriers and facilitators.

Study design Systematic review Types of study included All types Geographical scope Non intervention studies from UK only included Dates covered by review/meta-analysis Cut off of 1990 for non intervention research Focus e.g. topic or approach relevant to current review Physical activity Objectives of study To provide practitioners, policy- makers and researchers with a summary of evidence to help them develop, implement and evaluate interv entions for promoting physical activity amongst young people, with a particular focus on young people from socially excluded groups and upon interventions targeting stru ctural or environmental (e.g. access to facilities) barriers to physical activity. Study Population Young people 11-16y Results A total of 28 studies met the inclusion criteria: 16 examined young peoples views and 12 were potentially rigorous evaluations of the effectiveness of interventions. Many of the interventions were evaluated in schools, some of which also extended activities into the home and the community through seeking parental involvement. Peer influence was also explored. Reliable evidence on the effectiveness of these efforts was, however, scare. When positive effects were detected these were restricted to young women. In terms of young peoples views, the vast majority saw physical activity as beneficial for both health and social reasons. Young women particularly valued the role of physi cal activity in maintaining weight and a toned figure, but unlike young men, they found that physical activity did not fit in well with their leisure time. Ideas for promoting physical activ ity included: increasing or modifying practical and material resources, such as creating more cycle lanes, making activities more affordable, increasing access to clubs for dancing, and combin ing sports with leisure facilities; and more 'non-traditional' activities to choose from in school PE Any information on theoretical models used in included studies Yes Authors conclusions A comparison across study types suggest major gaps for research and development. The effectiveness of interventions that address or build on young peoples ideas have yet to be sufficiently evaluated. This is the case for the need for less traditional school-based activities including dance and aerobics, for modifications to PE organisation and teaching, for additional community and personal resources or materials 36Citation Reid M & Adamson H (1998) Opportunities for and barriers to good nutritional health in women of childbearing age, pregnant women, in fants under 1, and children aged 1-5.

Study Population Women in maternity care and/or health care professionals such as doctors or midwives who were responsible for providing maternity care. Results Eleven studies were included in the review; th e total number of participants was at least 10,808. Ten of these studies were parallel-group randomised trials which focused on aspects of antenatal care (insufficient data to calculate the overall total number of participants). The other study was a cluster randomised trial of 13 hospitals grouped into ten clusters, covering information about antenatal and intrapartum ca re. Five trials were concerned with the presentation of information in relation to antenata l testing. Three trials compared the use of woman-held maternity records with standard cooperation cards. Two trials compared the use of a computer-based questionnaire for history-taking at the first antenatal (booking) appointment with different types of a manual checklist. In the remaining study, the staff at maternity units were supplied with evidence-based leaflets and given training in their use with women; the women's informed choice at th ese units was then compared with women receiving standard care at other units. The trials reviewed rarely provi ded sufficient detailed information to afford an assessment on all the valid ity criteria. In addition, several trials were methodologically weak, with only two using an acceptable randomisation method. Further details on the findings of the methodological ass essment were reported in the review. Four trials in which women were provided with add itional information about antenatal testing in a variety of formats suggested that this was valued by the women and may reduce anxiety. Communication skills training for midwives and doctors improved their information about giving antenatal tests. Three trials of woma n-held maternity records suggested that these increase the women's involvement in and control over their care. Any information on theoretical models used in included studies No Authors conclusions The review pointed to potentially useful inte rventions for improving communication between health professionals and women in maternity care, in a limited number of areas. Extra information about antenatal testing provided in detailed leaflets, or in individual advice sessions, may reduce anxiety about testing and may alter the uptake of some specific tests. However, it is unclear whether it prompts a mo re appropriate uptake. Focused communication skills training for midwives and doctors may also be of benefit. Woman-held maternity records also bring benefits to women in terms of their perceived involvement in and control over their care. The lack of trials of interventions aimed at promoting shared decision-making, and at increasing the involvement of women in their care in other ways, is disappointing 38Reviewers'comments CRD commentary: The review question and the st udy selection criteria were stated clearly. The literature search seems to have been reasona bly comprehensive, with no date or language restrictions applied, although th e authors state that no systematic attempt was made to identify unpublished sources; this may have resulted in some studies being missed. The decision not to pool results from the individual studies for a meta-analysis seemed appropriate given the heterogeneity of the data in the included studi es. The authors' conclusions seem appropriately cautious given the findings presented and the methodological weaknesses of several of the included studies. 39Citation Rowe RE, Garcia J & Davidson LL (2004): Soci al and ethnic inequalities in the offer and uptake of prenatal screening and diagnosis in th e UK: a systematic review.

Twenty met the inclusion criteria. The studies included covered screeni ng and/or diagnosis for Down's syndrome, neural tube defects, haemoglobin disorders and HIV. Many studies were limited by small numbers or poor reporting of data and analysis . Six studies reported data on prenatal testing according to women's social class or educationa l level. None found any significant social inequalities in testing. Some studies suggested that women of South Asian origin might be up to 70% less likely to receive prenatal testing for haemoglobin disorders and Down's syndrome than White women. A small number of studies suggested that South Asian women might be less likely to be offered testing. Any information on theoretical models used in included studies No Authors conclusions This review provides some evidence of ethnic inequalities in access to prenatal testing. Further research is required to improve our unders tanding of why testing may not be offered, the reasons for failure to take up testing when offered, and to identify whether there are other social inequalities in access to prenatal testing. 40Citation Saraiya M, Glanz K, Briss PA, Nichols P, White C, Das D, Smith SJ, Tannor B, Hutchinson AB, Wilson KM, Gandhi N, Lee NC, Rimer B, Coates RC, Kerner JF, Hiatt RA, Buffler P & Rochester P (2004): Interventions to prevent sk in cancer by reducing exposure to ultraviolet radiation: a systematic review.

Study Population General population Results Detailed results are provided, and were cate gorised as follows:? Educational and policy interventions in child care settings - Educati onal and policy interventions in primary schools - Educational and policy interventions in sec ondary schools and colleges - Educational and policy interventions in recreational and touris m settings - Programs in outdoor occupational settings - Healthcare system and provider settings. The focus of the results is the effectiveness of interventions in the different categories. Any information on theoretical models used in included studies The authors note that few reports describ ed the theoretical b asis for the research. Authors conclusions The Task Force on Community Preventive Services found that education and policy approaches to increasing sun-protective behavi ors were effective when implemented in primary schools and in recreational or touris m settings, but found insufficient evidence to determine effectiveness when implemented in other settings, such as child care centers, secondary schools and colleges, and occupationa l settings. They also found insufficient evidence to determine the effec tiveness of interventions orient ed to healthcare settings and providers, media campaigns alone, interventions or iented to parents or caregivers of children, and community-wide multicomponent interventions . The report also provides suggestions for areas for future research. 41Citation Scottish Executive (2003) Enhancing Sexual Wellbeing In Scotland: A Sexual Health Relationship Strategy.

Study Population Young people Results 1) School based sex and relationships education, particularly linked to contraception services, youth development services, community based e ducation and the inclusion of parents in information and prevention programmes have been shown to help in reducing teenage pregnancy (NHSCRD 1997, DiCenso et al 2002 , Cheesborough et al 1999, Franklin et al 1997, Grunseit A 1997, Kane and Wellings 1999, Kirby 2001, P eckham et al 1996). 2) In their evidence review of effective interv entions on reducing teenage pregnancy and parenthood, Swann et al (2003) identified the following characteristics of services and interventions: Focus on improving contraceptive use and at least one other behaviour likely to prevent pregnancy and/or STI transmission Long term services and interventions Focus on high risk groups and working through opinion l eaders and peer educators Services which are accessible, for example in terms of location, staff attitude, opening hours and confidentiality Encouraging an open and non judgemental discussion about sex, sexuality and contraception Inclusion of personal skills development such as negotiation and refusal skills Having a multl agency approach and working with communities 3) Evidence also suggests that good antenatal care, parental, ps ychological, social and educational support may help improve health and educational outcomes for young mums and their children (NHSCRD 1997). There are however, a number of areas where little or no evidence is available to demonstrate effective interventions: these incl ude interventions aimed at those facing the greatest barriers to positive sexual health (fo r example looked after young people, those excluded from school), young men and the links be tween deprivation and teenage pregnancy. 4) Providing pregnant mums and teenage pare nts with increased opportunities to continue their education can give them the skills to ga in future employment 5) Fullerton (HEBS, 2002) states that there is currently little reliable UK evidence which identif ies interventions to prevent unintended pregnancies among teenagers. Nevertheless, evidence is available to suggest that creative programmes, whether desi gned to prevent teenage pregnancy or support teenage parents are more holistic in approach and aim to address some of the identified factors associated with risk. This highlights the need for multi-component approaches aimed at preventing pregnancy and/or poor outc omes associated with unintended pregnancy.

Two soundly evaluated interventions used peer education. However there was less evidence favouring peer education in the area of mental health as compared with healthy eating and physical activity. b) the evidence for the effectiv eness of interventions to promote better family relations is mixed 3) Self: young people can be motivated to take part in physical activity because of the sense of achievement it engenders, and willpower was seen as something that might help them for a healthy diet - although others fe lt apathetic and/or pressurised. Older teenagers were worried about financial security and employment prospects, and physical activity was sometimes prohibited by costs, for example of travel. On the other hand, e.g.fast foods and were seen as cheap. Any information on theoretical models used in included studies No Authors conclusions 1) General - multi component interventions are recommended wherever possible 2) in relation to physical activity ( and healthy eating) the whole school approach appears to be important; feedback over a prolonged period in relation to achieving agreed objectives; peer led interventions may be particularly useful fo r young women; interventions which employ teachers need to allocate sufficient time for trai ning, and research is needed to promote better teacher student relationships 43Citation Tedstone A, Dunce N, Aviles M, Shetty P & Daniles L (1998) Effectiveness of intervention to promote healthy feeding in infants under one year of age: a review.

Study Population Carers of children aged 0-1y Results 20 studies were identified which were interventions to promote breast-feeding. The most successful breast-feeding promotions were based in the USA and in the general were long term, spanning the pre-and post-na tal period and intensive, involving multiple contacts with a professional breast-feeding promoter or peer c ounsellor. Weaker evidence from single studies suggests that including partners or incentives and changing the contents of the Commercial Hospital Discharge packs may facilitate breast feeding. Th e least successful breast-feeding promotions were implemented dur ing the post natal period only, or in countries other than the USA, where breast-feeding prevalence is relativel y low. The least successful were also those that involved multiple health promotion programmes where breast-feeding promotion was one of a number of components, special visits to the hospital or clinic in addition to routine visits, or where post natal suppor t was provided by telephone only. Any information on theoretical models used in included studies No Authors conclusions There is an urgent need to develop eff ective breast-feeding promotional packages to encourage this the initiation and maintenance of breast-feeding in the UK setting. There is currently insufficient evidence to predict the design of successful programmes. Breast feeding promotion strategies should be directed at groups with particularly low breast-feeding initiation rates. There is some evidence to s uggest that programmes that incorporate peer support initiatives maybe successful. It is alos im portant to investigate the potential role of midwives and health visitors in breast-feeding prom otion. There is also a need to investigate the usefulness of targeting women prior to pr egnancy and their partners, in breast-feeding campaigns.

Study Population Women 18-74y Results Ten RCTs (n=20,722) were included in the meta -analysis. The pooled OR (fixed-effect) for the 10 RCTs indicated that patients who received the intervention were significantly more likely to return for screening than those who di d not (OR 1.64, 95% confidence interval, CI: 1.49, 1.80). Significant heterogeneity was found between studies (chi-squared 31, d.f.=9, P<0.001). The heterogeneity was resolved by di viding the studies into subpopulations based on socioeconomic status (chi-squared 5.2, d.f.=8, P=0.75). The studies evaluating those in lower socioeconomic groups had a smaller respon se (OR 1.16, 95% CI: 0.99, 1.35) than those studies with mixed populations (OR 2.02, 95% CI: 1.79, 2.28). The results obtained using a random-effects model were similar to t hose obtained using a fixed-effect model Any information on theoretical models used in included studies No Authors conclusions Patient reminders in the form of mailed letters increase the rate of cervical cancer screening. Patient letter reminders have less e fficacy in lower socioeconomic groups. Reviewers'comments CRD commentary: This meta-analysis was base d on a review question that was reasonably well defined in terms of the relevant interven tions and study designs. An adequate search of the literature was undertaken, which included a ttempts to identify unpublished studies. Some aspects of the validity of the individual studies we re discussed in the text of the review, but no attempt was made to systematically evalua te the methodological quality of each included study. Consequently, the relative validity of the results of the included RCTs is neither apparent to the reader nor considered in the sy nthesis. Some relevant details of the included studies were presented in the text and tables of the review; further information, such as how the interventions were implemented, would have been useful. The authors used appropriate statistical methods to synthesise the results a nd measure heterogeneity. In addition, potential sources of heterogeneity were investigated appr opriately.The authors' conclusions appear to follow from the evidence presented, but the above considerations should be borne in mind when interpreting these conclusions. 45APPENDIX 2b: Review 1 papers for which abstracts were downloaded, but which were excluded from the study (n=69), with reasons for exclusion .

The importance of preconception care in the continuum of women's health care. Obstet Gynecol 106, 665-666. Study Design Expert Committee Geographical Scope USA Study Population NA Objectives of Study Nearly half of all pregnancies in the United St ates are unintended. Therefore, the challenge of preconception care lies not only in addressi ng pregnancy planning for women who seek medical care and consultation specifically in an ticipation of a planned pregnancy but also in educating and screening all reproductively capable women on an ongoing basis to identify potential maternal and fetal risks and hazards to pregnancy before and between pregnancies. Methods Committee Opinion Results Clinicians should encourage women to formul ate a reproductive health plan and should discuss it in a nondirective way at each visit. Su ch a plan would address the individual's or couple's desire for a child or children (or desi re not to have children); the optimal number, spacing, and timing of children in the family ; and age-related changes in fertility. Because many women's plans change over time, creati ng a reproductive health plan requires an ongoing conscientious assessment of the desirability of a future pregnancy, determination of steps that need to be taken either to preven t or to plan for and optimize a pregnancy, and evaluation of current health status and other issues relevant to the health of a pregnancy. Any information on theoretical models No Authors conclusions The goal of preconception care is to reduce the ri sk of adverse health effects for the woman, fetus, or neonate by optimizing the woman' s health and knowledge before planning and conceiving a pregnancy. Because reproductive cap acity spans almost four decades for most women, optimizing women's health before and between pregnancies is an ongoing process that requires access to and the full participation of all segments of the health care system. 52Citation Bernstein PS, Sanghvi T & Merkatz IR (2000): Improving preconception care.

A secondary goal was to evaluate the knowledge and awaren ess of providers regarding preconception care Methods A preintervention chart review of a conve nience sample of non-pregnant women with reproductive potential who attend an inner city hospital gynecology clinic (n = 100) was conducted to evaluate delivery of preconception care. Items screened for included: family planning services, domestic violence, nutrition and medical risk factors, medication use, appropriate counseling and use of referral services. All providers in the clinic were surveyed to assess their knowledge of and attitudes toward preconception care. A two-part intervention was then carried out: (1) a one-hour lecture for all providers, and (2) a standardized preconception care form inserted in all charts . A postintervention chart review of a second convenience sample (n = 100) and repeat provide r survey were then conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the two interventions. Results Following the two-pronged intervention, there was evidence of improved documentation of the delivery of preconception care. Documentati on of screening in almost all categories was significantly improved (P < .05). The greatest improvements were noted in complete screening for medical risk factors (from 15% to 44%), for over-the-counter and prescription medication use (from 10% to 70% and 30% to 77%, respectively), domestic violence (from 10% to 57%) and nutrition (from 9% to 50%). Ho wever, provider knowledge of and attitudes toward preconception care were not significantly changed Any information on theoretical models No Authors conclusions The combination of education about preconcepti on care and insertion of a standardized form into a patient's chart led to a clear improvem ent in the documentation of preconception care. Given the significance of preconception care, insertion of a standardized form should be considered to help providers complete and appropriate care to their patients. 53Citation Boulet SL, Johnson K, Parker C, Posner SF & Atrash H (2006a): A Perspective of Preconception Health Activities in the United States.

Detailed information is provided by timeline and by geographical location. Any information on theoretical models No Authors conclusions The wider application of the core component s of preconception care (i.e., risk assessment, health promotion, and intervention) has the pot ential to enhance the health and overall well- being of women, infants, and children around the globe. In light of the numerous factors influencing pregnancy outcome, an integrated approach to preconception health promotion has been proposed as perhaps the most eff ective and efficient means of implementing preconception health care The benefits of service integration are apparent in even the most resource-poor settings, as evidenced by the introduction and expansion of the WHO's strategy, the Integrated Management of Childho od Illness, in various countries. Indeed, the perspective that preconception care is part of a larger continuum of care is well aligned with a prevention-focused public health paradigm . As such, the widespread promotion of preconception health may be the most timely a nd logical step toward ensuring global health. 55Citation Centers for Disease Control and Preventi on (2006) Recommendations to improve preconception health and health care - United States: a report of the CDC/ATSDR Preconception care work group and the Select Panel on Preconception Care MMWR 55., Atlanta, USA Study Design Expert opinion + literature review Geographical Scope USA Study Population NA Objectives of Study To provide recommendations to improve both preconception health and care. The goal of these recommendations is to improve the health of women and couples, before conception of a first or subsequent pregnancy. Methods CDC developed these recommendations based on a review of published research and the opinions of specialists from the CDC/ATSDR Preconception Care Work Group and the Select Panel on Preconception Care Results Detailed results are provided. The following po ints were selected as being relevant to the current review:- 1) A list of core interventions exist that are part of preconception care services. These interventions are risk-specific; providers can screen and provide appropriate interventions for persons who need them. However, the best evidence for the effectiveness of these specific components of preconception care has been documented when the focu s of delivery was on a single risk behavior and accompanying intervention, rather than delivery of multiple interventions. 2) Interventions that address multiple pregnancy-related risk behaviors simultaneously have not been systematically evaluated and are less commonly delivered...........One study has reported the effectiveness of comprehensive preconception care; however, the findings have limited applicability for the implementation of preconception health-care services in the United States because the study was conducted in Hungary 3) Whereas the evidence supporting specific in terventions and the importance of intervening before pregnancy are defin itive, limited evidence is available to determine effective methods for delivering preconception care and improving preconception health. Only a limited number of studies regarding effectiveness of interventions have been tested for increasing preconception screening, counseling, and intervention in primary care settings. In one randomized clinical trial, preconception risk factors were identified among women who sought care at a hospital primary care clinic for a pregnancy test. In this trial, an average of nine risk factors per woman was identified at the time of a negative pregnancy test. However, notifying wome n and their clinicians of identified preconception risks did not improve intervention rates. In another study in which didactic lectures and chart cues were u sed, significant increases occurred in risk screening for medical risk factors (15%-44%), medications (10%- 30%), domestic violence (10%-57%), and nutr women who attended an innercity hos pital gynecologic clinic. However, intervention rates and provider attitudes toward preconception care did not change substantially. A prospective study of the effect of preconception health promotion on intendedness of pregnancy revealed that women in a family planning clinic who had received the in tervention (22%) during routine visits 56were more likely to report intended pregna ncies than those patients in the same clinic who were not exposed to the intervention 4) A limited number of studies have assessed the best methods for integrating interventions to achieve maximum impact and optimize the use of limited resources. As with other types of preventive care services, time constraints limit physicians' ability to deliver health pr omotion interventions. a) Preconception care interventions can potentially be integrated into a limited number of model visits to focus on specific content at different visits, as is done for well-child care . b) Integrated and coordinated care services might also provide additional support to improve health outcomes. For example, an evaluation of the quality of care in the National Centers of Exce llence in Women's Health indicated that women served in these centers, compared with community samples, received more clinical preventive services and had hi gher satisfaction levels .c) Another approach (e.g., self-management) to in tegrated service of delivery has been illustrated in CDC's recommendations in Strategies for Reducing Morbidity and Mortality from Diabetes Through Hea lth-Care System Interventions and Diabetes Self-Management Education in Community Settings: A Report on Recommendations of the Task Force on Community Preventive Services 5) Preconception care should be tailored to meet the needs of the individual woman. Because preconception care needs to be provided across the lifespan and not during only one visit, certain re commendations will be more relevant to women at different life stages and with varying levels of risk. Health promotion, risk screening, and interventions are different for a young woman who has never experienced pregnancy than for a woman aged 35 years who has had three children. Any information on theoretical models No Authors conclusions Recommendation 1. Individual Responsibility Across the Lifespan. Each woman, man, and couple should be encouraged to have a reproductive life plan. Recommendation 2. Consumer Awareness. Increase public awareness of the importance of preconception health behaviors and precon ception care services by using information and tools appropriate across various ages; literacy, including health literacy; and cultural/linguistic contexts. a) Consumer s should be more involved in improving preconception care services. b) Activities specifically designed to improve school general health education are an essential step in im proving reproductive awareness. c) Efforts to inform adults regarding the risks and oppor tunities to improve their health are equally important. d) Success in improving preconception health will require changes in public. A critical tool for stimulating these changes is so cial marketing, e) Consumer-friendly tools can help women self-assess risks, make plans, and ta ke actions that will improve their health and that of their children. Recommendation 3. Preventive Visits. As a part of primary care visits, provide risk assessment and educational and health promo tion counseling to all women of childbearing age to reduce reproductive risks and improve pregnancy outcomes. Recommendation 4. Interventions for Identifie d Risks. Increase the proportion of women who receive interventions as follow-up to pr econception risk screening, focusing on high priority interventions (i.e., those with ev idence of effectiveness and greatest potential impact). Recommendation 5. Interconception Care. Use the interconception period to provide additional intensive interventions to women w ho have had a previous pregnancy that ended in an adverse outcome Recommendation 6. Prepregnancy Checkup. Offer, as a component of maternity care, one prepregnancy visit for couples and pe rsons planning pregnancy. Recommendation 7. Health Insurance Coverage for Women with Low Incomes. Increase public and private health insurance coverage fo r women with low incomes to improve access 57to preventive women's health and preconcep tion and interconception care. Recommendation 8. Public Health Programs a nd Strategies. Integrate components of preconception health into existing local public health and related programs, Recommendation 9. Research. Increase the evid ence base and promote the use of the evidence to improve preconception health. Recommendation 10. Monitoring Improvements. Maximize public health surveillance and related research mechanisms to monitor preconception health. 58Citation Czeizel AE (1999): Ten years J Obstet Gynecol Reprod Biol 84, 43-49. Study Design Prospective study Geographical Scope Hungary Study Population Fertile, non pregnant, female volunteers. The final sample was of a higher socioeconomic class than the population as a whole. Objectives of Study To describe the methods of the periconceptional care, consisting of counselling, examinations and medical intervention in Hungary Methods The Hungarian periconceptional care programme consists of three steps: check-up of reproductive health (i.e. preconceptional screeni ng), the 3-month preparation for conception, and better protection in early pregnancy. Da ta from 8837 female and 7600 male participants from the coordinating centre of the Hungarian periconceptional care between 1 February 1984 and 31 January 1994 were summarized. Results Mean maternal age was 25.8+/-3.4 years, 84 and 60% of female participants were primiparae, and had high education (> or = 13 classes), resp ectively. It was possible to establish that periconceptional care can be performed and/or supervised by qualified nurses. Participants with positive family history, case history and wh ere genitourinary infections were detected, had a more effective flow towards secondary care. Infertile couples were diagnosed and treated sooner. The periconceptional car e was effective for the introduction of periconceptional folic acid/multivitamin suppl ementation and for the reduction of smoking and alcohol consumption in females in the preconceptional period. The rate of major congenital abnormalities (20.6/1000) was signi ficantly lower than expected (35/1000). Any information on theoretical models No Authors conclusions Periconceptional care is feasible and has ma ny benefits. Thus, proper preparation for conception is the earliest and probably the most important method of health promotion in general, particularly for the prevention of c ongenital abnormalities.(Note: the full text of the paper contains a list of benefits and disadvantages of periconceptional care). 59Citation de Jong-Potjer LC, de Bock GH, Zaadstra BM, de Jong OR, Verloove-Vanhorick SP & Springer MP (2003): Women's interest in GP -initiated pre-conception counselling in The Netherlands.

PCA was offered to women aged 18 -40. The focus was on couples. The exclusion criteria were: already pregnant at the time of inclusion; surgery that resulted in infertility (woman or her partner); infertility treatment; an explicitly completed family; mental incompetence; and insufficient understanding of the Dutch language . Furthermore, GPs could exclude women if social circumstances made the offer of PCA ina ppropriate (e.g. divorce). Participants were a higher socio-economic class than the norm for the population, and the centre had a lower proportion of immigrants than the norm. Objectives of Study The aim of this study was to determine the in terest of women aged 18-40 in pre-conception counselling if this is offered to them by their own GP. Methods A cohort of women (n = 1206) received a persona l letter from their own GP with an offer of pre-conception counselling. The women were requested to fill in a reply form, indicating if they were interested, might be interested (if they decided to become pregnant) or were not interested in an invitation for pre-conception co unselling. When interested, they were asked to give an indication as to when they were planning a pregnancy. Women who were not interested were requested to give a reason. Results Almost 70% of the women returned the reply form . Up to the age of 29 years, at least 80% of the respondents were interested or might be inte rested should they decide to have children. Most women, especially the younger women, do not know exactly when they wish to become pregnant. Regardless of age, >70% of the r espondents were interested. Only 11% of the respondents indicated specifically that they were not interested in advice.

Only Belgium meets the inclusion criteria for the current review, and the findings relevant to this are shown here. Belgium: Baby steps The O.N.E (\"Office de la Naissance et de l'Enfance\" = \"Organization for Birth and Childhood\"), is a Belgian gove rnmental organization charged with the protection and promotion of health of women and children. Given the low fertility rates and high rates of birth defects (2 to 3%of all live births) in Belgium, O.N.E launched a plan to assess the feasibility of implementation of precon ception care in the French speaking part of Belgium, the region with a population of 5 m illion people and about 50,000 births per year. This activity will be implemented through prenatal care, pediatric and gynecology clinics, as well as general practitioners, in partnership with genetic and c ounselling centers. An ad-hoc committee was formed to propose strategies, activities, financing options, and evaluation methods, starting with the development of evidence-based guidelines based on Belgian epidemiological data. The Committee proposed that the guidelines would be in accordance with the recommendations of the Advisory Co mmittee of Bioethics of Belgium concerning genetic tests. The Committee proposed also to organize a campaign targeting both the general public and health care providers to help mark et preconception care in primary care settings. The proposed guidelines include various serologic tests, screening of endocrine or genetic diseases, and preventive services including prom otion of folic acid supplementation. The O.N.E. developed a sustainable campaign plan to inform and sensitize the population about the benefits of preconception care, directing their efforts to individuals aged 15 to 45 years, health professionals including general practitioners , gynaecologists, paediatricians, midwives and all medical social workers, members of th e family planning centres, and school health promotion centers. The first step in the soci al marketing campaign was the creation of the tools including folders, posters, and letters to professionals. These materials were reviewed by the adhoc committee and field tested among a selected group of social workers and the public. The second step will be an information campaign among men and women of reproductive age using posters, folders, and ra dio and television advertisements. Medical and social workers will also receive folder s and posters for distribution to the target population and a letter to inform them about the purpose and methodology of the campaign. Medical practitioners will then receive the guide lines to help them with information to be shared with patients and the laboratory examinati ons to be conducted. The final step will be the evaluation process to assess behavioral ch anges both within the community and at provider level.

BMC Fam Pract 7, 41 Study Design Cross sectional survey Geographical Scope Netherlands ( where about 80% pregnancies are planned) Study Population In each practice, all women aged 18-40 year s were selected. The focus was on couples, planning a pregnancy within a year. GPs revi ewed the selected women and excluded them for the following reasons: completed family, ut erus extirpation, ster ilisation, insufficient knowledge of the Dutch language, subfertility or infertility, pregnancy, definitive social circumstances (such as mental retardation), temporary social circumstances (such as a recent divorce), and \"other\" (such as no longer being registered at the practice or not being thought to be sexually active). Objectives of Study To investigate the extent to which women c ontemplating pregnancy can be reached when a PCC programme is routinely offe red by general practitioners Methods 30 GPs actively offered PCC to all women aged 18 to 40 over a three-year period. GPs reviewed lists of these women and excluded wo men with adverse social circumstances. The remaining women received an invitation for P CC. They were requested to indicate whether they were interested in PCC, and if so, when they were contemplating pregnancy. Those both interested and contemplating pregnancy with in one year were invited for PCC. All pregnancies occurring within one year of an invitation were monitored. Response rates and percentages of pregnancies preceded by an i nvitation or actual attendance to PCC were calculated. Results Overall, 72-75% of the interested responders, who returned the risk-assessment questionnaire (80%), actually attended PCC. However, the GP s excluded a large number of women. In 2002 27% of all pregnancies occurred in the group of women who had been interested and had indicated that they hoped to get pregnant w ithin one year. Another 33% of the pregnancies occurred in the group of women who had been excluded, 13% in the group who had not responded, and 14% in the group who had not been interested Any information on theoretical models No Authors conclusions Only a quarter of the women who became pregna nt in the year after the invitation were reached in time. In order to increase this num ber, methods should be developed to decrease the exclusion of women by the GP s and to increase womens response. 63Citation Frey KA & Files JA (2006): Preconception H ealthcare: What Women Know and Believe.

Study Design Cross sectional survey Geographical Scope USA Study Population Women attending for annual 'well woman' check up Objectives of Study The objectives of this study were to determine if women realize the importance of optimizing their health prior to a pregnancy, whether the pregnancy is planned or not; and to evaluate their knowledge level and beliefs about precon ception healthcare. Additionally, the study sought to understand how and wh en women wanted to receive information on preconception health Methods A survey study was performed using consecutiv e patients presenting to primary care practices for an annual well-woman exam. Patients were recruited based on appointment type and willingness to complete the survey at the time of their appointment, but prior to being seen by the physician Results A total of 499 women completed the survey . Nearly all women (98.6%) realized the importance of optimizing their health prior to a pregnancy, and realized the best time to receive information about preconception health is before conception. 70% of the women were not attempting to conceive at the time of the su rvey. The vast majority of patients surveyed (95.3%) preferred to receive information about preconception health from their primary care physician. Only 39% of women could recall th eir physician ever discussing this topic. The population studied revealed some significant knowledge deficiencies about factors that may threaten the health of mother or fetus.Over 95% were aware of risks associated with drug use, alcohol, tobacco, medication and abuse. 79.6% we re aware of the advice to take folic acid supplements. Any information on theoretical models No Authors conclusions A majority of women do understand the importa nce of optimizing their health prior to conception, and look to their Primary care ph ysician as their preferred source for such information. Study participants demonstrated deficiencies in their knowledge of risk factors that impact maternal and fetal health s uggesting that physicians are not addressing preconception healthcare during routine care. 64Citation Heyes T, Long S & Mathers N (2004): Preconception care: practice and beliefs of primary care workers.

Objectives of Study The aims of the study were to describe the cu rrent practice of PCC in Barnsley and to assess the beliefs and attitudes of primary health car e practitioners. This in formation would help direct appropriate educational and clinical governance intervention to this service in the locality in the light of other evidence about the effectiveness of PCC Methods A questionnaire was devised to explore the belie fs about, and practice in providing, PCC in primary care in the Barnsley Health Authority area and sent to all known GPs, practice nurses (PNs), health visitors (HVs) and midwives ( MWs) in practices in the area in July 2000. A total of 163 completed questi onnaires were received (one re minder, response rate 60.1%). Results Few practices had a written policy on PCC. Most respondents were providing it mainly on an opportunistic basis and had done so less than fi ve times in the previous 3 months; GPs and PNs were most commonly involved. They agreed that advice about smoking ( rated as very important by 96% of the group), drug use (79%) , genetic counselling (71%), disease, alcohol, and maternity care and screening for rubella, genital infections, hepatitis, human immunodeficiency vi rus and cervical cytology were important. They felt that advice about diet (29%), exercise, supplements, food safety, occupational hazards and State benefits, and screening for nut ritional status were less important. Although respondents felt that PCC was effective, and im portant to women of childbearing age, it was not a high priority in their workload. They indicated that this care was best provided in general practice and that they had the appropr iate skills. Barriers to providing PCC included lack of resources and lack of contact with wo men planning to conceive. Few had received any training on PCC since qualifying in their discipline Any information on theoretical models No Authors conclusions The practitioners who responded to this survey ag reed to a large extent about the importance of the subject, and about the content and effec tiveness of PCC. Factors hindering the delivery of this service include resource constraints, lack of training and practice policies and procedures, and difficulty in targeting coupl es planning conception. Further research is needed into ways to increase the provision and uptake of PCC. 65Citation Jack BW, Culpepper L, Babcock J, Kogan MD & Weismiller D (1998): Addressing preconception risks identified at the time of a negative pregnancy test.

Study Design Randomised Controlled Trial Geographical Scope USA Study Population A sample of 170 women presenting between March 9, 1993 and May 31, 1995, for a pregnancy test for which the results were negative Objectives of Study To determine whether comprehensive preconcepti on risk assessment at the time of a negative pregnancy test followed by referral to primary care services is effective in initiating treatment for women with preconception risk factors. Methods One hundred seventy women were offered preconception risk assessment following a negative pregnancy test. Women were assigned randomly either to a usual care group or an intervention group. Women in the latter group we re informed about the risks identified and received an appointment with a primary care c linician who was also informed. Women in the usual care group and their clinicians received no feedback. All charts were reviewed and the women were contacted by telephone to determine if interventions to reduce risk were offered by clinicians during the year following the assessment.Risk categories were created by grouping clinically similar variables from the PRS and then combining them into six major groups: medical, infectious, fetal exposure, psyc hosocial, nutrition, family planning, and all risks combined Results An average of 8.96 risks were identified per woman. The proportion of women having risks in each of 12 risk categories studied ranged from 19% to 71%. One hundred women (59%) made at least one visit during the subsequent year, thus allowing the opportunity for preconception care. The proportion of these women who had a risk addressed ranged from 18% for psychosocial risks to 48% for those w ith fetal exposures (smoking, alcohol, and drug use). There was no difference between groups in the percentage of risks addressed. Any information on theoretical models No Authors conclusions The notification of women and their clinicia ns of identified preconception risks did not improve intervention rates. A more organized intervention system including office-based protocols is needed. Future research must dem onstrate ways to motivate both clinicians and women to address preconception risks. Further development of office-based protocols that promote follow-up and the use of protocols for behavioral or psychosocial conditions may be particularly helpful. It then remains for futu re research to show that initiating interventions leads to lower risk status, and that these ac tions ultimately lead to improved perinatal outcomes. of a preconceptional health promotion program on inte ndedness of pregnancy.

Each of the departments offers a standardized preconceptional health promotion program in its family planning clinics. Co mparisons were undertaken for 456 women who had been exposed to the family planning preconception program, 309 women who had attended the family planning clinics but had not been exposed to the program, and 613 women who were unknown to the health depart ment before beginning prenatal care. Results Women exposed to information on preconceptiona l health during routine family planning visits, the experimental group, had a 51.8% (p = 0.064) greater likelihood of identifying their pregnancies at intended than a group known to the local health departments' family planning programs but unexposed to the intervention. Fu rthermore, the experimental group had a 64.2% (p = 0.0009) greater likelihood of inte ndedness than a comparison group not known to the health departments before the initiation of prenatal care. Any information on theoretical models No Authors conclusions The study indicates that an introductory program of preconceptional health promotion which is targeted to women not planning a pregnancy in the immediate future is associated with a higher rate of intendedness in s ubsequent pregnancies. Expans ion of similar preconceptional programs in family planning clinics may prove a useful approach for promoting intendedness of pregnancy in low-income women. 67Citation Poppelaars FA, Cornel MC & Ten Kate LP (2004) : Current practice and future interest of GPs and prospective parents in pre-concepti on care in The Netherlands. Fam Pract 21, 307- 309 Study Design Cross sectional survey Geographical Scope Netherlands ( where about 80% pregnancies are planned) Study Population GPs and recently married couples. GPs (n = 200) were randomly selected by the Netherlands Institute of Primary Care Research (NIVEL). Six municipalities were asked to select the addresses of 50 recently married couples, in wh ich the woman was under 36 years of age. One municipality selected 53 couples, resulting in a total of 303 couples. Objectives of Study To investigate current pre-conception care activities of GPs and to determine whether prospective parents would visit the GP in the existing health care system. A further aim was to determine the interest of GPs and prospectiv e parents in the introduction of pre-conception care clinics. Methods Questionnaire survey. Results Of the eligible GPs, 52% (n = 102) participated, as did 70% (n = 381) of the eligible individuals who are planning a pregnancy.With re gard to the statement: \"I will visit my GP before I am pregnant to get information about risk factors and test possibilities before and during pregnancy\", 22% of the individuals pla nning a pregnancy answered that they (fully) agreed, 60% (fully) disagreed and 18% were uns ure. No differences in socio-demographic variables were found between individuals with a positive intention and individuals with a negative/neutral intention to visit the GP. If a pre-conception care clinic did exist, 60% of the individuals planning a pregnancy stated that they would visit such a clinic, 12% would not and 28% were unsure. Of the individuals w ith a positive intention to visit future pre- conception care clinics, 34% stated that they woul d also visit their GP pre-conceptionally Of the GPs, 63% were in favour of the introduc tion of pre-conception care clinics, 18% were against and 19% remained neutral Any information on theoretical models No Authors conclusions Since most GPs and prospective parents favoured the introduction of pre-conception care, future research should focus on the most appropria te way of implementation. The interest of the target population in pre-conception care was also found to be high (70%) in another Dutch survey, but low (10-40%) in a UK survey ( Wa llace 1998 - not included in current review) and in a Hungarian centre where pre-conception care was actually offered. Caution must be exercised in equating positive intention to actua l participation. Before implementation, it will be necessary to determine who should provide the pre-conception care. In this study, only half of the GPs who favoured the introduction of pre-conception care were convinced that GPs should provide this care, unlike an earlier surv ey in The Netherlands, in which 93% of the GPs considered preconception care part of their job. It also seems feasible to train practice nurses to provide pre-conception counselling. Other possible providers of pre-conception care are midwives and gynaecologists. Furtherm ore, promotion of pre-conception health could be managed by school education progra mmes, mass media campaigns and information websites. Finally, for countries with a high percentage of unplanned pregnancies, pre- conception care could be offered opportunis tically to people of reproductive age by physicians in obstetrics and gynaecology, intern al medicine and family medicine, for example during annual visits, family planni ng visits or infertility visits. 68Citation Public Health Agency of Canada (2000) Fa mily-Centred Maternity and Newborn Care: National Guidelines.

Study Design Expert Committee Geographical Scope Canada Study Population NA Objectives of Study To promote the health of women, men, and families before pregnancy Methods The Guidelines are the result of a three-phase process, starting with a survey of users; proceeding with consultation w ith national professional and consumer organizations; and concluding with the writing and review by individuals representing the various disciplines involved in maternal and newborn care, families and all regions of the country Results The document is long, and the following is a summary of the more relevant points: 1) It is recommended that women and men from diverse backgrounds be involved in all aspects of preconception care, including determining prioriti es, developing and delivering programs, and participating on institutional/age ncy committees. Such participation will ensure that the care provided responds to community needs. 2) Health care providers also need accurate and up-to-date information on preconception health issues. They require ongoing education through conferences, journals, and courses. They need to be informed about the most recent research evidence and its application. They shoul d be familiar with \"best practice\" models for providing preconception care 3) Precon ception care and programs should be offered through a number of venues, in various community locales, and through a variety of creative approaches. It is recommended that preconcepti on care and education be incorporated into school curricula and the workplace, delivered through the media, and offered through community-based agencies. A variety of mechanis ms can be used to share information. These include the Internet, audiovisual resources, print resources, as well as group and individual sessions. 4) Preconception Assessment, Counselling, and Support: Specific Issues a) The preconception period is a time to identif y women and families with inadequate support and to try to link them up with appropriate community resources. b) The goal of preconceptual counselling is to provide the wo man and her partner with accurate information about their health with regard to reproduction, pr egnancy, and any potential risks. It is then up to them to make an informed choice.

Matern Child Health J 4, 183-189 Study Design Qualitative (open ended semi structured interviews) Geographical Scope USA Study Population 27 pregnant women seeking prenatal care or abortion Objectives of Study To explore how women conceptualize the intentio n status of their pregnancies and how their concepts relate to the classification scheme used by the National Survey of Family Growth. Methods This qualitative study used in-depth, semistructu red, open-ended intervie ws with 27 pregnant women seeking prenatal care or abortion. Sampling was based on ethnicity (Caucasian or Hispanic), education, religiosity, and NSFG intention status (intended, mistimed, or unwanted). Results Five qualitative dimensions of pregnancy intendedness emerge d: preconception desire for pregnancy, steps taken to prepare for pregna ncy, fertility behavior and expectations, postconception desire for pregnancy, and adapta tion to pregnancy and baby. The relationship of these qualitative dimensions to the NSFG cate gories was varied and complex, particularly for the NSFG mistimed category. Women indicated that their partners had a strong influence on preconception and postconception desire for pregnancy. Any information on theoretical models No Authors conclusions Further research is needed to develop measur es of pregnancy intendedness that accurately reflect the needs and priorities of women. The results point to the centrality of the women's perceptions of her significant relationships, par ticularly her relationship with her partner, as playing a key role in at least some dimensi ons of pregnancy intendedness.Research that addresses male perspectives and influence is of particular importance. 70Citation van Heesch PN, de Weerd views on preconception care. Midwifery 22, 120-124 Study Design Cross sectional survey Geographical Scope Netherlands ( where about 80% pregnancies are planned) Study Population Community midwives (n = 129) working in 49 midwifery practices that refer their high-risk clients to the Erasmus University Medical Centre, Rotterdam Objectives of Study To explore the opinions of midwives on the d esirability of preconception care for all couples contemplating pregnancy, their willingness to introduce preconception care to midwifery practice and, if it were to be implemented, the necessary conditions, including knowledge, postgraduate education and referral possib ilities for successful implementation in the community Methods Midwives working at the midwifery practices we re recruited by telephone. All agreed to participate, and subsequently received a questionnaire by post Results 102 (79%) questionnaires were returned. Nine ty-five (93%) of the 102 midwives were familiar with the concept of preconception care, and 71 (70%) of them already provided it to some extent. Of the 102 respondents, 84 (83%) see med to be willing to provide such care in the future, and 56 (55%) felt that preconception care should be part of their professional domain. Midwives, however, lack time and knowledge to do so. Any information on theoretical models No Authors conclusions Community midwives already provide counselling, although not on a structural basis, and usually not earlier than in the first trimester of pregnancy. Midwives seem willing to play an active role in the provision of preconception car e in the future. There is, however, great need for postgraduate training. 71 APPENDIX 3b: Review 2 papers for which abstracts were downloaded, but which were ex cluded from the study (n =83), with reasons for exclusion .

Each month, PRAMS selects a stratified, systematic sample of 100--250 women who have recently given birth in a particular area from the birth certificates of the infants, and a survey questionnaire is mailed to the selected mothers approximately 2-6 months after delivery. The current study used multiple years of data (1995--1998) from 13 states (n=58,625 births). Results During the study period, overall folic acid awareness increased 15%, from 64% in 1996 to 73% in 1998, although changes varied by state. Despite this increase, differences in folic acid awareness were observed among different gro ups of women. Women who obtained a high school education or less; who were black, Hi spanic, or from other racial/ethnic groups; who entered prenatal care after the first trimester; and whose pregnancies were unintended were less aware of folic acid. This study indicat es that gaps persist among women in low socioeconomic groups. Any information on theoretical models used No Authors conclusions Overall, the data indicated an increase in folic acid awareness among women with recent deliveries. However, this awareness might be too late for the pregna ncy that has occurred, indicating a continued need to educate all re productive-aged women regarding the need to take folic acid before they become pregnant. 78Citation Allen T, Thomson WM, Emmerton LM & Poulton R (2000): Nutritional supplement use among 26-year-olds.

However, folic acid awareness decreased for women with no high school education from 1997 to 1999 ( P = .05). In addition, folic acid awareness wa s lower among black women (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 0.43; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.4, 0. 5, versus other races), women with unplanned pregnancies (adjusted OR 0.6; 95% CI 0.5, 0.8, versus those with planned pregnancies), and those with no high school education (adjusted OR 0.08; 95% CI 0.03, 0.2, versus women with college education) Any information on theoretical models used No Authors conclusions Although folic acid awareness has increased among Michigan mothers overall during 1996- 1999, it has decreased among women with less th an a high school education, and substantial gaps exist among socioeconomic subgroups.

However, the use of folic acid was not significantly different between non-western and western women (56% versus 69%) if they had been aware of the recomme ndation to use folic acid before pregnancy. Awareness of the recommendation to use folic acid was higher in older women (OR: 1.46; 95% CI: 1.13-1.89), women of western descent (0 .27; 0.16-0.47), women with a higher level of education (0.35; 0.27-0.45) and in case of pl anned pregnancy (0.45; 0.31-0.67). The use of folic acid, restricted to women who were aw are of the recommendation to use folic acid before their pregnancy, was higher in older wo men (1.37; 1.05-1.80) and lower in those with more previous pregnancies (0.57; 0.43-0.75) and in case of an unplanned pregnancy (0.55; 0.34-0.88) Any information on theoretical models used No Authors conclusions Although non-western women had less knowledge of the recommendation to use folic acid than western women, the use of folic acid was not significantly different from that by western women if they had been aware of the recomme ndation to use folic acid before pregnancy. 81Citation Blake M, Herrick K & Kelly Y (2003) Health Survey for England 2002:Maternal and Infant Health.

Over ha lf of these mothers (55%) reported taking supplements or changing their diet prior to pr egnancy to increase folate intake ( Note: since only about half of pregnancies in the UK are planned, and therefore this figure suggests that less than about 25% of women take folic acid before pregnancy). n The proportion increasing their folate intake increased with age from 32% of those aged 16-24 to 59% of those aged 25- 34 and 60% of those aged 35 and over n65% of mothers in managerial and professional households took folate compared with 43% in routine and semi-routine households. nThe percentage of mothers increasing their folate intake before pregnancy decreased as area deprivation levels increased, from 70% of mother s in the least deprived areas to 43% in the most deprived areas. nAs household income increa sed, so did the percentage of mothers who increased their folate intake before pregnancy, from 25% in the lowest income quintile, to 46% in the second lowest quintile, 65% in th e middle and second highest income quintiles, and 69% in the highest income quintilenFamily stru cture was related to mothers' folate intake, with a quarter (25%) of lone mothers incr easing their folate intake before pregnancy compared with 58% of mothers in two parent householdsnThe most common form of folate supplementation was through tablets which we re taken by 65% of mothers who reported increasing their folate intake. 5% of mothers who reported they had increased their folate intake changed their diet before pregnanc y and the remaining 30% reported both taking tablets and changing their diet.

The response rate was 52%. Results KNOWLEDGE :Overall, 68% of women reported ha ving ever heard of or having ever read about folic acid, a 31% increase from 52% in 1995. Awareness of folic acid was lowest among women aged 18-24 years (50%) and women who had less than a high school education (40%). Of all women surveyed, 13% knew that folic acid helps prevent birth defects, and 7% knew that folic acid should be taken before pregnancy compared with 5% and 2%, respectively, in 1995. UPTAKE: In 1998, 32% of women reported taking a vitamin supplement containing folic acid on a daily basis, compared with 28% in 1995. Among women who reported being not pregnant at th e time of the survey, 29% reported taking a vitamin supplement containing folic acid, compared with 25% in 1995. The proportion of all women who took a vitamin containing folic acid l ess frequently than daily remained at 11%. Those who continued to be the most likely to take vitamin supplements containing folic acid on a daily basis include women aged 25-45 years (34%), college graduates (40%), and those with high incomes (e.g., 38% among women whose annual household income is greater than or equal to $50,000). SOURCES OF INFORMATION: From 1995 to 1998, the proportion of women who reported obtaining information about folic acid from magazine or newspaper articles decreased from 35% to 31%. However, the proportions that reported learning about folic acid from radio or television and health- care providers increased from 10% to 23% and from 13% to 19%, respectively Any information on theoretical models used No Authors conclusions The findings indicate that about 70% of women know folic acid should be taken before pregnancy to reduce the risk for neural tube defects. 88Citation Centres for Disease Control (2004): Use of vitamins containing folic acid among women of childbearing age--United States, 2004.

In 1998, 2613 persons were interviewed in Michigan. Analysis was restricted to 739 women of reproductive age (aged 18--44 years). Results USE: Overall, 42.4% of wome n reported taking a multivitamin or folic acid supplement daily. Multivitamin use increased with age, from 33.1% for women aged 18--24 years to 48.1% for women aged 40--44 years. The prevalence of women who used a multivitamin was highest among those who were consumers of five or more fruits and vegetables a day (54.9%), college educated (49.9%), aged 35--39 years (49.6%), former smokers (47.4%), married (46.0%), not overweight (44.5%), and white (44.2%). After multivariable analysis, the following groups were statistically significantly less likely than their respective comparison group to use a multivitamin daily: women aged 18--24 years, women who had a low level of education, women who ate less than five fru its and vegetables a day, and obese women. KNOWLEDGE: Overall, 30.0% of women had knowledge of folic acid use, defined as responding that the prevention of birth defects is the reason to take folic acid. The prevalence of women with folic acid knowledge was high est among women who were college graduates (42.2%), aged 25--29 years (39.8%), former smokers (37.0%), married (35.8%), ate five or more fruits and vegetables a day (34.9%), not overweight (31.9%), and white (31.5%). Multivariable analysis indicated that wome n who were high school graduates, current smokers, and unmarried were statistically si gnificantly less likely than their respective comparison group to have correct knowledge of folic acid use. Women aged 18--29 were statistically significantly more likely than thei r respective comparison group to have correct knowledge Any information on theoretical models used no Authors conclusions 91Public health campaigns that promote the cons umption of folic acid should target women who are young, unmarried, obese, smoke, eat few fruits and vegetables, and have a low level of education. 92Citation Centres for Disease Control (1999): Folic acid campaign and Virginia, 1997-1999.

The television and radio PSAs used actors from the local theater and local broadcasting students. Printed materials included brochures, posters, information cards, food labe ls, flyers, banners, and display boards. Focus groups and readability tests were conducted to he lp develop print materials. A local grocery store chain helped promote the use of folate-dense foods, folic acid vitamin supplements, fortified cereals, and multivita min supplements by having volunteers specially label specific foods and hand out educational materials. Vol unteers also distributed green ribbons in the communities to promote folic acid awareness. Local school board members and teachers developed a folic acid teaching packet for use in health education and biology classes for students in grades 5-12 and college-level nursing programs. The campaign activities and results were evaluated using precampaign and postcampaign random sample telephone surveys to assess folic acid awareness and knowledge. The precampaign survey, conducted during January 1997, included 412 women aged 18-45 years chosen by a systematic random sample of listed telephone num bers. The postcampaign tele phone surveys were conducted during January 1998 (n=419) and February 1999 (n=278), using identical survey methods and an additional question about the source of folic acid information. Results Based on responses to the question \"Have you h eard about the benefits of folic acid?\", reported awareness increased significantly, from 31% in 1997 (precampaign) to 54% in 1998 (postcampaign), and to 75% in 1999 (sustainability survey) (p less than 0.05, chi-square test).Among women who reported hearing about th e benefits of folic acid, the proportion who correctly answered that one benefit of folic acid was to help prevent certain birth defects increased from 77% in 1997 to 81% in 1998 and to 88% in 1999. Among women who reported in the postcampaign survey that they had heard about folic acid, knowledge about ways to increase consumption increased from 55% in 1997 to 73% in 1999, but correct knowledge about the best time to take folic acid (before or during pregnancy) did not increase. Women who had heard of folic acid cite d television and health-care providers as the two leading sources of information. 93Any information on theoretical models used No Authors conclusions The findings from precampaign and postcampaign surveys, showed a significant increase in reported awareness and knowledge of the benefits of folic acid and re ported knowledge about the sources of folic acid. 94Citation Chacko MR, Anding R, Kozinetz CA, Grover JL & Smith PB (2003): Neural tube defects: knowledge and preconceptional prevention prac tices in minority young women.

The program was implemented at the sites in sequence by a trained health educator who first spent 6 months at the hospital-based clinic, followed by 5 months at a community-based clinic and 4 months at another community-based clinic. Afte r clinic registration, the women were asked to complete an assessment questionnaire. When a young woman indicated interest in taking a daily multivitamin, a 3-month supply of multivita min tablets was given to her by the nurse. The follow-up survey was conducted by first randomly selecting (using a random-numbers table) approximately 25% of young wo men of all racial/ethnic groups Results Of 387 women , 72% were black and 28% were Hi spanic. At enrollment, clinics were a major source of information of NTD prevention (44%); 52% had heard of folic acid, 45% had heard of NTDs, and 50% had heard of birth defects prevention by multivitamins. Significantly more Hispanic than black young women had heard of NTDs (59% vs 39%). Pregnancy history, regular birth control use, and education leve l for age were independently associated with knowledge. In young women with low education level for age, regular birth control use was significantly associated with knowledge. At en rollment, daily multivitamin intake was very low (9%) and folate-rich foods were consumed in inadequate amounts. Adequate folate diet was not associated with knowledge. The program follow-up survey indicated that 88% to 92% had knowledge of NTDs and folic acid, and 67% reported taking a daily multivitamin. Any information on theoretical models used No Authors conclusions Publicly funded clinics may be the only source of information on NTD prevention for many minority young women. Preliminary evidence suggests that a promotion program improves 95knowledge, and dispensing of multivitamins increas es multivitamin use. However, clinicians in such programs need to reinforce daily adherence to multivitamins in young women. 96Citation Chan A, Pickering J, Haan E, Netting M, Burford A, Johnson A & Keane RJ (2001): \"Folate before pregnancy\": the impact on women and health professionals of a population-based health promotion campaign in South Australia.

Evaluation was by computer-assisted telephone interviews undertaken by random dialling throughout the St ate before and after the campaign, and by self-administered questionnaires to health prof essionals and women in the postnatal period. Results Significant increases in knowledge about folate followed the campaign. Health professionals and women in the postnatal period had higher in itial levels of knowledge about folate, which also increased significantly. The proportions of women taking periconceptional folic acid supplements, and of health professionals advisi ng women planning a pr egnancy about folate, also increased significantly, and folic acid tablet sales doubled. Total prevalence of neural tube defects declined between 1966 and 1999 from a baseline of 2.0 per 1,000 births to 1.1 per 1,000 births (Poisson regression, P= 0. 03; average decline of 1.0% per year). Any information on theoretical models used No Authors conclusions A short educational campaign with a limite d budget ($40,000) can promote folate successfully, but alternative strategies such as food fortification are likely to be needed to achieve adequate periconceptional folate inta ke for a very high proportion of women. 97Citation Cleves MA, Hobbs CA, Collins HB, Andrews N, Smith LN & Robbins JM (2004): Folic acid use by women receiving routine gynecologic care.

One thousand women were interviewed during the immediate postpartum period about their knowledge of neural tube defects and folic acid intake before and during pregnancy Results Most women (85.7%) referred not having been specifically informed about the need to take folic acid to prevent neural tube defects alt hough approximately half of the women (50.6%) were in fact, aware of the need for folic acid intake. Eight percent (8.1%) of the women took folic acid before conception but only 6.9% di d so during the effective period from 4 weeks before conception to 4 weeks after conception. Logistic regression analysis showed that awareness of the need to take folic acid toge ther with having had preconceptional counselling and knowledge of NTDs were the strongest variab les related to the fact of having taken folic acid during the correct period. Any information on theoretical models used No Authors conclusions Although the population is aware of the need to ta ke folic acid, the real impact of the present recommendations is almost negligible. Info rmation in primary care and preconceptional counselling to specifically inform patients about the need to take folic acid to prevent NTDs seem to be crucial to improve the final inta ke of folic acid during the protective period. 99Citation Daltveit AK, Vollset SE, Lande B & Oien H ( 2004): Changes in knowledge and attitudes of folate, and use of dietary supplements among women of reproductive age in Norway 1998- 2000.

Only 4.0% and 8.5% of the women, respectively, knew that the critical period for folic acid supplement to reduce th e risk of neural tube defect is before and early in pregnancy. Knowledge and increase in knowledge between the two surveys were highest among women close to pregnancy (woman planning pregnancy, pregnant women, or women who had given birth within the l ast 12 months), and among women with high education. Among the 54 women in 1998 and the 55 women in 2000 whose last birth was within the previous year, use of a folic acid supplement before or early in the last pregnancy was reported by 10% (95% confidence interval (CI) 5-21%) and by 47% (95% CI 35-60%), respectively. Among women close to pregnancy, 76% in 1998 and 87% in 2000 stated that they would use a folic acid supplement in a future pregnancy. Any information on theoretical models used No Authors conclusions Knowledge and use of folate among Norwegia n women increased from 1998 to 2000.

Effectiveness and potentia l savings were based on hospital costs of neural tube defects, low birth weight, very low birth weight and perinatal death attributable to maternal smoking. Results Total costs were estimated at 5.1 million dollars and 7.2 million dollars, at uptake rates of 50% and 75%, respectively. If 50% of wome n would seek preconception counseling, 22 neural tube defects, 98 low-birth-weight in fants, 10 very-low-birth-weight infants and 7 perinatal deaths could be avoided. At 75% upt ake, 33 neural tube defects, 146 low- and 15 very-low-birth-weight infants, and 11 perinatal deaths could be avoided. Any information on theoretical models used No Authors conclusions Net costs of preconception counseling amount to 3.7 million dollars and 5 million dollars when considering cases prevented and subsequent potential savings in costs of neural tube defects and smoking-related morbidity only. Howe ver, in light of many other preventable adverse outcomes and the potential of preconcep tion counseling to prevent significant lifetime costs for affected children, th e net costs may ultimately result in a favorable cost-savings balance. Moreover, the importance of a healt hy child cannot be expressed in terms of costs and savings alone. 106Citation DiPietro NA & Kier KL (2001): An educational intervention about folic acid and healthy pregnancies targeted at college-age wome n.

The professions targeted were those who were more likely to come into contact w ith women of child-bearing age, e.g. midwives, health visitors, practice nurses and family pla nning staff. Altogether 24 1-h training sessions were held reaching 189 staff. Each session consis ted of factual information, a brainstorming session about what pregnant women eat and a nutrition game involving calculating a day's intake of folic acid. Questionnaires were used to evaluate the level of knowledge before and after training. Feedback about the sessions was also obtained from participants Results With every group trained there was an improve ment in knowledge. The greatest change was that staff realized how difficult it is to consume the recommended amount of folic acid from food alone. Before the training session 42% of the health professionals thought that women could eat enough folic acid and after the training this had fallen to just 1% ( no statistical analysis). Practice Nurses were the group who reported being asked most frequently about folic acid (82%), compared with gps ( 55%) and dietititans (13%).

Results Before the intervention, 3.8% of the women implemented folic-acid-prophylaxis compared with 9.3% afterwards (p = n.s.). The awar eness of the prophylaxis before pregnancy correlated with socio-economic status and rose from 28% (before) to 42% after intervention (p < 0.05).

Results OVERVIEW: By January 2005, eleven of the eighteen countries contributing to this report had introduced an official policy advising women to take periconceptional folic acid supplementation. The first governments to formul ate such a policy were in the Netherlands (1992), UK (1992) and Ireland (1993). Of the other 7 countries: Portugal recommends that health workers should educate women about the benefits of folic acid; Malta and Finland recommend raising folate status by dietary mean s only; and four countries (Austria, Belgium, Croatia, Germany) have no official government policy at the time of writing, although professional groups within them advise supplem entation. Half the countries have launched some type of health education campaign so that the information about the protective effect of folic acid can reach women directly rather than uniquely through health professionals. In all countries, only a minority of women were found to have taken folic acid supplements during the entire advised periconceptional period. The highest uptake was recorded in Netherlands, UK, Ireland and Norway with 30-46% periconceptional uptake. Extremely low uptakes of less than 5% were found in France, Spain, Germ any and Italy. It should be noted that the countries in which the highest uptake rates were found were those with official health education initiatives. The low uptake of peri conceptional folic acid supplements may be because a large proportion of women do not plan their pregnancies. The report presents information on the estimated number of planned pregnancies in different countries, and this ranges from 10-20% in Poland, to 75% in Croatia. COUNTRY SPECIFIC INFORMATION:The report contains detailed info rmation for each country, and in Table 2 ( p 24) of the main report, provided a summary of the status ( official/unofficial) of supplementation policy; whether there is a hea lth education campaign and the dates of this.

Results 1) RECOMMENDATIONS: Government should fi nance a clear, consistent and innovative health campaign. The key message should be that folic acid can help to prevent up to 50% of NTD cases provided it is taken three months pr e-conceptually and through the first 12 weeks of pregnancy. Key healthcare professional groups should routinely discuss and recommend folic acid supplementation to all women w ho are ovulating and sexually active. These include, General Practitioners, Gynaecologists, Ob stetricians, Health Visitors, Pharmacists, Practice Nurses, School Nurses, and Sexual Hea lth and Family Planning Doctors, Nurses and Midwives. Healthcare professional organisa tions should be involved in the continuing education of their respective members. Prim ary healthcare professionals should ensure an immediate consultation for any pregnant woman that already has an NTD baby or genetic predisposition, or provide deta iled advice including a prescription for 0.5mg folic acid. Manufacturers of sanitary products, pregnancy and ovulation testing kits, baby formula, and foods fortified with folic acid should include info rmation on their packaging. Department of Health should develop Primary Care Trust (PCT) targets for increasing folic acid supplementation and uptake. In summary, there is a need for greater collaboration between healthcare professionals, third parties, government al organisations and industry to develop an ongoing and hard-hitting health promotion strategy, and to ensure that all women in the at- risk group have access to such messages and to affordable folic acid supplementation. 2) SURVEY FINDINGS: Overall, 67 per cent of the sample that took folic acid claimed that they did so due to GP recommendation (see table 1). Overall, nine out of ten women taking folic acid were aware of the health benefits (see table 2). Overall, usage of folic acid amongst mothers was greatest in the 25-34 age band with 64 per cent, which was significantly higher than 16-24 and 35-45 age bands who score d 42 per cent and 53 per cent respectively. Overall, 53 per cent of women planning a pr egnancy and during pre gnancy took folic acid (see table 3). Overall, only 28 per cent took folic acid when planning their pregnancy (see table 4). One in ten women claimed not to k now the benefits of taking folic acid (see table 1135). Women were four times more likely to get advice on taking folic acid from a GP than a midwife and nine times more likely than family/friends (see table 6). Of the women who had a child in the last five years, 52 per cent were asked to attend a health check immediately (see table 7), of these only 43 per cent were working mums compared to 62 per cent of non- working mums. Any information on theoretical models used No Authors conclusions Folic Acid Action is calling for a focus on folic acid, and plans to use its findings to campaign to raise awareness of and action to resolve th e issues relating to folic acid education and provision. 114Citation Food Safety Authority of Ireland (2006) Repor t of the National Committee of Folic Acid Food Fortification, Dublin Full text (F) or Abstract (A) used for data extraction F Study design Expert Report Country Ireland Study population NA Any information specifically relevant to Low Income (LI) or ethnic (As=Asian; Ac=Afrocaribbean; AA=African American; O=Other) women No Which study popn best describes the sample into 1) women of childbearing age 2) women - planning pregnancy 3) pregnant women/new mothers asked retrospectively about pre conception 4) combination of 1-3 4 Objectives of study To review options for the fortification of f oods with folic acid and address the broader aspects of policy implementation, including technical issues on folic acid food fortification, risk assessment and examination of reported health benefits associated with increased levels of folic acid in the diet.

The policy of recommending folic acid supplements to all women of childbearing age who are sexually active and may become pregnant, needs to contin ue, alongside a policy of food fortification in Ireland to provide optimal protection for pregnancies against the risk of NTDs.

In Australia, various education initiatives have been undertaken by a number of jurisdictions to encourage women of child-bearing age to increase their dietary folate and/or take folic acid supplements. Despite these campaigns, current advice for s upplemental folic acid is not followed by a majority of women in the target group. Reasons for this include: a large percentage of pregnancies are unplanned; lack of knowledge among women about the benefits of folic acid; knowledge not always equating to beha viour change; and numerous barriers to supplement usage, such as co st, access and compliance issues. Since 1995 in Australia and 1996 in New Zealand, certain foods have been ab le to be fortified with folic acid. Standard 1.3.2 of the Australia New Zealand Food Standa rds Code (the Code) permits folic acid to be voluntarily added to a maximum claim of 100g pe r reference quantity to a number of cereal- based foods, fruit and vegetables juices and drinks , yeast and meat extracts. Despite this, total folate intakes in women of child-bearing age ha ve not increased significantly and are still well below recommended intakes.

Maintenance of the Status Quo (i.e. voluntary folate permissions for some foods). 2. Increased permis sions for voluntary folate fortification. 3. Mandatory folate fortification. 4. Increased health promotion and education strategies to increase folate intakes. This is a non-regulat ory option and could be selected as the sole strategy to further reduce the incidence of NT Ds or be implemented in conjunction with any of the other three options. 116Citation French MR, Barr SI & Levy-Milne R (2003): Fola te intakes and awareness of folate to prevent neural tube defects: a survey of women living in Vancouver, Canada.

Using an in terviewer-administered survey. Results Supplements contributed 205+/-388 microg SFA/day. Although 86% of women met the Estimated Average Requirement (320 DFE/day) for folate, only 26% met the recommendation (400 microg SFA/day) for women capable of becoming pregnant. Most (95%) of the women had heard of folate, but only 25% knew that it could prevent birth defects. One-fourth of the women had good or very good knowledge of folate-rich foods. However, folate knowledge was not related to its intake. The most common sources of folate information were magazines/newspapers, doctors , and television/radio. Lack of awareness of the importance of folate was the most common reason given for choosing not to use folic acid supplements before pregnancy. However, 78% of the women indicated that, with knowledge of the benefits of folate, they would use suppl emental folic acid daily to reduce the risk of birth defects Any information on theoretical models used No Authors conclusions Educational strategies are required to in crease folate awareness among women and to promote the benefits of periconceptional folic acid supplementation. Targeting physicians to educate women on the importance of folate could be a potentially successful route 117Citation Garcia Carballo MM, Gonzalez Gonzalez AI & Jimenez Garcia R (2003): [Prophylaxis of neural tube defects with folic acid in pregnant women from a health district].

A 34% was able to describe folic acid as an efficacious me thod to diminish the incidence of NTD. The percentage of women who used correctly the prophylaxis was significantly greater when it was prescribed by a family physician (P=.003) Any information on theoretical models used No Authors conclusions A great proportion of women from the health district take folic acid during pregnancy, but just a small percent accomplis hes the treatment correctly. The lack of awareness among women about the need for periconceptional folic acid supplements and how it should be taken following the recommendations to prevent NTD are the main reasons for not accomplishing a correct prophylaxis. Family physicians could play an important role as health educators. 118Citation Gjergja R, Stipoljev F, Hafner T, Tezak N & Luzar-Stiffler V (2006): Knowledge and use of folic acid in Croatian pregnant women--a need for health care education initiative.

Failure to use folic acid w as significantly associated with unplanned pregnancy, increased age and no previous pregnancies. Lack of awareness of the potential benefits associated with folic acid use was the commonest reason cited for not taking it. Increased health education through health car e professionals and mass media campaigns can improve awareness and thereby increase the use of folic acid supplements in planned pregnancies. However, 42% of women in our study had unplanned pregnancies. Any information on theoretical models used No Authors conclusions Intake of folic acid in this group can only be increased by improvements in dietary intake within the population as a whole, and by fortification of commonly ingested foods. 120Citation Goldberg BB, Alvarado S, Chavez C, Chen BH, Dick LM, Felix RJ, Kao KK & Chambers CD (2006): Prevalence of periconceptional fo lic acid use and perceived barriers to the postgestation continuance of supplemental fo lic acid: survey results from a Teratogen Information Service.

Predictors of lack of use included a higher prepregnancy body mass index, younger maternal age, non-white race/ethni city, lower education level, and unplanned pregnancy. One-quarter of the women said they would be willing to continue taking vitamins after the pregnancy if advised to do so by a physician. The remainder identified obstacles to following that advice--notably, not planning to become pregnant again and the belief that enough folate is derived from diet alone. Any information on theoretical models used No Authors conclusions More than half of the callers to the TIS we re not compliant with recommendations regarding periconceptional folic acid supplementation.

After a statew ide educational program, another mail survey was sent to the same groups of providers to determine the effect of the campaign Results Comparison between the two surveys showed a significant increase in knowledge and in the percentage of health care providers who reco mmended the periconceptional use of folic acid for the prevention of neural tube defects. Pr oviders graduating in 1 992 or later were more likely than those graduating before 1992 to ha ve the appropriate knowledge about folic acid use but were less likely to recommend it to their patients. Any information on theoretical models used No Authors conclusions Significant gains were made in increasing know ledge and changing practice behavior among selected Florida health care providers. Regardl ess of the magnitude of these gains, our data show that some health care providers who have regular contact with women of childbearing age still do not know the recommended doses of fo lic acid or do not recommend its use. This points toward the need for continued education as well as efforts to modify provider behavior. 123Citation Health Education Authority (1999) Folic acid r esearch report.

Having babies was accepted as a natural part of being a woman. Awareness of Folic acid was low amongst the target audience, largely due to their lack of thought abou t preconception issues, but awareness increased significantly amongst those who had given birth 2 ) Typical reactions to unintended pregnancies were characterised by shock. This was particularly common amongst teenagers. Those who had already had children expressed concern about the practicalities of having another baby and, and this was particularly true of unsupported mothers. African Caribbean women showed determination to have childre n with or without support and Asian women were much more likely to plan their children w ith the help of their extended families. 3) Mothers and friends were credible sources of advice and tended to supersede professional advice particularly in the early stages of pregnancy. The key time for taking Folic acid - before conception - was a time when most of the women were wholly uninterested in advice. 4) The target audience requires clarity on key pa rts of the Folic acid message particularly the importance of taking it preconception. 5) In te rms of approaches it is key that the folic acid message actively seeks out these vulnerable gr oups. They will not proactively seek out information and they are not comfortabl e with detailed written resources. Direct communication approaches would be appropriate for raising awareness e.g. verbally, posters, videos, television. Short written resources could be used to develop the message e.g. leaflets or postcards. Communications should emphasise Folic acid as a vitamin for all women which will both improve the health of a baby and redu ce the risk of birth defects. Communications should be available in South Asia n languages. 5) Health professionals felt that low levels of awareness and understanding made it hard for them to explain the benefits of Folic acid to 124this group. There was a lack of available oppor tunities to make contact. However, they felt that Folic acid was emerging more in cons ultations, and many were adopting ad hoc approaches acknowledging that Folic acid should be mentioned at every available opportunity during a consultation with the women of child-b earing age. Furthermore GPs claimed to be prescribing folic acid and felt that women gene rally took a supplement if provided with a prescription. Health professionals felt that it was important to raise awareness of Folic acid preconception by using diverse community b ased routes e.g. schools, community centres, family planning centres, pharmacists and television. Well-presented communication was thought to be vital e.g. in pregnancy pack s, on Asian television channels. For health professionals themselves an actionable documen t was suggested, including case studies and tips.

Focus of work: 1) popn or subgroup supplem ent uptake levels 2) knowledge or awareness or attitudes 3) research interventi on 4) population wide intervention or campaign 5) Expert Committee report 2 Methods The survey was carried out by research and evaluation services on behalf of the Health Promotion Agency for Northern Ireland, and has conducted as part of the January 1999 edition of the Northern Ireland's Social Omni bus survey. In total 1000 interviews were conducted with the proportionate probability based random sample of the Northern Ireland adult population. A response rate of 66.2 per cent was achieved Results 1) Compared with a similar survey in 1996 th e current survey found a significant increase in the overall level of awareness of Folic acid (73 pe r cent in 1999 compared with 45 per cent in 1996) in Northern Ireland, with awareness le vels highest among women as well as those in the 25-44y age group. As in the 1996 survey, television advertising was found to be the main source of respondent awareness of Folic aci d, with television news features and documentaries also identified as a source of awareness by a significant proportion of respondents. 2) The current survey found some evidence of an increase in respondent knowledge of why Folic acid should be taken as well as when it should be taken. Again this represents a marked increase on the levels of knowledge found the 1996 survey 3) The survey also sought to make some assessment of the agency's Folic acid campaign, which used a variety of different approaches including te levision advertising, leaflets, posters and magazine articles. Overall the survey found th at the majority of respondents, 55 per cent, could recall either seeing or hearing at least one element of the agency's campaign, with 47 per cent be able to recall the Folic acid televi sion advertisement, 20 per cent the poster, 15 per cent the leaflet, and 10 percent the magazine article. The targeting of women in the campaign would also appear to have been effective with a significantly greater proportion of women being able to recall at least one element of the campaign as well as specific elements 4) In terms of potential usage of the Folic acid supplement amongst women of child-bearing age, the survey revealed that if women are aware that Folic acid is a vitamin supplement which can help prevent neural tube defects if taken be fore and during pregnancy, then almost all, 94 per cent, of women in the target group said they would take a supplement. This would suggest that providing this group with information on Folic acid supplements andas well as the health benefits from usage, may encourage a higher leve l of uptake of the supplement 5) The survey 126also found a strong association between awarene ss of Folic acid and respondents' likelihood of recommending the use of Folic acid to some one they knew who was planning a pregnancy. Any information on theoretical models used No Authors conclusions The survey revealed an increase level of awar eness of Folic acid since 1996 with a relatively high level of recalled of the Agency's Folic acid campaign. In seeking to further promote the use of Folic acid supplements the survey found that television was the main source of awareness. 127Citation Hilton JJ (2002): Folic acid intake of young women.

Univariate analysis showed that white women were 5.7 [95% confidence interval (CI) 2.5, 13.2] times more likely to have taken folic acid supplements before concepti on than Bangladeshi women. Having controlled for the variables, age, school leaving age, social class, parity, planned pregnancy and 'heard of folic acid', ethnic status remained a significant pr edictor of taking folic acid, with the odds ratio dropping to 5.2 with a 95% CI (1.1, 25.2).

Results Of the women 67% consumed folate-containi ng supplements in the first trimester of pregnancy and 43% reported taking folate be fore becoming pregnant. Women under the age of 21 years were less likely to take folate s upplements than women over the age of 21 years (p = 0.007), as were smokers (p < 0.001) and wome n from lower social classes. Mean folate intakes, including supplements, were 511 +/ - 17 micrograms per day and unsupplemented dietary intakes were 237 +/- 5 micrograms per day.

The central component of the direct mail/pharmacy information intervention was the mailing of \"starter kits\" of 100 multivitamins, while the provider education intervention used primary care providers to deliver the study message. Ma in outcomes included the use of multivitamins containing folic acid at least four times per week (\"regularly\"), intention to use multivitamins regularly, and knowledge and attitudes about multivitamins. Outcomes were measured via telephone interviews of nonpregnant women of childbearing age. Results A total of 3438 women were interviewed. Th ere was a small but significant increase in the percentage of women using multivitamins in the direct mail/pharmacy information intervention group at the beginning of the in tervention period (p =0.006), but this increase was not sustained after the interventions ende d.

The proportion using pre-conceptional folic acid increased by approximately 1% per month du ring the 22 months of the study. 38.1% (367/962) (35 1 to 41.2) of women began ta king folic acid only after the confirmation of pregnancy, and this proportion appeared c onstant over time. Young age, smoking and low educational attainment were statistically signifi cant predictors of failure to use folic acid both before and during pregnancy. Any information on theoretical models used No Authors conclusions Use of folic acid before conception in nullipar ous women is much higher than the 2% to 3% reported in earlier studies of all pregnant wome n, and appears to be increasing. However, many women still only begin taking folic acid after conception, despite current health education strategies. New approaches, focusi ng on women who are currently least likely to take folic acid those who are young, are of lo w educational backgrounds, and are smokers - may now be required. Given the inevitably of u nplanned pregnancies, efforts must also be made to increase the currently static uptake of folic acid immediately after the confirmation of pregnancy. 140Citation McDonnell R, Johnson Z, Doyle A & Sayers G ( 1999): Determinants of folic acid knowledge and use among antenatal women.

A univariate analysis of data was undertaken followed by a multivariate analysis using logistic regression to determine factors predicting knowledge and use of folic acid. Results Seventy-six per cent of respondents had heard of folic acid, 16 per cent had taken it before pregnancy and 51 per cent during pregnancy. Wo men who had planned their pregnancy, were married and were relatively affluent were signifi cantly more likely to have heard of folic acid, to know that it could prevent neural tube de fects and to have taken it peri-conceptionally. Less affluent women tended to use their general practitioner (GP) more as a source of information and advice than those who were bette r off. In multivariate analysis, marriage and planned pregnancy were impor tant predictors of folic acid knowledge whereas planned pregnancy advice given before pregnancy and relative affluen ce were predictive of peri- conceptional use. Any information on theoretical models used No Authors conclusions Many women know of folic acid but do not ta ke it peri-conceptionally. Women may associate folic acid with pregnancy and less with pre-pr egnancy. Greater emphasis on peri-conceptional use should improve folic acid uptake. Focusing on less affluent women for folic acid promotion by GPs and other primary care professionals is also important. 141Citation Morgan C, Klein DA & Selbst M (2004): Usi ng CD-ROM technology to increase folic acid knowledge among physician assistant stude nts.

The questionnaire was administered by the midwife before taking the booking his tory. All women participated in the study voluntarily after verbal consent was given. Results Even though the majority of women, 76% (n = 761) said they knew about the benefits of folic acid before they became pregnant, only 43% (n = 433) took folic acid pre-pregnancy . A further 40% (n = 404) of women took folic acid as soon as pregnancy was confirmed. In these women the mean gestation for starting folic aci d was 6.6 weeks (range 4\u00b1 16 weeks). Of the women, 773 planned their pregnancy (i.e. wome n not using any form of contraception around the time of conception) and 644 of these women claimed they knew about the benefits of folic acid before getting pregnant. Even in this group of informed women who planned their pregnancy 33% (n = 211) of them did not take folic acid pre-pregnancy. A further 13% (n = 129) of women planned their pregnancy but becau se they were not aware of the benefits of folic acid did not take it until it was too late . Ninety-eight (10%) women attending the ANC said that they had not heard about folic acid despite having seen their general practitioner or community midwife before referral to the hosp ital. Twenty-three per cent (n = 228) of women had visited a health professional (GP, family pl anning clinic or gynaecologist) in the months preceding pregnancy.

Of all respondents, 63% were aware of the need for preconceptional folic acid. Key information sources were family doctors and the mass media: the media were more important before conception, doctors after. Being older (30 years or more), having post- secondary education, and having a planned pre gnancy were associated with knowing about the benefits of folic acid; knowledge, regular exercise, perceived good health, and planned pregnancy were associated with preconceptional use of vitamins Any information on theoretical models used No Authors conclusions Even in this sample of well educated, Eng lish-speaking women, only one third took vitamin supplements before conception, which indicates that current educational efforts do not reach most women early enough. A coordinated, multi- pronged strategy that targets and involves physicians and capitalizes on opportunities to work with schools, public health outlets, and the media is needed. 147Citation Oleary M, Donnell RM & Johnson H (2001): Folic acid and prevention of neural tube defects in 2000 improved awareness--low peri-c onceptional uptake.

Thirty-five percent of Spanish- speaking patients and 56.3% of English-speaking patients (difference, P <.001) were aware of nonspecific benefits of vitamin intake and the prevention of congenital malformations. A mere 1.2% of women with <4 years of high school education were consuming a multivitamin supplement preconceptionally compared with 46% of those with any education beyond high school (P <.0001). Spanish-speaking patients were significantly less likely to be consuming a vitamin supplement preconceptionally when comp ared with English-speaking patients (3.7% vs 22.4%; P <.0001). Among the 25 patients who demonstrated a specific knowledge of the ability of folic acid intake to prevent neural tube defects, 92% were English speaking compared with 8% who were Spanish speaking (P <.0001). Any information on theoretical models used No Authors conclusions There is a critical lack of use and understandi ng regarding the importance of periconceptional folic acid intake to prevent neural tube def ects. Our Spanish-speaking population and those with less formal education appear particul arly vulnerable to not benefiting from the advantages of periconceptional folic acid. Edu cational efforts at promoting knowledge and use of folic acid need to incorporate strate gies addressing the Spanish-speaking population. 149Citation Power ML, Holzman GB & Schulkin J (2000): K nowledge and clinical regarding folic acid among obstetrician-gynecologists.

Approxima tely two thirds of respondents screen their pregnant patients for folate intake. Fewe r (53%) screen their nonpregnant patients of childbearing age. Those who screened their patie nts for folate intake were more likely to counsel pregnant patients about diet. They also were more likely to believe that nutritional counseling would improve pregnancy outcomes (70.0% versus 56.5%) and overall patient health (77.5% versus 66.5%). Most Fellows were aware that macrocytic anemia was a manifestation of folate deficiency (90.4% ) and that folic acid supplementation during preconception and the early prenatal period helps protect against neural tube defects (96.5%). They were aware that alcoholics (91.4%), smokers (61.3%), and lactating women (53.5%) are at increased risk of folate deficiency. They were less aware of other consequences of low folate intake, such as increased serum homocy steine (20.3%). Respondents who screen their pregnant patients for folate intake correctly answered more of the knowledge questions about folate than physicians who do not screen. Any information on theoretical models used No Authors conclusions Obstetrician-gynecologists are generally aware of the link between folate intake and neural tube defects, but are less aware of other aspects of folate metabolism. 150Citation Public Health Agency of Canada (2003) Evalua tion of Food Fortification with Folic Acid for the Primary Prevention of Neural Tube Defects.

Data was collected through random telephone surveys in the three sites Results There was a significant increase from Phase I to Ph ase II in the proportion of women aged 19- 44 who knew the importance of folic acid in Newfoundland (two sites combined) (from 33% to 46%, p<0.001) and in Kingston, Ontario (from 36% to 51%, p<0.001). The proportion of women taking a vitamin supplement containing folic acid increased significantly between the two time periods in Newfoundland (from 17% to 28%, p<0.003), but increased non- significantly in Kingston, Ontario (from 33% to 39%, p> 0.05) In Ontario, the proportion of women who reported taking supplements with at least 400 g folic acid per dose increased between Phase I and Phase II (from 17% to 26% , p<0.005). Information about folic acid dosage was not collected in Newfoundland. In the Phase II Newfoundland sample, women who were trying to conceive or who were se xually active and not using birth control were more likely to be taking supplements containi ng folic acid than women who were using birth control or who had taken permanent measures to prevent pregnancy. There was a 37 % increase in use of supplements containing folic acid among women with a chance of pregnancy in Phase II in Newfoundland (p=0.02). Although there was also an increase in the Ontario sample, the results were not statistically significant Any information on theoretical models used No Authors conclusions This study suggests that the message to take folic acid is not getting through to enough women of childbearing age, despite a range of national and local educational initiatives, including development and dissemination of Ca nadian clinical practice guidelines (Canadian Task Force on the Periodic Health Examina tion 1994), well-publicized national conferences and local public health campaigns. Although we have shown some increase over three years in folic acid supplement use, consider able room for improvement remains 151Citation Quillin JM, Silberg J, Board P, Pratt L & B odurtha J (2000): College women's awareness and consumption of folic acid for the prevention of neural tube defects.

Results 1) Twenty-three (32%) subjects cl aimed they currently take multivitamin supplements, and 48 (68%) subjects said they did not currently take supplements. Prior to the intervention, 49 (69%) subjects reported having heard of NT Ds, and 22 (31%) subjects reported they had not heard of NTDs. Forty-six (64%) subjects re ported having heard about folic acid, although only 4 (5%) subjects correctly identified 0.4 mg as the recommended daily allowance (RDA) of folic acid. 2) . No significant association was found between perception of pregnancy likelihood and having heard of folic acid (X2=2.078, P = 0.556) nor was there an association between perception of pregna ncy likelihood and multivitamin consumption (X2=1.624, P = 0.654). 3) Subjects w ho had heard about folic acid were more likely to believe in the benefits of folic acid compared with those who had not heard of folic acid (P < 0.01). Likewise, subjects who had heard about folic acid perceived barriers to taking folic acid to be easier to overcome (P < 0.05). No ot her significant differences were identified with respect to any other belief variables (HBM or FHLCS) among those who were and were not aware of folic acid. With regard to any belief variables, no significant differences were found between those who did and did not consume multivitamins regularly, nor among those who had or had not heard about NTDs. Any information on theoretical models used Health Belief Model;Fetal Locus of Control Authors conclusions Belief variables related to folic acid were not associated with multivitamin consumption. Thus, subjects who currently take vitamin s upplements do not appear to do so because of beliefs explored in this study nor do they consume vitamin supplements because of an awareness of folic acid or of NTDs. These findings might have important implications for 152constructing effective educational interventions . Many current campaigns to increase folic acid consumption focus on education about the pr eventive effects of daily maternal folic acid use. Our data do not predict the success of su ch campaigns in a college population. In particular, locus of control variables were not associated with multivitamin consumption (powerful others, P = 0.439; chance, P = 0.352; internal control, P = 0.481). In other words, subjects' motivation to take multivitamins contai ning folic acid was not related to their beliefs in their abilities to influence the outcome of pr egnancy. This finding is further supported by the lack of an association between fetal health locus of control and having heard about folic acid (powerful others, P = 0.154; chance, P = 0.950; internal control, P = 0.400). Both of these findings and the general disbelief in pregnancy susceptibility suggest that these subjects are not focused on preconceptional care.CONCLUSION: This study does not support educational interventions based on the HBM or FHLCS to increase multivitamin consumption among college women. 153Citation Quinn LA, Thompson SJ & Ott MK (2005): Application of the social ecological model in folic acid public health initiatives.

A search of several databases, including MEDLINE, PsychINF O, and CINAHL, was conducted for articles containing the search term folic acid education, published in English, between 1990 and 2003. The search yielded 56 articles. The articles were screened, and any article that did not identify an ecological approach in meeting educational needs specific to folic acid was rejected. After this process, 10 articles were included in this review. These articles identify folic acid public health initiatives from 1999 through 2003. Results As a comprehensive community-based health promotion program, the National Folic Acid Campaign supports a social ecological approach to health promotion. Strategies in the campaign specific to an ecological approach are evident in (a) coalition development and approaches to community involvement; (b) e ducational approaches used, including social marketing techniques and mass media campaigns; and (c) policy development regarding folic acid. Most statewide folic acid campaigns do not incorporate all levels of the social ecological model into the design of their health promotion programs. However, most include interventions in at least two levels. Any information on theoretical models used Social Ecological model Authors conclusions Evaluation of the effectiveness of campaigns a nd health initiatives aimed at improving folic acid consumption among women of childbearing age have focused on identifying the behavior itself, rather than on which campaign strategies were effective in changing the behavior. For example, state and national campaigns have evaluated program effectiveness by identifying an increase in folic acid knowledge or folic acid intake among women of childbearing age, without identifying which campaign strategies effected any identified increases to folic acid knowledge or folic aci d intake. Investigating ways to isolate components that offer the most effective appr oaches to helping individuals make healthy lifestyle choices in their daily lives is a challenge that must be addressed. 154Citation Raats M, Thorpe L, Hurren C & Elliott K (1998) Changing Preconceptions: Volume 2 (Research Report).

The three strands to achieving this were to encourage the consumption of foods naturally rich in folate, to increase the av ailability and intake of foods fortified with folic acid, and to encourage the use of appr opriate dose folic acid supplements in women planning a pregnancy. The programme w as based on creating partnerships with the voluntary, public and commercial sectors, at both local and national levels. The three elements which will be described in more detail were a) public communication including media advocacy b) working with health professi onals, and c) working within the commercial sector. The Folic acid campaign was underpinned by an extensive programme of research at all stages of its planning, execution and evalua tion. The research focused on the campaign's three target groups: the public, professionals a nd the commercial sector. Strategic qualitative research was commissioned during the campaign planning and development stage. As the campaign grew to include a broader target audi ence, namely 'future planners of pregnancy', further qualitative research was carried out. Qu antitative tracking surveys were also carried out at intervals throughout the campaign to m onitor progress in raising awareness of Folic acid and the specific messages of the campaign Results Research found that: 1. Spontaneous i e unprompted awareness of Folic acid among women of child-bearing age increased from 9% in 1995 49% in 1998 2. Prompted awareness among women of child-bearing age rose from 51% in 1995 to 89 % in 1998 3. The percentages of pregnant women and new mothers claiming to have taken Folic acid rose between 1997 and 1998: when trying for baby 24 % to 38 %; during the first 12 weeks of pregnancy from 54% to 68 %; at some time during pregnancy from 73 % to 76% 4. 1 % of health professionals spontaneously identified Folic acid as 'very important' for women planning a pregnancy in 1997, compared with 55 % in 1996 1555. 49 % of health professionals who had seen Campaign Information claimed to have changed their practice as a result 6. The range of fortified products and supplements increased 7. The number of licensed 400 microgram Folic acid supplements increased from one in 1996 to two in 1998 8. The number of unlicensed 400 microgram Folic acid supplements increased from nine in 1996 to 17 in 1998 9. Prescription rates for Folic acid increased Any information on theoretical models used No Authors conclusions It should be recognised that despite the achieveme nts described in this report, three years is a relatively short period for a Health Promotion Initiative, particularly when compared with ongoing efforts to reduce smoking over last 30 years or to raise awareness about HIV and Aids over the past 13 years. It is interesting to note that at approximately the same time as the launch of the Folic acid campaign, the Department of Health issued separate advice regarding pregnancy and liver consumption. However, th ere has been no public campaign relating to liver consumption during pregnancy, so awaren ess of this advice which remains relatively low and consistent, provides a useful comparison with awareness of Folic acid, which has increased substantially, largely as a result of the dedicated public education campaign 156Citation Ray JG, Singh G & Burrows RF (2004): Evidence for suboptimal use of periconceptional folic acid supplements globally.

Bibliographies of retrieved referenc es were scanned for other relevant publications, and authors were contacted if necessary. Studies we re included that evaluated the rate of folic acid supplement use either before conception or in early pregnancy. Results A total of 52 studies were included. In 34 studies, reported preconceptional folic acid use varied from 0.9% to 50%. In 49 studies, the re ported rate of periconceptional supplement use ranged from 0.5% to 52%. Significant predictors of reduced periconceptional folic acid use were a low level of formal education, immigran t status, young maternal age, lack of a partner and an unplanned pregnancy. Four studies ( HEA campaign in the UK; van der Pal 2000 & de Walle 2002 - Dutch campaign; Chan 2001 - Austra lian campaign) and examined the effect of mass media campaigns on periconceptional folic acid use; the reported rates increased significantly, by a factor of 1.7 to 7.2, but in no study was the post-campaign rate above 50% Any information on theoretical models used No Authors conclusions 1) It is discouraging, but not surprising, that PLANNED PREGNANCY RATES remain low in many industrialised countries. Not only is an unplanned pregnancy associated with a low rate of preconceptional folic acid use, but it is also a major determinant of poor antenatal care in general. Thus, while public education programs should seek to increase folic acid consumption among all women of reproductive age, programs aimed at encouraging planned pregnancy should clearly also promote folic acid supplement use. Another practical message is that, in lieu of often-low rates of pl anned pregnancy, better approaches are needed to ensure that folic acid is delivered to the em bryo before neural tube closure at 22-28 days postconception. Finding that the best tablet s upplementation programs reach at most 50% of women is a very strong argument for folic aci d fortification of a centrally processed and widely eaten food, such as wheat, corn and rice flour. 2) While PUBLIC 157AWARENESS CAMPAIGNS appear to highlight th e benefits of folic acid, and may enhance its use, this review suggests that some wome n may not receive or comprehend this message, and, even when they do, proper use of folic acid supplements remains low. For example, one folic acid awareness campaign was conducted in southwestern Virginia using media advertisements and a teaching package for grades 5-12 (CDC 1999). Although folic acid awareness among women aged 18-45 years incr eased from 31% to 75%, knowledge about the proper time to use folic acid remains unchange d. In a cluster randomised clinical trial in Victoria, Australia, three communities of wome n were exposed to a public-wide information campaign, and three were not, between July and October 1997 (Watson 1999). Folic acid awareness increased from 12% pre- to 20% postc ampaign, but only 13% of women in the latter period were aware of the correct timing of folic acid use. Lack of correct use seems especially true among young, single women, those without a formal education and those who are recent immigrants. Thus, methods should be developed to better deliver this message, paying attention to lan guage and cultural barriers, literacy and ready access to health care providers and inexpensive folic acid-containing vitamin tablets before conception. Perhaps it is also necessary to re-think 'antenatal care' as something that starts before conception, akin to models of care provided to women with di abetes mellitus and epilepsy, for example. Such an approach was quite successful in one Dutch study of women attending an infertility clinic (De Weerd 2002) At the same time, we mu st continue to ensure that primary care clinicians\u2014 those most likely to attend to young women\u2014remain knowledgeable about the proper use of folic acid before conception. CONCLUSION: In many countries, fewer than 50% of women take periconceptional folic acid supplements. Consideration should be given to the practical advantages of folic acid for tification of centrally processed foods, such as wheat, corn and rice flour, while further promoting vitamin tablet supplement use and planned pregnancy 158Citation Relton CL, Hammal DM, Rankin J & Parker L (2005): Folic acid supplementation and social deprivation.

Younger women and more socially deprived women were less likely to use folic acid supplements before 4 weeks of gestation. Women with a family histor y of neural tube defects were no more likely to take folic acid than were women with no family history of neural tube defects. Any information on theoretical models used No Authors conclusions A high proportion of women reported taking folic acid supplements during pregnancy but less than half took them at the most important time in early pregnancy. Younger women and women who were more socio-economically deprived were much less likely to take folic acid during the critical periconceptional period. Future strategies should promote prenatal folic acid supplementation in women under the age of 24 and in women of low socio-economic status. 159Citation Robbins JM, Cleves MA, Collins Smith (2005): Randomized trial of a physician-based inte rvention to increase the use of folic acid supplements among women.

Self-reported folic acid use w as compared at baseline and at 2 months. Results Of the 279 patients who completed the study, weekly folic acid intake increased in the intervention group by 68%, compared with 20% in the control group ( P =.008). No significant differences were found in daily inta ke. The women who were most influenced by the intervention were black and lower income and not planning pregnancies.The likelihood that black women in the intervention group incr eased to weekly use of folic acid was almost 3 times that of black women in the control group . The intervention was also most effective among women with annual household incomes $30, 000 and women not planning pregnancy.

Results Overall, 33.2% of women took folic acid most days in the month before becoming pregnant, and 39.9% said that their pregnancy was unint ended. Adolescent mothers were less likely to take periconceptional folic acid (9.2%) and more likely to report unintended pregnancy (62.0%) than older women. Overall, women w ho said that their pregnancy was intended were more likely to report that they had taken pe riconceptional folic acid (odds ratio: 4.75; 95% confidence interval: 3.16-7.14); after controlling for maternal age and income the odds ratio was 3.70 (95% confidence interval: 2.38-5.56) Any information on theoretical models used No Authors conclusions Women whose pregnancies were intended were more like ly to have been taking periconceptional folic acid than women whose pregnancies were unintended.

Ninety-one per cent (174/191) of participants had heard of folic acid and, of these, 63% knew that folic acid reduces the risk of spina bifida. Of the 191 participants in the study, 118(62%) took folic acid supplements at some stage of their pregnancy, however, only 33(17% ) had taken periconceptual folic acid supplements. Of the 44% of all women in the study with a pla nned pregnancy, only 35% had taken folic acid supplements periconceptually. Of those wome n with an unplanned pregnancy (55%), only 2.8% had taken a folic acid supplement peric onceptually. The main sources of advice for women relating to folic acid were general practiti oners (48%) or media advertising, either in the form of a magazine, or health pamphlet or television promotion (20%). Any information on theoretical models used No Authors conclusions The results of this study indicate that the level of knowledge amongst women of child-bearing age relating to folic acid is relatively high co mpared with other countries. Despite this high level of knowledge, only a small percentage of women are actually consuming a folic acid supplement during the recommended periconceptual period due in part to the high proportion of unplanned pregnancies. These results emphasize the need for an effective public health strategy to ensure that all women of child-bear ing age have access to an adequate folic acid intake. 163Citation Sen S, Manzoor A, Deviasumathy M & Newt on C (2001): Maternal knowledge, attitude and practice regarding folic acid intake during the pe riconceptional period.

Less than half (44.6%) had taken FA in the periconceptional period, and this was far more common in the more 'privileged' classes. Low socio-econom ic status, age less than 30 years, lower educational status and unplanned pregnancy were high risk factors for not taking FA. The challenge to the medical profession for targ eting this group cannot be over-emphasised. 164Citation Sillender M (2000): Continuing low uptake of periconceptional fola te warrants increased food fortification.

Data were collected on: supplementation and dietary intake of folic acid, both preconceptionally and after confirmation of pregnancy; awareness of the be nefits of folic acid; source of information on folic acid; the reasons for not taking folic acid (if this was so); planned or unplanned pregnancy; previous pregnancies; previous neural tube defect in a pregnancy; smoking habit; and age Results Eighty-one per cent of women were aware of the benefits of folic acid, but only 27% took it preconceptionally. Sixty-eight per cent took it afte r confirmation of pregnancy. A quarter of patients made an attempt to increase dietary folate. Unplanned pregnancy was a significant bar to uptake, with significant differences in awareness and consumption. Number of pregnancies had no effect. Older women were more likely to take postconceptional folate, but awareness and preconceptional use we re the same as younger women. Any information on theoretical models used No Authors conclusions Despite an extensive campaign commissioned by the Department of Health and run by the Health Education Authority, use of pericon ceptional folate will probably only prevent one- sixth of affected pregnancies. The adverse effect s of fortification discussed in the body of this paper are small.

Results Following the campaign, significantly more women (before their pregnancy) had read written material recommending the use of preconceptional folic acid (61\u00b41% rising to 76%). They had also been advised to take folic acid befo re getting pregnant by many different sources. The amount of advice increased from all sour ces following the campaign, although only advice from a nurse (3\u00b41\u00b1 9\u00b43%) reached statistical significance. As a result of both these factors, use of preconceptional folic acid increased by a very significant amount (27\u00b41\u00b1 48%). GPs were significantly more likely to prescribe folic acid preconceptionally following the campaign (3\u00b41\u00b1 14\u00b47%). Consumption of folate rich food increased (but did not reach significance). Overall, the most common reason given for not taking folic acid preconceptionally was unplanned pregnancy (86/33 7, 25\u00b45%). Other important reasons were non-awareness of folate (52/337, 15\u00b44%), and aw areness without being convinced of efficacy (28/337, 8\u00b43%). Cost was a less important factor (7/337, 2\u00b41%). When non-awareness of folate as a reason for non-compliance is calcula ted for the two samples described above, there is a significant reduction from 46/262 (17\u00b46%) to 6/75 (8%), c 2=4\u00b408, P=0\u00b404. None of the changes in other reasons for non-compliance reac hed statistical significance. there was no statistically significant change in postcon ceptional-only folic acid consumption, although consumption of tablets fell from 49\u00b41% to 38\u00b47%, c 2=3\u00b472, P=0\u00b405. .

The most commonly cited sources of information were the woman's general practitioner (43.0%) and magazines (41.7%). Overall, 13% of women reported taking multivita mins containing folic acid on a daily basis. Failure to take supplements was significa ntly associated with lower education.

A mass media approach was used. Also, using advertisements in newspapers and women's magazines, TV and radio commercial s and posters in the waiting rooms of GPs, midwives and gynaecologists, the attention of women wishing to conceive was drawn to a brochure about folic acid, which was available fr ee at the pharmacist. The brochure explained what folic acid is and that it is not available in sufficient quantities in our daily food. It also described what neural tube defects are and that by using folic acid it is possible to reduce the risk of having an affected child. Furthermore, the brochure gave information on the period in which folic acid should be used, on the dosage a nd on where folic acid could be obtained. An additional local campaign was targeted at women with a low SES. METHODS: Two cross- sectional surveys were carried out to assess the effectiveness of the national and additional local Folic Acid Campaign. The first survey was just before the start of the national campaign (September to November 1995; 1995 survey); the second survey was 1 year after the campaign (September to November 1996; 1996 surv ey). Data were collected in four regions in The Netherlands. In the Randstad (west) and Noord-Nederland (north) regions, only the national campaign was conducted. These regions were combined in the analysis and are referred to as the region with the national ca mpaign. In the Midden- Brabant (south) and Achterhoek (east) regions, the national and th e additional local campaigns were both implemented. These two regions were also comb ined for the analysis and are referred to as the region with the additional local campaign. Data were gathered by means of a structured questionnaire that was based on the questionnair e developed from a study about channels to be used for folic acid educati on, attitude and social influen ce. It was handed to pregnant women visiting a midwife, obstetrician or gene ral practitioner for the first or second prenatal visit (around 12 or 16 weeks of pregnancy respectively). Results AWARENESS: The percentage of women who re ported that they had heard of folic acid before the last menstrual period increased from 41. 7% in 1995 to 77.3% in 1996. In 1995, the frequency with which women with a low educati onal level reported that they had heard of folic acid was lower than that of women with a high level of education (28.1% vs. 57.5%). In 1691996, the figures had increased to 63.6% and 88.0% respectively. In 1995, 94.7% of the respondents who had heard of folic acid knew when to use it, compared with 93.7% in 1996 . There was no difference in knowledge between the region with the national campaign and the region with the additional local campaign in 1995 and 1996. In 1995, women with a low level of education in the region with the national ca mpaign were slightly less likely to indicate an accurate knowledge of the matter than women with a high level of education in this region (87.3% vs. 97.9% respectively; P < 0.01). In 1996, this difference had levelled (91.9% vs. 93.8% respectively). PERCEIVED SAFETY: Overall, the mean score for perceived safety increased from 0.74 in 1995 to 0.81 in 1996 ( P < 0.05. In both 1995 and 1996, women with a low level of education had a lower mean score on perceived safety than women with a high level (1995: 0.60 vs. 0.87 respectively; P 0.001). ATTITUDES: The mean score for attitude towards folic acid use increased from 1.09 in 1995 to 1.29 in 1996 ( P < 0.001) SUBJECTIVE NORM: The mean score for subjective norm, the result of the beliefs of the respondent about what others think of folic acid use, increased from - 0.35 in 1995 to - 0.09 in 1996 ( P < 0.001 ). No difference was found in increase in mean score for subjective norm from 1995 to 1996 across regions. In 1995, the mean score for subjective norm in wome n with a low level of education was similar to that for women with a high level. In 1996, there was a difference, but this difference occurred only in the region with the national campaign. FOLIC ACID USE during the time around conception increased from 16.8% in 1 995 to 48.6% in 1996 . In both 1995 and 1996, use was higher in women with a high leve l of education (1995: 27.4% vs. 9.7%, 1996: P < 0.001). The difference in folic acid use between women of different educational levels remained the same in the region with the national campaign and increased in the region with the additional local campaign Any information on theoretical models used The framework used was similar to the central constructs of the theory of reasoned action. The data from the 1995 survey were used to test the hypothetical model of determinants. The behavioural model that resulted from the logistic regression analysis included attitude, subjective norm and perceived safety, while aw areness knowledge appeared to affect folic acid use through subjective norm and perceive d safety. The criterion variable of the conceptual model was folic acid use during so me period around conception. The model was confirmed by analysing the data from the 1996 su rvey and appeared to be consistent among women with different levels of education. Authors conclusions Overall, a mass media approach was effectiv e in informing women about folic acid use. However, even though complementary channels were introduced to reach women with a low educational level, these women were not reached to the same extent as women with a high level of education. Women with a low level of education had heard of folic acid less often than women with a high level. This differ ence already existed before the onset of the campaigns and persisted after the campaigns had been implemented. In the region with the additional local campaign, women with a low le vel of education had derived as much benefit from the campaigns as their better educated counterpa rts. This indicates that, in that region for women with a low educational level, the subj ective norm changed more in a positive direction than in the region with only the national campai gn. As women with a low level of education seem to be more sensitive to th e social environment, this could be the key to success in reducing differences in folic acid use between women of different educational levels. This should be explored in new health promotion strategies 170Citation Vollset SE & Lande B (2000): Knowledge and attitudes of folate, and use of dietary supplements among women of reproductive age in Norway 1998.

Results Among the women aged 18-45 years, 50.4% had heard about folate, 32.9% knew about its role in pregnancy and 9.5% that it may prevent a malformation. Only 4.0% of the women knew that the critical period for folate supplemen tation to prevent a neural tube defect is before and early in pregnancy. The strongest determinants of knowledge were closeness to a pregnancy and educational level. Dietary supplem ents were used daily or almost daily by 53.3% of the women. The most commonly used types were multivitamin supplements and cod liver oil while only 0.9% of the women re ported current use of supplemental folate. The women were also asked about use of folate and dietary supplements before or early in their last pregnancy: 44.3% reported that they had used a dietary supplement and 2.4% had used folate. Among the few women who had been pregnant within the last year of the interview, 10.3% reported use of a folate supplement. Overall, 56.0% of the women stated that they would use a folate supplement in a future pr egnancy and 66.7% that they wanted more information about folate Any information on theoretical models used No Authors conclusions Although about half of Norwegian women had heard about folate in 1998, just below 10% knew that it could prevent a malformation. Use of folate supplements was low in 1998, but more than half of the women stated that th ey would use folate supplements in a future pregnancy. 171Citation Wald NJ (2005): Use of folic acid supplements.

Knowledge that folic acid can prevent NTD also rose from 21% to 66% (c2 test for trend: p<0.001). Although the proportion who took folic acid during pregnancy increased from 14% to 83% from 1996 to 2002 (c2 test for trend: p<0.001), peri-conceptional intake did not ri se above 24% in any year. There is a high awareness of folic acid and its relation to NTD, which is not matched by peri-conceptional uptake. The main barrier to peri-conceptional uptake is the lack of pregnancy planning. Any information on theoretical models used No Authors conclusions To date promotional campaigns appear to have been ineffective in reducing the prevalence of NTD in Ireland. Consequently, fortification of staple foodstuffs is the only practical and reliable means of primary prevention of NTD. 173Citation Watkins ML, Brustrom J & Schulman J (2004): Effectiveness of a free folic acid supplement program in family planning clinics.

Three clinics provided folic acid pills and educational materials to clients, tw o provided super-fortified cereal and educational materials, and one clinic provi ded educational materials only. Participants between the ages of 18 and 45 who visited the clinics in 2000 completed a brief survey and provided a blood sample. Of the 1093 women who participated, th e 165 women who had returned to the clinic at least once during the study period were eval uated. Participants' survey and serum folate data from their first and subsequent visits was compared. Results General : Participation in the intervention was associated with increased knowledge about folic acid, (odds ratio, 1.94; 95% confidence interval, 1.37-2.76), but was not directly associated with increased self-reported folic aci d consumption or increased serum folate levels. However, the odds of reporting folic acid consumption within two days of a visit were twice as large for participants who answered one or two of the knowledge questions correctly. Reported use of folic acid supplements or cereal within two days of a visit was associated with higher serum folate levels. Knowledge about folic acid was one of the best predictors of self-reported folic acid consumption. Free supplements : The cereal intervention increased par ticipants' knowledge that folic acid prevents birth defects from 29 to 38% (p = 0.07), and the education-only intervention increased knowledge about appropriate timing of folic acid use (38-58%, p = 0.07), but neither was significant at the 0.05 level. Only the pill intervention was associated with a significantly increased reported consumption of folic acid (23-42%, p = 0.03). Any information on theoretical models used No Authors conclusions Participation in the intervention increased c lients' knowledge about folic acid but did not directly increase reported folic acid consump tion. Because knowledge predicted folic acid 174consumption, the intervention may be indirec tly associated with increased consumption of folic acid. 175Citation Watson LF, Brown SJ & Davey MA (2006): Use of periconceptional folic acid supplements in Victoria and New South Wales, Australia.

In Victoria, 8%, and in NSW, 28% of women had increased dietary folate intake. In both surveys you nger women, women with less education, less income, of non-English speaking background and women who were not married were less likely to take folate supplements in the r ecommended period. In Victoria, multiparous women were significantly less likely to take supple ments. In NSW, women with an unplanned pregnancy and those living in rural areas were significantly less likely to take periconceptional folate supplements. Fifty- three per cent of women cited a general practitioner or obstetrician as a source of folate information and 45% cited family or friends; both of these sources were significantly asso ciated with periconceptional folate supplementation. Any information on theoretical models used No Authors conclusions Less than 50% of women took periconcepti onal folate supplements.

Any information on theoretical models used No Authors conclusions Women had increased concerns having seen fola te promotional material and after being interviewed about it. These results are consistent with the proposition that an initial emotional response to sensitive health information is part of an adaptive response appropriate to the process of health-related behaviour change. 177Citation Watson M, Watson L, Bell R & Halliday J (2001): The increasing knowledge of the role of periconceptional folate in Victorian women of child-bearing age: follow-up of a randomised community intervention trial.

This is approximately 10% of the population of Victoria. Four rural and two metropolitan (outer suburban) LGAs, geographically isolated from each other, were selected and matched in pairs for similar demographics, ie age, household income, edu cation, occupation and non English-speaking background. A baseline knowledge assessment us ing a telephone questionnaire interview was conducted in November-December 1996. Interv iews were based on random selection of telephone numbers from residential listings fo r the areas concerned. Women aged 15-44 years, with quota of 2% for ages 40-44 years, were selected and 200 women per location sampled. The questionnaires were completed on computer scannable forms. One LGA from each pair was then randomly selected for the publ ic health promotion intervention - a brief program from late July to early October 1997 us ing printed material only, and no radio or television coverage. The printed material, designe d to be eye-catching and have broad appeal, was in the form of posters, leaflets and in formation kits with the posters distributed throughout the community, the leaflets largely in supermarkets and the information kit at pharmacies and Maternal and Child Health Centres. It was designed to increase the knowledge of folate and the prevention of NT Ds in women of child-bearing age. Further evaluations of awareness then took place in November-December 1997 and March-April 2000, again by telephone interview. These as sessments were cross-sectional in that independent random samples were selected on each occasion. Results 12.5% (adjusted for population sampling fraction) of 1,196 women interviewed in 1996, prior to the intervention, were aware of folate and NTDs. Independent surveys after the intervention in 1997 and again in 2000 showed that this had increased to 17.4% (n=1204) and 30.2% (n=1227) respectively. The intervention had a significant impact on folate awareness ( 4% difference in 1997 and a in 2000, ORadj=1.24, 95% CI 1.19-1.37, 178p=0.007).COMMENT: Folate awareness was high est in women aged 25-34 years, the age when most women give birth. Although awaren ess remained low in wome n aged less than 25 years, in that group there has been an in crease in folate awareness since 1997; Folate awareness increased in all age groups since 1997, bu t the impact of the intervention remained only in the 35-44 year age group. Increases in fola te awareness have occurred in all groups of educational and occupational classifications si nce 1997 although the effect was variable across classifications and between intervention and comparison communities. These variations may indicate that the intervention b ased on printed matter was less effective for socially disadvantaged women Any information on theoretical models used No Authors conclusions There has been a continuing increased awarene ss of folate in women of child-bearing age since 1996. Within this setting, the provision of printed educational material in a brief intervention in 1997 has caused enduring incr eased awareness of the association between folate and NTDs.The benefits of the interven tion based on printed matter were not uniformly shared by all population groups. Alternative and ongoing approaches are required to reach all population groups. The need for ongoing health promotion action on folate remains. 179Citation Williams P, McHenery J, McMahon A & Anders on H (2001): Impact evaluation of a folate education campaign with and without the use of a health claim.

Results Awareness of the role of folate in the preventi on of birth defects rose from 21% at baseline to 29% in November 1998 and 44% in May 1999. Awareness of the recommendation to take folate before pregnancy rose by 8% in the fi rst six months of the campaign (without health claims) and by 22% in the second half (when health claims were incorporated). At the end of the campaign, the foods most commonly cite d as sources of folate were leafy green vegetables (72%), breakfast cereals (70%), fruit (41%) and bread (40%). Any information on theoretical models used No Authors conclusions Inclusion of a specific health claim explaining th e role of folate in preventing birth defects appeared to increase the impact of the folate education campaign. 180 APPENDIX 4b: Review 3 papers for which abstracts were downloaded, but which were ex cluded from the study (n =150), with reasons for exclusion .

A written reminder from the GP for a woman to take to the chemist, may make it more likely that the GP's advice is acted on. Could standard prescription forms include a reminder? - Link to contraceptive services - Work with and through Healthy Start - Health promotion initiatives might wo rk through pubs, clubs, nail bars, hair dressers, young offenders' units, unemployment centres - Explore possibility of inco rporating folic acid supplemen ts in welfare schemes, and providing vouchers for free folic acid. - Could information be sent out with Depa rtment of work and pensions advice on benefits? - Begin introducing concept of folic ac id supplementation with young women at school, e.g. in personal and so cial education, and science - Advice and information on sanitary products , toothpaste, toilet paper, popcorn packs in cinemas. - Is it possible to point out ot her benefits of folic acid? Would it be useful if folic acid was identified with a 'number' in a similar way to e.g. riboflavin and thiamin? - Could a sample pack of folic acid supp lements be provided in pregnancy testing kits, or with women's magazines, or in a sleeve in the Pregnancy Book - Could supplements be promoted through a dvertisements in cinemas before the main film starts, or videos in supermarket pharmacy aisles? - The use of the folic acid 'flash' on food products was a successful element of the HEA campaign. Could this be re-invigor ated, or an unambig uous health claim developed for use on folate fortified foods and folic acid supplements? 4 Some of these ideas may fall outside the remit of the Food Standards Agency "}
