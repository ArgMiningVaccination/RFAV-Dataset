Specifically, we will select HCP who test positive and test negative (see Section 4.4.2) and send them an invitation by email and/or text to participate in the project. 4.1 Recruitment Plan Recruitment methods will be site-specific depending on the capabilities and resources available at each site. Each site must submit a Recruitment Plan to the CCC for approval prior to being released to recruit HCP. Potentially eligible HCP will be identified from local employee health records for recruitment in one of two ways: 1) Local employee health departments will provide the site team with a weekly list of HCP who were tested or reported outside testing for COVID with their test results. If employee health departments are able to release HCP names, but not test results, this is acceptable, only if the site team is able to achieve at least a 50% response rate from tested HCP with their test result. 2) Sites whose local employee health department prefers not to release lists of HCP tested to the site team, may also work with an appointed contact (or contacts) within the employee health department to invite HCP to the project. Note, HCP lists will be maintained at the site and will not be shared with the coordinating sites or CDC. The above methods of identifying HCP for recruitment are preferred, but site teams may also use the following methods to supplement identifying potential recruits. 1) From non-employee health clinics that have tested HCPs - For employees who are tested outside their employer (employee health clinic or employer-sponsored testing center); or 2) From employees volunteering - Through e-mails, signs posted in staff patient care areas, screensavers, and other employee-directed communication, HCP who are tested outside the health system and have their test results available for verification purposes are eligible to participate in the project (within 60 days of test). Procedures for identifying potentially eligible HCP for recruitment should be developed to minimize differences between recruitment of cases (test positive for SARS-CoV-2) and controls (test negative for SARS-CoV-2). 4.2 Site-specific Recruitment Log Sites will be directed by the CCC when to initiate recruitment activities. These activities will be conducted by the site project team weekly throughout the surveillance period. Per their site-specific Recruitment Plan, each site team will compile a list of employees who were tested for COVID-19 weekly. To keep consistent with the weekly facility forms completed for each week 8 (see section 5.6), the weekly list will be generated from Sunday (12:00am) to Saturday (11:59pm). This site-specific Recruitment Log must include a list of HCP with their names, COVID test dates, COVID test results, email addresses, and the date the HCP was added to the Recruitment Log. This list will be maintained at the site and will not be sent to PREVENT II coordinating centers or CDC. The sites should note on the Recruitment Log whether the HCP was selected for recruitment (i.e., invitation to participate in PREVENT II sent, Yes or No; see Section 4.4.2). Information from the Recruitment Log will be reported weekly on the weekly facility form in REDCap (section 5.6). Figure 1. Recruitment overview 4.3 Tracking recruitment rates In order to keep track of recruitment rates, all sites will obtain a weekly record (Sunday-Saturday) of the total number of HCP who tested at or reported their test to the site and the total number of HCP who tested positive for COVID. Since it is impossible to obtain the number of HCP who were tested outside of and who did not report their results to employee health departments, we will rely on information available from employee health departments. The number of employees recruited for enrollment should also be tracked and will be reported by sites on a weekly facility form (section 5.6). If available, for all employees tested from the employee health department, sites are encouraged to collect additional information on age, sex, job category, and symptomatic/asymptomatic at time of testing in order to estimate possible recruitment bias. Details of capturing the weekly recruitment rate and maintaining a Recruitment Log should be included in the Recruitment Plan. In addition, the above processes, including generating weekly Weekly List oftested HCPSelected forrecruitmentInvited to participateno earlier 9 data to report to the DCC (see section 5.6), should be tested prior to initiating enrollment. Because the DCC will be reporting data to CDC weekly, timely reports are imperative. 4.4 Selection and Invitation 4.4.1 Site enrollment launch The enrollment launch date for a particular site is the date when a site will begin selecting and inviting/recruiting HCP to enroll in the project from their Recruitment Log. Sites will be released to initiate enrollment when the following tasks/items are completed: 1) approval of the site-specific Recruitment Plan by the CCC, 2) site team testing of their Recruitment Plan to identify any initial issues, 3) site readiness call with the Project Manager, 4) site team required project trainings, including medical records abstraction training quiz completion for relevant site team members, 5) all site team members have access to main REDCap, and 6) receipt of project invitation link for HCP from the DCC. 4.4.2 Definition of cases and controls Cases are defined as those who have a positive SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR, SARS-CoV-2 NAAT test, or SARS-CoV-2 antigen test deployed in routine local medical or public health clinical practice. For cases, a positive test (antigen, molecular/NAAT, or PCR) performed at home is also acceptable. Controls are defined as those with a negative SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR or SARS-CoV-2 NAAT test. Note that due to the low sensitivity of antigen tests, negative SARS-CoV-2 antigen tests alone will NOT be permitted as a single test sufficient to qualify for inclusion as a control participant, but a positive antigen is sufficient for defining a positive case. At the time of selection, the site team may need to rely on HCP or employee health report of their test result and may not be able to confirm whether an HCP case or control meets the above definition. In these instances, participant eligibility will be confirmed after they are selected and invited to participate when they complete the Screening Form (see Section 4.5). After enrollment, participants may be retained even if the result of the reported test differs from the result reported to the study team from the employee health department (usually this will occur in the setting of multiple recent tests). 4.4.3 Selecting potential cases and controls/Using the Selection Macro Depending on the numbers of cases and controls tested in a particular week, the selection macro will adjust to ensure we maintain a case to control ratio of at least 1:1 and at most 1:6: For weeks where more cases than controls are tested (i.e., case to control ratio is greater than or equal to 50), the selection macro will select one case for each control. For weeks where less cases than controls are tested (i.e., the case to control ratio is less than 50%; 1:2, 1:3, 1:4, etc.), 10 all of those with a positive test result (cases) will be selected and a sample of up to 6 negatives for each positive will be randomly selected from all negative tests within the same week. The site team should make sure to maintain a list of duplicate testing and those who decline participation to ensure they are not selected and invited multiple times, selection procedure MUST be completed at least once per week, and cases and corresponding controls must be selected from the same week. If there are no controls available in a particular week, then no participants should be selected and enrolled. The DCC will send sites an algorithm to select cases and controls to invite to the project. This algorithm has been programmed into a Microsoft Excel macro which will be used to select cases and controls each week. Sites will be expected to retain the processed Excel file, if used, to document adherence with selection procedures. To use the Microsoft Excel Macro, update the weekly recruitment list such that all test results are recorded as 1 (positive) or 0 (negative). Split the \"Name of employee\" column into two columns, with the first column \"Last Name\" and the second column \"First Name\". Open the Microsoft Excel Macro. If warning messages appear, select \"yes\" to trust the document, enable content, and enable editing. After doing this, from the weekly recruitment list, copy and paste the columns containing last name, first name, phone number, email address, test date, and test result into the \"Entry\" sheet of the Microsoft Excel Macro. Save the macro as 'PREVENT II mmddyy-mmddyy', where the dates match the Sunday-Saturday dates for that week. Double check the COVID test dates for each HCP to make sure that their test date is within that 7-day period. Once all the information is in the \"Entry\" sheet, click \"Process.\" If any of the columns have missing data, a warning will pop up alerting you of the number of empty cells and will ask if you wish to continue. Select \"no\" to verify that the required \"Last Name\", \"First Name\", and \"Results\" columns are filled in. If all the required columns are filled in, select \"yes.\" Next, a summary will pop up with the total number of positive test results and the total number of negative test results entered. This pop up will inform you of the ratio for randomly selecting controls and the number of positive and negative records that were selected. Once you select \"yes\" the \"Entry\" sheet will be locked and no more data entry can occur. If you wish to proceed, select \"yes.\" After \"yes\" is selected, two sheets will be created: \"Final\" and \"Leftovers.\" The \"Final\" sheet will contain the selected cases and controls. These are the HCP to be invited. Depending on the case to control ratio for that week, the \"Leftovers\" Sheet may contain an additional random list of cases and/or controls. 4.4.4 Reselection of cases or controls identified after initial selection If sites are aware of a new case or control that occurred in a week for which that they have already run their initial selection macro, and there are additional cases and/or controls (\"leftovers\") that still have not been invited into the project from that same week or newly identified cases or controls that were tested that week, they can rerun the selection macro to select controls for a case or if applicable, a case for a control. It is important to save this file under a new file name that clearly indicates this is a different round of selection than the first. 11 4.4.5 Inviting to participate Site teams will invite the potentially eligible HCP selected (using the methods described in Section 4.4.3) a minimum of 14 days and up to 60 days after their test date by sending them an email with an invitation letter and a site-specific link (see Appendix B). This link will be provided by the DCC and will take the invited HCP to the main PREVENT II project REDCap Screening Form (see Section 4.5.1). The e-mail invitation should also include a link for declination (that will initiate an e-mail to the local project team and allow for invited HCP to easily indicate that they are not interested). This invitation may be sent using the site team's project specific email address or through employee health communication, but it should be a separate PREVENT II project-specific invitation email (i.e., not embedded in another email intended for other HCP announcements or communication). In most cases, sites will invite HCP to participate between 14 and 21 days after their test date. At a minimum, a site should send each HCP two e-mail invitations spread out over a week. At sites that permit telephone calls, teams are encouraged to call selected HCP to ensure that they have had the opportunity to participate. Anyone who has not responded within one week will be contacted by a site coordinator by email, telephone, text message, or other communication mode, as permissible at each site at least two more times -- a minimum of four total contact points for every invited HCP. 4.5 Screening for eligibility All HCP who are invited to the project will receive a website link that will take them to the main Project PREVENT II REDCap Screening Form. The responses they enter into the Screening form will determine whether the HCP qualifies for the project. If they qualify, they will be asked to provide their consent to participate in PREVENT II. If they provide consent and complete the baseline survey, they will be enrolled in the project. The REDCap Screening Form will ask HCP for their names, so local project staff will be able to track which HCP completed the Screening form, and which were eligible or ineligible and why. It is important for site teams to do their best to keep track of those who were invited to participate but do not complete the Screening Form, were deemed ineligible, or not enrolled and record the reason for non-enrollment if available (e.g., declined participation, ineligible and reason, admitted to hospital, unable to determine/non-responsive). 4.5.1 Screening Log A Screening Log will be maintained at each site that includes all the HCP who were selected to participate in the project. The purpose of the Screening Log is to help the site team keep track of the HCP who are selected to participate in the screening process, and to identify any issues/barriers in their recruitment procedures. The site team should record for each selected HCP the dates they were sent an invitation to participate in the project. Note that in most cases, all HCP who were selected to participate should be invited to the project, but there may be cases especially at very large hospital sites, where the project team might stagger invitations to HCP to accommodate their team's workflow. It is important especially at these sites to keep careful records of which HCP were invited and when. 12 Of those HCP who are sent an invitation to participate, the site team should record the following information on the log: a) Did HCP decline participation prior to completing the Screening form? (Yes/No) b) Did HCP complete the PREVENT II Screening Form? (Yes/No) c) Was the HCP eligible? (Yes/No) d) If eligible, did the HCP consent to participate? (Yes/No) and if Yes, record their assigned Project ID found in REDCap. The weekly facility form will ask sites to report aggregate numbers of some of the above parameters from the Screening Log every week to the DCC (Section 5.6). Sites are encouraged to maintain a list of current participants, HCP judged to be ineligible (who will not be eligible in the future), and any other HCP who would not be able to participate, or who have indicated they do not want to be contacted further. If these HCP are tested again, sites should refrain from inviting them to participate. Note that if the team is aware the HCP is hospitalized, they can still be enrolled after discharge, so should not be excluded or deemed ineligible. 4.5.2 Screening Form The site-specific invitation link will take the HCP to the REDCap screening form, which consists of questions to determine whether the HCP is eligible for participation in the project. Contact information (name) will be collected from all those screened, regardless of eligibility. This will allow the site team to track which HCP were deemed eligible/not eligible or declined participation. Only those who meet the following inclusion/exclusion criteria based on their responses to the Screening Form will be presented with the electronic informed consent form (see Section 4.6) and given the opportunity to enroll by completing the baseline survey. After completion of the Screening Form, the participant will be automatically sent an email with a link to a survey queue, which they can use to return to their record to complete surveys or upload documents. 4.5.3 Inclusion criteria Participants must meet all the following inclusion criteria: 1) Any HCP (employee or volunteer) in a participating health care system who was tested for COVID-19 (positive/negative RT-PCR, positive/negative molecular/NAAT test, or positive antigen test) in the past 60 days and after launching the project at a site; 2) HCP who have the potential for direct or indirect exposure to patients or infectious materials, including body substances, contaminated medical supplies, devices, and equipment, contaminated environmental surfaces, or contaminated air. These can include HCP of any job classification in any department of participating health care systems including staff physicians, resident physicians, advanced practice providers (PA/NP), nurses, patient care technicians/nursing assistants, pharmacists, social workers, respiratory therapists, physical therapists, clerks and administrative staff, security personnel, dieticians, cafeteria staff, environmental services/custodial staff, managers and administrators, research staff, and health sciences students (medical, nursing, pharmacy, 13 dentistry, or others, as available). Employees, students, and volunteers who meet any of the criteria above are eligible; and 3) HCP who test positive for COVID-19 must have at least one of the following symptoms during a period from 14 days prior to their first COVID-19 test to 14 days after that test: a) Abdominal pain; b) Bruised toes or feet; c) Changes in ability to smell or taste; d) Chest pain or chest tightness; e) Chills; f) Cough; g) Diarrhea; h) Fatigue (unusual feeling of tiredness); i) Fever (greater than 100\u00b0F or 37.8\u00b0C); j) Headache; k) Loss of appetite; l) Myalgia (muscle aches); m) Nausea (sick to your stomach) or vomiting; n) Rhinorrhea (runny nose); o) Rigors (sudden feeling of cold with shaking); p) Severe respiratory illness, including pneumonia; q) Shortness of breath or difficulty breathing; r) Sinus or nasal congestion; or s) Sore throat. For HCP who test negative for COVID-19, no symptoms are required for enrollment. 4.5.4 Exclusion criteria Participants must not meet any of the following exclusion criteria: 1) HCP that are unable or unwilling to confirm test results or vaccine administration using an approved method (see section 5.7); 2) Previously enrolled HCP who did not complete any follow-up surveys during a previous enrollment; 3) HCP who do not intend to be working, studying, or volunteering in the participating health care facility for at least 6 weeks after enrollment; 4) HCP who do not speak English or Spanish; and 5) HCP who work remotely from home (defined as not working at least 1 day in a healthcare facility over the last 2 weeks, as defined above). 4.5.5 Defining Index COVID test date, Index date, and Index period This section defines three terms, the Index COVID test date, the Index date, and the Index period, that will be used as reference for participants and by site teams to define the relevant time 14 points for reporting tests, vaccinations, health care utilization, and completing verifications. When completing the PREVENT II screening form, the HCP will be prompted to self-report their COVID-19 test date and whether or not they had symptoms in the two weeks prior and after their test. The REDCap will automatically determine the Index COVID test date, Index Date and Index Period based on responses provided by the HCP and will be summarized on the Project Completion Tracking Form on REDCap. The Index COVID test date is defined differently for HCP who test positive and negative. For those who test positive, it is the date of their first positive COVID-19 test in the last 60 days. For negatives, it is the date of their most recent negative COVID-19 test. The Index date is defined differently for HCP who report or do not report symptoms. To be eligible for PREVENT II, positives must also report symptoms in the two weeks before or after their test date (see Inclusion criteria #3 in Section 4.5.3). Negatives can be symptomatic or asymptomatic in that same period. If eligible and enrolled, the index date for symptomatic positives and negatives will be the date they report their symptoms started. For negatives who are asymptomatic (i.e., do not report symptoms in the two weeks prior and after their most recent COVID test) their Index date will be their Index COVID test date. 15 Finally, the Index period is defined as the time period two weeks before and two weeks after the Index date. For symptomatic participants, this will be the 14 days prior to and after the onset of their symptoms. For asymptomatic participants this will be the 14 days prior to and after their Index COVID test date. 4.5.6 Additional notes regarding eligibility Any HCP who participated in a COVID-19-related vaccine trial may be included, but detailed information about enrollment and allocation will be required. For this project, HCP who had prior COVID-19 infection >90 days before their COVID-19 index date (i.e., symptom start date for symptomatic HCP and test date for asymptomatic HCP) may be enrolled. HCP may be enrolled more than once (if the employee tested negative during a prior enrollment), but they must meet the following criteria: 1. It has been at least 6 months since their previous enrollment; 2. they must have completed all follow-up surveys from a previous enrollment; and 3. they must have had complete resolution of symptoms from the time of the first episode of testing. These questions are asked in the Screening form, so site coordinators do not need to track these criteria. Please note that project staff may participate and be enrolled in the study, but any enrolled project staff should have data verification done by another project staff member. Under no circumstances should a project team member validate his/her own records or record his/her own participation. These project staff participant enrollments should be reported to a local site PI for data integrity monitoring.

Index test (asymptomatic controls) 16 4.6 Informed consent REDCap will automatically present the informed consent document (see Appendix C) to HCP who are eligible (i.e., meet the above inclusion/exclusion criteria) based on their responses to the Screening Form. Informed consent must be obtained prior to obtaining eligible employee's records or survey. Informed consent will be completed electronically and maintained within the REDCap database managed centrally at the DCC. This consent form provides information regarding the following: 1) General project information; 2) PREVENT II project goals; 3) Expected participant obligations; 4) Participant compensation; and 5) Participant rights. Eligible HCP will have the option of selecting a decision to proceed with project participation or not. In order to provide ample time to make a decision, HCP can return to the electronic consent form at a later time using the survey queue link that was emailed to them after they completed the Screening Form. If the HCP has any questions about consent, they should contact their site PI or the site team. This will be noted in the invitation letter/email to the HCP. After confirming their participation, HCP will have the option to save a PDF and print a copy of the consent document with acknowledgement of participation (see below). HCP will provide consent by selecting \"Yes\" to the statement, \"you acknowledge that you have read the information presented, and that you agree to participate in this project.\" 4.6.1 Informed consent for interviews, proxy, or Spanish speakers If an eligible HCP prefers to complete the data collection forms by telephone, the local study coordinator may collect data using a guided interview. If the project teams learn that an invited participant has died or is unable to complete participation because of their illness, they may contact the next of kin to invite a proxy interview, if permitted by local regulation. The site coordinators will identify which employees prefer to complete the surveys via interview or proxy during recruitment activities. The site coordinator will read the consent document and if the employee is willing to participate, they will provide verbal consent to participate. This consent will be documented by site project staff on the Verbal Consent and LAR Documentation form (in REDCap) that includes a site coordinator attestation. The site coordinator can print and send a copy of the consent document to the participant or proxy, if requested. Some sites will be able to recruit employees who prefer to complete the surveys in Spanish. These will be conducted by scheduled interview with one of the Spanish-speaking site coordinators. After confirming eligibility, the site coordinator will use a Spanish version of the 17 consent form to obtain verbal consent from the participant prior to conducting the surveys. The site coordinator will enter the participant's responses directly into REDCap. 4.7 Enrollment and project ID assignment Providing informed consent and completing the baseline survey will enroll the participant in the project and REDCap will automatically assign the participant a project ID. Site teams should record the project ID on their Screening Log. The DCC will be responsible for monitoring enrollment at all sites and will communicate with sites regularly as to whether they need to make adjustments (or to stop enrolling) to ensure that enrollment is distributed appropriately across sites. 4.8 Withdrawals Reasons for withdrawal include: 1) Participant found to be ineligible after enrollment; 2) Participant requests withdrawal. The site coordinator should contact the DCC so that the record in REDCap for a participant is marked as withdrawn on the Project Completion Tracking form. 5.0 Data collection 5.1 REDCap access and reports A central PREVENT II Project REDCap database will be maintained by the DCC (through the University of Iowa Institute for Clinical and Translational Sciences) and will be used at all sites for project data collection. Access to the REDCap will be enabled for the following groups: 1) participants; 2) site investigators and project oversight staff; and 3) coordinators, project assistants, and others who are validating data elements and conducting data collection activities. All project team members who need access to REDCap must email their name, title, institution, email address, and cell phone number to emergencyidnet-prevent@uiowa.edu to obtain access to REDCap. Note that only project team members who will be regularly accessing REDCap for project activities need access. The cell phone number must be unique to a staff member as Duo authentication is required to access REDCap. The DCC will send a request to University of Iowa IT department to obtain a HawkID. This will generate an email from University of Iowa IT department to the relevant project team members. After they set up their Hawk ID, they must login to this website: https://redcap.icts.uiowa.edu/redcap/ to access REDCap. Participants will not need login credentials. If a project team member has questions about or an issue with a particular question in REDCap, the coordinator or the participant should record the item number that is below the answer response (e.g., ef4242) for that question and send an email to emergencyidnet-prevent@uiowa.edu. If a site coordinator finds an error that should be corrected in any survey, they should send an email to emergencyidnet-prevent@uiowa.edu. 18 The DCC has created several REDCap reports to help site teams keep track of project activities. Appendix F lists all the reports available to site teams, a detailed description of each, and what the site teams need to do for participants that are listed on the reports. Appendix G contains a list of REDCap alerts, including a description of all automatic email and text alerts, that have been programmed to assist with reminding participants to complete their surveys and upload their required documents. 5.2 Overview of data collection process Two possible strategies for data collection are available: 1) participant self-reported data collection using the online REDCap surveys; and 2) structured interviews (performed by telephone, zoom, or in-person) with project staff and a participant or a proxy (see sections 5.2.2 and 5.2.3). 5.2.1 Participant self-reported data collection 1) After informed consent, the data system will present the survey to collect contact information, including the participant's cell phone, and emergency contact; 2) Next, is the baseline survey (section 5.3.1). The participant has 14 days from screening to complete the baseline survey. For participants who are being tested and vaccinated at work and indicate their test results and vaccination information can be obtained through their occupational health department, the site team may request and upload the information into REDCap for the participant. But if the participant has their test results, vaccination records and/or other relevant medical records, they will be able to upload the information as a pdf, screenshot, or photograph themselves to the REDCap; 3) For situations in which medical record requests are indicated, REDCap will output data on site-specific medical record release forms and will automatically send these forms pre-filled through DocuSign by e-mail to the participants. They will electronically sign the forms and these signed forms will be available in REDCap for downloading by local project staff to initiate requests for the records; 4) At six weeks, twelve weeks, and six months after the date of their initial qualifying symptom(s) or test date (index date), participants will receive a follow-up e-mail and text message from REDCap to complete a follow-up survey (section 5.3.3). If the participant reports health care utilization 14 days prior to onset of symptoms (if symptomatic) or test date (if asymptomatic) through 14 days after their symptoms began in the follow-up survey, then a new pre-filled DocuSign medical release form will be generated and sent to the participant for electronic signature. The site teams will ensure that these records are uploaded to the system. After the follow-up surveys are completed and any relevant medical record release forms are signed by the participant, their participation will end; and 5) Any data that requires clarification or confirmation will be resolved and documented by additional electronic or telephone communication between site project staff and participants. An emergency contact will be collected from the participant at the time of project enrollment to capture information in the event of severe illness or nonresponse. 19 5.2.2 Participant Interview If HCP elect to complete an interview rather than complete surveys online, the site team will schedule an interview (telephone, video, or in-person) at a time that is convenient for both the site and the HCP. To complete the Screening form as an interview, the site coordinator will use the unique site link provided by the DCC and read the questions to the HCP on the surveys as written. Since the provided email address from the Screening form is used for all project communication including the release of information forms sent by DocuSign, the participant email must be entered into the Screening form. If the HCP is eligible, the REDCap will auto-continue to the consent document. The site coordinator should read the consent form in its entirety to the HCP. The interviewer must complete the Verbal Consent and LAR Documentation form in REDCap. This documentation is available for both the baseline and follow-up surveys. In order to complete a baseline or follow-up survey as an interview, the site coordinator can click on the 'Project Completion Tracking' form and click on the link next to 'Open survey queue.' The system will ask the site coordinator to log in by entering the participant's first name, last name, and birthdate which may be found on the screening form. Click on the link to 'Begin survey' listed next to the survey that needs to be completed. An example of what the survey queue will look like if a participant needs to complete the baseline survey is shown below. The site coordinators will enter the interview data collected from the participant interview in real-time into REDCap. If the participant reports healthcare utilization during the baseline or follow-up surveys, two additional surveys will appear in the survey queue called 'Healthcare Utilization/Verification' and 'Medical Records Requests.' These surveys are repeatable and should be completed for each non-mental health/psychiatric healthcare visit. As described above for self-reported participant data collection, the REDCap will generate and email the participant a pre-filled medical records release form for each relevant medical record. The site coordinator should remind the participant to access the form(s) in their email and provide their electronic signature via Docusign. After the form is signed, the site coordinator should ensure that all relevant medical records (i.e., test results, vaccination, and medical visits) are uploaded to REDCap. 20 5.2.3 Proxy interview A proxy interview is a method of collecting data from an individual who is not the participant. This will most commonly be performed if the participant is critically ill in the hospital (possibly related to COVID-19 or a COVID-19-like illness). If a proxy is used for an interview, the following criteria should be met: 1) The employee is physically unable to participate (due to severe illness, incapacitation, or death), and 2) The proxy would meet criteria for providing consent as a legally authorized representative for a research project, according to local regulation. In most cases, this requirement will include an individual who has durable power of attorney for health care decision-making or an appropriate first-degree family member. Under no circumstances should a proxy interview be substituted for participant data collection if the subject has the capacity to participate but chooses not to. These cases should be treated as \"decline to participate.\" 5.3 Participant Survey details After participants provide consent, the system automatically takes the participant to the Contact Information survey to enter in their cell phone number and emergency contact. After entering in this information, they are taken to their own survey queue which lists the surveys they need to complete. Participants are instructed in REDCap to save their survey queue link with the following instructions, \"In the top right-hand corner of this screen is the button 'Get link to my survey queue.' Click on this button to copy and paste or to email yourself your unique survey queue link. All future surveys will be completed through this survey queue.\" 21 If a participant decides they prefer to complete a survey at a later time, they will be able to return to the survey queue using their saved link. They will need to log into their survey queue by entering their first name, last name, and date of birth EXACTLY as it was entered on the Screening form. At the bottom of the screening survey, eligible participants are reminded of exactly what they must enter to be able to log into future surveys. If a participant forgets what they entered on the Screening form, they should contact their local site team. The local site team will be able to send the participant a link to their survey queue from their \"Project Completion Tracking\" form. 5.3.1 Baseline survey The Baseline survey should take about 15-20 minutes to complete and asks participants about their: 1) illness, including why and when they were tested for COVID, and whether they sought healthcare for their illness; 2) entire vaccination history for COVID; 3) job, including PPE use, level of patient contact, and exposure to patients with COVID; 4) exposures outside of work; 5) living situation; 6) time away from and return to work; 7) medical history; and 8) demographics. The site team should ensure that the participant completes the baseline survey as soon as possible, but no later than two weeks after screening (the baseline survey will no longer be in the survey queue after 14 days). If a participant does not want to complete the entire baseline survey at once, then they can click \"Save & Return\" and they will be given the option to send an email to themselves with the link to return to the survey at a later time. If a participant has not started their baseline survey they will receive a reminder to finish the survey at 1, 3, and 5 days from when it was originally available to the participant. It is the site's responsibility to ensure the participant completes the baseline survey. The site team can track participants who still have not completed their baseline survey 7 days after it was sent by viewing the report in REDCap called 'Baseline survey overdue.' The baseline survey will no longer be available to the participant for completion in the survey queue 14 days after screening form completion. 5.3.2 Clinical Trial Follow-up Participants who are enrolled in a vaccine clinical trial are eligible for PREVENT II if they meet all inclusion/exclusion criteria. If they do not know which trial arm they were enrolled in or whether they received a COVID vaccine at the time of enrollment, then they will be sent a monthly survey (for up to 12 months) following their enrollment into PREVENT II to ask which trial arm they were assigned to, placebo or active vaccine. Participants will be asked to upload a copy of their clinical trial assignment documentation. If they are unable to provide a copy 22 approximately 30 days after their participation in the trial ends, the site team will ask the participant for the clinical trial staff contact information to request it from them. If the participant has a copy of their vaccination card with their unblinded vaccine information, this is also acceptable for verification purposes. 5.3.3 Follow-up surveys Participants who are symptomatic, regardless of test result, will report the date they started having symptoms and participants who are asymptomatic controls will report their last negative test date on the Screening form. REDCap will send the participant an email and text message 6 weeks, 12 weeks, and 6 months, after this date (index date) with a link to their 6 week, 12 week, and 6 month follow-up surveys, respectively. For each survey timepoint, the participant will also get a reminder 2, 4, and 6 days after the initial email is sent if the participant has not yet completed the follow-up survey. It is the responsibility of the site to ensure that the participant completes all follow-up surveys within two weeks of the date it was sent. The surveys will expire 14 days after the initial links are sent, so they will not be accessible to the participants after that timepoint. The site team can track participants who still have not completed their follow-ups surveys 7 days after it was sent by viewing the reports in REDCap called 'Follow-up overdue', with a separate report for each follow-up. Please note that for participants enrolling between 42 and 60 days after the onset of symptoms (or a negative asymptomatic test), the 6-week survey will be sent to the participant immediately after completion of the baseline survey (since the 6 weeks have already elapsed at the time of enrollment). The follow-up surveys should take about 10-15 minutes to complete and asks the participant about: 1) the reasons for and results of any subsequent COVID-19 tests; 2) return to work; 3) symptoms; 4) additional vaccinations; and 5) healthcare visits. 5.4 Participant compensation Participants will be compensated $25 for completion of the Baseline survey and an additional $25 for completion of each of the follow-up surveys, whether it is completed online or by interview. If a proxy interview is done, the proxy and the participant will each receive $25. Their compensation will be sent by check to the mailing address they provide in the Contact information (or proxy) form from the University of Iowa DCC within 3 weeks after survey completion (participants can expect to receive 4 checks if they complete 4 surveys If a participant does not complete the entire survey, they will not be compensated for that survey. A participant will be compensated for a completion of a survey, even if they do not upload necessary testing and vaccine documentation. 23 5. 5 Non-compliance and lost to follow-up A participant will be considered non-compliant but will not be removed from the project if they: 1) do not complete one or more of the follow-up surveys; 2) do not allow access (i.e., do not provide consent) to release their medical records to the site team for all emergency department, urgent care, clinic or hospital visits 14 days before the onset of symptoms or index COVID-19 test date to 14 days after the onset of symptoms or index COVID-19 test date; or 3) are unable to provide appropriate documentation for their COVID-19 test result and/or their COVID-19 vaccination record. A participant is considered lost to follow-up if they consent to participate but do not complete their baseline survey. 5.6 Weekly facility form Site teams will complete the weekly facility form every week starting the week the site starts generating weekly tested lists to recruit potentially eligible HCP. Each week goes from Sunday 12:00 am thru Saturday 11:59 pm and the site team will report the start date of each week and record testing data and recruitment activities that occurred in that week only. Specifically, they will record the number of HCP that week who: 1) tested at employee health or reported testing for COVID-19; 2) tested at employee health or reported testing positive for COVID-19; 3) were added to site the Recruitment Log (these will be HCP who were tested 2 weeks prior); 4) listed on the Screening Log, i.e., selected to participate; 5) invited to participate; and 6) declined participation before completing Screening form. Since generating the Recruitment Log (#3 above), selection (#4 above), and invitation (#5 above) of participants occurs two weeks after testing, there will be at least a two-week delay between the data reported in #1 and #2 above and the rest of the data recorded. This means that for the first two weeks of the project, #3-6 will be zero. If the site team identifies a positive case outside of employee health testing lists, they should add the cases and matched controls selected from the week they were tested to the Recruitment Log and they should be included in the numbers for the week they were actually added to the Recruitment Log, even if they were tested in a prior week. There is no need to go back and adjust numbers from previous weeks, as long as numbers are not reported more than once over multiple weeks. The weekly facility form is due every Thursday of the following calendar week, to ensure timely reporting to CDC. It is important for the site team to set up a process ahead of site initiation for obtaining and entering in the above information weekly, since this information is required to be reported to CDC weekly. 24 5.7 Medical Records Abstraction The following medical records abstraction methods describe data capture and verification procedures. The purpose of these methods is to minimize bias and maximize the robustness of our data. This process is very important, since participant response alone is insufficient for reporting the primary exposures and outcomes of interest. All site team members who will be abstracting medical records must complete training and pass a short quiz prior to site launch. Site team members will not be allowed access to REDCap until they have passed the short quiz. The training video will be posted on the project website (www.prevent-project.org). Only those site team members who have been approved by the DCC to abstract medical records should perform these procedures and will be referred to in this section as \"abstractors.\" We anticipate that the number of abstractors at each site will be limited, even if a larger number of staff are involved with recruitment and participant communication. The abstractors will be responsible for ensuring that medical records of relevant tests, vaccinations and health care visits are obtained (from participant, extracted from EMR or employee health records, or requested from relevant hospital/clinic) and uploaded to REDCap. In addition, a verification form in REDCap which indicates that the abstractor has reviewed and validated the medical records must be completed by an abstractor for each COVID test record, COVID vaccination record, and health care visit record. REDCap reports and dashboards provide \"to-do\" lists for abstractors to track tests, vaccinations, and healthcare visits reported by participants that need to be requested and verified. Note that all participants must have a COVID test and vaccine record (even if not vaccinated), but not all will have sought health care for their illness during their Index period (see Section 4.5.5). If a participant has not received a COVID vaccine, a vaccine verification must be completed documenting this. Also, if the participant provides all their required medical records by uploading it into REDCap themselves, the abstractors will only need to review and verify the records by completing the relevant verification forms but will not need to go through the process of requesting those records unless they are found to be incomplete. 5.7.1 Obtaining Medical Records Each site will be responsible for creating a system to capture or request and upload medical records (including testing, vaccination, and healthcare visit utilization records) to REDCap in a timely manner. There are four ways that the site teams can obtain medical records depending on where the records are accessible and available (which will be site-dependent): 1) Participants provide records themselves (e.g., pdf, screenshot, photograph) and uploads it to the REDCap; 2) the site team receives or extracts the records from their employee health system; 3) the site team extracts the records from their EMR system; or 4) the site team requests the information from the hospital/clinic, which are typically transmitted via fax or secure email. 25 If a participant reports they want to upload documentation during their survey (see #1 above), they will be directed to complete the vaccine and/or testing verification form in their survey queue. If the site has established a plan to receive bulk reports from employee health regarding vaccine administration or testing, (see #2 above) each record still needs to be reviewed and verified by the abstractor. The entire report should not be uploaded into REDCap but should be kept available at the local site. If the participant sought care at the institution they are employed at and team members have access into their local electronic medical record (EMR) system (e.g., EPIC) based on institutional policies, team members will access the participant's records via the EMR after confirming participant completed ROI documentation (see section 5.7.1.1). If abstractors are extracting records for their own institution (see #3 above), they need to make sure that they indicate they were \"requested\" on the medical record release form even if they are just accessing the EMR for the records so they don't end up on the \"need to request\" report. In a situation where records are not available from employee health for bulk download or participant did not receive testing or vaccine administration documentation, and/or their encounters for health care visits were not at the institution of employment, records will need to be requested from all facilities the participant reported encounters with. This may include other hospitals, private practice clinics, urgent care clinics, COVID testing sites, etc. (#4 above). The abstractor will be responsible for contacting that facility to initiate the request of records. For hospital records (including inpatient admissions and ED visits), the medical records office at the hospital should be contacted during business hours via phone or email. The signed ROI form (see section 5.7.1.1) will need to be transmitted to the facility along with a fax number or email for documents to be sent to. Turnaround time is typically 1-3 business days. For clinic/private practice visits, the abstractor should contact the clinic directly and request to be transferred to appropriate contact for medical records. Send ROI forms and provide fax number or email address for records to be returned to. Note: The medical practice, clinic, or hospital website often contains contact information for requesting medical records. All documentation that contains protected health information (PHI) must be kept confidential and secure at every stage. Paper copies containing PHI will be handled and destroyed following the site's usual research policies and guidelines. All obtained records will need to be uploaded to REDCap. See specific instructions within each section below (test results, vaccine verification, health care encounters) for guidance on uploading the documentation. Any participant who provides data through an interview will still provide access to records in the same manner, and project site staff will manage the workflow of the verification process similarly. 5.7.1.1 Release of Information (ROI) form and DocuSign When a participant reports receiving COVID testing or any health care during their Index period (see Section 4.5.5) on their surveys, an electronic medical records release form will be auto-filled using the information provided by the participant. A separate release of information (ROI) form will be generated for each facility they report visiting. The forms will be pre-checked to indicate 26 which records that should be requested. If a participant does not want to share a particular record, they will have the ability to uncheck it on the ROI form, EXCEPT for the COVID test result and COVID vaccination records, which are required for participation. These auto-filled forms will be emailed to the participant for electronic signature via DocuSign. After the participant signs these forms, it will be sent back to REDCap and uploaded into the participant's record. These signed forms will be accessible by abstractors to download and print to request medical records, as necessary. 5.7.1.2 Manually initiating an ROI form If a participant indicates on their survey that they will upload their own records, the ROI form process described in the previous section is not initiated. So, if after indicating on the survey they have the records, but then are unable to find their records (e.g., they lost their vaccination card), the abstractor will ask the participant where the records could be obtained. They will need to also manually initiate a ROI form in REDCap. To do this, the site can go to the record of the participant and click on 'Medical Record Requests.' On the 'Medical Record Requests' form, the site must enter the name of the facility or provider, the medical information to be requested (e.g., COVID-19 test, emergency room visit), and the city and state of the facility/provider. The site should then click 'no' for further facility to request information from and then change the form to 'complete' and the DocuSign process will be initiated. The participant will receive an e-mail to allow for electronic signature, and the signed form will be deposited into REDCap. 5.7.1.3 Participant uploads incorrect or insufficient documentation The abstractor should be checking through all the documentation that the participant uploads to ensure that the documentation contains the information required by the project (see sections 5.7.2, 5.7.3, and 5.7.4). If they find that the participant uploaded incorrect or insufficient documentation, they will record this by checking \"No, inadequate documentation provided\" to the question \"Can this test (or record) be verified?\". When they submit the form, REDCap will ask the abstractor for a reason for changing the form. The abstractor should enter \"verification\" as the reason. 27 If they have access to the participant's EMR and an ROI has been signed by the participant, the abstractor must create a new (testing, vaccination, or health care visit) verification form, upload the appropriate source documentation form mark it as verified, by checking \"Yes\" to the question \"Can this test (or record) be verified?\" If they do not have access to the participant's EMR, then they must contact the participant and ask for the corrected source documentation. The participant can upload this information from their survey queue, which will create a new verification form, which the abstractor will complete after verifying the new source documentation is correct. Alternatively, the participant can send the source documentation to the abstractor, who can create a new verification form and upload the revised documentation and complete the form. 5.7.2 COVID-19 test results abstraction All SARS-CoV-2 or \"COVID-19\" RT-PCR, molecular/NAAT, or antigen testing test results during the Index period (see Section 4.5.5) should be obtained and recorded. In addition, the index COVID test must be obtained and recorded, even if outside of the index period. An abstractor will verify all test results (type of test/assay, date of test, result) from at least one of the following sources (a participant's self-report of a RT-PCR test result alone will be insufficient, but a self-reported home SARS-Co-V-2 antigen or molecular/NAAT test is sufficient): 1) medical record of the occupational health/employee health or health system (may include a dataset with a bulk reporting of COVID-19 test results); 2) medical record of the primary care physician or another testing center; 3) participant submitted photograph of test result or official test result report (screenshot or PDF file with test result); or 28 4) for home tests resulted at home (i.e., not sent out to a laboratory for processing), a photograph or image of the COVID-19 test box. This image does NOT need to include the test result. An abstractor will verify and attest to each result in REDCap by completing a Testing Verification Form (see Section 6.1). All participants should have a Testing Verification Form completed and verified for their index COVID test. If the participant uploaded their own documentation, a Verification Form is automatically created in REDCap. The abstractor will be able to edit this Verification form that the participant initiated to document their verification. When submitting this information, REDCap will display a pop-up asking the abstractor to supply the reason for the change to the form. The abstractor should type \"verification\" for the reason (see figure in 5.7.1.3). If medical records are obtained, then source documents will be uploaded into REDCap and a determination will be recorded (along with the identifier of the person making the determination) that the test meets the requirements of the project. If data are obtained from an employer or clinic through a bulk download process for which verification of methods have already been performed, then the project team attestation will meet the requirements verification. Multiple documents may be provided for multiple tests, and all tests performed within the Index period will be recorded. Each individual test requires completion of a separate verification form. If no source documents are provided by the participant, the abstractor MUST complete the information above the 'site verification' header. If the participant received a COVID-19 test outside the Index period, they do not need to provide documentation unless the index COVID test is outside the Index period. The abstractor does not need to verify this testing record and should mark the question on the Testing Verification form 'Was this record able to be verified?' as 'No, out of date range.' For participants who had their specimen tested at a laboratory (i.e., not resulted at home) and have source documents that provide verification, those documents must include the following: 1) an official result from a health care provider, employee health clinic, or testing center; 2) the date of the test; 3) identifying information about the organization or agency reporting the test; 4) the type of assay performed (e.g., RT-PCR). If the type of assay cannot be confirmed, the issuer may be contacted by project personnel to confirm the type of assay; and 5) the definitive test result. Samples that are positive for COVID-19 may be reported as \"Positive,\" \"Present,\" \"Detected\" or \"+.\" Any other result should be confirmed with the DCC or the issuing provider. It is preferable that the test result have a definitive identifier that links the test result with the project participant's name, but it is not required for example if the participant takes a screenshot of their test result on their MyChart app on their phone. For rapid antigen tests or molecular tests that are resulted at home, the participant must upload a picture/image of the test they used and report the result (see images below of some examples). The picture must have the company name of the test on the box. If they do not have an image of the actual box, they can provide an image downloaded from the company website or website they purchased the test from. The site team 29 should make sure the image matches a test listed on the FDA website prior to verification: https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19-emergency-use-authorizations-medical-devices/in-vitro-diagnostics-euas. Examples of Rapid Antigen Tests Examples of Molecular Tests If a participant reports they want to upload their own test records during their survey, they will be directed to complete the testing verification form in the survey queue. If the participant uploaded their own documentation, a Verification Form is automatically created. The abstractor will be able to edit this Verification form that the participant initiated to document whether they uploaded the appropriate documentation. When submitting this information, REDCap will display a pop-up asking the abstractor to supply the reason for the change to the form. The abstractor should type \"verification\" for the reason (see figure in 5.7.1.3). If the test records that the participant uploaded does not include the required information, the abstractor should record on the Test Verification Form that the records were unable to be verified due to inadequate documentation provided (i.e., select \"No, inadequate documentation provided\") and ask the participant for new documentation. When the new complete and appropriate source documentation is uploaded, it will create a new Testing Verification Form, that the abstractor can record as verified. If the participant did not report testing results, the 30 abstractor will need to create a Testing Verification Form and fill it out in its entirety, including obtaining records of the test. All participants must have a testing verification form completed for the testing date reported on their Screening form (Index covid test). If the site is unable to verify the testing date on the screening form, the testing verification form should be marked as unable to be verified (i.e., select \"No, no documentation available\"). 5.7.3 Vaccine data abstraction All COVID-19 vaccinations (all doses) received before their index COVID test will be recorded. Vaccines received after their index COVID test and reported on the 12 week and 6 month surveys will be collected from the participant by self-report, but are not required to be verified. For vaccines received prior to the index COVID test, the abstractor will verify vaccine data (i.e., date, product, manufacturer, lot number, number of doses) from at least one of the following sources (a participant's self-report of vaccine information alone will be insufficient): 1) medical record of the occupational health/employee health or health system (bulk reporting from employee health clinical will be sufficient for source verification); 2) medical record of the primary care physician or other vaccination center; or 3) state or federal vaccine registry (state Immunization Information System, Vaccine Administration Management System, or other vaccination registry). 4) Letter documenting trial arm allocation if participant was in a vaccine study An abstractor from each site will verify each vaccine record and attest to that verification within REDCap by completing a Vaccine Verification Form (see Section 6.2). All participants should have a Vaccine Verification Form completed for the COVID vaccine, whether or not they indicated they received COVID vaccine (see 5.7.3.1). If there are multiple vaccinations recorded on a single source document, the abstractor does not need to upload the same source document into each vaccine verification form if it is available on the first form. If medical records are obtained, source documents will be uploaded into REDCap and a determination will be recorded (along with the identifier of the person making the determination) that the vaccination record meets the requirements of the project. If data are obtained from an employer or clinic through a bulk download process for which verification of methods have already been performed, then the abstractor attestation will meet the requirements for verification. 31 If the participant received a COVID-19 vaccine after their index COVID test, they do not need to provide documentation. The abstractor does not need to verify this health record and should mark the question on the Vaccine verification form 'Was this record able to be verified?' as \"No, out of date range.\" If the abstractor is unable to obtain the vaccine documentation, they should mark the response \"No, no documentation available.\" For participants with source documents that provide verification, the document must include the following: 1) a definitive identifier that links it with the project participant (e.g., name); 2) the date of administration of the vaccine(s); 3) the manufacturer or product name of the vaccine administered. If a participant was vaccinated as part of a clinical trial, a letter with trial arm allocation can be used to provide source document verification. The lot number should be recorded if known, but is not required. If the lot number is unknown, please enter '9999'. If the vaccine records that the participant uploaded do not include the required information, the abstractor should note on the Vaccine Verification Form that the records was unable to be verified because inadequate documentation was provided (select \"No, inadequate documentation provided\") and ask the participant for new documentation. In addition, the abstractor can cross check missing information with bulk data sources (e.g., employee health bulk download or state registry). When the new complete and appropriate source documentation is uploaded, it will create a new Vaccine Verification Form, that the abstractor can note as verified. If a participant reports more vaccines in their baseline survey than you are able to verify through the means above, please create a vaccine verification form and click 'no, no documentation available' and add the vaccine verification date. Section 5.7.3.1 Verification of COVID non-vaccination To ensure that no COVID vaccine administrations are misreported, all sites must set up a plan to verify responses from participants who indicate they did not get a COVID vaccine. This plan will most likely involve searching the site's local employee health records and/or state vaccine registries to verify that all participants who reported they did not get a COVID vaccine during their participation in the project, did not actually receive one. To record that non-vaccination was verified, the abstractor should create a new verification form. For the question \"What is this participants vaccination status?\" they should check \"No vaccine\" and record the source of data used for verification. Every participant who responds that no vaccine has been administered will need to have this verification completed by project staff. 5.7.4 Healthcare visit records abstraction 32 If a participant has received health care during their Index period (see Section 4.5.5), the following medical records should be obtained and recorded: 1) inpatient or observation hospital admission (i.e., stayed overnight in the hospital in an inpatient room or assigned to admit team) at an acute care hospital will be included, but skilled nursing care, rehabilitation, mental health/psychiatric admissions, long-term acute care hospital admissions, or other post-acute admissions will not be included; 2) ED, urgent care, or other unscheduled clinic visits (including an evaluation in employee health, but visits for any mental health/psychiatric cause will not be included); and 3) unscheduled non-emergency episodic outpatient care visit (urgent care, walk-in clinic, etc. except for any mental health/psychiatric cause); and 4) outpatient clinic appointment (only in relation to current or recent symptoms infection). The following components of the health care record are already requested, if they are available, in the pre-filled ROI form sent to participants for electronic signature via DocuSign: 1) clinic notes, 2) emergency department (ED) visit record, 3) hospital admission notes (H&P, progress notes, consultation notes, procedure notes, discharge summary, vitals flowsheets, medication administration record), 4) radiology reports (X-ray, CT, MRI, VQ scan, ultrasound; Note: copies of the actual images are not needed), 5) lab results/reports (including microbiology and cultures), 6) vitals signs, 7) vaccination records, 8) medication lists, 9) problem list (patient summary list). An abstractor will upload these source documents into REDCap and will abstract the record using the Healthcare Utilization/Verification Form (see Section 6.3) in REDCap. These source documents must be uploaded as a single document in REDCap for each visit. This form is built as both a survey to be completed by the participant and a corresponding verification form to be completed by the site team. After the participant completes the survey, the abstractor can open the form from the participant dashboard and click on \"edit survey\" at the top of the survey. Sites are responsible for completing all components below the \"Site Verification Form\" Header. Please note that a visit for testing only (with no corresponding clinical evaluation) or telehealth appointments do not need to be reported as a health care visit. If a participant reports a healthcare encounter that should be excluded, the site team will indicate on the survey form the encounter does not need to be reviewed, e.g., \"No, out of date range\". If a participant is admitted to the hospital during their Index period (see section 4.5.5), the entire hospitalization will be abstracted even if discharge occurs after their Index period. Site coordinators will need to create a new health care utilization form for any emergency department visits associated with a hospital admission and abstract that information on a separate HCU form. For participants requiring inpatient or outpatient COVID-19 treatment, severity of illness will be confirmed through the participant medical record. 33 If the healthcare is utilized outside the date range, the abstractor should mark the question 'Does the health care visit reported by the participant meet requirements for an encounter that needs to be verified?\" as 'No, out of date range.' If the abstractor is unable to obtain the required documentation for the visit, they should mark \"No, no documentation available.\" 5.7.5 REDCap reports to track medical record abstraction The following REDCap reports (Appendix F) are available to abstractors to ensure medical record abstraction is completed: 1) Medical release request needs completed by participant The participant reported that the site would need to obtain their testing, vaccine or healthcare documentation but no medical release request was initiated by participant for a DocuSign ROI to be sent. Participant must be contacted to complete the medical record request survey. 2) Medical records to request Signed ROI received from DocuSign but no documentation of chart request 3) Medical records requested but not received Medical records requested but not received within 7 days 4) Medical records abstractions to complete Medical records have been received but have yet to be abstracted 5) Vaccine verifications to complete COVID-19 vaccine documentation uploaded by participant but not yet abstracted 6) Testing verification to complete COVID-19 testing documentation uploaded by participant but not yet abstracted 5.7.6 Communication with DCC during abstraction If team members who are abstracting medical records have questions or concerns while performing the review and abstraction, the abstractor should record the item number (e.g., ef4242) for that question and survey record id (e.g. 134) and send an email to emergencyidnet-prevent@uiowa.edu. A DCC team member will respond via email or phone call to address the concern within 2 business days. The item number can be found under the question on the survey and in the left-hand column of the table with instructions for each survey question. The record ID is found on the report page in the left-hand column. 34 If the DCC needs to contact abstractors or specific reviewers regarding concerns or questions, an email will be sent to the abstractor followed by phone call if there has not been a response within 2 business days. 6.0 REDCap form-specific instructions 6.1 Test record verification Specific instructions for testing verification form (to be done by abstractors) are detailed in the table below.

The DCC set up several REDCap Reports (see Appendix F) for site teams to track participant survey completion and other project task activities, including completion of verifications and medical records release form completion. Any element of the protocol is considered 'overdue' if it has been 7 days since the survey or medical release was sent to the participant or for uploads 7 days since the participant completed the survey. These reports have also been built as dashboards within REDCap. The DCC has also set up methods to identify data that is out of range for testing or health care utilization, i.e., if a participant reports testing or healthcare utilization outside of 14 days before to 14 days after the index date, these data will appear in the following REDCap reports: It is the site team's responsibility to follow-up with participants to ensure the dates entered by the participant are correct and updated if necessary. Finally, the DCC will send out queries (every two weeks or monthly) to sites listing all outstanding data verifications, inconsistent data to check, and other project tasks. 7.1 Recruitment and screening log completion 51 It is essential for sites to keep a careful Recruitment List and Screening Log throughout the entire project. Prior to study launch, each site should test their process of recording this information to ensure that the information is obtainable and organized appropriately. The CCC may request de-identified copies of the Recruitment List or Screening Logs from sites especially at the early stages of recruitment to track and identify any errors or issues. 7.2 Tracking recruitment rates Site weekly recruitment rates will be monitored weekly by the CCC and DCC. It is essential for sites to set up a process to determine the recruitment rates and test this process prior to launch. If the site recruitment rates are less than 50% after the first two weeks of inviting participants, the site team will meet with the CCC to discuss strategies to increase their rates. 7.3 Weekly Facility Form completion Site teams will complete weekly facility forms for the previous week. It is important for this information to be completed weekly for regular reporting to CDC. If site teams are unable to submit data by Thursday for the previous week, the CCC will schedule a meeting to discuss strategies to ensure timely completion moving forward. 7.4 Medical records collection and verification 7.5.1 Abstractor training All site team members who will be abstracting medical records must complete training and be approved to abstract prior to site launch. Training will initially occur via an all-site meeting and the video will be posted at www.prevent-project.org. After the training session, team members will complete a short quiz to ensure competence. This short quiz will include a mock patient file and will include test results, vaccine information and records from a health care encounter. The abstractor will be given approximately one week to complete the test and submit their answers to the DCC. If the abstractor does not pass the quiz, they will receive individual feedback on the incorrect answers and will be provided with a second mock file and quiz. If the second quiz is not passed, the data abstractor will not be approved, and the site will need to select a replacement who will undergo the same training and testing. Sites will not be released to do medical record abstraction until at least one team member has passed training. The training will be recorded, and a video will be posted on the project website (www.project-prevent.org) for team members to review as needed. Site teams will need to obtain and verify test results, vaccine results, and healthcare visit records per the procedures detailed in Section 5.7. A member of the DCC team will randomly select multiple records per site each week to verify the information recorded is correct. If there are discrepancies, the DCC team member will contact the abstractor to discuss. The DCC will also track the collection and verification of this information regularly, and if a site is missing large amounts of information or is not collecting information in a timely manner, they will contact the site team to discuss further.

PREVENT flyer/poster examples 54 55 Appendix B. PREVENT II Project Invitation E-mail example Subject Heading: CDC- funded surveillance Project PREVENT Invitation <Institutional Letterhead> Dear <Institution> Employee, The <Institution> is partnering with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to conduct Project PREVENT. Project PREVENT (PReventing Emerging Infections Through Vaccine EffectiveNess Testing) is evaluating the effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines and its impact on health care providers. You were recently tested for COVID-19 and may be able to participate in this important project. Your participation in this project is voluntary and choosing to participate or not participate will not impact your employment or standing with <Institution>. If you are interested in learning more about the project, please click on the following link: <Link to local REDCap> The link will take you to a screening page to see if you meet the criteria to participate in this project. If you meet the screening criteria then you will be invited into the project and asked to complete four online surveys. You will be paid $25 by the PREVENT Project Team after completing each of the four surveys for a total of $100. The checks will be mailed to you by the project coordinating center. You will not be given any vaccines or other medications as part of this project. Being vaccinated is not a requirement for participating. No information about you has been given to the project team. The initial results from this project which currently includes over 10,000 U.S. health care workers have been published in the New England Journal of Medicine ( NEJM Link ) For more information, please visit w ww.prevent-project.org. If you have any questions about the project, please contact the <Institution> project team members at <Insert contact info of site team> Sincerely, <Site PI> 56 Appendix C. Informed Consent document Preventing Emerging Infections through Vaccine Effectiveness Testing (Project PREVENT II) Informed Consent You are being asked to participate in this project, called PREVENT II, because you work in a medical center or health system and you were recently tested for COVID-19. With support from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), investigators at the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA and the University of Iowa College of Medicine are conducting surveillance at this and other U.S. hospitals to measure the effectiveness of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine boosters in preventing COVID-19 and reducing the severity and duration of illness among health care workers. We are also measuring how COVID-19 impacts returning to work activities, how long SARS-CoV-2 vaccines protect against infection and long term symptoms. You may participate whether or not you have received the COVID-19 vaccine, and you will not receive any vaccination as part of this project. If you choose to participate, you will complete an initial survey with questions about you, why you were tested, your job, COVID-19 exposure, symptoms, and medical care. You will then complete follow-up surveys at approximately 4 weeks, 12 weeks, and 6 months from now with questions about your illness and your recovery (3 follow-up surveys in total). To compensate you for your time, you will receive $25 for each survey completed ($100 total for completing all surveys). You will receive a check after each completed survey. The first survey will take about 20 minutes to complete and each follow-up survey will take about 10-15 minutes to complete. Some participants will complete their project activities using computerized surveys, and others will complete project activities through interviews. We will also ask you or your employee health/occupational health clinic and any other health care providers you visited to provide documentation of the following: 1. Results of any recent COVID-19 testing; 2. SARS-CoV-2 Vaccination records (vaccine administration will be confirmed with employee health/occupational health records or vaccine registries regardless of vaccine status); and 3. Medical records for care related to your current/recent illness. We will use medical records, hospitalizations, emergency department visits or unscheduled walk-in/urgent care clinic visits, and illness-related clinic visits to help us know how sick you became after your COVID-19 testing. Your data will be protected. It will be maintained in a secure database that is only accessible to the project team. After we have completed data analysis, we will remove your personal identifying information from all project documents. Only de-identified data will be shared with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. None of your responses will be shared with your employer. The results of this project will be published, but your name or any other personal identifying information will not appear in any reports, databases, or publications. Your participation is completely voluntary and there is no penalty for declining to participate. 57 Are you willing to participate in this study? \u0000 Yes \u0000 No 58 Appendix D.
