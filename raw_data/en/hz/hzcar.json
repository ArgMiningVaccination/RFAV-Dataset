MICHELLE LUJAN GRISHAM, officially and individually, acting under the color of law, et al., Defendants - Appellees. No. 21-21 05 (D.C. No. 1:21-CV -00783-MV-JHR) (D. N.M.) ORDER _________________________________ Before HARTZ and MATHESON, Circuit Judges. _________________________________ This matter comes before the court on Appellants' motion for an injunction seeking to prohibit New Mexico officials from enforcing a COVID-19 vaccine mandate that applies to certain healthcare workers and State Fair attendees pending this interlocutory appeal of the district court's denial of such relief. Appellants also seek a stay of the district-court proceedings. In considering \"a request for a stay or an injunction pending appeal,\" we \"make[] the same inquiry as [we] would when reviewing a district court's grant or denial of a preliminary injunction. \" Homans v. City of Albuquerque, 264 F.3d 1240, 1243 (10th Cir. 2001). To succeed on a typical preliminary-injunction motion, the moving party needs to prove four things: (1) that she's substantially likely to succeed on FILED United States Court of Appeals Tenth Circuit December 15, 2021 C hristopher M. Wolpert Clerk merits, (2) that she'll suffer irreparable injury if the court denies the injunction; (3) that her threatened injury (without the injunction) outweighs the opposing party's under the injunction, and (4) that the injunction isn't adverse to the public interest. Mrs. Fields Franchising, LLC v. MFGPC, 941 F.3d 1221, 1232 (10th Cir. 2019) (internal quotation marks omitted); see also 10th Cir. R. 8.1. If a movant fails to establish a likelihood of success on the merits, the court can deny the motion. See, e.g., Warner v. Gross, 776 F.3d 721, 736 (10th Cir. 2015) (finding \"it unnecessary to address the remaining requirements for a preliminary injunction\" where the \"plaintiffs failed to establish a significant possibility of success on the merits\" and denying an emergency motion for stay of execution pending appeal for the same reason). To show a likelihood of success in their interlocutory appeal, Appellants must show a likelihood this court will hold that the district court abused its discretion by denying their motion for a preliminary injunction. See First W. Cap. Mgmt. Co. v. Malamed, 874 F.3d 1136, 1140 (10th Cir. 2017). The district court based its denial in part on its conclusion that Appellants were unlikely to succeed in their suit challenging the vaccine mandate. Among other things, we do not find persuasive the arguments Appellants advance to challenge this conclusion. At the outset, we note that Plaintiff-Appellant Valdez concedes that her claims for injunctive relief are moot because the State Fair is over. Plaintiff-Appellant healthcare worker Blackford argues the district court erred by finding she is unlikely to succeed on the merits of her substantive-due-process, equal-protection, Contracts Clause, and New Mexico Constitution substantive-due-process claim rests on her argument that the vaccine mandate infringes her rights to occupational choice and bodily integrity. Blackford argues that these are fundamental rights, triggering heightened scrutiny of the vaccine mandate. But the district court relied on Tenth Circuit precedent holding that the \"right to practice in [one's] chosen profession . . . F.3d 1101, 1118 (10th Cir. 2012), and Blackford does not address this precedent or otherwise explain how the district court abused its discretion by relying on it and concluding rational-basis review applies here. As for Blackford's bodily-integrity argument, it was inadequately presented to the district court. Her pleadings submitted to the district court before it denied her request for preliminary injunction present her bodily-integrity claim only as a Fourth Amendment claim and without any explanation (or even citing authority that presented an explanation) of how the Fourth Amendment would apply in this context. Thus the bodily-integrity claim was forfeited below. See Somerlott v. Cherokee Nation Distribs., Inc., 686 F.3d 1144, 1151 (10th Cir. 2012). \"Under rational basis review, we will uphold a law if there is any reasonably conceivable state of facts that could provide a rational basis for the infringement.\" Maehr v. U.S. Dep't of State, 5 F.4th 1100, 1122 (10th Cir. 2021) (brackets and internal quotation marks omitted). \"This requires no more than a ' reasonable fit' between governmental purpose and the means chosen to advance that purpose.\" Id. (ellipsis and internal quotation marks does not point to evidence undermining the district court's conclusion that there is a rational connection between the vaccine mandate and the \"compelling\" state interest in \"[s]temming the spread of COVID-19,\" Roman Cath. Diocese of Brooklyn v. Cuomo , 141 S. Ct. 63, 67 (2020). Yet she would have to in order to prevail on her substantive-due-process claim under rational-basis review. See, e.g., Maehr, 5 F.4th at 1122 (\"Our rational basis review is highly deferential toward the government's actions, and the burden is on the plaintiff to show the governmental act complained of does not further a legitimate state purpose by rational means.\" (brackets and internal quotation marks omitted)). On equal protection, Blackford does not contest the district court's finding that the vaccine mandate does not target a suspect class. Blackford's equal -protection claim will therefore proceed under rational-basis review, see Rector v. City & Cnty. of Denver, 348 F.3d 935, 949 (10th Cir. 2003), dooming her argument that the district court abused its discretion for the reasons discussed above. On Blackford's Contracts Clause claim, the district court concluded she failed to establish a substantial impairment of any contractual relationship in part because she did not provide the district court with copies of the purported contract at issue or cite to any provisions therein to show that the mandate undermines her contractual bargain. Blackford does not argue the district court erred in reaching this conclusion. Blackford similarly fails to challenge the district court's conclusion that the Eleventh Amendment bars her from bringing her New Mexico Constitution claims in federal court, nor has she shown that the New Mexico Constitution provides her with more protection than the Appellate Case: 21-2105 -United Sta tes Constitution in this context. She is therefore unlikely to show that the district court abused its discretion in finding she is unlikely to succeed on those claims in her federal suit. See United States v. Leffler, 942 F.3d 1192, 1196 (10th Cir. 2019). We conclude that Appellants have failed to show that an injunction pending appeal or a stay of the district-court proceedings is warranted in this case. Our conclusion comports with holdings from the Supreme Court and other circuits in similar circumstances. See, e.g., We The Patriots USA v. Hochul , No. 21A125, --- S. 13, Mills, 142 S. Ct. 17 (2021); Klaassen v. Trs. of Ind. Univ., 7 F.4th 592 (7th Cir. 2021); We The Patriots, 17 F.4th 266; Does 1-6 v. Mills, 16 F.4th 20 (1st Cir. 2021). Therefore, Appellants' motion is denied. Entered for the Court CHRISTOPHER M. WOLPERT, Clerk Appellate -1 IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE DISTRICT OF NEW MEXICO TALISHA VALDEZ, on behalf of herself and others similarly situated, and JENNIFER BLACKFORD, on behalf of herself and others similarly situated, Plaintiffs, Case No. 21-cv-783 MV/JHR vs. MICHELLE LUJAN GRISHAM, Officially and Individually, Ac ting Under the Color of Law, and DAVID SCRASE, Officially and Individually, Ac ting Under the Color of Law, Defendants. MEMORANDUM OPINION AND ORDER THIS MATTER comes before the Court on Plaintiffs' Verified Class Action Complaint for Civil Rights Violations Under 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1983; Violations of Ri ghts Protected by the New Mexico Civil Rights Act; Emergency Request for a Temporary Restra ining Order; Request for Preliminary Injunction, Permanent Injunctive Relief and Damages (the \"Complaint\") [Doc. 1]. The Court, having considered the Complaint and the relevant law, finds that Plaintiffs' requests for a temporary restrain ing order and a preliminary inj unction are not well-taken and will be denied. BACKGROUND Since its emergence last year , the novel coronavirus 2019, or Sars-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, has spread exponentially thro ugh the world, and New Mexico has been no exception. Doc. 13 at 3. The ease and rapidity with which COVID-19 spreads and its potentially Case 1:21-cv-00783-MV-JHR Document 18 Filed 09/13/21 Page 1 of 30 -App. 6 -2 severe symptoms create a frightening potential for mass deaths and an overloaded healthcare system. Id. at 4. During the winter of 2020-21, the United States averaged nearly 200,000 new cases and 4,000 COVID-19-rela ted deaths every day. Id. at 4-5. One in fi ve New Mexicans who were hospitalized for COVID-19 passed away. Id. at 5. In February 2020, the United States Department of Health and Human Services (\"HHS\") declared a public emergency and instructed the United States Food and Drug Administration (\"FDA\") to grant emergency use authoriza tions (\"EUA\") for \"medical devices and interventions\" to combat the pandemic, including vaccines. Id. at 6. The FDA issued detailed guidance to vaccine manufacturers, requiring a determination that the vaccine's benefits outweigh its risks based on data from at least one well-designed Phase 3 clinical trial that demonstrates the vaccine's safety and e fficacy in a clear and compelling manner. Id. Three vaccine candidates emerged as front runners: Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna's two-dose mRNA vaccines, and Johnson & Johnson's (\"J&J\") single-dose viral vector vaccine. Id. By the time Pfizer, Moderna, and J&J appl ied for EUA status (w hich, for Pfizer and Moderna, was in November 2020, and for J&J, was in February 2021), each vaccine had undergone significant testing. Id. at 6-7. After a t eam of representatives from across the FDA reviewed the data submitted by each manufacturer and independently assessed the risks and benefits of the vaccines, the FDA granted EUA, for individuals 16 and older, to Pfizer and Moderna's vaccines in December 2020 and to J&J' s vaccine in February 2021, noting that each had met the expectations set out in the FDA's comprehensive guidance. Id. at 7. Pfizer's vaccine later received EUA for individuals 12 and older, and on August 23, 2021, received full FDA approval for individuals 16 and older. Id. at 8. Case 1:21-cv-00783-MV-JHR Document 18 Filed 09/13/21 Page 2 of 30 -App. 7 -3 Since the three vaccines received EUA status, over 368 million doses have been administered and over 173 million Ameri cans have been fully vaccinated. Id. Comprehensive data collected since the three vaccines received EUA status demonstrates that they are safe and highly effective in preventing infection and severe illness, and that serious adverse side effects from the vaccines are exceedingly rare. Id. at 8-9. Further, the immunity provided by the vaccines is significantly more robust than na tural immunity gained following infection. Id. at 9. In late 2020, the \"Del ta\" variant, a highly in fectious and possibly more deadly strain of the coronavirus, appeared in India; by mid-J une of 2021, the Centers fo r Disease Control and Prevention (\"CDC\") had labeled it a \"variant of concern.\" Id. The Delta variant now accounts for virtually all new infections in the United Stat es - including in New Mexico - and is believed to be twice as contagious as previous variants. Id. Studies indicate that individuals infected with the Delta variant are more likely to be hospitali zed than those infected with other strains. Id. While the Delta variant is more lik ely to cause \"breakthrough\" infe ctions than other variants, the vaccines still provide strong prot ection against serious illness and death in individuals who contract the Delta variant. Id. at 10. Although case rates in New Mexico had be gun to drop dramatically, the numbers rose rapidly with the rise of the Delta variant. Id. at 11. Back in June, there were approximately 60 new cases a day but by mid-August, there were nearly 900 new cases a day - a fifteenfold increase. Id. As a result, hospitals are again opera ting over their capacity to accommodate the surge of infected New Mexicans, the ma jority of whom are not vaccinated. Id. To stem the tide of new cases and ease the pressure on our ho spitals, on August 17, 2021, New Mexico Department of Health Acting Secr etary David R. Scrase, M.D., issued \"Public Health Emergency Order Requiring All School Workers Comply with Certain Health Case 1:21-cv-00783-MV-JHR Document 18 Filed 09/13/21 Page 3 of 30 -App. 8 -4 Requirements and Requiring Congregate Care Fa cility Workers, Ho spital Workers, and Employees of the Office of the Governor Be Fu lly Vaccinated\" (the \"PHO\"). Doc. 1-2. In relevant part, the PHO requires a ll \"hospital workers . . . to be fully vaccinated against COVID- 19 unless they qualify for an exemption.\" Id. at 3-4. The PHO also requires that \"[a]ll persons who are eligible to receive a COVID-19 vaccine and enter the gr ounds of the New Mexico State Fair . . . provide adequate proof of being fully vaccinated against COVID-19 . . . unless the individual qualifies for an exemption.\" Id. at 5. Both hospital worker s and individuals who seek entry into the State Fair \"may be exempt from the COVID-19 vacci nation requirement . . . if they have a qualifying medical condition which immuni zation would endanger their health, or they are entitled . . . to a disability-related reasona ble accommodation or a sincerely held religious belief accommodation.\" Id. at 4, 5-6. A religious belief exemption may be supported by \"a statement regarding the manner in which the ad ministration of a COVID-19 vaccine conflicts with the religious observance, practice , or belief of the individual.\" Id. at 4-5, 6. The PHO specifically indicates that the vaccine requirements se t forth therein are ba sed on the following scientific and medical evidence: \"the currently available COVID-19 vaccines are safe and the most effective way of preventi ng infection, serious illness, and death\"; \"widespread vaccination protects New Mexico's health car e system as vaccines decrease the need for emergency services and hospitalization\"; and \"the refusal to recei ve the COVID-19 vaccine not only endangers the individual but the entire commu nity, and further jeopardizes th e progress the State has made against the pandemic by allowing the virus to transmit more freely and mutate into more transmissible or deadly va riants.\" Doc. 1-2. On August 19, 2021, Plaintiffs co mmenced the instant action. Named Plaintiff Jennifer Blackford is a registered nurse employed by Presbyterian. Doc. 1- 3 \u00b6 2. She asserts that the Case 1:21-cv-00783-MV-JHR Document 18 Filed 09/13/21 Page 4 of 30 -App. 9 -5 PHO \"requires that [she] be terminated if [she] refuse[s] to be vaccinated for COVID-19,\" and that, based on her \"medical training and her ow n independent research,\" she is \"opposed to receiving the EUA covid vaccines.\" Id. \u00b6\u00b6 4-5. Named Plaintiff Ta lisha Valdez, on behalf of herself and her 11- and 12-year-old daughters, has contracted to e xhibit their animals at the New Mexico State Fair. Doc. 1-4 \u00b6\u00b6 2, 6. She asserts that the PHO \"prohibits [her] and [her] children from attending the New Mexico State Fair and showing their animals,\" and that she has chosen \"not to be vaccinated\" and \"to refuse to have [her] child injected with an experimental EUA vaccine.\" Id. at \u00b6\u00b6 9, 12. Together, Plaintiffs allege that, unless this Court enters a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction, under the PHO, \"New Mexicans will be forced to take an experimental vaccine in order to retain their employment and will forever lose the ability to exhibit their unique animals at the New Mexico State Fair.\" Do c. 1 at 22. In their Complaint, Plaintiffs request \"a temporary restraining order to prohibit Defendants from enforcing public health orders against the Plaintiffs and other putative class member s that are similarly situated,\" and a preliminary injunction \"to prohibit Defendants from enforci ng public health orders in the arbitrary and capricious manner and fashion engaged by Defendants.\" Id. at 15. In an Order entered on August 23, 2021, the Court denied Plaintiffs' re quest for entry of an emergency order on an ex parte basis, explaining that Plaintiffs did not meet the requirements of Rule 65(b)(1) of the Federal Rules of Civil Pr ocedure that would entitl e them to a temporary restraining order \"without written or oral notice to the adverse party or its attorney.\" Doc. 3. The Court, however, set an expedited briefing schedule on Plaintiffs' re quest for preliminary relief. Id. Later that day, Plaintiffs filed a motion asking the Court to rec onsider its decision. Doc. 4. In an Order entered on August 25, 20121, the Court denied Plaintiffs' motion, explaining that Plaintiffs provi ded no basis for the Court to use its inherent authority to Case 1:21-cv-00783-MV-JHR Document 18 Filed 09/13/21 Page 5 of 30 -App. 10 -6 reconsider its decision to refr ain from issuing an order enjo ining enforcement of the PHO without providing Defendants with an opportunity to respond. Doc. 10. In accordance with the expedited briefing schedule set by the Court, Defendants filed a response in opposition on August 30, 2021, Doc. 13, and Plaintiffs' reply followed on September 1, 2021. Doc. 14. STANDARD \"A preliminary injunction is an extraordinary remedy, the excep tion rather than the rule.\" Free the Nipple-Fort Collins v. City of Fort Collins, Colo. , 916 F.3d 792, 797 (10th Cir. 2019). To obtain a \"typical\" preliminar y injunction, the moving party must prove four things: (1) \"that she's substantially likely to succeed on the merits\"; (2) \"that she'll suffer irreparable injury if the court denies the injunction\"; (3 ) \"that her threat ened injury (without th e injunction) outweighs the opposing party's under the inju nction\"; and (4) \"that the injunction isn't adverse to the public interest.\" Id. (citation omitted).1 \"The third and fourth fact ors 'merge' when, like here, the government is the opposing party.\" Aposhian v. Barr , 958 F.3d 969, 978 (10th Cir. 2021) (quoting Nken v. Holder , 556 U.S. 418, 435 (2009)). \"[B]ecaus e a preliminary injunction is an extraordinary remedy, the [movant 's] right to relief must be clear and unequivocal.\" Id. (quoting Dominion Video Satellite, Inc. v. Echostar Satellite Corp. , 356 F.3d 1256, 1261 (10th Cir. 2004) (internal quotation marks omitted )). Notably, the movant \"must\" satisfy her burden as to each element; the elements \"do not establish a balanci ng test - each must be satisfied independently, 1 As noted above, Plaintiffs request both a temporary restra ining order and a preliminary injunction. Where, as here, ther e has been notice to the adverse party, a motion for a temporary restraining order \"may be treated by the cour t as a motion for preliminary injunction.\" 13 Moore's Federal Practice \u00a7 65.31 (2920). Further, the standard applicable to a motion for a preliminary injunction is the same as that app licable to a motion for a temporary restraining order. Firebird Structures, LLC v. United Bhd. of Carpenters & Joiners of Am., Local Union No. 1505, 252 F. Supp. 3d 1132, 1156 (D.N.M. 2017). Accord ingly, the Court analyzes Plaintiffs' requests for temporary and preliminary relief togeth er as a request for a preliminary injunction. Case 1:21-cv-00783-MV-JHR Document 18 Filed 09/13/21 Page 6 of 30 -App. 11 -7 and the strength of one cannot compen sate for the weakne ss of another.\" Citizens Against Our Env't v. Jewell, 839 F. 3d 1276, 1282 (10th Cir. 2016)). Courts, however, \"'disfavor' some preliminar y injunctions and so require more of the parties who request them.\" Free the Nipple , 916 F.3d at 797 relative posit ions exhibit any of three charac teristics\": (1) \"it mandates action (rather than prohibiting it)\"; (2) \"it changes the status quo\"; or (3) \"it grants all the relief that the m oving party could expect from a trial win.\" Free the Nipple , 916 F.3d at 797. To obtain a \"disfavored\" preliminary injunction, the moving party \"faces a heavier bur den on the likelihood-of-success-on-the merits and the balance-of-harms factors, \" namely, she must make a \"strong showing that these tilt in her favor.\" Id. (citation omitted). DISCUSSION Defendants argue that the in junction Plaintiffs seek, na mely, \"to prohibit Defendants from enforcing public health orders,\" is disfavored for two reasons: (1) Plaintiffs seek the same injunctive relief sought in their Complaint, and thus \"seek virt ually all the relief they could be awarded at the end of trial on the merits\"; and (2) an injunc tion would \"force Defendants to affirmatively alter the PHO and the State's enforcement of it,\" thus changing the status quo. Doc. 13 at 15-16. The Court is inclined to agree that the requested pr eliminary injunction is disfavored. See Peterson , 492 F. Supp. 3d at 1193 (finding th at the requested preliminary injunction, namely, requiring defenda nts to allow private schools to conduct in-person learning at 50% capacity, was disfavored because it would change the status quo set by the challenged Case 1:21-cv-00783-MV-JHR Document 18 Filed 09/13/21 Page 7 of 30 -App. 12 -8 public health order, which imposed a 25% capacity limitation on private schools, and because the requested preliminary relief was \"an exact overlay of relief sought \" in plaintiffs ' complaint). The Court, however, need not decide whether the heightened disfavor ed-injunction standard applies, thus requiring \"strong\" s howings from Plaintiffs on the fi rst and third factors, because, as set forth herein, Plaintiffs fail to make even the baseline showing on any of the four factors as required to obtain a \"typical\" injunction. I. Likelihood of Success on the Merits In their Complaint, Plaintiffs assert that the PHO's vaccine requirements violate the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (\"FDCA\"), their Fourteenth Amen dment rights to equal protection, substantive due process, and procedur al due process, their rights under Article 1, Section 10 of the United States Constitution, and their rights under the New Mexico Constitution. Doc. 1 at 9-14. Plaintiffs, however, have failed to establish that any of these claims are likely to succeed on the merits. A. FDCA Claims According to Plaintiffs, by mandating that certain individuals be vaccinated against COVID-19, the PHO violates the FDCA, because the provisions of the FDCA relevant to medical products under an EUA \"state[] that wh ere a medical product is 'unapproved' then no one may be mandated to take it.\" Doc. 1 \u00b6 54 (quoting 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 360bbb-3(e)). As an initial matter, and despite Plaintiffs' protestation to the contrary, the FDA has now given its full approval - not just emergency us e authorization - to the Pfizer vaccine as administered to individuals 16 years of age and older. See FDA News Release, https://www.fda.gov/emergency- preparedness-and-response/coronavirus-diseas e-2019-covid-19/comirnaty-and-pfizer-biontech- covid-19-vaccine (\"On August 23, 2021, the FDA approved the first COVID-19 vaccine. The Case 1:21-cv-00783-MV-JHR Document 18 Filed 09/13/21 Page 8 of 30 -App. 13 -9 vaccine has been known as the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine, and will now be marketed as Comirnaty , for the prevention of COVID-19 disease in individuals 16 years of age and older.\"). Accordingly, the provisions of the FDCA quoted by Plaintiff, which are applicable only to medical products under an EUA, are not a pplicable to the admini stration of the Pfizer vaccine to individuals 16 years of age and older. Further, while the statutory pr ovisions quoted by Plaintiffs ap ply to the Moderna vaccine, the J&J vaccine, and the Pfizer vaccine as administered to individuals under the age of 16, those provisions nowhere prevent the stat e, or any other entity, from requi ring certain individuals to be vaccinated against COVID-19. Rather, in releva nt part, the FDCA requires that, for medical products under an EUA, \"HHS must establish co nditions to facilitate informed (7th Cir. 2021) (citing 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 360bbb-3(e)(1)(A)(ii)). Specifically, \" HHS must ensure that individuals taking the vaccine are informed that the Se cretary has authorized the emerge ncy use of the product,\" \"of the significant known and potential benefits and risks of such use, and of the extent to which such benefits and risks are unknown,\" and \"of the op tion to accept or refuse administration of the product, of the consequences, if any, of refusing admin istration of the pr oduct, and of the alternatives to the product that are ava ilable and of their be nefits I , at are not \"directly administering the va ccine\" to hospital workers and individuals who seek entry into the State Fair; instead, they ar e requiring such individuals \"to obtain the vaccine from a medical provider and to attest that th ey have been vaccinated, save for certain Case 1:21-cv-00783-MV-JHR Document 18 Filed 09/13/21 Page 9 of 30 -App. 14 -10 exemptions.\" Id. The individuals \"will be informed of the risks and benefits of the vaccine and of the option to accept or refuse the vaccine by their medical providers.\" Id. Accordingly, to the extent that the vaccine s at issue here remain subject to the EUA provisions of the FDCA, the PHO does not run afoul of those provisions. Id.; see also Bridges v. Hous. Methodist 12, (rejecting hospital employee's clai m, virtually identical to Plaintiffs' claim here, that under FDCA \"no one can be mandated to receive 'unapp roved' medicines in emergencies,\" noting that the FDCA \"confers certain power s and responsibilities to the Secretary of Health and Human Services in an emergency,\" \"n either expands nor restricts th e responsibilities of private employers,\" and \"does not conf er a private opportunity to sue the government\"); Dep't of Justice, Whether Section 564 of the Food, Drug and Co smetic Act Prohibi ts Entities from Requiring the Use of a Vaccine Subject to an Emergency Use Authorization at 2 (July 6, 2021), https://www.justice.gov/olc/file/1415446/download (finding that informed consent provision in FDCA \"specifies only that certain information be provided to potential vaccine recipients and does not prohibit entities from impos ing vaccination requirements\"). It follows that Plaintiffs are unlikely to succeed on the merits of their FDCA claims. B. Substantive Due Process Claims Plaintiffs generally allege that they \"have [constitutionally] protected liberty interests\" \"in their right to live without governmental interference,\" their ri ght \"to bodily integrity,\" their right \"to raise their children as they see fit, \" and their right \"to e ngage in their chosen professions,\" and that because the PHO is \"not narrowly tailored,\" it violates these substantive due process rights. Doc. 1 \u00b6\u00b6 63, 65. Here, \"plaintiffs advance a s ubstantive due process challenge to a legislative enactment,\" namely, the PHO. Dias v. City & Cty. of Denver , 567 F.3d Case 1:21-cv-00783-MV-JHR Document 18 Filed 09/13/21 Page 10 of 30 -App. 15 -11 1169, 1182 (10th Cir. 2009) (emphasis in original); see also ETP Rio Rancho Park, LLC, v. \"[although the NMDOH - a state executive agency\" - issued the challenged PHO, that PHO was \"akin to a legislative action\"). Accordingly, a \"two-part substantive due process framework is applicable.\" Dias , 567 F.3d at 2021 765364, two-part approach to park ow ners' substantive due process challenge to PHO that limited operations for recreational facilities) . First, the Court must \"carefully describe the asserted fundamental liberty interest.\" Dias , 567 F.3d at 1182 (citation omitted). Second, the Cour t must decide \"whether that inte rest is 'deeply rooted in this Nation's history and tradition' and 'implicit in th e concept of ordered liberty, such that neither liberty nor justice would exist if they were sacrificed.'\" Id. (quoting Washington v. Glucksberg, 521 U.S. 702, 720-21 (1997)). If the Court determines that the rights asse rted are fundamental, the Fourteenth Amendment \"forbids the government to infringe [thos e] rights at all, . . . unless the infringement is narrowly tailored to serve a compelling state interest.\" Glucksberg , 521 U.S. at 721. If the legislative (or executive) action at issue \"does not implicate a fundamental right, it must nonetheless bear a rationa l relationship to a legitimate government interest.\" Dias , 567 F.3d at 1182 (citation omitted). Here, Plaintiffs' assertion of broadly defined rights falls short of providing the \"careful description of the assert ed fundamental liberty interest\" required under Glucksberg to establish a fundamental right . ETP Rio Rancho Park, 2021 WL 765364, at * 42. Plaintiffs do not explain how the rights allegedly violated by the PHO are fundamental ; indeed nowhere, do they address how the right to work in a hospital or attend th e State Fair, unvaccinate d and during a pandemic, is \"deeply rooted in this Na tion's history and tradition.\" Id. Case 1:21-cv-00783-MV-JHR Document 18 Filed 09/13/21 Page 11 of 30 -App. 16 -12 In support of their request for preliminary reli ef, Plaintiffs focus solely on the right to \"engage in their chosen professi on,\" which they contend \"is deeply rooted in our nation's legal and cultural history and has long been recognized as a component of the liberties protected by the Fourteenth Amendment.\" Doc. 14 at 6. Bu t the Tenth Circuit has unequivocally held that the \"right to practice in [one's ] chosen profession . . . does liberty component of the Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process Clause includes some genera lized due process right to choose one's field of private employment,' this ri ght is 'subject to reasonable government regulation.'\" Id. (quoting Conn v. Gabbert, 526 U.S. 286, 291-92, (1999)); see also Collins v. Texas, 223 U.S. 288, (1912) (the right to practice medi cine is not a fundamental right). Thus, while Plaintiffs may \"have a right to engage in their chosen prof essions,\" governmental infringement on this right will be \"presumed to be valid\" so long as it is \"rationally related to a legitimate state interest.\" Klaassen I Cleburne Living Ctr. , 473 U.S. 432, 440 (1985)). Indeed, fede ral courts have consistently held that vaccine mandates do not imp licate a fundamental right and that rati onal basis review therefore applies in determining the c onstitutionality of such mandates. Klaassen v. Trustees of Indiana Univ. II\") , 7 F.4th 592 (7th Cir. 2021) (rejec ting assertion by plaintiffs, who challenged Indiana University's mandatory C OVID-19 vaccine requirement, that the rational basis standard does not offer enough protection for their interests, indicating that the court \"must apply the law established by the Supreme Court\" in Jacobson v. Massachusetts, 197 U.S. 11 (1905), which, in holding that \"a state may require all members of the pub lic to be vaccinated against smallpox,\" \"shows that pl aintiffs lack\" a fundamental ri ght to be free measures); Klaassen I , 2021 \"the Case 1:21-cv-00783-MV-JHR Document 18 Filed 09/13/21 Page 12 of 30 -App. 17 -13 consistent use of rational basis review to asse ss mandatory vaccination m easures,\" and, in light of \"a century's worth of rulings, declining to \"extend substantive due process to recognize\" a fundamental right to be free from COVID-19 vaccination requirements); Harris v. Univ. of Mass. (\"[T]he case [challenging a policy requiring st udents who seek to be on campus to be vaccinated prior to fall semester] \"commends a deferential standard for analyzing Fourteenth Am endment challenges to generally applicable public health measures like the one here\"); Roman Cath. Diocese of Brooklyn v. Cuomo , 141 S. Ct. 63, 67 (2020) (Gorsuch, J., concurring) (explaining that \"essentially . . . rational basis review\"). \"To basis test, the [c hallenged governmental action] need only be rationally related to a leg itimate government purpose.\" Powers v. Harris, 379 F.3d 1208, 1215 (10th Cir. 2004). Rational basis review \"is highly defere ntial toward the government's actions. The burden is on the plaintiff to show the governmental act complained of does not further a legitimate state purpose by rational means.\" Seegmiller v. LaVerkin City , 528 F.3d 762, 772 (10th Cir. 2008). The government's decision \"mus t be upheld if any state of facts either known or which could reasonably be assumed affords support for it. Second-guessing by a court is not allowed.\" Powers , 379 F.3d at 1216-17. Moreover, \"rational-basis review does not give courts the option to speculate as to whet her some other scheme could have better regulated the evils in question.\" Id. at 1217. The Court \"will not strike dow n [governmental action] as irrational simply because it may not succeed in bringing a bout the result it seeks to accomplish, or because the statute's classifications l ack razor-sharp precision.\" Id. Nor will the Court \"overturn [an order] on the basis that no em pirical evidence su pports the assumptions underlying the [governmental] choice.\" Id. Indeed, the Court is \"not bound by the parties' arguments as to Case 1:21-cv-00783-MV-JHR Document 18 Filed 09/13/21 Page 13 of 30 -App. 18 -14 what legitimate state interests th e [order] seeks to further,\" but in stead \"is obligated to seek out other conceivable reasons for validating a state [order].\" Id. The Court finds that the PHO meets the ra tional basis test. \"V accination requirements, like other public-health measures, ha ve been common in this nation.\" Klaassen, 7 F.4th at 593. In Jacobson, the Supreme Court held that \"a community has the right to protect itself against an epidemic of disease which threatens the safety of its members.\" 197 U.S. at 27. Based on that premise, the Supreme Court declined to find unconstitutional, on either substantive due process or equal protection grounds, a Cambridge, Massa chusetts regulation th at required all adult inhabitants of that city, without exception , to be vaccinated against smallpox. The Supreme Court explained that \"when the regulation in question was adopted smallpox, according to the recitals in the regulation adopted by the board of health, was prevalen t to some extent in the city of Cambridge, and the disease was increasing.\" Id. The Court further explained that, \"in view of the methods employed to stamp ou t the disease of smallpox,\" no one could \"confidently assert that the means prescribed by the state to that end has no real or subs tantial relation to the protection of the public health and the public safety.\" Id. at 31. The Court not ed that while it did \"not decide, and [could not] de cide, that vaccination is a pr eventive of smallpox,\" it took \"judicial notice of the fact that this is the common belief of the people of th e state, and, with this fact as a foundation,\" held th at Cambridge's compulsory vacci ne statute was \"a health law, enacted in a reasonable and proper exercise of the police power.\" Id. at 35. The Court then found that, since \"vaccination, as a means of pr otecting a community against smallpox, finds strong support in the ex perience of this and other countries , no court . . . is justified in disregarding the action of the legislature simply because in its or their opinion that particular method was - perhaps, or possibly - not the best either for child ren or adults.\" Id. Case 1:21-cv-00783-MV-JHR Document 18 Filed 09/13/21 Page 14 of 30 -App. 19 -15 In reaching its decision, the Supreme Court considered a nd rejected the defendant's \"offers of proof\" of \"those in the medical profession who attach little or no value to vaccination as a means of preventing the spread of sma llpox, or who think that vaccination causes other diseases of the body.\" Id. at 30. The Court explained that it assumed that the legislature \"was not unaware of these opposing theories,\" and that it was for the legislature, and not the court , to \"determine which one of the two modes was likely to be the most effectiv e for the protection of the public against disease.\" Id. Indeed, the Court explained th at the legislature \"could not properly abdicate its function to gu ard the public health and safet y,\" and thus was compelled, of necessity, to choose between opposing theories on how best to \"meet and suppress the evils of a smallpox epidemic that imper iled an entire population.\" Id. at 30-31. The Court emphasized that the \"possibility that the be lief [in the efficacy of vaccines] may be wr ong, and that science may yet show it to be wrong,\" was \"not conclusive ; for the legislature has the right to pass laws which, according to the common belief of the people, are adapted to prevent the spread of contagious diseases.\" Id. at 35. Ultimately, the Court refused to allow the defe ndant to \"claim [] an exemption\" from the vaccination statute based on his offers of proof regarding the \"evil\" of vaccines, as doing so would \"strip the legislative depa rtment of its function to care fo r the public health and the public safety when endangered by epidemics of disease.\" Id. at 37. And in so re fusing, the Court noted that it was \"not prepared to hold that a minority, residing or remaining in any city or town where smallpox is prevalent, and en joying the general protection af forded by an organized local government, may thus defy the will of its const ituted authorities, acting in good faith for all, under the legislative sanc tion of the state.\" Id. The Court concluded: \"We are unwilling to hold it to be an element in the liberty secured by the Constitution of the United States that one person, Case 1:21-cv-00783-MV-JHR Document 18 Filed 09/13/21 Page 15 of 30 -App. 20 -16 or a minority of persons, residing in any commu nity and enjoying the be nefits of its local government, should have the power thus to dominat e the majority when supported in their action by the authority of the state.\" Id. With its decision in Jacobson , the Supreme Court \"settled th at it is within the police power of a state to provide fo r compulsory vaccination.\" Zucht v. King , 260 U.S. 174, 176, (1922). In the context of the current pandemic, courts have applied Jacobson to find that mandatory vaccine policies at state universities - all of which, like the vaccine policy at issue here, provide for medical, disabil ity, and religious belief exemp tions - meet the rational basis test. See Klaassen I , 2021WL3073926, at *27 (noting that, in light of the fact that the \"vaccination campaign has markedly curbed the pandemic,\" \"Indiana University insisting on vaccinations for its campus communities,\" thereby \"stemming illness, hospitalizations, or deaths at the university level[,] ha rdly proves irrational\"); Harris, 2021 WL 384012, at *6 (holding that university's decision to mandate vaccines was based \"upon both me dical and scientific evidence and research and guidance, and thus is at least rationally related to \" the \"legitimate interests\" of curbing the spread of COVID-19 and \"r eturning students safely to campus\"); America's Frontline Doctors No. 21-EDCV-1243, Dist. LEXIS 144477 (C.D. Cal. July 30, 2021) (holding that \"there is clearly a rational basis for Defendants to institute the Policy requiring vaccination\" to further the goal of facilitating the \"protection of the health and safety of the University community,\" where the policy was \"the product of consultation with UC infections disease experts and ongoing review of evidence from medical studies concerning the dangerousness of COVID-19 and emerging variants of concern, as well as the safety and effectiveness of the vaccines\"). Applying Jacobson to the PHO's vaccine mandate, the Court reaches the same conclusion. Case 1:21-cv-00783-MV-JHR Document 18 Filed 09/13/21 Page 16 of 30 -App. 21 -17 The governmental purpose of stemming the spr ead of COVID-19, especially in the wake of the Delta variant, is not only legitimate, but is \"unquestionably a compelling interest.\" Roman Cath. Diocese of Brooklyn , 141 S. Ct. at 67. Other legitimate goals follow from that, including: (1) protecting \"persons who may be extremely vuln erable to the virus an d at high risk for poor outcomes,\" \"children younger than 12 years\" who are not el igible for vaccination, and \"individuals who are not able to get vaccinated du e to a contraindication . . . or persons who may be severely immunocompromised and not able to mount an effective immune response to the vaccine\"; and (2) \"significantly reduc[ing] the tr ansmission of this virus from person to person\" in order to \"decrease the likeli hood\" of \"new mutations in the viral genome that could possibly lead to more severe disease or even the abil ity to evade the current vaccines and anti-viral therapeutics.\" Doc. 13-1 \u00b6\u00b6 14, 20-21, 26. Following the researc h, recommendations, and guidance of several medical and scientific sources, including the CDC, the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American Academy of Family Practice, the Infectious Diseases Society of America, the New Mexico state public health lab, University of Ne w Mexico, Los Alamos National Lab, and the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices , Defendants have determined that the three vaccines - which ar e \"extremely safe\" and, even against the Delta variant, \"highly effective\" - \"are the best to ol we have to protect individuals and protect communities from [COVID-19].\" Doc. 13-1 \u00b6\u00b6 15, 28. Notably, based on the scientific and medical research, Defendants have determined th at vaccinating health car e personnel is the \"best tool\" to protect patients who come into close contact with th em - patients who \"may be extremely vulnerable to the virus an d at high risk for poor outcomes.\" Id. \u00b6 14. Similarly, Defendants have determined that \"the most effective way to stop transmission both to children younger than 12 years\" and to \"individuals who are not able to get vaccina ted\" \"is to vaccinate Case 1:21-cv-00783-MV-JHR Document 18 Filed 09/13/21 Page 17 of 30 -App. 22 -18 eligible family members and those in the community where they live.\" Id. \u00b6\u00b6 20-21. Further, Defendants have determined that \"[t]he best tool we have\" to decrease the likelihood that new, more lethal mutations of the virus develop \"is through protecting as many people as possible by vaccination.\" Id. \u00b6 26. Finally, Defendants have deter mined that \"the immunity provided by vaccines may be more long-lasting compared to immunity gained following infection.\" Id. \u00b6 39. The vaccination requirements set forth in the PHO, thus grounded in medicine and science, are rationally related to Defendants' legitimate purpo se of protecting our community \"against an epidemic of disease [that] threatens the safety of its members.\" Jacobson, 197 U.S. at 27. As was smallpox in 1905, COVID-19 is \"pre valent to some extent\" in New Mexico and, because of the Delta variant, \"t he disease [is] increasing.\" Id. Since Jacobson was decided, the \"methods employed to stamp out\" diseases have continued to include vaccination, which, \"as a means of protecting a community against smallp ox [other diseases, and now, COVID-19], finds strong support in the experience of this a nd other countries.\" Id. Accordingly, no one could \"confidently assert that the means prescribed by the state to prevent the spread of COVID-19,\" namely, requiring certain individual s to be vaccinated, have \"no real or substantial relation to the protection of the public health and the public safety.\" Id. at 31. It follows that the PHO was \"enacted in a reasonable and proper exer cise of [Defendant s'] police power.\" Id. at 35. Indeed, \"this case is easier than Jacobson,\" as \"Jacobson sustained a vaccination requirement that lacked exceptions for adults,\" while the PHO has medical , disability, and religi ous belief exemptions, and \"does not require every adult member of the public to be vaccinated, as Massachusetts did in Jacobson,\" but rather is targeted to those individuals most likely to impact vulnerable populations. Klaassen II , 7 F.4th at 593. Case 1:21-cv-00783-MV-JHR Document 18 Filed 09/13/21 Page 18 of 30 -App. 23 -19 Plaintiffs decry the basis for the PHO as \"tech nocratic selective scie nce,\" and argue that it fails to take into account that \"Covid-recovere d individuals have equal to or better immunity response than vaccinated individuals.\" Doc. 14 at 2; Doc. 1 \u00b6 13. But Plaintiffs' \"disputes over the most reliable science\" are of no moment to the instant analysis, as \"the court doesn't intervene so long as [Defendants'] process is rational in trying to achieve public health.\" Klaassen I , 2021 WL 3073926, at * 38 (citing Phillips v. City of New York, 775 F.3d 538, 542 (2d Cir. 2015) (\"[P]laintiffs ar gue that a growing body of scientif ic evidence demonstrates that vaccines cause more harm to society than good, but as Jacobson makes clear, that is a determination for the [policymaker], not the i ndividual objectors.\")). As did the Court in Jacobson , this Court assumes that Defendants are aw are of \"opposing theori es\" on the safety and efficacy of vaccines; and as did the Court in Jacobson , this Court finds, as it must, that it is for Defendants, and not the Court, to determine what \"[is] likely to be the most effective [mode] for the protection of the public against disease.\" Jacobson, 197 U.S. at 30. Indeed, this is so regardless of whether \"science may yet show\" Defe ndants' belief in the efficacy of the COVID- 19 vaccines \"to be wrong,\" as Defendants have the right to enact orders \"adapted to prevent the spread of contagious diseases.\" Id. Plaintiffs also contend that the PHO represen ts an \"offensive disreg ard for the civil rights of the unvaccinated to make their own decision about what to put in their bodies trusting the science they think is best and their own doctors to decide for themselves what is best for them.\" Doc. 14 at 3. But the Jacobson Court made clear that the Four teenth Amendment does not grant individuals any such rights in the face of a state-imposed vaccine mandate. To the contrary, the Court explicitly refused to \"hold it to be an el ement in the liberty secured by the Constitution of the United States that one person, or a minority of persons, residing in any community and Case 1:21-cv-00783-MV-JHR Document 18 Filed 09/13/21 Page 19 of 30 -App. 24 -20 enjoying the benefits of its loca l government\" should have the pow er [] to dominate the majority by \"defy[ing] the will of its c onstituted authorities , acting in good faith for all, under the legislative sanction of the state.\" Jacobson, 197 U.S. at 38. In short, by failing to accommodate Plaintiffs' (or their doctors') vi ews on the COVID-19 vaccines, the PHO does not lack a rational relationship to a legitimate govern ment purpose. Indeed, to hold otherwise would \"practically strip [Defendants] of [their] f unction to care for the public hea lth and the public safety when endangered by epidemic s of disease.\" Id. at 37. For these reasons, the PHO meets the rational basis test. Accordingly, Plaintiffs are unlikely to succeed on the merits of their substantive due process claims. C. Equal Protection Claims Plaintiffs allege that Defenda nts are violating their equal pr otection rights because their \"actions create a class of individuals who . . . are punished for being unvaccinated and discriminated against without any real justif iable basis and without providing them any alternative,\" and \"[t]he PHO is not rationally related to achieving a compelling government purpose.\" Doc. 1 \u00b6\u00b6 59, 60 (emphasis in original). \"Equal protection is essentially a direction that all persons similarly situated should be treated alike.\" Dalton v. Reynolds, 2 F.4th 1300, 1308 (10th Cir. 2021) (citation omitted ). \"In order to assert a vi able equal protection claim, plaintiffs must first make a threshold showing th at they were treated differently from others who were similarly situated to them.\" Barney v. Pulsipher , 143 F.3d 1299, 1312 (10th Cir. 1998)). \"Upon this showing, [plaintiffs] must then demonstrate that the state acto r's differential treatment of [them] cannot pass the a ppropriate standard of scrutiny.\" Dalton, 2 F.4th at 1308. \"Different types of equal pr otection claims call for diff erent forms of review.\" Id. \"[U]nless a legislative cl assification either burdens a fundamental right or targets a suspect class, Case 1:21-cv-00783-MV-JHR Document 18 Filed 09/13/21 Page 20 of 30 -App. 25 -21 it need only bear a rational re lation to some legitimate end to comport with equal protection.\" Curley v. Perry , 246 F.3d 1278, 1285 (10th Cir. 2001) (citati on omitted). As discussed above, the PHO does not burden a fundamental right. Nor does it target a su spect class, as it does not \"categorize persons based on suspect classifications , such as race and national origin,\" or \"on 'quasi-suspect' classifications, su ch as gender FruitLands v. Todd, 279 F.3d 1204, 1210 (10th Cir. 2002) (citations om itted). Accordingly, the Court applies rational basis review, asking \"whe ther the government's classificat ion bears a rational relation to some legitimate end.\" Dalton, 2 F.4th at 1308. As explained above in the context of Plaint iffs' substantive due pr ocess claims, the PHO meets the rational basis test. Th e PHO, including its classificati on of individuals as to whom vaccination requirements apply, is grounded in medicine and science, and thus is rationally related to Defendants' legitimate purpose of protecting our community \"against an epidemic of disease [that] threatens the safety of its members.\" Jacobson, 197 U.S. at 27. Accordingly, Plaintiffs are unlikely to succeed on the me rits of their equa l protection claims. D. Procedural Due Process Claims Plaintiffs allege that the PHO deprives them of \"fundamental liberties without due process of law.\" Doc. 1 \u00b6 73. Because the P HO, however, \"is generally applicable\" to all congregate care facility workers, hospital worker s, school workers, State Fair attendees, and Governor's office staff, Plai ntiffs \"are not enti tled to [process] above and beyond the notice provided by the enactment and publi cation of the also United States v. Locke , 471 U.S. 84, 108 (1985) (\"In altering substantive rights throug h enactment of rules of general a pplicability, a legislature generally provides constitutionally adequate process simply by enacting the statute, publishing it, and, to Case 1:21-cv-00783-MV-JHR Document 18 Filed 09/13/21 Page 21 of 30 -App. 26 -22 the extent the statute regulate s private conduct, affording thos e within the statute's reach a reasonable opportunity both to familiarize them selves with the general requirements imposed and to comply with those requirements.\"); Oklahoma Educ. Ass'n v. Alcoholic Beverage Laws Enforcement Comm'n , 889 F.2d 929, 936 (10th Cir. 1989) (\"Wh en the legislature passes a law which affects a general class of persons, those pe rsons have all received procedural due process - the legislative process.\"); Curlott v. Campbell , 598 F.2d 1175, 1181 (9th Cir. 1979) (\"[W]e doubt very much that procedural due process prior to re duction of benefits is required when an agency makes a broadly applicable, legislat ive-type decision.\"). Based on this principle, courts in this district have held that the public health orders issued by Defendants in response to the current pandemic do not implicate pr ocedural due process. See Hernandez v. Lujan 3d at 1197-98. This Court agrees. Accordingly, Plaintiffs are unlikely to succeed on the merits of their procedural due process claims. E. Claims under Article I, Section 10 of the United States Constitution Plaintiffs allege that Defendants' vaccine re quirements \"constitute[] a bill of attainder\" and \"impair\" the contract entered into between Valdez and her children \"to participate in the New Mexico State Fair junior livestock competitions\" and Blackford's \"employment contract,\" in violation of Article I, Secti on 10 of the United States Constitution. Doc. 1 \u00b6\u00b6 75-76. In their reply brief, Plaintiffs appear to abandon their theory that the PHO constitutes a bill of attainder, referring to Defendants' arguments refuting that theory as \"a co mplete red herring.\" Doc. 14 at 7. Accordingly, the Court will consider only Pl aintiffs' remaining argu ment under the Contracts Clause of Article I, Section 10 of the United States Constitution, namely that Defendants have impaired Plaintiffs' existing c ontracts by enacting the PHO. Id. at 8-9. Case 1:21-cv-00783-MV-JHR Document 18 Filed 09/13/21 Page 22 of 30 -App. 27 -23 \"The Contracts Clause restricts the power of States to disrupt contractual arrang ements.\" Sveen v. Melin , 138 S. Ct. provides pass Law impairing the Obligation of Contracts.\" Id. (quoting U.S. Const., Art. I, \u00a7 10, cl. 1). Not all laws affecting pre-existing cont racts, however, violate the Clause. Sveen , 138 S. Ct. at 1821. The Supreme articulated a \"two -step test\" to determine \"when such a law crosses the constitutional line.\" Id. First, the Court asks whether the state law has \"operated as a substantial impairment of a contractual relationship.\" Id. at 1822. In answering that question, the Court considers \"the extent to which the law undermines the contra ctual bargain, interferes with a party's reasonable expectations, and prev ents the party from safe guarding or reinstating his rights.\" Id. \"If such factors show a substantial impai rment,\" the Court next asks \"whether the state law is drawn in an 'a ppropriate' and 'reas onable' way to advance 'a significant and legitimate public purpose.'\" Id. (quoting Energy Reserves Group, Inc. v. Kansas Power & Light Co., 459 U.S. 400, 411-412 (1983)). Here, Plaintiffs have failed to establish a \"substantial impairment\" of any contractual relationship. Plaintiffs have not provided the Court with copies of any of the purported contracts at issue or cited to any provi sions therein to demonstrate that the PHO undermines their contractual bargain, interferes with their reasonable expecta tions, or prevents them from safeguarding or reinstating thei r rights. And indeed, the ev idence available to the Court demonstrates to the contrary. First, as Plaintiffs concede, Blackford's employer, Presbyterian, has instituted its own private vaccine mandate - a manda te that reaches more broadl y than does the PHO - requiring its entire workforce to be vaccinated against COVID-19 in the absence of a qualifying exemption. Colleen Heild, Presbyterian requires vaccines for entire workforce of 13,000 , Santa Case 1:21-cv-00783-MV-JHR Document 18 Filed 09/13/21 Page 23 of 30 -App. 28 -24 Fe New was implemented simply so that Blackford's \"employer can remain compliant with the [] PHO,\" Doc. 14 at 8, but there is no support for this contention, as the PHO applies dire ctly to individual worker s rather than to the hospitals that employ them. Nor is there any indication that, but for the PHO, Presbyterian would not have instituted its own vaccine requi rements. Notably, commenting on its mandate, Presbyterian's president and CEO, Dale Maxwell, stated, \"We take care of some of the most vulnerable people in the state of New Mexico, . . . and I believ e . . . we should take every measure possible to deliver the safest environment.\" Id. Maxwell further stated that Presbyterian made its own independent decisi on \"to also include a ll other Presbyterian employees, including clini cal, clerical and health plan em ployees,\" because \"we believe at Presbyterian that vaccines are the best way to co mbat this pandemic . . . We know that vaccines reduce the spread of the infecti on and we know that vaccines re duce the illness of those that contract COVID-19. Any action to increase vaccines in our community, we support.\" Id. Thus, Blackford has no \"reasonable expectation\" th at she would be enti tled to continue her employment without being vaccinated, and thus ca nnot claim that the PHO substantially impairs her contractual rights. Similarly, while Plaintiffs allege that Vald ez has been deprived of the benefit of her contract with Expo New Mexico because her ch ildren cannot participate in the New Mexico State Fair junior livestock competitions, Expo New Mexico cancelled the 2021 New Mexico State Fair Junior Livestock Shows and Sale. See New Mexico State Fair website, https:// statefair.exponm.com/p/participate/competitions/livestock-shows . The website indicates that Case 1:21-cv-00783-MV-JHR Document 18 Filed 09/13/21 Page 24 of 30 -App. 29 -25 Expo New Mexico is \"issuing full re funds of all fees to our exhi bitors,\" and provides a form on its website for individuals who had contracted to attend to ma ke their request for a refund. Id. Because Valdez thus is entitled to a refund of the consideration that she paid for her children to participate in the State Fair, the PHO does not un dermine her contractual bargain. Further, she and her children will still be able to show their animals, as the New Mexico Youth Livestock Expo is going forward in Roswell, welcoming a ll entries free of charge and in an unlimited number. See New Mexico Youth Livestock Expo Facebook page, https: //www.facebook.com/NMJLF1989/photos/pb.181295355267698.2207520000../4601143193282 870/?type=3&theater . The fact that they may exhibit th eir animals in the New Mexico Youth Livestock Expo negates Plaintiffs' claim that th e PHO has \"fully removed the ability of these children to participate.\" Doc. 14 at 8. Even if Plaintiffs were able to show a substantial impairment of a contractual relationship, their cla im under the Contracts Clause would fa il because, just as it meets the rational basis test, the PHO is drawn in an appropriate and reasonable way to advance a significant and legitimate public purpose. For th ese reasons, Plaintiffs are unlikely to succeed on the merits of their claims that the PHO violates the Contracts Clause of Article I, Section 10 of the United States Constitution. F. State Constitutional Claims Plaintiffs allege that, by re quiring individuals to be vacci nated \"to maintain employment or enjoy the benefits of an ex isting contract,\" Defendants are vi olating Plaintiffs' rights \"secured by the New Mexico Constitution,\" and that such violation \"is actionable under the New Mexico Civil Rights Act [(\"NMCRA\")].\" Doc. 1 \u00b6\u00b6 81, 86. \"The eleventh amendment generally bars lawsuits in federal court seeking damages against states as well as against state agencies, Case 1:21-cv-00783-MV-JHR Document 18 Filed 09/13/21 Page 25 of 30 -App. 30 -26 departments, and employees acting in their official capacity.\" Bishop v. John Doe 1 , 902 F.2d 809, 810 (10th Cir. 1990). Nonetheless, a state \"may waive its eleventh amendment immunity and consent to suit against itself, related entities and employees.\" Id. Under the NMCRA, the state of New Mexico has waived sovereign immun ity \"for itself or any public body within the state for claims brought pursuant to the New Me xico Civil Rights Act.\" N.M. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 41- 4A-9. This waiver, however, is limited to ac tions commenced in \"any New Mexico district court.\" N.M. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 41-4A-3. The Tenth Ci rcuit has interpreted an alogous language in the New Mexico Tort Claims Act (\"NMTCA\") to m ean that a plaintiff cannot \"pursue [a] claim against [a state public body] and its employees acting within the scope of their employment in the federal district court, but rather is relegated to the state district court to seek relief consistent with the limited waiver of im munity under [the NMTCA].\" Bishop, 902 F.2d at 810. Here, Defendants invoke eleventh amendmen t immunity and argue that, because the NMCRA waives immunity only as to actions commenced in New Mexico state court, Plaintiffs may not pursue their New Mexico constitutional claims, brought pursuant to the NMCRA, in this Court. Doc. 13 at 32. In response, Plaintiffs argue that this Court nonetheless has pendent jurisdiction over their NMCRA claims. Doc. 14 at 9-10. This Court has c onsidered and rejected that argument in the analogous context of the NM TCA as \"incorrect as a matter of law.\" Quarrie v. New Mexico Inst. of Mining & Tech., No. 13-cv-349, 2014 WL 11456598, at *2 (D.N.M. Feb. 25, 2014). As the Quarrie Court explained, \"immunity under the Eleventh Amendment is not abrogated by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 13 67, and therefore, \u00a7 1367 does not authorize federal district courts to exercise jurisdiction over claims against nonconsenting states.\" Id. (citing Raygor v. Regents of Univ. of Minnesota , 534 U.S. 533, 542 (2002) (holding that \"\u00a7 1367(a)'s grant of jurisdiction does not ex tend to claims against nonconsenting state Case 1:21-cv-00783-MV-JHR Document 18 Filed 09/13/21 Page 26 of 30 -App. 31 -27 defendants\")). Plaintiffs have pointed to no contrary authority to suggest that Defendants have lost the right to invoke eleventh amendment immun ity solely because this Court otherwise would have supplemental jurisdiction over their NMCRA claims. Because Plaintiffs are unable to seek a deci sion on the merits of their NMCRA claims in this Court, they necessarily are unlikely to succeed on the merits of those claims. * * * Accordingly, Plaintiffs have fa iled to prove that they are \"sub stantially likely to succeed on the merits\" of any of their claims. Free the Nipple, 916 F.3d at 797. Because Plaintiffs \"must\" satisfy their burden as to each factor of the preliminary injunction test, Plaintiffs' failure to satisfy their burden as to th e likelihood of success factor is al one fatal to th eir request for preliminary injunctive relief. Peterson, 492 F. Supp. 3d at 1192. Nonetheless, the Court will consider the remaining factors of the preliminary injunction test. II. Irreparable Harm Plaintiffs argue that, because the PHO \"bur den[s] if not outright den[ies]\" their due process and equal protection rights, the irreparable harm standard is met. Doc. 1 at 23. But \"[a]s explained in the preceding sect ions, [Plaintiffs have] failed to demonstrate the requisite likelihood of success\" on their cons titutional claims and, \"[a]s a resu lt, [they are] not entitled to a presumption of irreparable injury.\" Schrier, 427 F.3d at 1266. Accordingly, to satisfy the irreparable ha rm prong of the preliminary injunction test, Plaintiffs must show that they stand to suffer \"an injury\" that is \"cert ain, great, actual, and not theoretical.\" Id. at 1267 (citation omitted). \"Merely serious or substantia l harm is not irreparable harm.\" Id. (citation omitted). Further, \"the party seeking injunctive relief must show that the injury complained of is of such imminence that there is a clear and pr esent need for equitable Case 1:21-cv-00783-MV-JHR Document 18 Filed 09/13/21 Page 27 of 30 -App. 32 -28 relief to prevent irreparable harm.\" Id. (citation omitted). Importantly, \"[i]t is [] well settled that simple economic loss usually does not, in and of itself, constitute irreparable harm; such losses are compensable by monetary damages.\" Id. (citation omitted). Similarly, \"[a] permanent loss of employment, standing alone, does not equate to irreparable harm.\" E. St. Louis Laborers' Loc. 100 v. Bellon Wrecking & Salvage Co. , 414 F.3d 700, 704 (7th Cir. 2005). Plaintiffs claim that \"[t]here is no adequate legal remedy for [their] intangible harms,\" namely, \"being terminated from their employ ment and from engagi ng in their chosen profession.\" Doc. 1 at 23. But, as discussed above, any harm to Blackford caused by her potential termination and/or inability to continue to work as a nurse is a function not of the PHO but rather of her employer's own vaccine manda te. And indeed, even if that harm were attributable to the PHO, being so terminated/pre vented from working as a nurse does not equate to irreparable harm. Similarly, Valdez cannot establish any harm from the PHO, because, as discussed above, Expo New Mexico ha s offered to refund all fees pa id to participate in the New Mexico State Fair Junior Livestock Shows and Sale, and Valdez and her children may enter, at no cost, the New Mexico Youth Livestock Expo. Furt her, Plaintiffs have failed to establish that any loss to Valdez resulting from the PHO is not compensable by monetary damages. Plaintiffs thus have failed to establish that th ey will suffer irreparable harm if the PHO is not enjoined. III. Balance of Harms Plaintiffs contend that \"the balance of harm s tips decidedly in fa vor of Plaintiff[s],\" because, if an injunction is granted, \"Defendants will suffer [only] speculative harm,\" but if an injunction is not granted, Plaintiffs will suffer \"an injury to [their] [constitutional] rights.\" Doc. 1 at 24. As the Court has already explained, Plaintiffs are unlikely to su cceed on the merits of Case 1:21-cv-00783-MV-JHR Document 18 Filed 09/13/21 Page 28 of 30 -App. 33 -29 their constitutional claims. Accord ingly, the threatened harm that Plaintiffs seek to prevent does not reach a constitutional magnitude. Nor can the Court agree that any harm to Defendants can be so easily minimized as \"speculative.\" To the contrary, the Court finds that \"the balance of equities tips in Defenda nts' favor given the strong public in terest here they are promoting - preventing further spread of COVID-19 [], a viru s [that] has infected and taken the lives of thousands of relief here would weaken the efforts of [Defendants] to carry out those goals.\" Id. \"Similarly, given the public health efforts promoted by the [PHO], enjoining the continuation of same is not in the public interest.\" Id. The Court thus finds that Plai ntiffs have failed to estab lish that the balance of harms weighs in their favor or that granting the requested in junction would not be adverse to the public interest. See ETP Rio Rancho Park , 2021 WL 765364, at *57 (holding that \"the threatened injuries - financial injuries and possible permanent business cl osure - do not outweigh possible damage - increased COVID-19 spre ad leading to sickness, hospitalizations, and death - to the Defendants,\" and \"for similar reasons,\" the reque sted injunction \"would be adverse to the public interest\"). CONCLUSION To obtain preliminary injunctive relief, Plai ntiffs are required to prove that they are substantially likely to succeed on the merits of their claims, that they will suffer irreparable injury if the Court denies the requested injuncti on, that the balance of harms weighs in their favor, and that the injunction woul d not be adverse to the public in terest. As set forth above, Plaintiffs fail to satisfy their burden as to any, let alone all, of these factors. Accordingly, Plaintiffs are not entitled to an order enjoining the PHO.

Dudley Office of the Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham Case 1:21-cv-00783-MV-JHR Document 18 Filed 09/13/21 Page 30 of 30 -App. 35 -IN THE UNITED STATES DIS TRICT COURT FOR THE DISTRICT OF NEW MEXICO TALISHA VALDEZ, on behalf of herself and others similarly situated, and JENNIFER BLACKFORD, on behalf of herself and others similarly situated, Plaintiffs, Case No. 21-cv-783 MV/JHR vs. MICHELLE LUJAN GRISHAM, Officially and Individually, Ac ting Under the Color of Law, and DAVID SCRASE, Officially and Individually, Ac ting Under the Color of Law, Defendants. ORDER THIS MATTER comes befo re the Court on Plaintiffs' Opposed Motion for Stay and Injunction Pending Appeal (\"Motion\") [Doc. 23]. Specifically, Plaintiffs request that this Court \"issue an injunction pending appe al that bars the Defendants fro m enforcing order or guidance requiring individuals to be fully vaccinated to continue in their employment and stay the matter before the Court.\" Doc. 23 at 2. As set forth herein, Plaintiffs do not meet the standards applica ble under Rule 8 of the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure for either a stay or an injunction pending appeal, and thus are not entitled to any of the relief sought in their Motion. Rule 8(a)(1) provides that \"[a] party must ordinarily move firs t in the district court for,\" inter a lia, \"a stay of . . . the order of a court pending appeal\" or \"an order . . . granting an injunction w hile an appeal is pending.\" Fed. R. App. P. 8(a)(1)(A), (C). A Rule 8(a) motion for a stay pending appeal \"is subject to the exact same standards\" as that ap plicable to a motion for a preliminary injunction. W arner v. Gross, 776 F.3d 721, 728 (10th Cir. 2015). Accordingly, to Case 1:21-cv-00783-MV-JHR Document 32 Filed 10/07/21 Page 1 of 5 -App. 36 -obtain a stay pending appeal, th e moving party must prove fo ur things: (1) \"that she's substantially likely to succeed on the merits\"; (2) \"t hat she'll suffer ir reparable injury if the court denies the injunction\"; (3) \"tha t her threatened injury (withou t the injunction) outweighs the opposing party's under the injunctio n\"; and (4) \"that th e injunction isn't a dverse to the public interest.\" Free the Nipple-Fort Collins v. City of Fort Collins, Colo. , 916 F.3d 792, 797 (10th Cir. 2019) (citation omitted). A Ru le 8(a) motion for an order granting an injunction while an appeal is pending \"demands a significantly higher justification than a request for a stay because, unlike a stay, an injunction does not simply suspend judicial a lteration of the status quo but grants judicial interven tion that has been withhe ld by [the] court[].\" 140 S. Ct. 1613, 1613 (2020). \"This power is used where the legal rights at issue are indisputably clear and, even then, spar ingly and only in the most critical and exigent circumstances.\" Id. In its Memorandum Opinion and Order entered on September 13, 2021, the Court determined that Plaintiffs failed to make the requisit e showing on any of the four factors required to obtain a preliminary injunction. Doc. 18 at 8- 29. Because Plaintiffs failed to demonstrate their entitlement to a pr eliminary injunction, they equally fail to demonstrate thei r entitlement to a stay pending appeal. Nor have Plaintiffs made any effort on the instant Motion to provide the \"significantly higher justificati on\" required for their request fo r an injunction pending appeal. \"Where, as here, a party seeks em ergency relief in an interlocutory posture, while local officials are actively shaping their respons e to the changing facts on the ground,\" the \"notion that it is 'indisputably clear' that [Defendants' vaccin e mandates] are unconstitutional seems quite improbable.\" South Bay United Pentecostal Church , 140 S. Ct. at 1614. In support of their motion, Plaint iffs argue that \"this case pl ainly satisfies Rule 8(a)'s 'impracticable' exception, as it will likely be futile to ask this Court for th e same relief the Court Case 1:21-cv-00783-MV-JHR Document 32 Filed 10/07/21 Page 2 of 5 -App. 37 -has just denied them in rejecting their injunc tion motion.\" Doc. 23 \u00b6 2. This argument is nonsensical here, where Plaintiffs are asking the district court - the same court that denied their request for a preliminary in junction - for relief. As noted above, Rule 8(a)(1) applies when a part y moves in the district court for a stay or an injunction pending appeal. In contrast, Rule 8(a)(2) applies when a party makes a motion for such relief directly \"to the court of appeals or to one of its judg es.\" Fed. R. App. P. 8(a)(2). Specifically, Rule 8(a)(2) allows fo r a party to skip the routine firs t step of seeking relief from the district court and instead go directly to the court of appeal s, if its motion \"show[s] that moving first in the district court would be impracticable.\" Fed. R. App. P. 8(a)(i). Impracticability thus comes into play only where a movant seeks relief in the appellate court, and not where, as here, the movant seeks relief from the district court. Accordingly, while the impracticability of moving for a stay or injunction in this Court well might have provided a basis for Plaintiffs to move for such relief (in the first instance) in the Tenth Circuit, it provides no basis for this Court to grant Plaintiffs a stay or an injunction pending appeal. Next, Plaintiffs argue that a stay or injunc tion pending appeal is warranted because this Court \"rendered its decision wit hout oral argument and without an evidentiary hearing\" and in particular, \"made its determinat ions that no irreparable harm was sufficiently alleged without allowing Plaintiffs an opportunity at hearing to present eviden ce\" that Blackford \"has been constructively terminated from her employment as a nurse a nd is prohibited from obtaining employment as a nurse anywhere else in the state.\" Doc. 23 at \u00b6\u00b63-4. But neither the federal rules nor Tenth Circuit precedent \"require the distri ct court to hold an evidentiary hearing or oral argument before deciding a motion for a preliminary injunction.\" Gess v. USMS and 10th Cir. Dist. Court , No. 20-cv-1790, 2020 WL 8838280, at *16 (D. Colo. 10, 2020) (quoting Northglenn Gunter Toody's LLC v. 702, 705 Case 1:21-cv-00783-MV-JHR Document Page 3 of 5 -App. 38 -(10th Cir. 2017)). Further, where a motion fo r a preliminary injunction \"fail[s] based upon the resolution of questions of law as to which there ar e no disputed issues of fact,\" it is \"unnecessary to conduct an evidentiary h earing or oral argument.\" Gess, 2020 WL 8838280, at *17 (citing Shaw Eng'g & Drafting, Inc. , 213 F.3d 538, 545 (10th Cir. 2000) (\"An evidentiary hearing, however, was unnecessary to resolve these legal issues.\")). Here, the Court decided as a matter of law that, based on the facts as pres ented by Plaintiffs, they did not demonstrate a substantial likelihood of success on the merits, irreparable harm, or that the balance of harms weighed in favor of an injunction. See, generally, Doc. 18. In making that decision, the Court accepted as true, inter alia, that Blackford has been \"constr uctively terminated from her employment\" and that, unless she applies for an ex emption, will not be able to work as a nurse without being vaccinated. See id. at 23-24, 28. Accordingly, th ere was no need for an evidentiary hearing or oral argument. Indeed, Plaintiffs did submit evidence along with their request for a preliminary injunction, including their declarations. See Docs. 1-3, 1-4, 14-2, 14-3. This Court was entitled to base its decision on those declarations and \"other documentary evidence.\" Bradley F.2d 1172, 1176 (3d Cir. 1990). Finally, Plaintiffs argue that their request for a stay or injunction pending appeal is supported by \"a similar proceeding in United States District Court for the Northern District of New York in which the Honorable David N. Hurd granted temporary relief to the plaintiffs,\" Doc. 23 \u00b6 6, case, however, is distinguishable, as it involves a challenge to a New York State Department of Health regulati on that mandates COVID-19 vaccina tion of health care workers and \"excludes any religious exemption.\" A, 2021 WL 4189533, at *1. The plaintiffs in A specifically sought, and the court granted, a temporary restraining order enjoining the \"defendants from enforcing the vaccine mandate to the extent it categorically requires health care Case 1:21-cv-00783-MV-JHR Document 32 Filed 10/07/21 Page 4 of 5 -App. 39 -employers to deny or revo ke religious exem ptions from COVID-19 vaccination mandates.\" Id. In contrast, the Public Health Order at issue he re contain s three exemp tions, including a broad religious exemption that en compasses personal beliefs. See Doc. 18 at 4. Accordingly, the A court's decision to grant a temporary restrain ing o rder enjoining enforcement of a vaccine mandate to the extent that it did not allow for religious exemptions is of no persuasive value here. For these reasons, the C ourt finds that Plaint iffs are en titled to neither a stay nor an injun ction pending appeal. IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED that Plaintiffs' Opposed Motion for Stay and Injunction Pending Appeal [Doc. 2 3] is DENIED. DATED this 7th day of October 2021.

JURISDICTIONAL STATEMENT The United States District Court for the District of New Mexico had subject matter jurisdiction to hear the underlying case pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331, 42 2201 and 2202. This Court has jurisdiction to hear this appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 129 2. The District C ourt for the District of New Mexico Entered a Memorandum Opinion and Order denying Plaintiffs' request for a Temporary Restraining Order and Preliminary Injunction on September 13, 2021. Plaintiffs filed a timely Notice of Interlocutory Appeal on September 13, 2021. STATEMENTS OF THE ISSUES 1. The Lower Court erred in denying Plaintiffs' request for Preliminary Injunction. STATEMENT OF THE CASE Father of the Bill of Rights and fourth U.S. President, James Madison, famously stated that \"crisis is the rallying cry of tyrants.\" Even today in modern day New Mexico, the last public health orders pronounced by the Governor through her Acting Secretary of Health prove that statement is as tr ue today as it was for the revolutionary period of our Republic's history. Not since the Appellate Filed: 11/08/2021 Page: 6 -App. 46 -2 Japanese internment camps that so darkly cloud our modern history, set out by President Franklin Roosevelt and upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court in Korematsu v. United States , 323 U.S. 214, 65 S. Ct. 193, 89 L. Ed. 194 (1944 does anything resembling the punitive tyrannical efforts contained in the public health orders at issue in this case even remotely arrive on the horizon of our Amer ican Liberty. Yet here, a tyrannical governor is willing to punish children and destroy livelihoods to punish adults that would dare to refuse her orders that advance her agenda of violating the right to bodily integrity. We stand at the precipice of losi ng the liberty that is foundational to our Country and these brave Appellants, in th e complaint , respectfully beg ged the lower Court to stop that destruction of liberty. Thomas Paine in American Crisis stated that: \"tyranny, like hell, is not easily conque red, yet, we have this consolation with us, that the harder the conflict, the more glorious the triumph.\" The Complaint in this matter was filed in the United States District Court for the District of New Mexico on August 19, 2021, with an emergency reques t for a temporary restraining order, and a request for preliminary injunction and permanent injunctive relief. (Aplt App 006 -042) The lower court, after ordering expedited briefing (Aplt App 044 -047), denied Plaintiffs/Appellants' request for temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction on September 13, 2021. (Aplt App 199 - 228) Plaintiffs/Appellants' timely filed an interlocutory appeal on September 2021. (Aplt App 229) STATEMENT OF THE FACTS On August 17, 2021 Acting Cabinet Secretary David R. Scrase, M.D. issued the Public Health Emergency Order Requiring Congregate Care Facility Workers and Hospital Workers be fully vaccinated. (Aplt App 008 , 276 ). As a result of the Order, Plaintiff Blackford and other Congregate Care Facility Workers and Hospital Workers similarly situated who are not currently vaccinated had to receive their first experimental EUA shot within ten days of the effective date or were required to be terminated from their employment in order for the employers to be lawfully compl iant (at the time of filing the FDA had not approved any of the vaccines .) (Aplt App 008, 128 -129). Plaintiff Blackford, based upon her medical training as well as experience as a nurse for 10 years, along with her own independent research, is opposed to receiving the EUA covid vaccines. (Aplt App 008, 054 -055). The Public Health Order does not give an exemption for those in the affected professions to abstain fr om being vaccinated without falling under one of the prescribed exemptions. (Aplt App 008 -009, 031 -036, 051) . The statute granting the Food and Drug Administration the power to authorize a medical product for emergency use requires that the person being ad ministered the unapproved product be advised of his and her right to refuse administration of the product. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 360bbb -4 individuals have equal to or better immunity response that vaccinated individuals, and covid -recovered individuals with natural immunity do not benefit from receiving the vaccines. (Aplt App 009 , 146 -147, 247 -248). The Public Health Order does not account for or recognize the health implications associated to individuals that have natural immunity. (Aplt App 009, 141 -143, 147 ). All three of the currently available Covid vaccines for the United States are available under an \"Emergency Use Authorization\" or \"EUA \" on an emergency declaration from the Secretary of Health under 21 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 360bbb -3. (Aplt App 009 , 049 -051, 120, 128 -139). Though Plaintiff disputes that the vaccines can be legally mandate d under the EUA (Aplt App 014 -015, 019 , 026, 028 ), the focus of this appeal and more specifically th e contemporaneously filed motion for injunction is directed to the constitutionality of the PHO and the impact to the fundamental liberties of Plaintiff Blackford and putative class members (Aplt App 016 -017, 02 4, 120 -121, 231 -232, 236) without according them owing due process. (Aplt App 013, 016 -019, 122 -123, 233 ). Plaintiff Valdez and her children originally also sought an injunction so that they could participate in the New Mexico State Fair, but the Fair has now passed mooting the need for injunctive relief and Plaintiff Valdez along with putative class members remain ing claims are limited to damages. (Aplt App 010) . Plaintiffs brought the suit in the lower court as a class action pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(a) and 23(b)(2), proposing two (2) declaratory and injunctive relief as well as damages. (Aplt App 011 -014). Plaintiffs claim that the actions of the Governor and her Secretary of Health are depriving them of equal protec tion, (Aplt App 015) due process of law (Aplt App 013, 016-019, 122 -123, 233 ) and of constitutional protections for preexisting (Aplt App 010, 012 -014, 017 -019, 121 123 -124, 237 -238). The lower court denied Plaintiffs' request for Temporary Restraining Order and Preliminary Injunction. (Aplt App 199 -228). In denying the request ed relief the District Court relied heavily, in consistent fashion with times , on Jacobs on to find that the collective good trumps individual liberty concerns of bodily integrity and engaging in one's chosen profession. (Aplt App 210 -212, 214, 216 -219). In so doing, the District Court ignored the abrogation of Jacobson by the Supreme Court when it stated that: Roe, however, may be seen not only as an exemplar o f Griswold liberty but as a rule (whether or not mistaken) of personal autonomy and bodily integrity, with doctrinal affinity to cases recognizing limits on governmental power to mandate medical treatment or to bar its rejection. If so, our cases since Roe accord with Roe's view that a State's interest in the protection of life falls short of justifying any plenary override of individual liberty claims. Cruzan v. Director, Mo. Dept. of Health, 497 U.S. 261, 278, 110 S.Ct. 2841, 2851, 111 L.Ed.2d 224 (1990); cf., e.g., Riggins Nevada, 504 U.S. 127, 135 , 112 S.Ct. 1810, 1815, 118 L.Ed.2d 479 (1992); Washington Harper, U.S. 210, 110 S.Ct. 1028, 108 L.Ed.2d 178 (1990); see also, e.g., Rochin v. California, 342 U.S. 165, 72 S.Ct. 205, 96 L.Ed. 183 (1952); Jacobson v. Massachusetts, 197 U.S. 11, 24 -30, 25 S.Ct. 358, 360 -363, 49 L.Ed. 643 (1905). Planned Parenthood of Se. Pennsylvania v. Casey , 505 U.S. 833, 857, 112 2d 674 (1992) . And only by ignoring that limitation against the plenary override individual liberty cl aims of the Plaintiffs here, was the District Court able to determine that Plaintiffs lacked the ability to satisfy a likelihood of success on the merits test for a preliminary injunction. Following the denial of the preliminary injunction and the filing of this appeal Plaintiff sought to have the District Court stay the underlying matter as well as injunction pending appeal and was denied by the district court. (Aplt App 276 -277, 296-300). It is also worth noting that the Fifth Circuit has issued a nationwide stay of the Biden OSHA Mandate , that is by any account a similar attack on individual liberty in favor of plenary override to the Public Health Order at issue in this case citing that \"because the petitions give cause to believe there are grave statutory and constitutional issues with the Mandate, the Mandate is hereby STAYED pending further action by this court. BST Holdings, L.L.C., et al., v. OSHA, et al., No. 21 - 60845 (November 6, 20 21). SUMMARY OF THE ARGUMENT A plaintiff seeking an injunction while an appeal is pending before this Court under Fed. R. App. P. 8(a)(1)(C); see also Fed. R. App. P. 8(a)(2), \"requires the applicant to address the following: (a) the likelihood of success on appeal; (b) the threat of irreparable harm if the stay or injunction is not granted; (c) the absence of harm to opposing parties if the stay or injunction is granted; and (d) any risk of harm Appellate -7 to the public interest. In ruling on such a request, this court makes the same inquiry as it would when reviewing a district court's grant or denial of a preliminary injunction. Homans v. City of Albuquerque , 264 F.3d 1240, 1243 ( 10th Cir. 2001) .1 Here, h ad the District Court correctly applied the law concerning infringements on fundamental liberties to perform its constitutional review to evaluate the likelihood of success , Appellants would satisfy the factors necessary for a preliminary injunction to issue. ARGUMENT Standard of Review This Court reviews the denial of a request for preliminary injunction for abuse of discretion. Utah Licensed Beverage Ass'n v. Leavitt, 256 F.3d 1061, 1065 (10th Cir.2001). Moreover: In doing so, we examine the district court's factual findings for clear error and review its legal determinations de novo. Davis v. Mineta, 302 F.3d 11 04, 1111 (10th Cir.2002); see also Prairie Band of Potawatomi Indians v. Pierce, 253 F.3d 1234, (10th Cir.2001); Tri-State Generation & Transmission Ass'n v. Shoshone River Power, Inc., 805 F.2d 351, 354 (10th Cir.1986). The abuse of discretion standa rd commands that we give due deference to the district court's evaluation of the salience and credibility of testimony, affidavits, and other evidence. We will not challenge that evaluation unless it finds no support in the record, deviates from the approp riate legal standard, or follows from a plainly implausible, irrational, 1 Plaintiffs /Appellants satisfied Rule 8(a)(1)'s requirement to \"move first in the district court for . . . an order . . . granting an injunction,\" by first requesting this very preliminary injunction from that court and then by subsequently filing a motion for relief pending appeal . Appellate -App. 52 -8 or erroneous reading of the record. United States v. Robinson, 39 F.3d 1115, 1116 (10th Cir.1994) (citation omitted). Heideman Lake City , 348 F.3d 1182, 1188 (10th Cir. 2003) The Mandatory COVID -19 Vaccination Directive issued by Appellees is in direct violation of the constitutional rights to bodily integrity and to engage in one 's chosen profession. Because these rights are fundamental to Appellants and putative class members , the proper constitutional measuring stick is whether when examined under strict scruti ny the PHO is narrowly tailored . Appellant respectfully, offers that had the District Court applied this standard of constitutional review based upon the jurisprudence of the Supreme Court that Appellants are likely to prevail on the merits and ha ve suffered an irreparable injury of being required to choose between a vaccine that irreversibly violates their bodily integrity or their employer being mandated by the government to terminate them from their chose profession for an indefinite period that h as now stretched into months , despite the fact that the Equal Protection Clause requires governments to act in a rational and nonarbitrary fashion. Appellees ' actions create a class of individuals who, though they exempted by federal law from being require d to receive the vaccine, cannot be deprived of their fundamental liberty interest to engage in their chosen profession and enjoy a fundamental right to bodily integrity that the state cannot deprive them of without due process of law . Moreover, they are p unished for being unvaccinated and discriminated against without any real justifiable basis and without providing them Appellate Case: 21-2105 any alternative. The PHO is not even rationally related to achieving a compelling government purpose much less narrowly tailored . Appel lees' actions are and have been therefore a violation of the Due Process and Equal Protection Clause s of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. Substantive Due Process prevents the government from engaging in conduct that \"shocks the c onscious\" or that interferes with fundamental liberty without narrowly tailoring such interference to achieve a compelling government interest which must withstand strict scrutiny. Appellees ' actions constitute official policy, custom and practice of the State of New Mexico. Appellees ' actions are not narrowly tailored as many individuals similarly situated to Appellants are covid -recovered and the actions ignore that measures such as masking , testing and social distance have been adopted as sufficient to achieve the compelling government interest for vaccinated individuals that remain just as likely to continue the spread of Covid -19. Appellees ' actions do not comport with the traditional ide as of fair play and decency. Appellants have the right to pursue lawful employment as they shall determine and be free of unreasonable governmental interference. The PHO imposed by the Appellees will cause Appellants and other similarly situation citizens of New Mexico to lose their livelihoods and to suffer the loss of their bodily integrity. No due process protections have been afforded to Appellant s, or any citizen of New Mexico, as required by the United States Constitution of a pre -deprivation Appellate -App. 54 -10 or post deprivation process that allows for any opportunity, much less a meaningful opportunity, to be heard and address the propriety of the government's actions. All fundamental rights comprised within the term liberty, including but not limited to, the rights t o be free from bodily restraint, the right to contract and engage in the common occupations of life, the right to acquire useful knowledge, to worship God according to the dictates of one's own conscience, and to generally enjoy the privileges long associa ted with the rights of free people are guaranteed substantive due process rights under the Fourteenth Amendment. The August 17, 2021 Order deprives Appellants, and many residents of New Mexico, of fundamental liberties without due process of law, based sol ely upon discretion of the Appellees in favor of exercising plenary power for the collective with no respect for the individual liberties fundamental to Appellant Blackford and other putative class members . Finally, t he actions of Appellees to require the termination of unvaccinated individuals that do not meet or request an exemption impair Appellant Blackford's employment contract and others similarly situated. Appellant s enjoyed a right to bodily integrity under the Fourteenth Amendment and Article II Se ction 10 of the New Mexico Constitution. Appellees ' actions to unreasonably require that the EUA vaccine injection be mandatory in order to maintain employment or enjoy the benefits of an existing contract violates Art. II Sec. 10. Appellants enjoy a right to due process and equal protection under Appellate Case: 21-2105 Document: 010110601982 Date Filed: 11/08/2021 Page: 15 -App. 55 -11 Article II Section 18 of the New Mexico Constitution. Appellees ' actions to unreasonably and contrary to federal law require that EUA vaccine injection is mandatory in order to maintain employment or enjoy the ben efits of an existing contract deprived Appellants of their owing due process and discriminated against them on the basis of the individual choice to vaccinate themselves. Appellants enjoy a right to contract free from government impairment pursuant to Article II Section 19 of the New Mexico Constitution. Appellants ' actions to unreasonably impair the existing employment contracts of Appellant Blackford and others similarly situated have violated those rights . The violation of rights secured by the New Mexic o Constitution is actionable under the New Mexico Civil Rights Act NMSA \u00a7 41 -4A- 1 et seq. which provides for damages and attorney's fees for violations of those rights in an amount to be proven at trial and the District Court 's declination of supplemental jurisdiction based upon the denial of preliminary injunction based upon an incorrect read ing of the law is likewise not proper. To determine whether a government act violates the substantive component of the Due Process Clause or the Equal Protection Clause, courts begin by determining the proper level of scrutiny to apply for review. \"Even th ough citizens of statutory counties are not a suspect class, we will still apply strict scrutiny if the state's classification burdens the exercise of a fundamental right guaranteed by the U.S. Constitution. Save Palisade FruitLands v. Todd -12 Cir. 2002) . An act passes strict scrutiny only if it is \"narrowly tailored to fur ther a compelling government interest.\" Id. \"If no heightened scrutiny applies, the statute need only be rationally related to a legitimate government purpose.\" Id. \"In deciding whether to recognize additional classifications as suspect, courts traditional ly look to see if the classification is 'based on characteristics beyond an individual's control,'[] and whether the class is 'saddled with such disabilities, or subjected to such a history of purposeful unequal treatment, or relegated to such a position o f political powerlessness as to command extraordinary protection from the majoritarian political process.'\" Id. (citations omitted). Appellees have not, because they cannot, explain how the Public Health Order (PHO) outlawing nurses from working as nurses in New Mexico does not implicate the long recognized fundamental liberty to engage in one's chosen profession as protected by the Fourteenth Amendm ent, nor how condition ing that fundamental liberty upon surrendering another fundamental right to bodily integrity does not implicate a violation of the right in favor of the plenary exercise of the collective power . Here, Appellant Blackford has plausibl y alleged and verified that she has protected property interest to engage in her chosen profession and that if the government's PHO mandate is enforced, she is prohibited from working as a nurse in New Mexico as long as the order is in effect , and she is u -App. 57 -13 It is important to note that her employer has implemented a policy in order to comply with the PHO mandate that has now resulted in her being placed on leave without pay for at least 4 months but had not done so prior to the issuance of the PHO. Appellant Blackford has identified a liberty interest warranting due process of law, Appellees disagree because otherwise their actions most certainly would run afoul of the Due Process Clause's protections by depriving Appellants of their ability to earn a livelihood in the occupation of their choosing.2 For example, the United States Supreme Court in Barry v. Barchi has opined as to the constitutionally protected property interest in engaging in one's chosen profession of horse racing, stating \"Plain tiffs have a liberty interest in pursuing their profession of horse racing and are entitled to due process of law if they are to be lawfully denied an opportunity to do so.\" Barry v. Barchi, 443 U.S. 55, 64, 99 S.Ct. 2642, 61 L.Ed.2d 365 (1979). Thus, the right of citizens to support themselves by engaging in a chosen 2 \"The right to work, I had assumed, was the most precious liberty that man possesses. Man has indeed as much right to work as he has to live, to be free, to own property. The American ideal was stated by Emerson \u00b7 in his essay on Politic s, 'A man has a right to be employed, to be trusted, to be loved, to be revered.' It does many men little good to stay alive and free and propertied, if they cannot work. To work means to eat. It also means to live. For many it would be better to work in j ail, than to sit idle on the curb. The great values of freedom are in the opportunities afforded man to press to new horizons, to pit his strength against the forces of nature, to match skills with his fellow man.\" Barsky v. Board of Regents of University of State of New York, 347 U.S. 442, 472 (1954) (Douglas, J, dissenting). Appellate Date Filed: 11/08/2021 Page: 18 -App. 58 -14 occupation is deeply rooted in our nation 's legal and cultural history and has long been recognized as a component of the liberties protected by the Fourteenth Amendment. Over a cent ury ago, the Supreme Court recognized that \"[i]t requires no argument to show that the right to work for a living in the common occupations of the community is of the very essence of the personal freedom and opportunity that it was the purpose of the [Four teenth] Amendment to secure.\" Truax v. Raich , 239 U.S. 33, 41, 36 S.Ct. 7, 60 L.Ed. 131 (1915) (holding t hat a state anti -alien labor statute violated both equal protection and due process). Later, in striking down a law banning the teaching of foreign languages in school, the Supreme Court observed that the Fourteenth Amendment guaranteed the right, inter al ia, \"to engage in any of the common occupations of life ....\" Meyer v. Nebraska , 262 U.S. 390, 399, 43 S.Ct. 625, 67 L.Ed. 1042 (1923). Despite later jurisprudence following the Lochner era, Lochner v. New York , 198 U.S. 45, 25 S.Ct. 539, 49 L.Ed. 937 (1905), de-emphasizing economic substantive due process, our Supreme Court has never repudiated the recognition that a citizen has the right to work for a living and pursue his or her chos en occupation. The Third Circuit has recognized \"[t]he right to hold specific private employment and to follow a chosen profession free from unreasonable governmental interference comes within both the 'liberty' and the 'property' concepts of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments.\" Piecknick v. of 1259 (3d. Cir. 1994) (citing Greene v. McElroy , 360 U.S. 474, 492, 79 S.Ct. 1400, 3 L.Ed.2d (1959); Truax U.S. at 41, 36 S.Ct. 7). However, [t]he Constitution only protects this liberty from state actions that threaten to deprive persons of the right to pursue their chosen occupation. State actions that exclude a person from one particular job are not actionable in suits ... brought directly under the due process clause. It is the liberty to pursue a calling or occupation, and not the right to a specific job, that is secured by the Fourteenth Amendment. Id. (internal citations and quotation marks omitted). Thus, the District Court was flat wrong, Appellant Blackford , and the many others simil arly situated , most certainly have a right to engage in their chosen professions of nursing, other healthcare employees, congregate caregivers or detention officers do as well . There is no question, then, that the Fourteenth Amendment recognizes a liberty interest in citizens \u2014the Appellants here\u2014to pursue their chosen occupation. The dispositive question is not whether such a right exists, but rather, the level of infringement upon the right that may be tolerated. It is supremely troubling that these Appel lees do not recognize the fundamental liberty interest of the individual to decide what should be injected into their person, otherwise recognized as the common law right to bodily integrity. The Supreme Court has recognized that \"no right is held more sac red, or is more carefully guarded by the common law, than the right of every individual to the possession and control of his own person, free from all restraint or interference of others, unless by clear and unquestionable authority of law.\" Union Pac. R. Co. v. Botsford , 250, 251, 11 S. Ct. 1000, 1001, 35 L. Ed. 734 (1891). Moreover, the Supreme Court has clearly held that \"[T]he forcible injection of medication into a nonconsenting person's body represents a substanti al interference with that person's liberty. Washington v. Harper , 494 U.S. 210, 229, 110 S. Ct. 1028, 1041, 108 L. Ed. 2d 178 (1990). In Harper , the Court was not dealing with a free person, but rather an incarcerated person, and as of yet citizens of New Mexico should not be treated as prisoners. Justice Stev ens dissented in Harper , arguing that the majority had \"virtually ignore[d] the several dimensions\" of the liberty interest it recognized. Id. at 237. He noted that a forced administration of medication is especially troubling if it \"creates a substantial risk of permanent injury and premature death.\" Id. He also recognized that such intrusions are \"degrading\" when performed against the will of a competent person. Id. In Riggins v. Nevada , 504 U.S. 127 (1992), the Court applied the test from Harper , finding that the state did not meet its burden to establish both the need for the drug and its medical appropriateness for the Defendant specifically finding th at the state was obligated to show that the medication was the least intrusive means of achieving an \"essential\" state purpose. Id. at 138. In Cruzan v. Director, Missouri Department of Health, 497 U.S. 261 (1990), the Court unequivocally acknowledged that \"[t]he principle that a competent person has a constitutionally protected liberty Appellate Case: 21-2105 Document: 010110601982 Date Filed: 11/08/2021 Page: 21 -App. 61 -17 interest in refusing unwanted medical treatment may be inferred from our prior decisions.\" Id. at 278. I. The Failure to Recognize Clearly Articulated Fundamental Liberty Interests Was Clear Error by the District Court . The District Court's failure to apply the correct constitutional analysis to Appellees as to why they can satisfy strict scrutiny that the PHO is narrowly tailored to meet their compelling or essential purpose led to clear error in determining the likelihood of success on the merits . As demonstrat ed above, this Court does not even need to perform a Washington v. Glucksberg , 521 U.S. 702, analysis to the alleged liberty interests because they have already been recognized as fundamental by the United States Supreme Court. There is no real debate that the right to engage in ones chose profession ( Barchi ) or the right to bodily integrity (Casey, Cruzan, Riggins , Harper, Rochin ) are not fundamental rights recognized previously by the Supreme Court. Moreover, to argue that the most sacred right as recogni zed as such by the Supreme Court to bodily integrity is not fundamental is tragically disappointing in our Republic ; but more importantly it means that it is at least quasi -fundamental and not subject to a rational basis test. Importantly, even if bodily i ntegrity is not a \"fundamental\" right, it is at least a \"quasi\" fundamental right subject to intermediate scrutiny. It is well settled that, under Plyler v. Doe, \"infringements on certain 'quasi - fundamental' rights, [like bodily integrity ], also mandate a heightened level of scrutiny.\" United States v. Harding , 971 F.2d 410, 412 n.1 (9th Cir. Filed: 11/08/2021 Page: 22 -App. 62 -18 added). Thus, because the District Court fails to address whether the PHO can withstand either strict or intermediate scrutiny and relies solely on a rational basis test argument, it incorrectly fails to properly assess likelihood of success on the merits, requiring reversal by this Court as upon the record Appellant has demonstrated a likelihood of success . II. The Appellees' Power from the State to Impair Contracts for Public Welfare is Limited and Appell ant Blackford is Also Likely to Succeed on the Merits of that Claim . As is typical for Appellees , they have found a blank check with unlimited power everywhere in the law and in every jurisprudence under the umbrella of public health du ring the COVID pandemic. This quite simply is not the case, as with Jacobs on (even before it was limited by Casey ), when it come s to impairment of contracts, the Supreme Court has set limits stating that \" the states' inherent power to protect the public we lfare may be validly exercised under the Contract Clause even if it impairs a contractual obligation so long as it does not destroy it.\" U.S. Tr. Co. of New York v. New Jersey , 431 U.S. 1, 26, 97 S. Ct. 1505, 1520, 52 L. Ed. 2d 92 (1977 ); citing 134 N.J.Super., at 190, 338 A.2d, at 870 -871. Here the Appellees ' PHO unequivocally destroys Appellant Blackford and putative class members' employment contracts. It destroys the employment contract o f Ms. Blackford by requiring her employer terminate her employment or prevent her from work ing to Appellate Case: 21-2105 compliant with the PHO . It is worth noting that when Congress does this, they are still required to pay damages to any harmed party under the Fifth Amendment . Here, because the destruction of the contracts is fully realized, this Court must examine the limit of state's actions to impair a contract as to the reasonableness of the conditions and of a character appropriate to the public purpose as the Supreme Court has warned \"private contracts are not subject to unlimited modification under the police power.\" U.S. Tr. Co. of New York , 431 U.S. at 22. Thus, Court must evaluate that limit, \"[a]ssuming that this stated interest is a 'broad and general social or ec onomic problem,' and therefore, a legitimate public purpose, the Court must then address the reasonableness and necessity of the regulation. Universal Ins. Co. v. Dep't of Justice , 866 F. Supp. 2d 49, 69 (D.P.R. 2012), on reconsideration in part (June 22, 2012). Essentially, a review as to reasonableness of this a particular measure , the District Court should have , and this Court must therefore conduct some review of the tailoring of the PHO's actions. As to the destruction of the employment contracts of healthcare workers like Ms. Blackford (despite the disingenuous and unsubstanti ated argument that the employers would have imposed that condition on those contracts regardless of the requirement of the PHO that they do so), Appellant s provided examples to District Court of the well understood fact that the vaccinated are as susceptib le to contracting Appellate 11/08/2021 Page: 24 -App. 64 -20 the disease and spreading the disease as the unvaccinated. There is no documentation that unvaccinated workers in the affected industries were being infected at any greater rate or severity than the vaccinated workers, that they were resp onsible for a greater rate of spread, that masking and other physical measures were not working, or that other treatments were not available short injection of gene modification therapies that work to treat Covid and slow its spread. (Aplt App 128 -164, 242 -275). It is simply not a reasonable condition to place the workers in such a position, who by all accounts serve as no greater threat for spread of the disease , to require employers to terminate them from their chosen professions and given the character of the government actions should still be evaluated under strict scrutiny for reasonableness and necessity. III. The Appellants Will Suffer Irreparable Injury if Injunctive Relief Is Denied \"The loss of [constitutional] freedoms, for even minimal periods of time , unquestionably constitutes irreparable injury.\" Heideman v. S. Salt Lake City , 348 F.3d 1182, 1190 (10th Cir. 2003) (quoting Elrod v. Burns , 427 U.S. 347, 373 (1976)) (emphasis added); As Appellants explained to the District Court , the PHO requires that Appellant Blackford and the putative class members must suffer one irreparable harm or another. The y must permanently lose their bodily integrity by receiving a vaccine they do not wish to have inside their bodies, or they must be indefinitely terminated from their chosen profession in New Mexico by their employer . Appellate -App. 65 -21 The fact that Due Process and Equal Protection rights are burdened if not outright denied, as they are in this case , establishes the preliminary injunctions ' \"irreparable harm\" standard. Thus, under the Tenth Ci rcuit Court of Appeals' jurisprudence, irreparable injury has occurred and will continue to occur until an injunction issues. IV. The Balance of Harms Favors Issuance of Injunctive Relief Appellant s have established both likelihood of success on the merits as well as a clear irreparable injury. In addition, the balance of harms tips decidedly in favor of Appellant s. In th is Circuit, \"the [government's] potential harm must be weighed against [ Appellants '] actual [constitutional] injury.\" Summum v. Pleasant F.3d 1044, 1056 (10th Cir. 2007) rvs'd other grounds by 555 U.S. 460 (2009). Where the government's perception of harm is speculative and when the state permits the same speculative harm in other places, as it is here, such speculative harm cannot outweigh an injury to the Due Process, Equal Protection and contractual rights of Appellants, who have established a substantial likelihood of success on the merits. If preliminary injunctive relief is not granted, and the Court later finds that the challenged laws impermissibly infringe constitutional rights, the Appellants will have suffered irreparable harm. After the fact, this Court will be unable to make things right again. By contrast, if this Court grants preliminary injunctive relief and Appellate Page: 26 -App. the District Court later finds against the Appellants , the Appellees will not have suffered any hardship that the Appellees do not currently countenance by allowing the vaccinated to work under conditions of masking, and social distancing . Because the Appellee s will not suffer more than speculative harm if an injunction is gra nted, and the Appellants will suffer certain harm in the absence of injunctive relief, the balance of hardships favors the Appellants . When Appellants establish that a case raises constitutional issues, as the Appellants have in this case, the Court should presume that the balance of harms tips in their favor. Sammartano v. First Judicial District Court , 303 F.3d 959, 973 (9th Cir. 2002). V. An Injunction is in the Public Interest Finally, Appellants establish that issuance of a preliminary injunction is in the public interest. The Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals recognizes \"it is always in the public interest to prevent the violation of a party's constitutional rights.\" Verlo v. Martinez , 820 F.3d 111 3, 1127 (10th Cir. 2016); citing Pacific Frontier v. Pleasant Grove City , 414 F.3d 1221, 1237 (10th Cir. 2005); ., 256 F.3d at 1076; Elam F.3d 1343, 1347 (10th Cir.1997 ). As discussed in Casey the right to bodily integrity is sacrosanct, just as the right to engage in one's chose professio n is fundamental requiring that the actions of the government to interfere with those right s should be limited , not simply allowed as plenary override in favor of the collective good of public health. Thus, Appellate Case: 21-2105 -23 an injunction is in the public interest and this Court should grant it. SPECIFICS OF PRELIMINARY RELIEF REQUESTE D Appellants request that the Appellees be prevent from enforcing the PHO order at issue in this matter during the pendency of the matter before the district court. CONCLUSION For all the foregoing reasons, the District Court's denial should be reversed and a preliminary injunction should issue . ORAL ARGUMENT STATEMENT Pursuant to 10th Cir. L.R . 28.2(C)(4), Appellants request oral argument in this matter. Such argument is necessary because the issues involve important questions of procedural law. Appellant respectfully suggests that the Court may benefit from the interactive conversation that or al argument would provide on these issues. Respectfully submitted this November 8, 2021.

Blair Dunn, Esq. 400 Gold Ave. SW, Suite 1000 Albuquerque, NM -1 IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE DISTRICT OF NEW MEXICO TALISHA VALDEZ, on behalf of herself and others similarly situated, and JENNIFER BLACKFORD, on behalf of herself and others similarly situated, Plaintiffs, Case No. 21-cv-783 MV/JHR vs. MICHELLE LUJAN GRISHAM, Officially and Individually, Ac ting Under the Color of Law, and DAVID SCRASE, Officially and Individually, Ac ting Under the Color of Law, Defendants. MEMORANDUM OPINION AND ORDER THIS MATTER comes before the Court on Plaintiffs' Verified Class Action Complaint for Civil Rights Violations Under 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1983; Violations of Ri ghts Protected by the New Mexico Civil Rights Act; Emergency Request for a Temporary Restra ining Order; Request for Preliminary Injunction, Permanent Injunctive Relief and Damages (the \"Complaint\") [Doc. 1]. The Court, having considered the Complaint and the relevant law, finds that Plaintiffs' requests for a temporary restrain ing order and a preliminary inj unction are not well-taken and will be denied. BACKGROUND Since its emergence last year , the novel coronavirus 2019, or Sars-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, has spread exponentially thro ugh the world, and New Mexico has been no exception. Doc. 13 at 3. The ease and rapidity with which COVID-19 spreads and its potentially Case 1:21-cv-00783-MV-JHR Document 18 Filed 09/13/21 Page 1 of 30 APLT Page: 31 -App. 71 -2 severe symptoms create a frightening potential for mass deaths and an overloaded healthcare system. Id. at 4. During the winter of 2020-21, the United States averaged nearly 200,000 new cases and 4,000 COVID-19-rela ted deaths every day. Id. at 4-5. One in fi ve New Mexicans who were hospitalized for COVID-19 passed away. Id. at 5. In February 2020, the United States Department of Health and Human Services (\"HHS\") declared a public emergency and instructed the United States Food and Drug Administration (\"FDA\") to grant emergency use authoriza tions (\"EUA\") for \"medical devices and interventions\" to combat the pandemic, including vaccines. Id. at 6. The FDA issued detailed guidance to vaccine manufacturers, requiring a determination that the vaccine's benefits outweigh its risks based on data from at least one well-designed Phase 3 clinical trial that demonstrates the vaccine's safety and e fficacy in a clear and compelling manner. Id. Three vaccine candidates emerged as front runners: Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna's two-dose mRNA vaccines, and Johnson & Johnson's (\"J&J\") single-dose viral vector vaccine. Id. By the time Pfizer, Moderna, and J&J appl ied for EUA status (w hich, for Pfizer and Moderna, was in November 2020, and for J&J, was in February 2021), each vaccine had undergone significant testing. Id. at 6-7. After a t eam of representatives from across the FDA reviewed the data submitted by each manufacturer and independently assessed the risks and benefits of the vaccines, the FDA granted EUA, for individuals 16 and older, to Pfizer and Moderna's vaccines in December 2020 and to J&J' s vaccine in February 2021, noting that each had met the expectations set out in the FDA's comprehensive guidance. Id. at 7. Pfizer's vaccine later received EUA for individuals 12 and older, and on August 23, 2021, received full FDA approval for individuals 16 and older. Id. at 8. Case 1:21-cv-00783-MV-JHR Document 18 Filed 09/13/21 Page 2 of 30 APLT Page: -3 Since the three vaccines received EUA status, over 368 million doses have been administered and over 173 million Ameri cans have been fully vaccinated. Id. Comprehensive data collected since the three vaccines received EUA status demonstrates that they are safe and highly effective in preventing infection and severe illness, and that serious adverse side effects from the vaccines are exceedingly rare. Id. at 8-9. Further, the immunity provided by the vaccines is significantly more robust than na tural immunity gained following infection. Id. at 9. In late 2020, the \"Del ta\" variant, a highly in fectious and possibly more deadly strain of the coronavirus, appeared in India; by mid-J une of 2021, the Centers fo r Disease Control and Prevention (\"CDC\") had labeled it a \"variant of concern.\" Id. The Delta variant now accounts for virtually all new infections in the United Stat es - including in New Mexico - and is believed to be twice as contagious as previous variants. Id. Studies indicate that individuals infected with the Delta variant are more likely to be hospitali zed than those infected with other strains. Id. While the Delta variant is more lik ely to cause \"breakthrough\" infe ctions than other variants, the vaccines still provide strong prot ection against serious illness and death in individuals who contract the Delta variant. Id. at 10. Although case rates in New Mexico had be gun to drop dramatically, the numbers rose rapidly with the rise of the Delta variant. Id. at 11. Back in June, there were approximately 60 new cases a day but by mid-August, there were nearly 900 new cases a day - a fifteenfold increase. Id. As a result, hospitals are again opera ting over their capacity to accommodate the surge of infected New Mexicans, the ma jority of whom are not vaccinated. Id. To stem the tide of new cases and ease the pressure on our ho spitals, on August 17, 2021, New Mexico Department of Health Acting Secr etary David R. Scrase, M.D., issued \"Public Health Emergency Order Requiring All School Workers Comply with Certain Health Case 1:21-cv-00783-MV-JHR Document 18 Filed 09/13/21 Page 3 of 30 APLT and Requiring Congregate Care Fa cility Workers, Ho spital Workers, and Employees of the Office of the Governor Be Fu lly Vaccinated\" (the \"PHO\"). Doc. 1-2. In relevant part, the PHO requires a ll \"hospital workers . . . to be fully vaccinated against COVID- 19 unless they qualify for an exemption.\" Id. at 3-4. The PHO also requires that \"[a]ll persons who are eligible to receive a COVID-19 vaccine and enter the gr ounds of the New Mexico State Fair . . . provide adequate proof of being fully vaccinated against COVID-19 . . . unless the individual qualifies for an exemption.\" Id. at 5. Both hospital worker s and individuals who seek entry into the State Fair \"may be exempt from the COVID-19 vacci nation requirement . . . if they have a qualifying medical condition which immuni zation would endanger their health, or they are entitled . . . to a disability-related reasona ble accommodation or a sincerely held religious belief accommodation.\" Id. at 4, 5-6. A religious belief exemption may be supported by \"a statement regarding the manner in which the ad ministration of a COVID-19 vaccine conflicts with the religious observance, practice , or belief of the individual.\" Id. at 4-5, 6. The PHO specifically indicates that the vaccine requirements se t forth therein are ba sed on the following scientific and medical evidence: \"the currently available COVID-19 vaccines are safe and the most effective way of preventi ng infection, serious illness, and death\"; \"widespread vaccination protects New Mexico's health car e system as vaccines decrease the need for emergency services and hospitalization\"; and \"the refusal to recei ve the COVID-19 vaccine not only endangers the individual but the entire commu nity, and further jeopardizes th e progress the State has made against the pandemic by allowing the virus to transmit more freely and mutate into more transmissible or deadly va riants.\" Doc. 1-2. On August 19, 2021, Plaintiffs co mmenced the instant action. Named Plaintiff Jennifer Blackford is a registered nurse employed by Presbyterian. Doc. 1- 3 \u00b6 2. She asserts that the Case 1:21-cv-00783-MV-JHR Document 18 Filed 09/13/21 Page 4 of 30 APLT if [she] refuse[s] to be vaccinated for COVID-19,\" and that, based on her \"medical training and her ow n independent research,\" she is \"opposed to receiving the EUA covid vaccines.\" Id. \u00b6\u00b6 4-5. Named Plaintiff Ta lisha Valdez, on behalf of herself and her 11- and 12-year-old daughters, has contracted to e xhibit their animals at the New Mexico State Fair. Doc. 1-4 \u00b6\u00b6 2, 6. She asserts that the PHO \"prohibits [her] and [her] children from attending the New Mexico State Fair and showing their animals,\" and that she has chosen \"not to be vaccinated\" and \"to refuse to have [her] child injected with an experimental EUA vaccine.\" Id. at \u00b6\u00b6 9, 12. Together, Plaintiffs allege that, unless this Court enters a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction, under the PHO, \"New Mexicans will be forced to take an experimental vaccine in order to retain their employment and will forever lose the ability to exhibit their unique animals at the New Mexico State Fair.\" Do c. 1 at 22. In their Complaint, Plaintiffs request \"a temporary restraining order to prohibit Defendants from enforcing public health orders against the Plaintiffs and other putative class member s that are similarly situated,\" and a preliminary injunction \"to prohibit Defendants from enforci ng public health orders in the arbitrary and capricious manner and fashion engaged by Defendants.\" Id. at 15. In an Order entered on August 23, 2021, the Court denied Plaintiffs' re quest for entry of an emergency order on an ex parte basis, explaining that Plaintiffs did not meet the requirements of Rule 65(b)(1) of the Federal Rules of Civil Pr ocedure that would entitl e them to a temporary restraining order \"without written or oral notice to the adverse party or its attorney.\" Doc. 3. The Court, however, set an expedited briefing schedule on Plaintiffs' re quest for preliminary relief. Id. Later that day, Plaintiffs filed a motion asking the Court to rec onsider its decision. Doc. 4. In an Order entered on August 25, 20121, the Court denied Plaintiffs' motion, explaining that Plaintiffs provi ded no basis for the Court to use its inherent authority to Case 1:21-cv-00783-MV-JHR Document 18 Filed 09/13/21 Page 5 of 30 APLT reconsider its decision to refr ain from issuing an order enjo ining enforcement of the PHO without providing Defendants with an opportunity to respond. Doc. 10. In accordance with the expedited briefing schedule set by the Court, Defendants filed a response in opposition on August 30, 2021, Doc. 13, and Plaintiffs' reply followed on September 1, 2021. Doc. 14. STANDARD \"A preliminary injunction is an extraordinary remedy, the excep tion rather than the rule.\" Free the Nipple-Fort Collins v. City of Fort Collins, Colo. , 916 F.3d 792, 797 (10th Cir. 2019). To obtain a \"typical\" preliminar y injunction, the moving party must prove four things: (1) \"that she's substantially likely to succeed on the merits\"; (2) \"that she'll suffer irreparable injury if the court denies the injunction\"; (3 ) \"that her threat ened injury (without th e injunction) outweighs the opposing party's under the inju nction\"; and (4) \"that the injunction isn't adverse to the public interest.\" Id. (citation omitted).1 \"The third and fourth fact ors 'merge' when, like here, the government is the opposing party.\" Aposhian v. Barr , 958 F.3d 969, 978 (10th Cir. 2021) (quoting Nken v. Holder , 556 U.S. 418, 435 (2009)). \"[B]ecaus e a preliminary injunction is an extraordinary remedy, the [movant 's] right to relief must be clear and unequivocal.\" Id. (quoting Dominion Video Satellite, Inc. v. Echostar Satellite Corp. , 356 F.3d 1256, 1261 (10th Cir. 2004) (internal quotation marks omitted )). Notably, the movant \"must\" satisfy her burden as to each element; the elements \"do not establish a balanci ng test - each must be satisfied independently, 1 As noted above, Plaintiffs request both a temporary restra ining order and a preliminary injunction. Where, as here, ther e has been notice to the adverse party, a motion for a temporary restraining order \"may be treated by the cour t as a motion for preliminary injunction.\" 13 Moore's Federal Practice \u00a7 65.31 (2920). Further, the standard applicable to a motion for a preliminary injunction is the same as that app licable to a motion for a temporary restraining order. Firebird Structures, LLC v. United Bhd. of Carpenters & Joiners of Am., Local Union No. 1505, 252 F. Supp. 3d 1132, 1156 (D.N.M. 2017). Accord ingly, the Court analyzes Plaintiffs' requests for temporary and preliminary relief togeth er as a request for a preliminary injunction. Case 1:21-cv-00783-MV-JHR Document 18 Filed 09/13/21 Page 6 of 30 APLT and the strength of one cannot compen sate for the weakne ss of another.\" Citizens Against Our Env't v. Jewell, 839 F. 3d 1276, 1282 (10th Cir. 2016)). Courts, however, \"'disfavor' some preliminar y injunctions and so require more of the parties who request them.\" Free the Nipple , 916 F.3d at 797 relative posit ions exhibit any of three charac teristics\": (1) \"it mandates action (rather than prohibiting it)\"; (2) \"it changes the status quo\"; or (3) \"it grants all the relief that the m oving party could expect from a trial win.\" Free the Nipple , 916 F.3d at 797. To obtain a \"disfavored\" preliminary injunction, the moving party \"faces a heavier bur den on the likelihood-of-success-on-the merits and the balance-of-harms factors, \" namely, she must make a \"strong showing that these tilt in her favor.\" Id. (citation omitted). DISCUSSION Defendants argue that the in junction Plaintiffs seek, na mely, \"to prohibit Defendants from enforcing public health orders,\" is disfavored for two reasons: (1) Plaintiffs seek the same injunctive relief sought in their Complaint, and thus \"seek virt ually all the relief they could be awarded at the end of trial on the merits\"; and (2) an injunc tion would \"force Defendants to affirmatively alter the PHO and the State's enforcement of it,\" thus changing the status quo. Doc. 13 at 15-16. The Court is inclined to agree that the requested pr eliminary injunction is disfavored. See Peterson , 492 F. Supp. 3d at 1193 (finding th at the requested preliminary injunction, namely, requiring defenda nts to allow private schools to conduct in-person learning at 50% capacity, was disfavored because it would change the status quo set by the challenged Case 1:21-cv-00783-MV-JHR Document 18 Filed 09/13/21 Page 7 of 30 APLT Page: 37 -8 public health order, which imposed a 25% capacity limitation on private schools, and because the requested preliminary relief was \"an exact overlay of relief sought \" in plaintiffs ' complaint). The Court, however, need not decide whether the heightened disfavor ed-injunction standard applies, thus requiring \"strong\" s howings from Plaintiffs on the fi rst and third factors, because, as set forth herein, Plaintiffs fail to make even the baseline showing on any of the four factors as required to obtain a \"typical\" injunction. I. Likelihood of Success on the Merits In their Complaint, Plaintiffs assert that the PHO's vaccine requirements violate the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (\"FDCA\"), their Fourteenth Amen dment rights to equal protection, substantive due process, and procedur al due process, their rights under Article 1, Section 10 of the United States Constitution, and their rights under the New Mexico Constitution. Doc. 1 at 9-14. Plaintiffs, however, have failed to establish that any of these claims are likely to succeed on the merits. A. FDCA Claims According to Plaintiffs, by mandating that certain individuals be vaccinated against COVID-19, the PHO violates the FDCA, because the provisions of the FDCA relevant to medical products under an EUA \"state[] that wh ere a medical product is 'unapproved' then no one may be mandated to take it.\" Doc. 1 \u00b6 54 (quoting 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 360bbb-3(e)). As an initial matter, and despite Plaintiffs' protestation to the contrary, the FDA has now given its full approval - not just emergency us e authorization - to the Pfizer vaccine as administered to individuals 16 years of age and older. See FDA News Release, https://www.fda.gov/emergency- preparedness-and-response/coronavirus-diseas e-2019-covid-19/comirnaty-and-pfizer-biontech- covid-19-vaccine (\"On August 23, 2021, the FDA approved the first COVID-19 vaccine. The Case 1:21-cv-00783-MV-JHR Document 18 Filed 09/13/21 Page 8 of 30 APLT vaccine has been known as the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine, and will now be marketed as Comirnaty , for the prevention of COVID-19 disease in individuals 16 years of age and older.\"). Accordingly, the provisions of the FDCA quoted by Plaintiff, which are applicable only to medical products under an EUA, are not a pplicable to the admini stration of the Pfizer vaccine to individuals 16 years of age and older. Further, while the statutory pr ovisions quoted by Plaintiffs ap ply to the Moderna vaccine, the J&J vaccine, and the Pfizer vaccine as administered to individuals under the age of 16, those provisions nowhere prevent the stat e, or any other entity, from requi ring certain individuals to be vaccinated against COVID-19. Rather, in releva nt part, the FDCA requires that, for medical products under an EUA, \"HHS must establish co nditions to facilitate informed (7th Cir. 2021) (citing 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 360bbb-3(e)(1)(A)(ii)). Specifically, \" HHS must ensure that individuals taking the vaccine are informed that the Se cretary has authorized the emerge ncy use of the product,\" \"of the significant known and potential benefits and risks of such use, and of the extent to which such benefits and risks are unknown,\" and \"of the op tion to accept or refuse administration of the product, of the consequences, if any, of refusing admin istration of the pr oduct, and of the alternatives to the product that are ava ilable and of their be nefits I , at are not \"directly administering the va ccine\" to hospital workers and individuals who seek entry into the State Fair; instead, they ar e requiring such individuals \"to obtain the vaccine from a medical provider and to attest that th ey have been vaccinated, save for certain Case 1:21-cv-00783-MV-JHR Document 18 Filed 09/13/21 Page 9 of 30 APLT exemptions.\" Id. The individuals \"will be informed of the risks and benefits of the vaccine and of the option to accept or refuse the vaccine by their medical providers.\" Id. Accordingly, to the extent that the vaccine s at issue here remain subject to the EUA provisions of the FDCA, the PHO does not run afoul of those provisions. Id.; see also Bridges v. Hous. Methodist 12, (rejecting hospital employee's clai m, virtually identical to Plaintiffs' claim here, that under FDCA \"no one can be mandated to receive 'unapp roved' medicines in emergencies,\" noting that the FDCA \"confers certain power s and responsibilities to the Secretary of Health and Human Services in an emergency,\" \"n either expands nor restricts th e responsibilities of private employers,\" and \"does not conf er a private opportunity to sue the government\"); Dep't of Justice, Whether Section 564 of the Food, Drug and Co smetic Act Prohibi ts Entities from Requiring the Use of a Vaccine Subject to an Emergency Use Authorization at 2 (July 6, 2021), https://www.justice.gov/olc/file/1415446/download (finding that informed consent provision in FDCA \"specifies only that certain information be provided to potential vaccine recipients and does not prohibit entities from impos ing vaccination requirements\"). It follows that Plaintiffs are unlikely to succeed on the merits of their FDCA claims. B. Substantive Due Process Claims Plaintiffs generally allege that they \"have [constitutionally] protected liberty interests\" \"in their right to live without governmental interference,\" their ri ght \"to bodily integrity,\" their right \"to raise their children as they see fit, \" and their right \"to e ngage in their chosen professions,\" and that because the PHO is \"not narrowly tailored,\" it violates these substantive due process rights. Doc. 1 \u00b6\u00b6 63, 65. Here, \"plaintiffs advance a s ubstantive due process challenge to a legislative enactment,\" namely, the PHO. Dias v. City & Cty. of Denver , 567 F.3d Case 1:21-cv-00783-MV-JHR Document 18 Filed 09/13/21 Page 10 of 30 APLT (10th Cir. 2009) (emphasis in original); see also ETP Rio Rancho Park, LLC, v. \"[although the NMDOH - a state executive agency\" - issued the challenged PHO, that PHO was \"akin to a legislative action\"). Accordingly, a \"two-part substantive due process framework is applicable.\" Dias , 567 F.3d at 2021 765364, two-part approach to park ow ners' substantive due process challenge to PHO that limited operations for recreational facilities) . First, the Court must \"carefully describe the asserted fundamental liberty interest.\" Dias , 567 F.3d at 1182 (citation omitted). Second, the Cour t must decide \"whether that inte rest is 'deeply rooted in this Nation's history and tradition' and 'implicit in th e concept of ordered liberty, such that neither liberty nor justice would exist if they were sacrificed.'\" Id. (quoting Washington v. Glucksberg, 521 U.S. 702, 720-21 (1997)). If the Court determines that the rights asse rted are fundamental, the Fourteenth Amendment \"forbids the government to infringe [thos e] rights at all, . . . unless the infringement is narrowly tailored to serve a compelling state interest.\" Glucksberg , 521 U.S. at 721. If the legislative (or executive) action at issue \"does not implicate a fundamental right, it must nonetheless bear a rationa l relationship to a legitimate government interest.\" Dias , 567 F.3d at 1182 (citation omitted). Here, Plaintiffs' assertion of broadly defined rights falls short of providing the \"careful description of the assert ed fundamental liberty interest\" required under Glucksberg to establish a fundamental right . ETP Rio Rancho Park, 2021 WL 765364, at * 42. Plaintiffs do not explain how the rights allegedly violated by the PHO are fundamental ; indeed nowhere, do they address how the right to work in a hospital or attend th e State Fair, unvaccinate d and during a pandemic, is \"deeply rooted in this Na tion's history and tradition.\" Id. Case 1:21-cv-00783-MV-JHR Document 18 Filed 09/13/21 Page 11 30 -App. In support of their request for preliminary reli ef, Plaintiffs focus solely on the right to \"engage in their chosen professi on,\" which they contend \"is deeply rooted in our nation's legal and cultural history and has long been recognized as a component of the liberties protected by the Fourteenth Amendment.\" Doc. 14 at 6. Bu t the Tenth Circuit has unequivocally held that the \"right to practice in [one's ] chosen profession . . . does liberty component of the Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process Clause includes some genera lized due process right to choose one's field of private employment,' this ri ght is 'subject to reasonable government regulation.'\" Id. (quoting Conn v. Gabbert, 526 U.S. 286, 291-92, (1999)); see also Collins v. Texas, 223 U.S. 288, (1912) (the right to practice medi cine is not a fundamental right). Thus, while Plaintiffs may \"have a right to engage in their chosen prof essions,\" governmental infringement on this right will be \"presumed to be valid\" so long as it is \"rationally related to a legitimate state interest.\" Klaassen I Cleburne Living Ctr. , 473 U.S. 432, 440 (1985)). Indeed, fede ral courts have consistently held that vaccine mandates do not imp licate a fundamental right and that rati onal basis review therefore applies in determining the c onstitutionality of such mandates. Klaassen v. Trustees of Indiana Univ. II\") , 7 F.4th 592 (7th Cir. 2021) (rejec ting assertion by plaintiffs, who challenged Indiana University's mandatory C OVID-19 vaccine requirement, that the rational basis standard does not offer enough protection for their interests, indicating that the court \"must apply the law established by the Supreme Court\" in Jacobson v. Massachusetts, 197 U.S. 11 (1905), which, in holding that \"a state may require all members of the pub lic to be vaccinated against smallpox,\" \"shows that pl aintiffs lack\" a fundamental ri ght to be free measures); Klaassen I , 2021 \"the Case 1:21-cv-00783-MV-JHR Document 18 Filed 09/13/21 Page 12 of 30 APLT Page: 42 -App. 82 -13 consistent use of rational basis review to assess mandatory vaccination m easures,\" and, in light of \"a century's worth of rulings, declining to \"extend substantive due process to recognize\" a fundamental right to be free from COVID-19 vaccination requirements); Harris v. Univ. of Mass. (\"[T]he case [challenging a policy requiring st udents who seek to be on campus to be vaccinated prior to fall semester] \"commends a deferential standard for analyzing Fourteenth Am endment challenges to generally applicable public health measures like the one here\"); Roman Cath. Diocese of Brooklyn v. Cuomo , 141 S. Ct. 63, 67 (2020) (Gorsuch, J., concurring) (explaining that \"essentially . . . rational basis review\"). \"To basis test, the [c hallenged governmental action] need only be rationally related to a leg itimate government purpose.\" Powers v. Harris, 379 F.3d 1208, 1215 (10th Cir. 2004). Rational basis review \"is highly defere ntial toward the government's actions. The burden is on the plaintiff to show the governmental act complained of does not further a legitimate state purpose by rational means.\" Seegmiller v. LaVerkin City , 528 F.3d 762, 772 (10th Cir. 2008). The government's decision \"mus t be upheld if any state of facts either known or which could reasonably be assumed affords support for it. Second-guessing by a court is not allowed.\" Powers , 379 F.3d at 1216-17. Moreover, \"rational-basis review does not give courts the option to speculate as to whet her some other scheme could have better regulated the evils in question.\" Id. at 1217. The Court \"will not strike dow n [governmental action] as irrational simply because it may not succeed in bringing a bout the result it seeks to accomplish, or because the statute's classifications l ack razor-sharp precision.\" Id. Nor will the Court \"overturn [an order] on the basis that no em pirical evidence su pports the assumptions underlying the [governmental] choice.\" Id. Indeed, the Court is \"not bound by the parties' arguments as to Case 1:21-cv-00783-MV-JHR Document 18 Filed 09/13/21 Page 13 of 30 APLT Page: 43 -14 what legitimate state interests th e [order] seeks to further,\" but in stead \"is obligated to seek out other conceivable reasons for validating a state [order].\" Id. The Court finds that the PHO meets the ra tional basis test. \"V accination requirements, like other public-health measures, ha ve been common in this nation.\" Klaassen, 7 F.4th at 593. In Jacobson, the Supreme Court held that \"a community has the right to protect itself against an epidemic of disease which threatens the safety of its members.\" 197 U.S. at 27. Based on that premise, the Supreme Court declined to find unconstitutional, on either substantive due process or equal protection grounds, a Cambridge, Massa chusetts regulation th at required all adult inhabitants of that city, without exception , to be vaccinated against smallpox. The Supreme Court explained that \"when the regulation in question was adopted smallpox, according to the recitals in the regulation adopted by the board of health, was prevalen t to some extent in the city of Cambridge, and the disease was increasing.\" Id. The Court further explained that, \"in view of the methods employed to stamp ou t the disease of smallpox,\" no one could \"confidently assert that the means prescribed by the state to that end has no real or subs tantial relation to the protection of the public health and the public safety.\" Id. at 31. The Court not ed that while it did \"not decide, and [could not] de cide, that vaccination is a pr eventive of smallpox,\" it took \"judicial notice of the fact that this is the common belief of the people of th e state, and, with this fact as a foundation,\" held th at Cambridge's compulsory vacci ne statute was \"a health law, enacted in a reasonable and proper exercise of the police power.\" Id. at 35. The Court then found that, since \"vaccination, as a means of pr otecting a community against smallpox, finds strong support in the ex perience of this and other countries , no court . . . is justified in disregarding the action of the legislature simply because in its or their opinion that particular method was - perhaps, or possibly - not the best either for child ren or adults.\" Id. Case 1:21-cv-00783-MV-JHR Document 18 Filed 09/13/21 Page 14 of 30 APLT Page: 44 -App. 84 -15 In reaching its decision, the Supreme Court considered a nd rejected the defendant's \"offers of proof\" of \"those in the medical profession who attach little or no value to vaccination as a means of preventing the spread of sma llpox, or who think that vaccination causes other diseases of the body.\" Id. at 30. The Court explained that it assumed that the legislature \"was not unaware of these opposing theories,\" and that it was for the legislature, and not the court , to \"determine which one of the two modes was likely to be the most effectiv e for the protection of the public against disease.\" Id. Indeed, the Court explained th at the legislature \"could not properly abdicate its function to gu ard the public health and safet y,\" and thus was compelled, of necessity, to choose between opposing theories on how best to \"meet and suppress the evils of a smallpox epidemic that imper iled an entire population.\" Id. at 30-31. The Court emphasized that the \"possibility that the be lief [in the efficacy of vaccines] may be wr ong, and that science may yet show it to be wrong,\" was \"not conclusive ; for the legislature has the right to pass laws which, according to the common belief of the people, are adapted to prevent the spread of contagious diseases.\" Id. at 35. Ultimately, the Court refused to allow the defe ndant to \"claim [] an exemption\" from the vaccination statute based on his offers of proof regarding the \"evil\" of vaccines, as doing so would \"strip the legislative depa rtment of its function to care fo r the public health and the public safety when endangered by epidemics of disease.\" Id. at 37. And in so re fusing, the Court noted that it was \"not prepared to hold that a minority, residing or remaining in any city or town where smallpox is prevalent, and en joying the general protection af forded by an organized local government, may thus defy the will of its const ituted authorities, acting in good faith for all, under the legislative sanc tion of the state.\" Id. The Court concluded: \"We are unwilling to hold it to be an element in the liberty secured by the Constitution of the United States that one person, Case 1:21-cv-00783-MV-JHR Document 18 Filed 09/13/21 Page 15 of 30 APLT Page: 45 -App. 85 -16 or a minority of persons, residing in any commu nity and enjoying the be nefits of its local government, should have the power thus to dominat e the majority when supported in their action by the authority of the state.\" Id. With its decision in Jacobson , the Supreme Court \"settled th at it is within the police power of a state to provide fo r compulsory vaccination.\" Zucht v. King , 260 U.S. 174, 176, (1922). In the context of the current pandemic, courts have applied Jacobson to find that mandatory vaccine policies at state universities - all of which, like the vaccine policy at issue here, provide for medical, disabil ity, and religious belief exemp tions - meet the rational basis test. See Klaassen I , 2021WL3073926, at *27 (noting that, in light of the fact that the \"vaccination campaign has markedly curbed the pandemic,\" \"Indiana University insisting on vaccinations for its campus communities,\" thereby \"stemming illness, hospitalizations, or deaths at the university level[,] ha rdly proves irrational\"); Harris, 2021 WL 384012, at *6 (holding that university's decision to mandate vaccines was based \"upon both me dical and scientific evidence and research and guidance, and thus is at least rationally related to \" the \"legitimate interests\" of curbing the spread of COVID-19 and \"r eturning students safely to campus\"); America's Frontline Doctors No. 21-EDCV-1243, Dist. LEXIS 144477 (C.D. Cal. July 30, 2021) (holding that \"there is clearly a rational basis for Defendants to institute the Policy requiring vaccination\" to further the goal of facilitating the \"protection of the health and safety of the University community,\" where the policy was \"the product of consultation with UC infections disease experts and ongoing review of evidence from medical studies concerning the dangerousness of COVID-19 and emerging variants of concern, as well as the safety and effectiveness of the vaccines\"). Applying Jacobson to the PHO's vaccine mandate, the Court reaches the same conclusion. Case 1:21-cv-00783-MV-JHR Document 18 Filed 09/13/21 Page 16 of 30 APLT Page: 46 -17 The governmental purpose of stemming the spr ead of COVID-19, especially in the wake of the Delta variant, is not only legitimate, but is \"unquestionably a compelling interest.\" Roman Cath. Diocese of Brooklyn , 141 S. Ct. at 67. Other legitimate goals follow from that, including: (1) protecting \"persons who may be extremely vuln erable to the virus an d at high risk for poor outcomes,\" \"children younger than 12 years\" who are not el igible for vaccination, and \"individuals who are not able to get vaccinated du e to a contraindication . . . or persons who may be severely immunocompromised and not able to mount an effective immune response to the vaccine\"; and (2) \"significantly reduc[ing] the tr ansmission of this virus from person to person\" in order to \"decrease the likeli hood\" of \"new mutations in the viral genome that could possibly lead to more severe disease or even the abil ity to evade the current vaccines and anti-viral therapeutics.\" Doc. 13-1 \u00b6\u00b6 14, 20-21, 26. Following the researc h, recommendations, and guidance of several medical and scientific sources, including the CDC, the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American Academy of Family Practice, the Infectious Diseases Society of America, the New Mexico state public health lab, University of Ne w Mexico, Los Alamos National Lab, and the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices , Defendants have determined that the three vaccines - which ar e \"extremely safe\" and, even against the Delta variant, \"highly effective\" - \"are the best to ol we have to protect individuals and protect communities from [COVID-19].\" Doc. 13-1 \u00b6\u00b6 15, 28. Notably, based on the scientific and medical research, Defendants have determined th at vaccinating health car e personnel is the \"best tool\" to protect patients who come into close contact with th em - patients who \"may be extremely vulnerable to the virus an d at high risk for poor outcomes.\" Id. \u00b6 14. Similarly, Defendants have determined that \"the most effective way to stop transmission both to children younger than 12 years\" and to \"individuals who are not able to get vaccina ted\" \"is to vaccinate Case 1:21-cv-00783-MV-JHR Document 18 Filed 09/13/21 Page 17 of 30 APLT Page: 47 -App. 87 -18 eligible family members and those in the community where they live.\" Id. \u00b6\u00b6 20-21. Further, Defendants have determined that \"[t]he best tool we have\" to decrease the likelihood that new, more lethal mutations of the virus develop \"is through protecting as many people as possible by vaccination.\" Id. \u00b6 26. Finally, Defendants have deter mined that \"the immunity provided by vaccines may be more long-lasting compared to immunity gained following infection.\" Id. \u00b6 39. The vaccination requirements set forth in the PHO, thus grounded in medicine and science, are rationally related to Defendants' legitimate purpo se of protecting our community \"against an epidemic of disease [that] threatens the safety of its members.\" Jacobson, 197 U.S. at 27. As was smallpox in 1905, COVID-19 is \"pre valent to some extent\" in New Mexico and, because of the Delta variant, \"t he disease [is] increasing.\" Id. Since Jacobson was decided, the \"methods employed to stamp out\" diseases have continued to include vaccination, which, \"as a means of protecting a community against smallp ox [other diseases, and now, COVID-19], finds strong support in the experience of this a nd other countries.\" Id. Accordingly, no one could \"confidently assert that the means prescribed by the state to prevent the spread of COVID-19,\" namely, requiring certain individual s to be vaccinated, have \"no real or substantial relation to the protection of the public health and the public safety.\" Id. at 31. It follows that the PHO was \"enacted in a reasonable and proper exer cise of [Defendant s'] police power.\" Id. at 35. Indeed, \"this case is easier than Jacobson,\" as \"Jacobson sustained a vaccination requirement that lacked exceptions for adults,\" while the PHO has medical , disability, and religi ous belief exemptions, and \"does not require every adult member of the public to be vaccinated, as Massachusetts did in Jacobson,\" but rather is targeted to those individuals most likely to impact vulnerable populations. Klaassen II , 7 F.4th at 593. Case 1:21-cv-00783-MV-JHR Document 18 Filed 09/13/21 Page 18 of 30 APLT PHO as \"tech nocratic selective scie nce,\" and argue that it fails to take into account that \"Covid-recovere d individuals have equal to or better immunity response than vaccinated individuals.\" Doc. 14 at 2; Doc. 1 \u00b6 13. But Plaintiffs' \"disputes over the most reliable science\" are of no moment to the instant analysis, as \"the court doesn't intervene so long as [Defendants'] process is rational in trying to achieve public health.\" Klaassen I , 2021 WL 3073926, at * 38 (citing Phillips v. City of New York, 775 F.3d 538, 542 (2d Cir. 2015) (\"[P]laintiffs ar gue that a growing body of scientif ic evidence demonstrates that vaccines cause more harm to society than good, but as Jacobson makes clear, that is a determination for the [policymaker], not the i ndividual objectors.\")). As did the Court in Jacobson , this Court assumes that Defendants are aw are of \"opposing theori es\" on the safety and efficacy of vaccines; and as did the Court in Jacobson , this Court finds, as it must, that it is for Defendants, and not the Court, to determine what \"[is] likely to be the most effective [mode] for the protection of the public against disease.\" Jacobson, 197 U.S. at 30. Indeed, this is so regardless of whether \"science may yet show\" Defe ndants' belief in the efficacy of the COVID- 19 vaccines \"to be wrong,\" as Defendants have the right to enact orders \"adapted to prevent the spread of contagious diseases.\" Id. Plaintiffs also contend that the PHO represen ts an \"offensive disreg ard for the civil rights of the unvaccinated to make their own decision about what to put in their bodies trusting the science they think is best and their own doctors to decide for themselves what is best for them.\" Doc. 14 at 3. But the Jacobson Court made clear that the Four teenth Amendment does not grant individuals any such rights in the face of a state-imposed vaccine mandate. To the contrary, the Court explicitly refused to \"hold it to be an el ement in the liberty secured by the Constitution of the United States that one person, or a minority of persons, residing in any community and Case 1:21-cv-00783-MV-JHR Document 18 Filed 09/13/21 Page 19 of 30 APLT Page: enjoying the benefits of its loca l government\" should have the pow er [] to dominate the majority by \"defy[ing] the will of its c onstituted authorities , acting in good faith for all, under the legislative sanction of the state.\" Jacobson, 197 U.S. at 38. In short, by failing to accommodate Plaintiffs' (or their doctors') vi ews on the COVID-19 vaccines, the PHO does not lack a rational relationship to a legitimate govern ment purpose. Indeed, to hold otherwise would \"practically strip [Defendants] of [their] f unction to care for the public hea lth and the public safety when endangered by epidemic s of disease.\" Id. at 37. For these reasons, the PHO meets the rational basis test. Accordingly, Plaintiffs are unlikely to succeed on the merits of their substantive due process claims. C. Equal Protection Claims Plaintiffs allege that Defenda nts are violating their equal pr otection rights because their \"actions create a class of individuals who . . . are punished for being unvaccinated and discriminated against without any real justif iable basis and without providing them any alternative,\" and \"[t]he PHO is not rationally related to achieving a compelling government purpose.\" Doc. 1 \u00b6\u00b6 59, 60 (emphasis in original). \"Equal protection is essentially a direction that all persons similarly situated should be treated alike.\" Dalton v. Reynolds, 2 F.4th 1300, 1308 (10th Cir. 2021) (citation omitted ). \"In order to assert a vi able equal protection claim, plaintiffs must first make a threshold showing th at they were treated differently from others who were similarly situated to them.\" Barney v. Pulsipher , 143 F.3d 1299, 1312 (10th Cir. 1998)). \"Upon this showing, [plaintiffs] must then demonstrate that the state acto r's differential treatment of [them] cannot pass the a ppropriate standard of scrutiny.\" Dalton, 2 F.4th at 1308. \"Different types of equal pr otection claims call for diff erent forms of review.\" Id. \"[U]nless a legislative cl assification either burdens a fundamental right or targets a suspect class, Case 1:21-cv-00783-MV-JHR Document 18 Filed 09/13/21 Page 20 of 30 APLT Page: 50 -App. -21 it need only bear a rational re lation to some legitimate end to comport with equal protection.\" Curley v. Perry , 246 F.3d 1278, 1285 (10th Cir. 2001) (citati on omitted). As discussed above, the PHO does not burden a fundamental right. Nor does it target a su spect class, as it does not \"categorize persons based on suspect classifications , such as race and national origin,\" or \"on 'quasi-suspect' classifications, su ch as gender FruitLands v. Todd, 279 F.3d 1204, 1210 (10th Cir. 2002) (citations om itted). Accordingly, the Court applies rational basis review, asking \"whe ther the government's classificat ion bears a rational relation to some legitimate end.\" Dalton, 2 F.4th at 1308. As explained above in the context of Plaint iffs' substantive due pr ocess claims, the PHO meets the rational basis test. Th e PHO, including its classificati on of individuals as to whom vaccination requirements apply, is grounded in medicine and science, and thus is rationally related to Defendants' legitimate purpose of protecting our community \"against an epidemic of disease [that] threatens the safety of its members.\" Jacobson, 197 U.S. at 27. Accordingly, Plaintiffs are unlikely to succeed on the me rits of their equa l protection claims. D. Procedural Due Process Claims Plaintiffs allege that the PHO deprives them of \"fundamental liberties without due process of law.\" Doc. 1 \u00b6 73. Because the P HO, however, \"is generally applicable\" to all congregate care facility workers, hospital worker s, school workers, State Fair attendees, and Governor's office staff, Plai ntiffs \"are not enti tled to [process] above and beyond the notice provided by the enactment and publi cation of the also United States v. Locke , 471 U.S. 84, 108 (1985) (\"In altering substantive rights throug h enactment of rules of general a pplicability, a legislature generally provides constitutionally adequate process simply by enacting the statute, publishing it, and, to Case 1:21-cv-00783-MV-JHR Document 18 Filed 09/13/21 Page 21 of 30 APLT Page: 51 -App. 91 -22 the extent the statute regulate s private conduct, affording thos e within the statute's reach a reasonable opportunity both to familiarize them selves with the general requirements imposed and to comply with those requirements.\"); Oklahoma Educ. Ass'n v. Alcoholic Beverage Laws Enforcement Comm'n , 889 F.2d 929, 936 (10th Cir. 1989) (\"Wh en the legislature passes a law which affects a general class of persons, those pe rsons have all received procedural due process - the legislative process.\"); Curlott v. Campbell , 598 F.2d 1175, 1181 (9th Cir. 1979) (\"[W]e doubt very much that procedural due process prior to re duction of benefits is required when an agency makes a broadly applicable, legislat ive-type decision.\"). Based on this principle, courts in this district have held that the public health orders issued by Defendants in response to the current pandemic do not implicate pr ocedural due process. See Hernandez v. Lujan 3d at 1197-98. This Court agrees. Accordingly, Plaintiffs are unlikely to succeed on the merits of their procedural due process claims. E. Claims under Article I, Section 10 of the United States Constitution Plaintiffs allege that Defendants' vaccine re quirements \"constitute[] a bill of attainder\" and \"impair\" the contract entered into between Valdez and her children \"to participate in the New Mexico State Fair junior livestock competitions\" and Blackford's \"employment contract,\" in violation of Article I, Secti on 10 of the United States Constitution. Doc. 1 \u00b6\u00b6 75-76. In their reply brief, Plaintiffs appear to abandon their theory that the PHO constitutes a bill of attainder, referring to Defendants' arguments refuting that theory as \"a co mplete red herring.\" Doc. 14 at 7. Accordingly, the Court will consider only Pl aintiffs' remaining argu ment under the Contracts Clause of Article I, Section 10 of the United States Constitution, namely that Defendants have impaired Plaintiffs' existing c ontracts by enacting the PHO. Id. at 8-9. Case 1:21-cv-00783-MV-JHR Document 18 Filed 09/13/21 Page 22 of 30 APLT \"The Contracts Clause restricts the power of States to disrupt contractual arrang ements.\" Sveen v. Melin , 138 S. Ct. provides pass Law impairing the Obligation of Contracts.\" Id. (quoting U.S. Const., Art. I, \u00a7 10, cl. 1). Not all laws affecting pre-existing cont racts, however, violate the Clause. Sveen , 138 S. Ct. at 1821. The Supreme articulated a \"two -step test\" to determine \"when such a law crosses the constitutional line.\" Id. First, the Court asks whether the state law has \"operated as a substantial impairment of a contractual relationship.\" Id. at 1822. In answering that question, the Court considers \"the extent to which the law undermines the contra ctual bargain, interferes with a party's reasonable expectations, and prev ents the party from safe guarding or reinstating his rights.\" Id. \"If such factors show a substantial impai rment,\" the Court next asks \"whether the state law is drawn in an 'a ppropriate' and 'reas onable' way to advance 'a significant and legitimate public purpose.'\" Id. (quoting Energy Reserves Group, Inc. v. Kansas Power & Light Co., 459 U.S. 400, 411-412 (1983)). Here, Plaintiffs have failed to establish a \"substantial impairment\" of any contractual relationship. Plaintiffs have not provided the Court with copies of any of the purported contracts at issue or cited to any provi sions therein to demonstrate that the PHO undermines their contractual bargain, interferes with their reasonable expecta tions, or prevents them from safeguarding or reinstating thei r rights. And indeed, the ev idence available to the Court demonstrates to the contrary. First, as Plaintiffs concede, Blackford's employer, Presbyterian, has instituted its own private vaccine mandate - a manda te that reaches more broadl y than does the PHO - requiring its entire workforce to be vaccinated against COVID-19 in the absence of a qualifying exemption. Colleen Heild, Presbyterian requires vaccines for entire workforce of 13,000 , Santa Case 1:21-cv-00783-MV-JHR Document 18 Filed 09/13/21 Page 23 of 30 APLT Page: was implemented simply so that Blackford's \"employer can remain compliant with the [] PHO,\" Doc. 14 at 8, but there is no support for this contention, as the PHO applies dire ctly to individual worker s rather than to the hospitals that employ them. Nor is there any indication that, but for the PHO, Presbyterian would not have instituted its own vaccine requi rements. Notably, commenting on its mandate, Presbyterian's president and CEO, Dale Maxwell, stated, \"We take care of some of the most vulnerable people in the state of New Mexico, . . . and I believ e . . . we should take every measure possible to deliver the safest environment.\" Id. Maxwell further stated that Presbyterian made its own independent decisi on \"to also include a ll other Presbyterian employees, including clini cal, clerical and health plan em ployees,\" because \"we believe at Presbyterian that vaccines are the best way to co mbat this pandemic . . . We know that vaccines reduce the spread of the infecti on and we know that vaccines re duce the illness of those that contract COVID-19. Any action to increase vaccines in our community, we support.\" Id. Thus, Blackford has no \"reasonable expectation\" th at she would be enti tled to continue her employment without being vaccinated, and thus ca nnot claim that the PHO substantially impairs her contractual rights. Similarly, while Plaintiffs allege that Vald ez has been deprived of the benefit of her contract with Expo New Mexico because her ch ildren cannot participate in the New Mexico State Fair junior livestock competitions, Expo New Mexico cancelled the 2021 New Mexico State Fair Junior Livestock Shows and Sale. See New Mexico State Fair website, https:// statefair.exponm.com/p/participate/competitions/livestock-shows . The website indicates that Case 1:21-cv-00783-MV-JHR Document 18 Filed 09/13/21 Page 24 of 30 APLT Expo New Mexico is \"issuing full re funds of all fees to our exhi bitors,\" and provides a form on its website for individuals who had contracted to attend to ma ke their request for a refund. Id. Because Valdez thus is entitled to a refund of the consideration that she paid for her children to participate in the State Fair, the PHO does not un dermine her contractual bargain. Further, she and her children will still be able to show their animals, as the New Mexico Youth Livestock Expo is going forward in Roswell, welcoming a ll entries free of charge and in an unlimited number. See New Mexico Youth Livestock Expo Facebook page, https: //www.facebook.com/NMJLF1989/photos/pb.181295355267698.2207520000../4601143193282 870/?type=3&theater . The fact that they may exhibit th eir animals in the New Mexico Youth Livestock Expo negates Plaintiffs' claim that th e PHO has \"fully removed the ability of these children to participate.\" Doc. 14 at 8. Even if Plaintiffs were able to show a substantial impairment of a contractual relationship, their cla im under the Contracts Clause would fa il because, just as it meets the rational basis test, the PHO is drawn in an appropriate and reasonable way to advance a significant and legitimate public purpose. For th ese reasons, Plaintiffs are unlikely to succeed on the merits of their claims that the PHO violates the Contracts Clause of Article I, Section 10 of the United States Constitution. F. State Constitutional Claims Plaintiffs allege that, by re quiring individuals to be vacci nated \"to maintain employment or enjoy the benefits of an ex isting contract,\" Defendants are vi olating Plaintiffs' rights \"secured by the New Mexico Constitution,\" and that such violation \"is actionable under the New Mexico Civil Rights Act [(\"NMCRA\")].\" Doc. 1 \u00b6\u00b6 81, 86. \"The eleventh amendment generally bars lawsuits in federal court seeking damages against states as well as against state agencies, Case 1:21-cv-00783-MV-JHR Document 18 Filed 09/13/21 Page 25 of 30 APLT departments, and employees acting in their official capacity.\" Bishop v. John Doe 1 , 902 F.2d 809, 810 (10th Cir. 1990). Nonetheless, a state \"may waive its eleventh amendment immunity and consent to suit against itself, related entities and employees.\" Id. Under the NMCRA, the state of New Mexico has waived sovereign immun ity \"for itself or any public body within the state for claims brought pursuant to the New Me xico Civil Rights Act.\" N.M. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 41- 4A-9. This waiver, however, is limited to ac tions commenced in \"any New Mexico district court.\" N.M. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 41-4A-3. The Tenth Ci rcuit has interpreted an alogous language in the New Mexico Tort Claims Act (\"NMTCA\") to m ean that a plaintiff cannot \"pursue [a] claim against [a state public body] and its employees acting within the scope of their employment in the federal district court, but rather is relegated to the state district court to seek relief consistent with the limited waiver of im munity under [the NMTCA].\" Bishop, 902 F.2d at 810. Here, Defendants invoke eleventh amendmen t immunity and argue that, because the NMCRA waives immunity only as to actions commenced in New Mexico state court, Plaintiffs may not pursue their New Mexico constitutional claims, brought pursuant to the NMCRA, in this Court. Doc. 13 at 32. In response, Plaintiffs argue that this Court nonetheless has pendent jurisdiction over their NMCRA claims. Doc. 14 at 9-10. This Court has c onsidered and rejected that argument in the analogous context of the NM TCA as \"incorrect as a matter of law.\" Quarrie v. New Mexico Inst. of Mining & Tech., No. 13-cv-349, 2014 WL 11456598, at *2 (D.N.M. Feb. 25, 2014). As the Quarrie Court explained, \"immunity under the Eleventh Amendment is not abrogated by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 13 67, and therefore, \u00a7 1367 does not authorize federal district courts to exercise jurisdiction over claims against nonconsenting states.\" Id. (citing Raygor v. Regents of Univ. of Minnesota , 534 U.S. 533, 542 (2002) (holding that \"\u00a7 1367(a)'s grant of jurisdiction does not ex tend to claims against nonconsenting state Case 1:21-cv-00783-MV-JHR Document 18 Filed 09/13/21 Page 26 of 30 APLT -27 defendants\")). Plaintiffs have pointed to no contrary authority to suggest that Defendants have lost the right to invoke eleventh amendment immun ity solely because this Court otherwise would have supplemental jurisdiction over their NMCRA claims. Because Plaintiffs are unable to seek a deci sion on the merits of their NMCRA claims in this Court, they necessarily are unlikely to succeed on the merits of those claims. * * * Accordingly, Plaintiffs have fa iled to prove that they are \"sub stantially likely to succeed on the merits\" of any of their claims. Free the Nipple, 916 F.3d at 797. Because Plaintiffs \"must\" satisfy their burden as to each factor of the preliminary injunction test, Plaintiffs' failure to satisfy their burden as to th e likelihood of success factor is al one fatal to th eir request for preliminary injunctive relief. Peterson, 492 F. Supp. 3d at 1192. Nonetheless, the Court will consider the remaining factors of the preliminary injunction test. II. Irreparable Harm Plaintiffs argue that, because the PHO \"bur den[s] if not outright den[ies]\" their due process and equal protection rights, the irreparable harm standard is met. Doc. 1 at 23. But \"[a]s explained in the preceding sect ions, [Plaintiffs have] failed to demonstrate the requisite likelihood of success\" on their cons titutional claims and, \"[a]s a resu lt, [they are] not entitled to a presumption of irreparable injury.\" Schrier, 427 F.3d at 1266. Accordingly, to satisfy the irreparable ha rm prong of the preliminary injunction test, Plaintiffs must show that they stand to suffer \"an injury\" that is \"cert ain, great, actual, and not theoretical.\" Id. at 1267 (citation omitted). \"Merely serious or substantia l harm is not irreparable harm.\" Id. (citation omitted). Further, \"the party seeking injunctive relief must show that the injury complained of is of such imminence that there is a clear and pr esent need for equitable Case 1:21-cv-00783-MV-JHR Document 18 Filed 09/13/21 Page 27 of 30 APLT to prevent irreparable harm.\" Id. (citation omitted). Importantly, \"[i]t is [] well settled that simple economic loss usually does not, in and of itself, constitute irreparable harm; such losses are compensable by monetary damages.\" Id. (citation omitted). Similarly, \"[a] permanent loss of employment, standing alone, does not equate to irreparable harm.\" E. St. Louis Laborers' Loc. 100 v. Bellon Wrecking & Salvage Co. , 414 F.3d 700, 704 (7th Cir. 2005). Plaintiffs claim that \"[t]here is no adequate legal remedy for [their] intangible harms,\" namely, \"being terminated from their employ ment and from engagi ng in their chosen profession.\" Doc. 1 at 23. But, as discussed above, any harm to Blackford caused by her potential termination and/or inability to continue to work as a nurse is a function not of the PHO but rather of her employer's own vaccine manda te. And indeed, even if that harm were attributable to the PHO, being so terminated/pre vented from working as a nurse does not equate to irreparable harm. Similarly, Valdez cannot establish any harm from the PHO, because, as discussed above, Expo New Mexico ha s offered to refund all fees pa id to participate in the New Mexico State Fair Junior Livestock Shows and Sale, and Valdez and her children may enter, at no cost, the New Mexico Youth Livestock Expo. Furt her, Plaintiffs have failed to establish that any loss to Valdez resulting from the PHO is not compensable by monetary damages. Plaintiffs thus have failed to establish that th ey will suffer irreparable harm if the PHO is not enjoined. III. Balance of Harms Plaintiffs contend that \"the balance of harm s tips decidedly in fa vor of Plaintiff[s],\" because, if an injunction is granted, \"Defendants will suffer [only] speculative harm,\" but if an injunction is not granted, Plaintiffs will suffer \"an injury to [their] [constitutional] rights.\" Doc. 1 at 24. As the Court has already explained, Plaintiffs are unlikely to su cceed on the merits of Case 1:21-cv-00783-MV-JHR Document 18 Filed 09/13/21 Page 28 of 30 APLT their constitutional claims. Accord ingly, the threatened harm that Plaintiffs seek to prevent does not reach a constitutional magnitude. Nor can the Court agree that any harm to Defendants can be so easily minimized as \"speculative.\" To the contrary, the Court finds that \"the balance of equities tips in Defenda nts' favor given the strong public in terest here they are promoting - preventing further spread of COVID-19 [], a viru s [that] has infected and taken the lives of thousands of relief here would weaken the efforts of [Defendants] to carry out those goals.\" Id. \"Similarly, given the public health efforts promoted by the [PHO], enjoining the continuation of same is not in the public interest.\" Id. The Court thus finds that Plai ntiffs have failed to estab lish that the balance of harms weighs in their favor or that granting the requested in junction would not be adverse to the public interest. See ETP Rio Rancho Park , 2021 WL 765364, at *57 (holding that \"the threatened injuries - financial injuries and possible permanent business cl osure - do not outweigh possible damage - increased COVID-19 spre ad leading to sickness, hospitalizations, and death - to the Defendants,\" and \"for similar reasons,\" the reque sted injunction \"would be adverse to the public interest\"). CONCLUSION To obtain preliminary injunctive relief, Plai ntiffs are required to prove that they are substantially likely to succeed on the merits of their claims, that they will suffer irreparable injury if the Court denies the requested injuncti on, that the balance of harms weighs in their favor, and that the injunction woul d not be adverse to the public in terest. As set forth above, Plaintiffs fail to satisfy their burden as to any, let alone all, of these factors. Accordingly, Plaintiffs are not entitled to an order enjoining the PHO.

Blair Dunn, Esq. WESTERN AGRICULTURE, RESOURCE AND BUSINESS ADVOCATES, LLP 400 Gold Ave SW, Suite 1000 lbuquerque, NM 87102 (505) 750 -3060 -App. 101 -2 INTRODUCTION This Motion is made pursuant to this Court's jurisdict ion to hear immediate appeals of denials of preliminary injunctions. In this case, the District Court has jurisdiction under 42 U.S.C . Section 1983 to hear the claims that Appellants brought concerning violations of constitutional rights and an application was first made to the District Court following the denial of the requested preliminary injunction for a stay and injunction pending t his appeal which was denied for the reasons stated in the decision found in the concurrently filed appendix ( Aplt App 199 -228), but summarized here as being denied as matter of law that, based on the facts as presented by Appellants, that they did not demo nstrate a substantial likelihood of success on the merits, irreparable harm, or that the balance of harms weighed in favor of an injunction. Because it appeared imminent that the District Court would like ly rule on a pending F.R.C.P Rule 12(b) (6) to dismis s this case, Appellant s have delay ed filing the instant motion and have instead elected to file the instant motion contemporaneously with the Opening Brief and Appendix in this matter. Like the District Court's Order, the Declaration of Appellant Jennifer Blackford that w as presented to the District Court and upon which Appellant relies for the instant request are found in the Appendix ( Aplt App 054 -055), -App. 102 -3 THE FACTORS ARE SATISFIED FOR THE GRANTING OF INJUNCTIVE RELIEF PENDING APPEAL As set forth in 10th Cir. R. 8 .1, a plaintiff seeking an injunction while an appeal is pending before this Court under Fed. R. App. P. 8(a)(1)(C); see also Fed. R. App. P. 8(a)(2), \"requires the applicant to address the following: (a) the likelihood of success on appeal; (b) the threat of irreparable harm if the stay or injunction is not granted; (c) the absence of harm to opposing parties if the stay or injunction is granted; and (d) any risk of harm to the public interest. In ruling on such a request, this court makes the same inquiry as it would when reviewing a district court's grant or denial of a preliminary injunction. Homans v. City of Albuquerque , 264 F.3d 1240, 1243 (10th Cir. 2001) .1 As set forth in d etail, in the contemporaneously filed Opening Brief, Appellants satisfy each of the four factors for this Court to issue a preliminary injunction pending this Court 's resolution of appeal of the District Court's denial of preliminary injunction and incorpo rates fully the arguments, citations and recitations of the Opening Brief herein as stated regarding these factors. 1 Plaintiffs satisfied Rule 8(a)(1)'s requirement to \"move first in the district court for . . . an order . . . granting an in junction,\" by first requesting this very preliminary injunction from that court and then by subsequently filing a motion for relief pending appeal . Appellate PRELIMINARY RELIEF REQUESTE D Appellants request that the Appellees be prevent from enforcing the PHO order at issue in this matter during the pendency of th is appeal and a stay of the matter before the district court while this appeal is pending . Conclusion For all the foregoing reasons, Appellants ' motion for a preliminary injunction pending appeal should be granted.

Rev. 302, 305 (2018) ....................................................42 STATEMENT OF PRIOR OR RELATED APPEALS There are no prior or related appeals. Appellate Case: 21-2105 OF THE CASE This interlocutory appeal represents yet another attempt to have the courts overturn elected officials' constitutional measures enacted to protect lives and safety during an unprecedented pandemic. In an effort to stem the rapid resurgence of a highly contagious and potentially more lethal variant of the virus that causes COVID -19, Defendants issued a public health order requiring individuals working with New Mexico's most vulnerable populations in hospitals and congregate care settings to receive a safe and effective vaccine \u2014one of which is now fully approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration \u2014or meet a health, disability, or religious exemption. Defendants also required all vaccine -eligible individuals to show proof of vaccination or entitlement to an exemption to attend the (now over) New Mexico State Fair. Unfortunately, not everyone agrees with the science. Those disagreements, however, do not give rise to a justiciable dispute. As Justice Cardozo eloq uently observed, \"The right of private judgment has never yet been so exalted above the powers and the compulsion of the agencies of government. One who is a martyr to a principle \u2014which may turn out in the end to be a delusion or an error \u2014does not prove by his martyrdom that he has kept within the law.\" Hamilton v. Regents of Univ. of Cal. , 293 U.S. 245, 268 (1934). Plaintiffs\u2014 two individuals subject to the vaccine requirements and apparently not entitled to an exemption \u2014seek to halt Appellate -Defendants' carefully calculated life -saving measures based on their (faulty and speculative) belief that the vaccines are neither safe nor necessary. But such minority views are insufficient to defeat the wisdom of elected officials guided by the State and nation's preeminent public health experts. As the U.S. Supreme Court proclaimed over a century ago , We are not prepared to hold that a minority, residing or remaining in any city or town where [a deadly, contagious virus] is prevalent, and enjoying the general protection afforded by an organized local government, may thus defy the will of its constituted authorities, acting in good faith for all, under the legislative sanction of the State. If such be the privilege of a minority then a like privilege would belong to each individual of the community, and the spectacle would be presented of the welfare and safety of an entire population being subordinated to the notions of a single individual who chooses to remain a part of that population. Jacobson v. Massachuset ts, 197 U.S. 11, 37- 38 (1905). Plaintiffs (who no longer have standing to pursue injunctive relief) give this Court no reason to conclude otherwise or find an abuse of discretion in the denial of preliminary injunctive relief . STATEMENT OF THE ISSUES 1. Did the district court abuse its discretion in denying Plaintiffs' request for a preliminary injunction? STATEMENT OF THE CASE I. The rapid and dangerous spread of COVID- 19 Since its emergence last year, the novel coronavirus 2019 (Sars- CoV -2), the virus that causes COVID-19, has spread exponentially across the globe, throughout Appellate States, and here in New Mexico.1 COVID -19's rapid spread is attributable to certain ch aracteristics of the virus that causes it and the ease with which that virus is transmitted. COVID- 19 is a respiratory illness that causes severe complications in some patients, including respiratory failure, organ failure, and death.2 Like most respiratory illnesses, COVID -19 spreads easily through close person- to-person contact, and the risk of transmission increases if individuals interact with more people, come within six feet of one another, and spend longer periods of time together.3 Although it has not been measured precisely, a significant portion of COVID-19 cases result in mild symptoms or no symptoms.4 Additionally, even in cases that are symptomatic, the average time from exposure to symptom onset is five to six days, with symptoms sometimes n ot appearing until as long as 1 See Appellants' Appendix (Aplt. App.) at 99 \u00b6\u00b6 4- 5. 2 See Aplt.

The ease and rapidity with which COVID- 19 spreads and its severe and sometimes fatal symptoms in a certain percentage of the population create a potential for mass deaths and a severely overloaded health care system. At the height of the pandemic (so far) last winter, the United States was recording on average nearly 200,000 new cases and over 4,000 COVID-related deaths every day.6 New Mexico was averaging over 2,500 new cases and over 40 deaths daily.7 The Department of 5 COVID-19 Basics: Symptoms, Spread and Other Essential Information About the New Coronavirus and COVID -19, Harvard Medical School (March 2 020), https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and -conditions/covid -19-basics. 6 Trends in Number of COVID-19 Cases and Deaths in the US Reported to CDC, by State/Territory , Ctr. for Disease Control and Prevention, https://covid.cdc.gov/covid -data-tracker/ (last visited Nov . 20, 2021); Trends in Number of COVID -19 Cases and Deaths in the US Reported to CDC, by State/Territory , Ctr. for Disease Control and Prevention, https://covid.cdc.gov/covid -data-tracker/#trends_dailydeaths (last visite d Nov. 20, 2021 ). 7 Trends in Number of COVID-19 Cases and Deaths in the US Reported to CDC, by State/Territory , Ctr. for Disease Control and Prevention, https://covid.cdc.gov/covid -data-tracker/#trends_dailycases (follow \"New Mexico\" on drop down menu) (last visited Nov. 20, 2021 ); Trends in Number of COVID-19 Cases and Deaths in the US Reported to CDC, by State/Territory , Ctr. for Disease Control and Prevention, https://covid.cdc.gov/covid -data- tracker/#trends_dailydeaths (follow \"New Mexico\" on drop down -Health had to activate crisis standards of care because hospitals were literally overflowing with patients.8 Tragically, hospitals were not the only things at capacity. One in five New Mexicans hospitalized for COVID-19 eventually succumbed to the virus\u2014 leaving morgues inundated as well .9 II. The development of the COVID -19 vaccines Thankfully, science came to the rescue. In February 2020, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) declared a public health emergency and instructed the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to grant emergency use authorizations (EUAs) for medical devices and interventions to combat the pandemic. See 85 Fed. Reg. 7316, 7317 (Feb. 7, 2020) ; 85 Fed. Reg. 18250, 18251 (Mar. 27, 2020). While an EUA generally allows a manufacturer to receive approval for a medical product using only interim clinical trial data, products that receive EUA approval still must adhere to specified safety, efficacy, and 8 Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham, Executive Order 2020 -083, at 4 (Dec. 4, 2020), https://www.governor.state.nm.us/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Executive -Order - 2020 -083.pdf (executive order preparing for implementation of crisis care standards); N.M.

Specifically with regard to the development of a COVID -19 vaccine, the FDA issued detailed guidance to manufacturers and specifically informed them that it would require a determination that the vaccine's benefits outweigh its risks based on data from at least one well-designed Phase 3 clinical trial that demonstrates the vaccine's safety and efficacy in a clear and compelling manner.10 Numerous man ufacturers rose to the occasion, and three vaccines candidates quickly emerged as frontrunners: Johnson & Johnson's single-dose viral vector vaccine, and Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna's two- dose mRNA vaccines.11 By the time Pfizer and Moderna applied for EUA status in November 2020, each vaccine had undergone significant testing. Pfizer's application included safety, 10 Aplt.

The FDA granted EUA to Pfizer and Moderna's vaccines in December 2020 and J&J's vaccine in February 2021 for individuals ages 16 and older, noting that each had met their expectations set out in the FDA's comprehensive guidance.15 Pfizer's vaccine has since received EUA for individuals ages 12 and older and received full FDA approval for individuals ages 16 and over on August 23, 2021.16 Despite the unprecedented timeline for development, the vaccines have been a resounding success. Since the three vaccines received EUA status, hundreds of million s of doses have been admi nistered. See Aplt.

App. at 105 \u00b6 2 7 n.19. III. The emergence of the Delta variant Unfortunately, a highly infectious and possibly more deadly variant has emerged and taken the world by storm. B.1.617.2, commonly known as the \"Delta\" variant was first discovered in India in late 2020 and soon became the predominant strain in that country.19 By mid -June, the CDC labeled Delta a \"variant of concern.\"20 Now, it is widely estimated that the Delta variant accounts for nearly all of new infections in the United States and New Mexico, and is believed to be at least twice as contagious as previous variants. See Aplt. App. at 103 -04 \u00b6\u00b6 22 & n.13 , 24-25 & n.16-18.

See id. at 104 \u00b6 24 n.17. In terms of the variant's impact on vaccines, there is bad news and good news: while the variant is more likely to cause \"breakthrough\" infections, the vaccines still provide strong protection against serious illness and death. See id. at 105 \u00b6 28 & n.20. For example, one recent analysis of over 40,000 infections in Los Angeles from May to the end of July found that vaccinated individuals were nearly 5 times less likely to become infected and nearly 30 times less likely to require hospitalization . Id. at 105 \u00b6 27 n.19. IV. New Mexico's public health emergency orders and the current state of the pandemic Recognizing the seriousness of this virus and its ability to spread exponentially through close contacts and public spaces, the Governor declared a public health emergency under the Public Health Emergency Response Act, NMSA 1978, \u00a7\u00a7 12- 10A-1 to -19 (2003, as amended through 2015), and invoked the All Hazards Emergency Management Act, NMSA 1978, \u00a7\u00a7 12-10 -1 to - 10 (1959, as amended through 2007), by directing all cabinets, departments, and agencies to comply with the directives of the declaration and the fur ther instructions of the Department of Health. 21 Consistent with the powers provided during an emergency 21 Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham, Executive Order 2020 -under the Public Health Emergency Response Act and the All Hazards Emergency Management Act, as well as the Public Health Act, NMSA 1978, \u00a7\u00a7 24-1- 1 to - 40 (1973, as amended through 2019), the Secretary subsequently entered a series of public health orders (\"PHOs\").22 The PHOs initially included various measures such as limiting most public and private gatherings of any significant size and curtailing the operations of many businesses. Id. However, the PHOs' restrictions were largely phased out as case rates dropped dramatically with New Mexico's efficient rollout of the COVID- 19 vaccines that began earlier this year. 23 Unfortunately, cases again climbed rapidly in the early fall with the spread of the Delta variant. The number of new cases rose from a n average of approximately 60 cases per day in late June to nearly 900 cases per day in late August when Plaintiffs filed this action \u2014almost a fifteenfold 2020 - 004.pdf.

He also reported that 87 percent of Presbyterian's COVID- 19 patients are unvaccinated. Id.

The challenged vaccine mandate To stem the recent surge of cases and ease the pressures on New Mexico hospitals, the Secretary issued a PHO on August 17, 2021, generally requiring individuals working in hospitals and certain congregate care facilities to receive their first dose of a COVID- 19 vaccine within 10 days and their second dose (for Pfizer and Moderna) within 40 days of their first dose.30 However, such workers are not required to get a vaccine if they have a: (1) qualifying medical condition for which immunization would endanger the individual's health, (2) disability requiring reasonable accommodations, or (3) sincerely held religious b elief against vaccination. Id. at 4. To qualify for the first and second exemptions, the individual must provide their employer with a statement from a licensed medical professional stating that the individual has a qualifying medical condition or disability that necessitates accommodation an d stating the probable duration of the individual's inability to receive the vaccine or need for an accommodation.

This requirement also applies to employees from the Office of the Governor. Id. However, everyone within the Office of the Governor is vaccinated. Additionall y, the PHO requires school workers to either provide proof of their vaccination status or undergo weekly COVID -19 testing, id. at 3, but Plaintiffs do not assert any claims on behalf of teachers because they are not required to receive the vaccine. See Aplt. App. at 12 \u00b6\u00b6 -exemption, the individual must document their request for an accommodation and provide a statement regarding the manner in which the administration of a COVID- 19 vaccine conflicts with their religious observance, practice, or belief. Id. at 4-5. Individuals who meet an exemption must undergo weekly COVID- 19 testing. Id. In addition to the above requirements, the PHO requires all individuals attending the New Mexico State Fair that are eligible to receive a COVID- 19 vaccine (i.e., those ages 12 years and older) be fully vaccinated or meet one of the above exemptions and provide proof of a recent negative COVID -19 test result. See id. at 5-6. VI. Procedural history Against this factual backdrop, Plaintiffs filed the instant purported \"class action\" on August 19, 2021. See Aplt. App. at 6-42. Plaintiff Talisha Valdez is a mother of two children who entered to show their animals at the New Mexico State Fair. See Aplt. App. at 40- 41. Plaintiff Jennifer Blackford is a registered nurse employed at Presbyterian Hospital in Albuquerque. Id. at 38- 39. Neither Plaintiffs nor their children were vaccinated against COVID-19 at the time of filing. Id. at 38 - 41. Plaintiffs did not claim to qualify for a medical, disability, or religious exception but remain opposed to receiving a COVID-19 vaccine . See i d. at 38- 41, 51, 54- 55. Plaintiffs generally allege that the PHOs' vaccine requirements violate : (1) the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA), (2) the Equal Protection clause , (3) substantive due process, (4) procedural due process, (5) the contracts clause of Appellate Case: 21-2105 I, \u00a7 10 of the U.S. Constitution ,31 and (6) various rights under the New Mexico constitution. See Aplt. App. at 14-19 . Plaintiffs request ed a declaratory judgment that the PHOs' vaccine requirements were unconstitutional and further request ed a temporary restraining order and a preliminary and permanent injunction prohibiting Defendants from enforcing the vaccine requirements . Id. at 19-20. The district c ourt denied Plaintiffs' requested TRO and ordered expedited briefing regarding Plaintiffs' request for a preliminary injunction. Id. at 44- 47, 56 -61. Defendants filed a response in opposition supported by the declaration of the State Epidemiol ogist, Dr. Christine Ross. Id. at 62- 116. The court issued a memorandum opinion and order on September 13, 2021. Id. at 199 -228. The court concluded Plaintiffs were unlikely to succeed on the merits of any of their claims. Specifically, the Court held : (1) Plaintiffs' FDCA claim was likely to fail because the Pfizer vaccine received full FDA approval with regard to those ages 16 and older, and none of the statutory provisions cited by Plaintiffs applied to Defendants or otherwise prevented them from imposing the vaccine mandates ; Aplt. App. at 206 -08; (2) Plaintiffs' equal protection and substantive due process claims were likely to fail because the vaccine requirement did not discriminate against a suspect class or infringe on a fundamental right and was 31 Although Plaintiffs initially called the public health order a bill of attainder, they abandoned this argument and clarified they only challenged the order under the contracts clause. Compare Aplt. App. at 18 \u00b6 75, with id. at -rationally related to a compelling interest in stemming the spread of COVID- 19; id. at 208- 219; (3) Plaintiffs' procedural due process claim was likely to fail because the public health order was legislative in nature, which did not implicate procedural due process beyond general notice ; id. at 219 -20; (4) Plaintiffs' contracts clause claim was likely to fail because Plaintiffs failed to show that the vaccine requirement constituted a \"substantial impairment\" of their contracts and the requirement \"was drawn in an appropriate and reasonable way to advance a significant and legitimate public purpose\"; id. at 220- 23; and (5) Plaintiffs' state constitutional claims were likely to fail because New Mexico had not waived sovereign immunity to be sued in federal court. Id. at 223- 24. The district court further held that Plaintiffs failed to demonstrate any irrep arable harm because they did not demonstrate a likelihood of success on the merits for their constitutional claims and loss of employment or the opportunity to attend could be adequately compensated with monetary damages. Id. at 225- 36. The court also found that any harm befalling Plaintiff Blackford was the result of her employer's independent decision to require vaccines rather than the PHO. Id. Finally, the court held that the balance of the harms weighed in Defendants' favor given the strong public interest in protecting the public. Id. at 226- 27. Accordingly, the court denied Plaintiffs' requested preliminary injunction. Id. at 227. Plaintiffs filed a notice of interlocutory appeal and request for a stay and injunction pending Appellate Case: 21-2105 -appeal on September 13 and 14, respectively. Id. at 229, 276-82.32 This appeal followed. SUMMARY OF THE ARGUMENT As a preliminary matter, the Court must dismiss the appeal for lack of an active controversy vis-\u00e0- vis injunctive relief. But regardless of standing, the district court properly denied Plaintiffs' request for a preliminary injunction because they failed to satisfy any of the prerequisites for such extraordinary relief. Plaintiffs do not, as they cannot, demonstrate otherwise. ARGUMENT I. No plaintiff has standing to seek injunctive relief The Court should summarily dismiss this appeal for lack of jurisdiction. \"Article III of the Constitution limits the jurisdiction of federal courts to Cases and Controversies.\" San Juan Cty., Utah v. United States , 503 F.3d 1163, 1171 (10th Cir. 2007) (en banc). \"[A] suit does not present a Case or Controversy unless the plaintiff satisfies the requirements of Article III standing.\" Id. To establish such standing, a plaintiff must show three things: \"(1) an i njury in fact that is both concrete and particularized as well as actual or imminent; (2) a causal relationship between the injury and the challenged conduct; and (3) a likelihood that the injury would be redressed by a favorable decision. \" Protocols, LLC v. Leavitt , 549 F.3d 32 The district court de nied Plaintiffs' motion on October 7, 2021. Id. 1298 (10th Cir. 2008) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). A plaintiff must maintain standing for each form of relief sought at all times throughout the litigation for a court to retain jurisdiction. See Lippoldt v. C ole, 468 F.3d 1204, 1216 (10th Cir. 2006). Valdez admits that the state fair she originally sought to attend with her children is over, and therefore her claim for injunctive relief is now moot. See Opening Brief at 4. Nor does she claim any exception to the mootness doctrine applies. See generally id. Thus, the only plaintiff currently seeking injunctive relief is Blackford. See Aplt. App. at 6. Blackford seeks to bring claims on behalf of \"all others similarly situated that work in healthcare, congregate care or the Office of the Governor for the purpose of asserting the claims alleged in this complaint on a common basis.\" Id. at 11 \u00b6 26. However, as the district court found, Blackford's employer is separately requiring all its employees (not just those covered by the PHO) to be vaccinated. See Aplt. App. at 221- 22. This development deprives Blackford of standing to challenge the PHO or represent any class of plaintiffs. See Bronson v. Swensen , 500 F.3d 1099, 1109 (10th Cir. 2007) (\"The principle of causation for constitutional standing requires a plaintiff's injury to be fairly traceable to the challenged action of the defendant, and not the result of the independent action of some third party not before the court.\" (int ernal quotation marks and citations omitted)); Wooden v. Bd. of Regents of Univ. Sys. (\"[T]here cannot be adequate typicality between a class and a named representative unless the named representative has indivi dual standing to raise the legal claims of the class.\"). Blackford's assertion that her employer required vaccinations due to the PHO is unsubstantiated. She offered no evidence to support this argument to the district court, nor can she on appeal. See Aplt. App. at 221. Instead the statements of Presbyterian's CEO relied upon by the district court and the recent reports from Presbyterian's chief medical officer demonstrate Presbyterian instituted its own vaccine requirements because vaccines are the best way to combat the pandemic. Id. at 221 -22; Wyland, supra note 28. Therefore, the Court should dismiss the instant appeal, which only seeks interlocutory review of an order denying injunctive relief . II. The district court did not abuse its discretion in denying the requested preliminary injunction Assuming, arguendo , the Court concludes Blackford has standing to seek injunctive relief, the district court properly denied her request for a preliminary injunction because she failed to satisfy any of the prerequisites for such relief. \"It is well settled that a preliminary injunction is an extraordinary remedy, and that it should not be issued unless the movant's right to relief is clear and unequivocal.\" Heideman v. S. Salt Lake City , 348 F.3d 1182, 1188 (10th Cir. 2003) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). T o obtain a preliminary injunction, the moving party must demonstrate: \"(1) a likelihood of success on the merits; that the movant will suffer irreparable harm in the absence of preliminary relief; (3) that the balance of equities tips in the movant's favor; and (4) that the injunction is in the public interest.\" AG of Okla. v. Tyson Foods, Inc. , 565 F.3d 769, 776 (10th Cir. 2009) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). \"The third and fourth factors 'merge' when, like here, the gove rnment is the opposing party.\" Aposhian v. Barr , 958 F.3d 969, 978 (10th Cir. 2020). The movant must satisfy his or her burden for each one of these prerequisites. Din\u00e9 Citizens Against Ruining Our Env't , 839 F.3d 1276, 1281 -82 (10th Cir. 2016). This Cour t reviews a district court's decision to deny a preliminary injunction for an abuse of discretion. See Heideman, 348 F.3d at 1188. \"An abuse of discretion occurs where a decision is premised on an erroneous conclusion of law or where there is no rational basis in the evidence for the ruling.\" Fish v. Kobach, 840 F.3d 710, 723 (10th Cir. 2016) (internal quotation marks omitted). When determining whether the district court abused its discretion, the Court \"review[s] the district court's factual findings for clear error and its conclusions of law de novo.\" Id. A. Blackford fails to demonstrate any likelihood of success on merits 1. The FDCA does not apply to Defendants and any claim is now moot insofar as injunctive relief is requested Blackford first claim s Defendants are violating the 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 360bbb -3 of the FDCA because they did not \"advise Plaintiffs of the known and potential benefits and risks of such emergency use of the product, and of the extent to which such Appellate Case: 21-2105 risks are unknown\" or \"inform Plaintiffs of their right to refuse administration of [an] experimental vaccine.\" Aplt. App. at 15 \u00b6 55, 23. The FDCA authorizes the FDA to issue an \"emergency use authorization\" for a medical product, such as a vaccine, to be introduced into interstate commerce and administered to individuals in an emergency situation when the product has not yet undergone the standard review and approval process. \u00a7 360bbb- 3(a)(1), (2). Here, the FDA has granted emergency use authorizations for three COVID- 19 vaccines, with each vaccine manufact urer meeting more stringent standards compared to emergency use authorization vaccines in the past. See Background Section II, supra; Klaassen v. Trs. of Ind. Ind. July 18, 2021) . Blackford 's claims based on the emergency use authorization section of the FDCA fail as the FDCA does not prevent a public or private entity from requiring vaccines. The plain language of \u00a7 360bbb -3(e) demonstrates that the section only applies to healthc are providers administering COVID- 19 vaccines and to the potential vaccine recipients. The FDCA states for the emergency use of an unapproved product the Secretary of the HHS shall \" for person who carries out any activity for which the authorization is iss ued, establish such conditions on an authorization under this section as the Secretary finds necessary or appropriate to Appellate Case: 21-2105 (emphasis added). Specifically, the FDCA requires the Secretary issue: (i) Appropria te conditions designed to ensure that health care professionals administering the product are informed \u2014 (I) that the Secretary has authorized the emergency use of the product; (II) of the significant known and potential benefits and risks of the emergency use of the product, and of the extent to which such benefits and risks are unknown; and (III) of the alternatives to the product that are available, and of their benefits and risks. (ii) Appropriate conditions designed to ensure that individuals to whom the product is administered are informed \u2014 (I) that the Secretary has authorized the emergency use of the product; (II) of the significant known and potential benefits and risks of such use, and of the extent to which such benefits and risks are unknown; and (III) of the option to accept or refuse administration of the product, of the consequences, if any, of refusing administration of the product, and of the alternatives to the product that are available and of their benefits and risks. \u00a7 360bbb -3(e)(1)(a)(i), (ii) (emphases added). Several courts, as well as the U.S. Department of Justice, have analyzed this provision and concluded that it does not apply to those requiring vaccines but only to the individuals in the process of receiving a vaccine. 33 Thus, Blackford is unlikely to succeed on this claim. 33 See id. ; Bridges v. Hous. Methodist Hosp. , No. H \u00a7 360bbb -3] neither expands nor restricts the responsibilities of private employers; in fact, it does not apply at all to private employers [requiring employees be vaccinated].\"); Klaassen, if the FDCA did apply to Defendants, Plaintiffs' injunctive claims are now moot. The FDA granted the Pfizer vaccine full approval for individuals 16 years of age and older. See U.S. Food & Drug Admin., supra note 16. Given that Blackford is over the age of 16, her claim for injunctive relief based on the FDCA is moot. See Already, LLC v. Nike, Inc. , 568 U.S. 85, 91 (2013) ( \"A case becomes moot . . . when the issues presented are no longer live or the parties lack a legally cognizable interest in the outcome.\" (internal quotation and citation omitted)). 2. The vaccine mandate does not violate equal protection or substantive due process Blackford next claim s the vaccine mandate violates both equal protection and substantive due process. See Aplt. App. at 15-17 . Although the Equal Protection and Due Process clauses protect distinctly different interests, \"their substantive analyses converge.\" Powers v. Harris, 379 F.3d 1208, 1215 (10th Cir. 2004). For substantive due process claims challenging legislative -type actions, such as the vaccine mandate , the Court typically applies a two -part test in which it first asks whether the action LEXIS 133300, *64 - 65 (interpreting \u00a7 360bbb -3(e)(1 )(A)(ii) as establishing conditions to facilitate informed consent for medical providers and the persons receiving vaccines); Dep't of Justice, Whether Section 564 of the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act Prohibits Entities from Requiring the Use of a Vaccine Subject to an Emergency Use Authorization at 2 (July 6, 2021), https://www.justice.gov/olc/file/1415446/download (\"This language in section 564 specifies only that certain information be provided to potential vaccine recipients and does not prohibit entities from imposing vaccination requirements.\"). Appellate a fundamental right. See Dias v. City & Cty. of Denver, 567 F.3d 1169, 1182 (10th Cir. 2009). If so, the Court applies strict scrutiny; if not, the Court applies rational basis review. Id. Similarly, in considering equal protection claims, the Court will apply rational basis review unless the classification at issue discriminates against a suspect class. See Curley v. Perry , 246 F.3d 1278, 1285 (10th Cir. 2001). i. The vaccine mandate is subject to rational basis review a. Equal Protection Blackford does not allege (as she cannot) that she is a member of a suspect class which would give rise to any sort of heightened scrutiny. See Save Palisade FruitLands v. Todd , 279 F.3d 1204, 1210 (10th Cir. 2002) (stating governmenta l classifications are only subject to strict scrutiny if they target a suspect class such as race or national origin and intermediate scrutiny is applied to quasi- suspect classes like gender). Thus, the Court must use rational basis review when reviewing Blackford's equal protection claims. b. Substantive Due Process Blackford 's substantive due process claim is similarly subject to rational basis review. There are two types of substantive due process claims: (1) claims that the government has infringed a fundamental right and (2) claims that government action deprived a person of life, liberty, or property in a manner so arbitrary it shocks the judicial conscience. Doe v. Woodard , 912 F.3d apply the fundamental-rig hts approach when the plaintiff challenges legislative action, and the shocks- the-conscience approach when the plaintiff seeks relief for tortious executive action.\" Id. (alterations, internal quotation marks, and citation omitted). The fundamental -rights approach is applicable in this case, as the PHO is a quasi -legislative action generally applicable to thousands of New Mexicans, and it is the Department of Health's attempt to \"through policy, to achieve a stated n.1 (10th Cir. 2019). Legislative action is tested under a two -part substantive due process framework in which the Court asks first asks whether a fundamental right is implicated. Dias v. City & Cty. of Denver, 567 F.3d 1169, 1182 (10th Cir. 2009). 34 Even if the \"shocks conscience\" standard applied in this case, Blackford's claim would still fail. \"Conduct that shocks the judicial conscience is deliberate government action that is arbitrary and unrestrained by the established principles of private right and distributive justice.\" Woodard , 912 F.3d at 1300 (internal quotation marks omitted). Issuing public health orders requiring certain people working with highly vulnerable populations or attending a state fair to be vaccinated or meet an exception can hardly be considered conscious-shocking. See World Gym, Inc. v. Baker , Civil Action No. 20 -cv-11162 -DJC, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 131236, at *12 (D. Mass.

The state has a strong interest in stopping the spread of COVID- 19, and accordingly, it cannot be said that the Governor's conduct amounts conscience - shocking action.\"); Herrin v. Reeves , No. 3:20cv263 -MPM- RP, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 176604, at *23 (N.D. Miss. Sep. 25, 2020) (\"[T]he notion that restrictions designed to save human lives are 'conscious shocking' [is] absurd and not worthy plaintiff bears the burden of providing a \"careful description of the asserted fundamental liberty interest\" and demonstrating how such a right is \"objectively deeply rooted in [the] Nation's history and tradition\" and \"implicit in the concept of ordered liberty, such that neither liberty nor justice would exist if they were sacrificed.\" Washington v. Glucksberg , 521 U.S. 702, 720- 21 (1997) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). Vague, conclusory, or generalized assertion s will not suffice. See Chavez v. Martinez, 538 U.S. 760, 775 (2003) (noting plaintiff must put forth \"a 'careful description' of the asserted fundamental liberty interest for the purposes of substantive due process analysis; vague generalities . . . will not suffice \"). Blackford 's general allegations to a fundamental right \"to live without arbitrary governmental interference,\" \"to bodily integrity,\" and to \"engage in [her] chose profession\" can hardly be considered to satisfy Glucksberg's requirements. Aplt App. at 16. Blackford focused her arguments in the district court on her purposedly fundamental right to work. See id. at 24 -27, 121 -23. Yet she fails to explain how her right to work in a hospital unvaccinated during a pandemic is \"deeply rooted in [the n]ation's history and tradition.\" Glucksberg , 521 U.S. at 720- 21. Nor could she, as it is well established that \"[t]he right to 'make a living' is not a 'fundamental right,' for either equal protection or substantive due process purposes.\" Medeiros v. Vincent , 431 F.3d 25, 32 (10th Cir. 2012) (holding that a right to practice in one's chosen profession is not fundamental). Blackford switches gears on appeal to focus on the general right to bodily integrity but fails to explain how she has a fundamental right to refuse a vaccine during a pandemic. True, the Supreme Court has \"assumed\" and strongly suggested that individuals have some right to refuse unwanted medical treatment. See, e.g., Cruzan v. Director, Missouri Dept. of Health, 497 U.S. 261, 279 (1990); Glucksberg , 521 U.S. 210, 221- 22 (1990); Riggins v. Nevada , 504 U.S. 127, 138 (1992). \"But in these [cases]. . . this liberty interest has remained confined either by duly enacted and constitutional state laws or the state's legitimate interests that it had rationally pursued in regulation.\" Klaassen, 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 133300, at *60. Moreover, recognized (or assumed) in these cases weren't 'simply deduced from abstract concepts of personal autonomy[,]' . . . [t]hey were rooted in longstanding common law rules or legal traditions consistent with this Nation's history.\" Id. at *61 (quoting Glucksberg , 521 U.S. at 725 ). In contrast, there is no longstanding history of allowing individuals to refuse vaccination against communicable diseases. See id. at *62 (collecting cases applying rational basis review to assess mandatory vaccination measures and concluding that Indiana University's COVID -19 requirement was subject to rational basis \"[g]iven over a century's worth of rulings saying there is no greater right to Appellate Case: 21-2105 -refuse a vaccination than what the Constitution recognizes as a significant liberty\") ; see generally Jacobson, 197 U.S. 11. And this makes sense, as the refusal to receive a safe and effective vaccine affects more than just the individual but jeopardizes the health of others. See Klaassen, 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 133300, at *61 (\"Vaccines address a collective enemy, not just an individual one.\"). Accordingly, rational basis review is appropriate. ii. The vaccine mandate is rationally related to a compelling government interest in stemming the spread of COVID -19 To survive r ational basis review, \"the [law] need only be rationally related to a legitimate government purpose.\" See Save Palisade FruitLands, 279 F.3d at 1210. In challenging a governmental action for want of a rational basis, \"the burden is upon the challenging party to negative any reasonably conceivable state of facts that could provide a rational basis for the [law].\" Bd. of Trs. v. Garrett , 531 U.S. 356, 367 (2001) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). \"Th[e] standard is objective \u2014if there is a reasonable justification for the challenged action, [the court] do[es] not inquire into the government actor's actual motivations.\" Kan. Penn Gaming, LLC v. Collins, 656 F.3d 1210, 1216 (10th Cir. 2011). \"[R]ational -basis review does not give courts the option to speculate as to whether some other scheme could have better regulated the evils in question.\" Powers , 379 F.3d at 1217. Courts \"will not strike down a law as irrational simply because it may not succeed in Appellate Case: 21-2105 -bringing about the result it seeks to accomplish or because the statute's classifications lack razor -sharp precision. Id. (citations omitted). \"Nor can [a court] overturn a statute on the basis that no empirical evidence supports the assumptions underlying the legislative choice.\" Id. Indeed, rational basis scrutiny is so deferential that courts \"must independently consider whether there is any conceivable rational basis for the c lassification, regardless of whether the reason ultimately relied on is provided by the parties.\" Teigen v. Renfrow , 511 F.3d 1072, 1084 (10th Cir. 2007) (alterations, internal quotation marks, and citation omitted). It cannot be disputed that Defendants have a legitimate, indeed compelling , interest in stemming the spread of COVID- 19 and preventing more hospitalizations and deaths. See Roman Catholic Diocese v. Cuomo , 141 S. Ct. 63, 67 (2020) (\"Stemming the spread of COVID -19 is unquestionably a compellin g interest[.]\"). The question is whether requiring individuals working at hospitals and certain congregate care facilities to be vaccinated or meet an exception is rationally related to the State's interest? Unquestionably, it is. Over one hundred years ag o, the Supreme Court rejected a challenge to a universal smallpox vaccine mandate. In Jacobson , the state passed a law permitting a city to enforce vaccination of its citizens or face a $5.00 criminal penalty (about $140.00 today). 197 U.S. at 12; Cuomo , 141 S. Ct. at 70 (Gorsuch, J., concurring). After refusing a smallpox vaccine, as required by the city of Cambridge, Jacobson Appellate Case: 21-2105 -was sentenced to jail until he paid the fine. Jacobson, 197 U.S. at 11. Jacobson sued, claiming the mandate violated his right to \" bodily integrity.\" Id. at 13 -14. The Supreme Court rejected Jacobson's challenge, recognizing that a state's police power \"must be held to embrace, at least, such reasonable regulations established directly by legislative enactment as will protect the publ ic health and the public safety.\" Id. at 25. Thus, according to the Supreme Court, \"if a statute purporting to have been enacted to protect the public health, the public morals, or the public safety, has no real or substantial relation to those objects, or is beyond all question, a plain, palpable invasion of rights secured by the fundamental law.\" Id. at 31. Cambridge's vaccine mandate withstood this test. The mandate had a real and substantial relation to stemming the spread of smallpox\u2014 despite a minority view that the vaccines were ineffective. See id. at 31- 39. In so holding, the Court quoted the New York Court of Appeals, which stated, It must be conceded that some laymen, both learned and unlearned, and some physicians of great skill and repute, do not believe that vaccination is a preventive of smallpox. The common belief, however, is that it has a decided tendency to prevent the spread of this fearful disease and to render it less dangerous to those who contract it. . . . The fact that the belief is not universal is not controlling, for there is scarcely any belief that is accepted by everyone. The possibility that the belief may be wrong, and that science may yet show it to be wrong, is not conclusive; for the legislature has the right to pass laws wh ich, according to the common belief of the people, are adapted to prevent the spread of contagious diseases. In a free country, where the government is by the people, through their chosen representatives, practical legislation admits of no other standard of action[.] Appellate Viemeister v. White , 179 N.Y. 235, 239- 41, 72 N.E. 97 (1904). The Court also rejected Jacobson's offer of proof that the vaccine \"quite often caused serious and permanent injury,\" stating that to allow him to avoid vaccination on this general concern \"would practically strip the legislative department of its function to care for the public health and the public safety when endangered by epidemics of disease.\" Id. at 37. Jacobson has been upheld and relied on th roughout the years by courts across the country \u2014including in challenges to COVID-19 vaccine mandates. See, e.g. , Zucht v. King, 260 U.S. 174, 176 (1922) (relying on Jacobson to uphold a city ordinance excluding from its public school children not having a certificate of vaccination); cf. Roman Catholic , 141 S. Ct. at 71 (Gorsuch, J. concurring) (\"In Jacobson, individuals could accept the vaccine, pay the fine, or identify a basis for exemption. The imposition on Mr. Jacobson's claimed right to bodily integrity, thus, was avoidable and relatively modest. It easily survived rational basis review, and might even have survived strict scrutiny, given the opt-outs available to certain objectors.\"); America's Frontline (C.D. Cal. July 30, 2021) (citing Jacobson and concluding that the plaintiffs were unlikely to succeed in their due process claim against the University of California's COVID- 19 vaccination -Recently, a U. S. district court relied on Jacobson to reject a group of students' request for a preliminary injunction against the Indiana University's requirement that all students be vaccinated against COVID -19 or meet various religious or medical exemptions. See Klaa ssen, 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 133300, at **15-17, 42- 104. After carefully reviewing the current state of scientific consensus regarding the safety and effectiveness of the COVID- 19 vaccines, the court noted that \"the students' arguments amount to disputes ov er the most reliable science. But when reasonable minds can differ as to the best course of action . . . the court doesn't intervene so long as the university's process is rational in trying to achieve public health.\" Id. at *103. Ultimately, the court concluded that that Indiana University \"has a rational basis to conclude that the COVID- 19 vaccine is safe and efficacious for its students.\" Id. at *99. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit denied the students' motion for an injunction pending appeal, noting that \" Jacobson , which sustained a criminal conviction for refusing to be vaccinated, shows that plaintiffs lack [a fundamental right to attend school without being vaccinated].\" Klaassen v. Trs. of Ind. Univ. , No. 21-2326, 2021 U.S. App. LEXIS 22785, at *2 (7th Cir. Aug. 2, 2021). The Court further observed that the case was \"easier\" than Jacobson because the university had exceptions for persons \"who declare vaccination incompatible with their religious beliefs and persons for whom vaccination is medically contraindicated,\" and Indiana Appellate -was not requiring every member of the public be vaccinated but instead to simply condition attendance on vaccination. Klaassen , 2021 U.S. App. LEXIS 22785, at **3-4. Notably, Amy Coney Barrett denied the students' application for injunctive relief following the Seventh Circuit's decision, signaling the Supreme Court did not find the students' case meritorious.35 The instant case is identical to Klaasen and doomed to the same fate. Like Indiana University, Defendants side with the vast majority of the scientific community \u2014including the CDC and the State's public health experts\u2014 in concluding that the COVID -19 vaccines are a safe and effective way to prote ct individuals from becoming infected or at least becoming seriously ill. See generally Aplt. App. at 98 -109. Relying on this general consensus, Defendants instituted a targeted vaccine mandate aimed at individuals working with the State's most vulnerable populations in hospitals and certain congregate care facilities, as well as individuals attending one of the largest events in the state. See N.M. Dep't of Health, supra note 30. Moreover, Defendants (like Indiana University) tailored the mandate to provide exemptions for individuals who have a qualifying medical condition which immunization would endanger their health or a disability or sincerely held 35 See Docket Search , U.S. Supreme Court, https://www.supremecourt.gov/docket/docket.aspx (search \"No. 21A15\"; select \"Docket requiring accommodation. Compare N.M. Dep't of Health, supra note 30, with Klaassen, 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 133300, at **15 -17. Blackford's disagreement with the scientific community or speculation about theoretical long- term side effects of the vaccines does not negate Defendants' rational basis for their actions. See Jacobson , 197 U.S. at 34- 37; Klaassen, 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 133300, at ** 103. Nor do the PHO's vaccine requirements need to \"take into account for or recognize the health implications associated to [sic] individuals that have natural immunity[,]\" which Blackford allege s is \"equal to or better\" than the immunity provided from vaccines. Aplt. App. at 9 \u00b6\u00b6 13 -14. As explained above, there is ample evidence that the immunity provided by vaccines is more robust and durable than natural immunity. See generally Background Secti on II, supra ; see also America's Frontline Doctors, 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 144477, at *17 (\"The Court finds that there is clearly a rational basis for Defendants to institute the Policy requiring vaccination, including for individuals who previously had COV ID-19.\" (emphasis added)). And even if Blackford's allegations happened to be true, the PHO's vaccine requirements need not be narrowly tailored to exclude individuals who have been previously infected. See Powers , 379 F.3d at 1217 (\"[W]e will not strike down a law as irrational simply because it may not succeed in bringing about the result it seeks to accomplish, or because the statute's classifications lack razor -sharp precision.\"). Left only with speculative arguments previously the Supreme Court, the Court must conclude Blackford cannot succeed on her equal protection and substantive due process claims. 3. The vaccine mandate does not implicate procedural due process because it is quasi legislative Blackford next claim Defendants violated he r right to procedural due process under the Fourteenth Amendment. See Aplt. App. at 12. However , a procedural due process violation will not lie when the underlying governmental action affects a general class of persons. See Okla. Educ. Ass'n v. Alcoholic Beverage Laws Enf't Comm'n, 889 F.2d 929, 936 (10th Cir. 1989) (\"When the legislature passes a law which affects a general class of persons, those persons have all received procedural due process\u2014 the legislative process.\"). Although this exceptio n typically applies to laws passed by Congress or state legislatures, courts have recognized this exception so long as the challenged action appl ies generally to a larger segment of the population rather than a limited number of individuals. See, e.g., Curlott v. Campbell, 598 F.2d 1175, 1181 (9th Cir. 1979) (\"At the outset we doubt very much that procedural due process prior to reduction of benefits is required when an agency makes a broadly applicable, legislative- type decision.\" (citing Bi -Metallic Inves tment Co. v. State Board of Equalization , 239 U.S. 441 (1915)). This is because \"[w]here a rule of conduct applies to more than a few people[,] it is impracticable that every one should have a direct voice in its adoption.\" Bi -Metallic , 239 No r would there be any \"risk of an erroneous deprivation\" of a right or property interest. Mathews v. Eldridge , 424 U.S. 319, 335 (1976). Following this principle, courts across the country have held that executive orders issued in response to the current pa ndemic were legislative in nature, and therefore, did not implicate procedural due process. See, e.g. , Frantz v. Beshear, No. 21-5163, 2021 U.S. *7 (6th Cir. Oct. 18, 2021); ETP Rio Rancho Park, v. Grisham -WRP, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 116860, at *29 (D. Haw. July 2, 2020). Respectfully, this Court should likewise hold that Blackford is not en titled to any more procedural due process regarding the issuance of the PHO other than the general notice she indisputably had. 4. The vaccine mandate does not violate the contracts clause because it does not substantially impair Plaintiffs' contracts , and it is drawn in a reasonable way to advance a significant public purpose Blackford is also unlikely to succeed on her contracts clause claim. \"[T]he Contract Clause limits the power of the States to modify their own contracts as well as to regulate those between private parties.\" U.S. Tr. Co. of N.Y. v. New Jersey , 431 U.S. 1, 17 (1977). However, the Contracts Clause \"is not an absolute one and is not to be read with literal exactness like a mathematical formula.\" Home Bldg. & Loan Asso. v. Blaisdell , 290 U.S. 398, 428 (1934). Nor the the police power of the States.\" Allied Structural Steel Co. v. Spannaus , 438 U.S. 234, 241 (1978). Courts apply a two -step test to determine whether a state law violates the Contracts Clause. \"The threshold issue is whether the state law has 'operated as a substantial impairment of a contractual relationship.'\" Sveen v. Melin , 138 S. Ct. 1815, 1821-22, (2018) (quoting Allied, 438 U.S. at 244). \"In answering that question, the Court has considered the extent to which the law undermines the contractual bargain, inter feres with a party's reasonable expectations, and prevents the party from safeguarding or reinstating his rights.\" Id. at 1822. When a law substantially impairs or destroys36 a contract, \"the State, in justification, must have a significant and legitimate public purpose behind the [law], such as the remedying of a broad and general social or economic problem.\" Stillman v. Teachers Ins. & Annuity Ass'n College Ret. Equities Fund , 343 F.3d 1311, 1321 (10th Cir. 2003) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). Specifically, the court will ask \"whether the state law is drawn in an appropriate and reasonable way to advance a 36 Blackford cites U.S. Trust Co of N.Y. for the proposition that the Contracts Clause prevents the State from using its police power to destroy an individual contract. See Opening Brief at 18. However, the quotation relied upon by Blackford is not the Court's holding, but rather a restatement of the district court's conclusion rejected by the Court . See U.S. Trust Co. , 431 U.S. at 26 (\"The trial court's 'total destruction' test is based on what we think is a misreading of W.B. Worthen Co. v. Kavanaugh , 295 U.S. 56 (1935).\"); id. at 22 (\"States must possess broad power to adopt general regulatory measures without being concerned that private contracts will be impaired, or even destroyed, as a result. Otherwise, one would be able to obtain immunity from state regulation by making private contractual arrangements.\"). Appellate , 138 S. Ct. at 1822 (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). Blackford's claim fails for three reasons. First, Blackford failed to demonstrate that the vaccine requirement substantially interferes with her employment contract because she did not provide the district court with any copies of the contract. See Aplt. App. at 221. Second, the PHO does not substantially impair her contract because her employer is independently requiring COVID- 19 vaccinations for its entire workforce. See id. Lastly, the vaccine requirement is an appropriate and reasonable means of advancing the State's significant and legitimate purpose. It is undeniable that Defendants have not only a legitimate but a compelling interest in preventing the spread of COVID -19, see Roman Catholic Diocese , 141 S. Ct. at 67, especially now when its hospitals are being overwhelmed by a highly contagious variant. See Lee, supra note 25; Deliso, supra note 27 ; Wyland, supra note 28. There is also substantial evidence that vaccines are the best way to prevent the strain on New Mexico's healthcare system and protect th e State's population. See generally Aplt. App. at 98- 109. Requiring the workers who interact with ill patients or serve persons living in close proximity is a reasonable measure to protect not only the populations within hospitals and congregate care facilities but also all employees from the risk of severe illness or death. See id. Therefore, Blackford is unlikely to succeed on her contracts clause claims. Appellate Case: 21-2105 Blackford 's state constitutional claims are barred by sovereign immunity Finally, Blackford brings a claim under the newly enacted New Mexico Civil Rights Act, NMSA 1978, \u00a7\u00a7 41 -4A-1 to - 13 (2021), asserting that the PHOs violate various provisions of the New Mexico constitution. See Aplt. App. at 18- 19. However, sovereign immunity prohibits Blackford from maintaining such claims in federal court. See Johns v. Stewart , 57 F.3d 1544, 1553 (10th Cir. 1995) (\"[T]he Eleventh Amendment bars suits brought in federal court seeking to enjoin a state official from violating state law.\"). Though the State waived sovereign immunity in passing the New Mexico Civil Rights Act, see \u00a7 41-4A-9, it did so only for suits brought in New Mexico state courts. See \u00a7 41- 4A-3(B) (providing that a individuals \"may maintain an action to establish liability and recover actual damages and equitable or injunctive relief in any New Mexico district court\" (emphasis added)) ; Sossamon v. Texas , 563 U.S. 277, 285 (2011) (\"[A] waiver of sovereign immunity will be strictly construed, in terms of its scope, in favor of the sovereign. So, for example, a State's consent to suit in its own courts is not a waiver of its immunity from suit in federal court.\" (internal quotation marks and citations omitted)). Accordingly, the Court cannot consider these state law claims in determining Blackford's likelihood of success on the merits. 37 37 Leaving sovereign immunity aside, the Court should not consider Blackford's state law claims in determining the likelihood of success on the merits in light of her Appellate Case: 21-2105 fails to demonstrate any irreparable harm Plaintiffs' failure to demonstrate a likelihood of success on the merits of their claims is determinative to their requested preliminary injunctive relief. See Amoco Oil Co. v. Rainbow Snow , Inc., 809 F.2d 656, 664 (10th Cir. 1987) (\"As a prerequisite to the granting of a preliminary injunction, the moving party must show, in addition to the likelihood of success on the merits, that it will suffer irreparable injury unless the injunction issues.\" (emphasis added)). Equally fatal to Plaintiffs' request is their inability to demonstrate any form of irreparable harm required for their requested injunctive relief. See Schrier v. Univ. of Colo. , 427 F.3d 1253, 1267 (10th Cir. 2005). \"To constitute irreparable harm, an injury must be certain, great, actual and not theoretical.\" Id. (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). \"Irreparable harm is not harm that is merely serious or substantial.\" Heideman v. S. failure to bring any viable federal claims. See Merrifield v. Bd. of Cty . Comm'rs , 654 F.3d 1073, 1085 (10th Cir. 2011) (stating that a district court may decline supplemental jurisdiction when it has \"dismissed all claims over which it has original jurisdiction\" (quoting 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1367(c)(3)); cf. Bray v. City of N.Y., 356 F. Supp. 2d 277, 282 (S.D.N.Y. 2004) (\"This Court may not entertain the City's motion for a preliminary injunction if supplemental jurisdiction is lacking or imprudent.\"). Additionally, the Court should decline supplemental jurisdiction because Plaintiffs' claims raise novel and complex issues of state constitutional law that should be addressed by New Mexico courts. See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1367(c)(1); see generally Linda M. Vanzi, et al., State Constitutional Litigation in New Mexico: All Shield and No Sword, 48 N .M. L. Rev. 302, 305 (2018) (stating that the New Mexico supreme court has considered only three civil cases involving a claim under the state constitution in the past twenty years). Appellate Case: 21-2105 F.3d 1182, 1189 (10th Cir. 2003) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Blackford has not established a likelihood of success on the merits of any of her claims, and therefore cannot use a purported constitutional violation as the basis for any irreparable har m. See Schrier, 427 F.3d at 1266 (\"Dr. Schrier has failed to demonstrate the requisite likelihood of success on his free speech and academic freedom claims. As a result, he is not entitled to a presumption of irreparable injury.\"). Further , as the district c ourt found , Blackford cannot demonstrate any harm vis -\u00e0-vis the PHO because her employer has independently announced it will be requiring its entire workforce to be vaccinated. See Aplt. App. at 221 -22. Moreover, \"[a] permanent loss of employment, standing alone, does not equate to irreparable harm.\" E. St. Louis Laborers' Local 100 v. Bellon Wrecking & Salvage Co., 414 F.3d 700, 704 (7th Cir. 2005). Hence, Blackford's requested preliminary injunctive relief was also properly rejected for want of irreparable injury. C. Blackford fails to demonstrate that the balance of the equities weighs in her favor Even if Blackford could demonstrate a likelihood of success or an irreparable injury, she fails to clearly demonstrate that the threatened injury outweighs the harm that preliminary injunctive relief would cause the public. It cannot be gainsaid that the S tate (and the public) has a compelling interest in limiting the spread of a deadly, contagious virus. See Roman Catholic Diocese , 141 S. Ct. at 67. -may incur hardship in seeking alternative employment, granting her requested preliminary relief would undoubtedly lead to more New Mexicans falling ill and dying. See League of Indep. Fitness Facilities & Trainers, Inc. v. Whitmer, 814 Fed. Appx. 125, 129 (6th Cir. 2020) (\"Enjoining the actions of elected state officials, especially in a situation where an infectious disease can and has spread rapidly, causes irreparable harm.\"). New Mexico's hospitals are at or near capacity, and New Mexicans continue to succumb to the virus every day. See generally Aplt. App. at 98-109. Each newly announced death is not simply a statistic, but a mother, a son, a grandfather, a sister. Each one leaves a gaping hole in the lives of their loved ones, and each one deserves protection. These losses are truly irreparable, and the community's interest in preventing more is paramount. Cf. League of Indep. Fitness Facilities & Trainers, Inc. , 814 Fed. Appx. at 129 (concluding that \"the Governor's interest in combatting COVID -19 is at least equally significant\" to the plaintiffs ' \"real risk of losi ng their businesses\").

In an effort to stem the rapid resurgence of a highly cont agious and potentially more lethal variant of the virus that causes COVID -19, Defendants issued a public health order requiring individuals working with New Mexico's most vulnerable populations in hospitals and congregate care settings to receive a safe an d effective vaccine \u2014one of which is now fully approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration \u2014or meet a health, disability, or religious exemption.

Defendants also required all vaccine -eligible individuals to show proof of vaccination or entitlement to an exemption to attend the (now over) New Mexico State Fair. See id. Plaintiffs \u2014two individuals subject to the vaccine requirements and apparently not entitled to an exemption\u2014 seek to halt Defendants' carefully calculated life -saving measures based on their (faulty and speculative) belief that the vaccines are neither safe nor necessary. But such minority views are insufficient to defeat the wisdom of elected officials guided by the State and nation's preeminent public health experts. As the U.S. Supreme Court proclaimed over a century ago , We are not prepared to hold that a minority, res iding or remaining in any city or town where [a deadly, contagious virus] is prevalent, and enjoying the general protection afforded by an organized local government, may thus defy the will of its constituted authorities, acting Appellate Case: 21-2105 -in good faith for all, under the legislative sanction of the State. If such be the privilege of a minority then a like privilege would belong to each individual of the community, and the spectacle would be presented of the welfare and safety of an entire population being subordinated to the notions of a single individual who chooses to remain a part of that population. Jacobson v. Massachusetts, 197 U.S. 11, 37-38 (1905). Not only do Plaintiffs challenge the district court's denial of a preliminary injunction, they now ask this Court to grant them the same extraordinary relief that was denied by the district court and a stay of the underlying proceedings. \"Such a request demands a significantly higher justification than a request for a stay because, unlike a stay, an injunction does not simply suspend judicial alteration of the status quo but grants judicial intervention that has been withheld by lower courts.\" S. Bay United Pentecostal Church v. Newsom, 140 S. Ct. 1613, 1613 (2020) (Roberts, J., concurring) (quoting Respect Maine PAC v. McKee , 562 U.S. 996 (2010) . \"This power is used where the legal rights at issue are indisputably clear and, even then, sparingly and only in the most critical and exigent circumstances.\" Id. (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). In requesting injunction or stay pending appeal, the applicant must demonstrate: (1) \"the likelihood of success on appeal\" ; (2) \"the threat of irreparable harm if the stay or injunction is not granted \"; (3) \"the absence of harm to opposing parties if the stay or injunction is granted\"; and (4) \"any risk of harm to the public interest.\" 10th Cir. R. 8.1. \"In ruling on such a request, [the C]ourt makes -inquiry as it would when reviewing a district court 's grant or denial of a preliminary injunction. Thus, [the Court] must consider, based on a preliminary record, whether the district court abused its discretion and whether the movant has demonstrated a clear and unequivocal right to relief. \" Homans v. City of Albuquerque, 264 F.3d 1240, 1243 (10th Cir. 2001) (citation omitted) (emphasis added). Plaintiffs filed the instant motion for an injunction and stay pending appeal (the \"Motion \") along with their opening brief challenging the district court's denial of a preliminary injunction. See Motion at 2. Rather than separately explain why an injunction and stay pending appeal now necessary, the Motion simply incorporates by reference the arguments contained in Plaintiffs' opening brief. See id. at 3. Defendants understand such practice to generally be disfavored by this Court. Cf. Jones v. Price, 695 Fed. Appx. 374, 377 n.2 (10th Cir. 2017) (rejecting attempt to circumvent briefing requirements by incorporating by reference arguments made outside the brief). However, to the extent the Court entertains the Motion based on arguments made in Plaintiffs' opening brief, Defendants respectfully request the Court consider the same made in Defendants' answer brief. As explained fu lly in Defendants' brief (filed concurrently with this response), there is no longer any plaintiff with standing to seek injunctive relief, and regardless, Plaintiffs fail to demonstrate any of the prerequisites for a preliminary injunction, let alone an injunction pending appeal. See generally Defendants/Appellees Governor Secretary Scrase's Answer Brief . Nor do Plaintiffs explain anywhere how they would be irreparably harmed absent a stay of the litigation that they themselves initiated. See Renegotiation Board v. Bannercraft Clothing Co. , Inc., 415 U.S. 1, 24 (1974) (\"Mere litigation expense, even substantial and unrecoupable cost, does not constitute irreparable injury\"). CONCLUSION For the foregoing reasons, this Court should deny Plaintiffs' request for an injunction and stay pending appeal . Respectfully submitted, /s/ Holly Agajanian Holly Agajanian Maria S.

Ct. 2791, 120 L. ................................ ....1, Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham's hypocrisy regarding a fundamental right to choose medical procedures for one's own body cannot be overstated. Tellingly of this hypocrisy, earlier this year, before she began telling nurses like Appellant Blackfor d what medical procedures they must receive into their bodies in order to remain employed anywhere in the state of New Mexico in their chosen profession, Governor Lujan Grisham equivocally stated regarding the recently passed pro-choice abortion bill that she signed in to law that provides that an abortion may be performed up to the delivery of that child thereby ending a life stating \"[a]nyone who seeks to violate bodily integrity, or to criminalize womanhood, is in the business of dehumanization. New Mexi co is not in that business \u2014 not anymore . Our state statutes now reflect this inviolable recognition of humanity and dignity.\" And yet, despite a clear acknowledgment that the state's right t o protect life is abrogated by a woman's choice for her body in relation to pregnancy; the Appellees ' responses on appeal do not even mention the abrogation of Jacobson v. Massachusetts, 197 U.S. 11(1905), in Planned Parenthood of Se. Pennsylvania v. Casey , 505 U.S. 833 (1992). In fact, not only does the Governor's br ief not mention Casey , no explanation is offered to square that requiring a vaccine with know n risks for adverse reactions to the point of death is acceptable as a plenary override of individual liberty claims; but banning abortions Appellate 12/13/2021 Page: 4 -App. 171 -2 up to delivery are out of bounds for a state that wishes to protect the lives of the unborn when weighed against a woman's right to choose. And just as the Appellees do not address the limits on plenary power over mandatory medical procedures found in nu merous Supreme Court decision s since Jacobson ; likewise does the Response ignore and fails to mention, much less differentiate, the significant jurisprudence supporting the fundamental liberty interest of engaging in ones chosen profession. Tellingly , Barry v. Barchi, 443 U.S. 55 (1979), Barsky v. Board of Regents of University of State of New York, 347 U.S. 442 (1954) Truax v. Raich , 239 U.S. 33 (1915), Meyer v. Nebraska , 262 U.S. 390 (1923) are not discussed in the Appellees' Response s even though they wer e discussed before the District Court and in the Opening Brief. It is as though the Appellees , here, believe that they can ignore the Supreme Court's interpretations of the Constitution's protections of individual liberty claims; just as they ignore the Constitutional rights of New Mexico's citizens , in a campaign to seize ever more control over everyday life in the name of combatting a pandemic that is less deadly than the obesity driven heart disease pandemic the state faces. Certainly , that grab for plena ry governmental control to protect against a disease is less important than protecting the lives of unborn children where the risk of fatality from th at medical procedure is virtually 100%. Appellate -3 ARGUMENT I. THE APPELLEE'S ARGUMENT REGARDING STANDING IS NONSENSICAL. Here, Appellees' responses require this Court to suspend reality and common sense. Appellees ask this Court to ignore the reality that Appellant Blackford 's employer was not requiring vaccination until compelled to do so in order to remain compliant with the Appellees' mandatory regulation. But, perhaps more importantly, the Appellees arguments regarding standing fail to recognize that the Appellees' mandate covered the entire state making it unlawful for Appellant Blackford to work as a nurse (her chosen profession) anywhere in the state for any employer. The idea that Appellees' PHO was not a cause of Appellant Blackford's injury conveying standing requires this Court to ignore the Supreme Court's precedent regarding the state depriving someo ne of their ability to engage in their chosen profession and the fact that the PHO applied to all healthcare workers regardless of the decisions their employer might have made in the absence of the PHO vaccine mandate. II. Appellees Continue to Ignore, Just as the District Court Did, Clear Precedent Regarding the Fundamental Liberties Implicated by Their Actions Contrary to the Protections of the Fourteenth Amendment. Despite, clear inclusion in the briefing before the District Court and in the Opening Brief, Appel lees make no effort at addressing the clear and unrepudiated precedent from the Supreme Court over a century ago that \"[i]t requires no argument Appellate -4 to show that the right to work for a living in the common occupations of the community is of the very essenc e of the personal freedom and opportunity that it was the purpose of the [Fourteenth] Amendment to secure.\" Truax v. Raich , 239 U.S. 33, 41, 36 S.Ct. 7, 60 L.Ed. 131 (1915) (holding that a state anti -alien labor statute violated both equal protection and due process). Nor does the Appellees ' Answer brief address the Supreme Court 's observ ation that the Fourteenth Amendment guaranteed the right, inter alia , \"to engage in any of the common occupations of life ....\" Meyer v. Nebraska , 262 U.S. 390, 399, 43 S.Ct. 625, 67 L.Ed. 1042 (1923 ). But, of course they do not address those cases in their Answe r brief, because if they did, any argument that the District Court correctly applied rational basis review instead of strict scrutiny or at least intermediate scrutiny goes out the window. Likewise, the Appellees ignore the clear holding from Casey that the states plenary power to protect health and safety does not automatically override the fundamental liberty interest of bodily integrity that the Governor elsewhere holds so sacrosanct or at least so when it comes to a right to an abortion. In fact, the quo tation ignored and unaddressed by Appellees in the Answer Brief from the Opening Brief bears repeating here because of that omission: Roe, however, may be seen not only as an exemplar of Griswold liberty but as a rule (whether or not mistaken) of personal autonomy and bodily integrity, with doctrinal affinity to cases recognizing limits on governmental power to mandate medical treatment or to bar its rejection. Appellate Case: 21-2105 If so, our cases since Roe accord with Roe's view that a State's interest in the protection of life falls short of justifying any plenary override of individual liberty claims. Cruzan v. Director, Mo. Dept. of Health, 497 U.S. 261, 278, 110 S.Ct. 2841, 2851, 111 L.Ed.2d 224 (1990); cf., e.g., Rigg ins v. Nevada, 504 U.S. 127, 135, 112 S.Ct. 1810, 1815, 118 L.Ed.2d 479 (1992); Washington v. Harper, U.S. 210, 110 S.Ct. 1028, 108 L.Ed.2d 178 (1990); see also, e.g., Rochin v. California, 342 U.S. 165, 72 S.Ct. 205, 96 L.Ed. 183 (1952); Jacobson v. M assachusetts, 197 U.S. 11, 24 -30, 25 S.Ct. 358, 360 -363, 49 L.Ed. 643 (1905). Planned Parenthood of Se. Pennsylvania v. Casey , 505 U.S. 833, 857, 112 S. Ct. 2791, 2810, 120 L. Ed. 2d 674 (1992) . A fundamental right to bodily integrity protected by the Four teenth Amendment requiring the District Court to apply strict scrutiny really isn't a subject the Supreme Court has left unclear or open for debate despite the efforts of the District Court and the Appellees to avoid that precedent. III. Appellees' Argument Re garding the Violation of the Contract Clause Falls Flat When the Test is Correctly Applied Appellant supplied via Declaration to the District Court that because of the Public Health Order that she was prohibited by her employer (or by any employer for that matter) from continuing any employment contract as nurse in the state of New Mexico. Thus, because the Public Health Order made her continued employment unlawful, her employment contract was not just substantially interfered with, it was completely destroyed. The fact that, later after it was already unlawful to employ Appellant Blackford , her employer also made it a policy does not absolve the state of New Mexico for its actions to interfere with that contract. Nor is it a reasonable condition to require a person to inject a potentially dangerous substance Appellate Case: 21-2105 -6 that has not been thoroughly vetted and tested by normal medical standards int o their body in order to continue their employment. Not when testing, masking and social distancing were held to be otherwise sufficient prior to the PHO vaccine mandate and after it. CONCLUSION Death is an unfortunate reality of life. Appellees have no problem with the death of unborn children when it meets their standards for protecting a women's fundamental right to get an abortion, but when it comes to those same women working as nurses not wishing to inject their bodies with an experimental gene - altering \"vaccine\" that does not actually immunize them and puts them at serious risk for heart problems or other unproven , as of yet , serious side effects , that respect for a women's liberty to choose for her own body is rudely discarded in favor of the plenary power to protect the common good. This is definitionally the fascism that our Constitution was established to protect against. Appellees should not be allowed to trample liberty whenever it suits their whim, and this Court should correct the District Co urt's error in denying preliminary injunctive relief.

INTRODUCTION Father of the Bill of Rights and 4th U.S. President, James Madison, famously stated that \"crisis is the rallying cry of tyrants. \" Even today in modern day New Mexico, the last public health orders pronounced by the Governor through her Acting Secretary of Health prove that statement is as true today as it was for the revolutionary period of our Republic's history. Not since the Japa nese internment camps that so darkly cloud our modern history , set Case 1:21-cv-00783 Document 1 Filed 08/19/21 Page 1 of 26 -App. 183 - 2 out by President Franklin Roosevelt and upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court in Korematsu v. United States , 323 U.S. 214, 65 S. Ct. 193, 89 L. Ed. 194 (1944), does anything resembling the punit ive tyrannical efforts contained in the public health orders at issue in this case even remotely arrive on the horizon of our American Liberty. Yet here, a tyrannical governor is willing to punish children and destroy livelihoods to punish adults that wou ld dare to refuse her orders that advance her agenda of violating the right to bodily integrity. We stand at the precipice of losing the liberty that is foundational to our Country and these brave Plaintiffs in this complaint respectfully beg this Court t o stop that destruction of liberty. Thomas Paine in American Crisis stated that: \"tyranny, like hell, is not easily conquered, yet, we have this consolation with us, that the harder the conflict, the more glorious the triumph.\" PARTIES AND JURISDICTI ON 1. Plaintiff Talisha Valdez is a resident of Union County, New Mexico. She is the County Extension Agent and the mother of two daughters who entered to show their 4 -H animals at the New Mexico State Fair. 2. Plaintiff Jennifer Blackford is resident of Bernalil lo County, New Mexico. She is a registered nurse employed by Presbyterian Hospital in Albuquerque. 1. Defendant Michelle Lujan Grisham is the Governor of New Mexico, and she is sued in her individual and official capacities. 2. Defendant Dr. David Scrase , M.D. is the Human Services Secretary and is the acting New Mexico Department of Health Secretary. He is sued in h is individual and official capacities. 3. The Court has subject matter jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331 and 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 because, Plaint iffs allege a current and imminent continuing violation of their rights under Case 1:21-cv-00783 Document 1 Filed 08/19/21 Page 2 of 26 -App. 184 - 3 the laws and Constitution of the United States. 4. The Court may declare the legal rights and obligations of the parties in this action pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2201 because this act ion presents an actual controversy within the Court's jurisdiction. 5. Venue is proper in this judicial district under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1391(b). All Defendants are residents of and/or perform their official duties in this district. In addition, all of the events giving rise to the claims in this Complaint arose in this district. GENERAL ALLIGATIONS 8. On August 17, 2021 , Acting Cabinet Secretary David R. Scrase, M.D. issue d the Public Health Emergency Order Requiring All School Workers Comply with Certain Health Requirements and Requiring Congregate Care Facility Workers, Hospital Workers, and Employees of the Office of the Governor Be Fully Vaccinated. (Exhibit 1). 9. As a re sult of the above -mentioned Pub lic Health Order , Plaintiff Blackford and other Congregate Care Facility Workers, Hospital Workers, and Employees of the Office of the Governor similarly situated (likely numbering in the 1000) who are not currently vaccinate d must be received their first experimental EUA shot within ten days of the effective date or are required to be terminated from their employment in order for the employers to be lawfully compliant . 10. Plaintiff Blackford is currently working as registered nu rse for Presbyterian Hospitals, based upon her medical training as well as experience as a nurse for 10 years and her own independent research she is opposed to receiving the EUA covid vaccines . See Exhibit 2, Declaration of Jennifer Blackford. 11. The Publi c Health Order (\"PHO\") does not give an exemption for those in the affected professions to abstain from being vaccinated without falling under one of the prescribed Case 1:21-cv-00783 Document 1 Filed 08/19/21 Page 3 of 26 -App. 185 - 4 exemptions. 12. The statute granting the F ood and Drug Administration (FDA) the power to authorize a medical product for emergency use requires that the person being administered the unapproved product be advised of his and her right to refuse administration of the product. See 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 360bbb -3(e)(1)(A) (\"Section 360bbb -3\"). 13. Covid -recovered individuals have equal to or better immunity response than vaccinated individuals.1234 Moreover, covid -recovered individuals with natural immunity do not benefit from receiving the vaccines.5 14. The PHO does not account for or recognize t he health implications associated to individuals that have natural immunity. 15. All three of the currently available Covid vaccines for the United States are available under a n \"Emergency Use Authorization\" or \"EUA\" on an emergency declaration from the Secretary of Health under 21 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 360bbb -3. 16. Only the Pfizer Covid vaccine is currently authorized for children aged 12 to 18 years old.6 17. Under the PHO , individual s that qualify to receive the Covid vaccine must either be fully vaccinated or be exempt under one of the three exceptions and possess a covid negative test from within 48 hours to enter upon the grounds of the New Mexico State Fair Grounds. 18. In order to rec eive the second shot of the Pfizer vaccine 21 days must have passed from the date that the individual received the first shot of the 2 doses of the vaccine.7 In order to 1 https://www.cell.com/cell/pdf/S0092 Filed 08/19/21 Page 4 of 26 -App. 186 - 5 be considered fully vaccinated it must have been 2 weeks since your second Pfizer sh ot.8 Thus, if a child receives their first shot on August 18, 2021 (the day following issuance of the PHO) that child is not fully vaccinated and able to enter the New Mexico State Fair Grounds until September 22, 2021, which is 3 days after the New Mexi co State Fair ends. 19. The PHO is purely punitive towards parents and the children of parents that have previously exercised their fundamental liberty to raise their children in a manner the y chose that does not include injecting their child or children with an experimental EUA vaccine. 20. Plaintiff Valdez and her children have entered into a contract to exhibit their 4 -H animals at the New Mexico State Fair. See Exhibit 3, Declaration of Talisha Valdez. 21. Plaintiff Valdez has two daughters, Raley (age 11) and Ria ta (age 12), who have entered as exhibitors 4 pigs and 3 lambs to compete at the New Mexico State Fair. The daughters have expended approximately at least 150 hours per month on their animals and over $9000.00 to prepare their animals for the State Fair. 22. There is no way that Plaintiff Valdez, who is not vaccinated , or her 12-year-old daughter may enter the fairgrounds to exhibit the animals that they paid entry fees to enter. 23. Upon information and belief, there are numerous (more than 35 families) that are punished by the PHO in an identical fashion. 24. In addition, Plaintiff Valdez is prohibited from performing an integral part of her job responsibilities as a Union County Agricultural Extension Agent by her exclusion from the New Mexico State Fair Grounds. 8 https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019 -ncov/vaccines/second -shot.html Case 1:21-cv-00783 Document 1 Filed 08/19/21 Page 5 of 26 -App. 187 - 6 CLASS ACTION ALLEGATIONS A. GENERAL CLASS ACTION ALLEGATIONS 25. Plaintiff Talisha Valdez brings this action, on behalf of herself and all others similarly situated with children registered to exhibit animals at the 2021 New Mexico State Fair, for the purpose of asserting the claims alleged in this complaint on a common basis. 26. Plaintiff Jennifer Blackford brings this action, on behalf of herself and all others similarly situated that work in healthcare, congregate care or the Office of the Governor for the purpose of asserting the claims alleged in this complaint on a common basis. 27. A class action is a superior means, and the only practicable means, by which Plaintiffs and unknown class members can challenge the State of New Mexico's actions, acting through her Governor and the Governor's cabinet members, restricting the rights (constitutional and statutory) of Plaintiffs and similarly situated class members without providing them due process of law. 28. This action is brought and may properly be maintained as a class action pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(a), and 23(b)(2). 29. This action satisfies the numerosity, commonality, typicality, and adequacy requirements of Rule 23(a), as well as the predominance and superiority requirements of Rule 23(b)(2), where applicable. 30. Plaintiffs propose two (2) classes seeking declaratory and injunctive relief as well as damages . 31. The Declaratory and Injunctive Relief Classes are defined as: 1) the parents of the New Mexico children who are or will be subject to the loss of the ability to exhibit their animal (s) at the junior livestock competition of the New Mexico State Fair , and 2) healthcare Case 1:21-cv-00783 Document 1 Filed 08/19/21 Page 6 of 26 -App. 188 - 7 workers, congregate care workers and workers in the Office of the Governor who are or will lose their livelihoods if the y decline to receive the EUA vaccines or decline to share their vaccination status . B. RULE 23(A)(1): NUMEROSITY 32. The class is so numerous that joinder is impracticable. 33. The individuals in the class represented by Plaintiff Valdez are parents of children that will be punished for their parents exercising their fundamental liberty interest to raise their children in the way they see fit and whose children's contracts to exhibit their animal in competition at the State Fair will be i mpaired by the actions of the State of New Mexico acting through Defendants. 34. The individual s in the class represented by Plaintiff Blackford are employees that will lose their employment in their chosen professions because they have elected not to receive the EUA vaccinations mandated by the State of New Mexico acting through Defendants. 35. The total number of individuals in each of the classes will separately number in the 100's if not the 1000's in the case of the Blackford class. C. RULE 23(A)(2): COMMONALITY 36. Common questions of law or fact exist as to all members of the classes. 37. All class members seek relief on the common legal question of whether New Mexico's actions violate their constitutional or statutory rights . 38. All class members also prese nt common factual questions. 39. All members of the declaratory and injunctive relief class seek relief on the common legal question of whether a declaratory judgment and injunctive relief are appropriate relief for the asserted constitutional (both federal and state) violations. Case 1:21-cv-00783 Document 1 Filed 08/19/21 Page 7 of 26 -App. 189 - 8 D. RULE 23(A)(3): TYPICALITY 40. Plaintiff s' claims are typical of the claims of other respective members of the classes. 41. Like all members of the classes, Plaintiffs claim that the actions of the Governor, and her Secretary of Health are depriving the m of equal protection, due process of law and of constitutional protections for their preexisting contracts . 42. Like all members of the declaratory and injunctive relief class, Plaintiffs seek a declaratory judgment that t he actions of the Defendants are unlawful and unconstitutional and an injunction preventing the Defendants from continuing any such action. 43. There is nothing distinctive about Plaintiffs claim for declaratory relief or injunctive relief that would lead to a different result in their case than in any case involving other class members. E. RULE 23(A)(4): ADEQUACY 44. Plaintiffs are adequate representatives of the classes because their interest in the vindication of their constitutional and statutory rights is entirely aligned with the interests of the other class members, each of whom has the same constitutional or statutory claims. 45. Plaintiffs are a member of the respective classes, and their interests do not conflict with those of the other class members with respect to any claims. 46. Plaintiff s are represented by attorneys from Western Agriculture, Resource and Business Advocates, LLP who have extensive experience litigating complex civil rights matters in federal court and detailed knowledge of New Mexico's law and other relevant issues. 47. Class counsel has undertaken a detailed investigation of New Mexico's policies, practices, and procedures as they relate to federal constitutional requirements. 48. Class counsel has developed and continues to develop relationships with Plaintiff s Case 1:21-cv-00783 Document 1 Filed 08/19/21 Page 8 of 26 -App. 190 - 9 and others similarly situated. The interests of the members of the class will be fairly and adequately represented by Plaintiffs and their attorneys. F. RULE 23(B)(2): DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF CLASS 49. A class action is appropriate for the declaratory and injunctive relief class under Rule 23(b)(2) because Defendants have acted on grounds that apply generally to the classes \u2014 namely the Governor's PHO interferes with the statutory and constitutional rights of the members of the class . 50. The classes seek declaratory and injunctive relief to enjoin the State of New Mexico acting through her Governor and the Secretary of Health from denying class members their fundamental liberty interest in engaging in the profession o f their choosing, to raise their children as they see fit and to have their existing contracts performed without interference from the state . 51. Class status is particularly appropriate because there is an acute risk that any individual class member's claim f or declaratory and injunctive relief will become moot before the litigation is finally resolved. G. RULE 23(B)(3): DAMAGES CLASS 52. Both classes of Plaintiffs will have suffered either or both the loss of employment and the loss of the benefits of their contrac ts. COUNT I: VIOLATION OF FEDERAL FOOD, DRUG AND COSMETIC ACT 53. Plaintiffs incorporate the preceding paragraphs as though fully set forth herein. 54. The Mandatory COVID -19 Vaccination Directive issued by Defendants is in direct violation of Federal law, specifically 21 U.S. Code \u00a7 360bbb -3 - Authorization for medical products for use in emergencies. That law states that where a medical product is \"unap proved\" then no one may be mandated to take it. At Section (e)(1)(A) of the a forementioned statute it Case 1:21-cv-00783 Document 1 Filed 08/19/21 Page 9 of 26 -App. 191 - 10 states: With respect to the emergency use of an unapproved product, the Secretary, to the extent practicable given the applicable circumstances describe d in subsection (b)(1), shall, for a person who carries out any activity for which the authorization is issued, establish such conditions on an authorization under this section as the Secretary finds necessary or appropriate to protect the public health, i ncluding the following: a. Appropriate conditions designed to ensure that the health care professionals administering the product are informed - b. of the significant known and potential benefits and risks of the emergency use of the product, and of the extent to which such benefits a nd risks are unknown; and c. of the alternatives to the product that are available, and of their benefits and risks. d. Appropriate conditions designed to ensure that individuals to whom the product is administered are informed \u2014 e. that the Secretary has authori zed the emergency use of the product; f. of the significant known and potential benefits and risks of such use, and of the extent to which such benefits and risks are unknown; and g. of the option to accept or refuse administration of the product, of the conse quences, if any, of refusing administration of the product, and of the alternatives to the product that are available and of their benefits and risks. (emphasis added). Id. (emphasis added) 55. The Defendants violated at least two quoted sections ( a and c). The Defendants did not advise Plaintiffs of the \"known and potential benefits and risks of such emergency use of the product, and of the extent to which such benefits and risks are unknown\" of the COVID -19 experimental vaccine. 56. It is unlawful and highly questionable for the Defendants to require the Plaintiffs or their children to take the emergency experimental vaccine after more than 1.5 years have elapsed since the event giving rise to the emergency occurred. COUNT II: VIOLATION OF EQUAL PROTECTION - 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 57. Plaintiffs incorporate the preceding paragraphs as though fully set forth herein. 58. The Equal Protection Clause requires governments to act in a rational and Case 1:21-cv-00783 Document 1 Filed 08/19/21 Page 10 of 26 -App. 192 - 11 nonarbitrary fashion. 59. Defendants ' actions create a class of individuals who, though they are exempted by federal law from being required to receive the vaccine , or enjoy a fundamental liberty interest in raising their children in the manner they deem fit , are punished for being unvaccinated and discriminated against without any rea l justifiable basis and without providing them any alternative . 60. The PHO is not rationally related to achieving a compelling government purpose. 61. Defendants' actions are and have been therefore a violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. COUNT III - SUBSTANTIVE DUE PROCESS - 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 62. Plaintiffs incorporate the preceding paragraphs as though fully set forth herein. 63. The Plaintiffs have protected liberty interest s in their right to live without arbitrary governmental interference under the Fourteenth Amendment, to bodily integrity under the Fourth Amendment , to raise their children as they see fit and to engage in their chosen professions under the Fourteenth Amend ment . 64. Substantive Due Process prevents the government from engaging in conduct that \"shocks the conscious\" or that interferes with fundamental liberty without narrowly tailoring such interference to achieve a compelling government interest which must withs tand strict scrutiny . 65. Defendants' actions constitute official policy, custom and practice of the State of New Mexico. Defendants' actions are not narrowly tailored as many individual s similarly situated to Plaintiffs are covid -recovered and the actions vi olate federal law which requires that it must be an option not to be required to receive the vaccination . 66. Defendants' actions do not comport with the traditional ideas of fair play and decency. Case 1:21-cv-00783 Document 1 Filed 08/19/21 Page 11 of 26 -App. 193 - 12 67. Plaintiffs have the right to pursue lawful employment as they shall determine and be free of unreasonable governmental interference. 68. The PHO imposed by the Defendant will cause Plaintiffs and other similarly situation citizens of New Mexico to lose their livelihoods and to suffer the loss of their bodily integrity . COUNT IV - PROCEDURAL DUE PROCESS - 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 69. Plaintiffs incorporate the preceding paragraphs as though fully set forth herein. 70. The Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution forbids a state from depriving anyone of life, liberty, or pro perty without due process of law. 71. No due process protections have been afforded to Plaintiffs, or any citizen of New Mexico , as required by the United States Constitution of a pre -deprivation or post deprivation process that allows for any opportunity, muc h less a meaningful opportunity, to be heard and address the propriety of the government's actions. 72. All fundamental rights comprised within the term liberty, including but not limited to, the rights to be free from bodily restraint, the right to contract and engage in the common occupations of life, the right to acquire useful knowledge, to worship God according to the dictates of one's own conscience, and to generally enjoy the privileges long associated with the rights of free people are guaranteed subst antive due process rights under the Fourteenth Amendment. 73. The August 17, 2021 Order deprives Plaintiffs, and many residents of New Mexico, of fundamental liberties without due process of law, based solely upon discretion of the Defendants. COUNT V - VIOLA TIONS OF U.S.C.A. C ONST. ART. I \u00a7 10 74. Plaintiffs incorporate the preceding paragraphs as though fully set forth herein. Case 1:21-cv-00783 Document 1 Filed 08/19/21 Page 12 of 26 -App. 194 - 13 75. The actions of Defendants to penalize parents and children including Plaintiff Valdez and others similarly situated that have previously elected not to vaccinate themselves or their children by excluding them from the benefits open to all to participate in the New Mexico State Fair constitutes a bill of attainder. 76. The actions of Defendants to exclude Plaintiff Valdez, her children and others similarly situated impairs the contract established with consideration exchanged between them and Expo New Mexico to participate in the New Mexico State Fair junior livestock competitions. 77. The actions of Defendants to require the termination of unvaccinated individuals that do not meet or request an exemption impair Plaintiff Blackford's employment contract and others similarly situated. 78. Plaintiff and others similarly situated have been damaged by these actions of Defendants and are entitled compensatory and punitive damages in an amount to be proven at trial. COUNT VI - VIOLATION OF RIGHTS SECURED BY THE NEW MEXICO CONSTITUTION UNDER THE NEW MEXICO CIVIL RIGHTS ACT NMSA 1978 \u00a7 41 - 4A-3 (PEND ENT JURISDICTION) 79. Plaintiffs incorporate the preceding paragraphs as though fully set forth herein. 80. Plaintiffs enjoyed a right to bodily integrity under Article II S ection 10 of the New Mexico Constitution. 81. Defendants ' actions to unreasonably and contrary to federal law requir e that EUA vaccine injection be mandatory in order to maintain employment or enjoy the benefits of an existing contract violates Art. II Sec. 1 0. 82. Plaintiffs enjoy a right to due process and equal protection under Article II Section 18 of the New Mexico Constitution. 83. Defendants ' actions to unreasonably and contrary to federal law require that EUA Case 1:21-cv-00783 Document 1 Filed 08/19/21 Page 13 of 26 -App. 195 - 14 vaccine injection is mandatory in order to maintain employment or enjoy the benefits of an existing contract deprived Plaintiffs of their owing due process and discriminated against them on the basis of the individual choice to vaccinate themselves or their children. 84. Plaintiffs enjoy a right to co ntract free from government impairment Article II Section 19 of the New Mexico Constitution. 85. Defendants ' actions to unreasonably and contrary to federal law require that EUA vaccine injection is mandated impair the existing employment contracts of Plainti ff Blackford and others similarly situated and impairs the contracts of Plaintiff Valdez and her children as well as others similarly situated to exhibit their animals at the State Fair in violation of the New Mexico Constitution's Bill of Rights . 86. The viol ation of rights secured by the New Mexico Constitution is actionable under the New Mexico Civil Rights Act NMSA \u00a7 41 -4A-1 et seq. which provides for damages and attorney's fees for violations of those rights in an amount to be proven at trial. JURY DEMA ND Plaintiffs request a trial by a jury of twelve (12) persons. REQUEST FOR RELIEF WHEREFORE, Plaintiffs demand judgment in their favor, against Defendants jointly and severally, and seek relief as follows: (1) a Declaratory Judgment that issuance and enforcement of the August 17, 2021 Public Health Order requiring certain professions be vaccinated is unconstitutional for the reasons stated herein, and that the actions of the Defendants were unlawful and unconstitutional ; (2) a Declaratory Judgment that iss uance and enforcement of the August 17, 2021 Case 1:21-cv-00783 Document 1 Filed 08/19/21 Page 14 of 26 -App. 196 - 15 Public Health Order excluding families from the New Mexico State Fair Ground contracted to exhibit animals in the junior livestock competitions is unconstitutional for the reasons stated herein, and that the act ions of the Defendants were unlawful and unconstitutional ; (3) a temporary restraining order to prohibit Defendants from enforcing public health orders against the Plaintiffs and other putative class members that are similarly situated (4) a preliminary and perm anent injunction to prohibit Defendants from enforcing public health orders in the arbitrary and capricious manner and fashion engaged by Defendants (5) a declaration that the rights of the Plaintiffs and the citizens of New Mexico have been violated by the v arious actions of the Defendants and the said Defendants are enjoined from engaging in such violations and declaring them to be null and void ab initio; (6) award of costs and expenses, including reasonable attorneys' fees under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 and 1988; and , (7) actual and punitive damages; and (8) such other relief as this Court deems appropriate. REQUEST FOR TEMPORARY RESTRAING ORDER COVID -19 Investigational Vaccine Not Approved by the FDA On December 11, 2020, the United States Food and Drug Administration (\"FDA\") issued the first emergency use authorization (\"EAU\") for an experimental vaccine for the prevention of coronavirus disease 2019 (\"COVID -19\"). Emergency use authorization is not an FDA approval. Case 1:21-cv-00783 Document 1 Filed 08/19/21 Page 15 of 26 -App. 197 - 16 The experimental vaccine has been in existence for less than a year. The first reported use of the experimental vaccine was December 14, 2020. It is undisputed that the vaccine being forced upon Plaintiffs is \"unapproved\". Even though the F DA granted emergency use authorization for the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna vaccines in December 2020, the clinical trials the FDA will rely upon to ultimately decide whether to license these and other COVID -19 experimental vaccines are still underway and a re designed to last for approximately two (2) years to collect adequate data to establish if these vaccines are safe and effective enough for the FDA to approve. The abbreviated timelines for the emergency use applications and authorizations means there is much the FDA does not know about these products even as it authorizes them for emergency use, including their effectiveness against infection, death, and transmission of SARS -CoV -2, the virus that is allegedly the cause of the COVID disease. Given the unc ertainty about the COVID -19 experimental vaccines, the FDA requires that each dose of the experimental vaccine shall have a label that states that the product is an emergency use authorization, that the EU A is explicit that each is \"an investigational vacc ine not licensed for any indication\" and that all \"promotional material relating to the Covid -19 Vaccine clearly and conspicuously...state that this product has not been approved or licensed by the FDA, but has been authorized for emergency use by FDA\". (E xhibit \"A -1\", EAU letter for Pfizer). The FDA on their website has stated the following: \"FDA believes that terms and conditions of an EAU issued under section 564 preempt state or local law, both legislative requirement and common -law duties, that impose different or additional requirements on the medical product for which the EAU was issued in the context of the emergency declared under section 564... In an emergency, it is critical that the conditions that are part of the EAU or an order or waiver issued pursuant to section 564A - those that FDA has determined to be necessary or appropriate to protect the public health -be strictly followed, and no additional conditions be imposed.\" In August 2020, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (\"CDC\") published a meeting of the Advisory Committee on Immunizations and Respiratory Diseases, D r. Amanda Case 1:21-cv-00783 Document 1 Filed 08/19/21 Page 16 of 26 -App. 198 - 17 Cohn stated (@1:14:40): \"I just wanted to add that, just wanted to remind everybody, that under an Emergency Use Authorization, an EAU, vaccines are not allowed to be mandatory. So, early in the vaccination phase, individuals will have to be co nsented and they won't be able to be mandated.\" Here, Plaintiffs are in imminent and immediate danger of being terminated from their jobs for refusing to take an experimental vaccine that is being provided under an EAU. COVID -19 Vaccine was Rushed On Ja nuary 30, 2020, the World Health Organization (\"WHO\") declared a \"public health emergency of international concern over the global outbreak\" of COVID -19. Among other recommendations, WHO called for the accelerated development of \"vaccines\", therapeutics an d diagnostics.\" The following day, U.S. Health and Human Services ('HHS\") Secretary, Alex Azar, declared a national Public Health Emergency (\"PHE\") retroactive to January 27, 2020, \"to aid the nation's healthcare community in responding\" to COVID -19. By th en, HHS was already collaborating with the pharmaceutical industry regarding the development of vaccines. In April 2020, the National Administration announced Operation Warp Speed (\"OWS\") - a public/private partnership to develop and distribute a vaccine for COVID -19 by the end of 2020 or early 2021. The process for developing a vaccine normally takes place in several phases, over a period of years. The general stages of the development cycle for a vaccine are: 1. Exploratory stage; 2. Pre-clinical stage (animal testing); 3. Clinical development (human trials - see below); 4. Regulatory review and approval; 5. Manufacturing; and 6. Quality control9 9 https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/basics/test -approve.html. Case 1:21-cv-00783 Document 1 Filed 08/19/21 Page 17 of 26 -App. 199 - 18 The timeline set by OWS telescoped what would normally take years of research into a matter of m onths. Commercial vaccine manufacturers and other entities proceeded with the development of COVID -19 vaccine candidates using different technologies including RNA, DNA, protein, and viral vectored vaccines. Two potential vaccines emerged early on as likel y candidates: one developed by Moderna (\"Moderna Vaccine\") and the other by Pfizer (\"Pfizer Vaccine\") with both announcing Phase III trial results in November 2020. In early 2021, Janssen Biotech, Inc., submitted Phase III trial results for its adenovirus vector vaccine (\"Janssen Vaccine\"). Experimental COVID -19 Vaccines Have Not Received Final Approval from the FDA - Plaintiffs are not given a choice on whether or not they want to participate in this experimental trial. None of the currently available exp erimental vaccines for COVID -19 has received final approval from the FDA. Rather, each one of the COVID -19 experimental vaccines is an unapproved product that has been granted EAU. The FDA refers to the COVID -19 experimental vaccine as \"investigational pro ducts\", meaning they remain classified as experimental. The statute granting the FDA the power to authorize a medical product for emergency use requires that the person being administered the unapproved product be advised of his and her right to refuse ad ministration of the product. See 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 360bbb 360bbb -3\"). Additionally, terms and conditions of EAUs preempt state and local laws that would impose obligations that are inconsistent with those terms and conditions. Here, Defendan ts do not inform Plaintiffs of their right to refuse administration of the experimental vaccine. In fact, Plaintiffs are not given a choice as to whether or not they want to participate in the experimental vaccine trials. The only choice the Plaintiffs hav e is to join the experimental trial and be injected with the experimental vaccine or be fired. Case 1:21-cv-00783 Document 1 Filed 08/19/21 Page 18 of 26 -App. 200 - 19 Long Standing Public Policy Against Forcing Plaintiffs to Participate in Vaccine Trial Section 360bbb -3 reflects a fundamental, public policy goal of striking a balance between giving people the option of having access to experimental medical products during public emergencies, while also assuring that no one is forced to accept administration of such and the experimental medical product. Section 360bbb \u2014further recognizes the well -settled doctrine that medical experiments, better known in modern parlance as \"clinical research\", may not be performed on human subjects without the express, informed consent of the individual receiving treatment. Plaintiffs Have a Liberty Interest in Engaging in Their Chosen Profession That Requires Due Process of Law Before They are Deprived of Liberty. Plaintiffs have a liberty interest in engaging in their chosen profession . Defendants disagree because otherwise their actions most certainly run afoul of the Due Process Clause's protections by depriving Plaintiff s in the manner they did of their ability to earn a livelihood in the occupation of their choosing.10 For example, the United States Supreme Court in Barry v. Barchi has opined as to the constitutionally protected property interest in engaging in one's chosen profession of horse racing, stating \"Plaintiffs have a liberty interest in pursuing their profession of horse racing and are entitled to due process of law i f they are to be lawfully denied an opportunity to do so.\" Barry v. Barchi, 443 U.S. 55, 64, 99 S.Ct. 2642, 61 L.Ed.2d 365 (1979). Thus, the right of citizens to support themselves by engaging in a chosen occupation is deeply rooted in our nation's legal a nd cultural history and has long been recognized as a 10 \"The right to work, I had assumed, was the most precious liberty that ma n possesses. Man has indeed as much right to work as he has to live, to be free, to own property. The American ideal was stated by Emerson \u00b7 in his essay on Politics, 'A man has a right to be employed, to be trusted, to be loved, to be revered.' It does ma ny men little good to stay alive and free and propertied, if they cannot work. To work means to eat. It also means to live. For many it would be better to work in jail, than to sit idle on the curb. The great values of freedom are in the opportunities affo rded man to press to new horizons, to pit his strength against the forces of nature, to match skills with his fellow man.\" Barsky v. Board of Regents of University of State of New York, 347 U.S. 442, 472 (1954) (Douglas, J, dissenting). Case 1:21-cv-00783 Document 1 Filed 08/19/21 Page 19 of 26 -App. 201 - 20 component of the liberties protected by the Fourteenth Amendment. Over a century ago, the Supreme Court recognized that \"[i]t requires no argument to show that the right to work for a person living in t he common occupations of the community is of the very essence of the personal freedom and opportunity that it was the purpose of the [Fourteenth] Amendment to secure.\" Truax v. Raich , 239 U.S. 33, 41, 36 S.Ct. 7, 60 L.Ed. 131 (1915) (holding that a state a nti-alien labor statute violated both equal protection and due process). Later, in striking down a law banning the teaching of foreign languages in school, the Supreme Court observed that the Fourteenth Amendment guaranteed the right, inter alia , \"to engag e in any of the common occupations of life ....\" Meyer v. Nebraska , 262 U.S. 390, 399, 43 S.Ct. 625, 67 L.Ed. 1042 (1923). Despite later jurisprudence following the Lochner era, Lochner v. New York , 198 U.S. 45, 25 S.Ct. 539, 49 L.Ed. 937 (1905), de -emphas izing economic substantive due process, our Supreme Court has never repudiated the recognition that a citizen has the right to work for a living and pursue his or her chosen occupation. The Third Circuit has recognized \"[t]he right to hold specific private employment and to follow a chosen profession free from unreasonable governmental interference comes within both the 'liberty' and the 'property' concepts of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments.\" Piecknick v. Comm. of Pa. , 36 F.3d 1250, (3d. Cir. 1994 ) (citing Greene v. McElroy , 360 U.S. 474, S.Ct. 1400, 3 L.Ed.2d (1959); Truax U.S. at 41, 36 S.Ct. 7). However, [t]he Constitution only protects this liberty from state actions that threaten to deprive persons of the right to pursue thei r chosen occupation. State actions that exclude a person from one particular job are not actionable in suits ... brought directly under the due process clause. It is the liberty to pursue a calling or occupation, and not the right to a specific job, that i s secured by the Fourteenth Amendment. Id. (internal citations and quotation marks omitted). There is no question, then, that the Fourteenth Amendment recognizes a liberty interest in citizens \u2014the Plaintiffs here \u2014to pursue their chosen Case 1:21-cv-00783 Document 1 Filed 08/19/21 Page 20 of 26 -App. 202 - 21 occupation. The dis positive question is not whether such a right exists, but rather, the level of infringement upon the right that may be tolerated. Although federal courts have recognized the existence of a substantive due process right of a citizen to pursue a chosen occup ation for over a century, there is little specific analysis on how that right should be weighed and what sort of test should be applied to allegedly infringing conduct. Plaintiffs do not dispute that as a matter of general consensus, courts generally treat government action purportedly violating the right to pursue an occupation in the same light as economic legislation and use the general standard of review applied to substantive due process claims. In reviewing a substantive due process claim, the \"criter ia to identify what is fatally arbitrary differ depending on whether it is legislation or a specific act of a government officer that is at issue.\" Cty. of Sacramento v. Lewis , 523 U.S. 833, 118 S.Ct. 1708, 140 are also known as \"executive acts\" in substantive due process jurisprudence. The Third Circuit has explained that \"executive acts, such as employment decisions, typically apply t o one person or to a limited number of persons, while legislative acts, generally laws and broad executive regulations, apply to large segments of society.\" Nicholas v. Pa. State Univ. , 227 F.3d 133, 139 n.1 (3d. Cir. 2000). Substantive due process challen ges to a legislative act that do not implicate a fundamental right are reviewed under the rational basis test. Dias v. City & Cty. of Denver , 567 F.3d 1169, 1182 (10th Cir. 2009 ). Moreover, the United States Constitution is unequivocal in Art. I Section 10 that the State (here New Mexico) may not enact Bills of Attainer or impair existing contracts, yet that is exactly the harm that Defendants visit on the these Plaintiffs by punishing Plaintiff Valdez and her children for not being vaccinated as well as ot hers similarly sit uated including impairing their contracts with Expo New Mexico or impairing the employment contract of Plaintiff Blackford and other Case 1:21-cv-00783 Document 1 Filed 08/19/21 Page 21 of 26 -App. 203 - 22 similarly situated by requiring that employers terminate them from their chosen professions if they are n ot vaccinated. A Temporary Restraining Order is Necessary to Prevent Irreversible Harm Unless the Court enters this Temporary Restraining Order and Preliminary Injunction, New Mexicans will be forced to take a n experiential vaccine in order to retain their employment and will forever lose the ability to exhibit their unique animals at the New Mexico State Fair . This government edict is punitive toward New Mexican's who have not yet been vaccinated or refuse to be vaccinated and to have their children vaccin ated with an experimental EUA vaccine . I. Standards for Issuance of a Preliminary Injunction A movant may obtain a preliminary injunction if: (1) the movant will be irreparably injured by denial of the relief; (2) the movant's injury outweighs any damage the injunction may cause the opposing party; (3) granting the preliminary relief would not be adverse to the public interest; and (4) there is a substantial likelihood of success on the merits. Keirnan v. Utah Transit Auth., 339 F.3d 1217, 1220 (10th Cir. 2003) (citation omitted). For the reasons that follow, the standards for granting a temporary and preliminary injunction have been met in this case. II. Plaintiffs are Likely to Succeed on the Merits. A. Defendants' Public Health Order Violates the Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses , the Fourth Amendment's protection of Bodily Integrity as well as Article I Section 10 and the c orresponding New Mexico Constitution provision in the Bill of Rights . To determine whether a government act violates the substantive component of the Due Process Clause or the Equal Protection Clause, courts begin by determining the proper level of scrutiny to apply for review. \"Even though citizens of statutory counties are not a suspect class, we will still apply strict scrutiny if the state's classification burdens the exercise of a fundamental Case 1:21-cv-00783 Document 1 Filed 08/19/21 Page 22 of 26 -App. 204 - 23 right guaranteed by the U.S. Constitution. Save Palisade FruitLands v. Todd , 279 F. 3d 1204, 1210 (10th Cir. 2002). An act passes strict scrutiny only if it \"narrowly tailored to further a compelling government interest.\" Id. \"If no heightened scrutiny applies, the statute need only be rationally related to a legitimate government purpose .\" Id. \"In deciding whether to recognize additional classifications as suspect, courts traditionally look to see if the classification is 'based on characteristics beyond an individual's control,'[] and whether the class is 'saddled with such disabilities, or subjected to such a history of purposeful unequal treatment, or relegated to such a position of political powerlessness as to command extraordinary protection from the majoritarian political process.'\" Id. (citations omitted). III. The Plaintiffs Will Suff er Irreparable Injury if Injunctive Relief Is Denied The loss of [constitutional] freedoms, for even minimal periods of time , unquestionably constitutes irreparable injury.\" Heideman v. S. Salt Lake City , 348 F.3d 1182, 1190 (10th Cir. 2003) ( quoting Elrod v. Burns , 427 U.S. 347, 373 (1976)) (emphasis added); Plaintiffs if they are forced to be vaccinated face the harsh reality of being terminated from their employment and from engaging in their chosen profession. There is no adequate legal rem edy for these \"intangible harms .\" Cmty. Television of Utah, LLC v. Aereo, Inc. , 997 F. Supp. 2d 1191, 1210 (D. Utah 2014) (\"Rather, the court looks to intangible harms that are difficult to quantify when it determines whether irreparable harm warrants a pr eliminary injunction). Moreover, deprivation of constitutionally protected rights \u2014including the rights to due process and equal protection \u2014 inexorably creates irreparable harm. See Elrod v. Burns 427 U.S. 347, 373 (1976).; see also Kikumura v. Hurley , 242 F .3d 950, 963 (10th Cir. 2001) (\"When an alleged constitutional right is involved, most courts hold that no further showing of irreparable injury is necessary.\") (citations omitted). Case 1:21-cv-00783 Document 1 Filed 08/19/21 Page 23 of 26 -App. 205 - 24 The fact that Due Process and Equal Protection rights are burdened if not outright denied , as they are in this case , establishes the preliminary injunction 's \"irreparable harm\" standard. Thus, under the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals' jurisprudence, irreparable injury has occurred and will continue to occur until an injunction issues. IV. The Balance of Harms Favors Issuance of Injunctive Relief Plaintiff has established both likelihood of success on the merits as well as a clear irreparable injury. In addition, the balance of harms tips decidedly in favor of Plaintiff. In the Tent h Circuit, \"the [government's] potential harm must be weighed against [plaintiffs'] actual [constitutional] injury.\" Summum v. Pleasant Grove F.3d 1044, 1056 (10th Cir. 2007) rvs'd other grounds by 555 U.S. 460 (2009). Where the government's perception of harm is speculative and when the state permits the same speculative harm in other places , as it is here, such speculative harm cannot outweigh an injury to the Due Process, Equal Protection and State Constitutional Education rights of plainti ffs who have established a substantial likelihood of success on the merits. If preliminary injunctive relief is not granted, and the Court later finds that the challenged laws impermissibly infringe constitutional rights, the Plaintiffs will have suffered irreparable harm. After the fact , this Court will be unable to make things right again. By contrast, if th is Court grants preliminary injunctive relief and later finds against the Plaintiff, the Defendants will not have suffered any hardship that the Defe ndants do not currently countenance in the operation of hospitals, schools and other entities. Because the Defendants will not suffer more than speculative harm if an injunction is granted, and the Plaintiffs will suffer certain harm in the absence of injunctive relief, the balance of hardships favors the Plaintiff. When plaintiffs establish that a case raises constitutional issues, as the Plaintiffs have in this case, the Court should presume that the Case 1:21-cv-00783 Document 1 Filed 08/19/21 Page 24 of 26 -App. 206 - 25 balance of harms tips in their favor. Sammartano v. Fir st Judicial District Court , 303 F.3d 959, 973 (9th Cir. 2002). V. An Injunction Is in the Public Interest Finally, Plaintiff establish es that issuance of a preliminary injunction is in the public interest. The Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals recognizes \"it is always in the public interest to prevent the violation of a party's constitutional rights .\" Verlo v. Martinez , 820 F.3d 1113, 1127 (10th Cir. 2016) ; citing Pacific Frontier v. Pleasant Grove City , 414 F.3d 1221, 1237 (10th Cir. 2005); ., 256 F.3d at 1076; Elam (10th Cir.1997) . The vaccine is experiential, and an individual is not required by law to receive a vaccine in the experiential stage. It is in the public interest to not allow government to mandate what we put into our bodies, especially when dealing with an experientia l vaccine for which we do not know the long-term effects. CONCLUSION French mathematician and philosopher, Blaise Pascal, stated that \"[j]ustice without force is powerless; force without justice is tyrannical .\" This Court should give force to justice an d for all the foregoing reasons, Plaintiff s respectfully request this Court grant a Temporary Restraining Order.

ORDER THIS MATTER comes before the Court on Plaintiffs' Verified Class Action Complaint for Civil Rights Violations Under 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1983; Violations of Ri ghts Protected by the New Mexico Civil Rights Act; Emergency Request for a Temporary Restra ining Order; Request for Preliminary Injunction, Permanent Injunctive Relief and Damages (the \"Complaint\"). Doc. 1. Although Plaintiffs did not file a separate motion requesting emergenc y relief, the Complaint requests \"a temporary restraini ng order to prohibit Defendant s from enforcing public health orders against the Plaintiffs and other putative cl ass members that are similarly situated,\" and a preliminary injunction \"to prohibit Defendants fro m enforcing public health orders in the arbitrary and capricious manner and fashion engaged by Defendants.\" Id. at 15. The Court finds it appropriate to set an expedited briefing schedu le on Plaintiffs' request for preliminary relief, rather than issue an emergency order on an ex parte basis. Case 1:21-cv-00783-MV-JHR Document 3 Filed 08/23/21 Page 1 of 4 -App. 221 -On August 17, 2021, New Mexico Department of Health Acting Secretary David R. Scrase, M.D. issued \"Public Health Emergenc y Order Requiring All School Workers Comply with Certain Health Requiremen ts and Requiring Congregate Care Facility Workers, Hospital Workers, and Employees of the Of fice of the Governor Be Fully Vaccinated\" (\"PHO\"). Doc. 1- 2. In relevant part, the PHO requires all \"hospital workers . . . to be fully vaccinated against COVID-19 unless they qualify for an exemption.\" Id. at 3-4. The PHO also requires that \"[a]ll persons who are eligible to receive a COVID-19 vaccine and enter the grounds of the New Mexico State Fair . . . provide adequate proof of being fully vaccinated against COVID-19 . . . unless the individua l qualifies for an exemption.\" Id. at 5. Both Hospital workers and individuals who seek entry into the State Fair \"may be exempt from the COVID-19 vaccination requirement . . . if they have a qualifying medical condition wh ich immunization would endanger their health, or they are entitle d . . . to a disability-related reasonable accommodation or a sincerely held religious belief accommodation.\" Id. at 4, 5-6. A religious belief exemption may be supported by \"a statement rega rding the manner in which the administration of a COVID-19 vaccine conflicts with the religious observan ce, practice, or belief of the individual.\" Id. at 4-5, 6. Named Plaintiff Jennifer Blackford is a regi stered nurse employed by Presbyterian. Doc. 1-3 \u00b6 2. She asserts that the P HO \"requires that [she] be termin ated if [she] refuse[s] to be vaccinated for COVID-19,\" and that based on he r \"medical training and her own independent research,\" she is \"opposed to re ceiving the EUA covid vaccines.\" Id. \u00b6\u00b6 4-5. Named Plaintiff Talisha Valdez, along with her 11- and 12-year ol d daughters, has contracted to exhibit their animals at the New Mexico State Fair. Doc. 1-4 \u00b6\u00b6 2, 6. She asserts that the PHO \"prohibits [her] and [her] children from attending the New Me xico State Fair and showing their animals,\" and that she has chosen \"not to be vaccinated\" and \"to re fuse to have [her] child injected with an Case 1:21-cv-00783-MV-JHR Document 3 Filed 08/23/21 Page 2 of 4 -App. 222 -experimental EUA vaccine.\" Id. at \u00b6\u00b6 9, 12. Together, Plaintiffs allege that, unless this Court enters a temporary restraini ng order and preliminary injunctio n, under the PHO, \"New Mexicans will be forced to take an expe rimental vaccine in order to retain their employment and will forever lose the ability to exhibit their unique anim als at the New Mexico Stat e Fair.\" Doc. 1 at 22. This Court is authorized to issu e a temporary restraining orde r \"without written or oral notice to the adverse party or its attorney\" only if two conditions are met: (1) \"specific facts in an affidavit or a verified compla int clearly show that immediate and irreparable injury, loss, or damage will result to the movant before the adverse party can be heard in opposition\" and (2) \"the movant's attorney certifie s in writing any efforts made to give notice and the reasons why it should not be required.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 65(b)(1). Here, Plaintiffs' attorn ey did not certify in writing any efforts to give notic e or the reasons why notice shoul d not be required. There is no record on the docket that Defenda nts have so far been served. Nor would Plaintiffs' service alone satisfy the requirements of Rule 65(b)(1). Further, the Cour t finds that the facts alleged by Plaintiffs do not clearly show that immediate and irreparable injury, loss, or damage will result to Plaintiffs before Defendants can be heard in opposition. While alleging that the PHO would prevent Blackford from retaini ng her employment and Valdez from entering the State Fair, the Complaint ignores the existence of the exemptio ns to the PHO's vaccination requirements. As noted above, the PHO allows for three exemptions to the vaccination re quirements for hospital workers and State Fair attendees, including an exemption that can be supported by a mere statement as to the manner in which the administr ation of a vaccination conf licts with the beliefs of the individual. The Complaint provides no factual allegations as to why none of the exemptions would apply to the named Plaintiffs, both of whom have clearly asserted that administration of the COVID-19 vaccine does, i ndeed, conflict with their beliefs. Because Case 1:21-cv-00783-MV-JHR Document 3 Filed 08/23/21 Page 3 of 4 -App. 223 -Plaintiffs have made no effort to seek an exemption to the vaccination re quirement and thus have no reasonable basis to conclude that they will lose their employment and/or be denied entry to the State Fair, the Court finds no grounds to issu e an order without providi ng Defendants with an opportunity to respond. It will , however, order an expedited briefing schedule on Plaintiffs' request for a preliminary injunction. IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED that: 1. Plaintiffs must effect service of a copy of this Order, togeth er with the Complaint [Doc. 1], and any attachments thereto, to be received by Defendants no later than 5:00 p.m. Mountain Time (\"MT\") today, Monday, August 23, 2021, notwithstanding any previous attempts made by Plaintiffs to serve Defendants. Proof of any service done pursuant to this Order shall be filed with the Clerk of Court as soon as practicable. 2. If Defendants oppose Plaintiff's Motion, a written response shall be filed with the Court and served on Plaintiffs no later than Monday, August 30, 2021 at 5:00 p.m. MT. 3. Plaintiffs' reply, if any, shall be filed with the Cour t and served on Defendants no later than Wednesday, September 1, 2021 at 5:00 p.m. MT. 4. The Court will set a hearing on this matter if it finds that such a hearing is necessary. DATED this 23rd day of August 2021.

OPPOSED1 MOTION TO RECONSIDER THE COURT'S ORDER OF AUGUST 23, 2021 COMES NOW Plaintiffs hereby respectfully move this Court to reconsider its August 23, 2021 Order. This matter comes before the Court on Verified Class Action Complaint for Civil Rights Violations Under 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1983; Violations of Rig hts Protected by the New Mexico Civil Rights Act; Emergency Request for a Temporary Restraining Order; Request for Preliminary Injunction, Permanent Injunctive Relief and Damages (the \"Complaint\"). Doc. 1. LAW REGARDING MOTIONS TO RECONSIDER Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 54(b) provides that a district court can freely reconsider its prior rulings and puts no limit or governing standard on the district court's ability to do so, other than that it must do so \"before the entry of judgment.\" Kruskal v. Martinez , 429 F. Supp. 3d 2019), citing Fed. R. Civ. P. 54(b). \"[D]istrict courts generally remain free to 1 Counsel for Defendants has been consulted and is opposed to this motion. Case 1:21-cv-00783-MV-JHR Document 4 Filed 08/23/21 Page 1 of 5 -App. 225 - 2 reconsider their earlier interlocutory O.K. Indus -19 Inve stigational Vaccine Not Approved by the FDA As of the filing of this Motion the FDA has only approved the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine. However, the Plaintiff in this matter specifically Plaintiff Valdez and her children will still suffer harm. In order to be considered fully vaccinated it must have been 2 weeks since your second Pfizer shot.2 Thus, if a child receives their first shot on August 18, 2021 (the day following issuance of the PHO) that child is not fully vaccinated and able to enter the New Mexic o State Fair Grounds until September 22, 2021, which is 3 days after the New Mexico State Fair ends. Furthermore, the one -time dose produced by Johnson and Johnson has not yet been approved for individuals under the age of 18.3 Furthermore, the Moderna CO VID-19 Vaccine requires 2 shots 28 days apart and has not been approved for individuals under the age of 18.4 On December 11, 2020, the United States Food and Drug Administration (\"FDA\") issued the first emergency use authorization (\"EAU\") for an experime ntal vaccine for the prevention of coronavirus disease 2019 (\"COVID -19\"). Emergency use authorization is not an FDA approval. The experimental vaccine has been in existence for less than a year. The first reported use of the experimental vaccine was Decemb er 14, 2020. It is undisputed that the vaccine being forced upon Plaintiffs is \"unapproved\". Even though the FDA granted emergency use authorization for the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna vaccines in December 2020, the clinical trials the FDA will rely upon to ultimately decide whether to license 2 https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019 Filed 08/23/21 Page 2 of 5 -App. 226 - 3 these and other COVID -19 experimental vaccines are still underway and are designed to last for approximately two (2) years to collect adequate data to establish if these vaccines are safe and effective enough for the FDA to approve. The abbreviated timelines for the emergency use applications and authorizations means there is much the FDA does not know about these products even as it authorizes them for emergency use, including their effectiveness against infection, d eath, and transmission of SARS -CoV -2, the virus that is allegedly the cause of the COVID disease. Given the uncertainty about the COVID -19 experimental vaccines, the FDA requires that each dose of the experimental vaccine shall have a label that states tha t the product is an emergency use authorization, that the EUA is explicit that each is an investigational vaccine not licensed for any indication and that all promotional material relating to the Covid -19 Vaccine clearly and conspicuously...state that this product has not been approved or licensed by the FDA, but has been authorized for emergency use by FDA The FDA on their website has stated the following: \"FDA believes that terms and conditions of an EAU issued under section 564 preempt state or local law, both legislative requirement and common -law duties, that impose different or additional requirements on the medical product for which the EAU was issued in the context of the emergency declared under section 564... In an emergency, it is critical that the conditions that are part of the EAU or an order or waiver issued pursuant to section 564A - those that FDA has determined to be necessary or appropriate to protect the public health -be strictly followed, and no additional conditions be imposed.\" In August 2020, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (\"CDC\") published a meeting of the Advisory Committee on Immunizations and Respiratory Diseases, D r. Amanda Cohn stated (@1:14:40): \"I just wanted to add that, just wanted to remind everybody, that under an Emergency Use Authorization, an EAU, vaccines are not allowed to be mandatory. So, early in the vaccination phase, individuals will have to be co nsented and they won't be able to be mandated.\" Here, Plaintiffs are in imminent and immediate danger of being terminated from their jobs for refusing to take an experimental vaccine that is being provided under an EAU. Case 1:21-cv-00783-MV-JHR Document 4 Filed 08/23/21 Page 3 of 5 -App. 227 - 4 Immediate and irreparable injury , loss, or damage will result to Plaintiffs if the Court does not grant a temporary restraining order. Plaintiff Blackford and many like her face immediate threat of being terminated from their employment when they will not seek or are not eligible for an exemption . Plaintiff Blackford is not seeking an exemption therefore leaving her only two options: 1) Termination or 2) getting the vaccine.5 The Court has misapprehended that the Plaintiffs are seeking or are eligible for an exemption and thus are in ac tuality facing termination because they do not fall under one of the exemptions in its Order of August 23, 2021 . Furthermore, Plaintiff Valdez and her children will suffer as the only vaccine the children are eligible for is the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine whi ch cannot be fully administered until after the New Mexico State fair has ended. Plaintiff respectfully request that Court recognize that the threat of harm is imminent and that no exemption available to these Plaintiffs will save them from the irreparabl e harm of the loss of Constitutional freedoms that goes into effect on August 27, 2021. CONCLUSION The Plaintiff respectfully moves the Court to reconsider its August 23, 2021 order and grant the Plaintiff the relief they so desperately need as a temporar y order until a preliminary hearing may be held .

Specifically, Plaint iffs ask the Court to reverse its decision to set an expedited briefing schedule on Plaintiffs' request for preliminary relief rather than issue an emergency order on an ex parte basis. As set forth herein, because Plaintiffs have not met the requirements of Rule 65(b)(1) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure that would entitled them to a temp orary restraining order \"without written or oral notice to the adverse party or its attorney,\" the Court declines to reconsider its decision. As noted in the August 23, 2021 Order (the \"O rder\"), in their Complaint, Plaintiffs request \"a temporary restraining or der to prohibit Defendants from enforcing public health orders against the Plaintiffs and othe r putative class members that are similarly situated,\" and a preliminary injunction \"to prohibit Defendants fro m enforcing public health orders in the arbitrary and capricious manner and fashion engaged by Defendants.\" Doc. 1 at 15.

She asserts that the PHO \"prohibits [her] and [her] children from attending the New Me xico State Fair and showing their animals,\" Case 1:21-cv-00783-MV-JHR Document 10 Filed 08/25/21 Page 2 of 6 -App. 234 -and that she has chosen \"not to be vaccinated\" and \"to re fuse to have [her] child injected with an experimental EUA vaccine.\" Id. at \u00b6\u00b6 9, 12. Together, Plaintiffs allege in their Complaint that, unless this Court enters a temp orary restraining order and prel iminary injunction, under the PHO, \"New Mexicans will be forced to take an e xperimental vaccine in order to retain their employment and will forever lose the ability to exhibit their unique animals at the New Mexico State Fair.\" Doc. 1 at 22. In the Order, this Court explained that it is authorized to issue a temporary restraining order \"without written or oral no tice to the adverse party or its attorney\" only if two conditions are met: (1) \"specific facts in an affidavit or a verified compla int clearly show that immediate and irreparable injury, loss, or damage will result to the movant before the adverse party can be heard in opposition\" and (2) \"the movant's attorney certifies in writing any efforts made to give notice and the reasons why it should not be required.\" Doc. 3 at 3 (quoting Fed. R. Civ. P. 65(b)(1)). The Court further explained that Plain tiffs had not met either of these requirements. Specifically, Plaintiffs' attorney di d not certify in writing any effort s to give notice or the reasons why notice should not be required, and there was no record on the docket that Defendants had been served. Doc. 3 at 3. Further, the Court f ound that the facts as alle ged by Plaintiffs did not clearly show that immediate and irreparable injury , loss, or damage would result to Plaintiffs before Defendants can be heard in opposition. Id. The Court stated that, while alleging that the PHO would prevent Blackford fr om retaining her employment and Valdez from entering the State Fair, the Complaint ignored the existen ce of the exemptions to the PHO's vaccination requirements. Id. As noted above, the PHO allows for th ree exemptions to the vaccination requirements for hospital workers and State Fair attendees, including an ex emption that can be supported by a mere statement as to the manner in which the administra tion of a vaccination conflicts with the beliefs of th e individual. The Complaint provi ded no factual allegations as to Case 1:21-cv-00783-MV-JHR Document 10 Filed 08/25/21 Page 3 of 6 -App. 235 -why none of the exemptions would apply to the named Plaintiffs, both of whom, in connection with this case, have asserted that administrati on of the COVID-19 vaccine does, indeed, conflict with their beliefs. Id. The Court concluded that, because Pl aintiffs made no effort to seek an exemption to the vaccination requi rement and thus had no reasonable basis to conclude that they would lose their employment an d/or be denied entry to th e State Fair, the Court found no grounds to issue an order without providing Defendants with an opportu nity to respond. Id. at 4. Because of the time-sensitive nature of this case, however, the Court ordered an expedited briefing schedule on Plaintiffs' request for a preliminary injunction. Id. On the instant motion, Plaintiffs ask the C ourt to reconsider it s decision, arguing that \"[i]mmediate and irreparable injury, loss, or damage will result to Plaintiffs if the Court does not grant a temporary restraining order. \" Doc. 4 at 4. In support of this argument, Plaintiffs claim that, in discussing the exemptions to the vacc ine requirement, the Cour t has \"misapprehended that the Plaintiffs are seeking or are eligible for an exemption and thus in actuality facing termination because they do not fall under one of the exemptions in its Order of August 23, 2021.\" Id . The Court did not misunderstand Plaintiffs' position, but rather found, and continues to find, that Plaintiffs have not sufficiently shown that they will suffer imme diate and irreparable injury, loss, or damage before Defe ndants can be heard in opposition. In connection with the motion to reconsider, Blackford asserts (for the first time) that she does \"not meet the criteri a for either a medical ex emption or a religious ex emption.\" Doc. 4-1 \u00b6 5. But Plaintiffs have provided no factual basis for this conclusory assertion. Indeed, as noted in the Order, Blackford and Valdez both state in their original affidavits that administration of the COVID-19 vaccine conflicts with their individual beliefs. Plaintiffs concede that they have made no effort to seek an exemption to th e vaccination requirements based on those stated beliefs. Having made no such effo rt, Plaintiffs have no reasonable basis to conclude that none of Case 1:21-cv-00783-MV-JHR Document 10 Filed 08/25/21 Page 4 of 6 -App. 236 -the exemptions would be available to them. And in the absence of any s howing that none of the exemptions would be available to them, Plaintiffs cannot establis h that enforcement of the PHO puts them at risk of immediate harm. In short, Plaintiffs can not make their own emergency by refusing to even so much as pursue the exemptions afforded under the PHO. In further support of the inst ant motion, Blackford asserts th at she has \"been told that [she] will not be allowed to cont inue in [her] employment without a vaccine.\" Doc. 4-1 \u00b6 5. However, Blackford's employer, Presbyterian - separate and apart from the PHO - has instituted its own private vaccine mandate, requiring that its entire workforce be vaccinated against COVID-19 in the absence of a qualifying exempti on. Given Presbyterian' s mandate, Plaintiffs' evidence falls short of showing that, by granti ng Plaintiffs' request fo r an emergency order enjoining enforcement of the PHO, this Court would be able to save Blackf ord from the threat of termination from her employment. Nor does the Court find availing Plaintiffs' cla im that \"Plaintiff Valdez and her children will suffer [if a temporary order is not issued] as the only vaccine the child ren are eligible for is the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine which cannot be fully administrated until after the New Mexico State fair has ended.\" Doc. 4 at 4. In sett ing an expedited briefing schedule, the Court was mindful that the New Mexico State Fair begins on September 9, 2021. Br iefing on Plaintiffs' request for preliminary injunctive relief will be completed no later than September 1, 2021, eight days before the State Fair begi ns. Accordingly, the Court's deci sion to allow Defendants to be heard in opposition before deciding whether to en join enforcement of the PHO will not result in irreparable harm to Valdez and her children. Finally, nowhere in their motion to reconsider do Plaintiffs address their failure to meet the second condition for obtaining emergency ex parte relief, namely, a written certification by their attorney stating \"any efforts made to gi ve notice and the reasons by it should not be Case 1:21-cv-00783-MV-JHR Document 10 Filed 08/25/21 Page 5 of 6 -App. 237 -required.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 65(b)(1). Because Plai ntiffs failed to meet this condition and have provided no basis for that failure, their motion to reconsider must also fail. This Court is cognizant of its inherent authority to recons ider its non-final orders. Plaintiffs have provided no basis fo r the Court to use that authority to reconsider its decision to refrain from issuing an order enjoining enforcemen t of the PHO without providing Defendants with an opportunity to respond. The briefing schedule set in the Orde r remains in effect. IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED that Plaintif fs' Opposed Motion to Reconsider the Court's Order of August 23, 2021 [Doc. 4] is DENIED. DATED this 25th day of August 2021. M A R T H A V \u00c1 Z Q U E Z United States District Judge Case 1:21-cv-00783-MV-JHR Document 10 Filed 08/25/21 Page 6 of 6 -App. 238 - "}
