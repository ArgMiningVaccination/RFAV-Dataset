I am very grateful to the people that've worked on vaccines worldwide. My symptoms are comparable to a mild flu, but if I hadn't had a vaccine & booster, I'm sure it would have been much worse. Thank you! Claiming that someone has light symptoms because they are vaccinated creates a false sense of security. There are still many vaccinated people that are dying from Covid every day. We need to stop telling vaccinated people they are safe. It makes them reckless. Further, there is no logic in the assumption that symptoms are light because of the vaccine, which is similar to unvaccinated people who got sick and recovered quickly claiming that they recovered because they were not vaccinated. In any case, we all need to be careful regardless of the vaccine, common sense is the first line of defense. I wish you a speedy recovery, you get well! So, assuming this is your first time getting Covid: You did not get the very grave Alpha or Delta before being vaccinated. You then got two vaccinations AND a booster. You got Omicron with mild symptoms. And yet you state the outcome now would have been worse without the vaccines.... Do you see the very obvious flaw in your thinking? Non-falsifiable hypothesis. Not wise to write 'I'm sure'. How would you grade a student who expresses 100% certainty in a non-falsifiable hypothesis? Get well soon.

I will not recommend people to not to take their Shot. As people say even though they are vaccinated still they are getting infected. It's best to take your vaccine and not mislead others to not get vaccinated. Get well soon professor Ng, but based on which data you are sure that you have mild symptoms because of taking vaccine? PS. I am not anti-vaccin and I have taken vaccine as well, I am asking data wise Vaccines are great. If we did not have vaccines like Polio, BCG, DPT, MMR, many would die of these diseases too early. We all hope/wish these vaccines are as effective as the legacy ones, and is not being commercialised. I had Covid. It was mild, no vaccines whatsoever. I am sure if I had one I would have still gotten it. The difference is that I am most likely done. Read "}
