Cleaning any child's teeth can be difficult, but a squirmy baby's can be extremely challenging. It is best to start cleaning your baby's mouth even before the first tooth comes in, around six months. Always start with washing your hands. There are many types of toothbrushes and gum cleaners in stores but we have found that a baby's washcloth works best. Wrap the washcloth around your index finger and wet it. Gently wipe the baby's gums and teeth with your covered finger. This is the time when your baby wiggles, squirms, and whines. Don't give up! Hold the baby in a cradle-hold with one of their arms around your back and your arm cradling their head while holding their other arm - this should help! Clean your baby's mouth every night before bed after their last feeding. This can also help to be a sign to your baby that it is time for sleep. Good luck and do not give up! Why is it that some people never get cavities and others seem to get cavities overnight? To begin to understand this, it is important to understand how a cavity is made. First, you need to start with bacteria, those tiny germs that are everywhere but we cannot see them. There are several different kinds of bacteria, but the one that lives in the mouth and causes cavities is called Strep. mutans. The Strep. mutans bacteria needs food to live, as do all things, and Strep. mutans loves sugary, sticky carbohydrates. Things like gummy worms, soda, cookies, and cake are Strep. mutans foods of choice. When people eat these kinds of foods, this bacteria eat it too. When Strep. mutans chows down, it makes an acid-like substance and this acid eats away at the teeth. The more Strep. mutans and sugary foods equals more cavities. If you do not want cavities, your first step is to get rid of the bacteria. This is where a toothbrush and floss are handy. A toothbrush brushes away plaque, the sticky stuff which helps to hold Strep. mutans to your teeth. Floss gets in-between the teeth where food, plaque, and Strep. mutans hide out. Fluoride toothpaste makes a fluoride \"shield\" on the tooth, which makes it harder for the acid to form a cavity. By not eating sugary foods, the bacteria will not have a food source, so this will also help. People who do not get cavities do not have a lot of Strep. mutans living in their mouths. They could eat all the wrong things and still not get a cavity because they do not have the bacteria in their mouth to make the acid. People who have a lot of bacteria in their mouths need to be the best brushers and flossers and eat a very healthy diet. Plus, they have to be careful because they can share the bacteria with other people by sharing food, drinks, toothbrushes, etc. Remember, you cannot brush away a cavity. Only your dentist can clean out a cavity and fill in the hole so bacteria and food do not collect again. Everyone should have their teeth checked regularly, so cavities and other oral diseases can be detected early.
