I know how frustrated you can feel when something like that happens, especially when we strongly believe in our vision and in our dreams. Today I would like to share, a few helpers from nature to assist you in attracting success and prosperity. Let's see how nature can help you, by learning what we need to know about magical herbs for success. Contents Magick of herbs Let's start by emphasizing that everything used in magic has its own power. The [resins](https://magickalspot.com/resin/) with which you prepare incense. The herbs you use during a spell or a ritual. The candles you light and the oils you sprinkle them with. What you write, pronounce, create, manipulate. But this alone is not enough to create the desired effect. [It is first of all the intention](https://magickalspot.com/magic-intention-explained/), but also (before, during, and after the spell) that you practically move towards your goal. Burning mixtures to attract success, if nobody knows about your project because you have never promoted it, will give little results. Just as it makes no sense to wear laurel talismans to pass university interviews and exams if you don't study. [Before using herbs to attract wealth,](https://magickalspot.com/herbs-for-prosperity-money/) success, or any other desire, thoroughly investigate why you are asking for their help. When loading your mixes, try to be specific about what you want to achieve. After that, get busy: study, interview, work hard to achieve your goal. Herbs will help you. But they won't do the work for you. Magic, that everything that is natural and, in its own way, lives, walks, breathes or expresses its presence to the world, is a single note that composes the overall melody. This is why Magic is not made, it is lived: because we, too, are part of it. And living the Magic means learning to listen, understand, and speak the language of the World, its melody. As creatures of Nature, herbs are also part of the Magic and contribute to making the melody of the world wonderful. They have their own language, so silent to our ears as to be imperceptible. But the problem is not them, it is we who no longer remember how to listen. Herbs are alive, and they carry in their DNA the experience of thousands of years on Earth: if you can talk to them, and be convincing, it may be that they will teach you something. Yes, I know. You have probably never taken into consideration the idea that the rosemary jar that adorns your balcony is the recipient of millennial knowledge. Yet, it brings into its structure, just like us, the experience of millennia spent in dialogue with the Wind, the Sun, and the Rain.

Remember that in Magic everything is an exchange: energy is not created and cannot be destroyed. To get something from it, you will need to be able to give it the same. So, first, take some time to hear and understand her language. Spend time in nature to connect with it and to truly be mindful when harvesting herbs. I love to say thank you when harvesting the herbs I want to use in magic and meditation by holding them between my hands so we can connect energetically and create a bond. Especially when it comes to success, we are often driven to do things easily and quickly to get immediate success. This is so wrong. To truly let the magical herbs for success work and manifest the positivity you need, try to embrace an open and mindful mindset and approach throughout the process. I highly recommend you try to grow herbs yourself or harvest them from nature. Did You Know? I was honored when I was recently asked by Court TV producers to consult on a case.

The Romans created laurel wreaths to celebrate winners and victors. Tradition revived, albeit with a different meaning, even in the Middle Ages, where the laurel wreath began to spread as a celebration of new doctors (hence the term graduation). When burned or scattered like dust, it is perfect for purifying environments and warding off unaligned energies. The manner in which the leaves burn can be telling: if they crackle brightly, the initiative will be successful. If not ... better prepare a plan b. In my opinion, however, laurel is best used in spells to promote the success and success of our desire. It is a plant linked to victory, in physical and economic terms. If I had to describe the laurel with an image, I would surely associate it with an arrow: precise, well-calibrated, which reaches the target without too many frills.

To create a bag with magickal herbs for yourself you need: - A rectangular piece of yellow fabric - Some [magickal herbs](https://magickalspot.com/green-magic/)for success - A ribbon (Optional) How to create one? Fold the rectangular piece of fabric in half, sew the edges, leaving one side open to which insert the herbs. Insert the herbs into the open side. Now you close the bag with a ribbon or even sew the remaining side closed. As you can see, the preparation is simple. They are usually carried in your pocket, in your wallet, or they can be arranged in the house, under kitchen counters, in corners, or at the door. Furthermore, to enhance a bag, stones can be inserted, which have a similar purpose. My favorite ingredients to add to a witchy bag that attracts success are: - 3 coins - 1 crystal of your choice - Chamomile flower heads - Poppy seeds I mix all these together, put the mixture inside of the bag, and keep it in a hidden place like my handbag or even my closet. Ritual with magickal herbs for success This ritual is amazing to attract success by using powerful magickal herbs. Perform it on a Sunday, as this is the best day to cast this spell and perform rituals related to success and triumph. Ingredients: [A green candle](https://magickalspot.com/green-candle-meaning-spells/) - A pin to engrave - A piece of paper - A green ribbon - A [stick of incense](https://magickalspot.com/using-incense-sticks/) - A pin or needle [Cloves](https://magickalspot.com/clove-magical-properties/) [Mint](https://magickalspot.com/mint-magical-properties/) - Olive oil Light the incense and leave it to create a soothing relaxing atmosphere to perform the ritual. Spend a few moments visualizing yourself as a successful person, imagine you have already accomplished what you want, and notice how excited and satisfied you feel. Bring this feeling with you while performing this ritual, to attract this exact vision and make it come true in your life. When you are ready, take the candle and horizontally engrave your name at the top with the help of the pin or needle. Prepare the success potion with magickal herbs by mixing the ingredients in a bowl (the olive oil, mint, and [cloves)](https://magickalspot.com/cloves/). Anoint the candle with this potion starting from the wick, motioning towards the center of the candle, and then from the bottom towards the center. Tie the green ribbon around the candle. Write your wish on the sheet of paper being very clear and specific about the goal you want to achieve. Now put the paper under the candle holder. Now repeat seven times: \"The success I desire is more alive than ever, now it shines and shines like a light that sparkles and soon comes to me. So, I want, so it will be\" Let the candle burn for an hour, then extinguish it. Relight the candle, for seven evenings in a row, and on the last evening, let it burn out until it is entirely consumed. Next, fold the sheet of paper, and tie it as if it were a small package and carry it with you, (either in your purse or on yourself). You should then bury the remains of the green candle, under a green plant. Also read: [How to Use Green Candle to Attract Money?
