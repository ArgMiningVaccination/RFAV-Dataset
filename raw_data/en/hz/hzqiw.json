Holistic Ayurveda can guide and support you on your journey to self-discovery and a joyful life with the help of mind coaching and kinesiology. Kinesiology: the healing spirit of energy The aim of kinesiology is to dissolve energy blockages and restore the free flow of energy. A kinesiologist gains insight into the body with the help of muscle-testing techniques: the body's reactions to specific stimuli help identify blockages and their locations. Exercises and effective balancing techniques help to restore energy and generate self-healing.

Attain self-determination with ESQ, holistic screening and Radical Forgiveness Scientific research into the causes of diseases and symptoms tends to neglect factors such as a patient's social environment and psychological/emotional circumstances. However, these frequently lead to physical complaints whose causes are rarely discovered. At the Ayurveda Resort Mandira, we offer ESQ, a simple screening tool to highlight emotions and complex issues that cause blockages. Radical Forgiveness, meditation, kinesiology, Yoga and our Holistic Ayurveda programmes can dissolve these blockages and activate self-healing. RADICAL FORGIVENESS COACHING Feeling tired, frustrated, angry, sad and aggrieved? Heal your relationships with others and yourself, and change how you view life! With the gentle assistance of your coach, you start to recognise the underlying assumptions and patterns of a problematic situation and learn to resolve it with the tools of Colin Tipping's Radical Forgiveness process. This revolutionary method is supported by three principles that can bring positive change to your life. - Find peace - Find self-acceptance - Radical manifestation Radical Forgiveness places a different perspective on your life, offering an alternative view of your future. Make friends with your shadow self and discover how liberating this is. When we accept and love ourselves, we experience a new life energy that allows us to actively and purposefully shape our life. We do this by using spiritual intelligence - a form of wisdom that is accessible to all of us through the medium of radical manifestation.
