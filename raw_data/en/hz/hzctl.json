Some Yoga practitioners believe that the Metatron's Cube can be used as a tool for meditation and visualization. By focusing on the geometric shapes, one can tap into the underlying structure of the universe and gain a deeper understanding of the interconnectedness of all things. This, in turn, can help to cultivate a sense of inner peace and harmony. The Metatron's Cube can help to balance the chakras, or energy centers, in the body.
