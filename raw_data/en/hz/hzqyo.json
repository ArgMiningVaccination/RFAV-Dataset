The University is informed and inspired by its Baptist heritage and three basic theologi - cal and biblical presuppositions: learning is appointed and conserved by God as essen - tial to the fulfillment of human destiny; in Christ all things consist and find ultimate unity; and the Kingdom of God in this world is rooted and grounded in Christian community. The University embraces the conviction that there is no conflict between the life of faith and the life of inquiry. To fulfill its mission, the University: presents a worldview informed by Christian principles and perspectives; affirms that truth is revelatory and transcendent as well as empirical and rational, and that all truth finds its unity in Jesus Christ; influences development of moral courage, social sensitivity, and ethical responsibility; gathers a diverse community of learners; delivers academic instruction in the liberal arts and sciences and professional preparation at both undergraduate and graduate levels through traditional, extended campus, and online programs; transfers to students the vast body of knowledge and values accumulated over the ages; encourages students to think critically and creatively; fosters the development of intellectual vitality, physical wellness, and aesthetic sensibility: forges a community of learning that is committed to the pursuit, discovery, and dissemination of knowledge; provides students with opportunities for servant leadership and community engagement, with an emphasis on underserved communities; cooperates with other educational insti - tutions to expand learning opportunities for students; offers service and other opportunities to the greater community through ath - letics, continuing education, and cultural enrichment programming. College of Pharmacy & Health Sciences The mission of Campbell University College of Pharmacy & Health Sciences (CPHS) is to educate students in a Christian environ - ment to be health care professionals who will function effectively as a part of an inter - disciplinary team of health care providers to meet existing and future health care needs and who will provide leadership to their profession and professional organizations. History On January 5, 1887, James Archibald Campbell\u2014a 26-year-old Baptist minister\u2014 welcomed 16 students to a small church in Buies Creek, North Carolina, for the first day of classes, thus marking the founding of Buies Creek Academy. From that humble beginning, Buies Creek Academy evolved to become Campbell Junior College (1926), Campbell College (1961), and Campbell Uni - versity (1979). Throughout these transfor - mations, the institution has remained true to its founding principles to address the most pressing needs of North Carolina and to educate men and women for Christian service and leadership around the world. The University enjoys an autonomous and voluntary relationship with the Baptist State Convention of North Carolina. The founding principles still guide Camp - bell University today. In 2013, Campbell launched the Jerry M. Wallace School of Osteopathic Medicine, North Carolina's first new medical school in over 35 years. In Au - gust 2016, the Catherine W. Wood School of Nursing\u2014housed within the College of Pharmacy & Health Sciences\u2014welcomed its first cohort. Simultaneously, Campbell opened its School of Engineering, which was only the second engineering school at a private university in North Carolina. They joined Campbell's other established colleges and schools: the College of Arts & Sciences, the Norman Adrian Wiggins School of Law (1976), the Lundy-Fetterman School of Business (1983), the School of Education (1985), the College of Pharmacy & Health Sciences (1985), and the Divinity School (1996). In addition to its main campus in Buies Creek, Campbell University has off-campus instructional sites in Camp Lejeune (Jack -2 | 2022-2023 A CAdemi C BUlletiNsonville), Fort Bragg & Pope (Fayetteville), Raleigh (2009 relocation of the law school), Tunku Abdul Rahman University College (Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia), and a vibrant online presence through Campbell Online. Today, Campbell University enrolls approximately 7,000 students per year, including more than 5,000 undergraduate and graduate students on its main campus. More than 100 degree programs in the liberal arts, health sciences, fine arts, and professions are offered to them, continuing Campbell's tradition of preparing students for purposeful lives and meaningful service.

The chair notifies each student who does not meet the academic standards as defined by the academic regulations at CPHS. The College's associate dean for academic affairs is also notified. Each student subject to suspension or dismissal is evaluated by the Academic Performance and Standards Committee in order to determine whether to retain or promote the student in the professional program. The student may appear in person before the committee. The chair of the Academic Performance and Standards Com - mittee notifies students in writing regarding any decision by the committee to require a modified course of study, to suspend enrollment, or to dismiss the student from the College and informs the appropriate associate dean.

The appeal letter must be received within seven business days of the notification communicating the change of academic status. Requests to attend a con - ference should be made as soon as possible and may or may not be in compliance within the 7 day window due to logistical issues. Students on probation or suspension may have their appeal letters forwarded to the Academic Performance and Standards Committee for consultation if needed. Attendance Students are required to attend at least 80% of the hours prescribed for every enrolled course in order to receive credit for the course. Individual professors have the prerogative of imposing a more restric - tive policy consistent with the following exceptions: Absence due to serious illness, injury, or death in the student's immediate family; Authorized representation of the College or University. In the above cases, a student may be permitted to make up work missed. It is the student's responsibility, whenever possible, to notify their instructors in advance that he or she will be absent. Bias i ncident Reporting Bias Incident Reporting policies and procedures are located in the University Student Handbook found in this link on the Campbell website: https://www.campbell. edu/students/student- handbook/. Citizenship Status & experiential accept applications from individ - uals who are US-born citizens, naturalized citizens, US permanent residents (a.k.a. green card holders), F1 visa holders or other study-authorized nonimmigrant status, or recipients of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrival (DACA) status. Applicants, for CPHS degrees requiring experiential education components (i.e. internships, clinical training clerkships, residencies, etc.), need to understand that clearance for the permission to participate in such experiential training is determined by the training site, not CPHS. Certain training sites have more time-consuming clearance processes, such as the Veterans Administration hospitals and other federal facilities. CPHS cannot guarantee clearance for the permission to participate in experiential GeNeRAl iNFOR mAtiON | 5training at a specific site but will work to place students at the necessary sites to complete their educational requirements. Graduation and the associated timeframes may be affected due to any delays that arise in the clearance process for the completion of training requirements. Complaints/Grievances General Complaint Procedure Students have the right to file formal written and signed complaints regarding policies and procedures of the College to the dean's office. Student complaints will be evaluated by appropriate administrators as referred by the dean. The written grievance should include the following: student name and contact information; the date of the grievance; and a description of the specific grievance. Students should expect a timely, fair, and comprehensive review of their complaints to include personal discussions with appro - priate administrators, and the opportunity to supply supportive documentation or the testimony of fellow students regarding their complaints. A formal written response to a student complaint will be provided following review by the dean and submitted to the College's Executive Committee. The student's original complaint and dean's response will be kept on file for a period of six years from the date of the dean's response and be subject to review by appropriate accreditation agencies. Formal Grievance Policy for ACPE Concerns Students who have concerns regarding the College of Pharmacy & Health Sciences' capability to achieve the standards of accreditation or comply with policies and procedures of the Accreditation Council for Pharmacy Education (ACPE) may file a grievance with the Office of Admissions & Student Affairs. Formal grievances must be submitted in writing to the associate dean of admissions & student affairs. The written grievance should include the following: student name and contact information, the date of the grievance, the specific ACPE accreditation standard, policy or procedure that is involved, and a description of the specific grievance. The grievance will be reviewed by the associate dean of admissions & student affairs and referred to the appropriate ad - ministrators for investigation, analysis, and appropriate action. Students should expect a timely, fair, and comprehensive review of their complaints to include personal dis - cussions with appropriate administrators, and the opportunity to supply supportive documentation or the testimony of fellow students regarding their concerns. Students will be notified regarding the outcome of the review and any actions planned or taken.

Criminal Background Check & drug Screen Introduction Organizations involved in healthcare re - search, development and delivery are held to high degree of integrity and also have an enormous liability for the products and services they provide. In order to mitigate risk, limit liabilities and protect the safety and well-being of patients and research subjects, criminal background checks (CBCs) and substance abuse screening tests (SASTs) have evolved into required components of the employment and educational processes at most healthcare facilities and research and development organizations for employ - ees and learners. Additionally, CBCs and SASTs may be required prior to licensure to practice and may be required for currently licensed healthcare professionals as defined by the associated regulatory boards. CPHS is being required to attest that CBCs and SASTs, plus other requirements (e.g. CPR, HIPAA compliance, health insurance, immunizations, etc.) have been completed prior to health professions students (nursing, pharmacy, physical therapy and physician assistant) being allowed to engage in experiential training at the clinical educa - tion sites. Also, many sites for the BSCR and BSPS internships have such requirements. As a result of these risk management movements in the healthcare industry, these required screens have become an important part of the process for matric - ulation of candidates seeking degrees in the CPHS undergraduate and professional degree programs. If accepted applicants or current students in CPHS programs are not eligible for entry to the appropriate training sites in order to perform the mandatory experiential component(s) as required to complete their degree, then they are not eligible for matriculation at entry and/ or progression through their designated program. Individuals in the graduate clinical research, pharmaceutical sciences 6 | 2022-2023 A CAdemi C BUlletiNor public health programs may be subject to CBCs, SASTs or similar aforementioned requirement as a component of any current or future required or elective experiential trainings. Beginning in the academic year 2016-2017, the cost of all CBCs and SASTs became the responsibility of the individual accepted applicant/current student in the specified Campbell University CPHS program. Prior to students being permitted to participate in experiential education courses (clerkships, internships, etc.), they must submit to updated CBCs and SASTs. Individuals who: do not consent to the required screening (CBC, SAST, etc.) refuse to provide information necessary to conduct these screens in required time frame provide false or misleading information in regard to the CBC and SAST attempt to manipulate body fluid samples in the screening process do not complete the screening obli - gation in a timely manner and by the required deadlines may lose their status of good standing and will be referred to the appropriate CPHS committee for actions as related to professional behaviors. Sanctions may include loss of eligibility: to receive university scholarships to hold leadership positions to receive CPHS funding for professional meetings to participate in experiential education activities and are subject to sanction up to and including dismissal from the college in accordance with CHPS policies. Information from the updated CBCs and SASTs are kept as confidential as possible and are retained in a file separate from other educational and academic records. Information will be shared with the CPHS Experiential Education Committee, the Associate Dean for Admissions & Student Affairs and with clinical education sites if there is a need to determine the acceptability of a student to the site. Additional Considerations Admitted students cannot refuse assignment to a particular experiential site because they do not wish to submit to further substance abuse testing or criminal background checks required by the site. The designated experiential faculty member will evaluate alternate placement options and feasibility for any CPHS student who is refused admission to a training site, or who is asked to leave a site because of information discovered through the screening process for experiential training (CBC, SAST, or other background requirement). However, no guarantee of alternate placement can be made. CPHS does not accept responsibility to continually seek educational training sites who will accept CPHS students previously denied access to any assigned site. CPHS does not accept responsibility for any student being ineligible for course - work, training, continued enrollment in the college, or subsequent licensure for any reason, including failure to pass a CBC and/ or SAST regardless of whether or not the student has participated in a corrective action plan attempting to make them acceptable to experiential education training sites. Criminal Background Check Policy for Campbell University Health Programs CPHS requires criminal background checks (CBCs) of all nursing, pharmacy, physical therapy and physician assistant program applicants who earn acceptance into their respective health programs prior to matriculation. Current and BS in Pharma - ceutical Sciences programs may be required to have a CBC, prior to matriculating into the mandatory senior internship. Currently, applicants and students enrolled in the MS in Clinical Research, MS in Pharmaceutical Sciences and MS in Public Health degree programs are not required to complete CBCs; however, CPHS graduate students who participate in any experiential training experience, required or elective, may be subject to a CBC as part of the process for entrance to the training site. Accepted applicants to any of the afore - mentioned CPHS degree programs will be notified of the background check require - ment as part of the application/ interview/ orientation process. Failure to disclose any convictions or pending charges may result in reconsideration of an applicant's admis - sions status. Current students are required to notify the designated experiential faculty member within three (3) business days of any new relevant criminal convictions or pending charges acquired since enrollment. Those students who fail to disclose new charges or convictions within three (3) business days may result in reconsideration of a student's enrollment status. CPHS will contract with an outside vendor for the performance of the background check, and students will be responsible for the cost of the testing. Educational training sites may require CPHS to provide them with a copy of the results of any criminal background check performed on students prior to and for the duration of their placement at the site. Some clinical training sites may also require a CBC of their own in addition to the CBC completed by CPHS. Clinical education sites may set their own standards in regard to who they will admit based on the results of the criminal background screening or require further screening. Students must be willing to disclose and release the required personal information and CBC results in order to participate in clinical education activities. Students who are not willing to allow the release of the required personal informa - tion will not be able to be placed at an affiliated clinical education site, and thus cannot meet the requirements to continue their education and fulfill the curriculum requirements for graduation. Charges and convictions do not automat - ically prevent an applicant or current student from matriculating into or continu - ing in a CPHS degree program at Campbell University. Any charges or convictions as described above must be reviewed for potential impact on the individual's eligi - bility for placement at experiential training sites to perform the necessary clinical activities or internship requirements for the successful nursing, pharmacy, physical therapy and physician assistant students will also be required to have a CBC annually or as often as required by experiential sites. Students enrolled in the BS in Clinical Research completion of the applicable CPHS program and ultimately licensure eligibil - ity for the individuals enrolled in health professions programs. In certain cases, the criminal record may prevent the student from being able to meet the requirements for progression through a program or ability to graduate. Any organization that provides an experiential training site for student internships and/or clinical training experi - ences has the right to review all CBC results, and ultimately has the right to accept or deny the placement of any CPHS student based upon these results. Procedure 1. A criminal background check will be completed on: all accepted applicants to the CPHS health professions programs prior to matriculation, all current health professions students annually and/or as GeNeRAl iNFOR mAtiON | 7required by clinical sites, and any CPHS undergraduate student (BSCR/BSPS) as necessitated for internship placement. 2. Applicants accepted late in the admis - sions cycle will be given a date for com - pletion of all testing. Failure to complete required testing in the specified time period may result in reconsideration of an applicant's admissions status. 3. Accepted applicants and selected wait listed applicants will receive a letter from the College with detailed information about these requirements. The letter will explain the contingency that the final decision regarding matriculation will be made after review of the applicant's criminal background check report. 4. Appropriate authorization, with perti - nent identifying information necessary to initiate the check, will be received from each accepted applicant prior to initiating a criminal background check. This authorization will inform the ac - cepted applicant that he or she will have access to criminal background check data about himself or herself to ensure the accuracy of the criminal background check report. 5. CPHS contracts with an outside vendor for the performance of the criminal background check. Results are sent di - rectly from the vendor to the designated program representative(s) for review. 6. Recommendations regarding matric - ulation of an accepted applicant or continuation of a current student whose criminal background check reveals infor - mation of concern will be made by the CPHS Experiential Education Committee. 7. No information derived from a criminal background check will automatically disqualify any accepted applicant from matriculation or prevent progression of a current student. 8. Decisions about matriculation or contin - uation in a health program will be made only after a careful review of factors including: the nature, circumstances and frequency of any offenses, length of time since the offenses, documented successful rehabilitation if required, the accuracy of the information provided by the applicant in his or her application materials, and/or compliance with policy related to reporting court dates and their decisions. 9. Information from these reports that is unrelated to decisions about admissions and continued enrollment will be maintained in the Office of the Dean and will not become part of the student's permanent file.10. Information obtained will only be used in accordance with state and federal laws. 11. Due to the potential impact of clinical placements, enrolled health professions students or those currently granted a deferral or alternate course of study are required to self-report any new charges or convictions to the designated program representative within three (3) business days. 12. For current health professions students, failure to disclose new criminal charges within three (3) business days to the designated experiential faculty member may result in program specific action and/or referral to the appropriate CPHS committee for possible professional behavior violations. 13. Current students must notify their designated experiential faculty member of scheduled court dates no greater than one week prior to the hearing. 14. Current students must notify their des - ignated experiential faculty member of any court decisions and provide official court documents of the case outcome within one week. 15. Students, who receive court convictions during their enrollment in CPHS health programs, will be required to obtain updated CBCs as necessitated at their expense. 16. All criminal background data will be maintained in a secure location to assure confidentiality. Routine access to the information will be limited to staff members in the office of Admissions & Students Affairs, the associate dean of admissions & student affairs, and directors/ coordinators of experiential education in each health program. Substance Abuse Screening Protocol CPHS requires substance abuse screening tests (SASTs) of all nursing, pharmacy, physical therapy and physician assistant program applicants who earn acceptance into their respective health programs prior to matriculation. Current nursing, pharmacy, physical therapy and physician assistant students will also be required to have a SAST annually or as often as required by experiential sites, in addition to random or just cause SASTs. Students enrolled in the BS in Clinical Research and BS in Pharmaceutical Sciences programs may be required to have a SAST, prior to matriculating into the mandatory senior internship and may be required to submit to random or just cause SASTs. Currently, applicants and students enrolled in the MS in Clinical Research, MS in Pharmaceutical Sciences and MS in Public Health degree programs are not required to complete SASTs; however, CPHS graduate students who participate in any experiential training experience, required or elective, may be subject to a SASTs as part of the process for entrance to the training site. Accepted applicants to any of the afore - mentioned CPHS degree programs will be notified of the background check and substance abuse screening protocol requirement as part of the matriculation process. Additional screening tests may be required as determined by CPHS or the experiential training sites. SAST results may be reviewed the CPHS admissions office, the CPHS Experiential Education Committee, the Student Conduct and Professionalism Committee (if necessary), the designated experiential education office and the des - ignated experiential training sites providing student internships and clinical experiences for CPHS programs. It is extremely impor - tant to note an understand that the affiliate rotation/internship/clinical/ experiential sites, not CPHS, ultimately have the ability to accept or deny the placement of any student based upon the SAST results even after acceptance into the program. Consumption of alcohol is not permitted during classes, experiential or co-curricular activities. CPHS reserves the right to require drug or alcohol testing on any currently enrolled CPHS student (BS, MS or doctoral) when based on unusual or erratic behavior or reasonable suspicion exists that a student is under the influence of drugs or alcohol. Examples of reasonable suspicions include but are not limited to a formal or public complaint issued by students, faculty, or staff, and/or physical proof. Refusal or failure to submit to screening may result in disciplinary action up to and including dismissal. Students found to have screening tests positive for alcohol, illicit substances or prescription medications without a valid prescription will have results evaluated by the CPHS Experiential Education Committee with possible referral to the appropriate CPHS professionalism committee for possible disciplinary action up to and including dismissal as warranted by CPHS administration. Educational training sites may require CPHS to provide them with a copy of the results of any substance of abuse tests performed on students prior to and for the duration of their placement at the site. Some clinical training sites may also require a SAST of their own in addition to the SAST completed by CPHS. Clinical education sites reserve the right to set their own standards in regard to who they will admit based on the results of the substance abuse screening or require further screening. Students who are not 8 | 2022-2023 A CAdemi C BUlletiNwilling to allow the release of the required personal information will not be able to be placed at an affiliated clinical education site, and thus cannot meet the requirements to continue their education and fulfill the curriculum requirements for graduation. A positive drug/alcohol screen may require the student to be evaluated and receive counseling. In this case, the student may be evaluated by a qualified clinician in the Campbell University behavioral health center, or they can opt to be evaluated at a community behavioral health agency/ practice. Should the student opt to use a behavioral health center other than Campbell, the student will be responsible for the cost of evaluation and the associat - ed therapy. All students will be responsible for ensuring that all necessary documen - tation is provided to the College regarding attendance at a behavioral health center. Procedure 1. The currently approved urine substance abuse screening test will be completed at a designated lab facility with results sent directly to the current Campbell University vendor. SASTS will be per - formed on all accepted applicants prior to matriculation and on current health programs' students at least annually. 2. The letter sent by the respective program to each accepted applicant, as well as to selected wait-listed applicants, will include information about these requirements with the contingency that the final decision regarding matriculation being made after institutional review of the accepted applicant's SAST report. 3. Appropriate authorization, with perti - nent identifying information necessary to initiate the test, will be received from each accepted applicant and current student prior to initiating a SAST. 4. Accepted applicants and current students must have the sample collected at a CPHS approved collection site. CPHS contracts with an outside vendor for the performance of the test. 5. Such tests will be conducted in accord - ance with the Americans with Disabilities Act and other applicable laws. Results are sent directly from the vendor to the designated CPHS Health Program representative(s) for review. 6. Applicants and current students without any abnormal SAST findings can be approved by the Admissions Office or program representative for matricula - tion or continuation in their respective program. 7. Applicants and current students with abnormal SAST findings, other than a \"negative dilute\" must undergo further review by the CPHS Experiential Educa - tion Committee. a. Applicants/current students with SAST positive results for illegal substances or non-prescribed con - trolled medications will be referred to the CPHS Experiential Education Committee with the potential for their offer of admission to be rescinded or dismissal from their current program, depending on the status of the student. b. Applicants/current students with a SAST result of \"negative dilute\", MUST repeat the SAST at their expense. A second negative dilute result may jeopardize a student's admission or ability to continue studies in the progression of his/ her respective program. c. necessary clinical/experiential sites, the test value levels, and normative data related to drug use. d. The CPHS Experiential Education Committee reserves the right to refer students with positive SAST results for mandatory drug rehabil - itation or psychological evaluation for progression in a health program. 5. Although we acknowledge that marijua - na use is legal in several states, marijua - na is a Schedule I drug and it is currently considered ILLEGAL by the federal government and by the state of North Carolina; therefore, applicants/ current students will be held to this standard set by our federal and state government. The possession and/ or consumption of marijuana may jeopardize an appli - cant's/student's ability to matriculate and progress through the CPHS degree programs. dress Code Proper professional attire signals to patients and other health professionals a student's self-confidence, knowledge level, and willingness to participate in responsible decision-making processes. The short- length white lab coat is required for many healthcare professionals in training. Business casual attire is appropriate for classroom and examination sessions. Busi- ness casual attire includes collared shirts (with a tie in the PA program) and khaki or dress slacks or knee-length skirts or dress slacks with tailored blouses (DPT-no bare shoulders*). Closed toe shoes are required for all clinical experiences. The following dress and accessories are un- acceptable in the clinic and classroom: hats, caps, t-shirts, blue jeans, shorts, mini-skirts, visible cleavage, sweatpants, athletic attire, tank tops, bare midriffs, skintight clothing, flip flops, and visible tattoos or any body piercing (other than earrings). Special jeans days may be granted through the appropri - ate program supervisor. For laboratory training, the dress code is listed below for individual programs. It is understood that laboratory experi - ences may include time in the classroom; therefore, the proper attire for classroom instruction on laboratory days is at the discretion of the professor. For clinical/ experiential training, the dress code will be dictated by company policy. *DPT program students are to wear ap - propriate laboratory clothing under scrubs (solid color) on laboratory session days. In the following circumstances, students are to abide by the dress code above (non-lab - oratory days, outside classroom activity, practical exams, and OSCE). For experiential training, students are expected to abide by the dress code set forth by the clinical practice site or site hosting the experience. Questions about a site's dress code policy should be discussed with the program's experiential director/ coordinator and/or the preceptor/mentor. Doctor of Physical Therapy Laboratory Dress Code Laboratory clothing typically needs to allow access for easy manipulation and palpation of body parts. Therefore, wearing shorts, t-shirts, and sports bras or similar is appropriate. The following items are never appropriate in any setting: Bikini/Speedo Clothing that exposes breasts Pants below hips that expose undergar - ments Any clothing that allows for viewing of undergarments while performing job duties or classroom activities Pajamas and slippers Master of Physician Assistant Practice Laboratory Dress Code Clean scrubs are recommended for laboratory sessions. A short white lab coat and name tag are required for all clinical encounters; long hair must be pulled back. Nose, lip, and eyebrow piercings are not permitted in clinical settings. Catherine W. Wood School of Nursing Clinical Experience Dress Code While involved in clinical experiences (agency, skill, or simulation lab), the following guidelines provide the student with behavioral expectations.GeNeRAl iNFOR mAtiON | 9 The Catherine W. Wood School of Nursing uniform is to be worn for any clinical activity. Students may be required to change into hospital scrubs upon arrival to the clinical setting. In this event, the nursing uniform is worn to and from the agency. Shoes must be low heeled and black. For safety, footwear must be non- canvas with an enclosed toe and heel. The shoes can be any style black (professional or athletic) and should be worn exclusively in the clinical setting. The appropriate picture ID is visible at all times. Hair must be clean and groomed. Well maintained facial hair is the expectation. Longer hair must be off the face and pulled back into a ponytail. Nails must be short and clean to prevent injury to patients. Artificial nails are not allowed. Students must adhere to the prevailing clinical facility policies regarding jewelry. In general, a watch, flat wedding band, and single stud earrings are appropriate. Visible body piercing including tongue stud/ring, clear nasal stud, or brow jewelry is to be removed prior to patient care and not worn while in uniform. It is not acceptable to cover these areas with flesh-colored materials. Gum or tobacco products are not allowed in any professional care setting. Fragrances (i.e. perfume, cologne, scented lotions, etc.) are not permitted. early Alerts The College of Pharmacy & Health Sciences values student support and attempts to prioritize resources in order to maintain stu - dent success throughout a course. Faculty and staff members utilize the CU Succeed early alert system to submit concerns over students' academics and wellness, giving students ac- cess to resources to keep them successful. Alerts submitted may include but are not limited to class attendance, tar - diness, low test grades, referrals to service like tutoring, and more. Additional concerns can be brought to the CPHS Student Affairs office. environmental Health & Safety The College of Pharmacy & Health Sciences has the Environmental Health and Safety Committee that is responsible for updating and maintaining the laboratory safety man - ual to include policy & procedure, safety, training, storage, and disposal of hazardous chemicals. The Lab Safety Manual can be accessed in each program manager's office. Emergency contact numbers are posted in the administrative offices through the College. Training is supplied and recorded (kept in secure file cabinet in program directors' offices) for all faculty, students, and staff who participate in scholarship activities involving hazardous chemicals in laboratories. Family e ducation Rights and Privacy Act (F eRPA) Family Education Rights and Privacy Act in - formation is found in this link on the Camp - bell website: https://www.campbell. edu/ registrar/family-education-rights-and-priva - cy-act-ferpa/ . In a distance learning environment, the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA), a federal privacy law, continues to remain in effect and students need to understand their role in supporting the privacy of fellow students. As a course incorporates remote interactions, be cognizant that shared pictures, written assignments, audio, videos, emails, blog posts, discussion boards, etc. remain part of the content of the course, just as they would if they were shared in the face-to- face classroom setting, and the expectation is that each member of the class treat those materials with care and does not reshare or post beyond the course. Accordingly, any student accessing class or other educational materials on Blackboard or any other electronic media: 1. Acknowledges the faculty members' intellectual property rights and that distribution of the materials outside the course participants violates the copyright policy; and 2. Recognizes the privacy rights of fellow students who speak or appear on video in class; and 3. Accepts that recording, distributing, posting, or uploading materials to students or any other third party not authorized to receive them or to those outside the classroom is an Honor Code violation; and 4. Agrees that the materials are to be ac - cessed and used only as directed by the faculty member(s) teaching the course. Financial Aid Financial aid eligibility and status depends on the program of study and the number of credit hours enrolled. For more information regarding financial aid, full-time and part- time status, please contact the Campbell University Financial Aid Office.Grade Reports, Records & transcripts A report of grades attained by a student in the CPHS will be available through the University's Student Planner system at the end of each semester. The official records of each student in CPHS will be maintained securely in the Office of the Registrar. The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (PL93-380) will govern the release of information for this record which contains the transcript from Campbell University, transcripts and transcript evaluations from other educational agencies attended by the student, secondary school transcripts, scho - lastic aptitude, GRE, and other standardized test scores. The application for admission, general correspondence with the student and, if applicable, letters concerning mis - conduct or disciplinary actions at Campbell University are maintained by the Office of Admissions & Student Affairs within the university archival system. The transcript and contents of the permanent record may be examined by the student upon appoint - ment with the Registrar, or the associate dean for admissions and student affairs. Repeat Courses For repeat courses, the last attempt only will affect the final grade point average. Previous hours attempted, previous hours passed, and previous quality points will not be considered, although they will remain on the permanent record. All grades from all attempts are recorded and remain on the transcript permanently. Health i nsurance All CPHS health professions students are required to be actively covered by a health insurance plan. Health insurance is required by federal mandate and it enumerated as a specific requirement in the contractual agreements with our clinical experiential training sites. Any medical costs incurred by students as a result of injury, exposure to infectious diseases or materials, while in training, are the responsibility of the student and his or her health insurance carrier. International students are required to participate in the Campbell University insurance policy and will be automatically enrolled. Domestic students, with existing health insurance coverage, may opt-out of the University provided plan. To opt out, domestic students must complete a waiver and provide proof of health insurance cov - erage. Failure to execute the waiver process will result in a non- refundable charge for insurance. No waivers will be accepted beyond the August 31st deadline. More information regarding the waiver process 10 | 2022-2023 A CAdemi C BUlletiNmay be found at https://www.campbell. edu/students/student-health- insurance/ waive/ . Students may also be required to upload the necessary supporting docu - mentation verifying active health insurance coverage into the electronic management systems utilized by their respective program in order to track all experiential training requirements. Events covered under the Accidental Insurance Policy are covered in a future section. immunization North Carolina state law requires individ - uals attending a college/university to have received certain immunizations. In addition, immunizations beyond those required by the state are often required by clinical training affiliates that provide sites for experiential education. Per the Campbell University Academic Vaccination Policy (https://cufind.campbell .edu/academ - ic_policies/1/) , students currently enrolled, or seeking to enroll, in degree programs in the university requiring clinical or other ex - periential education components provided by external (non-university) partners must provide proof of being fully vaccinated in accordance with the requirements generally outlined by the specific program or have an approved exemption on file within the timeframe set by the university. While an exemption may be approved by the university, it does not guarantee that the exemption will be accepted by the clinical or other educational site During introductory and advanced practice experiences and clinical rotations, health professions students will be involved in direct patient care and incur risks of potential exposure to infectious patients and materials. All students must provide a completed medical history form and/or proof of im - munization as directed by their respective program. Students are responsible for main - taining the necessary immunizations; this requirement is mandated by CPHS in order to ensure eligibility for learners to complete all required supervised clinical practice experiences. Prior to registration, students must provide proof of the immunizations/ immunity requirements of their respective program. Failure to adhere to the vaccination requirements and associated timelines may prevent the student from participation in clinical experiences. Programs cannot guar - antee that alternate sites will be available to meet course objectives for students who are not fully immunized. Thus, the potential for a delayed graduation or inability to com - plete the CPHS program must be recognized by the student. Requirements Students should contact their respective program for a list of program-specific re - quired immunizations and any questions regarding immunization requirements. COVID-19: All health professions students are expected to be fully vac - cinated, as mentioned in the Academic Vaccination Policy and related informa - tion above. A waiver process is available. While an exemption may be approved by the university, it does not guarantee that the exemption will be accepted by the clinical or other educational site. CPHS cannot guarantee placement at a site if the student cannot show proof of immunization Standard Precautions The Center of Disease Control (CDC) has de - veloped a list of the following precautions to prevent accidental spread of infectious diseases to both students and patients: Hand washing (or using an antiseptic hand rub) -After touching blood, body fluids, secretions, excretions, and con - taminated items Immediately after removing gloves between patient contact Gloves -For contact with blood, body fluids, secretions, and contaminated items -For contact with mucous mem - branes and non-intact skin Masks, goggles, face masks -Protect mucous membranes of eyes, nose, and mouth when contact with blood and body fluids is likely Gowns -Protect skin from blood or body fluid contact -Prevent soiling of clothing during procedures that may involve contact with blood or body fluids Linen -Handle soiled linen to prevent touching skin or mucous mem - branes -Do not pre-rinse soiled linens in patient care areas Patient care equipment -Handle soiled equipment in a manner to prevent contact with skin or mucous membranes to prevent contamination of clothing or the environment -Clean reusable equipment prior to reuse -Environmental cleaning -Routinely care, clean, and disinfect equipment and furnishings in patient care areas Sharps -Avoid recapping used needles, use self-capping safety needles if available -Avoid removing used needles from disposable syringes -Avoid bending, breaking, or manipu - lating used needles by hand -Place used sharps in puncture- re - sistant containers Patient resuscitation -Use mouthpieces, resuscitation bags, or other ventilation devices to avoid mouth to mouth resuscitation Patient placement -Place patients who contaminate the environment or cannot maintain appropriate hygiene in private rooms OSHA Bloodborne Pathogens Training CPHS requires that all students who have contact with patients complete online mod - ules regarding OSHA Bloodborne Pathogens (BBP). Copies of student training records will be kept in the office of each respective professional program. Physician Assistant Students Only- Tuberculosis Training Physician assistant students will receive training for preventing the transmission of tuberculosis (TB) annually. All students who have the potential for exposure to TB may be fit tested for National Institute of Occu - pational Safety and Health (NIOSH) certified personal respirator protective devices, as required by clinical sites. These devices are considered personal protective equipment and must be purchased by the student. Personal Illness Students presenting signs or symptoms of infectious or communicable diseases have a duty not to spread illness to others. Students should consult the Student Health Center ((910) 893-1562), their preceptor, clinical supervisor or the infection control office at the clinical site about the advisabil - ity of working with patients and when it is safe to return to patient care.GeNeRAl iNFOR mAtiON | 11incident Reporting Body Fluid and Needle Stick Policy and Procedure Incidents involving needle sticks and expo - sure to body fluids or potential bloodborne pathogens require immediate action to protect students' health and safety. If a student sustains a needle stick or is exposed to infectious materials he or she should: 1. Immediately wash exposure site thor - oughly with soap and water (or water only for mucous membranes). -Wash needle stick and cuts with soap and water. -Flush the nose, mouth or skin with water. -Irrigate eyes with clean water, saline or sterile irrigants. 2. Notify the preceptor or clinical supervi - sor at the rotation site for assistance. -For pharmacy students the preceptor should notify the Office of Pharmacy Experiential Education by phone, (800) 760-9697, or email (Shawn Carrillo, ext. 1709/ Tina Thornhill, ext. 1402/email: thornhillt@campbell.edu ) as soon as reasonably possible to begin the process of filing an incident report. For physician assistant students the preceptor should notify the PA clinical coordinator by phone, (910) 893-1252 or email, gerstnerl@camp - bell.edu , or the PA department's office, (910) 893-1210, as soon as reasonably possible to begin the process of filing an incident report. 3. Seek immediate care for necessary lab work and post-exposure prophylaxis -In the event that the rotation site has an existing exposure policy, the student should comply with the site's policy. -If the rotation site is not able to as - sist the student, the student should seek care at the nearest available facility to provide appropriate care (initial lab work for HIV, HBV, HCV and risk assessment to determine the need for chemoprophylaxis, etc.) or students may be seen at Campbell University's Student Health Center. 4. The preceptor or appropriate institution - al representative should obtain consent from the source patient for appropriate laboratory testing (i.e. HIV, HBV, and HCV status). -Students should receive post- expo - sure prophylaxis within hours of the exposure rather than days, per CDC recommendations, if the status of the source patient is deemed high risk or if there is uncertainty of the source patient's status. 5. Some clinical sites will provide post- exposure care to students at no charge. When this is not the case, needle sticks and other exposure are covered under the Campbell University Student Accident Insurance Policy. Accidental infectious exposure must be reported as directed in this policy: A-G Administrators LLC. Sports Insurance Specialists PO Box 55121 Ph: (610) 933-0800 Fx: (610) @agadm.com presenting to a clinic for post- ex - posure care, the student may provide the above policy information and his or her student ID card. However, the site may or may not accept direct payment through this plan. Students may have to pay out of pocket at the time of service. However, reimbursement for services up to $5,000 per incident can be filed via the Student Health Center. Students will need: To provide an itemized statement complete with diagnosis and procedure codes. Complete a claim form either in person, or call Student Health Services at (910) 893-1560.

If requested, mail documents to: Camp - bell University Student Health Service, PO Box 565, Buies Creek, NC 27506 Students may opt to use their personal health insurance to cover the cost of post-exposure care in lieu of using the Campbell University Student Accident Insurance Policy. 6. Although, the preceptor or clinical supervisor may have contacted CPHS as indicated above, the student must also contact the Office of Experiential Education or the Physician Assistant Department Office as soon as reasonably possible but within a minimum of 72 hours of the exposure to finalize the incident report.The incident report shall contain: The date and time of exposure. Clinical site, location and unit informa - tion. Details of how the exposure occurred. Details of the type and severity of the exposure. Details about the source patient (i.e. post-exposure management, previous vaccinations, current HIV, HBV, HCV status). The Office Experiential Education or the Physician Assistant Department Office will provide a copy of the incident report to Student Health Services. This will alert the Student Health Services in the event that an accident insurance claim needs to be filled. In the event that an incident report was filed at the rotation site, a copy of this must be sent to the Office of Experiential Education or the Physician Assistant Department Office to be maintained in the student's file. In the event of an exposure, the National Clinician's Post Exposure Prophylaxis Hotline is available by phone, (888) 448- 4911, 24 hours per day, seven days per week, to provide guidance in managing exposures. inclement Weather During periods of inclement weather, classes at CPHS will meet according to the decisions made by the University. Students may monitor decisions made through the University's inclement weather website, www.campbell.ed u/weather . Students are encouraged to use their own good judgment relative to safety in traveling to campus. Should classes meet and students who commute are unable to travel safely to the campus, they will not be penalized and will be able to make-up missed work. meal Plan Campbell University Dining Services offers a variety of meal plan options that includes dining locations across campus. Visit campbell.campusdish.com for detailed meal plan information. Parking Students parking on campus are required to obtain a parking decal. Registration information, parking maps, and parking regulations are available at: https://www. campbell.edu/campus-safety/parking/ vehicle-bicycle-regi l iability i nsurance Campbell University maintains student liability insurance for all students during their clinical experiences and internships re - quired as part of their curriculum of study. This coverage is valid only during assigned clinical activities. All students and faculty members of the College while participating in a clinical experience and/ or internship as part of their curriculum of study are covered by a malpractice liability insurance policy in accordance with contractual agreements with training sites. Refunds An admissions deposit is required of each accepted applicant. These deposits are non-refundable. In the event of a student's program withdrawal from the university for a particular enrollment period, refunds/ repayments are calculated according to the Higher Education Act and its subsequent modifications. Campbell University will comply fully with federal regulations as required. This method will be used to determine refunds/ repayments for Title IV aid as well as state and institutional aid. This includes students who do not follow the university's policy for official withdrawal. For more information on CPHS withdrawals, see the Withdrawal section in the CPHS Academic Bulletin. To withdraw officially from the University during a semester, a student is required to complete an official Withdrawal Form, which can be acquired from the Office of Admissions & Student Affairs. The Withdrawal Form must be completed with proper signatures obtained, and turned into the Registrar's Office for placement in the student's permanent file. Failure to withdraw properly will result in a non- prorated reassessment of charges to the student account. Upon completion of the Withdrawal Form, the Registrar's Office updates class regis - tration as a withdrawal from the University denoting the Withdrawal Effective Date provided on the form. The Business Office verifies all classes have been updated accordingly and reassesses student tuition and fee charges. Housing and meal plan assignments are reviewed to ensure their correct reassessment. Drop Period: Days 1-5 of the drop period: 100% tuition refund Day 6 - until the last day of drop period: No tuition refund Financial Aid Disbursed to Student Account: Financial aid will disburse to student account the first day of class. Financial Aid Refund: Financial aid refunds will be refunded on or after day 6 of the drop period. If day 6 is a weekend or holiday, the Business Office will refund the next banking/business day. Contingent on banking regulation and individual banking processes, student will receive refunds in their bank account within 3 business days from the date of refund. The Business Office is responsible for the reassessment of student account charges; however, it is the responsibility of the Financial Aid Office to ensure financial aid awards have been evaluated and reas - sessed accordingly. The Business Office reserves the right to hold refund of credit balances until the Financial Aid Office has evaluated and approved the release of funds awarded to students who withdraw from the University.

Social m edia Policy Campbell University's College of Pharmacy & Health Sciences (CPHS) recognizes that online blogs, email lists and social network sites may include (but are not limited to) Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Snapchat, Pinterest, LinkedIn (hereafter collectively referred to as social media) and are increas - ingly popular tools for communication and social interaction. CPHS does not actively monitor online activities of the student body; however, it does address issues related to unprofessional behavior brought to the attention of the Office of Student Affairs. A CPHS student must understand that by identifying oneself publicly through social media, he/she is creating perceptions about CPHS, clinical/experiential sites, and/or his/ her chosen health profession; therefore, students must assure that all social media content is consistent with the values and professional standards of Campbell University, CPHS, and their profession. Indi - viduals should make every effort to present themselves in a mature, responsible, and professional manner. Discourse should be civil and respectful while taking care to avoid displays of vulgar, disrespectful, unflattering, or inflammatory language or photographs that reflect poorly on the student, program, or college. Please be aware that no privatization measure is perfect and that undesig - nated persons may still gain access to your networking site. Any and all future employers may review these network sites when considering potential candidates for employment. Although posted information can be removed from the original social networking site, exported information cannot be recovered. Any digital exposure can \"live on\" beyond its removal from the original website and continue to circulate in other venues; consequently, one should think carefully before posting any informa - tion on a website or application. Unprofessional behavior towards patients, other healthcare professionals, preceptors, faculty, staff, peers, or the public is a significant consideration in the evaluation and academic promotion of CPHS students. Students who use social media must be aware that posting certain information is GeNeRAl iNFOR mAtiON | 13proprietary and illegal. Violations of existing statutes and administrative regulations may result in criminal and civil liability including fines and imprisonment. Offenders may also be subject to adverse academic actions up to and including dismissal as outlined and detailed in the Academic Bulletin (Honor Code: Articles 2.5, Non-Academic Matters). Any conduct which evidences a lack of knowledge or ability to apply professional principles or skills, constitutes unprofes - sional conduct in violation of professional standards (Honor Code: Article 9 Student Clinical Code of Conduct). Prohibited actions that will be interpreted as unprofessional conduct and in violation of the CPHS Professional Behavior Stand - ards as described in the Academic Bulletin and may also constitute a violation of the University's academic and non- academic misconduct codes include, but are not limited to the following: You may not share the personal health information of other individuals. Removal of an individual's name does not alone constitute proper de-identifi - cation of protected health information. Inclusion of data such as age, gender, race, diagnosis, date of evaluation, the type of treatment or the use of a highly specific medical photograph (such as a before/after photograph of a patient having surgery or a photograph of a patient from a medical outreach trip) may still allow the reader to recognize the identity of a specific individual. You may not report private (protected) academic information of another stu - dent or trainee. Such information might include, but is not limited to: course grades, narrative evaluations, examina - tion scores, or adverse academic actions. You may not represent yourself as an official representative or spokesperson for Campbell University or the College of Pharmacy & Health Sciences. You may not represent yourself as another person, real or fictitious, or oth - erwise attempt to obscure your identity as a means to circumvent any prohibi - tions listed in the Academic Bulletin. You may not knowingly distribute false evidence, statements, or charges against another student or faculty/ staff member. You may not distribute negative com - ments against another student, faculty/ staff member, preceptor, or affiliated training site. You may not contribute to or engage in any activity which disrupts or obstructs the teaching, research or extension programs of CPHS or Campbell Universi - ty, either on the campus or at affiliated training sites. You may not threaten or engage in acts of physical violence to CPHS administra - tion, faculty, staff, or students. You may not harass, in any form, CPHS administration, faculty, staff, or students. You may not violate the confidentiality of a CPHS committee. Retaliation in any form is prohibited. You may not utilize websites and/or applications in a manner that interferes with your work commitments. You may not present any photograph(s) that may reasonably be interpreted as condoning the irresponsible use of alcohol, substance abuse, or sexual promiscuity. In addition to the examples of the absolute prohibitions outlined above, the following actions (and similar) are strongly discour - aged as these are considered unprofes - sional and reflect poorly on the individual, the healthcare profession, the College of Pharmacy & Health Sciences and Campbell University. Displays of vulgar language. Displays of language or photographs that imply disrespect for any individual or group because of age, race, gender, ethnicity, or sexual orientation. Posting of potentially inflammatory or unflattering material on another individual's website The following actions are considered best practices and are strongly encouraged: Bringing content that could harm a pa - tient's privacy, rights, or welfare to the attention of the appropriate authorities. Notifying CPHS faculty or staff of any violation of noted absolute prohibitions and unprofessional behavior that could negatively impact CPHS. Using privacy settings to limit unknown or unwanted access to your profile or application. Regularly checking your privacy settings to optimize privacy and security. Minimizing personal information on all social media profiles. Excluding address - es, phone numbers, social security num - bers, PID numbers, passport numbers, driver's license numbers, birth dates, or any other information that could be used to obtain personal records. Using a personal email address (not a campbell.edu address) as the primary means of identification, if choosing to list an email address on a social networking site. Discourse should always be civil and respectful. Presenting yourself in a mature, respon - sible, and professional manner. Violations of the CPHS Social Media Policy are subject to referral to the CPHS Student Affairs Office and/or the CPHS Student Conduct & Professionalism Committee. This policy was adapted and modified from The University of Louisiana at Monroe, College of Pharmacy, Social Media Policy, Student Handbook, 2013-2014; from The University of Florida's College of Pharmacy Social Media Policy, 2017; and from the National Student Nurses' Association, Inc. Recommendations for Social Media Usage and Maintaining Privacy, Confidentiality and Professionalism. Student Health Students may utilize the Student Health Center for preventive services and personal health concerns. For patient privacy and confidentiality, students must not be treat - ed by CPHS faculty in the student's program who may occasionally cover the clinic. The students should identify themselves as a CPHS student when checking into the clinic so that they may be scheduled with an appropriate provider. More information about health services offered is available at https:// www.campbell.edu/healt h-center/ . Student Services CPHS Office of Admissions & Student Affairs offers various student services and student involvement opportunities available to all graduate and professional CPHS students. Services and involvement including student organization participation, community service opportunities, academic support consultations, career services, and peer tu - toring services. One-on-one appointments and group workshops are available for both academic support needs (time management, study skills, test-taking, stress management, etc.) and career services needs (job searching, resume review, cover letter review, etc.). Peer tutoring services are available in each CPHS program to graduate and professional students. Students may request a tutor throughout the semester and sign up based upon their schedule. Any questions regarding graduate and professional student services should be directed to the CPHS Student Affairs team in the main office at (910) 893-1690.14 | 2022-2023 A CAdemi C BUlletiNtechnology d evices (Computers/ tablets) Technology devices are provided to students at orientation prior to the first year of, and for use in, their respective professional program. In accepting this program-issued device, the student agrees to the following: The student will maintain the device in good working condition throughout the entirety of the respective CPHS program. The student will do due diligence to protect the device against instances of loss, theft, and/or damage. The student will uphold the terms and conditions of the required software. The student agrees not to use the device and any software for commercial purposes. The student ultimately agrees to follow all University rules and policies which govern computer usage. Technology devices distributed to the students by the program are considered program property until graduation from the College of Pharmacy & Health Sciences (CPHS). In the event a student leaves the program prior to graduation, program- issued devices along with any additional issued equipment, are to be returned prior to exit from the University. Technology devices distributed by the program are to be used for program-related needs (in-class lectures, out-of-class assignments, clinical rotations, etc.) and required software platforms (Blackboard, ExamSoft, etc.). CPHS is aware social network sites are in high demand for active communication and social interaction. These sites can con - tain viruses so make sure to protect devices, as instructed by Campbell University IT Services. In General: Students are responsible for any and all actions stemming from their activities on the program-issued device. Students are responsible for needed maintenance and updates of the hard - ware and software on their program-is - sued device. Students should maintain updated virus protection. Students are to contact Campbell University IT Services Helpdesk (x1208) (helpdesk@campbell.edu ), with any program-issued device needs and/or concerns (i.e. software issues, hardware issues, broken parts, etc.). Program-issued devices are not the sole property of the student until the student has graduated CPHS. Therefore, devices are not to be given away or sold until they are no longer considered the property of CPHS. Violation of this agreement/policy is considered to be a professionalism issue and may result in referral to the student conduct and professionalism committee for possible probation or dismissal. Campbell University will carry a warranty on the program-issued technology device. This warranty coverage may vary from year- to-year, as well as the provisions included within it. Detailed information regarding warranties will be provided, along with the issue of technology devices, at first year orientation. Students should consult the Campbell University IT Services Helpdesk for ALL warranty issues. However, in the event the technology device is lost, stolen, or damaged beyond repair, the student will be responsible for repairing the device or replacing it with a similar product, in order to meet the in-class and testing needs of the program. As well, batteries are consid - ered consumables and may not be covered under warranty. tuition & Fees The university sets tuition and fees annually. This information is communicated through the university bursar's webpage (https://www.campbell.edu/ bursars-office/ tuition-fees/ ) and via email to current students. Tuition and fees for the upcoming academic year are estimated and are subject to change. Any new tuition and fees will become effective at the beginning of the academic year for the program. Tuition payment will be due the first week of class - es. Graduating students are responsible for the purchase of their regalia. To become and remain eligible for enroll - ment, health science students must meet the screening requirements to be cleared for their experiential education offered at affiliated training sites. These requirements include verifications and screens provided by third-party vendors, who set the prices for their services. Students must remain current with all required immunizations, criminal background check screens, and substance abuse screening tests for the duration of the program of study and are responsible for the associated costs. Students are required to possess and maintain health insurance throughout their respective program. International students are required to purchase health insurance program offered by the university. Relevant information related to these processes is communicated on the CPHS website, through email and during orientation. Applicants to the health science programs are responsible for fees associated with the admissions and matriculation process. Application/supplemental application fees, international transcript verification fees, standardized testing fees, criminal background checks fees, substance abuse screening fees, fees for required immuniza - tions are fees that are the responsibility of the applicant. Campbell University College of Pharmacy & Health Sciences (CPHS) utilizes policies, procedures, processes and systems that protect the privacy of all student information (i.e. personal, financial, educational, etc.). All students must have a social security number prior to matricula - tion and there is no fee associated with the process. Withdrawal & t emporary Separation Withdrawal and/or temporary separation from the College of Pharmacy & Health Sciences should only be considered after a careful and thorough evaluation of the academic, financial, and personal impacts arising from such an action. Prior to requesting an official withdrawal from the University during a semester, a student should discuss options with their academic advisor and/or program director. To officially withdraw from the College of Pharmacy & Health Sciences during a se - mester, a student must complete the CPHS Withdrawal Form (available on the CPHS Withdrawal website: https://cphs.campbell. edu/student-experience/graduate-stu - dent-affairs /withdrawal-information/ ). The Director of Student Affairs will process the withdrawal and a copy of the appro - priate documentation will be placed in the student's permanent file with appropriate administrative offices/ personnel notified. This form, once completed, will be distrib - uted to the following offices: Registrar, Financial Aid, Bursar, Accounting, Veteran's Affairs, and International Admissions so that a student's record may be closed out in all these areas. Upon completion of the CPHS Withdrawal Form, the Bursar's Office updates class registration as a withdrawal from the Uni - versity denoting the Withdrawal Effective Date provided on the form. The Business Office verifies all classes have been updated accordingly and reassesses student tuition and fee charges. Failure to withdraw properly will result in full charges and failing grades. Students will be responsible for all grants, scholarships, loans, and federal monies applied toward their tuition and general fees. Students receiving veterans' benefits must report GeNeRAl iNFOR mAtiON | 15to the Director of Veterans Affairs within thirty days of withdrawing from Campbell University. All graduate and professional programs at CPHS will have program-specific published dates for a deadline to withdrawal from school published in the academic calendar. Withdrawal from CPHS prior to or on the designated withdrawal date will result in a student receiving grades of W for all classes. Withdrawal after the designated withdraw- al date will result in a grade determined by the materials completed, usually resulting in a grade of F. Temporary Separation A temporary separation from the university is first initiated through the CPHS With - drawal form at the end of a semester when grades are finalized and the student is not enrolled in classes . If a student decides to take a temporary separation, the student will complete the form and indicate a date of return to a program. Any student taking a temporary separation will need to consider the timeline requirement for their degree; therefore, they must return to complete the degree within the required timeframe. Students should refer to the \"matriculation\" section of their respective program. If the temporary separation does not allow for this, the students must reapply to the program. Medical Withdrawal When a student withdraws at any time in cases of documented medical emergencies, even after the published last date to with - draw, the grade will be entered as a W. Any student requesting a Medical Withdrawal will be required to provide documentation from a medical professional (in addition to the official CPHS Withdrawal Form), and will be withdrawn from all cours - es and assigned a grade of W. Please note: in order to be eligible for re-instatement and enrollment after a medical withdrawal was granted, a student must provide doc - umentation from a medical provider that he/she is medically cleared to return to the academic rigors of the graduate/ profes - sional program. Additionally, the appropri - ate committee must evaluate any student, who was on probation or suspension due to performance at the time of withdrawal (i.e. academic probation or suspension is evaluated by the APSC). These evaluations are intended to provide a framework to assist the individual for a successful return to the program of study. Involuntary Withdrawal A student will be subject to involuntary withdrawal from the University if it is determined that the student is:1. Engaging or threatening to engage in be - havior which poses a danger of causing physical harm to him/herself or others. 2. Engaging or threatening to engage in behavior which would cause significant property damage or impede the lawful activities of others. 3. Engaging or threatening to engage in behavior that would damage the reputation of the University or when the reputation of its members is at stake. Complete information can be found in the Campbell University Student Handbook. Return from Withdrawal Students intending to return from a withdrawal or temporary separation must complete the Return from Withdrawal form, located on the website: https:// cphs.campbell.edu/student- experience/ graduate-student-affairs/withdrawal-infor - mation/ . The request will be reviewed by the CPHS Student Affairs office. Campbell University Behavioral Intervention Team (CUBIT) To ensure the safety and continued success of our student body, the Campbell Univer - sity Behavioral Intervention Team (CUBIT), serves the students by working with them and faculty to address and/or remediate any concerning event or pattern of personal behavior and/or professional interaction that implies a student is a threat to them - selves or others. For additional information, please refer to the Campbell University Student Handbook. Honor Code We, the students, staff and faculty of Campbell University's College of Pharmacy & Health Sciences (CPHS), recognize that healthcare related professions are among the most noble and honorable callings to which one may aspire. These are professions that demand of their members the highest degree of profes - sional competence, ethical behavior, and morality. They require continuous edu - cational development, constant personal and professional self-examination, and an ever-present awareness and sensitivity to human problems. It is the responsibility of every healthcare related professional, from the day that his or her professional career begins, to seek to achieve the highest aspi - rations and goals inherent in the profession; to exhibit honor and integrity in the use of his or her special skills for the betterment of humankind; and to act at all times in a manner which will instill public confidence in the profession. We therefore adopt this Honor Code in an attempt to set forth the minimum standards by which our conduct should be governed. Article 1: Academic m atters A. General Statement Recognizing that it is impossible and inadvisable to set forth with specificity a range of conduct that is prohibited, we nevertheless realize that questions arise occasionally with respect to what a student may or may not do in connection with an academic matter. This Honor Code therefore sets forth the minimum standards of conduct with the hope and expectation that a CPHS student will never approach, and certainly never fall below, these minimum standards. It is the obligation of the students and faculty to participate in making the honor system viable by reporting violations of all academic matters. B. Definition An academic matter means any one of the following: any activity which may affect a grade in a course; any activity which in any way contributes to satisfaction of the requirements of a course, or requirements for graduation, or co-curricular activities of an academic nature including student publication and competitions. C. Prohibited Activities with Respect to Academic Matters CPHS students shall not: 1. Use materials during an examina - tion other than those specifically authorized by the instructor. To avoid even the appearance of impropriety during an examination, all books, notebooks, briefcases, and the like should be placed in the front or rear of the examination room. 2. Use of materials in any research or assignment that are specifically forbidden by the instructor. This prohibited activity includes reuse of the student's own work. 3. Engage in any form of plagiarism. Plagiarism is using the words or ideas of another source directly without proper acknowledgment of that source. While it is often necessary to obtain information from other sources, the willful or inadvertent use of information from another source without acknowledging it (including all types of commercial term paper preparation services; internet or electronic database sources for term papers, journal clubs, or case 16 | 2022-2023 A CAdemi C BUlletiNpresentations; and other students' or professors' work) is considered pla - giarism. Ignorance is not an excuse. The student bears the responsibility to learn from the individual instructor the procedure for acknowledging sources and indicating quotations as required for each assignment. 4. Give, solicit, or receive information or assistance to or from any person or source during an examination, make - up examination, or written assign - ment unless specifically authorized to do so by the instructor. 5. Submit modified or changed tests, answer sheets, or assignments for regrading. 6. Intentionally deface, remove without authorization, or conceal any material from CPHS, the Drug Information Center, or any library. 7. Make an unauthorized or improper use of a computer or computer program, including unauthorized use of programmable calculators during an examination. 8. Fail to report to the Student Conduct and Professionalism Committee any firsthand knowledge of any viola - tion to any of the aforementioned provisions of this Honor Code. 9. Willfully conceal or misrepresent information material to an investiga - tion of any alleged violation of this Honor Code when the information is sought by the Student Conduct and Professionalism Committee, faculty, dean, or the dean's designee. Article 2: Non-academic matters A. General Statement CPHS students are hereby informed that in their personal and professional lives they represent not only themselves, but also CPHS and the health profession. Therefore, while they have the right and freedom to exercise individual autonomy, they also have the responsibility to exercise that autonomy in a manner that will bring honor to themselves, CPHS, and their chosen profession. B. Prohibited Activities with Respect to Nonacademic Matters CPHS students are subject to the same level of conduct as all Campbell University students; students residing in university housing are subject to the rules for all students who reside in university housing. Any infractions of these rules will be handled by the Student Conduct and Professionalism Committee. All students are encouraged to study the sections concerning these violations in the current Campbell University Student Handbook. In addition, CPHS student shall not: 1. Fail to conform his or her conduct to the ethical and moral standards of the healthcare profession as articu - lated in the Student Clinical Code of Conduct (Article 9). 2. Intentionally make misrepresentation on a resume or curriculum vitae concerning class rank, grades, academic honors, work experience, or any other matter relevant to job placement. 3. Purposely furnish false information. 4. Perpetrate any form of theft, forgery, falsification, or fraudulent use of university or work-site property. 5. Willfully conceal or misrepresent information material to an investi - gation of an alleged violation of this Honor Code when the information is sought by the Student Conduct and Professionalism Committee, faculty, dean, or the dean's designee. 6. Use or remove unauthorized pre - scription or nonprescription drugs or appliances from the site of a clinical rotation or work-site. Article 3: Violations: Civil l aw CPHS shall direct all cases concerning violations of civil laws to the Student Conduct and Professionalism Committee. Any violations will be handled by the Student Conduct and Professionalism Committee as described in the University handbook. All students are encouraged to study the section concerning these viola - tions in the Campbell University Student Handbook. Article 4: Penalties The associate dean of admissions & student affairs at CPHS may impose the following penalties for any of the violations listed above. Recommendations to the associate dean of admissions & student affairs are submitted by the Student Conduct and Professionalism Committee. Following proper procedures listed in article 5 of this Honor Code, the Student Conduct and Pro - fessionalism Committee may recommend to the associate dean of admissions & student affairs for one or more of the following penalties: 1. Separation: Separation is a state in which the student is not permitted to continue his/her program at the uni - versity. The student shall be withdrawn from all uncompleted courses in which he/she is currently enrolled. The student will not be permitted to re-enter the College of Pharmacy & Health Sciences' educational programs. 2. Suspension: Suspension is a tempo - rary state of separation for a definite period from the university including the programs, facilities and activities. The completion of the period of suspension does not guarantee reinstatement. The decision to readmit a student will be the responsibility of the associate dean of admissions & student affairs. 3. Probation: Probation can be of two types: Level-one probation Level-one probation for a stated period carries a loss of eligibility for: Holding or running for elected office in student professional organizations; Representing the University in any capacity both on campus and away from campus; Competing for honors and distinctions; Active participation as an elected rep - resentative or member of an honorary organization; Obtaining reimbursement monies from any funders within the College of Pharmacy & Health Sciences. Violation of the terms of level-one pro - bation may result in extended probation, level-two probation, or in the student's suspension. Level-two probation Level-two probation for a stated period car - ries a loss of eligibility for attendance at any and all CPHS sponsored activities. A student who is placed on level-two probation will automatically be placed on level-one pro - bation. Violation of the terms of level-two probation may result in extended probation or in the student's suspension. The terms of probation will be enforced by the Student Conduct and Professionalism Committee. Other persons may be appoint - ed by the associate dean of admissions & student affairs or the Student Conduct and Professionalism Committee to help enforce said terms. 1. Community Service: Community service for a stated number of hours will require a student to perform tasks that will benefit the community or CPHS. Tasks will be assigned and administered by the director of admissions & student affairs. GeNeRAl iNFOR mAtiON | 17Failure to perform required service in an appropriate fashion may result in probation. 2. Loss or Lowering of the Course Grade: All students who are found guilty of the act of cheating or plagiarism shall re - ceive a score of zero (0) on that specific component of the course (quizzes, tests, projects, assignments). Specific penalties for these violations may also include, but are not limited to, course failure, pro - bation, suspension, and/or separation from the program and the University. A second act of cheating or plagiarism by the student will result in the separation of the student from the University. 3. Reprimand: An official reprimand will be given by the Student Conduct and Professionalism Committee when the charges are not dismissed. A summary of the offense and the reprimand will be placed in the students file in the dean's office. Any professor may define penalties for a student who violates particular course regu - lations. The professor must clearly state these regulations and penalties in his or her course syllabus. The student has the right to appeal such penalties to the Student Conduct and Professionalism Committee. See Article 5, Section C - 1. Article 5: Student Conduct & Professionalism Committee A. General Statement The associate dean of admissions & student affairs is responsible for the administration of the CPHS disciplinary system. This responsibility is exercised on behalf of the president of the University and entails the supervision of several bodies. Alleged violations of the University's student code of conduct or civil laws will be handled by the University policies as written in the Campbell University Student Handbook. Alleged violations of the CPHS Honor Code will be evaluated by the Student Conduct and Professionalism Committee. B. Organization The Student Conduct and Professionalism Committee is composed of faculty members from each department, students and the director of student affairs (ex-officio). An ad-hoc member will be chosen to replace any member who cannot or chooses not to attend the proceedings. The associate dean of admissions & student affairs will appoint this member. This committee serves as a hearing board for incidents of misconduct involving violations of the Honor Code. The Honor Code includes standards for academic, non-academic, and clinical behavior. The Student Conduct and Professionalism Committee will make recommendations to the associate dean of admissions & student affairs. The associate dean of admissions & student affairs will then notify the student in writing of actions concerning alleged violations. A record of disciplinary actions is normally maintained by the dean's office until the student graduates or leaves CPHS. Students may examine the contents of their file by appointment with the director of admissions & student affairs. C. Instigation of Hearings When there is a suspicion of academic misconduct, investigation and appropriate actions may be pursued by either the professor of the course in which the alleged misconduct occurred or by the Student Conduct and Professionalism Committee. In either case, the matter must be promptly resolved. If the professor decides to deal with the incident, he or she should report the student's actions to the chair of the Student Conduct and Professionalism Committee. Individual faculty policies concerning misconduct should be clearly stated in the course syllabus. The accused student has the right to appeal any action by the faculty member to the Student Conduct and Pro - fessionalism Committee, in which normal committee procedures will be followed. Charges of misconduct may arise from a student (or group of students), professor, adjunct professor or preceptor. Within seven (7) days of the alleged misconduct or discovery of alleged misconduct, the accuser(s) should discuss the situation with either the director of student affairs or the professor in charge of the course. Dated notes should be taken to describe the discussion. Every effort should be made to maintain confidentiality in these discussions. If the accuser(s) has (have) opted to bring the matter before the director of admis - sions & student affairs, the director should meet with the professor and the chairper - son of the Student Conduct and Profession - alism Committee to explore options. This meeting should take place no longer than seven (7) days after the matter was brought to the attention of the director. The options available for resolution of the situation include: 1. If a faculty member assigns a student an F or a grade of zero on any assignment or test for which the reason was academic dishonesty, the faculty member must immediately notify the Associate Dean for Admissions and Student Affairs and the Student Conduct and Professional - ism Committee chairperson (SCPC) in writing of this event. The student does have the right to appeal the faculty's decision. If the SCPC and Associate Dean for Admissions and Student Affairs uphold the faculty's decision OR if the student chooses not to appeal, the record of the offense will remain in the student's file until graduation. If a second violation of the CPHS Honor Code occurs before graduation that is upheld by SCPC or not appealed, the student will automatically be referred to the SCPC for separate, additional sanctions including possible dismissal from the program. If the faculty member involved in the event currently serves on the SCPC, then the faculty member should recuse himself/herself from the committee meeting. 2. The case can be referred to the Student Conduct and Professionalism Committee for resolution. Referral to the committee must be by a written memo which names the student, describes the alleged misconduct (including pertinent dates and times), and summarizes the content of earlier meetings regarding this case. 3. The case may be dismissed. Within five (5) days of referral of the case to the Student Conduct and Professionalism Committee, the chair of the committee will provide a copy of the referral memo to the accused student(s). In addition, the chairperson will schedule an initial hearing for any charged student with the commit - tee. This hearing should be held within ten (10) days of the referral of the case to the committee. D. Proceedings The chair will begin preliminary investiga - tion of the allegations. Whenever possible, this should include a personal interview with the student, witnesses, and professor involved. Preliminary findings shall be presented at the initial meeting with the Student Conduct and Professionalism Committee. The chair shall objectively present his or her findings to the committee. The accused student(s) shall meet with the committee and be informed of the allegations and afforded an opportunity to defend him or herself. Although the purpose of this hearing is exploratory and fact finding in nature, the accused student does have the right to solicit advice and to offer witnesses to support his or her position. The committee shall vote on whether or not preliminary findings warrant a full hearing 18 | 2022-2023 A CAdemi C BUlletiNby a simple majority vote. If a hearing is deemed necessary, the chair will notify the student and witnesses of the hearing date in writing at least three (3) days prior to the hearing. A waiver of his or her notice may be made if the student so chooses. A full hearing should be held within ten (10) days of the preliminary committee review. If the committee votes that no hearing is warranted, the case will be dismissed. The chair will file the minutes in the permanent files of the Student Conduct and Professionalism Committee and a copy shall be placed in the dean's office until the student graduates or leaves CPHS. Should additional information become available, the chairperson may reopen the case and ask the committee to consider the new information. All sessions of the committee will be closed to all individuals except those immediately concerned in the case, except by the expressed wish of the accused that the hearings be open. No attorney shall be present, as this setting is not a court of law. In the case of a closed hearing, all persons present at the proceedings shall be bound to disclose no more than the committee does in its official report on the case. Revelation of such details will be considered a violation of the Honor Code. In the case of closed hearings, the testi - mony of each witness shall be given while the other witnesses in the case are out of the room. In open hearings, the witnesses of both parties shall be present during the entire proceedings. The committee may allow introduction of evidence other than testimony of witnesses provided that the evidence is relevant to the question before the committee on any matter. The committee shall set rules for the conduct of all cases and all arrangements connected with the taking of evidence. Time frames for instigation of hearings and proceedings may be altered if circumstanc - es warrant. Votes on all matters shall be a simple majority. Deliberation of the committee shall take place in private and remain secret. Voting on decisions of guilt shall be by secret ballot. If the committee determines that the student was in violation of the Honor Code, it will consider and recom - mend the appropriate penalty. The student should be informed immediately of the judgment and the recommended penalty in case of guilt. The associate dean of admis - sions & student affairs may uphold or reject any decision or penalty recommended by the committee.

Article 9: Student Clinical Code of Conduct CPHS students and faculty have adopted the following code of conduct to guide ethical behavior in hospitals, community pharmacies, research and production facilities, and various rotation sites included as clinical practice experiences. We feel that the magnitude of our responsibility as healthcare professionals necessitates the establishment of the highest standards of professional conduct. This code of conduct represents general standards of behavior and illustrates ideals for which to strive; however, specific infrac - tions reported by students, preceptors or faculty to the chair of the Student Conduct and Professionalism Committee may be investigated by this committee with respect to both the magnitude and chronicity of incidents considered. It should also be understood that these general standards may not afford guidance in every conceiv - able situation or anticipate every possible infraction. The Student Conduct and Professionalism Committee will be charged with the responsibility of promptly investigating alleged infractions of this code. All cases will require the submission of a report of findings and appropriate recommendations to the associate dean for admissions & student affairs in a timely manner. Students should read, discuss and sign the Honor Code prior to enrollment to CPHS. This code of conduct was created by the students and faculty of CPHS. Modifications of this code will require majority approval of both the faculty and student body. The students attending CPHS will:GeNeRAl iNFOR mAtiON | 19Respect and Concern for the Welfare of Patients Treat patients and their families with re - spect and dignity both in their presence and in discussions with others. Recognize when one's ability to function effectively is compromised and ask for relief or help. Recognize the limits of student involve - ment in the medical care of a patient and seek supervision or advice before acting when necessary. Not use alcohol or other drugs in a man - ner that could compromise themselves or patient care. Respect for the Rights of Others Deal with professional, staff and peer members of the healthcare team in a considerate manner and with a spirit of cooperation. Act with an egalitarian spirit toward all persons encountered in a professional capacity regardless of race, religion, gender, sexual preference or socioeco - nomic status. Respect the patient's modesty and privacy. Trustworthiness Be truthful in communication to others. Maintain confidentiality of patient information. Admit errors and not knowingly mislead others to promote one's self at the expense of the patient. Not represent himself or herself as a pharmacist, physician, physician assis - tant, or other health professional. Accurately acknowledge the sources for all information reported. Failure to do so will be considered plagiarism. Responsibility and Sense of Duty Participate responsibly in patient care or research to the best of his or her ability and with the appropriate supervision. Undertake clinical duties and persevere until they are complete. Notify the responsible person if some - thing interferes with his or her ability to perform clinical or academic tasks effectively. Professional Demeanor Maintain a neat and clean appearance, and dress in attire that is accepted as professional to the population served. Be thoughtful and professional when interacting with patients and families. Strive to maintain composure during times of fatigue, professional stress, or personal problems. Avoid offensive language, gestures, or inappropriate remarks. Adhere to the CPHS professional dress code. Student Rights In addition to the standards we have adopt - ed for the conduct of ourselves, we expect to be treated with respect as participants in the delivery of healthcare. CPHS students: Should be challenged to learn, but should not be belittled, humiliated or abused in front of patients, peers or other health professionals. Should not be sexually harassed, either verbally or physically. Should not be discriminated against on the basis of gender, race, religion or sexual preference. Should be a participant in patient care decisions whenever possible. Should have his or her healthcare related education take priority over routine menial tasks. If a preceptor feels a student lacks ade - quate knowledge or skills, he or she has the responsibility to inform and instruct that student so he or she can improve his or her performance. If a student feels that a preceptor has committed infractions against the above standards, he or she has the responsibility of informing that preceptor, whether by direct contact or by way of an honest preceptor evaluation at the end of a rotation, of such feelings so that the preceptor can improve his or her perfor - mance. NOTE: The above standards of conduct are based on the Code of Conduct for Duke University Medical Students and have been adapted to meet the individual needs of CPHS. Article 10: Pledge A student's signature indicates that he or she agree to uphold the following pledge. A separate pledge form with the language below will be provided and must be signed prior to entry into CPHS. I, having read and receiving a clear under - standing of the basis, spirit and interpre - tation of the CPHS Honor Code, pledge my personal honor. I will uphold this code and its standards in all matters. If at any time I violate the letter or the spirit of this pledge, I accept full responsibility for my actions. I, having read and reviewing the most current CPHS Academic Bulletin, agree to comply with all policies and procedures indicated in the bulletin and accept full responsibility in the event I do not comply.Administrative Departments Office of the Dean Michael L.

Smith Hall 4150 U.S. Hwy ipe@campbell.edu Mission & Vision Mission Statement The mission of the Campbell University Office of Interprofessional Education (CUIPE) is to develop healthcare profes - sionals as effective leaders and members of interprofessional healthcare teams through: clinically innovative didactic and experi - ential curriculum; collaboration aligning within education, research, and service; and application grounded in valued partner - ships within our community and healthcare systems. We seek to develop not only students, but also educators and clinicians who, together, catalyze the team-based care movement to transform the rural healthcare landscape for patients and populations. Through the development of all of these agents of change, CUIPE seeks to ultimately create an integrated continuum balancing curriculum and team-based care, advancing a superior healthcare model for all, one grounded in core principles of interprofes - sional collaborative practice, patient-cen - tered care, and evidence-based medicine. Vision CUIPE will be nationally-recognized as a pro - gram that molds a community of healthcare providers - students, faculty, and clinicians alike - who, through interprofessional collaborative practice, promote efforts to reduce cost of healthcare, to transform the patient experience, and to improve overall population health. Triple Aim To these ends, CUIPE centers its strategic plan around the IHI Triple Aim. The frame - work, designed in 2007 by the Institute for Healthcare Improvement, encourages insti - tutions to pursue the following dimensions: Improve the patient experience of care (including quality and satisfaction) Improving the health of populations Reducing the per capita cost of health - care IPEC Competencies CUIPE also develops programming grounded in the IPEC Core Competencies for Interprofessional Collaborative Practice. These competencies were created by the Interprofessional Education Collaborative (IPEC) and published in 2011 and updated in 2016. The goal of this collaborative was to promote and encourage the advancement of substantive interprofessional learning experiences. The resulting competencies are organized into four domain areas, which CUIPE uses as standards of interprofessional education: Values & Ethics, Roles/Respon - sibilities, Interprofessional Communication, and Teams and Teamwork. Curriculum & Programming Core interprofessional education (IPE) curriculum and programming is developed by the IPE office according to the mission statements of Campbell University, CPHS, and the IPE Office, along with the Triple Aim and the IPEC Core Competencies as stated above. Development involves a stringent process that has been designed to ensure quality IPE programming. This process extends to additional activities submitted by faculty members and students. When individuals or groups submit proposals for new IPE activities, the office uses a rigorous checklist to evaluate each proposal and ensure these additional activities are truly interprofessional in nature and quality experiences for participants. Annual Events & Activities First Year Event IPE REPS PLACES IPE QUEST Interprofessional Health Sciences Research Symposium Campbell Interprofessional Case Studies IPE Activity Day Please see chart below for details on program attendance requirements. Opportunities for Students & Faculty IPE Leadership Recognition Program Wallace Servant Leadership Fellows IPE Faculty Development Series IPE INFORM SWIPE Students interested in pursuing any of these opportunities should contact the IPE Office at ipe@campbell.edu. Academic Programs Programs that regularly participate in IPE programming include: Nursing (BSN) Osteopathic Medicine (DO) Pharmaceutical & Clinical Sciences (PCS) Pharmacy Practice (PharmD) Physical Therapy (DPT) Physician Assistant Practice (MPAP) Public Health (MSPH)Other Campbell University programs outside the health sciences may also participate depending on the activity. Event & Activity Descriptions First Year Event The IPE First Year Event is specifically geared toward first-year students. Stu - dents participate in an event designed to introduce them to concepts and goals of interprofessional collaboration. This event allows students from all programs, outside of their program \"silos,\" to discuss common healthcare issues or concepts. The goal of the event is for students to form collaborative relationships across program boundaries. IPE REPS IPE REPS is an innovative event that aims to improve student understanding about the roles and responsibilities of the members on the interprofessional collaborative healthcare team. REPS is named for its four components, Reflect, Engage, Practice, and Summarize ; these are designed to give students direct instruction on various professions and to give students the op - portunity to share knowledge and concepts during an interactive, interprofessional case that highlights the roles and responsibilities of each profession. PLACES PLACES is a conference-style event that focuses on professionalism, service, and skills. This event offers students invaluable opportunities for networking and profes - sional development. PLACES is a joint effort between the Office of Student Affairs and the Office of Interprofessional Education. IPE Activity Day IPE Activity Day is supported by the faculty and students of CPHS and CUSOM (Campbell University School of Osteopathic Medicine), who create, design, and facilitate activities based on their own backgrounds and expertise. Participants have the free - dom to select an activity to attend based on their own interests, and the result is a ver - itable smorgasbord of interactive sessions focusing on interprofessional concepts and competencies. Examples of sessions include Anthrax Attack; Cultural Competence in Healthcare Practice; Hypertension Cases; New Drug Development; and iOSCE. IPE QUEST IPE QUEST represents the culmination of all that students have learned from their other IPE events throughout the year. At IPE QUEST, students will enjoy Q uandaries 44 | 2022-2023 A CAdemi C BUlletiNof Unifying, Energizing, and S uperlative Teamwork exercises that require interpro - fessional teams to successfully complete physical obstacles and academic puzzles requiring the most effective teamwork and IPE competence. This event focuses on the competency domain of interprofessional communication. Interprofessional Health Sciences Research Symposium The annual Interprofessional Education Health Sciences Research Symposium showcases the research accomplishments of students, residents, and faculty. Typically, the symposium features an esteemed keynote speaker as well as poster awards in a number of categories. Students and faculty are encouraged to attend whether they are presenting research or not. CICS CICS, or Campbell Interprofessional Case Studies, are specifically designed to allow students to practice interprofessional com - munication, collaboration, and teamwork skills and strategies. In interprofessional groups, students interview a patient (an actor who serves as a standardized patient) and collaborate to identify a diagnosis and create a treatment plan. While diagnosis and treatment make up one of the goals of the case, the main focus is interprofessional collaborative practice. Students benefit not only from receiving feedback about their interviewing, diagnosing, and treatment planning skills, but they also are able to share skills and knowledge with one anoth - er. Most importantly, the team is able to witness the greater scope of treatment and care across the spectrum of professions. CICS cases are held periodically throughout the year. IPE Leadership Recognition Program The IPE Leadership Recognition program presents students the unique opportunity to earn recognition for demonstrating true commitment to the ideals of interprofes - sional collaboration. Students who pursue official recognition consistently go above and beyond the typical IPE requirements. These students not only actively engage in IPE programming; they participate in developing new programs and initiatives, take on leadership positions, and enthu - siastically promote IPE principles to their fellow classmates, faculty, college, and university. After graduation, these same students, and those they have encouraged, will enter communities as leaders in their profession who will advance the movement of interprofessional collaborative practice, prepared for an ever-changing healthcare landscape that depends more and more on the collaboration and teamwork of all mem - bers of the healthcare team and beyond. Wallace Servant Leadership Fellows The Wallace Servant Leadership Fellows is a program that began as part of the Gore Center for Servant Leadership in 2016. The program aims to \"inform and inspire the calling and commitment to Interprofes - sional Servant Leadership in Healthcare.\" Throughout the program, students participate in book readings & discussions, reflection papers, lectures, one-on-one mentoring appointments and periodic group meetings with Chancellor Wallace, and other opportunities. At the end of the year, an awards celebration is held to recognize the Wallace Fellows. IPE Faculty Development Series The IPE Faculty Development Series is an opportunity for faculty to become \"IPE-cer - tified.\" The series involves a series of lunch-and-learns and workshops developed to improve faculty understanding of IPE concepts and competencies, while giving faculty members practice in facilitating interprofessional small groups and teaching about interprofessional collaborative skills. IPE INFORM IPE INFORM stands for I nterprofessional Noontime F orums O nline: R enew Y our Mind. This represents the IPE Office's first series of continuing education programming consisting of twelve sessions designed for and by interprofessional audiences. The pro- gram was created specifically with Campbell University faculty, alumni, and preceptors in mind, as a component of the IPE Faculty Development Series. SWIPE SWIPE, or Student leadership With IPE, is a student organization devoted to inter - professional education. Students who join SWIPE are passionate about IPE and work - ing with students in other programs. SWIPE members work to provide feedback and ideas to the IPE Office while communicating about upcoming events and programming to fellow students. Members of SWIPE represent each of the on-campus health sciences programs in CPHS and CUSOM.

Academic Progression in the BSN Program Student Progression within the BSN pro - gram varies from the standard grade scale and progression and remediation effort for undergraduate students. This academic rigor is essential for the assumption that the Catherine W. Wood School of Nursing BSN graduate is a safe and effective care provider. Grading Scales - must be completed in the prescribed sequence and within 3 years of matriculation to the BSN Program. 2. A student must earn a grade of at least 2.0 (75) in each nursing course. 3. Rounding of Methods of Evaluation- the calculation of a grade will be based on rounding a score ranging from number + 0.5 below the number to + .49 above the number to the common whole number (Example: A grade of 75 = 74.5 through 75.49; 74 = 73.5 through 74.49). Rounding occurs only for end of course grades. 4. A student earning a grade of less than 2.0 must repeat the course. If a student earns less than 2.0 or in a second nursing course, the student is dismissed from the program and is ineligible for readmission. A nursing course can be repeated one time only. 5. The expectation is that the students meet each clinical objective/behavior with a satisfactory performance by the end of the course. 6. Unsatisfactory clinical performance constitutes a course failure. Failure in either the clinical or didactic portion of the course results in a failure and necessitates repeating the course. tuition and Fees Reference the General Information section in this bulletin for more details. There will be additional expenses upon entry to the BSN Degree Program. These may include but are not limited to the following: scrub uniform, credentialling services, transpor - tation to clinical, cost of NCLEX-RN testing, CPR certification, immunizations, books, supplies and graduation expenses.

Vehicular Requirements All students of the nursing program are required to provide his/her own transporta - tion to and from the University as well as to the clinical experience sites. Conduct The enrolled student is accountable for all aspects of the current Student Conduct (Professional, Academic and The Honor Code) as defined in the Undergraduate Aca - demic Bulletin and the General Information section of this academic bulletin for the Honor Code. Nursing students are required to read and sign the Honor Code, attesting that they understand the code that they have read and understand the bulletin, and will abide by it. A signed copy of the code will be kept in the students file.Academic Standards A Campbell University academic review convenes in May of each year to review the academic progress of undergraduate students. An \"Academic Warning\" is issued to any student who incurs a quality point deficit between 10 and 34.5 quality points. The student is referred to campus resources for resolution. The Catherine W. Wood School of Nursing has additional progression requirements and focused remediation efforts designed to protect the student and public in care delivery situations while assuring a greater opportunity for success. Please refer to Student Handbook for the Catherine W. Wood School of Nursing or the CPHS Academic Bulletin for details. Reports on academic performance and progress are generated at the mid-term and completion of each semester. The Catherine W. Wood School of Nursing faculty meets at the end of each academic term, or as necessary, to discuss the academic performance of all students. Any discussions regarding type of academic deficiency and remedy occurs with development of an Academic Success Plan and draft of a letter from the program director stating the specific academic stand - ing described in the following sections. The letter is provided to the student via email and hard copy by mail. The letter will contain the following: Description of academic standing (probation, suspension, dismissal) Rationale for academic standing Criteria required to regain good academ - ic standing Contact information of the program director to discuss items outlined in the letter Notification of appeals process Good Academic Standing Students are considered in good academic standing providing: A semester GPA 75 or 2.0 average cumulative grade point (GPA) based on the BSN grading criteria Satisfactory evaluation on the Clinical Evaluation Tool for clinical experiences No violations of student Honor Code or Code of Conduct have occurred No occurrence of a patient safety violation Remediation The CWWSON believes that remediation is a process that begins once a student has failed to achieve a passing score (< 75%) on an exam, assignment or clinical per -50 | 2022-2023 A CAdemi C BUlletiNformance (safety violations, NI, or U). The Clinical Instructor and/or Course Director will identify clinical performance issues that require remediation with specific sugges - tions for improvement. The student is to reach out to the Course Director or BSN Advisor to develop academic strategies that will result in positive outcomes. Strategies may focus on: study habits, test-taking techniques, test review, small group reme - diation or referrals to Counseling, Student Success or those listed on the course syllabi. Faculty may notify the student of low performance through Blackboard, CU Succeed or email. The student is responsi - ble for the follow through in order to assure academic progression. Should a student fail to improve academic and/or behavioral per - formance issues, they will receive a failing grade for the course. This will necessitate a delay in the graduation date. Students require remediation for: A grade of D or F in any single course Continuing Needs Improvement or Unsatisfactory ranking on the Clinical Evaluation Tool Violations of student Honor Code or Code of Conduct Any patient safety issue throughout the curriculum Academic Probation Academic probation is the initial action for a student failing to make satisfactory academic progress following remediation interventions. A student will be placed on academic probation for: Failure to follow through with the Academic Success Plan (remediation) Continuing Needs Improvement or Unsatisfactory ranking on the Clinical Evaluation Tool A grade of D or F in any single course Repeated violations of the student Honor Code or Code of Conduct Violations of patient safety A student placed on academic probation will remain so until the end of the semester. Students who fail to complete the criteria for lifting academic probation will be considered for suspension or dismissal from the BSN program. The BSN Academic Performance and Standards Committee and program director, with notification to the associate dean for health sciences, will recommend these actions. A recommenda - tion will be made to the program director to restore good academic standing if: A semester GPA 75 or 2.0 average cumulative grade point (GPA) based on the BSN grading criteria is achieved The CU Succeed Warnings/Academic Success Plan was followed with desired results achieved Satisfactory evaluation on the Clinical Evaluation Tool for clinical experiences No violations of student Honor Code or Code of Conduct have occurred No occurrence of a patient safety violation Academic Suspension Academic suspension from the Catherine W. Wood School of Nursing and CPHS is imposed for a specified period of time and must not exceed one year. Suspension occurs when a student has academic deficiencies which preclude continuation in a normal program of study, but may be expected to be able to complete the requirements for the degree under a modified program of study with or without remedial courses. A student on academic suspension is not allowed to continue the standard course of study. The Catherine W. Wood School of Nursing Academic Performance and Standards Committee and program director will specify the length of time of the suspension and remedial work required for reinstatement, with approval from the associate dean for health sciences. Academic d ismissal The Catherine W. Wood School of Nursing Academic Performance and Standards Committee and program director may recommend academic dismissal to the associate dean for health sciences under the following circumstances: Fails to make satisfactory progress during the period of probation and or suspension. A single egregious and/or knowing viola - tion of patient safety, confidentiality, or professionalism. A student earning a grade of less than a 75 or 2.0 average cumulative grade point (GPA) based on the BSN grading criteria, must repeat the course. If a student earns less than 2.0 in a second nursing course, student dismissal from the BSN Program occurs. This dismissal results in being ineligible for readmission. A repeat of a nursing course occurs one time only. Unsatisfactory clinical performance constitutes a course failure. If a student earns less than 2.0 in a second nursing course, student dismissal from the BSN Program occurs. This dismissal results in being ineligible for re - admission. A repeat of a nursing course occurs one time only.Grade Appeal Students can initiate an appeal of an assignment grade or final course grade by following the procedure as detailed in the current CPHS Academic Bulletin. delayed Graduation Policy If a nursing student is required to re-take classes as a result of specific course failure or a deficiency in overall academic performance, then a delay in scheduling nursing clinical experiences or matriculation through the curriculum will occur and the student's graduation is delayed. Volun - tary course withdrawals or a temporary separation may cause a delay in scheduling clinical experiences, progress through the curriculum, and a subsequent delay in graduation. Any alteration in the normal curriculum pro - gression may affect a student's financial aid status or qualification for education-based financial aid. For specific counseling and advice, students should contact the Univer - sity's Office of Financial Aid. Graduation Requirements Recommendation for graduation requires faculty approval and attainment of the following requirements: 1. Successful completion of all courses, requirements, and remediation 2. Successful completion of all clinical experiential training 3. Attendance of graduation week activities that includes licensure preparation courses and comprehensive curriculum review 4. Attendance at the graduation ceremony is expected the BSN d ivision Requirements for Graduation Completion of the nursing and general education courses prescribed by the faculty Completion of nursing courses with a minimum grade of 2.0 (75) in each course Attainment of a minimum 2.0 cumulative GPA (see grading scale variation) 25% of semester credit hours in resi - dence at Campbell University Attendance at the graduation ceremony is expected A faculty vote is required to approve students for graduation The Catherine W.

However, the responsi - bility for assuring that all requirements are met rests solely with the student. Registered Nurse Licensure Exam Requirements The North Carolina Board of Nursing (NC- BON) uses the National Council Licensure Examination (NCLEX\u00ae) prepared by National Council of State Boards of Nursing (NCSBN) to measure competence for entry-level practice for graduates of Board-approved nursing education programs. The National Council of State Boards of Nursing has contracted with Pearson VUE to administer NCLEX\u00ae.For more detailed information about the NCLEX, please visit the National Council of State Boards of Nursing's website. Eligibility requirements for examination: Completion of a member Board approved RN nursing education program Application for licensure to state Board of Nursing Registration with Pearson Vue is required prior to the release of an Authorization to Test (ATT) All applicants must complete a criminal background check prior to the issuance of a license The Board of Nursing determines if the student with a prior criminal conviction is allowed to sit for the NCLEX-RN exam. Please note that conferring a degree to a student who has completed the curriculum does not guarantee that the Board of Nursing will issue an Authorization to Test. Curriculum The Essentials of Baccalaureate Education for Professional Nursing Practice [American Association of Colleges of Nursing (AACN), 2008]; Nursing Scope and Standards of Practice (2015) provide the framework for the development of the liberal arts and pre-licensure nursing education curriculum and the associated clinical experiences. The Essentials address the core knowledge required of nursing professionals and concepts of patient centered care, interpro - fessional teams, evidence-based practice, quality improvement, patient safety, informatics, clinical reasoning, cultural sensitivity, professional values and practice across the life span. The practice experience in the final two years enhances the connection with didactic content and facilitates growth across the curriculum. The rationale for sequencing of courses facilitates moving from the simple to the complex. Students begin their nursing courses by learning to assess and plan care for meeting basic needs of the independent communi - ty-based adult followed by a nursing home resident at variable levels of required skill. Upon completion of the program, students are working as a team member to organize, implement, collaborate and evaluate nursing care for groups of patients/families, community groups and populations. The student evaluations demonstrate increasing expectations in clinical performance.52 | 2022-2023 A CAdemi C BUlletiNFreshman Year Semester 1 Courses Credit Hours ENGL 101 - Academic Writing 3 HIST 111 or 112 - Western Civilization I or II 3 BIOL 111 - Basic Biology 4 CPHS 100 - CPHS Pre-Professional Freshman Seminar 1 PE 185 - Lifetime Wellness 2 MATH 111 (or greater) 3 Total 16Semester 2 Courses Credit Hours CUC 100 - Connections 0.5 ENGL 102 - Academic Writing & Literature 3 PSYC 222 - General Psychology 3 BIOL 275 - Fundamental Microbiology 4 CHRS 125 - Intro to Christianity 3 A/M/T 131 - Intro to Art, Music, or Theater 3 Total 16.5 Sophomore Year Semester 1 Courses Credit Hours CUC 200 - Connections 0.5 SOCI 225 - Principles of Sociology 3 BIOL 285 - Human Anatomy & Physiology I 4 PSYC 260 - Developmental Psychology 3 ELECTIVE*(Humanities) 3 Total 13.5Semester 2 Courses Credit Hours ENGL 2XX - Literature 3 BIOL 286 - Human Anatomy & Physiology II 4 COMM 261 - Team & Small Group Communication [BML1] 3 MATH 160 - Statistics 3 ELECTIVES 3 Total 16 *It is strongly recommended that students take CHRS 224 - Christian Ethics.

The student's failure to submit the petition letter within three (3) business days is acknowledgement of dismissal. The petition must contain the specific variance requested; a description of any extenuating circumstances intended to justify granting the variance for consider - ation should the variance be granted. The Associate Dean's decision is final. MSPS Program Remediation Policy 1. The primary goal of remediation is to provide the underperforming student with a means to overcome deficiencies in achieving the competency in the required course material rather than to improve his/ her GPA. 2. Only students with an earned final course grade of F due to poor perfor - mance on a block examination or elec - tive course final exam will be eligible for remediation, and the highest grade that can be achieved after remediation would be a C. 3. Instructors should complete the reme - diation process as soon as practically possible, e.g., during Christmas break for Fall courses or during the month of May for Spring courses. In addition, instruc - tors must notify the Department Chair and the Chair of the Academic Perfor - mance & Standards (APS) Committee of any remediating student and provide an expected completion date. 4. Students may have a grade of IC entered until the remediation is complete and then a final grade can be entered. 5. Students have the option not to remediate and take the course when it is offered again, in which case their grade will not be limited to a C. Students who elect not to remediate must sign docu - mentation provided by the Department of Pharmaceutical & Clinical Sciences indicating that they were offered remediation.

Based on this evaluation, an invitation to participate in a personal admissions interview may be extended. The interview process incorporates a multiple mini interview (MMI) format. This interview style is composed of six stations and is designed to assess non-cognitive qualities, such as communication skills, critical thinking, ethical reasoning, and leadership. MMI interviews are moderated by faculty, alumni, staff, clinicians, and/or residents affiliated with CPHS. Applicants are notified by email of admissions decisions following the interview process. Early Acceptance Program An Early Acceptance Program is available for applicants who have a verified appli - cation by October 15. The college and the student have the potential to benefit from this program by confirming admissions and enrollment for qualified applicants early in the admissions process. The completed PharmCAS application along with two letters of recommendation are required.PHARMACY | 67Technical Standards for Admission & Matriculation The Accreditation Council on Pharmaceu - tical Education (ACPE), the accrediting body for colleges and schools of pharmacy, requires that Doctor of Pharmacy curricula meet standards and guidelines which em - phasize a strong scientific foundation and practice-based competency. The pharmacy curriculum is designed to develop caring and competent pharmacists, practitioners who assume responsibility for safe and effective medication use in patients. The pharmacy curriculum is also designed to produce pharmacists who are collaborative partners in the care of patients within an interdisciplinary health care system. Technical Standards refer to non-academic admissions and matriculation criteria that are essential to participation in the Doctor of Pharmacy program. All students must possess the intellectual, ethical, physical, and emotional capabilities required to successfully complete the full curriculum, including experiential education, and to achieve the levels of competence required by the faculty. The technical standards described below are essential functions and therefore prerequisites for entrance, continuation, promotion, and graduation from the Doctor of Pharmacy program, with or without appropriate accommodations in compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act. Candidates for admission to and graduation from the Campbell University College of Pharmacy & Health Sciences Doctor of Pharmacy Program must possess the following abilities: Observation The candidate/student-pharmacist must be able to observe required lectures, demonstrations and experiments, including but not limited to microscopic studies, phar - maceutical lab instruction (technical quality of prepared and compounded materials), and patient care demonstrations (physical observation and physical assessment). A candidate/ student-pharmacist must be able to observe a patient accurately at a distance and close at hand, noting non-verbal and verbal signals. Observation necessitates functional use of vision, hearing and somatic senses. The candidate/ student- pharmacist must be capable of remaining alert and attentive at all times in the clinical setting. Communication A candidate/student-pharmacist must be able to effectively speak, read and write in English. Visual and auditory senses must be intact to detect verbal and non-verbal communication signals. A candidate/ student-pharmacist must be able to elicit information from and communicate effectively and sensitively with patients. The candidate/ student-pharmacist must be able to communicate effectively and efficiently in oral and written form with all members of the health care team. Motor Abilities A candidate/student-pharmacist must have sufficient motor function to carry out the basic laboratory experiments and physical assessment. The candidate/student-phar - macist must be able to carry out duties within the classroom, laboratory, pharmacy and clinic settings. Motor function must be sufficient to perform fundamental patient care, such as required for disease preven - tion, drug therapy monitoring, emergency treatment, general care and basic physical assessment (e.g. blood pressure assessment, palpation for edema, injection of vaccines, cardiopulmonary resuscitation, etc.). Motor function must also be sufficient to perform drug distribution duties in both a communi - ty and hospital pharmacy setting. Candidates/student-pharmacists must have the ability to maintain aseptic technique in the preparation of sterile materials. This will require the ability to work under a laminar flow hood and in sterile rooms. Candidates must possess the motor function sufficient to direct and supervise the accurate com- pounding and preparation of medications for dispensing to patients. A candidate/ student pharmacist must be able to safely and effectively operate various types of laboratory and patient care equipment such as weights and balance, a glucose meter, stethoscope and sphygmomanometer. A candidate/student-pharmacist must be able to use computer-based information systems. These motor actions require co - ordination of both gross and fine muscular movements, equilibrium and functional use of the senses of touch, vision, and hearing. Additionally, some aspects of patient care require that the student-pharmacist be able to act quickly and speed of motor function may be an essential requirement. Intellectual, Conceptual, Integrative, and Quantitative Problem solving, the critical skill demanded of pharmacists, requires that a candidate/ student-pharmacist be able to learn, retrieve, analyze, sequence, organize, synthesize and integrate information effi - ciently, and reason effectively. In addition, a candidate/student-pharmacist should possess the ability to measure and calculate accurately, to perceive three-dimensional relationships and to understand the spatial relationships of structures. Behavioral and Social Attributes A candidate/student-pharmacist must pos - sess the emotional health required for full utilization of his/her intellectual abilities, the exercise of good judgment, the prompt completion of all responsibilities attendant to the diagnosis and care of patients, and the development of mature, sensitive and effective relationships with patients and their family members, staff, and colleagues. Each candidate/student-pharmacist must be able to work effectively as a member of a health-care team. Candidates/stu - dent-pharmacists must be able to tolerate physically taxing workloads and to function effectively under stress. The candidate/student-pharmacist must be able to adapt to changing environments, to display flexibility and to learn to function in the face of uncertainties inherent in the clinical problems of many patients. Compassion, integrity, concern for others, interpersonal skills, collegiality, interest, and motivation are all personal qualities that are assessed during the admission and education processes. Equal Access to the CPHS Doctor of Pharmacy Program In accordance with Campbell University's non-discrimination policy, the College of Pharmacy & Health Sciences does not discriminate against otherwise qualified individuals with disabilities who apply for admission to the Doctor of Pharmacy program. It is recognized that the on-site or virtual interview may not adequately evaluate a student's ability to meet the technical standards. Candidates who are unsure that they meet the Technical Standards because of a disability are responsible for disclosing that to the Campbell University Office of Student Success before accepting an offer of admission. The Director of Disability Services will consult with the candidate regarding possible accommodations. At the time an applicant accepts an offer to the CPHS Doctor of Pharmacy program, he/she must attest in writing that they are able to meet the CPHS Doctor of Pharmacy Program Technical Standards for Admission & Matriculation with or without accommo - dations. Students will continue to attest in writing during orientation through the fourth year that they are still able to meet the Technical Standards. The CPHS Doctor of Pharmacy Program is committed to providing reasonable accom -68 | 2022-2023 A CAdemi C BUlletiNmodation to ensure that equal access is provided to all otherwise qualified students in the course of study leading to the Doctor of Pharmacy degree and licensure. Accommodations Candidates pursuing the academic program who lack the ability to appropriately meet these standards and who do not seek accommodations may place themselves in academic jeopardy. The use of an intermediary, a person trained to perform essential skills on behalf of the student, is not permitted. Should a candidate student pharmacist develop a condition during their education in the Doctor of Pharmacy program that would affect their ability to meet the above Technical Standards, they must contact the Director of Disability Services to determine whether or not a reasonable accommo - dation can be made. Again, candidates pursuing the academic program who lose the ability to appropriately meet these standards and who do not seek accommo - dations may place themselves in academic jeopardy. The Director of Disability Services will meet with the student to discuss areas of concern. The Director will then develop an accommodation plan, consulting regularly with the CPHS Office of Academic Affairs, the CPHS Office of Admissions & Student Affairs, the CPHS Office of Experiential Education, the CPHS Pharmacy Practice Department, and other offices as needed during the process. The accommodation plan will require the approval of the above departments, Student Success, and the student. Appeals Process Accepted students who are unable to meet the Technical Standards, with or without accommodation, will not be offered admission and will be notified by the Admissions Committee. Enrolled students who are found not to meet the Technical Standards, with or without accommodation, will be evaluated by the CPHS Academic Performance and Standards Committee and will use the appeals process for that committee's work. Student-pharmacists who disagree with an accommodation decision made by the office of Student Success will use that office's grievance process which can be found in the \"Student Guide to Accessing Disability Services\" on the Student Success website. The above standards mirror our current CPHS PA program technical standards and were modified based on language incorporated from the Technical Standards documents of University of Mississippi, University of Iowa, Kentucky University, and University of California, San Francisco schools of pharmacy. Academic Standards Retention and Promotion Criteria Students enrolled in the Doctor of Phar - macy program at the College of Pharmacy & Health Sciences are expected to make satisfactory academic progress toward completion of the degree requirements. Satisfactory academic progress is defined as successful completion in the prescribed time, maintenance of a 2.2 semester grade point average (SGPA) and a cumulative grade point average (CGPA), and comple - tion of any professional deficiencies and/or required remedial courses in the time and manner prescribed. Students who fail to maintain satisfactory academic progress in the professional program are automatically placed on academic probation. A letter from the Academic Performance & Standards Committee will be sent to students placed on academic probation containing specific guidance. These letters are individualized and may contain specific actions that must be taken as well as helpful suggestions to assist each student. Students may be required to meet with an assigned contact to develop an academic contract, to participate in academic counseling, or to be enrolled in a remedial program of study. Demonstration of continued poor academic performance by students on probation could result in suspension or dismissal as indicated by the policies described in the subsequent sections. Such actions will be determined by the Academic Performance and Standards Committee, with notification to the associate dean for academic affairs. The student will be notified of these actions by the chair of the Academic Performance and Standards Committee. Actions taken in these matters are not to be viewed as punitive, but as a recognition that it is unrealistic to continue in a course of study where there is little probability of success. These same standards will be applied to students enrolled in an approved part-time course of study. 1. Academic Probation Academic probation is the initial action for a student failing to make satisfactory academic progress. A student will be placed on academic probation for: Failure to maintain a minimum SGPA of 2.20; Failure to maintain a CGPA of 2.20; A failing grade in a professionally required course; Unauthorized failure to complete any degree requirement at the prescribed time. Depending on the nature of the academic deficiencies and overall academic record, a student placed on academic probation may or may not be permitted to continue in the regular sequence of the professional curriculum. A student failing a course in sequence may be permitted to take the next course in the sequence, if directed by the Academic Performance and Standards Committee as part of a modified course of study, or by gaining written permission from the associate dean for academic affairs. Students placed on academic probation have two weeks from the notification from APSC to meet with Support Services to develop a CPHS success plan. Failure to do so may result in suspension or dismissal from the program. If a student fails a professionally required course, it must be repeated during the next term the course is offered. A student placed on academic probation is typically given one semester to correct any grade point deficiencies. The Academic Performance and Standards Committee will review the student's record at the end of the term of probation: If the SGPA for that term is 2.20 or above, and the CGPA is 2.20 or above, the student will be released from academic probation. If SGPA is 2.20 or above, but the CGPA is below 2.20, the student will remain on academic probation. A student remaining on academic probation for more than two consecutive semesters will be subject to suspension or dismissal. If a student fails to make satisfactory progress during the period of academic probation, and/or fails to correct aca - demic deficiencies, within the prescribed time, that student will be subject to automatic suspension and may be dismissed from CPHS. 2. Academic Suspension Academic Suspension from CPHS occurs when a student: Has failed to make satisfactory progress as demonstrated by SGPA less than 2.20. Has academic deficiencies which pre - clude continuation in a normal program of study, but may be expected to be able to complete the requirements for the degree under a modified program of study with or without remedial courses;PHARMACY | 69 Has received a failing grade in any two professionally required courses. Suspensions are imposed for a specified pe - riod of time and must not exceed one year. A student on academic suspension is not allowed to continue the standard course of study. The Academic Performance and Standards Committee will specify the length of time of the suspension, remedial work re - quired for reinstatement, and the program of study required upon re-instatement. Stu - dents placed on academic suspension have two weeks from the notification from APSC to meet with Support Services to develop a CPHS success plan. Failure to do so may result in dismissal from the program. 3. Academic Dismissal Academic dismissal from CPHS will occur when a student: Fails to make satisfactory progress during a period of academic probation or suspension; Has academic deficiencies which preclude continuation in the prescribed program of study and may not rea - sonably be expected to complete the requirements of the degree. Except under very extenuating circumstanc - es, academic dismissal will be recommend - ed if a student: Was previously suspended from the College and again failed to make satisfactory academic progress; Is on academic suspension under a remedial course of study and again fails to make satisfactory academic progress as demonstrated by SGPA less than 2.20; Fails a single professionally required course more than one time, or accumu - lates two or more failures in profession - ally required courses; Accumulates a grade point deficiency which reasonably precludes the possibility of completing the degree requirements. A student dismissed from the College may seek re-entry by applying for re-admission using the standard admissions process. Students In Academic Difficulty Leadership Position Policy Any student on probation or suspension for a stated period is automatically ineligible to: Hold or run for elected officer position in student professional organizations; Represent the University in any capacity either on campus or away from campus (see policy below for additional information); Compete for honors and distinctions; Participate as an elected representative or member of an honorary organization; Obtain reimbursement monies from any funders in the College of Pharmacy & Health Sciences (see policy below for additional information); Students in academic difficulty will con - tact the CPHS Student Affairs office to coordinate an officer position transition within one week of academic status notification. Remediation Policy for the Classes of 2023-2025 The goal of this remediation policy is to provide the underperforming student with a means to overcome any deficien - cies in achieving the competency in the required course material if failure of one examination in one course results in course failure. The student is expected to seek individualized assistance during the course as needed. Students having academic diffi - culties should utilize tutoring services and meet with the course director/instructor for guidance. Remediation is only available for course failure related to academic perfor - mance and not failures due to academic dishonesty, honor code violations, or other professionalism issues. Eligibility: 1. A student is eligible for remediation if they fail a required course based on underperformance on a single exam - ination. A student is NOT eligible for remediation if failure is based on lack of attendance, multiple examination failures, or failure to complete assigned work. 2. Students may remediate only one course assessment during the remediation period. 3. A student is allowed only one attempt at remediation for a given course. 4. Students will be allowed to remediate no more than three times during years one to three of the professional degree program with no more than one course remediated in the same block. A student is not allowed to remediate a fourth didactic course and is automatically dismissed from the program. This dismissal may be appealed within three days of notification to the Academic Performance and Standards Committee (APSC) and then to the associate dean for academic affairs within three days of notification. Procedures and Grading: 1. The remediation process occurs during the week between each block and the week at the end of an academic semester. 2. Remediation procedures will include assessment as deemed appropriate by the course director. The student and the course director/instructor will agree upon the remediation plan. Examples of plan content may include items such as exam date, meeting times, or assign - ments. 3. Students may not remediate and take an IPPE or an APPE at the same time. 4. A student who is unsuccessful at reme - diation will earn a failing grade and will be required to retake the course either utilizing the Course Repeat policy or the next time the course is offered. 5. The student is required to achieve a score of 70% or better for the assess - ment. The maximum score recorded for the assessment is 70%. The new grade will replace the failed examination in the calculation of the course grade. Failure to pass the course after remediation will result in an F grade in the course and a requirement to retake the course. 6. Multiple course failures in a block/se - mester will prevent student progression and require repeating the unsuccessful block/semester after review and recom - mendation by the APSC. Remediation Policy for the Classes of 2026 and Beyond The goal of this 2-phase remediation policy is to provide early detection and intervention for at-risk students with the goal of achieving competency in the required course material. Remediation is only available for exam/assessment failure related to academic performance and not exam/assessment failures due to academic dishonesty, honor code violations, or other professionalism issues. Experiential education, PPS labs, and PPD courses are excluded from this policy. Phase 1 Remediation (non-graded remediation) Eligibility: A student is eligible for phase 1 remediation if they fail an exam/assessment prior to Block Exam 3 in a required course. Phase 1 Remediation Procedures and Grading: 1. Students who fail an exam/assessment prior to Block Exam 3 are required to meet with and seek assistance from the course coordinator(s) and instructor(s) within three business days of the failure. If the Student does not contact the course director(s) within three business days, the course directors(s) must notify the Office of Academic Affairs via e-mail. If the student is not in compliance, the Office of Student Affairs will refer the student to the Academic Performance and Standards Committee (APSC) with a guest from the Student Conduct and Professionalism Committee. 70 | 2022-2023 A CAdemi C BUlletiN2. Students who fail an exam prior to Block Exam 3 are also required to utilize sup - port services from the Office of Student Affairs (which may include tutoring) for the remainder of the course. 3. Students who failed an exam/assess - ment prior to Block Exam 3 must complete a remediation plan. The course director/instructor sets up the remediation plan agreement with the student. The plan should include but is not limited to regular meetings with the course director/instructor and assessments of students' understanding of the material. These assessments are not graded, but rather a time of learning. Meetings may be in-person or virtual. Please see course syllabus for the course's remediation procedures. Time limits are up to the course director but should generally be completed within 2 weeks of failed exam. 4. A student who does not pass the course with phase 1 remediation such that the course is failed will be allowed to enter phase 2 of remediation if they meet phase 2 remediation eligibility criteria. 5. Phase 1 remediation is not available for the following courses: PPD courses and clinical rotations. Phase 2 Remediation (graded remediation) Eligibility: 1. A student is eligible for phase 2 remedi - ation if they fail a required course based on underperformance on a single ex - amination. A student is NOT eligible for phase 2 remediation if failure is based on lack of attendance, multiple examination failures, or failure to complete assigned work. 2. 2. Students may remediate only one course assessment during the phase 2 remediation period. 3. 3. A student is allowed only one attempt at phase 2 remediation for a given course. 4. 4. Students will be allowed to phase 2 remediate no more than three times during years one to three of the professional degree program with no more than one course remediated in the same block. A student is not allowed to remediate a fourth didactic course and is automatically dismissed from the program. This dismissal may be appealed within three days of notification to the APSC and then to the associate dean for academic affairs within three days of notification. Phase 2 Remediation Procedures and Grading: 1. The phase 2 remediation process occurs during the week between each block and the week at the end of an academic semester and may be extended an extra week as determined by the course director. 2. Remediation procedures will include assessment as deemed appropriate by the course director. The student and the course director/instructor will agree upon the remediation plan. Examples of plan content may include items such as exam date, meeting times, or assign - ments. It is suggested that a similar assessment to the failed assessment is utilized for Phase 2 remediation. 3. Students may not remediate and take an IPPE or an APPE at the same time. 4. A student who is unsuccessful at reme - diation will earn a failing grade and will be required to retake the course either utilizing the Course Repeat policy or the next time the course is offered. 5. The student is required to achieve a score of 70% or better for the assess - ment. The maximum score recorded for the assessment is 70%. The new grade will replace the failed examination in the calculation of the course grade. Failure to pass the course after remediation will result in an F grade in the course and a requirement to retake the course. 6. Multiple course failures in a block/se - mester will prevent student progression and require repeating the unsuccessful block/semester after review and recom - mendation by the APSC. Course Repeat Policy After a Failure of a Non-Experiential Course Occurs If a student fails a course despite the efforts made for early academic difficulty detection, re-taking of the course will be required. The student may be allowed to re- take the course during summer session or may be required to re-take the course dur - ing the next academic year when the course is regularly offered. The determination will be made by the Academic Performance and Standards Committee (APSC) and the decision can be appealed within three days of notification to the associate dean for academic affairs, College of Pharmacy & Health Sciences. As directed by the APSC, the student may take the course again in the following summer session after the original course was taken. For example, if a student fails PHRD XXX, he/she will register for and re-take it as a summer course. This will result in additional tuition charges for the summer course, which may be assessed on a per-credit hour basis. A student may only take the course by authorization of the APSC and approval by the CPHS associate dean for academic affairs. The repeated course will be a Summer Session III registered course. The actual duration and schedule for the course will be determined by the course director. It is recommend - ed that the course duration meets the following criteria: a minimum of 1 week per credit hour and a maximum of 2 weeks per credit hour. The repeated course should be similar in scope and content to the original course. The course will be available to the student primarily as a self-directed module with the student(s) viewing the lectures that were recorded at the time the student was originally enrolled in the course. The course will be supplemented with weekly conferences with the instructor(s) to ensure student progress. Weekly conferences with the instructor(s) may be held in person, via email, by phone, or with other tech - nology (at the discretion of the individual instructor). A comparable number of exams should be administered during the repeated course. Exams may be of a different format, with a different number of questions; however, the exams should cover the same material covered during the regular course. Exams may be given via ExamSoft. The student will be required to take all course exams ON CAMPUS as offered through the course director or his/her affiliate. Exam dates will be communicated at the beginning of the course. Exam dates, office hours, or conference times with the instructor(s) will also be specified in the syllabus. Whether the student passes or fails the remediation course, his or her progression in the curriculum will be determined by the APSC. In addition, any student who has NOT failed a course, but has a cumulative GPA lower than 2.2, may also take a repeated course if it is recommended by the APSC and approved by the CPHS associate dean for academic affairs. Students will only be allowed to take 1 summer course per summer. If greater than 1 course is required for matriculation, the student should repeat any additional courses during the regularly scheduled Fall/ Spring semester. Students may only take a summer course when recommended by the APSC.PHARMACY | 71Advancement to a Higher Class Advancement to a higher class requires: To a Second Professional Year 1. A cumulative grade point average of 2.20 or higher 2. Completion of all first professional year didactic courses 3. Completion of all professional require - ments 4. Exceptions may be granted by the Academic Performance and Standards Committee and/or the associate dean for academic affairs To a Third Professional Year 1. A cumulative grade point average of 2.20 or higher 2. Completion of all second professional year didactic courses 3. Completion of all professional require - ments 4. Exceptions may be granted by the Academic Performance and Standards Committee and/or the associate dean for academic affairs To a Fourth Professional Year 1. A cumulative grade point average of 2.20 or higher 2. Completion of all third professional year didactic courses 3. Completion of all professional require - ments 4. Successful completion of both Introduc - tory to Pharmacy Practice rotations in Community and Hospital Pharmacy Delayed Graduation Policy If a student pharmacist is required to re- take a class as a result of a specific didactic course failure or a deficiency in overall academic performance, then the post - ponement of the upcoming introductory pharmacy practice experiences (IPPE) or advanced pharmacy practice experiences (APPE) will occur and the student's gradua - tion may be delayed. Student pharmacists who must repeat any P1 or P2 didactic coursework will not be able to complete their IPPE until December of the current year or the summer of the next year. P3 student pharmacists who must repeat any P3 didactic coursework will not be able to start their P4 (APPE) year before August of that year. A delay in the start of experiential training can possibly delay the target graduation date. Voluntary course withdrawals or a temporary separation may also cause a delay in scheduling the IPPE or APPE and a delay in graduation. Any alteration in the normal curriculum progression may affect a student's financial aid status or qualifi- cati - on for education-based financial aid.Refer to Experiential Training for Rotation Repeat Policy. For specific counseling and advice students should contact the College's Office of Academic Affairs and the University's Office of Financial Aid. Student pharmacists are not allowed to start any P-4 APPE until he or she has successfully completed all P-1, P-2, and P-3 coursework, including Introductory Pharmacy Practice Experiences (IPPE). If an APPE must be rescheduled for any reason (including, but not limited to a ro - tation cancellation, rotation failure, course failure, not documenting all necessary requirements for site clearance or CPHS en - rollment, medical illness, etc.), the OPEE will make every reasonable effort to reschedule the rotation for the next semester or term; however, the OPEE implies no guarantee of on-time graduation if placement for a rotation is not available. In order to forestall educational loan repayment, a student must enroll at least half-time (six credit hours) when repeating fall courses. If a student fails one or more courses, this includes IPPE or APPE rotations, it may be necessary to delay his or her graduation due to limited course offerings or unavaila - bility of appropriate training sites. A student cannot graduate until all coursework (including all experiential training) has been completed and verified by the Registrar's office. This means a student cannot be enrolled in an APPE in May, August, or December and graduate in that same month/year. Transfer Students CPHS does not accept transfer students directly into the Doctor of Pharmacy program. The College utilizes a process to evaluate potential students that may differ from other programs. In addition, there is a great deal of het - erogeneity among Doctor of Pharmacy curricula across the nation. The scheduling difficulties for correcting potential course deficits become extremely complicated. Furthermore, the College could only consid - er such requests if space becomes available due to a decrease in the number of enrolled students; therefore, CPHS has determined that accepting transfer students with advanced standing is not in the best interest of the student nor the College. The College feels it would not be providing consistent opportunity for all students. As a result, students currently enrolled in a Doctor of Pharmacy program in the United States should apply to CPHS as an entry-level student. Interested individuals must follow the procedures for admission. Applicants must be in good academic stand - ing and have a letter from the dean of their institution supporting the request. These admissions decisions will be handled in the same manner as all other applicants to the College by the actions of the Admissions Committee. Any individual admitted to CPHS who has completed coursework in another Doctor of Pharmacy program or another graduate/ professional degree may formally request transfer of credits. All accepted transfer students seeking \"advanced standing\" through the transfer of credits must submit a formal request as outlined in the policy and procedure for course transfer and waiver in the CPHS Academic Bulletin. All prerequisites must be met prior to ma - triculation to the Doctor of Pharmacy pro - gram at Campbell University. CPHS reserves the right to make changes in requirements for admission, curriculum, standards for progression, advancement and graduation, fees and rules and regulations. To apply to the Doctor of Pharmacy program, please follow the policies and procedures in the admissions portion of the CPHS Academic Bulletin. Transfer Credit & Course Waiver Policy Students may formally request an eval - uation of previously earned professional coursework for transfer credit or the waiver of course requirements of pre-professional and professional courses. Each course transferred or waived must be by written, affirmative acceptance of the associate dean for academic affairs. The process for transfer or course-waiver is not automatic. The review of transfer courses or course-waivers may only be initiated after a student has enrolled or been accepted for enrollment and paid the matriculation deposit for the Doctor of Pharmacy program. CPHS can only accept transfer of equivalent professional courses from an ACPE accredited institution. A student may transfer equivalent profession - al courses that meet the requirements of the curriculum. To be eligible for transfer and replacement of a course in the professional curriculum, the requested course for transfer must meet all of the following requirements: Be documented on an official transcript provided by the registrar of the accredit - ed institution Have an earned grade of 70% or higher, or a grade of \"C\" or greater72 | 2022-2023 A CAdemi C BUlletiN Be of the same general content and level of instruction as the equivalent course in the CPHS Doctor of Pharmacy curriculum at the time requesting transfer Be equal or greater in the number of semester credit hours as the course required in the CPHS professional curriculum A student granted transfer credit will not be required to enroll or pay tuition and fees for the transferred course; however, full-time tuition is charged to all students enrolled in at least 12 semester hours. Upon approval for transfer, the student will be given credit for the transferred course on the official transcript. Credit hours for transferred courses that exceed the number of credits for the equivalent course at CPHS will not count towards elective credits in the curriculum. A student may formally request to receive a course-waiver for a required course in the Doctor of Pharmacy curriculum provided the student successfully completed an upper division or graduate course that: Is completed from an accredited institu - tion recognized by CPHS Is documented on an official transcript provided by the registrar or equivalent of the accredited institution Has an earned grade of 80% or higher, or a grade of \"B\" or greater Be of the equivalent general content and level of instruction as the equivalent course in the CPHS Doctor of Pharmacy curriculum at the time of the request for waiver Be equal or greater in the number of semester credit hours as the course required in the CPHS Doctor of Pharma - cy curriculum A student granted a course-waiver would not be required to enroll in the equivalent professional course or be given degree program credit for the waived course. The student will be required to complete an equivalent number of semester credit hours in elective offerings to meet the total degree requirements for the Doctor of Pharmacy program. Procedure 1. An enrolled student or deposited appli - cant must present a signed letter to the associate dean of admissions & student affairs describing the course(s) in the professional curriculum that the student or applicant seeks to transfer or receive course-waiver. The following should be included with the letter: -Documentation that the student or applicant has, before submitting the letter, made a request to the registrar of the previous institution to submit official documentation of the course(s) directly to CPHS, and has paid the appropriate fees, if any, to the previous institution to process the document -Appropriate documentation to support the equivalence of the proposed transfer course or course-waiver as determined by CPHS 2. Upon receipt of the letter and documen - tation, the associate dean of admissions & student affairs will determine the applicant's status for enrollment or acceptance to the Doctor of Pharmacy program and payment of the matric - ulation deposit. The associate dean of admissions & student affairs will communicate in writing the status of the application to the applicant, including any requirements that must be met by the applicant prior to processing the request. 3. The associate dean of admissions & student affairs will maintain the letter and documentation until such time as CPHS receives the official documentation from the previous institution(s). Upon receipt, the associate dean will transmit the request to the associate dean for academic affairs for evaluation and recommended disposition. 4. The associate dean for academic affairs will evaluate the transcript, course(s) and documentation submitted. If the associate dean for academic affairs has any question as to the equivalence of the course(s), he or she may contact the previous institution to secure additional information. If the associate dean for academic affairs determines that the submitted documentation is insufficient to determine equivalency, he or she may contact the applicant or previous institution to secure adequate docu - mentation, or return the application to the applicant with an explanation of the required documentation to determine equivalence. 5. If the associate dean for academic affairs is not familiar with the content, he or she shall consult with the appropriate course director to determine course equivalency. 6. The associate dean for academic affairs shall make the final determination of the acceptance of the course transfer or waiver and communicate his or her decision in writing to the applicant and the Campbell University registrar. The decision of the associate dean shall be final. Grading Scale for Doctor of Pharmacy Program The following is the grading scales for the Doctor of Pharmacy program at CPHS with the assigned quality points: Grade Quality of Work 4-Pt. Scale A Superior/Excellent 4 B Above average 3 C Average 2 F Failure 0 I Incomplete 0 IC Incomplete continued 0 AU Audit 0 P Passing (graduate only) 0 H Honors (graduate only) 0 Grades of \"A, B, C, F, and I\" are included in semester hours attempted and will affect the grade point average. Grades of \"IC, AU, and P\" will not affect the grade point average. A grade of \"I\" must be removed by the completion of the work within 30 days after the opening of the next semester; oth - erwise, it will be recorded as an \"F.\" A grade of \"IC\" must be removed by the completion of the work within 120 days. A student pharmacist may appeal a grade for his/her didactic courwork within three days in which the grade was officially post- ed. Changes can be made to the transcript within a 12-month period if a professor acknowledges in writing that an error in grade reporting occurred. Matriculation Policies Students admitted in the Doctor of Pharma - cy program and students currently enrolled in the program are required to fulfill or maintain the following for enrollment: Submit the required non-refundable admissions deposit. Submit a signed honor code form indicating that the student has received, read, understands and agrees to adhere to the provisions of the honor code of the Campbell University College of Pharmacy & Health Sciences Submit original transcripts from each college or university where any course- work was completed (undergraduate, graduate, professional, etc.) to the Office of Admissions & Student Affairs prior to the beginning of classes. It is strongly preferred that transcripts are sent at the end of each semester during the application process.PHARMACY | 73 Complete all prerequisite coursework prior to matriculation with official tran - scripts submitted as mentioned above. Complete the required vaccination and immunization requirements, including the Hepatitis B series or proof of immunity, the varicella vaccine or proof of immunity, TD/Tdap, MMR, annual influenza vaccine, COVID vaccination, and a TB screening (skin test, blood test, chest x-ray, if history of positive screen - ing test), and symptom attestation form. Submit and maintain completion documentation of the American Heart Association (AHA) Basic Life Support (BLS) for Health Care Providers cer - tification. Only the AHA certification is accepted due to requirements set by our clinical affiliates. Incoming P1 student pharmacists who do not have a certification prior to the start of classes due to late acceptance must identify and complete a AHA BLS course within 90 days of enrollment or he/she will not be allowed to matriculate. Documentation of BLS Certification must be maintained and approved in the compliance and immunization management system. Failure to meet this standard will delay the start of the Introductory Pharmacy Practice Experiences (IPPEs) or Advanced Pharmacy Practice Experiences (APPEs) and potentially delay graduation. As directed by the Office of Professional Experiential Education (OPEE), student pharmacists must maintain an up-to- date record of all required documen - tation in the immunization/compliance management system. Submit to an annual criminal background check. CPHS applicants and student pharmacists are required to self-disclose any misdemeanors and felony charges or convictions, other than minor traffic violations, including deferred adjudi - cations, with the understanding that non- disclosure or falsification may lead to dismissal and disclosure may prevent enrollment. Additionally, in response to requirements in the professional practice environment , facilities provid - ing care to patients must minimize the risk to patients that may be presented by persons with prior criminal activity; therefore, a criminal background check will be completed on all accepted appli - cants prior to matriculation. Please refer to the General Information section at the back of this bulletin for the Criminal Background Check Policy. Submit to scheduled and random substance abuse screens each year as necessitated by the College and its affiliates. Attend all mandatory orientation ses - sions as applicable for new and returning students. Complete all programmatic standards as required by the College of Pharmacy & Health Sciences. Confirm there are no CU Business Office \"holds\" on their student account(s). Complete the professional PharmD program within a maximum of six years from initial professional curriculum matriculation. Graduation Requirements Complete all required courses with a passing grade in each course and a 2.20 cumulative GPA Students have a maximum of six years from initial professional curriculum ma - triculation to complete all requirements for the Doctor of Pharmacy degree. Ensure appropriate graduation pa - perwork is properly completed and submitted in the timeframe specified by the University. Receive an approving recommendation by the CPHS faculty. Fulfill all financial obligations to the institution. Complete all required documentation for graduation including post rotation responsibilities (i.e. competencies). Attend in person each session of the CPHS Board Review. Attend the applicable commencement ceremony. Commencement Participation Policy Doctor of Pharmacy candidates that are on track to graduate in August, who are in good academic standing and missing no more than twelve (12) credit hours of meeting all requirements to graduate with a Doctor of Pharmacy degree may file a \"Request to participate in the May Commencement.\" Students with more than twelve (12) credit hours remaining at the May ceremony can participate in the next University graduation cycle. Forms requesting participation in the May CPHS ceremony are available in the CPHS office of Academic Affairs. Candidates applying for this exemption must also submit an Application for Graduation through the Registrar's office. If approved, the candidate will be allowed to participate in only one Commencement program for the degree in question. Candidates participating under this special exemption will not receive a diploma or Certificate of Graduation until all requirements have been met. They must submit a new application for graduation for the term in which the degree will actually be conferred. In addition, students partici - pating also must understand that participat - ing in graduation does not infer that they have met all the requirements for degree certification. A student participating, under this exemption, in the May ceremony would not be eligible for certification by the NC Board of Pharmacy until all requirements have been met and certified by the Office of Academic Affairs and Registrar's office. Experiential Training The Office of Professional Experiential Education (OPEE) within the Department of Pharmacy Practice coordinates all experi - ential training for the PharmD candidates. Student pharmacists complete introductory pharmacy practice experiences (IPPEs) and advanced pharmacy practice experiences (APPEs) so that when combined with their didactic education they graduate as practice-ready pharmacists. During experiential training, students are responsible for all travel expenses, housing arrangements, and incidental expenses such as parking fees. Students may also be responsible for onboarding fees charged by a clinical site. Information regarding expenses associated with each training site may be obtained from the OPEE. Clinical Rotation Sites Throughout North Carolina there are numerous affiliated training sites ranging from large tertiary care hospitals, such as Duke University Medical Center and Atrium Health Baptist Medical Center, to smaller community hospitals, chain and independ - ent community pharmacies, and long-term care facilities. Clinical rotation sites are established in the following global areas of practice (please note, this is not an all-inclusive list and sites are subject to change): Academic Pharmacy Advanced Community Pharmacy* Advanced Hospital* Ambulatory Care* Cardiology Clinical Research Community Management Drug Information Emergency Medicine Geriatrics* Hospital Management Infectious Disease Intensive Care Internal Medicine I* & II* Nuclear Pharmacy74 | 2022-2023 A CAdemi C BUlletiN Oncology Pediatrics Pharmacy Administration Professional Association Management Psychiatry Surgery Veterinary Pharmacy *Required rotation The OPEE makes every effort to secure availability based on student preference; however, student pharmacists must be prepared to fulfill training requirements wherever they are assigned. The OPEE does not guarantee placement at a site or in a desired month. Students are assigned to sites with an established affiliation agreement with CPHS. Out-of-state sites are generally not approved for IPPEs or APPEs. Introductory Pharmacy Practice Experiences Student pharmacists who successfully complete all required prerequisite work in the first and second years as well as all on-boarding requirements for clinical training will complete a one month (160 hour, minimum) introductory rotation in community pharmacy and an introductory rotation in hospital pharmacy, respectively. These courses will be completed in either May, June, or July (summer term) or in De - cember (fall term). Student pharmacists will register for the IPPE in the term the course is completed and the earned grade (pass, P, or fail, F) will be recorded during the corresponding term. Students completing their IPPE during the summer term will not be charged any additional tuition beyond the fall and spring term for that year. In the event that a student pharmacist cannot or elects not to complete the IPPE in either the summer term or in December following the first year, he/ she must complete both IPPEs during the summer/fall terms following the second year. If a student pharmacist receives a grade of Fail (F) on an IPPE, the grade will be submit - ted to the registrar's office and recorded on the student's transcript. The student will not be allowed to reschedule the failed rotation in the same term; therefore, the grade will remain on the transcript. If a student pharmacist is unsuccessful at either of the IPPEs, then he/she will be resched - uled for another introductory rotation of the same type either the following fall term (December), or the next summer term where applicable. The Academic Performance and Standards Committee will review each student failing an IPPE per the CPHS course failure policy.Advanced Pharmacy Practice Experiences Student pharmacists successfully com - pleting all required coursework in the preceding three years, including both IPPEs, are eligible to register for the APPEs, or P4 rotations. The completion of nine rotations (1440 hours) in advanced community, ambulatory care I and II or ambulatory care I and geriatrics, internal medicine I and II, advanced hospital, and three electives is required. Grades for APPEs are recorded as either Honors (H), Pass (P), or Fail (F). Students usually complete their APPEs in May through April preceeding expected graduation. If an APPE must be rescheduled for any rea - son other than rotation failure (including, but not limited to a rotation cancellation, not documenting all necessary require - ments for site clearance, medical illness, etc.), the OPEE will make every effort to reschedule the rotation for the next open month in the student's P4 schedule; however, the OPEE implies no guarantee of on-time graduation if placement for a rotation is not available. If a student pharmacist receives a grade of F (fail) for an APPE, the grade will be recorded on his/her transcript; moreover, the student cannot be rescheduled for the rotation (course) again within the same term pre - venting grade replacement. The Academic Performance and Standards Committee will review each student failing an APPE per the CPHS course failure policy. APPEs are not completed in succession. If a student pharmacist's rotation cycle exceeds more than one calendar year (12 months) for any reason beyond OPEE's inability to find suitable placement, he/ she will be responsible for the per credit hour cost of each rotation. If a student pharma - cist's rotation cycle exceeds more than one calendar year (12 months) due to the OPEE's inability to find suitable placement, there will be no additional cost for the rotation. Once a student pharmacist begins his/her P4 rotations, all rotations must be com - pleted within a two-year (24 month) time frame. If a student pharmacist is granted a temporary separation during the APPE cycle that exceeds two years (24 months), then all rotations prior to the leave must be repeated. If a student pharmacist is granted a temporary separation during the APPE cycle that exceeds one year (12 months), he/she will automatically be referred to the Academic Performance and Standards Committee for recommendations regarding successful re-entry into the program..Registration of Rotations and Billing The OPEE will register students and submit grades for all IPPEs and APPEs. Student pharmacists with any CU Business Office hold on their account cannot register for their experiential course; therefore, they will not be able to start any rotation (IPPE or APPE) until the CU Business office has cleared the student through the CPHS Office of Academic Affairs. Students are registered according to his/her actual rotation schedule. Students will only be charged one program fee for the fourth year; one- half of the fee will be incurred in the fall term and the other half during the spring term. In the sample schedule below, the student will be registered in the summer, fall, and spring terms; however, one-half of the program fee will be assessed in the fall and the other half in the spring. No program fee will be incurred in the summer. registering for less than three APPES (12 credit hours) will not be consid - ered a full time student and financial aid may be impacted. Due to the Office of the Registrar's closing date for submission of fall grades (early to mid-December), students completing an IPPE or APPE in December will receive an in - complete (IC) recorded as their initial course grade. Once all rotation requirements are satisfied, and the final grade is recorded in the rotation management system, the OPEE will submit a Grade Change Form to the registrar's office. Student pharmacists completing an IPPE or APPE in the sum - mer term will receive a grade during the same term. However, due to the Office of Registrar's closing date for submission of summer grades (middle of July), students completing an IPPE/APPE in July will receive an IC recorded as their initial course grade. Once all rotation requirements are satisfied and the final grade is recorded in the rotation management system, the OPEE will submit a Grade Change Form to the registrar's office.PHARMACY | 75It is recommended that once clearance and onboarding procedures are completed for IPPEs or APPEs , student pharmacists should not travel abroad except for Campbell University-sponsored international travel (i.e.: mission trips, international electives, etc.) which is cleared through CU Global Engagement. Whether traveling internationally on CU's behalf or for personal reasons, the OPEE recommends students familiarize them - selves with the political, health, crime, and other safety-related conditions of their travel destination and follow the Center for Disease Control's recommendations. Requirements for Pharmacy Internship Regulations regarding internship licensure require that the experience is obtained after acceptance to the College of Pharmacy & Health Sciences (CPHS). Information pertinent to internship licensing among the various states is available from the board of pharmacy webpages for each respective state. Successful completion of the CPHS experiential clerkship program will suffice for the internship requirement in the state of North Carolina. Students seeking internships or planning to take the state pharmacy board exam outside of North Carolina are responsible for reviewing the respective state's requirements for informa- tion regarding out of state intern licensure and pharmacy licensure post- graduation. Drug Information Center Established in 1987 with a grant from GlaxoSmithKline, the Drug Information Center (DIC) is an invaluable asset to the College of Pharmacy & Health Sciences (CPHS) providing experiential training for student pharmacists and a service to health care professionals. The Center receives ap - proximately 175 requests per month from a variety of settings including community pharmacies, clinics, and hospitals. The DIC is an optional rotation site for stu - dents wishing to complete an elective APPE in drug information. During the rotation, student pharmacists become competent in data retrieval, literature evaluation, and both written and verbal communication skills. They respond to inquiries from health care professionals regarding contemporary therapeutic regimens in humans and animals. Purpose To serve the health professions community by answering drug-related questions; To provide a learning center for student pharmacists, residents, and other student health care professionals in which drug information skills can be developed; To function as a resource center for faculty, students, and other health care professionals; To aid in the promotion of CPHS by offering drug information services throughout the state. Services Most of the drug information services offered by the DIC are provided free of charge. These services include: Provision of drug information and supporting documentation to questions posed by health care practitioners Provision of consultative services in various areas Participation in pharmacy-related research Hours of Operation 8:30 a.m.-5 p.m., Monday through Friday (Closed Holidays) Contact Phone: (800) 327-5467 (NC) (800) requests: https://cphs.campbell.edu/centers-pro - grams/drug-information-center Residency Programs The College of Pharmacy & Health Scienc - es (CPHS) offers a variety of pharmacy residency programs. Residents at CPHS are afforded the opportunity to enhance their clinical, research, teaching and critical think - ing skills to meet the demands and changes occurring in the profession of pharmacy. PGY2 Residencies Internal Medicine Cape Fear Valley Medical Center The Cape Fear Valley Medical Center PGY2 Internal Medicine Pharmacy Residency program is designed to produce a well - rounded, independent internal medi - cine clinical specialist through experiences in clinical practice as well as teaching, research, and professional activities. The primary emphasis the residency program will be on the development of practice skills in adult internal medicine. Required learning experiences include 5 months of Internal Medicine with either a clinical or teaching focus and varying responsibilities. Inpatient Family Medicine and Drug Information are also required learning experiences. Residents will also complete rotations in Infectious Diseases and Cardiology if not completed as a PGY1. Throughout the year, the resident will also manage longitudinal learning experiences in research, academia, administration, and transitions of care. Clinical skills and responsibilities will be developed and enhanced under the mentorship of multi - ple preceptors. The resident will engage in teaching experiences allowing them to develop and refine communication skills and abilities as a teacher by completing teaching certificate courses offered by Campbell University Col - lege of Pharmacy & Health Sciences. As part of the residency training, the resident will also have an appointment as a clinical in - structor with Campbell University, and will have the opportunity to teach pharmacy students in various didactic settings as well as precept students in clinical settings. The resident will participate in ongoing scholarly activities to further develop problem-solv - ing skills and ability to interpret, generate, and disseminate knowledge. PGY1 Residencies PGY1 Community-Based Pharmacy residencies. The residencies are offered in conjunction with Walgreens, located in Dunn, NC and Josefs Pharmacy in Raleigh, NC. Residents develop advanced community pharmacy practice skills and gain valuable experience in immunizations, medication therapy management, disease state management, and specialty pharmacy. They work with their preceptors to enhance or develop new clinical services beneficial to patients of the community they serve. In addition to direct patient care respon - sibilities, the resident is involved in the didactic and clinical training of student pharmacists and other health care pro - fessionals. Residents complete an original research project and present their results at state and national meetings. The residents are also involved with pharmacy advocacy at a state level through projects with the North Carolina Association of Pharamcists (NCAP). Harnett Health System Campbell University and Harnett Health System offer a PGY1 residency program that is designed to develop the knowledge and skills necessary to provide exemplary pharmaceutical care. Upon completion of the residency program, residents should be able to practice as clinical pharmacists responsible for the medication related care of patients with a wide range of conditions, 76 | 2022-2023 A CAdemi C BUlletiNeligible for board certification, and eligible for postgraduate year two (PGY2) pharmacy residency training. The program will offer 2 PGY1 positions. The required clinical rotations include two months in internal medicine, and one month in each of the following: cardiology, critical care, pharmacy administration, and infectious disease. Elective rotations include pediatrics, emergency medicine, information systems, ambulatory care, drug information, and oncology. Harnett Health System is comprised of two hospitals, seven primary care physician offices, and four specialty care clinics. The pharmacy resident will spend a major - ity of their time participating in rounding with interprofessional teams, comprising of attending physicians, pharmacists, medical residents, medical students, PA students and pharmacy students. The teams will round at both hospitals. The pharmacy resident will be responsible for providing pharmaceutical care to patients on their respective rotation. In addition to direct patient care respon - sibilities, the resident will gain experience in research and teaching. The resident will complete an original research project as well as a medication use evaluation (MUE). The resident will learn the fundamentals of teaching during a teaching development series. These teaching skills will be applied during the Pharmacy Practice Skills course for first-year Doctor of Pharmacy students in didactic and case discussion sessions, as well as in various other courses. The resident assists in precepting fourth-year Doctor of Pharmacy students and has opportunities for providing continuing education programs for healthcare practitioners. A teaching certificate will be awarded to residents who complete the teaching development series. Cape Fear Valley Health Cape Fear Valley Health offers a PGY1 residency program to develop knowledge and skills to provide pharmacotherapy for inpatients and outpatients through two tracks - acute care and ambulatory care, along with a community-based pharmacy PGY1 program. Cape Fear Valley's large sys - tem of clinics and hospitals serve as practice sites for a variety of clinical rotations for pharmacy residents and students including internal medicine, ambulatory care, drug information, cardiology, infectious disease, pediatrics, geriatrics, oncology, critical care, and emergency medicine.

Students will also recognize the impact of disability and dysfunction while integrating the needs of the patient/family into the plan of care.Communication Skills Students in the Campbell University DPT Program must be able communicate and comprehend the English language in written, oral, and electronic forms with faculty and classmates in academic settings along with members of health care team and patients in clinical/professional settings. Examples of communications skills may include speaking, writing, hearing, and reading. The ability to elicit information regarding mood/affect, alertness, activity, movement, function, and non-verbal behavior is essential. Sensory/Observational Skills Students in the Campbell University DPT Program must be able to observe cadaveric dissection, wounds, burns, pelvis and perineum and other potentially unsettling tasks throughout the curriculum. Students must be able to observe patients to obtain a history directly from the patient or guardian. Such observation requires use of vision, hearing, and other somatosensory modalities. Motor Skills Students in the Campbell University DPT Program must demonstrate adequate strength and endurance along with fine and gross motor skills to perform frequent lifting, twisting, bending, kneeling, pushing/ pulling necessary for patient transfers, gait, assessment, and intervention. The ability to safely assist patients with ambulatory activities and stand for prolonged periods of time is essential. Students must have sufficient manual dexterity to write, type, grasp, pinch, hold, push, pull, lift, and palpate. Students must be able to ensure patient and personal safety at all times. Students must be able to successfully per - form dissection, debridement, auscultation, percussion, and wound/burn management. Students must also be able to perform cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and use of an automated external defibrillator (AED).PHYSICAL THERAPY | 91Academic Standards Student academic performance and progress are reviewed at the midterm and completion of each semester by the program director and Academic Perfor - mance & Standards (APS) Committee. The DPT Program core faculty discuss academic and professional behavior performance of all students at the end of each academic se - mester. Students and advisors are notified by email of any academic or professional deficiencies at midterm and completion of each semester. Any discussions regarding type of academic and/or professional/ be- havioral deficiency and remedy occur with development of an action plan (if remedia - tion is required; see below for remediation process). A letter from program director will state the specifics of academic standing described in the following sections. The letter will be provided to the student via email. The letter will contain the following: Description of academic standing (remediation, probation, dismissal) Rationale for academic standing Criteria required to regain good academ - ic standing Contact information for the program director to discuss items outlined in the letter Notification of appeals process Core faculty is actively involved in pro - moting student retention through annual advisement sessions. A modified generic abilities document will be used to guide the process. Advisement can occur more fre - quently (e.g. professionalism, behavioral, or academic concerns) should the need arise. Mechanisms are in place to encourage students to seek assistance for academic performance. Retention and Promotion Criteria Full-time students enrolled in the DPT Pro - gram at the College of Pharmacy & Health Sciences (CPHS) are expected to make satisfactory academic progress toward completion of the degree requirements. Satisfactory academic progress is defined as successful completion of didactic and clin - ical education in the prescribed time and maintenance of good academic standing. Students who fail to maintain satisfactory academic progress in the professional program are automatically placed on academic probation. They may be required to participate in academic counseling, be enrolled in a remedial program of study, or dismissed according to the policies described in subsequent sections. Students, who fail to maintain good academic stand -ing at the completion of a semester prior to a semester requiring a clinical experi - ence(s), may not participate in the full-time experience(s) portion of a semester. The student would need to undergo a remedial course of study, with successful completion, prior to engaging in the experience(s) (DPT 800, 802, 804). In the event remediation is not successful, students cannot progress to the clinical experience(s). Such actions will be recommended by the Academic Performance & Standards Committee and program director, with notification to the associate dean of health sciences. The student will be notified of these actions by the program director. Students may need to take leave from the DPT Program for non-academic reasons. Re - quests for student leave will be considered and approved by the program director on a case-by-case basis (e.g. illness, financial hardship, family responsibilities, etc.). Should a student be unable to participate in classes for 2 consecutive weeks for a reason approved by the program director, disengagement from the program will be necessary. Should absence occur during clinical experience(s), see policies in Clinical Education Manual. The length of disengage - ment and any requirements for reengage - ment will be outlined in a letter from the program director along with a meeting. The length of disengagement cannot be greater than 3 consecutive semesters. The following contains a description of the types of academic standing within the DPT Program: 1. Good Academic Standing Students will be considered in good aca - demic standing providing all the following criteria are met. Maintenance of GPA requirement -Cumulative GPA of 2.8 Passing grades for all clinical education experiences No violations of student honor code or code of conduct have occurred Successful completion of required remediation No other factor meeting criteria for other category of academic standing 2. Remediation Students who fail to meet academic standards within a given course or clinical education experience will be required to remediate coursework and/or attend another clinical experience. Students will require remediation for any patient safety issue throughout the curriculum. Students must initiate remediation within 24 hours of receiving a grade of < 70% on any examination or failing grade on any OSCE or practical within a given course. Failure to initiate remediation will be considered a professional behavior violation. The content and expectation for remediation will be directed by the course instructor within a week of receiving a grade. Upon successful remediation, a grade will not be modified to > 70%. Successful remediation of an exam, OSCE, or practical must occur in the provided time and only a single attempt is allowed. In the event that remediation cannot be sched - uled and completed within the current semester, the earned grade will be assigned and student will be placed on provisional status. Remediation must be completed by the end of the following semester or the student will be placed on probation. If the student is not successful in the single remediation attempt, he/she will be placed on academic probation. Should a student fail to remediate academic performance, or there are any behavioral and/ or non- academic reasons preventing them from participating in regularly scheduled clinical experience, this must be remediated prior to progression in the program. Should a student fail a clinical experience, this experience must be remediated prior to progression in the program. Clinical experiences cannot be completed out of sequence. Clinical experiences may be repeated providing the student has adhered to all stipulations in the letter from the program director. Upon successful completion, the student will rejoin in the normal curriculum sequence and graduate, assuming all didactic courses have been completed. A student failing more than one clinical education experience will be dismissed from the program. 3. Academic Probation Academic probation is the initial action for a student failing to make satisfactory academic progress. A student will be placed on academic probation for: Failure to maintain a cumulative GPA re - quirements for good academic standing A grade of D in any single course Failure to complete any degree require - ment at the prescribed time without prior approval Failure to successfully complete required remediation in a single attempt or complete attempt within the following semester Provisional probation is assigned for students not completing required reme - diation prior to conclusion of semester92 | 2022-2023 A CAdemi C BUlletiNDepending on the nature of the academic deficiencies and overall academic record, a student placed on academic probation may or may not be permitted to continue in the regular sequence of the professional cur - riculum. Students cannot be on academic probation more than two times throughout the entirety of the program. Students who fail to complete the criteria for lifting academic probation will be considered for dismissal from the DPT Program. The DPT Academic Performance & Standards (APS) Committee and program director will review the student records each semes- ter and again at the end of the term of probation. A recommendation will be made to restore good academic standing if: 1. The student's cumulative GPA returns to 2.8 2. Successfully completed a deficient clinical education experience and recommendation for a return term/year for the program. A recommendation will be made to dismiss if while on academic probation: 1. A student makes a \"D\" or below in any course. 2. A student fails to correct academic deficiencies within the prescribed time. 4. Academic Dismissal Academic dismissal from the DPT Program and CPHS may be recommended to the associate dean for academic affairs by the program director and APS Committee if a student: Makes a F in a single course. Fails to maintain program minimum GPA requirements for > 2 semesters. Fails to make satisfactory progress during a period of academic probation. Has an academic deficiency which precludes continuation in the prescribed program of study, and may not rea - sonably be expected to complete the requirements of the degree. A student dismissed from the College may seek re-entry by applying for re-admission using the standard admissions process. Professional Behavior Concerns Professional behaviors are expected of Campbell University DPT students at all program-sponsored activities including but not limited to: classes, service activities, pro bono and migrant camp work, clinical experiences, and professional conferences. Faculty and staff are required to document unprofessional behaviors and record them in the secure electronic student file with notification sent to assigned advisor for reference. Unprofessional behaviors are assessed by faculty and the APS Committee to determine severity of violation and required follow-up action if needed. These actions can range from a meeting with the involved faculty/staff member, advisor follow-up, consultation with APS Committee, referral to program director, referral to appropriate CPHS Committee, or recommendation for dismissal. Repeated or significant unprofessional behaviors have the potential to impact didactic, service, and clinical activities required for the successful completion of the DPT Program and ultimately licensure eligibility. Faculty/ staff are encouraged to consult with the APS Committee for guidance when clarity is required. Time to Complete the Program Students have up to 150% of the total normal program length or 13 semesters to complete the DPT Program. Approved medical leave and academic deficiencies count toward the total time clock. Should a student take longer than that amount of time to complete the program, additional studies or repeating of semesters may be required to ensure competency in content knowledge and skills. Delayed Graduation Policy If a DPT student is required to re-take class - es as a result of specific course failure or a deficiency in overall academic performance, then a delay in scheduling clinical education experiences or matriculation through the curriculum will occur and the student's graduation may be delayed. Voluntary course withdrawals or a tem - porary temporary separation may cause a delay in clinical experiences, progress through the curriculum, and a subsequent delay in graduation. Any alteration in the normal curriculum progression may affect a student's financial aid status or qualifica - tion for education-based financial aid. For specific counseling and advice, students should contact the College's Office of Academic Affairs and the University's Office of Financial Aid. Graduation Requirements Recommendation for graduation requires faculty approval and attainment of the following requirements: Successful completion of all courses, requirements (IPE offerings while on campus and rural health modules), and remediation Successful completion of all clinical education experiences Attendance of graduation week activities such as advising, exit interviews, and a convocation ceremony Attendance at the graduation ceremony Good academic standing at the culmina - tion of the program Graduation after Deceleration DPT students who decelerate due to approved medical leave, and are in good academic standing, may walk at the grad - uation ceremony with their original cohort if they lack no more than six hours of credit (one clinical education experience). The missing credit must be completed no later than March 15 of the original graduation date. Students who lack more than six hours of credit will walk at the next graduation ceremony after completion of their outstanding requirements. Students who decelerate will receive their degree at the next University awarding period. These students may not sit for their FSBPT licensure examination until after the degree has been awarded. Employment while in the Program Outside employment during the DPT Program is strongly discouraged. Required program activities cannot be altered. Outside obligations cannot interfere or impede class attendance or completion of assignments and program requirements. Students must not substitute for faculty or staff by performing any administra - tive, clerical, or clinical duties while on clinical experiences. Transfer Students CPHS DPT Program does not accept transfer students directly into the program. Students currently enrolled in another DPT Program in the United States seeking admission into the Campbell DPT Program will be asked to apply. Interested individuals must follow the procedures for admission. Applicants must be in good academic stand - ing and have a letter from the dean of their institution supporting the request. These admissions decisions will be handled in the same manner as all other applicants to the College by the actions of the Admissions Committee. All prerequisites must be met prior to ma - triculation to the DPT Program at Campbell University. CPHS reserves the right to make changes in requirements for admission, curriculum, standards for progression, advancement and graduation, fees and rules and regulations.PHYSICAL THERAPY | 93To apply to the DPT Program, please follow the policies and procedures in the admissions portion of the CPHS Academic Bulletin. Grading System The following arbitrary grading scale is utilized for the DPT B, C, D, F, and W\" are included in semester hours attempted and will affect the grade point average. A student may appeal a grade per the policy in the general section of this document. An instructor or director-initiated inquiry/ request will be remediated and corrected at any time. Class Attendance Students are required to attend at least 85% of the hours prescribed for every enrolled course to receive credit for the course. Attendance is expected at all classes, labs, and examination and is part of profes - sionalism. Individual professors have the prerogative of imposing a more restrictive policy consistent with the following exceptions: Absence due to serious illness, injury, or death in the student's immediate family. In the above cases, a student may be permitted to make up work missed. It is the student's responsibility, whenever possible, to notify their instructors in advance that he or she will be absent. Exam Attendance Students are required to take each exami - nation on the day and time it is scheduled by the course coordinator. There will be no make-up examinations administered except at the discretion of the course coordinator due to valid reasons identified in the attend - ance policy in the Class Attendance section. Students must notify the course director by email within 24 hours of the examination date to request consideration of an exam reschedule. If deemed necessary,make-up examinations will be offered at a date and time that is scheduled by the course coordi - nator. The make-up examination may differ from the regularly scheduled examination. Examination rules for students are located on course syllabi.Curriculum Campbell University's DPT Program is a 36-month graduate degree program with 38 weeks of supervised clinical education experiences. Graduates will receive the Doctor of Physical Therapy degree upon successful completion. The program starts in January with graduation in December. Most didactic courses are held on the main campus with an online licensure prepara - tion course completed while on terminal clinical experience in the final year of study. The DPT Program curriculum is a compe - tency-based graduate education (minimum required skills for physical therapist education and normative model of PT education) curriculum based on a hybrid model pulling from traditional, lifespan, and problem-based learning. The sequence of courses is designed to start with foundation courses in the basic sciences, professional development, and early clinical skills. Following the initial foun - dational coursework, subsequent courses teach clinical assessment and intervention, medical, surgical and pharmacy concepts in patient management from a popula - tion-based lifespan perspective. Integrated curricular themes in service-learning and early clinical experiences, therapeutic exercise, and approach to patient care using a lifespan model is designed to enhance student learning and promote confidence in application of skills and didactic knowledge. Clinical reasoning courses are designed to enhance student interaction through problem-based learning, application of concepts/skills, and critical interpretation of evidence. The integrated service learning and clinical experiences are designed to encourage interprofessional interaction and collaboration. Assessment of students in the didactic/classroom years is by written examinations, performance on laboratory practical examinations, OSCE, reflective narrative, professional portfolio, and participation in small group activities. Three clinical experiences occur throughout the curriculum with a six- week introduc - tory clinical experience in the spring of the second year. The remaining terminal experi - ences occur in the third year with durations of 16 weeks each for a total of 38 weeks of clinical training. Students complete clinical experiences and service learning in rural locations with most completing a clinical experience in a rural location. Clinical experiences can be completed in an acute/ subacute, neuromuscular, musculoskeletal, general practice, and specialty settings. Specialized settings may include burn/ wound care, aquatic, industrial/vocational, and VA/military locations, home health, and school systems. Evaluation of students on clinical experiences includes a clinical instructor and student self-assessment of student performance using the Clinical Performance Instrument (CPI), reflective narratives on patient care experience/ de - livery, case study presentations, and written examinations to prepare for licensure. All students complete all didactic elements in the program at the same time. All students complete the required clinical experiences. The only potential elective study available in this curriculum is spring semester of the third year.

The following are Campbell PA agreed upon technical standards: All PA students must possess the intel - lectual, ethical, physical, and emotional capabilities required to undertake the full curriculum and to achieve the levels of competence required by the faculty. Because these standards describe essential functions that students must demonstrate to meet the requirements of PA education, they are prerequisites for entrance, contin - uation, promotion, and graduation from the PA program. The use of an intermediary, a person trained to perform essential skills on behalf of the student, is not permitted. The following technical standards are adapted from the Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC) guidelines. Before matriculation, accepted students must attest in writing that they have read and are able to meet the program's tech - nical standards. Candidates for admission PHYSICIAN ASSISTANT PRACTICE | 103to and graduation from the Campbell PA Program should possess the following abilities: Observation The candidate must be able to observe required demonstrations and experiments in the basic sciences, including but not limited to anatomic dissection, microscopic studies, and patient demonstrations. A candidate must be able to observe a patient accurately at a distance and close at hand. Observation necessitates the functional use of the sense of vision, hearing, and somatic sensation. Communication A candidate must be able to speak, to hear, and to observe patients in order to elicit information, describe changes in mood, ac - tivity, and posture, and perceive non-verbal communication. A candidate must be able to communicate effectively and sensitively with patients. Communication includes not only speech, but also reading and writing in English. The candidate must be able to communicate effectively and efficiently in oral and written form with all members of the health care team.

Academic Standards PA Academic Performance and Standards Committee The Academic Performance and Stand - ard Committee (APSC) of the Campbell University Physician Assistant program is comprised of the Principal Faculty, Medical Director, and Program Director. The committee meets regularly as needed to review the academic standing of each student. Prior to the end of the didactic year the APSC convenes to recommend students for advancement to the clinical year; it convenes again prior to the end of the clinical phase to recommend candidates for graduation. The committee will also be convened at any point in the program at the recommendation of a faculty member to discuss a student whose performance is at risk for not meeting standards. Retention and Promotion Criteria Students enrolled in the Physician Assistant program are expected to make satisfactory academic progress toward completion of degree requirements. Satisfactory academic progress is defined as successful completion of all required courses and com - pletion of all deficiencies and/or required remedial programs in the time and manner prescribed by the Physician Assistant pro - gram faculty. Students must also achieve and maintain a minimum cumulative GPA of 2.8 at the end of blocks 2, 4, and 5. Students who fail to maintain satisfactory academic progress will be placed on academic probation. Students on academic probation will be advised to participate in academic counseling and/or in a remedial program of study, as determined by the APSC. Assignment Completion All course assignments must be turned in by the date and time posted by the instructor. Unless specific reasons for late submissions are approved in advance by the instructor, an assignment that is more than 6 days late will not be accepted and the student will receive a zero for the assignment. Exam Protocol - Late for an Exam Students must be in their seats and have their computers set up before the posted exam time (usually on the hour). Students who are late for an exam must not enter the exam room; these students must report to the security desk. They will be set up in a lo - cation provided by faculty or other proctors who may be available. For a first offense the earned grade will be awarded. For any subsequent exam tardiness, students up to 15 minutes late will receive a 10% reduction in grade for the exam. Students more than 15 minutes late will not be allowed to take the exam. For extenuating circumstances beyond the student's control the student must notify his/her advisor or the course coordinator by email, text, or phone as soon as possible.

The following policies pertain to students who have academic difficulty. 1. Didactic Exam and Clinical Skills Remediation In the didactic curriculum, 70% is a passing score. An exam or course component failure with a grade of less than 70% in any course will result in a required remediation exercise. The grade earned on the initial exam will be the grade used to calculate the final course grade. Failure to successfully remediate an exam or course component failure will result in automatic course failure and placement on academic probation. In addition, following any exam or course component failure, the program may require any or all of the following interventions, or others, as appropriate: 1. The student may be required to meet with an Academic Success Team (which may include the Faculty Advisor, Course Coordinator, the Director of Didactic Education, and/ or Program Director) to discuss exam performance. 2. The student may be placed on academic probation. 3. The student may be required to complete a Learning Contract. Failure of a third exam in any one block or failure of four exams during the didactic year will result in automatic academic probation. 2. Didactic Course Failure and Remediation A student who receives a cumulative final grade in a course of less than 70% will initially receive a course failure and be placed on academic probation for the remainder of the Program. 1. Students must successfully remediate any course failure prior to progres - sion to subsequent blocks. Failure to successfully remediate the course in the prescribed manner and time will result in dismissal from the pro - gram. Remediation time frame and requirements are at the discretion of the course coordinator/APSC. If all remediation requirements are met and remediation of the course is completed successfully, the course grade will be advanced to 70% and the student will receive a final letter grade of C on transcript. Didactic Course Failure The student will be given one opportunity to remediate the course. Should a student receive a final cumulative grade of less than 70% in any additional course within the didactic curriculum or less than 65% within the clinical curriculum, it will not be remediable and will result in a recommendation to the APSC for dismissal from the Program. Clinical Year Remediation With maintenance of the required stand - ards, students will achieve unimpeded progression through the clinical year. The following policies pertain to students who have academic difficulty. End-of-Rotation Exam Remediation The final grade for clinical rotations is a combination of end-of-rotation (EOR) exam grades, preceptor evaluation, written assignments, and the professionalism eval - uation, as outlined in the course syllabus. Failure of any EOR exam, with a score of less than 65%, must be successfully remediated with a written exam and a remediation assignment. The grade earned on the initial EOR exam will be the grade used to calcu - late the final course grade. If a student does not successfully remediate a failed EOR exam, s/he will fail the rotation/course and be placed on academic probation. Failure of the course results in deceleration, delayed graduation, and additional tuition and fees. Students may successfully remediate one failed EOR exam, without being placed on academic probation. Failure of a second EOR exam will result in academic proba - tion and evaluation by the PA Academic Performance & Standards Committee. The committee will review each student's over- all academic performance on an individual basis to determine whether deceleration with delayed graduation is in the student's best interest. Failure of a third EOR exam will result in the student being evaluated by the PA Academ - ic Performance & Standards Committee. The committee will review the student's overall academic performance to determine whether, and under what conditions, the student may continue in the program. Preceptor Evaluation Remediation Clinical preceptor grades are an integral part of assessment of clinical year students. Clinical year students who receive a failing grade from a preceptor on any rotation may be placed on probation, after review of the situation by the Academic Performance and Standards Committee (APSC). If failure by the preceptor is upheld by the APSC, the student will receive a failure for the rotation. Students who receive a failing grade from a second preceptor evaluation will again be brought before the APSC. The APSC will evaluate the specific circumstances of each preceptor evaluation. If the APSC decides that the evaluations are evidence that the student is unprepared for the rigors of clinical practice, the student may be dismissed from the program. Professionalism Rubric Remediation If a student receives less than 70% on the professionalism rubric for any given rotation, they will be placed on academic warning and will need to meet with their academic advisor and Director of Experien - tial Education. If a student receives less than 70% on the professionalism rubric on a second rotation, they will be referred to the Academic Performance and Standards Committee. Remediation Records A record of all student remediation exercis - es will be kept in the student's file. A record of remediation for each semester is kept in a flow sheet in the program files. Program Progression Didactic Year Progression A student may not progress to the subse - quent block without successful remediation of a failed course. Failure to remediate the course successfully will result in recom - mended Program dismissal to the APSC. Advancement to the Clinical Year Advancement to the clinical year requires faculty approval and attainment of the following requirements: 1. Successful completion of all didactic year courses, 2. Maintenance of a 2.8 or greater overall GPA, 3. Successful completion of the didactic year summative evaluations, 4. Completion of required service learning hours, and 5. Participation in all required Campbell University interprofessional education (IPE) events. If a student does not meet all of the above requirements, he/she may not be allowed to progress to clinical year. The APSC will meet to review student progress. If the APSC decides that the unmet requirements are evidence that the student is unprepared for the rigors of clinical practice, the stu - dent may be dismissed from the program.PHYSICIAN ASSISTANT PRACTICE | 105Clinical Year Progression Failure of a clinical rotation with a grade of less than 70% requires repeating the rotation and the student will be placed on academic probation. Mandatory repeating of the clinical rotation will result in delay of graduation from the program. The student will incur additional tuition costs for the re - peat rotation.Second Course Failure: Should a student receive a final cumulative grade of less than 70% in any additional course within the didactic or clinical curriculum, it will not be remediable and will result in a recommendation to the APSC for dismissal from the Program. Academic Probation Academic probation is the initial action for a student failing to make satisfactory academic progress. A student will be placed on academic probation for: 1. Failure to successfully remediate an exam in which he or she received a grade of less than 70% in the didactic year or 65% in the clinical year 2. Failure of a third exam in any one block or failure of four exams during the didactic year 3. Failure of a third EOR exam in the clinical year 4. Failure of one course with a grade of less than 70% 5. Failure to maintain a cumulative GPA of 2.8 at the conclusion of blocks 2, 4, or 5 6. Failure to demonstrate appropriate professional attitudes and behaviors 7. Observed behaviors/ conduct that would preclude professional licensure. The APSC will make specific recommen - dations regarding parameters of student's academic probation. Students who are placed on Academic Probation during the didactic year will remain on Probation for a minimum of the remainder of the first year of the curriculum. Students placed on academic probation due to a course failure will remain on academic probation for the remainder of the program. Students on academic probation must comply with all requirements as directed by the APSC. Failure to meet these requirements may result in dismissal from the Program. PA Program Dismissal Students may be dismissed from the Physi - cian Assistant program for the following: 1. Failure to successfully remediate a course failure, in which the student received a grade of less than 70% (didactic)/ 65% (clinical), or 2. Failure of a course while on academic probation for a previous course failure3. Failure to maintain a 2.8 GPA at the conclusion of the didactic year. 4. Failure to meet satisfactory academic and/or professional progression in the program as determined by the APSC Students who are dismissed from the program have three (3) business days to appeal the decision to the associate dean for health sciences. The associate dean will review the case within seven (7) business days and deliver a decision. The decision of the associate dean for health sciences is final. Please see the General College Information for the acceptable appeals process. Graduation Requirements Recommendation for graduation requires faculty approval and attainment of the following requirements: 1. Successful completion of all courses, requirements, and remediation, 2. Successful completion of the Campbell PA program PANCE board review seminar, and 3. Successful completion of all summative clinical year evaluations. Graduation after Deceleration PA Students who decelerate due to probation, repeating a clinical rotation, or approved medical leave, will be able to walk at the next graduation ceremony after com - pletion of their outstanding requirements. Master of Physician Assistant Practice candidates who are on track to complete the PA program in July or August, who are in good academic standing and missing no more than fifteen (15) credit hours (in addition to remaining portion of MPAP 613, Senior Seminar) of meeting all requirements to graduate with a Master of Physician As - sistant Practice degree can file a \"Request to participate in the May Commencement.\" Students with more than fifteen (15) credit hours remaining (in addition to the MPAP 613, Senior Seminar) at the May ceremony can participate in the next University gradu - ation cycle.

Can - didates applying for this exemption must also submit an Application for Graduation through the Registrar's office. If approved, the candidate will be allowed to participate in only one Commencement program for the degree in question. Candidates participating under this special exemption will not receive a diploma or Certificate of Graduation until all program requirements have been met. They must submit a new application for graduation for the term in which the degree will actually be conferred. In addition, students participating also must understand that participating in graduation does not infer that they have met all the requirements for degree conferral. A student participating under this exemption in the May ceremony would not be eligible for certification by the NCCPA until all program requirements have been met and approved by the Office of Academic Affairs and Registrar's office. All academic, clinical, and remedial work must be completed within three years of matriculating in the PA program. Students who have outstanding work after three years may reapply for admission. Employment while in the Program 1. Outside employment during the didactic or clinical phases of the PA program is strongly discouraged. 2. Required program activities cannot be altered by outside activities. Outside obligations cannot impede class attend - ance or completion of assignments or program requirements. 3. Students are not permitted to perform any clerical, administrative, or physical work for the PA program or be employed as a graduate assistant. 4. Students must not substitute for faculty or staff by performing any administra - tive, clerical, or clinical duties while on supervised clinical educational rotations. Medical Leave-of-Absence Students who require a medical leave-of- absence must request a meeting with the program director. The circumstances of the leave will be reviewed with the Academic Performance and Standards Committee. Each case will be considered on an individual basis. A plan for deceleration, remediation, or withdrawal will be devel - oped in discussion with the associate dean for admissions and student affairs. Student withdrawal will follow the \"Withdrawal\" protocol in the general section of this bulletin. Students returning after a medical leave-of- absence must obtain a medical clearance letter prior to returning to the program. Curriculum The Campbell PA program is 24 months in length. The graduate degree program consists of 12 months of didactic education and 12 months of supervised clinical experiential education. Upon successful completion of the program, graduates will receive the Master of Physician Assistant Practice (MPAP) degree. The program starts in July, with graduation after six concurrent semesters of training.106 | 2022-2023 A CAdemi C BUlletiNAll didactic courses are held on the health sciences campus in Lillington, NC. The Campbell PA program is a competen - cy-based graduate medical education cur - riculum based on the medical model. The sequence of courses is designed to be fully integrated, vertically and horizontally. Basic foundational concepts are aligned with systems-based courses including clinical medicine, clinical skills, and pharmacothera - peutics, as well as more specialized courses such as emergency medicine and surgery. The development of critical thinking skills and hands-on competencies are integral to the curriculum. Clinical simulations and early experiential opportunities complement the curriculum throughout the didactic and clinical years. Assessment of students in the first year is by written examinations, performance on practical examinations and simulation exercises, and participation in small group activities as well as final summative exams. All students complete all didactic ele - ments in the program at the same time. All students must complete all required clinical experiences. The only elective study available in this curriculum is in the second year when students may undertake super - vised clinical experiences in two four-week rotations of their choosing. Curriculum design and operationalization is guided by the standards of accreditation for physician assistant education, as published by the Accreditation Review Commission on Education for the Physician Assistant (ARC- PA). The ARC-PA accreditation standards de - scribe the required curricular components and required supervised clinical experiences for a program to receive accreditation. The curriculum described was designed to meet these accreditation requirements. Clinical Education Clinical rotations in the second year consist of four-week supervised clerkship expe - riences in the major disciplines and two clinical electives. Evaluation of clinical-year students includes a preceptor assessment of performance, and student performance on written examinations or presentations given at the end of each required clinical rotation. There are final summative assess - ments at the conclusion of the clinical year which are required for graduation.Didactic Courses Block 1 Courses Credit Hours MPAP 531 - Anatomy & Physiology 4 MPAP 535 - Foundations of Health & Disease 1 MPAP 504 - Clinical Medicine I 3 MPAP 522 - Clinical Skills I (History & Physical) 3 MPAP 515 - Pharmacotherapeutics I 1 Total 12 Block 2 Courses Credit Hours MPAP 505 - Clinical Medicine II 3 MPAP 523 - Clinical Skills II 4 MPAP 516 - Pharmacotherapeutics II 2 MPAP 503 - Behavioral Medicine 2 MPAP 536 - Foundations of Health & Disease 1 Total 12 Block 3 Courses Credit Hours MPAP 506 - Clinical Medicine III 3 MPAP 537 - Foundations of Health & Disease 1 MPAP 519 - Health Policy 1 MPAP 517 - Pharmacotherapeutics II 1 MPAP 521 - Surgery 3 MPAP 524 - Clinical Skills III 3 Total 12 Block 4 Courses Credit Hours MPAP 526 - Clinical Medicine IV 3 MPAP 538 - Foundations of Health & Disease 1 MPAP 509 - Evidence - Based Medicine I 1 MPAP 514 - Orthopaedics 2 MPAP 527 - Pharmacotherapeutics IV 2 MPAP 525 - Clinical Skills IV 3 Total 12 Block 5 Courses Credit Hours MPAP 528 - Clinical Medicine V 4 MPAP 539 - Foundations of Health & Disease 1 MPAP 530 - Pharmacotherapeutics V 1 MPAP 510 - Emergency Medicine 3 MPAP 529 - Clinical Skills V 3 Total 12Clinical Rotations Courses Credit Hours MPAP 601 - Emergency Medicine 5 MPAP 602 - Family Practice 5 MPAP 603 - Internal Medicine 5 MPAP 604 - Surgery 5 MPAP 605 - Pediatrics 5 MPAP 606 - Psychiatry 5 MPAP 607 - Women's Health 5 MPAP 608 - Primary Care 5 MPAP 611 - Elective 1 5 MPAP 612 - Elective 2 5 MPAP 613 - Senior Seminar 5 MPAP 614 - Contextualizing Health & Healthcare 5 Clinical Affiliation There are numerous clinical affiliations for PA students to complete their supervised clinical training. Students will be notified of their clinical training sites during the spring/ summer semester of the didactic year. Clinical Rotations at Distant Sites While many clinical educational rotations are in Harnett and surrounding counties, it may be necessary for the program to arrange some rotations at distant sites. Every effort will be made to arrange clinical rotations that are within a 90 minute drive time from campus, or from a student's home, for those who are North Carolina residents. Travel expenses are the student's responsibility. Nevertheless, there are times when it may be necessary for the program to send some students to sites that are not within convenient driving distance. In those few instances, the program will attempt to arrange for suitable housing; however, students will be responsible for travel and housing costs. Students may qualify for discounted housing rates that the program may arrange if available through North Car - olina AHEC. Distant rotations will account for no more than three of any student's total rotations.

Competencies for Graduates In order to prepare for certification and professional practice as a Physician Assistant, the PA student must graduate from a competency based, entry level, and accredited PA program. The Campbell PA program consists of didactic and clinical education guided by the Standards for Physician Assistant Education as set forth by the Accreditation Review Commission on Education for the Physician Assistant (ARC-PA). This document defines the specific knowl - edge, skills, and attitudes that physician assistants (PA) in all clinical specialties and settings in the United States should be able to demonstrate throughout their careers. This set of competencies is designed to serve as a roadmap for the individual PA, for teams of clinicians, for health care systems, and other organizations commit - ted to promoting the development and maintenance of professional competencies 110 | 2022-2023 A CAdemi C BUlletiNamong PAs. While some competencies are acquired during the PA education program, others are developed and mastered as PAs progress through their careers. As PAs develop greater competency throughout their careers, they determine their level of understanding and confi - dence in addressing patients' health needs, identify knowledge and skills that they need to develop, and then work to acquire further knowledge and skills in these areas. This is a lifelong process that requires discipline, self-evaluation, and commitment to learning throughout a PA's professional career. This version of the Competencies for the Physician Assistant Profession was developed by the Cross-Org Competencies Review Task Force, which included two representatives from each of the four na - tional PA organizations. The task force was charged with reviewing the professional competencies as part of a periodic five- year review process, as well as to \"ensure alignment with the Core Competencies for New PA Graduates ,\" which were developed by the Physician Assistant Education Association in 2018 to provide a framework for accredited PA programs to standardize practice readiness for new graduates. The Campbell PA Program has adopted these competencies, with recognition that a basic level of competency is required of all graduates and that competencies will continue to be developed after graduation. The Program provides specific knowledge, skills, and educational experiences requisite for PAs to acquire and demonstrate these competencies. Knowledge for practice Demonstrate knowledge about established an evolving biomedical, clinical sciences and the application of this knowledge to patient care. Interpersonal and Communication Skills Demonstrate interpersonal and commu - nication skills that result in the effective exchange of information and collaboration with patients, their families and health professionals. Person-Centered Care Provide person centered care that includes patient and setting specific assessment, evaluation and management and health care that is evidence based, supports patient safety and advances health equity. Interprofessional collaboration Demonstrate the ability to engage with a variety of other health care professionals in a matter that optimizes safe, effective, patient and population centered care. Professionalism and Ethics Demonstrate a commitment to practicing medicine in ethically and legally appropriate ways, emphasizing professional maturity and accountability for delivering safe and quality care to patients and populations. Practice Based Learning and Quality Improvement Demonstrate the ability to learn and implement quality improvement practices by engaging in critical analysis of one's own practice experience, the medical literature and other information resources for the purposes of self-evaluation, lifelong learning and practice improvement. Society and Population Health Recognize and understand the influences of the ecosystem of person, family population and, environment and policy of health of patients and integrate knowledge of these determinants of health into patient care decisions.PUBLIC HEALTH | 111Public Health Department of Public Health Campbell University College of Pharmacy & Health Sciences Tracey F.
