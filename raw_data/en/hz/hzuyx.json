Dr. Huntoon is ready when you are. To Request an Action Plan to Address CMV - CytoMegalo Virus CMV, is a common virus that infects people of all ages. In the United States, nearly one in three children are already infected with CMV by age 5 years. Over half of adults by age 40 have been infected with CMV. Once CMV is in a person's body, it stays there for life and can reactivate. This is true from the Traditional Medical Perspective. This is not true if you apply Dr. Huntoon's Alternative Medicine Approach below. A person can also be reinfected with a different strain (variety) of the virus. Most people infected with CMV show no signs or symptoms. That's because a healthy person's Immune System usually keeps the virus from causing illness. However, CMV infection can cause serious health problems for people with weakened Immune Systems, as well as babies infected with the virus before they are born (congenital CMV). Signs and Symptoms Signs & Symptoms Most people with CMV infection have no symptoms and aren't aware that they have been infected. In some cases, infection in healthy people can cause mild illness that may include - Fever, - Sore throat, - Fatigue, and - Swollen glands. Occasionally, CMV can be associated with people who have mononucleosis or hepatitis (liver problem). People with weakened [Immune Systems](child-immune-system-health.asp) who get CMV can have more serious symptoms affecting the - eyes, - lungs, - liver, - esophagus, - stomach, and - intestines. Babies born with CMV can have - brain, - liver, - spleen, - lung, and - growth problems. - Hearing loss is the most common health problem in babies born with congenital CMV infection, which may be detected soon after birth or may develop later in childhood. Transmission and Prevention Transmission and Prevention People with CMV may shed (pass) the virus in body fluids, such as - urine, - saliva, - blood, - tears, - semen, and - breast milk. CMV is spread from an infected person in the following ways: - From direct contact with urine or saliva, especially from babies and young children - Through sexual contact - From breast milk - Through transplanted organs and blood transfusions - From mother to child during pregnancy (congenital CMV) Regular hand washing, particularly after changing diapers, is a commonly recommended step to decrease the spread of infections, and may reduce exposures to CMV. Healthcare providers should follow standard precautions. Traditional Medical Treatment Options The Medical Perspective Diagnosing CMV Blood tests can be used to diagnose CMV infections in people who have symptoms. Primary CMV infections usually go unrecognized because most people are asymptomatic or do not have specific symptoms. Primary CMV infection should be suspected if a woman - Has symptoms of infectious mononucleosis but has negative test results for [Epstein-Barr virus](epsteinbarrvirus ebv.asp), or - Shows signs of [hepatitis](hepatitis-c.asp), but has negative test results for hepatitis A, B, and C. CMV may be detected by viral culture or polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of infected blood, urine, saliva, cervical secretions, or breast milk. CMV infection is usually diagnosed using serologic testing. Serum samples collected one to three months apart can be used to diagnose primary infection. Seroconversion (1st sample IgG negative, 2nd sample IgG positive) is clear evidence for recent primary infection. However, diagnosis of CMV infection between birth and one year can be complicated by the presence of maternal CMV IgG. Risk of CMV Infection CMV infects people of all ages. In the United States; nearly one in three children are already infected with CMV by age 5 years. By 40 years, over half of adults have been infected with CMV. People who care for or work closely with young children may be at greater risk of CMV infection than other people because CMV infection is common among young children. By age 5 years, one in three children have been infected with CMV, usually from breastfeeding or contact with other young children. Although young children with CMV infection generally have no symptoms, CMV can be present in their body fluids for months after they first become infected. Regular hand washing, especially after contact with body fluids of young children, is commonly recommended to avoid spread of infections, including CMV. In the United States, nearly half of women have already been infected with CMV before their first pregnancy. Of women who have never had a CMV infection, it is estimated that 1-4% of them will have a primary infection during pregnancy. A woman who has a primary CMV infection during pregnancy is more likely to pass CMV to her fetus than a women who is reinfected or has a reactivation of the latent virus during pregnancy. However, in the United States, 50-75% of congenital CMV infections occur among infants born to mothers already infected with CMV, who either had a reinfection or a reactivation during pregnancy. Routine screening for primary CMV infection during pregnancy is not recommended in the United States. Most laboratory tests currently available cannot conclusively detect if a primary CMV infection occurred during pregnancy. This makes it difficult to counsel pregnant women about the risk to their fetuses. The lack of a proven treatment to prevent or treat infection of the fetus reduces the potential benefits of prenatal screening. - VERY LOW BIRTH WEIGHT AND PREMATURE INFANTS There are no recommendations against breastfeeding by mothers who are CMV-seropositive. However, premature infants (born <30 weeks gestational age and <1500g) who acquire CMV from breast milk may be at risk of developing a late-onset sepsis-like syndrome. The potential benefits of human milk versus the risk of CMV transmission should be considered when making a decision about breastfeeding of very low birth weight infants (birth weight <1500 g) by mothers known to be CMV-seropositive. Freezing and pasteurization of breast milk can decrease the risk of transmission; however, freezing does not eliminate the risk of transmission. Treatment Healthy people who are infected with CMV usually do not require medical treatment. Medications are available to treat CMV infection in people who have weakened immune systems and babies who show symptoms of congenital CMV infection.
