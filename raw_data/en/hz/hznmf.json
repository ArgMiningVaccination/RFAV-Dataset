The Chakras are energy centres within the body that help to regulate all its processes, from organ function to the immune system and emotions. These energy centres can become blocked & out of balance manifesting in physical, emotional and mental dis-ease leading to disruption in your well-being. Humans are made up of water, oxygen, and other minerals and elements. These elements are similar to those found in crystals. When we are feeling balanced and in good health our energy and vibration levels are high. However, at times circumstances in life can lead to imbalance and poor health. The energetic properties of Crystals resonate with the energy centres within the body, and assist in self-healing on all levels, therefore restoring balance. Crystals and minerals have been used in some form and in ancient cultures throughout the ages, for: healing; energy enhancement; and spiritual development. Their properties became known particularly for the ability to store, focus and transmit a very constant frequency of energy vibration. Quartz crystals can even be found in watches and clocks as they help them to keep accurate time due to their unique vibrations. What happens during Crystal Therapy? You remain fully clothed; you need only remove your shoes and watch (the vibrations in the watch may interfere with the treatment). The treatment is usually performed with you laying on your back on a treatment table. However, this can be adapted to a seated position if preferred. Crystals are placed on and around your body. You may feel very relaxed and experience a number of sensations as the crystals get to work on restoring balance to your energy field. Each treatment is different and if you do not experience any sensations, it does not mean the treatment has not worked or been ineffective. Who is it for? Adults and children aged 5 years and above due to having to stay still during the treatment. (Children below the age of 17 years must be accompanied by a parent, guardian or responsible adult who will remain present throughout the treatment). Parent or Guardian's consent is required prior to treatment commencing. How may Crystal Therapy benefit me? Instilling a feeling of calmness and peace. Supporting the relief of physical, mental, emotional and spiritual disorders. Help to settle an overactive mind leading to clarity and focus. Relieve stress, anxiety and tension. "}
