The company believes its innovative needle-free technology will be fundamental to help the world in rethinking what's possible with vaccines. Vaxxas' approach which has been validated in human clinical studies can enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of a vaccine's immune response. The company uses proprietary dry-coating technology that can eliminate or significantly reduce the need for vaccine refrigeration during storage and transportation - easing the resource and logistics burden of maintaining the vaccine \"cold chain\". Vaxxas is targeting initial applications in infectious disease and oncology and has forged collaborations with leading global organizations in vaccine commercialization, including Merck/MSD, the United States Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), the World Health Organization (WHO), and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.
