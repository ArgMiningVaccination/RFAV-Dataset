Acupuncture uses needles placed along invisible meridians that run throughout the body. Today, acupuncturists also use lasers, magnets and electric pulses in addition to needles. Each meridian point has a specific meaning and can unblock and repair meridians and channels with vital energy or chi. Through the stimulation of the meridians, an acupuncturist is able to restore balance and ergo health to the patient. Vital Energy and Acupuncture Points: The art of acupuncture has taken thousands of years to develop and test. Many patients compliment acupuncture with other therapies such as chiropractic care, massage, physical therapy and more. This Chinese therapy is all natural and allows the body to repair itself with help from stimulating specific acupoints. Acupuncturists believe in the importance of vital energy and it is this energy which helps to restore the energetic balance in the body. When this balance is disturbed, patients are likely to feel sick or have pain. The Overall Condition of the Patient: Acupuncture involves more than just the obvious symptoms of a patient. Acupuncturists evaluate all of the five senses: the manner in which the patient speaks, what he or she talks about, Chinese pulses and they also take into account factors that may not necessarily be considered by Western medicine doctors. Many times, our physical pain comes as a result of an emotional imbalance rather than an actual injury or illness. Acupuncture is now a widely accepted form of treatment especially for back and neck pain. Dr Viviana Viera, DAOM, practices with us on Mondays and Thursdays. Call our office at 706-557-0211 to "}
