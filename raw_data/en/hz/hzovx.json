This edition supersedes any previously released draft or final profile. Toxicological profiles are revised and republished as necessary, but no less than once every three years. For information regarding the update status of previously released profiles, contact ATSDR at: Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry Division of Toxicology/Toxicology Information Branch 1600 Clifton Road NE, E-29 Atlanta, Georgia 30333.MERCURY vii QUICK REFERENCE FOR HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS Toxicological Profiles are a unique compilation of toxicological information on a given hazardous substance. Each profile reflects a comprehensive a nd extensive evaluation, summary, and interpretation of available toxicologic and epidemiologic informati on on a substance. Health care providers treating patients potentially exposed to hazardous substances will find the following information helpful for fast answers to often-asked questions. Primary Chapters/Sections of Interest Chapter 1: Public Health Statement : The Public Health Statement can be a useful tool for educating patients about possible exposure to a hazardous subs tance. It explains a substance's relevant toxicologic properties in a nontechnical, question-and-answer format, and it includes a review ofthe general health effects observed following exposure. Chapter 2: Health Effects : Specific health effects of a given hazardous compound are reported by route of exposure , by type of health effect (death, systemic, immunologic, reproductive), and by length of exposure (acute, intermediate, and chronic). In addition, both human and animal studies are reported in this section. NOTE: Not all health effects reported in this section are necessarily observed in the clinical setting. Please refer to th e Public Health Statement to identify general health effects observed following exposure. Pediatrics: Four new sections have been added to each Toxicological Profile to address child health issues: Section 1.6 How Can (Chemical X) Affect Children? Section 1.7 How Can Families Reduce the Risk of Exposure to (Chemical X)? Section 2.6 Children's SusceptibilitySection 5.6 Exposures of Children Other Sections of Interest: Section 2.7 Biomarkers of Exposure and EffectSection 2.10 Methods for Reducing Toxic Effects ATSDR Information Center Phone: 1-800-447-1544 (to be replaced 404-639-6359 E-mail: atsdric@cdc.gov The be or dered through the ATSDR Information Center: Case Studies in Environmental Medicine: Taking an Exposure History \u2014The importance of taking an exposure history and how to conduct one are d escribed, and an example of a thorough exposure history is provided. Other case studies of interest include Reproductive and Developmental Hazards; Skin Lesions and Environmental Ex posures; Cholinesterase-Inhibiting Pesticide Toxicity; and numerous chemical-specific case studies.MERCURY viii Managing Hazardous Materials Incidents is a three-volume set of recommendations for on-scene (prehospital) and hospital medical management of patients exposed during a hazardous materials incident. Volumes I and II are planning guides to assist fi rst responders and hospita l emergency department personnel in planning for incidents that involve hazardous materials. Volume III\u2014 Medical Management Guidelines for Acute Chemical Exposures \u2014is a guide for health care professionals treating patients exposed to hazardous materials.

Health Effects Review. The Health Eff ects Review Committee examines the health effects chapter of each profile for consistency and accuracy in interpreting health effects and classifying end points. 2. Minimal Risk Level Review. The Minimal Ri sk Level Workgroup considers issues relevant to substance-specific minimal risk levels (MRLs) , reviews the health effects database of each profile, and makes recommendations for derivation of MRLs. 3. Data Needs Review. The Research Implementa tion Branch reviews data needs sections to assure consistency across profiles and adheren ce to instructions in the Guidance..MERCURY xi PEER REVIEW A peer review panel was assembled for mercury. The panel consisted of the following members: 1. Mr. Harvey Clewell, K.S. Crump Group, IC F Kaiser International, Inc., Ruston, LA 2.

PUBLIC HEALTH STATEMENT This public health statement tells you about mercury and the effects of exposure. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) identifies the most serious hazardous waste sites in the nation. These sites make up the National Priorities List (NPL) and are the sites targeted forlong-term federal cleanup activities. Mercury has been found in at least 714 of the 1,467 currentor former NPL sites. However, the total number of NPL sites evaluated for this substance is notknown. As more sites are evaluated, the sites at which mercury is found may increase. Thisinformation is important because exposure to this substance may harm you and because thesesites may be sources of exposure. When a substance is released from a large area, such as an industrial plant, or from a container, such as a drum or bottle, it enters the environment. This release does not always lead toexposure. You are exposed to a substance only when you come in contact with it. You may beexposed by breathing, eating, or drinking the substance or by skin contact. If you are exposed to mercury, many factors determine whether you'll be harmed. These factors include the dose (how much), the duration (how long), and how you come in contact with it. You must also consider the other chemicals to which you're exposed, as well as your age, sex,diet, family traits, lifestyle, and state of health. 1.1 WHAT IS MERCURY? Mercury occurs naturally in the environment and exists in several forms. These forms can be organized under three headings: metallic mercury (also known as elemental mercury), inorganicmercury, and organic mercury. Metallic mercury is a shiny, silver-white metal that is a liquid atroom temperature. Metallic mercury is the elemental or pure form of mercury (i.e., it is notcombined with other elements). Metallic mercury metal is the familiar liquid metal used inthermometers and some electrical switches. At room temperature, some of the metallic mercury MERCURY 2 1. PUBLIC HEALTH STATEMENT will evaporate and form mercury vapors. Mercury vapors are colorless and odorless. The higher the temperature, the more vapors will be released from liquid metallic mercury. Some people whohave breathed mercury vapors report a metallic taste in their mouths. Metallic mercury has beenfound at 714 hazardous waste sites nationwide. Inorganic mercury compounds occur when mercury combines with elements such as chlorine, sulfur, or oxygen. These mercury compounds are also called mercury salts. Most inorganicmercury compounds are white powders or crystals, except for mercuric sulfide (also known ascinnabar) which is red and turns black after exposure to light. When mercury combines with carbon, the compounds formed are called \"organic\" mercury compounds or organomercurials. There is a potentially large number of organic mercurycompounds; however, by far the most common organic mercury compound in the environment ismethylmercury (also known as monomethylmercury). In the past, an organic mercury compoundcalled phenylmercury was used in some commercial products. Another organic mercurycompound called dimethylmercury is also used in small amounts as a reference standard for somechemical tests. Dimethylmercury is the only organic mercury compound that has been identifiedat hazardous waste sites. It was only found in extremely small amounts at two hazardous wastesites nationwide, but it is very harmful to people and animals. Like the inorganic mercurycompounds, both methylmercury and phenylmercury exist as \"salts\" (for example, methylmercuricchloride or phenylmercuric acetate). When pure, most forms of methylmercury andphenylmercury are white crystalline solids. Dimethylmercury, however, is a colorless liquid. Several forms of mercury occur naturally in the environment. The most common natural forms of mercury found in the environment are metallic mercury, mercuric sulfide (cinnabar ore), mercuricchloride, and methylmercury. Some microorganisms (bacteria and fungi) and natural processescan change the mercury in the environment from one form to another. The most common organicmercury compound that microorganisms and natural processes generate from other forms ismethylmercury. Methylmercury is of particular concern because it can build up in certain edible MERCURY 3 1. PUBLIC HEALTH STATEMENT freshwater and saltwater fish and marine mammals to levels that are many times greater than levels in the surrounding water (see Section 1.2). Mercury is mined as cinnabar ore, which contains mercuric sulfide. The metallic form is refined from mercuric sulfide ore by heating the ore to temperatures above 1,000 degrees Fahrenheit. Thisvaporizes the mercury in the ore, and the vapors are then captured and cooled to form the liquidmetal mercury. There are many different uses for liquid metallic mercury. It is used in producingof chlorine gas and caustic soda, and in extracting gold from ore or articles that contain gold. It is also used in thermometers, barometers, batteries, and electrical switches. Silver-colored dentalfillings typically contain about 50% metallic mercury. Metallic mercury is still used in someherbal or religious remedies in Latin America and Asia, and in rituals or spiritual practices in someLatin American and Caribbean religions such as Voodoo, Santeria, and Espiritismo. These usesmay pose a health risk from exposure to mercury both for the user and for others who may beexposed to mercury vapors in contaminated air. Some inorganic mercury compounds are used as f ungicides. Inorganic mercury, including ammoniated been Mercuric chloride is a topical antiseptic or disinfectant agent. In the past, mercurous chloride waswidely used in medicinal products including laxatives, worming medications, and teethingpowders. It has since been replaced by safer and more effective agents. Other chemicalscontaining mercury are still used as antibacterials. These products include mercurochrome(contains a small amount of mercury, 2%), and thimerosal and phenylmercuric nitrate, which areused in small amounts as preservatives in some prescription and over-the-counter medicines. Mercuric sulfide and mercuric oxide may be used to color paints, and mercuric sulfide is one of thered coloring agents used in tattoo dyes. Methylmercury is produced primarily by microorganisms (bacteria and fungi) in the environment, rather than by human activity. Until the 1970s, methylmercury and ethylmercury compounds wereused to protect seed grains from fungal infections. Once the adverse health effects ofmethylmercury were known, the use of methymercury- and ethylmercury as fungicides wasMERCURY 4 1. PUBLIC HEALTH STATEMENT banned. Up until 1991, phenylmercuric compounds were used as antifungal agents in both interior and exterior paints, but this use was also banned because mercury vapors were released from thesepaints. Chapter 3 contains more information on the physical and chemical properties of mercury. Chapter 4 contains more information on the production and use of mercury. 1.2 WHAT HAPPENS TO MERCURY WHEN IT ENTERS THE ENVIRONMENT? Mercury is a naturally occurring metal found throughout the environment. Mercury enters the environment as the result of the normal breakdown of minerals in rocks and soil from exposure towind and water, and from volcanic activity. Mercury releases from natural sources have remainedrelatively constant in recent history, resulting in a steady rise in environmental mercury. Humanactivities since the start of the industrial age (e.g., mining, burning of fossil fuels) have resulted inadditional release of mercury to the environment. Estimates of the total annual mercury releasesthat result from human activities range from one-third to two-thirds of the total mercury releases. A major uncertainty in these estimates is the amount of mercury that is released from water andsoils that were previously contaminated by human activities as opposed to new natural releases. The levels of mercury in the atmosphere (i.e., the air you breathe in the general environment) arevery, very low and do not pose a health risk; however, the steady release of mercury has resultedin current levels that are three to six times higher than the estimated levels in the preindustrial eraatmosphere. Approximately 80% of the mercury released from human activities is elemental mercury released to the air, primarily from fossil fuel combustion, mining, and smelting, and from solid wasteincineration. About 15% of the total is released to the soil from fertilizers, fungicides, andmunicipal solid waste (for example, from wast e that contains discarded batteries, electrical switches, or thermometers). An additional 5% is released from industrial wastewater to water inthe environment.MERCURY 5 1. PUBLIC HEALTH STATEMENT With the exception of mercury ore deposits, the amount of mercury that naturally exists in any one place is usually very low. In contrast, the amount of mercury that may be found in soil at aparticular hazardous waste site because of human activity can be high (over 200,000 times naturallevels). The mercury in air, water, and soil at hazardous waste sites may come from both naturalsources and human activity. Most of the mercury found in the environment is in the form of metallic mercury and inorganic mercury compounds. Metallic and inorganic mercury enters the air from mining deposits of oresthat contain mercury, from the emissions of coal -fired power plants, from burning municipal and medical waste, from the production of cement, and from uncontrolled releases in factories that use mercury. Metallic mercury is a liquid at room temperature, but some of the metal will evaporateinto the air and can be carried long distances. In air, the mercury vapor can be changed into otherforms of mercury, and can be further transported to water or soil in rain or snow. Inorganicmercury may also enter water or soil from the weathering of rocks that contain mercury, fromfactories or water treatment facilities that release water contaminated with mercury, and fromincineration of municipal garbage that contains mercury (for example, in thermometers, electricalswitches, or batteries that have been thrown away). Inorganic or organic compounds of mercurymay be released to the water or soil if mercury-containing fungicides are used. Microorganisms (bacteria, phytoplankton in the o cean, and fungi) convert inorganic mercury to methylmercury. Methylmercury released from microorganisms can enter the water or soil andremain there for a long time, particularly if the methylmercury becomes attached to small particlesin the soil or water. Mercury usually stays on the surface of sediments or soil and does not movethrough the soil to underground water. If mercury enters the water in any form, it is likely to settleto the bottom where it can remain for a long time. Mercury can enter and accumulate in the food chain. The form of mercury that accumulates in the food chain is methylmercury. Inorganic mercury does not accumulate up the food chain to anyextent. When small fish eat the methylmercury in food, it goes into their tissues. When larger fisheat smaller fish or other organisms that cont ain methylmercury, most of the methylmercuryMERCURY 6 1. PUBLIC HEALTH STATEMENT originally present in the small fish will then be stored in the bodies of the larger fish. As a result, the larger and older fish living in contaminated waters build up the highest amounts of methyl-mercury in their bodies. Saltwater fish (especially sharks and swordfish) that live a long time andcan grow to a very large size tend to have the highest levels of mercury in their bodies. Plants(such as corn, wheat, and peas) have very low levels of mercury, even if grown in soils containingmercury at significantly higher than background levels. Mushrooms, however, can accumulatehigh levels if grown in contaminated soils. For further information on what happens to mercury inthe environment, see Chapters 4 and 5. 1.3 HOW MIGHT I BE EXPOSED TO MERCURY? Because mercury occurs naturally in the environment, everyone is exposed to very low levels of mercury in air, water, and food. Between 10 and 20 nanograms of mercury per cubic meter(ng/m 3) of air have been measured in urban outdoor air. These levels are hundreds of times lower than levels still considered to be \"safe\" to breathe. Background levels in nonurban settings areeven lower, generally about 6 ng/m 3 or less. Mercury levels in surface water are generally less than 5 parts of mercury per trillion parts of water (5 ppt, or 5 ng per liter of water), about athousand times lower than \"safe\" drinking water standards. Normal soil levels range from 20 to625 parts of mercury per billion parts of soil (20-625 ppb; or 20,000-625,000 ng per kilogram ofsoil). A part per billion is one thousand times bigger than a part per trillion. A potential source of exposure to metallic mercury for the general population is mercury released from dental amalgam fillings. An amalgam is a mixture of metals. The amalgam used in silver-colored dental fillings contains approximately 50% metallic mercury, 35% silver, 9% tin, 6%copper, and trace amounts of zinc. When the amalgam is first mixed, it is a soft paste which isinserted into the tooth surface. It hardens within 30 minutes. Once the amalgam is hard, themercury is bound within the amalgam, but very small amounts are slowly released from thesurface of the filling due to corrosion or chewing or grinding motions. Part of the mercury at the surface of the filling may enter the air as mercury va por or be dissolved in the saliva. The total amount of mercury released from dental amalgam depends upon the total number of fillings andMERCURY 7 1. PUBLIC HEALTH STATEMENT surface areas of each filling, the chewing and ea ting habits of the person, and other chemical conditions in the mouth. Estimates of the amount of mercury released from dental amalgamsrange from 3 to 17 micrograms per day (\u00b5g/day). The mercury from dental amalgam maycontribute from 0 to more than 75% of your total daily mercury exposure, depending on thenumber of amalgam fillings you have, the amount of fish consumed, the levels of mercury (mostlyas methylmercury) in those fish, and exposure from other less common sources such as mercuryspills, religious practices, or herbal remedies that contain mercury. However, it should be kept inmind that exposure to very small amounts of mercury, such as that from dental amalgam fillings,does not necessarily pose a health risk. Whether the levels of exposure to mercury vapor from dental amalgam are sufficiently high to cause adverse health effects, and exactly what those effects are, continues to be researched anddebated by scientists and health officials. U.S. government summaries on the effects of dentalamalgam conclude that there is no apparent health hazard to the general population, but thatfurther study is needed to determine the possibility of more subtle behavioral or immune systemeffects, and to determine the levels of exposure that may lead to adverse effects in sensitivepopulations. Sensitive populations may include pregnant women, children under the age of 6(especially up to the age of 3), people with impaired kidney function, and people withhypersensitive immune responses to metals. If you belong to this group, you should discuss yourmedical condition with your dentist prior to any dental restoration work. Removal of dentalamalgams in people who have no indication of a dverse effects is not recommended and can put the person at greater risk, if performed improperly. Chelation therapy (used to remove metals from the body tissues) itself presents some health risks, and should be considered only when a licensedoccupational or environmental health physician determines it necessary to reduce immediate andsignificant health risks due to high levels of mercury in the body. For additional information onhealth risks associated with mercury dental amalgam, see Section 2.5, \"More on the Health Effectsof Dental Amalgam.\" Some religions have practices that may include the use of metallic mercury. Examples of these religions include Santeria (a Cuban-based religion whose followers worship both African deitiesMERCURY 8 1. PUBLIC HEALTH STATEMENT and Catholic saints), Voodoo (a Haitian-based set of beliefs and rituals), Palo Mayombe (a secret form of ancestor worship practiced mainly in the Caribbean), and Espiritismo (a spiritual beliefsystem native to Puerto Rico). Not all people who observe these religions use mercury, but whenmercury is used in religious, ethnic, or ritualistic practices, exposure to mercury may occur both atthe time of the practice and afterwards from contaminated indoor air. Metallic mercury is soldunder the name \"azogue\" (pronounced ah-SEW-gay) in stores called \"botanicas.\" Botanicas arecommon in Hispanic and Haitian communities, where azogue may be sold as an herbal remedy orfor spiritual practices. The metallic mercury is often sold in capsules or in glass containers. Itmay be placed in a sealed pouch to be worn on a necklace or in a pocket, or it may be sprinkled inthe home or car. Some people may mix azogue in bath water or perfume, or place azogue indevotional candles. Because metallic mercury evaporates into the air, these practices may putanyone breathing the air in the room at risk of exposure to mercury. The longer people breathe thecontaminated air, the greater their risk will be. The use of metallic mercury in a home or anapartment not only threatens the health of the people who live there now, but also threatens the health of future residents who may unknowingly be exposed to further release of mercury vapors from contaminated floors or walls. Metallic mercury is used in a variety of household products and industrial items, including thermostats, fluorescent light bulbs, barometers, glass thermometers, and some blood pressuredevices. The mercury in these devices is contained in glass or metal, and generally does not pose arisk unless the item is damaged or broken, and mercury vapors are released. Spills of metallicmercury from broken thermometers or damaged electrical switches in the home may result inexposure to mercury vapors in indoor air. You must be careful when you handle and dispose of all items in the home that contain metallic mercury. Very small amounts of metallic mercury (for example, a few drops) can raise air concentrations of mercury to levels that may be harmful to health. The longer people breathe the contaminated air,the greater the risk to their health. Metallic mercury and its vapors are extremely difficult toremove from clothes, furniture, carpet, floors, walls, and other such items. If these items are notMERCURY 9 1. PUBLIC HEALTH STATEMENT properly cleaned, the mercury can remain for months or years, and continue to be a source of exposure. It is possible for you to be exposed to metallic mercury vapors from breathing contaminated air around hazardous waste sites, waste incinerators, or power plants that burn mercury-containing fuels (such as coal or other fossil fuels), but mo st outdoor air is not likely to contain levels that would be harmful. Exposure to mercury compounds at hazardous waste sites is much more likelyto occur from handling contaminated soil (i.e., children playing in or eating contaminated surfacesoil), drinking well-water, or eating fish from c ontaminated waters near those sites. Not all hazardous sites contain mercury, and not all waste sites that do contain mercury have releases ofmercury to the air, water, or surface soils. You can be exposed to mercury vapors from the use of fungicides that contain mercury. Excess use of these products may result in higher-than-average exposures. You may also be exposed tomercury from swallowing or applying to your skin outdated medicinal products (laxatives, worming medications, and teething powders) that contain mercurous chloride. Exposure may also occur from the improper or excessive use of other chemicals containing mercury, such as skin-lightening creams and some topical antiseptic or disinfectant agents (mercurochrome andthimerosal). Workers are mostly exposed from breathing air that contains mercury vapors, but may also be exposed to other inorganic mercury compounds in the workplace. Occupations that have a greater potential for mercury exposure include manufacturers of electrical equipment orautomotive parts that contain mercury, chemical processing plants that use mercury, metalprocessing, construction where building part s contain mercury (e.g., electrical switches, thermometers), and the medical professions (medical, dental, or other health services) whereequipment may contain mercury (e.g., some devices that measure blood pressure contain liquid mercury). Dentists and their assistants may be exposed to metallic mercury from breathing inmercury vapor released from amalgam fillings and to a much lesser extent from skin contact with MERCURY 10 1. PUBLIC HEALTH STATEMENT amalgam restorations. Family members of workers who have been exposed to mercury may also be exposed to mercury if the worker's clothes are contaminated with mercury particles or liquid. Some people may be exposed to higher levels of mercury in the form of methylmercury if they have a diet high in fish, shellfish, or marine mammals (whales, seals, dolphins, and walruses) thatcome from mercury-contaminated waters. Methylmercury accumulates up the food chain, so thatfish at the top of the food chain will have the most mercury in their flesh. Of these fish, the largest(i.e., the oldest) fish will have the highest levels. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) estimates that most people are exposed, on average, to about 50 ng of mercury per kilogram ofbody weight per day (50 ng/kg/day) in the food they eat. This is about 3.5 micrograms (\u00b5g) ofmercury per day for an adult of average weight. This level is not thought to result in any harmfuleffects. A large part of this mercury is in the form of methylmercury and probably comes fromeating fish. Commercial fish sold through interstate commerce that are found to have levels ofmethylmercury above an \"action level\" of 1 ppm (established by the FDA) cannot be sold to thepublic. This level itself is below a level associated with adverse effects. However, if you fish incontaminated waters and eat the fish you catch, you may be exposed to higher levels of mercury. Public health advisories are issued by state and federal authorities for local waters that are thoughtto be contaminated with mercury. These advisories can help noncommercial (sport andsubsistence) fishermen and their families to avoid eating fish contaminated with mercury. Foodsother than fish that may contain higher than average levels of mercury include wild game, such aswild birds and mammals (bear) that eat large amounts of contaminated fish. People in the mostnorthern climates may be exposed to high levels of mercury from eating meat or fat from marinemammals including whales, dolphins, walruses, and seals. These marine mammals are at or nearthe top of their marine food chain. Plants contain very little methylmercury or other forms ofmercury. Mushrooms grown in mercury-contaminated soil may contain levels of mercury thatcould pose some risk to health, if large amounts were eaten. See Chapter 5 for more information on how you might be exposed to mercury.MERCURY 11 1. PUBLIC HEALTH STATEMENT 1.4 HOW CAN MERCURY ENTER AND LEAVE MY BODY? A person can be exposed to mercury from breat hing in contaminated air, from swallowing or eating contaminated water or food, or from having skin contact with mercury. Not all forms ofmercury easily enter your body, even if they come in contact with it; so it is important to knowwhich form of mercury you have been exposed to, and by which route (air, food, or skin). When you swallow small amounts of metallic mercury, for example, from a broken oral thermometer, virtually none (less than 0.01%) of the mercury will enter your body through thestomach or intestines, unless they are diseased. Even when a larger amount of metal mercury (ahalf of a tablespoon, about 204 grams) was swallowed by one person, very little entered the body. When you breathe in mercury vapors, however, most (about 80%) of the mercury enters yourbloodstream directly from your lungs, and then rapidly goes to other parts of your body, including the brain and kidneys. Once in your body, metallic mercury can stay for weeks or months. Whenmetallic mercury enters the brain, it is readily converted to an inorganic form and is \"trapped\" inthe brain for a long time. Metallic mercury in the blood of a pregnant woman can enter herdeveloping child. Most of the metallic mercury will accumulate in your kidneys, but somemetallic mercury can also accumulate in the brain. Most of the metallic mercury absorbed into thebody eventually leaves in the urine and feces, while smaller amounts leave the body in the exhaledbreath. Inorganic mercury compounds like mercurous chloride and mercuric chloride are white powders and do not generally vaporize at room temperatures like elemental mercury will. If they areinhaled, they are not expected to enter your body as easily as inhaled metallic mercury vapor. When inorganic mercury compounds are swallowed, generally less than 10% is absorbed throughthe intestinal tract; however, up to 40% may enter the body through the stomach and intestines insome instances. Some inorganic mercury can enter your body through the skin, but only a smallamount will pass through your skin compared to the amount that gets into your body fromswallowing inorganic mercury. MERCURY 12 1. PUBLIC HEALTH STATEMENT Once inorganic mercury enters the body and gets into the bloodstream, it moves to many different tissues. Inorganic mercury leaves your body in the urine or feces over a period of several weeks ormonths. A small amount of the inorganic mercury can be changed in your body to metallicmercury and leave in the breath as a mercury vapor. Inorganic mercury accumulates mostly in thekidneys and does not enter the brain as easily as metallic mercury. Inorganic mercury compoundsalso do not move as easily from the blood of a pregnant woman to her developing child. In anursing woman, some of the inorganic mercury in her body will pass into her breast milk. Methylmercury is the form of mercury most easily absorbed through the gastrointestinal tract (about 95% absorbed). After you eat fish or other foods that are contaminated with methylmercury, the methylmercury enters your bloodstream easily and goes rapidly to other parts of your body. Only small amounts of methylmercury enter the bloodstream directly through the skin, but otherforms of organic mercury (in particular dimet hylmercury) can rapidly enter the body through the skin. Organic mercury compounds may evaporate slowly at room temperature and may enter yourbody easily if you breathe in the vapors. Once organic mercury is in the bloodstream, it moveseasily to most tissues and readily enters the brain. Methylmercury that is in the blood of apregnant woman will easily move into the blood of the developing child and then into the child'sbrain and other tissues. Like metallic mercury, methylmercury can be changed by your body toinorganic mercury. When this happens in the brain, the mercury can remain there for a long time. When methylmercury does leave your body after you have been exposed, it leaves slowly over aperiod of several months, mostly as inorganic mercury in the feces. As with inorganic mercury,some of the methylmercury in a nursing woman's body will pass into her breast milk. For more information on how mercury can enter and leave your body, please see Chapter 2. 1.5 HOW CAN MERCURY AFFECT MY HEALTH? The nervous system is very sensitive to mercury. In poisoning incidents that occurred in other countries, some people who ate fish contaminated with large amounts of methylmercury or seed grains treated with methylmercury or other organic mercury compounds developed permanentMERCURY 13 1. PUBLIC HEALTH STATEMENT damage to the brain and kidneys. Permanent damage to the brain has also been shown to occur from exposure to sufficiently high levels of me tallic mercury. Whether exposure to inorganic mercury results in brain or nerve damage is not as certain, since it does not easily pass from theblood into the brain. Metallic mercury vapors or organic mercury may affect many different areas of the brain and their associated functions, resulting in a variety of symptoms. These include personality changes(irritability, shyness, nervousness), tremors, changes in vision (constriction (or narrowing) of thevisual field), deafness, muscle incoordination, loss of sensation, and difficulties with memory. Different forms of mercury have different effect s on the nervous system, because they do not all move through the body in the same way. When metallic mercury vapors are inhaled, they readilyenter the bloodstream and are carried throughout the body and can move into the brain. Breathingin or swallowing large amounts of methylmercury also results in some of the mercury moving intothe brain and affecting the nervous system. Inorganic mercury salts, such as mercuric chloride, donot enter the brain as readily as methylmercury or metallic mercury vapor. The kidneys are also sensitive to the effects of mercury, because mercury accumulates in the kidneys and causes higher exposures to these tissues, and thus more damage. All forms ofmercury can cause kidney damage if large enough amounts enter the body. If the damage causedby the mercury is not too great, the kidneys are likely to recover once the body clears itself of thecontamination. Short-term exposure (hours) to high levels of metallic mercury vapor in the air can damage the lining of the mouth and irritate the lungs and airways, causing tightness of the breath, a burning sensation in the lungs, and coughing. Other e ffects from exposure to mercury vapor include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, increases in blood pressure or heart rate, skin rashes, and eye irritation. Damage to the lining of the mouth and lungs can also occur from exposure to lower levels ofmercury vapor over longer periods (for example, in some occupations where workers wereexposed to mercury for many years). Levels of metallic mercury in workplace air are generally much greater than the levels normally encountered by the general population. CurrentMERCURY 14 1. PUBLIC HEALTH STATEMENT levels of mercury in workplace air are low, due to increased awareness of mercury's toxic effects. Because of the reduction in the allowable amount of mercury in workplace air, fewer workers areexpected to have symptoms of mercury toxicity. Most studies of humans who breathed metallicmercury for a long time indicate that mercury from this type of exposure does not affect the abilityto have children. Studies in workers exposed to metallic mercury vapors have also not shown anymercury-related increase in cancer. Skin contact with metallic mercury has been shown to causean allergic reaction (skin rashes) in some people. In addition to effects on the kidneys, inorganic mercury can damage the stomach and intestines, producing symptoms of nausea, diarrhea, or severe ulcers if swallowed in large amounts. Effects on the heart have also been observed in children after they accidentally swallowed mercuricchloride. Symptoms included rapid heart rate and increased blood pressure. There is littleinformation on the effects in humans from long-term, low-level exposure to inorganic mercury. To protect the public from the harmful effects of toxic chemicals and to find ways to treat people who have been harmed, scientists use many tests. One way to see if a chemical will hurt people is to learn how the chemical is absorbed, used, and released by the body; for some chemicals, animal testing may be necessary. Animal testing mayalso be used to identify health effects such as cancer or birth defects. Without laboratory animals, scientists would lose a basic method to get information needed to make wise decisions to protectpublic health. Scientists have the responsibility to treat research animals with care andcompassion. Laws today protect the welfare of research animals, and scientists must comply withstrict animal care guidelines. Studies using animals indicate that long-term or al exposure to inorganic mercury salts causes kidney damage, effects on blood pressure and hear t rate, and effects on the stomach. Study results also suggest that reactions involving the immune system may occur in sensitive populations afterswallowing inorganic mercury salts. Some animal studies report that nervous system damageoccurs after long-term exposure to high levels of inorganic mercury. Short-term, high-MERCURY 15 1. PUBLIC HEALTH STATEMENT level exposure of laboratory animals to inorganic mercury has been shown to affect the developing fetus and may cause termination of the pregnancy. Animals exposed orally to long-term, high levels of methylmercury or phenylmercury in laboratory studies experienced damage to the kidneys, stomach, and large intestine; changes inblood pressure and heart rate; adverse effects on the developing fetus, sperm, and malereproductive organs; and increases in the number of spontaneous abortions and stillbirths. Adverse effects on the nervous system of animals occur at lower doses than do harmful effects tomost other systems of the body. This difference indicates that the nervous system is moresensitive to methylmercury toxicity than are other organs in the body. Animal studies also provideevidence of damage to the nervous system from exposure to methylmercury during development,and evidence suggests that the effects worsen with age, even after the exposure stops. Some rat and mice strains that are susceptible to autoimmune responses develop kidney damage as a result of an immune response when exposed to relatively low levels of mercury vapor or mercurychloride. Animals given inorganic mercury salts by mouth for most of their lifetime had increases in some kinds of tumors at the highest dose tested. Rats and mice that received organic mercury (methyl- mercury or phenylmercury) in their drinking water or feed for most of their lives had an increasedincidence of cancer of the kidney, but this affected only the males that received the highest amountof mercury given (not the females). Since the high doses caused severe damage to the kidneysprior to the cancer, these animal studies provide only limited information about whether mercurycauses cancer in humans. As a result, the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) andthe International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) have not classified mercury as to itshuman carcinogenicity. The Environmental Protection Agency has determined that mercurychloride and methylmercury are possible human carcinogens. Chapter 2 contains moreinformation on the health effects of mercury in humans and animals.MERCURY 16 1. PUBLIC HEALTH STATEMENT 1.6 HOW CAN MERCURY AFFECT CHILDREN? This section discusses potential health effects fr om exposures during the period from conception to maturity at 18 years of age in humans. Potential effects on children resulting from exposures ofthe parents are also considered. Children are at risk of being exposed to metallic mercury that is not safely contained, to mercury that may be brought home on work clothes or tool s, or to methylmercury-contaminated foods. Methylmercury eaten or swallowed by a pregnant woman or metallic mercury that enters her bodyfrom breathing contaminated air can also pass in to the developing child. Inorganic mercury and methylmercury can also pass from a mother's body into breast milk and into a nursing infant. Theamount of mercury in the milk will vary, depending on the degree of exposure and the amount ofmercury that enter the nursing woman's body. There are significant benefits to breast feeding, soany concern that a nursing woman may have about mercury levels in her breast milk should bediscussed with her doctor. Methylmercury can also accumulate in an unborn baby's blood to aconcentration higher than the concentration in the mother. For similar exposure routes and forms of mercury, the harmful health effects seen in children are similar to the effects seen in adults. High exposure to mercury vapor causes lung, stomach, andintestinal damage and death due to respiratory failure in severe cases. These effects are similar tothose seen in adult groups exposed to inhaled metallic mercury vapors at work. Children who had been exposed to excessive amounts of mercurous chloride tablets for worms or mercurous chloride-containing powders for teething discomfort had increased heart rates andelevated blood pressure. Abnormal heart rhythms we re also seen in children who had eaten grains contaminated with very high levels of methylmercury. Other symptoms of poisonings in children who were treated with mercurous chloride for constipation, worms, or teething discomfort included swollen red gums, excessive salivation,weight loss, diarrhea and/or abdominal pain, and muscle twitching or cramping in the legs and/or arms. Kidney damage is very common after exposure to toxic levels of inorganic mercury. MERCURY 17 1. PUBLIC HEALTH STATEMENT Metallic mercury or methylmercury that enters the body can also be converted to inorganic mercury and result in kidney damage. Children who breathe metallic/elemental mercury va pors, eat foods or other substances containing phenylmercury or inorganic mercury salts, or use mercury-containing skin ointments for an extended period may develop a disorder known as acrodynia, or pink disease. Acrodynia can result in severe leg cramps; irritability; and abnormal redness of the skin, followed by peeling ofthe hands, nose, and soles of the feet. Itching, swelling, fever, fast heart rate, elevated bloodpressure, excessive salivation or sweating, rashes, fretfulness, sleeplessness, and/or weakness may also be present. It was once believed that this syndrome occurred only in children, but recentreported cases in teenagers and adults have shown that they can also develop acrodynia. In critical periods of development before they are born, and in the early months after birth, children and fetuses are particularly sensitive to the harmful effects of metallic mercury andmethylmercury on the nervous system. Harmful developmental effects may occur when apregnant woman is exposed to metallic mercury and some of the mercury is transferred into herdeveloping child. Thus, women who are normally exposed to mercury vapors in the workplace(such as those working in thermometer/barometer or fluorescent light manufacturing or the chlor-alkali industry) should take measures to avoi d mercury vapor exposures during pregnancy. Exposures to mercury vapors are relatively rare outside of the workplace, unless metallic mercuryis present in the home. As with mercury vapors, exposure to methylmercury is more dangerous for young children than for adults, because more methylmercury easily passes into the developing brain of young childrenand may interfere with the development process. Methylmercury is the form of mercury most commonly associated with a risk for developmental effects. Exposure can come from foods contamin ated with mercury on the surface (for example, from seed grain treated with methylmercury to k ill fungus) or from foods that contain toxic levels of methylmercury (as in some fish, wild game, and marine mammals). Mothers who are exposedto methylmercury and breast-feed their infant may also expose the child through the milk. TheMERCURY 18 1. PUBLIC HEALTH STATEMENT effects on the infant may be subtle or more pronounced, depending on the amount to which the fetus or young child was exposed. In cases in which the exposure was very small, some effectsmight not be apparent, such as small decreases in IQ or effects on the brain that may only bedetermined by the use of very sensitive neuropsychological testing. In instances in which theexposure is great, the effects may be more serious. In some such cases of mercury exposureinvolving serious exposure to the developing fetus, the effects are delayed. In such cases, theinfant may be born apparently normal, but later show effects that may range from the infant beingslower to reach developmental milestones, such as the age of first walking and talking, to moresevere effects including brain damage with mental retardation, incoordination, and inability tomove. Other severe effects observed in children whose mothers were exposed to very toxic levelsof mercury during pregnancy include eventual blindness, involuntary muscle contractions and seizures, muscle weakness, and inability to speak. It is important to remember, however, that theseverity of these effects depends upon the level of mercury exposure and the time of exposure. The very severe effects just mentioned were reported in large-scale poisoning instances in whichpregnant and nursing women were exposed to extremely high levels of methylmercury in contaminated grain used to make bread (in Iraq) or seafood (in Japan) sold to the generalpopulation. Researchers are currently studying the potential for less serious developmental effects, including effects on a child's behavior and ability to learn, think, and solve problems that may result fromeating lower levels of methylmercury in foods. A main source of exposure to methylmercury for the pregnant woman and the young child is from eating fish. Most fish purchased in the market inthe United States do not have mercury levels that pose a risk to anyone, including pregnantwomen. Since mercury accumulates in the muscles of fish, larger fish that feed on smaller fish andlive for long periods usually have larger concentrations of methylmercury than fish that feed onplants. For example, shark and swordfish normally contain the highest levels of mercury out of all ocean fish. Scientists have an ongoing debate about the value of fish in the diet versus any riskfrom increased exposure of pregnant women to methylmercury that may be in the fish. The safetyof most fish sold commercially in the United States is regulated by the FDA. These fish pose nohealth risk to those who purchase and eat them. Only fish or wildlife containing relatively highMERCURY 19 1. PUBLIC HEALTH STATEMENT levels of methylmercury are of concern, and these are discussed in Section 1.7 of this toxicological profile. 1.7 HOW CAN FAMILIES REDUCE THE RISK OF EXPOSURE TO MERCURY? If your doctor finds that you have been exposed to significant amounts of mercury, ask whether your children might also be exposed. Your doctor might need to ask your state health departmentto investigate. Children may be exposed to metallic mercury if they play with it. Metallic mercury is a heavy, shiny, silver liquid. When metallic mercury is spilled, it forms little balls or beads. Children aresometimes exposed to metallic mercury when they find it in abandoned warehouses or closedfactories, and then play with it or pass it around to friends. Children have also taken metallicmercury from school chemistry and physics labs. Broken thermometers and some electricalswitches are other sources of metallic mercury. Sometimes children find containers of metallicmercury that were improperly disposed of, or adults may bring home metallic mercury from work,not knowing that it is dangerous. To protect your children from metallic mercury, teach them not to play with shiny, silver liquids. Schoolteachers (particularly science teachers) and school staff need to know about students' fascination with metallic mercury. Teachers and school staff should teach children about thedangers of getting sick from playing with mercury, and they should keep metallic mercury in asafe and secured area (such as a closed container in a locked storage room) so that children do nothave access to it without the supervision of a teacher. Metallic mercury evaporates slowly, and ifit is not stored in a closed container, children may breathe toxic mercury vapors. In the past, mercurous chloride was widely used in medicinal products such as laxatives, worming medications, and teething powders. These older medicines should be properly disposed of and replaced with safer and more effective medicines. Other chemicals containing mercury, such asmercurochrome and thimerosal (sold as Merthiolate and other brands), are still used as antisepticsor as preservatives in eye drops, eye ointments, nasal sprays, and vaccines. Some skin-lighteningMERCURY 20 1. PUBLIC HEALTH STATEMENT creams contain ammoniated mercuric chloride and mercuric iodide. These and all other mercury- containing medicines should be kept safely out of the reach of children to prevent an accidental poisoning. Nonmedicinal products, including so me fungicides that contain mercury compounds and paints that contain mercuric sulfide or mercur ic oxide, should also be safely stored out of the reach of children. You should check to see if any medicines or herbal remedies that you or your child use contain mercury. Some traditional Chinese and Indian remedies for stomach disorders (for example,herbal balls) contain mercury, and if you give these remedies to your children, you may harmthem. If you are pregnant or nursing a baby a nd you use mercury-containing ethnic or herbal remedies, you could pass some of the mercury to your unborn child or nursing infant. If you use metallic mercury or azogue in religious practices, you may expose your children or unborn child to mercury or contaminate your home. Such practices in which mercury containingsubstances have traditionally been used include Santeria (a Cuban-based religion whose followersworship both African deities and Catholic saints), Voodoo (a Haitian-based set of beliefs andrituals), Palo Mayombe (a secret form of ancestor worship practiced mainly in the Caribbean), orEspiritismo (a spiritual belief system native to Puerto Rico). Metallic mercury is used in a variety of household products and industrial items, including thermostats, fluorescent light bulbs, barometers, glass thermometers, and some blood pressuremeasuring devices. You must be careful when you handle and dispose of all items in the homethat contain metallic mercury. If small amounts of mercury are spilled, be very careful cleaning it up. Do not try to vacuum spilled metallic mercury. Using a vacuum cleaner to clean up the mercury causes the mercury toevaporate into the air, creating greater health risks. Trying to vacuum spilled metallic mercuryalso contaminates the vacuum cleaner. Also, take care not to step on the mercury and track it intoother areas of the home. Metallic mercury vapors are very toxic and have no odor. Do not remainunnecessarily in that room, and try not to let me tallic mercury contact your eyes, skin, or clothing. If you think you have been exposed directly to metallic mercury, wash yourself MERCURY 21 1. PUBLIC HEALTH STATEMENT thoroughly and discard contaminated clothing by placi ng them in a sealed plastic bag. Perhaps the most important thing to remember if you break a household thermometer is do not panic. Theamount of mercury contained in an oral thermometer is small and does not present an immediatethreat to human health. However, if it is not properly cleaned up and disposed of, it may present ahealth risk over time, particularly to infants, toddlers, and pregnant women. If a thermometer breaks on a counter top or uncarpeted floor, remove children from the area. Mercury is not absorbent, so do not try to wipe or blot it up with a cloth or paper towel ; that will only spread the mercury and break it up into smaller beads, making it more difficult to find andremove. Instead, clean up the beads of metallic mercury by using one sheet of paper to carefullyroll them onto a second sheet of paper, or by sucking very small beads of mercury into an eyedropper. After picking up the metallic mercury in this manner, put it into a plastic bag or airtightcontainer. The paper and eye dropper should also be bagged in a zip-lock plastic container. Allplastic bags used in the cleanup should then be taken outside of the house or apartment anddisposed of properly, according to instructions provided by your local health department or environmental officials. Try to ventilate the room with outside air, and close the room off from therest of the home. Use fans (that direct the air to the outside and away from the inside of the house)for a minimum of one hour to speed the ventilation. If a thermometer breaks and the liquid/metallic mercury spills onto a carpeted floor, try to collect the mercury beads in the manner described in the above paragraph. Depending on the cut or pileof the carpeting, however, it may not be possible to collect all of the spilled mercury. Regardless,do not vacuum . Instead, call your local (county, city, or state) health department and tell them of your situation. (You may also call the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry[ATSDR] toll-free at 1-888-42-ATSDR [1-888-422-8737] to obtain additional guidance, if local assistance cannot be obtained.) If larger amounts of metallic mercury are found (for example, a jar of liquid mercury), it should be contained in an airtight container, and you should call your local health department for instructions on how to safely dispose of it. If the mercury is in an open container or the container does nothave a lid, place a piece of plastic wrap around the top of the container to prevent MERCURY 22 1. PUBLIC HEALTH STATEMENT vapors from escaping; then wash your hands thor oughly. If a larger amount is spilled, leave the area and contact your local health department and fire department. Do not simply throw metallic mercury away, but instead seek professional help. ATSDR and EPA strongly recommend against the use of metallic (liquid) mercury that is not properly enclosed in glass, as it is in thermometers. This form of mercury should not be used orstored in homes, automobiles, day-care centers, schools, offices, or other public buildings. If younotice a child with metallic mercury on his or her clothing, skin, or hair, call the fire departmentand let them know that the child needs to be decontaminated. Metallic or inorganic mercury can be carried into the home from a workers' contaminated clothing and shoes. Increased exposure to mercury has been reported in children of workers who areexposed to mercury at work, and increased levels of mercury were measured in places where workclothes were stored and in some washing machines. The children most likely to be exposed torisky levels of mercury are those whose parents work in facilities that use mercury (for example, ascientific glassware manufacturing plant or a chlo r-alkali chemical plant), but where no protective uniforms or footgear are used. In some reported cases in which children were exposed in this way,protective clothing was used in the workplace by th e parent, but work gloves, clothes, and boots, which were contaminated with mercury, were taken home, thus exposing family members. If youhave questions or concerns about exposure to mercury at work, you have a right to obtain information from your employer about your safety and health on the job without fear ofpunishment. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) requires employers to provide Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDSs) for many of the chemicals used at the workplace. Information on these sheets should include chemical names and hazardous ingredients, importantproperties (such as fire and explosion data), potential health effects, how you get the chemical(s) inyour body, how to properly handle the materials, and what to do in an emergency. Youroccupational health and safety officer at work can and should tell you whether chemicals you workwith are dangerous and likely to be carried hom e on your clothes, body, or tools, and whether you should be showering and changing clothes before you leave work, storing your street clothes in a separate area of the workplace, or laundering your work clothes at home separately from other clothes. MERCURY 23 1. PUBLIC HEALTH STATEMENT Your employer is legally responsible for provi ding a safe workplace and should freely answer your questions about hazardous chemicals. Your OS HA-approved state occupational safety and health program or OSHA can also answer any further questions you might have, and help your employer identify and correct problems with hazardous substances. If you would like to make a formalcomplaint about health hazards in your workpl ace, your OSHA-approved state occupational safety and health program or OSHA office will listen to your complaint and inspect your workplace whennecessary. One way in which people are routinely exposed to extremely small amounts of mercury is through the gradual (but extremely slow) wearing-away process of dental amalgam fillings, which contain approximately 50% mercury. The amount of mercury to which a person might be exposed fromdental amalgams would depend on the number of amalgams present and other factors. TheCenters for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has determined that dental amalgam fillings donot pose a health risk, although they do account for some mercury exposure to those having suchfillings. People who frequently grind their teeth or often chew gum can add to the small amount ofmercury normally released from those fillings over time. If you are pregnant, the decision ofwhether to have dental amalgam or a nonmercury material used for fillings, or whether existingamalgam fillings should be repaired or replaced during pregnancy, should be made in consultation with your dentist. The practice of having all your dental amalgam fillings replaced with non-mercury filling materials just to remove the possibility of mercury exposure is not recommendedby ATSDR. In fact, the removal of the merc ury amalgam fillings would actually expose the patient to a greater amount of mercury for a while. Other sources of mercury may increase youroverall exposure, such as the amount of fish consumed per week, especially if caught in localwaters contaminated with mercury or of certain species known to be higher in mercury content(shark and swordfish), or an exposure to mercury from a nearby hazardous waste site orincinerator. You or your children may be exposed to methylme rcury when eating certain types of fish caught from contaminated waters, or when eating certain types of wildlife from mercury contaminatedareas. Most states, Native American tribes, and U. S. Territories have issued fish and/or wildlife advisories to warn people about methylmercury cont aminated fish and/or wildlife. Most of theMERCURY 24 1. PUBLIC HEALTH STATEMENT methylmercury advisories relate to specific types of freshwater or saltwater fish or shellfish, or freshwater turtles. Each state, Native American tribe, or U.S. Territory sets its own criteria for issuing fish and wildlife advisories. A fish or wildlife advisory will specify which bodies of water or hunting areas have restrictions. The advisory will tell you what types and sizes of fish or game are of concern. The advisory may completely ban eating fish or tell you to limit your meals of acertain type of fish. For example, an advisory may tell you to eat a certain type of fish no morethan once a month; or an advisory may tell you only to eat certain parts of fish or game, or how toprepare it to decrease your exposure to methylmercury. The fish or wildlife advisory may bestricter to protect pregnant women, nursing wo men, and young children. To reduce your children's exposure to methylmercury, you should follow the instructions recommended in the fish orwildlife advisories. Information on Fish and Wildlife Advisories in your state is available fromyour state public health or natural resources department. Signs may also be posted in certainfishing and hunting areas with information about contaminated fish or wildlife. FDA currently advises that pregnant women and women of childbearing age who may become pregnant limit their consumption of shark and swordfish to no more that one meal per month. Thisadvice is given because methylmercury levels are relatively high in these fish species. Women ofchildbearing age are included in this advice becau se dietary practices immediately before the pregnancy could have a direct bearing on fetal exposure during pregnancy, particularly during the earlier months of pregnancy. FDA further advises that persons other than pr egnant women and women of childbearing age in the general population limit their regular consumption of shark and swordfish (which typicallycontains methylmercury around 1 ppm) to about 7 ounces per week (about one serving) to staybelow the acceptable daily intake for methylmercury. For fish species with methylmercury levelsaveraging 0.5 ppm, regular consumption should be limited to 14 ounces per week. Recreationaland subsistence fishers who eat larger amounts of fish than the general population and routinelyfish the same waterbodies may have a higher exposure to methylmercury if these waters arecontaminated. People who consume greater than 100 grams of fish (approximately 3.5 ounces)every day are considered high-end consumers. This is over 10 times more than the amount of fishconsumed by members of the general population (6.5 g/day). No consumption advice is necessaryMERCURY 25 1. PUBLIC HEALTH STATEMENT for the top ten seafood species that make up about 80% of the seafood sold in the United States: canned tuna, shrimp, pollock, salmon, cod, catfish, clams, flatfish, crabs, and scallops. The methylmercury in these species is generally less than 0.2 ppm, and few people eat more than thesuggested weekly limit of fish (i.e., 2.2 pounds). If you are concerned about a mercury exposure or think that you or your child are experiencing the adverse effects of mercury, you should consult with a doctor or public health official who isfamiliar with the health effects of mercury. 1.8 IS THERE A MEDICAL TEST TO DETERMINE WHETHER I HAVE BEEN EXPOSED TO MERCURY? There are reliable and accurate ways to measure mercury levels in the body. These tests all involve taking blood, urine, or hair samples, and must be performed in a doctor's office or in a health clinic. Nursing women may have their breast milk tested for mercury levels, if any of theother samples tested are found to contain significant amounts of mercury. Most of these tests,however, do not determine the form of mercury to which you were exposed. Mercury levels foundin blood, urine, breast milk, or hair may be used to determine if adverse health effects are likely tooccur (see Section 2.5). Mercury in urine is used to test for exposure to metallic mercury vaporand to inorganic forms of mercury. Measurement of mercury in whole blood or scalp hair is usedto monitor exposure to methylmercury. Urine is not useful for determining whether exposure hasoccurred to methylmercury. Levels found in blood, urine, and hair may be used together to predictpossible health effects that may be caused by the different forms of mercury. Blood and urine levels are used as markers to determine whether someone has been exposed to mercury. They are used to determine whether exposure to mercury has occurred and to give arough idea of the extent of exposure, but they do not tell exactly how much exposure has occurred. Except for methylmercury exposures, blood is considered useful if samples are taken within a few days of exposure. This is because most forms of mercury in the blood decrease by one-halfevery three days if exposure has been stopped. Thus, mercury levels in the blood provide MERCURY 26 1. PUBLIC HEALTH STATEMENT more useful information after recent exposures than after long-term exposures. Several months after an exposure, mercury levels in the blood and urine are much lower. Hair, which isconsidered useful only for exposures to methylmercury, can be used to show exposures thatoccurred many months ago, or even more than a year ago if the hair is long enough and carefultesting methods are used. After short-term exposures to metallic mercury, mercury vapor can bedetected in the breath, but this occurs to a significant extent only within a few days after exposure,and is not a method normally used to determine if mercury exposure has occurred. For moreinformation on testing for mercury levels in the body, see Chapters 2 and 6. 1.9 WHAT RECOMMENDATIONS HAS THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT MADE TO PROTECT HUMAN HEALTH? The federal government develops regulations and recommendations to protect public health. Regulations can be enforced by law. Federal agencies that develop regulations for toxic substances include the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the Occupational Safety andHealth Administration (OSHA), and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Recommendations , on the other hand, provide valuable guidelines to protect public health, but cannot be enforced by law. Federal organizations that develop recommendations for toxic substances include the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) and theNational Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH). Regulations and recommendations can be expressed in not-to-exceed levels in air, water, soil, or food that are usually based on levels that affect animals; then they are adjusted to help protectpeople. Sometimes these not-to-exceed levels differ among federal organizations because ofdifferent exposure times (an 8-hour workday or a 24- hour day), the use of different animal studies, or other factors. Recommendations and regulations are also periodically updated as more information becomes available. For the most current information, check with the federal agency or organization thatprovides it for the substance in which you are interested. Some regulations and recommendationsfor mercury include the following:MERCURY 27 1. PUBLIC HEALTH STATEMENT EPA and FDA have set a limit of 2 parts inorganic mercury per billion (ppb) parts of water in drinking water. EPA is in the process of revising the Water Quality Criteria for mercury. EPAcurrently recommends that the level of inorganic mercury in rivers, lakes, and streams be no morethan 144 parts mercury per trillion (ppt) parts of water to protect human health (1 ppt is a thousandtimes less than 1 part per billion, or ppb). EPA has determined that a daily exposure (for an adultof average weight) to inorganic mercury in dri nking water at a level up to 2 ppb is not likely to cause any significant adverse health effects. FDA has set a maximum permissible level of 1 partof methylmercury in a million parts (ppm) of seafood products sold through interstate commerce(1 ppm is a thousand times more than 1 ppb). FDA may seize shipments of fish and shellfishcontaining more than 1 ppm of methylmercury, a nd may seize treated seed grain containing more than 1 ppm of mercury. OSHA regulates levels of mercury in the workplace. It has set limits of 0.1 milligrams of mercury per cubic meter of air (mg/m 3)for organic mercury and 0.05 mg/m3 for metallic mercury vapor in workplace air to protect workers during an 8- hour shift and a 40-hour work week. NIOSH recommends that the amount of metallic mercury vapor in workplace air be limited to an averagelevel of 0.05 mg/m 3 during a 10-hour work shift. 1.10 WHERE CAN I GET MORE INFORMATION?

HEALTH EFFECTS 2.1 INTRODUCTION The primary purpose of this chapter is to provide public health officials, physicians, toxicologists, and other interested individuals and groups with an overall perspective of the toxicology of mercury. It contains descriptions and evaluations of toxicological studi es and epidemiological investigations and provides conclusions, where possible, on the relevance of t oxicity and toxicokinetic data to public health. A glossary and list of acronyms, abbreviations, and sy mbols can be found at the end of this profile. Mercury is a metal element that occurs naturally in the environment. Metallic or elemental mercury (Hg0) is the main form of mercury released into the air by natural processes. Mercury bound to other chemicals may have valence states of either +1 (Hg+1) or +2 (Hg+2). Mercury with a valence state of +1 is referred to as mercurous mercury, and mercury with a valence stat e of +2 is referred to as mercuric mercury. Many inorganic and organic compounds of mercury can be formed from the mercuric (divalent) cation (Hg+2). For information on the physical and chemical properties of mercury, refer to Chapter 3. There are many similarities in the toxic effects of the various forms of mercury, but there are also significant differences. In the text, tables, and figures of this profile, the metallic mercury and the inorganic salts, are organized under the general heading of inorganic mercury. The organic mercury compounds including methyl- mercuric chloride, dimethylmercury, and phenylmer curic acetate are addressed in this document under the heading of organic mercury. In most discussion in the text, the specific effects are attributable to a particular form, and the form is specified. The general population is most commonly exposed to mercury primarily from two sources: (1) eating fish and marine mammals (e.g., whales, seals) that may cont ain some methylmercury in their tissues or (2) from the release of elemental mercury from the dental amalgam used in fillings. It is not known how much of theelemental mercury released from dental amalgam is i nhaled as a mercury vapor, how much is breathed out, how much is swallowed in a liquid form, or how much is converted into a mercuric salt that is either swallowed of directly absorbed into the oral mu cosa. Exposure to mercury, however, does not necessarily mean that adverse health effects will result. Hea lth effects depend upon the amount of exposure, the form MERCURY 30 2. HEALTH EFFECTS of mercury, and the route of exposure. Each form and route leads to different effects, and these are discussed in detail in this chapter. The levels of mercury that the general population are exposed to from either fish or dental amalgam are discussed in Ch apter 5. Hazard assessments combine the information in Chapter 5 on exposure levels with the dose-response info rmation in this chapter to develop an estimate of the potential for adverse health effects from any given exposure. In the environment, inorganic mercury can be methyl ated by microorganisms to methylmercury. Methyl- mercury will accumulate in the tissues of organisms. The animals at the top of the food chain tend to accumulate the most methylmercury in their bodies. Any source of mercury release to the environment may, therefore, lead to increased levels of me thylmercury in tissues of large fish and mammals. Occupational exposures are primarily to metallic mercur y vapor. Accidental exposures to mercury are more common than accidental exposures to many hazardous substances, because liquid mercury is shiny and interesting, and because liquid mercury has been u sed in many electrical and mechanical devices. Accidental exposures, even to small amounts of me rcury, may be harmful. Liquid mercury is poorly absorbed by the skin and from the intestines, but vapors that are released from liquid mercury are readily absorbed through the lungs and are very harmful when inhaled. The text in this chapter provides considerable detail on a number of accidental exposures to all forms of mercury. This information is intended to inform the reader and help prevent accidental exposures in the future. The literature on the health effects of mercury is ex tensive. However, the human and animal data are generally limited to inhalation expos ure to metallic mercury vapors and oral exposure to inorganic and organic mercury compounds. There is limited derm al exposure information on adverse effects from ointments and creams that contain inorganic mercury compounds. Once absorbed, metallic and inorganic mercury enter an oxidation-reduction cycle. Metallic mercury is oxidized to the divalent inorganic cation in the red blood cells and lungs of humans and animals. Evidence from animal studies suggests that the liver is an additi onal site of oxidation. Absorbed divalent cation from exposure to mercuric compounds can, in turn, be redu ced to the metallic or monovalent form and released as exhaled metallic mercury vapor. In the presence of protein sulfhydryl groups, mercurous mercury (Hg+) disproportionates to one divalent cation and one molecule at the zero oxidation state (Hg0). The conversion of methylmercury or phenylmercury into divalent inorganic mercury can probably occur soon after absorption, also feeding into the oxidation-reduction pathway.MERCURY 31 2. HEALTH EFFECTS This profile contains a discussion of acrodynia under Rele vance to Public Health (Section 2.5). Acrodynia is an idiosyncratic hypersensitivity response from e xposure to mercury and is characterized by certain cardiovascular, dermal, and neurological effects, among ot hers. In the section on health effects by route of exposure, the relevant symptoms are discussed under th e appropriate headings without reference to the syndrome. This occurs, in part, because there is some overlap between symptoms characteristic of acrodynia and those seen in persons who are not hyper sensitive and, in part, because not every report of a study in which the symptoms were observed states wh ether the authors considered the affected person to have suffered from acrodynia. This profile also contains a general discussion of the human exposures to mercury associated with dental amalgam. This discussion is at the end of the Releva nce to Public Health Section 2.5, under the heading More on Health Effects and Dental Amalgam. 2.2 DISCUSSION OF HEALTH EFFECTS BY ROUTE OF EXPOSURE To help public health professionals and others a ddress the needs of persons living or working near hazardous waste sites, the information in this section is organized first by route of exposure \u2014 inhalation, oral, and dermal; and then by health effect \u2014 d eath, systemic, immunological, neurological, reproductive, developmental, genotoxic, and carcinogenic effects. These data are discussed in terms of three exposure periods \u2014 acute (14 days or less), intermediate (15-364 days), and chronic (365 days or more). Levels of significant exposure (LSE) for each route a nd duration are presented in Tables 2-1, 2-2, and 2-3 and illustrated in Figures 2-1, 2-2, and 2-3. The points in the figures showing no-observed-adverse-effect levels (NOAELs) or lowest-observed-adverse-effect levels (LOAELs) reflect the actual doses (levels of exposure) used in the studies. LOAELs have been classified into \"less serious\" or \"serious\" effects. \"Serious\" effects are those that evoke failure in a bi ological system and can lead to morbidity or mortality (e.g., acute respiratory distress or death). \"Less seri ous\" effects are those that are not expected to cause significant dysfunction or death, or those whose significance to the organism is not entirely clear. ATSDR acknowledges that a considerable amount of judgment may be required in establishing whether an end point should be classified as a NOAEL, \"less serious\" LOAEL, or \"serious\" LOAEL, and that in some cases, there will be insufficient data to decide whether the e ffect is indicative of significant dysfunction. However, the Agency has established guidelines and policies that are used to classify these end-points. ATSDR believes that there is sufficient merit in this approach to warrant an attempt at distinguishing between \"less MERCURY 32 2. HEALTH EFFECTS serious\" and \"serious\" effects. The distinction be tween \"less serious\" effects and \"serious\" effects is considered to be important because it helps the users of the profiles to identify levels of exposure at which major health effects start to appear. LOAELs or NOAELs should also help in determining whether or not the effects vary with dose and/or duration, and pl ace into perspective the po ssible significance of these effects to human health. The significance of the exposure levels shown in the Level of Significant Exposure (LSE) tables and figures may differ depending on the user's perspective. P ublic health officials and others concerned with appropriate actions to take at hazardous waste sites may want information on levels of exposure associated with more subtle effects in humans or animals (LOAELs) or exposure levels below which no adverse effects (NOAELs) have been observed. Estimates of levels posing minimal risk to humans (Minimal Risk Levels or MRLs) may be of interest to health professionals and citizens alike. Levels of exposure associated with carcinogenic eff ects (Cancer Effect Levels, CELs) of mercury are indicated in Tables 2-2 and 2-3 and Figures 2-2 and 2- 3. Cancer effects could occur at lower exposure levels; however, a range for the upper bound of estimat ed excess risks (ranging from a risk of 1 in 10,000 to 1 in 10,000,000 [10-4 to 10-7]) has not been developed by EPA. Estimates of human Minimal Risk Levels (or MRLs) have been made for mercury. An MRL is defined as an estimate of daily human exposure to a substance th at is likely to be without an appreciable risk of adverse effects (noncarcinogenic) over a specified dur ation of exposure. Although the term, MRL, may seem to imply a slight level of risk, MRLs are, in fact , considered to represent safe levels of exposure for all populations, including sensitive subgroups. MRLs are de rived when reliable and sufficient data exist to identify the target organ(s) of effect or the most sen sitive health effect(s) for a specific duration within a given route of exposure. MRLs are based on non cancerous health effects only and do not consider carcinogenic effects. MRLs can be derived for acu te, intermediate, and chronic duration exposures for inhalation and oral routes. Appropr iate methodology does not exist to develop MRLs for dermal exposure. Although methods have been established to derive these levels (Barnes and Dourson 1988; EPA 1990a), uncertainties are associated with these techniques. Furthermore, ATSDR acknowledges additional uncertainties inherent in the application of the pro cedures to derive less than lifetime MRLs. As an example, acute inhalation MRLs may not be protective for health effects that are delayed in development or are acquired following repeated acute insults, such as hypersensitivity reactions, asthma, or chronic MERCURY 33 2. HEALTH EFFECTS bronchitis. As these kinds of health effects data become available and methods to assess levels of significant human exposure improve, these MRLs may be revised. 2.2.1 Inhalation Exposure Most of the studies on inhalation exposure concern exposur e to metallic mercury vapor. For this reason, the term \"metallic mercury\" will be used in this sec tion instead of \"inorganic mercury.\" Other forms of inorganic mercury do not pose a risk by the inhalation pathway. Inhalation of sufficient levels of metallic mercury vapor has been associated with systemic toxi city in both humans and animals. The major target organs of metallic mercury-induced toxicity are th e kidneys and the central nervous system. At high- exposure levels, respiratory, cardiovascular, and gastroin testinal effects also occur. Some metallic mercury vapor may condense (Milne et al. 1970), or in the case of vapors from dental amalgam, may dissolve insaliva and be ingested (WHO 1991). Condensed droplets are more likely to be ingested than inhaled (resulting in a lower absorbed dose than would be exp ected for a given concentration in air). Mercury vapor concentrations in the general work environm ent may also be lower than those in the micro- environment immediately surrounding workers (Bell et al. 1973; Stopford et al. 1978); therefore, estimatesof air mercury values in occupational studies should be carefully evaluated for bias towards a level that may be lower than actual exposure levels. No studies were located concerning effect levels following inhalation exposure to inorganic salts of mercury (e.g., mercuric or mercurous salts, oxides). Also, much of the information located regarding effects of metallic mercury vapors or volatile organic compounds (VOCs) comes from studies with significant limitations. Information on inhalation e xposure to organic mercury compounds (e.g., alkyl mercury compounds) in humans is limited to case repor ts and includes only qualitative data on gastro- intestinal, renal, muscular, and neurological effects. In many cases, it is difficult to determine whether effects observed in exposed persons were directly attr ibutable to mercury exposure. In addition, a great deal of the information on effects associated with inhalation exposure to metallic mercury vapor comes from studies conducted several decades ago, when met hods for determining exposure levels were less precise than current methods.MERCURY 34 2.

Several studies have reported death in humans following accidental acute-duration exposure to high, but unspecified, concentrations of metallic mercury vapor (Campbell 1948; Kanluen and Gottlieb 1991; Matthes et 1992; Teng and Brennan 1959; Tennant et al. 1961). Death in all cases was attributed to respiratory failure. In all of these cases, high levels of mercury vapors were generate d by volatilizing metallic mercury by heating. Available animal data on death from exposure to me tallic mercury vapors were also limited to acute- duration exposures (Ashe et al. 1953; Christensen et al . 1937; Livardjani et al. 1991b). Rats, guinea pigs, and mice died from severe pulmonary edema following a 24-48-hour exposure to an unspecifiedconcentration of metallic mercury vapor resulting from spillage of mercury droplets on the floor of a static exposure chamber (Christensen et al . 1937). Exposure of rats to 27 mg/m 3 of elemental mercury vapors for 2 hours, followed by observation for 15 days, resulted in substantial mortality (20 of 32 rats died prior to their scheduled sacrifice) (Livardjani et al. 1991b). Rabbits appeared to be less sensitive, with death occurring in 1 of 2 rabbits exposed to 28.8 mg/m3 metallic mercury for 30 hours and no deaths in rabbits exposed to the same concentration for 20 hours or less (Ashe et al. 1953). All reliable LOAEL values for death following exposure to inorganic mercury in each species and duration category are recorded in Table 2-1 and plotted in Figure 2-1. Organic Mercury. Case studies of occupational exposure to alkyl mercury compounds have reported deaths in humans following inhalation exposure to or ganic mercury vapors. The cause of death was not reported, but most subjects died after developi ng profound neurotoxicity (Hill 1943; Hook et al. 1954). Exposure to diethylmercury vapor (estimated exposure level = 1-1.1 mg/m3) for 4-5 months resulted in the death of 2 women (Hill 1943). The cause of death was not reported; however, the symptoms experiencedby the women were consistent with mercury toxic ity, and autopsies revealed pronounced gastrointestinal disorder. It is unclear whether the gastrointestinal effects were directly attributable to the mercury exposure. A 41-year-old man with 3-4 years of exposure to alkyl mercury compounds used in seed dressing died within approximately 3 months after cleaning up a spill of liquid containing alkyl mercury (Hook et al. 1954). A 57-year-old male employed for 5 years treating lumber with an alkyl mercurypreparation (unspecified) died soon after developi ng neurological toxicity (Lundgren and Swensson 1949). MERCURY 43 2. HEALTH EFFECTS A 39-year-old farmer who had treated seeds with phe nylmercuric acetate for 6-7 seasons died within several months of developing severe neurological toxicity (Brown 1954). Four rats died soon after developing severe ataxia following inhalation of unspecified concentrations of methylmercury iodide vapor for 22 days (Hunter et al. 1940). 2.2.1.2 Systemic Effects The highest NOAEL values and all reliable LOAEL values for systemic effects in each species and duration category are recorded in Table 2-1 and plotted in Figure 2-1. Respiratory Effects Metallic Mercury. In humans, respiratory symptoms are a prominent effect of acute-duration high-level exposure to metallic mercury vapors. The most comm only reported symptoms include cough, dyspnea, and tightness or burning pains in the chest (Bluhm et al. 1992a; Gore and 1992; Teng and Brennan 1959; Tennant et al. 1961). X-ray analyses of the lungs have primarily shown diffuse infiltrates or pneumonitis (Bluhm et al. 1992a; 1954; Soni et al. 1992; Tennant et al. 1961). Pulmonary function may also be impaired. Airway obstruction, restriction, hyperinflation (Snodgrass et al. 1981), and decreased vital capacity (Lilis et al. 1985; McFarland and Reigel 1978) have b een reported. The decreased vital capacity observed by Lilis et al. (1985) persisted for 11 months afte r exposure. In the more severe cases, respiratory distress, pulmonary edema (alveolar and interstitial), The ensuing bronchiolar obstruc and fluid pneumothorax, and possibly death (Campbe ll and Harding 1987; Jaffe et al. Kanluen and Gottlieb 1991; Matthes 1992; Teng and Brennan 1959; Tennant et al. 1961). Little information is available regarding exposure levels resulting in the above symptoms. However, workers accidentally exposed to mercury vapors at an estimated concentration of up to 44.3 mg/m3 for 4-8 hours exhibited chest pains, dyspnea, cough, hem optysis, impairment of pulmonary function (i.e., MERCURY 44 2. HEALTH EFFECTS reduced vital capacity), diffuse pulmonary infiltrates, and evidence of interstitial pneumonitis (McFarland and Reigel 1978). Very little information was located regarding respirat ory effects associated with intermediate-duration exposures. However, two studies noted chronic coughs in subjects exposed to metallic mercury vapor for several weeks (Schwartz et al. 1992; Sexton et al. 1976). No respiratory symptoms and no abnormalities were noted upon examining chest X-rays or the results of pulmonary function tests in a group of chloralkali workers exposed for an average of >6 years to levels of mercury ranging from near 0 to 0.27 mg/m3 (85% of the group was exposed at or below 0.1 mg/m3) (Smith et al. 1970). Respiratory effects in animals have been observed following acute inhalation exposure of metallic mercury vapors. Rats exposed to 27 mg/m3 of elemental mercury vapors for 2 hours then observed for 15 days displayed dyspnea and death due to asphyxiation (L ivardjani et al. 1991b). Respiratory tract lesions included lung edema, necrosis of the alveolar ep ithelium and occasional lung fibrosis. Exposure to 28.8 mg/m3 of mercury vapor lasting from 1 to 20 hours produced effects ranging from mild to moderate pathological changes (unspecified) (Ashe et al. 1953). For exposures lasting 30 hours, marked cellular degeneration and some necros is were observed in the lungs of 1 rabbit. Less severe respiratory changes (unspecified mild-to-moderate pathological ch anges) were reported in rabbits following exposure to metallic mercury vapor at 6 mg/m3 for 7 hours a day, 5 days a week for 1-11 weeks (Ashe et al. 1953). The usefulness of these results is limited because the st udy did not specify the pathological changes nor distinguish between primary and secondary effects (i.e ., pathological changes secondary to induced shock). Congested lungs were observed in rats exposed to 1 mg/m3 metallic mercury vapors for 100 hours continuously per week for 6 weeks (Gage 1961). In rats exposed to 3 mg/m3 mercury vapor for only 3 hours a day, 5 days a week for 12-42 weeks, pathological examination revealed no significant changes in the respiratory system (Kishi et al. 1978). The potential for oral exposure was not quantified in these studies; however, it is likely that most of the exposure was via inhalation. Organic Mercury. Dyspnea, respiratory depression, and resp irations frequently obstructed by mucus were observed in a farmer who had treated grain with phenylmercuric acetate for several seasons (Brown 1954). An autopsy revealed purulent bronchopneumonia. It is unclear whether the respiratory effects were direct MERCURY 45 2. HEALTH EFFECTS effects of the phenylmercuric acetate or secondary to th e severe neurotoxicity also seen in this subject. A case study reported that no respiratory effects were observed in four men inhaling unspecifiedconcentrations of methylmercury for several months (Hunter et al. 1940). Both of these studies are limitedbecause exposure levels were unknown. No studies were located regarding respiratory effect s in animals after inhalation exposure to organic mercury. Cardiovascular Effects Metallic Mercury. Increases in heart rate and blood pressure have been reported following inhalation exposure to metallic mercury in humans. Acute i nhalation exposure to high c oncentrations of metallic mercury vapor generated by hea ting metallic mercury resulted in increased blood pressure (Haddad and Sternberg 1963; Hallee 1969; Snodgrass et al. 1981) and heart al. 1992a; Haddad and Soni et al. 1992; Teng and Brennan 1959). In one of these cases, the increase in heart rate was characterized as a sinus tachycardia (Soni et al. 1992). Exposures of longer durations due to spills or occupational exposures have also been reported to result in increased blood pressure (Fagala and Wigg 1992; Foulds al. 1991; Taueg et and increased heart rate (Fagala and Wigg 1992; Foulds et al. 1987). A single case report was located regarding cardiovascular effects resulting from inhalation ofmercury vapors released from a paint that contained a high level of phenylmercuric acetate (Aronow et al. 1990). The affected child was diagnosed with acrodyni a and exhibited a rapid heart beat and hypertension. Chronic-duration occupational expos ures, however, have given mixed results regarding effects on blood pressure and heart rate. Two studies of workers e xposed to relatively low levels of mercury (near 0-0.27 mg/m 3 in one study and an average of 0.075 mg/m3 in the other) for an average of greater than 6 or 7 years showed no effects on blood pressure or elect rocardiography (Schuckmann 1979; Smith et al. 1970). In contrast, workers exposed to an estimated 0.03 mg/m3 of mercury vapor (estimate based on blood levels) for at least 5 years reported an increased incidence of palpitations, and cardiovascular reflex responses were slightly reduced compared to unexposed matched cont rols (Piikivi 1989). Also, workers in a thermometer plant had a high incidence of hypertension (5 of 9 workers) (Vroom and Greer 1972). A morbidity andmortality study of chloralkali workers show ed an increased likelihood of death due to MERCURY 46 2. HEALTH EFFECTS ischemic heart and cerebrovascular disease (Barregard et al. 1990). These studies are limited, however, because exposure to other chemicals may have contribut ed to the effects observed, exposure levels may have been estimated from only a few actual determina tions, and other risk factors were not consistently considered. Significant increases in systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure were found in volunteers with dental amalgam containing mercury when compared to a control group (matched for age and sex) that had no amalgam fillings (Siblerud 1990). However, the le ngth of time that the individuals had the dental amalgams was not reported. Furthermore, the blood pr essure levels of the amalgam group were closer than those of the nonamalgam group to \"normal\" blood pressure levels reported for the general population. The authors suggested that the populations from which such normal values are drawn are likely to include many people with amalgam dental fillings, but without add itional data to determine which control group would best represent \"normal,\" these results have limited use. In animals, cardiovascular effects were noted follo wing inhalation exposure to mercury vapor. Marked cellular degeneration with some necrosis of heart ti ssue was observed in rabbits following acute intermittent exposure to 28.8 mg/m3 metallic mercury vapor for periods ra nging from 4 to 30 hours (Ashe et al. 1953). Mild-to-moderate pathological changes (unspecifi ed) were seen for 1-4-hour exposures. Exposures to lower concentrations (0.86-6 mg/m3) of mercury vapor for periods ranging from 2 to 12 weeks also resulted in mild-to-moderate pathological changes (unspecified ) in the hearts of rabbits. The usefulness of these results is limited because the study did not specify the pathological changes nor distinguish betweenprimary and secondary effects (i.e., pathologi cal changes secondary to induced shock). Organic Mercury. Only two case histories were located regarding cardiovascular effects in persons exposed by inhalation to organic mercury compounds. No cardiovascular effects were reported in four men hospitalized for neurological symptoms after inhaling an unspecified concentration of methylmercury dust for at least several months (Hunter et al. 1940). Elevated blood pressure was reported in two men exposedoccupationally to methylmercury com pounds (dose not known) (Hook et al. 1954). No studies were located regarding cardiovascular effect s in animals after inhalation exposure to organic mercury. MERCURY 47 2. HEALTH EFFECTS Gastrointestinal Effects Metallic Mercury. Many instances of gastrointestinal effect s have been reported in humans following acute inhalation exposure to metallic mercury vapor. A classical sign of mercury intoxication is stomatitis (inflammation of the oral mucosa). Accordingly, a number of case studies have reported stomatitis after acute-duration exposure to high con centrations of metallic mercury vapors (Bluhm et al. 1992a; Garnier et al. 1981; 1963; Snodgrass et al . 1981; Tennant et al. 1961). Occasionally, the stomatitis was accompanied by excessive salivation (H allee 1969; Karpathios et al. 1991) or difficulty swallowing (Campbell 1948). Other gastrointestinal e ffects observed after acute-duration exposure to high levels of mercury include abdominal pains (Bl uhm et al. 1992a; Campbell 1948; Haddad and Sternberg 1963; Milne et al. 1970; Teng and Brennan 1959), na usea and/or vomiting (Haddad Sternberg 1963; 1969; Kanluen and Gottlieb al. 1981; 1992; Taueg 1992), a (Bluhm et Kanluen and al. 1992; Teng a nd Brennan 1959). The autopsy of a young child who was intoxicated with mercury vapor and died of pulmona ry edema revealed a grayish, necrotic mucosa of the stomach and duodenum (Campbell 1948). Intermediate-duration exposures to merc ury spills have also resulted in similar gastrointestinal effects. A case study reported that teenage girls exhibited anor exia, intermittent abdominal cramps, mild diarrhea, painful mouth, and bleeding gingiva 2 weeks after a spill of metallic mercury in their home (on carpet) resulted in the release of metallic mercury vapor (Sext on et al. 1976). Air levels in the home were measured 6 months after the initial spill and ranged from 0.02 to 1 mg Hg/m3, depending upon the degree of ventilation and proximity to the spill. Fagala and Wigg (1992) reported a case of colicky abdominal pain and diarrhea in a 12-year-old girl exposed to mercury vapors fo r approximately 6 months after a spill in her home. Limited information was located regarding gastrointestin al effects in persons who are chronically exposed to elemental mercury vapors. Stomatitis was observed in 22 of 72 workers exposed to mercury vapors in the manufacture of thermometers in the 1940s (Bucknell et al. 1993). Drooling, sore gums, ulcerations of the oral mucosa, and/or diarrhea were observed in 5 of 9 workers in a thermometer-manufacturing plant (Vroom and Greer 1972). A correlation was also observed between mercury exposure levels and unspecified oropharyngeal symptoms in workers from a chloralkali plant (Smith et al. 1970).MERCURY 48 2. HEALTH EFFECTS Two animal studies assessed the gastroin testinal effects from mercury vapor exposure. In rabbits, effects ranging from mild pathological changes to marked cellula r degeneration and some necrosis of the colon were observed following exposure to 28.8 mg/m3 mercury vapor for 4-30 hours (Ashe et al. 1953). A single exposure to 28.8 mg/m3 for 1-2 hours or multiple exposures of 6 mg/m3 for 7 hours a day, 5 days a week for up to 11 weeks resulted in either no changes or mild pa thological changes. The usefulness of these results is limited because the study did not specify the pathological changes nor distinguish between primary and secondary effects (i.e., pathological changes secondary to induced shock). Organic Mercury. Gastrointestinal effects were reporte d in several case studies of humans exposed to organomercurial compounds. A 39-year-old farmer who had dressed his seeds for several seasons with phenylmercuric acetate exhibited a swollen mouth, reddene d and tender gums, carious teeth, a thin blue line at the gums, and an infected and swollen posterior pharyngeal wall (Brown 1954). Similarly, two women who died following 3-5 months of o ccupational exposure to diethylmercu ry vapors exhibited inflammation of the mouth and gums, excessive salivation, and unsp ecified gastrointestinal disorders (Hill 1943). Marked salivation was observed in one man and nausea was ob served in another occupationally exposed to alkyl- mercury compounds used for dressing seeds (Hook et al. 1954). Gastrointestinal effects were not, however,observed in four men after inhalati on of dust containing methylmercury for several months (Hunter et al. 1940). No studies were located regarding gastrointestinal e ffects in animals after inhalation exposure to organic mercury. Hematological Effects Metallic Mercury. Initial exposure to high concentrations of elemental mercury vapors produces a syndrome similar to \"metal fume fever,\" which is characterized by fatigue, fever, chills, and elevated leukocyte count. Evidence of moderate-to-high leukocyt osis with neutrophilia was reported following acute inhalation exposure to metallic mercury vapor (Campbell 1948; Haddad and Sternberg 1963; Hallee 1969; Jaffe et Matthes et al. 1958; Rowens et al. 1991). Similarly, an elevated white cell count was observe d in a 12-year-old girl with a 6-month exposure to mercury vapors from a spill of metallic mercury in her home (Fagala and Wigg 1992). Thrombocytopenia and frequent nosebleeds were reported in two of four family members exposed to mercury vapors in their MERCURY 49 2. HEALTH EFFECTS home as a result of a spill of metallic mercury (Schwartz et al. 1992). The authors considered this to be a unique reaction to the mercury exposure. In volunteers with dental amalgam, significantly decreased hemoglobin and hematocrit and increased mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentrations were found compar ed to controls without dental amalgams (Siblerud 1990). -Aminolevulinic acid dehydratase activity in er ythrocytes was decreased in workers exposed to elemental mercury in the manufacture of tungsten rods (Wada et al. 1969). The decreases correlated withincreases in urinary mercury. The estimated exposure le vel to mercury in the plant was slightly less than 0.1 mg/m 3. In workers exposed to 0.106-0.783 mg/m3 mercury vapor, there was a significant increase in 2-macroglobulin and ceruloplasmin (an -globulin protein active in the storage and transport of copper) compared to unexposed workers (Bencko et al. 1990). No studies were located regarding hematological effect s in animals after inhalation exposure to inorganic mercury. Organic Mercury. No studies were located regarding hematological effects in humans or animals after inhalation exposure to organic mercury. Musculoskeletal Effects Metallic Mercury. A number of studies have reported increases in tremors, muscle fasciculations, myoclonus, or muscle pains after acute (Adams et al. 1983; Bluhm et al. 1992a; 1976; Taueg et al. 1992), or chronic (Albers et al. 1982, 1988; Bidstrup et al. 1951; Chaffin et al. 1973; Chapman et al. 1990; Fawer et al. 1983; Smith et al. 1970; Verberk et al. 1986; Vroom and Greer 1972; Williamson et al.1982) exposure to metallic mercury vapor. These effect s are probably neurally mediated and are discussed more fully in Section 2.2.1.4. No studies were located regarding musculoskeletal e ffects in animals after inhalation exposure to metallic mercury. Organic Mercury. Exposure to unspecified alkyl mercury compounds has caused muscular effects (e.g., muscle fasciculations, absence of deep reflexes in arms, Babinski reflex) (Brown 1954; Hook et al. 1954; MERCURY 50 2. HEALTH EFFECTS Hunter et al. 1940). These effects may have been secondary to neurological changes and are discussed more fully in Section 2.2.1.4. No studies were located regarding musculoskeletal eff ects in animals after inhalation exposure to organic mercury. Hepatic Effects Metallic Mercury. A case study described the acute poisoning of a young child who was exposed to mercury vapors that were produced from heating an unknown quantity of mercury (Jaffe et al. 1983). Hepatocellular effects were characterized by bi ochemical changes (e.g., elevated ase, and serum bilirubin levels) and evidence of a decrease in the synthesis of hepatic coagulation fact ors. Similarly, hepatomegaly and central lobular vacuolation were observed in a man who died following acute-duration exposure to high levels of elemental mercury vapors (Kanluen and Gottlieb 1991; Rowens et al. 1991). Serious liver effects have been noted in animals at high exposure concentrations. Acute inhalation exposure of rabbits to metallic mercury va por concentrations of 28.8 mg/m3 for 6-30 hours resulted in effects ranging from moderate pathological changes (unspecified) to sev ere liver necrosis (Ashe et al. 1953). These effects were less severe (mild effects to degeneration) at shorter exposure durations and following exposure to 6 mg/m3 mercury vapors for 7 hours a day, 5 days a week for 1-5 weeks (Ashe et al. 1953). Effects ranging from moderate pathological changes to marked cellu lar degeneration and some necrosis were seen at mercury concentrations of 6 mg/m3 for 7 hours a day, 5 days a week for 6-11 weeks (Ashe et al. 1953). No hepatic changes were present in a pathological examina tion of the livers of rats intermittently exposed to 3 mg/m3 mercury vapor for only 3 hours a day, 5 days a week for 12-42 weeks (Kishi et al. 1978). The studies by Ashe et al. (1953) and Kishi et al. (1978) were deficient in quantitative data, and used a small number of animals. However, available human and animal data suggest that metallic mercury vapors can cause liver effects following acute exposures. Organic Mercury . Midzonal necrosis in the liver was obser ved during the autopsy of a farmer who died after treating grain with phenylmercuric acetate for several seasons (Brown 1954). No conclusions can be drawn from this study, however, because other factors ma y have contributed to the hepatic effects in this subject. No studies were located regarding hepatic effects in animals after inhalation exposure to organic mercury.MERCURY 51 2. HEALTH EFFECTS Renal Effects Metallic Mercury. The kidney is a sensitive target organ of toxicity following inhalation exposure to metallic mercury. This sensitivity may be, in part, because of the relatively high accumulation of mercury in the kidneys. Acute high-concentration inhalation e xposure in humans has resulted in effects ranging from mild transient proteinuria or s syndrome has been reported light changes in urinary acid excretion (Bluhm et al. et al. 1981); to acute renal failure with de generation or necrosis of the proximal convoluted tubules (Campbell 1948; Jaffe et al. 1983; Kanluen and Gottlieb 1991; Rowens et al. 1991). Actual exposure concentrations are unknown in these cases, but urinary mercury excretion as high as 59-193 \u00b5g/hour hasbeen reported (Bluhm et al. 1992b). A intermediate-dur ation exposure (Agner and Jans 1978; Friberg et al. 1953). In one report, the exposure was to a spill in the home (Agner and Jans 1978); in the other, the exposure was occupational (Friberg et al. 1953). The nephrotic syndrome was characterized by edema and proteinuria with albumin and hyaline casts in the urin e. These changes usually abated within a few months following termination of exposure. Among a group of 10 patients who reported adverse effects associated with dental amalgams (the route of exposure in de ntal amalgams is probably a mixture of inhalation exposure to mercury vapor released from the amalgams , absorption of the vapor through the oral mucosa, and ingestion), a decrease in the ability to concentrate the urine and elevated urinary albumin were observed (Anneroth et al. 1992). Removal of one amalgam resulted in a significant decrease in urinary albumin (it isunknown whether other amalgams remained). In a st udy of renal function in 10 healthy volunteers having an average of 18 amalgam-filled tooth surfaces both before and after amalgam removal (Sandborgh-Englund and Nygren 1996), no signs of renal toxicity were found in conjunction with mercury released from the amalgam fillings. Although plasma mercury levels in creased significantly one day after removal of the fillings (all removals were accomplishe d in one dental session), glomerular filtration rates were similar both before and after mercury exposure (amalgam removal) . Blood, plasma, and urine mercury concentrations were significantly lower 60 days after amalgam removal. The results from a number of studies show renal toxic ity in workers chronically exposed to mercury vapor (Barregard et al. 1988; Bernard et al. 1987; Buchet et al. 1980; Cardenas et al. 1993; Danziger and MERCURY 52 2. HEALTH EFFECTS Possick et al. al. 1983; Sunderman 1978; Tubbs et al. 1982). Several of these reports have focused on workers with proteinuria (Danziger and Possick 1973; Kazantzis et al. 1962; Tubbs et al. 1982), while others have exam ined a variety of urinary parameters in exposed populations. Biopsies in the studies of workers with proteinuria have shown both proximal tubular and glomerular changes. In the report by Kazantzis et al. (1962), heavy albuminuria was reported to be accompanied by both proximal tubular damage and glomerulosclerosis. Examination of tissue samplesfrom two other workers with proteinuria showed chang es in the foot processes of cells associated with the glomerular basement membrane and depos ition of IgG and C3 (Tubbs et al. 1982). Comparisons of exposed populations to controls have shown a variety of changes in exposed workers, ranging from no effects (Bernard et al. 1987; Piikiv i and Ruokonen 1989) to increases in urinary protein (Stewart et al. 1977), the specific gravity of the urine (Ehrenberg et al. 1991), and urinary N-acetyl- -glucosaminidase 1996; Langworth et al. 1992b). A detailed examination of markers for urinary dysfunc increases excretion glycans, prostaglandin E2 and F2 , and thromboxane B2 (Cardenas et al. 1993). Several studies have also shown correlations with some of these parameters and urinary mercury content (Buchet et al. 1980; Cardenas et al. Ehrenberg et al. 1992b; Roels et al. 1982; Stonard et al. 1983). Attempts to define threshold levels for effects ha ve produced mixed results. A no-effect level of 72 \u00b5g Hg/g creatinine excretion of albumin, 2-microglobulin, or retinol binding protein (Bernard et al. 1987). However, other studi es have shown increases in urinary albumin levels >50 \u00b5g Hg/g urinary N-acetyl- -glucosaminidase Hg/g creatinine. Boogaard et al. (1996) reported that after exposure to mercury with urinary levels below the biological exposure index of 35 \u00b5g/g creatinine, a transient increase in NAG was observe d, but there was no correlation with duration of exposure and that this increase was not an early indicator of developing renal dysfunction. More information on correlation between urinary mercury leve ls and renal toxicity can be found in Section 2.5. Serious degenerative effects have been observed in the kidneys of animals exposed to moderate-to-high levels of metallic mercury vapors following acute- a nd intermediate-duration exposures (Ashe et al. 1953). Effects ranging from marked cellular degeneration to tissue destruction and widespread necrosis were observed in rabbits exposed to mercury vapor at a concentration of 28.8 mg/m3 for 2-30 hours. Moderate MERCURY 53 2. HEALTH EFFECTS pathological changes (unspecified) were also seen for 1-hour exposures. As the duration of exposure increased to 30 hours, extensive cell necrosis in th e kidneys became evident. These results and the following results are limited as to their usefulness because the pathological changes are not described. In an intermediate-duration study, rabbits exposed to mercury vapor concentrations of 0.86 mg/m3 for 7 hours a day, 5 days a week for 12 weeks exhibite d moderate pathological kidney changes that were reversible with cessation of exposure (Ashe et al. 1953). Larger doses (6 mg/m3) administered for 7 hours a day, 5 days a week for up to 11 weeks, produced e ffects that ranged from mild, unspecified, pathological changes to marked cellular degeneration a nd widespread necrosis (Ashe et al. 1953). In rats, slight degenerative chang es (i.e., dense deposits in tubule cells and lysosomal inclusions) in the renal tubular epithelium were evident following exposure to 3 mg/m3 mercury vapor for 3 hours a day, 5 days a week for 12-42 weeks (Kishi et al. 1978). Low-level chronic-duration i nhalation exposures to 0.1 mg/m3 metallic mercury vapor for 7 hours a day, 5 days a week for 72-83 weeks in rats, rabbits, a nd dogs produced no microscopic evidence of kidney damage (Ashe et al. 1953). Only two dogs were tested in the study. Organic Mercury. An autopsy of a man who died after acu te high-level exposure to alkyl mercury vapor revealed necrosis of the tubule epithelium, swolle n granular protoplasm, and nonstainable nuclei in the kidneys (Hook et al. 1954). No studies were available on renal effects following intermediate or chronic- duration exposure to organic mercury vapors in humans. No studies were located regarding renal effects in animals after inhalation exposure to organic mercury. Endocrine Effects Metallic Mercury. A 13-year-old boy exposed to mercury vapors for 2 weeks developed a thyroid enlargement with elevated triiodothyronine, and th yroxine; and low thyroid-stimulating hormone levels (Karpathios et al. 1991). Serum-free thyroxine (T4) a nd of free thyroxine to free 3,5,3'-triiodo- thyronine (T3) were found to be slightly, but signi ficantly, higher in workers with the highest exposure concentrations in a study of chloralkali workers e xposed an average of 10 years to metallic mercury vapor (Barregard et al. 1994a, 1994b). Further, serum-free T3 was inversely associated with cumulative mercury exposure, suggesting a possible inhibitory effect of mercury on 5'-deiodinases, which is responsible for theMERCURY 54 2. HEALTH EFFECTS conversion of T4 to the active hormone T3. In th is study, serum total testosterone (but not free testosterone) was positively correlated with cumulativ e mercury exposure, while prolactin, thyrotrophin, and urinary cortisol concentrations were not associat ed with exposure. Howeve r, two other occupational studies found no relationship between mercury exposure ( unspecified concentration) and endocrine function (i.e., testicular, thyroid, and pituitary) (Erfurth et al. 1990; McGregor and Mason 1991). Biochemical indices that were measured in the occupational st udy by McGregor and Mason (1991) to assess endocrine effects included serum testosterone, sex-hormone binding globulin, thyroid-stimulating hormone, prolactin. Erfurth measured serum concentrations of thyrotropin, thyroxine, triiodothyronine, and cortisol, as well as the response to a thyrotropin challenge. No studies were located regarding endocrine effect s in animals after inhalation exposure to metallic mercury. Organic Mercury. No studies were located regarding endocrine effects in humans or animals after inhalation exposure to organic mercury. Dermal Effects Metallic Mercury. Inhalation exposure of individuals to elemental mercury vapors for acute and intermediate durations has resulted in erythematous and pruritic skin al. 1991; Schwartz et al. 1992; Sexton et al. 1976). Other dermal reactions to mercury exposure include heav y al. 1991; Sexton et al. 1976) and reddened and/or peeling skin on the palms of the hands and soles of the feet (Aronow et al. 1990; Fagala and Wigg 1992; Karpathios et al. 1991). No studies were located regarding dermal effects in animals after inhalation exposure to metallic mercury. Organic Mercury. No studies were located regarding dermal effects in humans or animals after inhalation exposure to organic mercury.MERCURY 55 2. HEALTH EFFECTS Ocular Effects Metallic Mercury. Ocular effects observed following acute exposure included red, burning eyes and conjunctivitis (Bluhm et al. 1992a; Sexton et al. 1976). Workers chronically exposed to mercury have also exhibited a peculiar grayish-brown or yellow haze on the outer surface of their lenses (Atkinson 1943; Bidstrup et al. 1951; Locket and Nazroo 1952). These case studies contained insufficient quantitative datafor dose-response assessment. No studies were located regarding ocular effects in animals after inhalation exposure to metallic mercury. Organic Mercury. No studies were located regarding ocular effects in humans or animals after inhalation exposure to organic mercury. Other Systemic Effects Metallic Mercury. Initial exposure to high concentrations of elemental mercury vapors produces a syndrome similar to \"metal fume fever,\" which is ch aracterized by fatigue, fever, chills, and an elevated leukocyte count. Accordingly, several studies have re ported fever and/or chills in humans after exposure to high concentrations of elemental mercury vapors (Ar onow et al. 1990; Bluhm et al. al. 1970; Schwartz et al. 1992; Snodgrass et al. 1981). Organic Mercury. No studies were located regarding other sy stemic effects in humans or animals after inhalation exposure to organic mercury. 2.2.1.3 Immunological and Lymphoreticular Effects Metallic Mercury. The immune reaction in humans to mercur y exposure appears to be idiosyncratic, with either increases or decreases in immune activity depending on individual ge netic predisposition (see Section 2.4). Therefore, it is not surprising that sev eral studies of workers exposed to elemental mercury vapor have failed to show consistent or marked changes in immune function parameters in large populations. For example, no effect on serum immunoglobulins (IgA, IgG, or IgM) and no increase inautoantibody titres were observed in a group of chloralk ali workers exposed for an average of 13.5 years MERCURY 56 2. HEALTH EFFECTS (Langworth et al. 1992b). Similarly, no increases in antilaminin antibodies were observed in workers exposed for an average of 7.9 years (Bernard et al. 1987), and no increase in antiglomerular basement membrane antibodies or IgE was seen in workers expo sed for between 1.5 and 25 years (Cardenas et al. 1993). Slight decreases in IgA and IgG were observed in workers after more than 20 years of exposure to metallic mercury vapors when compared to unexposed controls (Moszczynski et al. 1990b). No significant differences in the concentrations of immunoglobulins or complement components were found in a study of 76 chloralkali workers previously exposed to me rcury vapor for an average of 7.9 years (range, 1.1-36.2 years) (Ellingsen et al. 1994). No increase in the prevalence of autoantibodies was observed between the formerly exposed worker group and a cont rol group of 53 age-matched referents. The average time elapsed since the cessation of occupational exposure was 12.3 years (range, 1-35 years). Evidence of a human autoimmune response has been obt ained in a few studies. Examination of the kidneys of two workers with proteinuria revealed granular deposition of IgG and the complement C3 in the glomeruli (Tubbs et al. 1982). Among a group of 10 pa tients who reported adverse effects associated with dental amalgams (the route of exposure is probabl y a mixture of inhalation exposure to mercury vapor released from the amalgams and dermal exposure to the amalgams), 3 had increased antiglomerular basement membrane antibodies and 2 had elevated antinuclear antibodies (Anneroth et al. 1992). Afterremoval of one amalgam, there was a significant decrease in IgE (it is unknown whether other amalgamsremained). Also, 1 of 89 workers examined by Langworth et al. (1992b) showed a weak reaction toantiglomerular basement membrane, and 8 of 44 worker s examined by Cardenas et al. (1993) showed an abnormally high anti-DNA antibody titre. Only two st udies have shown increases in immune parameters in exposed populations. Increases in IgA and IgM were observed in workers in a mercury producing plant (Bencko et al. 1990). The study is limited by a l ack of information on daily dose levels, duration of employment and potential confounding factors (smoking, alcohol). An increase in anti-DNA antibodieswas observed in workers from a chlora lkali plant (Cardenas et al. 1993). Other experimental evidence suggests that mercury can alter a number of parameters of the host's immune system and lead to increased susceptibility to infecti ons, autoimmune diseases, and allergic manifestations. In workers exposed to mercury vapor concentrations of 0.024-0.09 mg/m 3 for less than 10 and up to 31 years (Moszczynski et al. 1995), the stimulation of T-lymphocytes (as manifested by an increasednumber of T-cells [CD3+], and T-suppressors [CD8+]) was observed in peripheral blood; however, no significant effect was seen on NK-cell (CD16+) count. A positive correlation was found between the T-helper cell count and the duration of exposure (p<0.05). The combined stimulation of MERCURY 57 2. HEALTH EFFECTS the T-cell line and an observed decrease in the helper /suppressor ratio were suggestive of an autoimmune response. In a mercury-producing plant, neutrophil function was found to be significantly reduced in workers with a mean exposure duration of 8 months (range, 0.5-46 mont hs) (Perlingeiro and Queiroz 1995). In this study, both chemotactic and chemical-specific reducing activ ities of the neutrophils of exposed workers were found to be affected. While improved industrial hy giene practices over a 6-month period resulted in a decrease in urine mercury concentration in the workers, it did not result in the return of neutrophil migration activity to within the normal range. There was, however, no observed increase in the incidence of infections in the mercury-exposed group compared to controls. Based on their observations, Perlingeiro and Queiroz (1995) suggested that even exposures to leve ls of mercury considered \"safe\" in some industrial settings may lead to impairment of neutrophil function. Exposure of genetically susceptible mice to mercur y vapor for a period of 10 weeks resulted in an autoimmune response similar to that seen in simila r mice after treatment with mercuric chloride by subcutaneous injections and in dr inking water (Warfvinge et al. 1995). This response was manifested as a syndrome, which included a general stimulation of the immune system, with hyperimmunoglobulinemia, anti-nucleolar-fibrillarin autoantibodies, and glomerular disease accompanied by vascular immune Actual inhalation exposure times for the 0.3-1 mg Hg/m 3 exposure concentrations varied from 0.5 to 19 hours a day (5 days a week), but doses for individual exposure groups were also expressed in \u00b5g/kg/week units. The LOAEL for serum antinucle olar antibodies was determined to be an absorbed dose of 0.170 mg Hg/kg/week (from a 1.5-hour daily exposure to 0.5 mg/m3) and the corresponding NOAEL was a calculated absorbed dose of 0.075 mg/kg/day (from a 0.5-hour daily exposure to0.0005 mg/m 3). Higher doses were required for B-cell stim ulation and for the development of immune complex deposits. The highest NOAEL values and all reliable LOAEL va lues for immunological effects in each species and duration category are recorded in Table 2-1 and plotted in Figure 2-1. Organic Mercury. No studies were located regarding immunological and lymphoreticular effects in humans or animals after inhalation exposure to organic mercury.MERCURY 58 2. HEALTH EFFECTS 2.2.1.4 Neurological Effects Metallic Mercury. The central nervous system is probably the most sensitive target organ for metallic mercury vapor exposure. Nervous system disorders following exposure to metallic mercury vapors are both consistent and pronounced. Acute-, intermediate -, and chronic-duration exposures elicit similar neurological effects. Symptoms intensify and ma y become irreversible as exposure duration and/or concentration increases. Most occupational studies discuss chronic-duration exposure to a time-weightedaverage (TWA) concentration or to a concentra tion range, thereby preventing the assessment of dose- response relationships within the populations studied. However, the average exposure levels for affected groups are similar in many of these studies. In humans, several case studies have reported adver se neurological effects following acute inhalation of high concentrations of mercury vapor. A wide va riety of cognitive, personality, sensory, and motor disturbances have been reported. The most prominen t symptoms include tremors (initially affecting the hands and sometimes spreading to other parts of the body ), emotional lability (characterized by irritability, excessive shyness, confidence loss, and nervousness), insomnia, memory loss, neuromuscular changes (weakness, muscle atrophy, muscle twitching), headach es, polyneuropathy (paresthesia, stocking-glove sensory loss, hyperactive tendon reflexes, slowed sensory and motor nerve conduction velocities), and performance deficits in tests of cognitive functi on (Adams et al. 1983; Bluhm et al. 1992a; Reigel 1978; Snodgrass et al. 1981). A few individuals have also noted hearing loss, visual disturbances (visual field defects), and/or hallucinations (Bluhm et al. 1992a ; McFarland and Reigel 1978). In a case study of exposure to a calculated metallic mercury vapor level of 44 mg/m 3 for <8 hours, workers experienced long-lasting feelings of irritability, lack of ambition, and lack of sexual desire (McFarland and Reigel 1978). Three and one-half months after exposure to high levels of me rcury vapor during 2 days of an industrial liquid mercury salvaging operation, a 54-year-old man e xhibited a syndrome resembling amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, characterized by slowed conduction velociti es (suggestive of peripheral nerve damage). Urinary mercury levels were 100 \u00b5g/g creatinine at the time of the exam; after an additional 2 months (no treatment administered), levels dropped to less than 30 \u00b5g/g creatinine and symptoms disappeared (Adams et al. 1983). In contrast, chelation therapy (2.3 dimer captosuccinic acid [DMSA] or - acetyl-D,L-penicillamine [NAP]) and lowering of urinary mercury levels di d not result in improvement in depression, anxiety, phobias, psychotic-like behavior, interpersonal sen sitivity, and hostility observed in another group of workers exposed to high concentrations of merc ury vapor for up to 16 hours (Bluhm et al. 1992a).MERCURY 59 2. HEALTH EFFECTS In case reports of individuals exposed to inorganic me rcury vapor for an intermediate duration, similar effects were reported (Barber 1978; Fagala and Wigg et al. 1976; Taueg et al. 1992). After 6 months of e xposure to a spill of metallic mercury in the place where she slept, a 12-year-old girl experienced dizziness, joint pains, weakness, insomnia, numbness and tingling in her palms, decreased pinprick and vibration sensations in the lower extremities, intentional tremors, a slowing of the background rhythms on electroencephalograms, irritability, outbursts of temper, shyness,sensitivity, auditory hallucinations, ala and Wigg 1992). Similarly, a 4-year-old boy exposed for approximately 1 month to mercury va pors released from paint containing phenylmercuric acetate exhibited irritability, personality change, inso mnia, headaches, weakness, and nerve dysfunction in the lower extremities (Aronow et al. 1990). This study is not discussed under organic mercury because theexposure was to metallic mercury vapors released from the paint. Two adolescents (ages 13 and 15) who were unintentiona lly exposed to concentrated mercury vapors for 3 months developed a variety of more immediate- and long-term effects (Yeates and Mortensen 1994). In the 15-year-old male, the earliest symptoms include d declining school performance, irritability, depression, neurobehavioral complaints, tremor, rash, hypertensi on, cold intolerance, diaphoresis, headaches, sleep disturbance, paresthesias, and anorexia. He was re ferred to a pediatric teaching hospital, where he was diagnosed with acrodynia and mercury poisoning. Be fore undergoing two courses of chelation therapy with 2,3-dimercaptosuccoinic acid (DMSA), his average 24-hour urine mercury and blood mercury levels were 1,314 \u00b5g/L and 23 \u00b5g/L, respectively. His 13-year-old half-sister, who was also exposed, had pretreatment average 24-hour urine mercury and blood mercury levels of 624 \u00b5g/L and 69 \u00b5g/L, respectively; her pre- treatment medical symptoms included tremor, rash, anorexia, paresthesias, and neuropsychiatric complaints(e.g., irritability, social withdrawal, and emotional la bility). On hospital admission, she was diagnosed with acrodynia and underwent three courses of DMSA treatme nt, which were complicated by severe peripheral neuropathy, accompanied by a significant weight loss. Although the neuropathy was relatively mild at the time of initial neurological evaluation, it became progressi vely worse, and eventually the patient required a wheelchair and assistance eating. The neuropathy had resolved by the 1-year follow-up neuropsychological evaluation; however, despite removal from exposure, return of blood and urinary mercury to acceptable levels, and resolution of clinical signs of mercur y poisoning and associated neuropsychiatric symptoms, both patients continued to show ma jor deficits in visuoperceptual and constructional skills, nonverbal memory, and abstract reasoning.MERCURY 60 2. HEALTH EFFECTS A worker (age, mid-40s) exposed to mercury in a thermometer factory for approximately 3.5 years experienced acute, intermediate, chronic, and delayed neurological effects (White et al. 1993). During his employment, he performed a variety of functions, including sweeping mercury off floors with a vacuum cleaner or hose blower, repairing and cleaning machines, disassembling machines containing mercury, andoperating a machine that crushed instruments so th at he could then separate the mercury from other materials for reuse. From approximately the beginning of his employment at the factory, he experienced anumber of symptoms, including blurred vision, ocular pain, rash, a strange taste in the mouth, weakness,memory loss, rage, and irrational behavior. The month following his release by the factory, his urinemercury concentration was measured at 690 \u00b5g/L, whic h confirmed a diagnosis of mercury poisoning. He was treated by chelation with penicillamine over a 2-month period; approximately 2 months after the completion of treatment, his urine mercury level was only 17 \u00b5g/L. Approximately 21months after termination of his employment, neurological examin ation revealed nystagmus on upward gaze, bilateral manual tremor, diminished sensation to pain, periphe ral neuropathy, and abnorma lities in nerve conduction. An magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examination re vealed mild central and cortical atrophy, with punctiform foci of T2 in both frontal regions, especi ally underlying the precentral gyri and in the white matter (both subcortical and gyri). The MRI data were interpreted as consistent with diffuse and focal white matter disease. Neuropsychological testing conduc ted during the same time period revealed problems with cognitive function, fine manual motor coordinati on, visuospatial analysis and organization, memory for visuospatial information, affect , and personality almost 2 years after cessation of employment at the factory. In contrast with the long-term (perhaps permanent) effects noted in the previous study, Yang et al. (1994) reported that recovery from chronic elemental mercur y intoxication may be complete when patients are removed early from the exposure environment. A 29-year-old worker in a Taiwanese lampsocket- manufacturing facility, with an initial urinary mercury concentration of 610 \u00b5g/L (in a 24-hour sample) and a blood mercury concentration of 237 \u00b5g/L (reference ra nge, <10 \u00b5g/L), exhibited a variety of symptoms, including blurred vision, dysarthria, prominent gingi vitis, tremors (usually postural and intentional), unsteady gait, and slow mental response. The TWA con centration of mercury in the air in the room where he spent most of his working time during his 5 years on the job was 0.945 mg/m 3. The worker also had a higher blood lead concentration of 450 \u00b5g/L (reference ra nge, <20 \u00b5g/L), and lead toxicity or interactions with mercury could have occurred. The man unde rwent an 8-week course of chelation with D- penicillamine, which resulted in a rapid improvement in gait; a complete recovery from all symptoms occurred over a 4-month period. MERCURY 61 2. HEALTH EFFECTS A 27-year-old female, who worked primarily in a room with a TWA mercury air concentration of 0.709 g/m3 and who had been on the job for 1.5 years, showed a variety of symptoms, including gum pain, dizziness, poor attention, bad temper, some numbness, hypersalivation, hyperhidrosis, dizziness, and fatigue. She had initial urine and blood mercury levels of 408 \u00b5g/L a nd 105 \u00b5g/L, respectively, but did not require chelation; the symptoms abated fully approxi mately 2 months following discontinuation of exposure (Yang et al. 1994). Other chronic-duration exposures to metallic mercury vapor have resulted in tremors (which may be mild or severe depending on the degree of exposure), unsteady wa lking, irritability, poor concentration, short-term memory deficits, tremulous speech, blurred vision, performance decrements in psychomotor skills (e.g., finger tapping, reduced hand-eye coordination), par esthesias, decreased nerve conduction, and other signs of neurotoxicity al. et al et al. et al. et al. 1990; Fawer et al. 1983; Langolf et al. and Oler 1986; Vroom and Greer 1972; Williamson et al. 1982). The majority of studies suggestthat motor system disturbances are reversible upon exposure cessation, while cognitive impairments, primarily memory deficits, may be permanent (C haffin et al. 1973; Hanninen 1982; Miller et al. 1975). Several studies have noted correlations between e xposure level or duration and effects (e.g., memory deficits, psychomotor coordination, motor and sen sory nerve conduction velocities, electromyographic abnormalities, evidence of polyneuropathy, tremor , emotional changes, reflex abnormalities, and electroencephalographic changes) (Albers et al. 1982; Iyer et al. 1976; Levine et al. 1982; Smith et al. 1983;Vroom and Greer 1972; Williamson et al. 1982). Ea rly studies suggested that frank neurotoxicity (pronounced tremors, erethism, restriction of visual fields, difficulty seeing) was generally observed at>300 \u00b5g mercury in a 24-hour urine (Bidstrup et al. 1951) or at >0.1 mg/m 3 (Smith et al. 1970). More recent studies using sensitive tests for psychomotor skills, tremor, and peripheral nerve function suggest that adverse effects may be associated with very low exposures (see below). However, conflicting information exists regarding thr esholds for neurotoxic effects. Several reports have presented essentially negative findings at low exposure levels (0.025-0.076 mg/m3). Chloralkali workers exposed to low air levels of mercury vapors for at least 5 years (group average, 14 years) reported an increase in memory disturbances, sleep disorders, anger, fatigue, confusion, and hand tremors compared to the controls (Piikivi and Hanninen 1989). However, tests of psychomotor MERCURY 62 2. HEALTH EFFECTS coordination and memory showed no significant deficits in the exposed group. The exposed and control groups were matched for age, sex, vocational status, education, and mean number of amalgam fillings. A group-average exposure concentration of 0.025 mg/m3 mercury vapors was estimated from repeated analyses of blood mercury concentration (mean, 51.3 nmol/L .10 \u00b5g/L) (see the discussion regarding these estimated exposure levels in Section 2.5). Also, no effects on tremors, bimanual coordination, color determination, or reaction time were observed in chlora lkali workers with more than 7 years of exposure to low levels of mercury; ambient air levels measure d for 2 years prior to testing averaged 0.076 mg/m3 and the average blood level in the workers was 19.9 \u00b5g /L (Schuckmann 1979). Negative findings were also noted when the results of tremor frequency spectra a nd psychometric tests of a group of chloralkali workers exposed for an average of 13.5 years were compared to unexposed controls (Langworth et al. 1992a). The TWA exposure level was estimated to be 0.025 mg/m3, based on measurements taken at the time of the study, and blood levels in the workers averaged 55 nmol/L ( .11 \u00b5g/L). Despite the negative objective findings, subjective reports of fatigue, memory disturba nces, and confusion were significantly higher in the exposed workers. Boogaard et al. (1996) evaluated the effects of expos ure to elemental mercury on the nervous system and the kidneys of workers producing natural gas in the Ne therlands. Early signs of alterations in renal and neurological functions were studied in three groups of workers who were exposed to different levels of mercury that were below the current ACGIH biologi cal exposure index of 35 \u00b5g/g creatinine. Air concentrations ranged from 10 to 1,500 \u00b5g/m3 (median, 67) at locations where mercury exposure was anticipated; the potential 8-hour TWA exposure ranged from 33 to 781 \u00b5g/m3 (median, 88). Air concentrations ranged from 0 to 6 \u00b5g/m3 at locations where little mercury exposure was expected. Current mercury concentrations in urine were 23.7, 4.1, a nd 2.4 \u00b5g/g in high, low, and control exposure groups, respectively; mercury concentrations in blood were 3. 5, 1.5, and 2.2 \u00b5g/L, respectively. There were no differences among the three study groups with respect to either motor nerve conduction velocity or tremor frequency spectra of physiological tremors. Also , no significant correlations were found between the results of the neurological tests and any of the present or historical biological monitoring data. In contrast to the negative findings above, several studies have shown significant effects on tremor or on cognitive skills at comparable or lower group-average exposure levels (0.014-0.076 mg/m3). Using the same paradigm as Langworth et al. (1992a), a significant difference was seen in the tremor frequencyspectra in mercury-exposed workers from three industri es who were exposed to low levels of mercury for an average of 15.3 years (range, 1-41 years) when comp ared to unexposed controls (Fawer et al. 1983). MERCURY 63 2. HEALTH EFFECTS The TWA mercury concentration measured in the work area at the time of the study was 0.026 mg Hg/m3 (range not reported). It was assumed that the workers were exposed to the same concentration of mercury for the duration of their employment. However, the group size was small, and the results may have beeninfluenced by a small number of more severely affected individuals. It is also possible that the tremors may have resulted from intermittent exposure to concentrati ons higher than the TWA. Urinary mercury levels in these workers averaged 11. 3 \u00b5mol/mol creatinine ( .20 \u00b5g/g creatinine). Tremors have also been associated with occupational exposures that produced urinary concentrations of 50-100 \u00b5g/g creatinine and blood levels of 10-20 \u00b5g/L (Roels et al. 1982). Difficulty with heel-to-toe gait was observed in thermometer- plant workers subjected to mean personal-br eathing-zone air concentrations of 0.076 mg/m 3 (range, 0.026-0.27 mg/m3) (Ehrenberg et al. 1991). Decreases in performance on tests that measured intellig ence (a similarities test) and memory (digit span and visual reproduction tests) were observed in chlora lkali workers exposed for an average of 16.9 years to low levels of mercury when compared to an age- matched control group (Piikivi et al. 1984). Significant differences from controls were observed among workers with blood levels >75 nmol/L ( .15 \u00b5g/L) \u00b5g/L). Dentists (n=98, mean age 32, range 24-49) with an average of 5.5 years of exposure to low levels of mercury showed impaired performance on several ne urobehavioral tests (Ngim et al. 1992). Exposure levels measured at the time of the study ranged from 0.0007 to 0.042 mg/m3 (average, 0.014 mg/m3) and blood levels ranged from 0.6 to 57 \u00b5g/L (average, 9.8 \u00b5g/L). Controls we re matched for age, fish consump- tion, and number of amalgam fillings. Differences in education, sex distribution, and reported use of Chinese traditional medicines that might contain mercury we re adjusted for in the statistical analysis. The dentists showed significantly poorer performance on finger tapping (measures motor speed), trail making(measures visual scanning), digit symbol (measures visuomotor coordination and concentration), digit span,logical memory delayed recall (measures visual memory), and Bender-Gestalt time (measures visuomotorcoordination). The dentists had a higher aggression score than the controls. Correlations were observed for exposure levels and duration. This study is limited, however, by lack of blinding and failure to report control mercury levels; the statistical procedur es used for confounders (use of traditional Chinese medicines) were not reported. In a study of the relation between cumulative expos ure to mercury and chronic health impairment, 298 dentists had their mercury levels measured by an X-ray fluorescence technique. Electrodiagnostic and neuropsychological findings in the dentists with more than 20 \u00b5g/g tissue (head and wrist) mercury levelsMERCURY 64 2. HEALTH EFFECTS were compared with those of a control group consisti ng of dentists with no de tectable mercury levels. Twenty-three out of 298 dentists with the highest merc ury levels were administered neurological tests and compared to controls. The high mercury group had slowed conduction velocities in motor (median nerve) and sensory (suralnerve) nerves, mild neuropsychol ogical impairment (increased errors in the Bender- Gestalt test), mild visuographic dysfunction, and hi gher distress levels (self-reported) than the control group. Seven of the high exposure dentists showed manifestations of polyneuropathy. Exposure concentrations were not specified. No polyneuropathi es were detected in the control group (Shapiro et al. 1982). Abnormal nerve conduction velocities have also been observed at a mean urine concentration of 450 \u00b5g/L in workers from a chloralkali plant (Lev ine et al. 1982). These workers also experienced weakness, paresthesias, and muscle cramps. Prol ongation of brainstem aud itory-evoked potentials was observed in workers with urinary mercury levels of 325 \u00b5g/g creatinine (Discalzi et al. 1993). Prolonged somatosensory-evoked potentials were f ound in 28 subjects exposed to 20-96 mg/m3 of mercury (Langauer-Lewowicka and Kazibutowska 1989). In animals, as in humans, adverse neurological and behavioral effects are prominent following inhalation exposure to high concentrations of metallic mercury vapor. However, animals appear to be less sensitive than humans. Marked cellular degeneration and widespr ead necrosis were observed in the brains of rabbits following exposures to metallic mercury vapor at 28.8 mg/m3 for durations ranging from 2 to 30 hours (Ashe et al. 1953). Exposures of 1 hour produced moderate (unspecified) pathological changes. Intermediate-duration expos ure of rabbits to 6 mg/m3 mercury vapor for periods of 1-11 weeks produced effects ranging from mild, unspecified, pathological changes to marked cellular degeneration and some necrosis in the brain (Ashe et al. 1953). The more serious degenerative changes were observed at longer exposure durations (i.e., 8 and 11 weeks). Mild-to-m oderate pathological changes were revealed in the brains of rabbits exposed to a metallic mercury vapor concentration of 0.86 mg/m3 for 12 weeks (Ashe et al. 1953). The usefulness of these results is limited becau se the pathological changes are not specified and no distinction is made between primary and secondary e ffects (i.e., pathological changes secondary to induced shock). Two of 6 rabbits exposed to 4 mg/m3 metallic mercury vapor for 13 weeks exhibited slight tremors and clonus and had mercury concentrati ons of 0.8-3.7 \u00b5g/g wet tissue in the brain (Fukuda 1971). Following intermittent exposure to 3 mg/m3 for 12-39 weeks, rats exhibited a decline in conditioned avoidance response; however, no histopathological changes were evident (Kishi et al. 1978). The change wasMERCURY 65 2. HEALTH EFFECTS reversible within 12 weeks after exposure cessation and was associated with a decrease in the mercury concentration in brain tissue to below 10 \u00b5g/g we t weight (w/w). Mice exposed to an unspecified concentration of metallic mercury vapor intermitte ntly for more than 3 weeks exhibited progressive neurological dysfunction (i.e., wobb ling and unresponsiveness to light), beginning 22 days after initial exposure, and subsequently died 4 da ys later (Ganser and Kirschner 1985). No studies were located regarding neurological effect s in animals following chronic inhalation exposure to inorganic mercury. Organic Mercury. Exposure to organic mercury via inhalation is extremely rare. The only reports of even its potential occurrence come from a few case histories. Case reports have described neurological effects in humans after inhalation exposure to organic mercur y; however, no quantitative data were provided. Following acute inhalation exposure of dust containi ng methylmercury, four men had initial symptoms including numbness and tingling of limbs, unsteadiness in gait, difficulty in performing fine movements (e.g., buttoning a shirt), irritability, and constricted vi sion (Hunter et al. 1940). At least 2 years after these occupational exposures, the subjects had not fully recovered from their symptoms. Acute high-level exposure to an unspecified alkyl mercury compound has reportedly caused neurological symptoms (e.g.,ataxia, unsteady gait, slurred speech, memory difficu lties, tremors) in exposed workers (Hook et al. 1954; Lundgren and Swensson 1949). A case study reporting neurological effects in a boy af ter exposure to mercury vapor released from paint containing phenylmercuric acetate (Aronow et al. 1990) was discussed under metallic mercury because theexposure was to metallic mercury vapors released from the paint. Dimethylmercury is extremely volatile, and extremel y toxic (in the 5 mg/kg body weight range). The following case history describes an accidental death due to an occupational spill of only a few drops ofdimethylmercury. The primary exposure route is thought to have been dermal, but dimethylmercury is so volatile that inhalation exposure might also have occu rred. Blayney et al. (1997) provided the first account of this tragic event. The case history was subsequen tly detailed by Nierenberg et al. (1998). The exposure occurred to a 48-year-old female chemistry prof essor who was admitted to the hospital 5 months (154 days) after, as best as can be determined, sh e inadvertently spilled several drops (estimated at 0.4-0.5 mL, about 1,500 mg) of dimethylmercury from the tip of her pipette onto the back of her disposable latex gloves. The spill was cleaned and th e gloves disposed of. Hair analysis on a long strand MERCURY 66 2. HEALTH EFFECTS of hair revealed that after a brief lag time, mercur y content rose rapidly to almost 1,100 ppm (normal level, <0.26 ppm; toxic level, >50 ppm), and then slowly declined with a half-life of 74.6 days. These results support the occurrence of one or several episodes of exposure, and are consiste nt with laboratory notebook accounts of a single accidental exposure. Testing of fa mily members, laboratory coworkers, and laboratory surfaces failed to reveal any unsuspected mercury sp ills or other cases of toxic blood or urinary mercury levels. Permeation tests subsequently performed on dis posable latex gloves similar to those the patient had worn at the time of the lone exposure revealed that dimethylmercury penetrates such gloves rapidly and completely, with penetration occurring in 15 seconds or less and perhaps instantly. Polyvinyl chloride gloves were equally permeable to dimethylmercury. Five days prior to hospital admission, the patient developed a progressive deterioration in balance, gait, and speech. During the previous 2 months, she had experienced brief episodes (spaced weeks apart) of nausea, diarrhea, and abdominal discomfort, and had lost 6.8 kg (15 lb). Medical examination reveal ed moderate upper-extremity dysmetria, dystaxic handwriting, a widely based gait, and \"mild scanning speech .\" Routine laboratory test results were normal. Computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance im aging (MRI) of the head were normal except for the incidental finding of a probable meningioma, 1 cm in diameter. The cerebrospinal fluid was clear, with aprotein concentration of 42 mg/dL and no cells. A pr eliminary laboratory report indicated that the whole- blood mercury concentration was more than 1,000 \u00b5g/L (normal range, 1-8 \u00b5g/L; toxic level, >200 \u00b5g/L). Chelation therapy with oral succimer (10 mg/kg ora lly every 8 hours) was begun on day 168 after exposure. Whole blood concentrations rose to 4,000 \u00b5g/L after one day of chelation, and urinary mercury levels were 234 \u00b5g/L (normal range, 1-5 \u00b5g/L; toxic level, >50 \u00b5g/L ). Despite the initial success of chelation therapy, administration of vitamin E, and a blood exchange transfusion, at 176 days postexposure, the patient became comatose. Further aggressive general support a nd chelation therapy failed, life support ws removed (following the patient's advance directive), and the patient died 298 days postexposure. Autopsy results revealed diffusely thin cortex of the cerebral hemispheres (to 3 mm), and extensive gliosis of the visual cortex around the calcarine fissure and the superior surf ace of the superior temporal gyri. The cerebellum showed diffuse atrophy of both vermal and hemispheri c folia. Microscope evaluation revealed extensive neuronal loss and gliosis bilaterally within the primar y visual and auditory cortices, with milder loss of neurons and gliosis in the motor and sensory cortices. There was widespread loss of cerebellar granular-cell neurons, Purkinje cells, and basket- cell neurons, with evidence of loss of parallel fibers in the molecular layer. Borgmann's gliosis was well developed and widespread. The highest NOAEL values and all reliable LOAEL va lues for neurological effects in each species and duration category are recorded in Table 2-1 and plotted in Figure 2-1.MERCURY 67 2. HEALTH EFFECTS 2.2.1.5 Reproductive Effects Metallic Mercury. No acute-duration exposure data were lo cated regarding reproductive effects in humans after inhalation exposure to metallic mercury. However, several studies found no effect on fertility following intermediate or chronic inhalation exposur e to metallic mercury in humans (Alcser et al. 1989; Cordier et al. 1991; Lauwerys et al. 1985). A retrosp ective cohort study reported that male workers in a U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) plant exposed for at least 4 months had urinary mercury concentrations of 2,144-8,572 \u00b5g/L (Alcser et al. 1989). This sample population showed no significant difference infertility compared to controls (unexposed workers); however, they were never monitored for elemental mercury exposure. In a questionnaire study assessing the fertility of male workers exposed to mercuryvapor from various industries (i.e., zinc-mercury amal gam, chloralkali, or electrical equipment product plants), there was no statistically significant differe nce in the number of children of the exposed group compared to a matched control group (Lauwerys et al. 1985). The concentration of mercury in the urine of these exposed workers ranged from 5.1 to 272.1 \u00b5g/g creatinine. No correlation was observed between prolactin, testosterone, luteinizi ng hormone, and follicle stimulating hormone levels and blood or urine mercury levels in male workers exposed to merc ury vapors (Erfurth et al. 1990; McGregor and Mason 1991). Also, no effect on the response of these hor mones to challenge with gonadotropin releasing hormone was observed (Erfurth et al. 1990). Although no effect on fertility was observed in exposed workers, an increase in the rate of spontaneous abortions was reported in association with increased me rcury concentrations in the urine of the fathers exposed to metallic mercury in chloralkali plants befo re the pregnancy (Cordier et al. 1991). There was a significantly increased risk of spontaneous abortion, at a rate of 18.4%, when fathers had more than 50 \u00b5g/L mercury in the urine, compared to a rate of 8.6% when fathers were unexposed. Sikorski et al. 1987) reported that women occupationally exposed to metallic mercury vapors (dentists and dental assistants) had more reproductive failures (spontaneous abortions, stillbirths, congenital malformations) and irregular, painful, or hemorrhagic menstrual disord ers than a control (unexposed) group of women. The reproductive difficulties and menstrual disorders were co rrelated with mercury levels identified in scalp and pubic hair collected from the women. It should be noted that this study has been recently severely criticized for what Larsson (1995) calls \"errone ous interpretation of results and distortion of conclusions.\" The Sikorski et al. (1987) paper is nonetheless presented in th is toxicological profile as part of the available published data on reported human merc ury exposure. Its presence here is based upon its publication in aMERCURY 68 2. HEALTH EFFECTS credible peer-reviewed international journal and is intended neither as endorsement nor condemnation of the data or conclusions in the 1987 paper. Rowland et al. (1994) report that 418 women with high exposure to mercury (i.e., female dental assistants) were less fertile than unexposed controls. In this study, the probability of conception with each menstrual cycle (called \"fecundability\" by the authors) in wome n who prepared 30 or more amalgams per week and who were evaluated as having 4 or more poor mercury- hygiene practices was 63% of the fecundity of the unexposed controls. Rowland et al. (1994) noted th at occupational groups with roughly the same potential for exposure often contain subjects whose actual expos ures are quite different, depending on their particular work environment and their work practices within that environment. For example, 20% of the women in the final sample in this study reported preparing mo re than 30 amalgams per week with 4 or more poor hygiene factors. Among the women preparing the same number of amalgams, this study found differencesin \"fecundability,\" based upon each dental assistant's reported number of poor mercury-hygiene factors. One peculiar observation, however, was that women de termined to have had low exposure to mercury in their dental occupation were found to be more fer tile than unexposed controls. The reason(s) for the observed U-shaped dose-response curve were not known. In animals, exposure to metallic mercury vapors causes prolongation of the estrous cycle. In a study by Baranski and Szymczyk (1973), female rats exposed via inhalation to metallic mercury (at an average of 2.5 mg/m 3, 6 hours a day, 5 days a week for 21 days) experienced longer estrous cycles than unexposed animals. In addition, estrous cycles during mercury exposure were longer than normal estrous cycles in thesame animals prior to exposure. Although the initial ph ase of the cycle was protracted, complete inhibition of the cycle did not occur. During the second and th ird weeks of exposure, these rats developed signs of mercury poisoning including restlessness, seizures, and trembling of the entire body. The authorsspeculated that the effects on the estrous cycle were caused by the action of mercury on the central nervous system (i.e., damage to the hypothalamic regions involved in the control of estrous cycling). Organic Mercury. No studies were located regarding reproductive effects in humans or animals after inhalation exposure to organic mercury. The highest NOAELs and all reliable LOAELs for reproductive effects in each species and duration category are recorded in Table 2-1 and plotted in Figure 2-1.MERCURY 69 2. HEALTH EFFECTS 2.2.1.6 Developmental Effects Metallic Mercury. No association was demonstrated between inhalation exposure of the father and increased rates of major fetal malformations or ser ious childhood illnesses in a retrospective cohort study of workers at a U.S. DOE plant (Alcser et al. 1989). A case study of a woman chronically exposed to an unde termined concentration of mercury vapor reported that her first pregnancy resulted in spontaneous a bortion, and her second resulted in the death of the newborn soon after birth (Derobert and Tara 1950). It is unclear whether the reproductive toxicity experienced by the woman was due to the mercury expos ure. However, after recovery from overt mercury poisoning, she gave birth to a healthy child. A woman occupationally exposed to mercury vapors for 2 years prior to pregnancy and thr oughout pregnancy was reported to have delivered a viable infant at term (Melkonian and Baker 1988). Urinary mercury in th e woman at 15 weeks of pregnancy was 0.875 mg/L (normal levels are approximately 0.004 mg/L). Also , a case report of a woman exposed to mercury vapors in her home during the first 17 weeks of pregnancy re ported that the woman delivered a normal child who met all developmental milestones (although the child was not formally tested for psychologicaldevelopment) (Thorpe et al. 1992). Although mercury exposure was not measured, the child was born with hair levels of 3 mg/kg (3 ppm) of mercury. This ha ir level is comparable to that observed in populations consuming fish once a week (WHO 1990) and suggests th at exposure in this case may have been relatively low. Exposure of neonatal rats to me tallic mercury vapor at 0.05 mg/m 3 for 1 or 4 hours a day for 1 week during a period of rapid brain growth (postpartum days 11-17) resulted in subtle behavioral changes when the rats were tested at 4 and 6 months of age (Fredriksson et al. 1992). Offspring of rats exposed for 1 hour/day showed increases in the time necessary to finish a task in the radial arm maze (spatial learning). Offspring of rats exposed for 4 hours a day showed increases in bot h the time to finish the task and in the number of errors committed. When tested for locomotor activity at 2 months, an increase in rearing was observed in the 4 hour/day group, but repeat testing at 4 months showed lower locomotor, rearing, and total activity than controls. The 1-hour/day exposure group show ed no difference from controls at 2 months, and increased activity and decreased rearing at 4 months when compared to controls. Three groups of 12 pregnant Sprague-Dawley ra ts were exposed by inhalation to 1.8 mg/m3 metallic mercury vapor on gestation days (Gd) 11-14 and 17-20 for 1 hour (\"low dose\") or 3 hours (\"high dose\"). MERCURY 70 2. HEALTH EFFECTS Hg/kg/day (\"high dose\"). At postpartum day 3, each litter was reduced to 4 male and 4 female offspring. No significant differences between the mercury-treated o ffspring and the controls were observed for surface righting, negative geotaxis, pinna unfolding, and t ooth eruption. Tests of spontaneous motor activity (locomotion, rearing, rearing time, and total activ ity) showed that the mercury-treated offspring were hypoactive at 3 months of age; at 14 months, only total activity differed between exposed and control groups. In spatial learning tasks, exposed offspring showed retarded acquisition in the radial-arm maze but no differences in the circular-swim maze. A simple t est of learning, habituation to a novel environment (activity chambers), indicated a reduced ability to adap t. The authors conclude that prenatal exposure to mercury vapor results in behavior changes in the offs pring similar to those reported for methylmercury. On postpartum days 3-4, the mercury contents in the br ain, liver, and kidneys were 0.001, 0.004, and 0.002 mg Hg/kg, 0.053, and 0.033 mg Hg/kg, respectively, for animals exposed for 1 hour a day; and 0.012, 0.112, and 0.068 mg Hg/kg, respectively, for animals exposed for3 hours a day (Danielsson et al. 1993). Four groups of 12 pregnant Sprague -Dawley rats were exposed to methylmercury or elemental mercury alone or in combination as follows: (1) administ ered 2 mg/kg/day exposed by inhalation to 1.8 mg/m 3 metallic mercury (elemental mercury) vapor for 1.5 hours per day during Gd 14-19; (3) exposed to both meth ylmercury by gavage mg/kg/day, Gd Gd 14-19) (methylmercury + elemental mercury); or (4) given combined vehicle administration for each of the 2 treatments (control). The inhalation regimen corresponded to an approximate dose of 0.1 mg Hg/kg/ day. At postpartum day 3, each litter was reduced to 4 male offspring. There were no differences betw een any of the groups in maternal body weight gain before parturition. No differences in body weight, pi nna unfolding, tooth eruption, surface righting reflex, and negative geotaxis were observed in the offspri ng. Offspring of dams exposed to elemental Hg showed hyperactivity in the spontaneous motor ac tivity test chambers over all three parameters: locomotion, rearing, and total activity; this effect was potentiated in the animals of the methylmercury + elemental Hg group. In the swim maze test, the methylmercury + elemental mercury and elemental mercury groups evidenced longer latencies to reach a submerged platform, which they had learned to mount the day before, compared to either the contro l group or the methylmercury group. In the modified enclosed radial-arm maze, both the methylmercury + elemental Hg and elemental Hg groups showed more ambulations and rearings in the activity test prior to the learning test. During the learning trial, the same groups(i.e., methylmercury + elemental Hg and elemental Hg) showed longer latencies a nd made more errors in MERCURY 71 2. HEALTH EFFECTS acquiring all eight pellets. Generally, the results i ndicate that prenatal exposure to elemental mercury causes alterations to both spontaneous and learned be haviors, suggesting some deficit in the adaptive functions of the rats. Co-exposure to methylmercury, which by itself did not alter these functions at the dose given in this study, served to aggravate the ch anges significantly. Brain mercury concentrations in offspring were 1 ng/g w/w in the controls, 4 ng/g in the methylmercury group, 5 ng/g in the elemental Hggroup, and 12 ng/g in the methylmercury + elemental Hg group (Fredriksson et al. 1996). Adult female rats were exposed to metallic mercury vapor at 2.5 mg/m 3 for 3 weeks prior to fertilization and during Gd 7-20 (Baranski and Szymczyk 1973). A decrease in the number of living fetuses was observedin these dams compared to unexposed controls, and all pups born to the exposed dams died by the sixth day after birth. However, no difference in the o ccurrence of developmental abnormalities was observed between exposed and control groups. The cause of d eath of the pups in the mercury-exposed group was unknown, although an unspecified percentage of the deat hs was attributed by the authors to a failure of lactation in the dams. Death of pups was also obser ved in another experiment in which dams were only exposed to the same dose level prior to fertilization, supporting the conclusion that high mortality in the first experiment was due, at least in part, to the poor health of the mothers. Without further information, this study must be considered inconc lusive regarding developmental effects. Newland et al. (1996) studied the offspring of pr egnant squirrel monkeys exposed to 0.5 or 1 mg/m 3 of mercury vapor for 4 or 7 hours per day, 5 days per week during the last two-thirds or more of the gestation period. One female and 2 male offspring came from mothers exposed to 0.5 mg/m3 mercury vapor during gestation weeks 5-19, 5-21, or 6-22 for a total of 247-510 hours, resulting in total doses of1,304-2,900 \u00b5g (20-38 \u00b5g/day); and 3 male offspring came from mothers exposed to 1 mg/m 3 mercury vapor during gestation weeks 7-21, 3-18, or 8-21 for a total of 283-402 hours, resulting in total doses of 2,901-4,305 \u00b5g (42-62 \u00b5g/day). Five male offspring born about the same time as the exposed monkeysserved as controls. Lever pressing was maintained under a Concurrent Random-Interval 30 schedule of reinforcement. Time allocation on each lever was exam ined during behavioral transitions and in a steady state. Median maternal blood levels ranged from 0.025 to 0.09 \u00b5g/g in animals exposed to 0.5 mg/m 3 and from 0.12 to 0.18 \u00b5g/g in animals exposed to 1 mg/m3. No differences in birth weight, weight gain, or body weight at time of behavioral testing were ob served between exposed and control offspring. No difference in sensitivity to reinfor cer ratios was identified in the stead y state, but there was much more variability in the steady-state performance of exposed monkeys, as indicated by the standard deviation of the regression, than in controls. Logistic regression was used to examine the transition to new schedule MERCURY 72 2. HEALTH EFFECTS parameters. Exposed monkeys were found to produce sm aller or slower transitions than controls. The magnitude and stability of lever-press durations for c ontrols and exposed monkeys were indistinguishable early in the experiment, but at the end, the expo sed monkeys had longer lever-press durations and the session-to-session variability was much greater. One monkey's exposure began during the third week ofgestation (earlier than any of the others) and its behavi or was so erratic that some of the analyses could not be accomplished. Long-term effects of prenatal me rcury vapor exposure included instability in lever-press durations and steady-state performance under concurre nt schedules of reinforcement as well as aberrant transitions (Newland et al. 1996). Organic Mercury. No studies were located regarding developmental effects in humans or animals after inhalation exposure to organic mercury. The highest NOAELs and all reliable LOAELs for de velopmental effects in each species and duration category are recorded in Table 2-1 and plotted in Figure 2-1. 2.2.1.7 Genotoxic Effects There is inconclusive evidence that occupational expos ure to metallic mercury and to organic and inorganic mercury compounds, primarily through inhalation, causes structural and numerical chromosome aberrations in human lymphocytes. In one study, significant increases in the frequency of acentric fragments (chromosome breaks) occurred in 4 workers exposed to high concentrations of metallic mercury and in 18 workers exposed to a mixture of mercuric chloride, methylmercuric chloride, Mercury concentra tions in the workplace ranged from 0.15 to 0.44 mg/m 3; the urinary excretion level of mercury for both exposed groups was .890 \u00b5g/L. The findings of this study are suspect because the control group was not ma tched for sex, smoking habits, or sample size. Additionally, one of the four individuals in the me tallic mercury group had a history of benzene poisoning, which was reflected in the unusually high frequency of abnormal chromosome morphology seen in this individual. No difference in the incidence of ane uploidy was found between the exposed workers and the controls. In an earlier study, an apparent associa tion between increased chromosome aberrations and workplace exposure to mercury (as measured by urinary mercury levels) was reported (Verschaeve et al.1976). However, the study was not well controlled (i .e., not matched for sex, smoking habits, or sample size), and the only significant increase in structural ab errations occurred in the three workers exposed to ethylmercury. Significant increases in aneuploid were also noted for the exposure groups compared to the MERCURY 73 2. HEALTH EFFECTS control subjects. However, these data should also be interpreted with caution sin ce age has an influence on aneuploidy, and in this study, there was a general trend toward a higher incidence of aneuploidy in the older exposed workers (ages 36-63 years). It is noteworth y that in a subsequent study performed by these investigators (Verschaeve et al. 1979), no adverse eff ects on the structure or number of chromosomes were demonstrated in 28 subjects exposed to moderate levels of metallic mercury (urinary levels of 50 \u00b5g/L). The authors concluded that the results from thei r 1976 study, showing an association between increased chromosomal aberrations and occupational exposure to me rcury, may have been affected by factors other than exposure to mercury compounds. No increased frequency of structural aberrations w as found in 22 workers exposed to mercury vapors; no information was provided on numerical aberrations (M abille et al. 1984). The mean duration of exposure was 4 years, and the mean urinary and blood mercury levels in the exposed group were 117 \u00b5g/g creatinine and 0.031 \u00b5g/mL, respectively. More recently, peri pheral lymphocytes from 26 male chloralkali workers exposed to mercury vapors (25-50 \u00b5g/m3), for a mean exposure time of 10 years, were analyzed for micronucleus induction. The results were compar ed to results obtained from 26 unexposed subjects (Barregard et al. 1991). Groups were matched for ag e (\u00b17 years) and smoking habits; plasma, erythrocyte, and urine mercury levels were determined. Parallel lymphocyte cultures from each donor group were incubated in the presence of pokeweed mitogen, which stimulates both B- and T-lymphocytes, and phytohemagglutinin, which primarily activates T-cells. The analysis showed no significant increase in the frequency or the size of micronuclei in the exposed ve rsus the control group. Nor was there a correlation between micronuclei induction and plasma, erythrocyte, or urinary levels of mercury. Within the exposed group, however, there was a significant correlation be tween micronuclei induction in phytohemagglutinin- stimulated lymphocytes and cumulative exposure (whol e-blood mercury level over employment time); the response was independent of age or smoking habits . These results, suggesting a genotoxic effect on T-lymphocytes, are unusual since there is evidence th at B-lymphocytes may be more sensitive indicators of chemically induced clastogenesis than T-lymphocytes (H \u00f6gstedt et al. 1988). The authors stated that the evidence of a genotoxic response confined to T- lymphocytes could have been a random finding but hypothesized that long-term exposure to mercury may cause an accumulation of cytogenetic effects. Similarly, there was no correlation between urinar y mercury levels (60-245 \u00b5g/L) or the duration of exposure (11-34 years) and increased frequency of st ructural aberrations and micronuclei in the lymphocytes of 29 male workers exposed to mercury fulminate (Anwar and Gabal 1991). From the overall MERCURY 74 2. HEALTH EFFECTS results, the authors concluded that mercury in the manufacturing process may not have been the clastogen. Other genotoxicity studies are discussed in Section 2.5. 2.2.1.8 Cancer Metallic Mercury. There is no evidence from epidemiological studies that indicates inhalation of metallic mercury produces cancer in humans (Cragle et al. 1984; Kazantzis 1981). No evidence of an association between metallic mercury exposure and cancer mortality was found in a group of workers employed in a facility utilizing the metal in a lithium isotope separa tion process (Cragle et al. 1984). Overall mortality in the mercury-exposed group was less than that of the st andard white male population and that of a control group of men who were not exposed to mercury. Si milarly, no excess of cancer of the kidneys or nervous system was found among a cohort of 674 Norwegian men exposed to mercury vapors for more than 1 yearat 2 chloralkali plants (Ellingsen et al. 1993). An excess in lung cancer (type not specified) was found in Swedish chloralkali workers 10 years after the end of long-term, high-level exposure to metallic mercury (Barregard et al. 1990). However, these workers had al so been exposed to asbestos. Furthermore, no data on smoking status was provided, although the study implied that the workers did not smoke much. No studies were located regarding cancer in anim als after inhalation exposure to metallic mercury. Organic Mercury. Associations were reported between the use of mercury-containing fungicides (i.e., mercury levels in hair) and leukemia in farmers a nd between the use of mercury-containing seed dressings and leukemia in cattle (Janicki et al. 1987). Howeve r, the study was limited in reporting methodology used to conduct this study. Furthermore, the study did not adequately address exposure to other chemicals, or adjust for other leukemia risk factors. No studies were located regarding cancer in anim als after inhalation exposure to organic mercury. 2.2.2 Oral Exposure The bulk of the information regarding toxicity resu lting from oral exposure to inorganic mercury comes from studies of mercuric chloride. However, a few studi es are also available on the effects of oral exposure to mercuric acetate, mercurous chloride (calomel), and mercuric sulfide (cinnabar). Discussion of these MERCURY 75 2. HEALTH EFFECTS compounds has not been separated in this section, but the specific inorganic compound responsible for any effect is noted both in the text and in Table 2-2 and Figure 2-2. Health effects following oral exposure to organic me rcury were observed in humans and animals. The majority of the studies used to derive the NOAELs and LOAELs shown in Table 2-3 and Figure 2-3 concern exposure to methylmercuric chloride; however , in several exposure methylmercuric hydroxide, methylmercuric dicyanidiamide, or phenylmercuric acetate. discussed together in Table 2-3 and Figure 2-3. In order to facilitate a comparison of studiesusing different compounds of mercury (either organic or inorganic), all doses are expressed in terms of the mercury exposure (mg Hg/kg/day) rather than to th e mercury compound (HgX or RHgX/kg/day) to which one is exposed. For example, a dose of 1 mg/kg (whe n the compound is methylmercuric chloride) refers to mg/kg mercury rather than 1 mg/kg methylmercuric chloride. 2.2.2.1 Death Inorganic Mercury. A lethal dose mercuric chloride was estimated to be 10-42 mg Hg/kg for a 70-kg adult (Gleason et al. 1957). Death from oral exposure to inorganic mercury is usually caused by shock, cardiovascular collapse, acute renal failure, and sev ere gastrointestinal damage (Gleason et al. 1957; Murphy et al. 1979; Troen et al. 1951). Eighteen cases of human poisoning (suicide attempts in some cases) were reported by Troen et al. (1951); 9 patient s died following oral ingestion of single doses of mercuric chloride (range, 29->50 mg Hg/kg). The most common findings in these cases were gastro-intestinal lesions (e.g., mild gastritis to severe necr otizing ulceration of the mucosa) and renal involvement (e.g., albuminuria, anuria, and uremia). Death of a 50-year-old woman due to ingestion of an unspecified amount of mercurous chloride in Chinese medicine has also been reported (Kang-Yum and Oransky 1992). The death was attributed to renal failure. In rats, the oral LD 50 values (lethal dose, 50% kill) ranged from 25.9 to 77.7 mg Hg/kg as mercuric chloride (Kostial et al. 1978). The signs of acute mercury toxic ity in animals were similar to those described above for humans. Male rats appeared to be slightly more sensitive to the lethal effects of mercuric chloride; 2 of 5 male rats and no female rats died when given gavage doses of 14.8 mg Hg/kg, 5 days a week for 2 weeks (Dieter et al. 1992; NTP 1993). Mice showed slightly l ess toxicity, with no deaths at 14.8 mg Hg/kg, death in 1 male at 29 mg Hg/kg, and deaths in 5 of 5 males and 4 of 5 females at 59 mg Hg/kg when administeredby gavage over the same period (NTP 1993).MERCURY 104 2. HEALTH EFFECTS Chronic exposure to mercuric chloride resulted in incr eased mortality in male rats at 1.9 mg Hg/kg/day but no increase in mortality in female rats at up to 3.7 mg Hg/kg/day or in either male or female mice at up to 7.4 mg Hg/kg/day (NTP 1993). Renal lesions in the male rats were thought to contribute to the early deaths in these animals. The highest NOAEL values and all reliable LOAEL valu es for death for each species and duration category are recorded in Table 2-2 and plotted in Figure 2-2 for inorganic mercury. Organic Mercury. The acute lethal dose of organic mercury compounds for humans is difficult to assess from the available literature. Death resulting from or ganic mercury ingestion has been amply documented following outbreaks of poisoning (Minamata disease) after consumption of methylmercury-contaminatedfish in Minamata, Japan (Tsubaki and Takahashi 1986) and after consumption of grains contaminated with methyl- and ethylmercury in Iraq (Al-Saleem and the Clinical Committee on Mercury Poisoning 1976; Bakir et al. 1973). Death occurred in two boys who ate meat from a butchered hog that had been fed seedtreated with ethylmercuric chloride (Cinca et al. 1979). However, primarily because of the delay between mercury consumption and the onset of symptoms, the amount of organic mercury ingested in these cases isdifficult to determine. Fatal doses estimated from tissue concentrations range from 10 to 60 mg/kg (EPA 1985b). A case-control study examining the cause of d eath for patients with Minamata disease compared to the cause of death in unexposed persons showed that those patients who died prior to 1970 had significantly increased noninflammatory diseases of the nervous system; Minamata disease was reported as theunderlying cause of death (Tamashiro et al. 1984). For this group, pneumonia and nonischemic heartdisease were reported as prominent secondary cause of d eath. For those patients who died between 1970 and 1980, significant increases in Minamata disease were reported as the primary cause of death. Nonischemic heart disease correlated with the incide nce of Minamata disease, and noninflammatory central nervous system disease was a prominent secondary cause of death in this group. Methylmercury toxicity is very strain- and sex-specific in mice. A single oral dose of methylmercuric chloride at 16 mg Hg/kg resulted in the death of 4 of 6 male mice (C57BL/6N Jcl strain) but no deaths infemales (Yasutake et al. 1991b). No increase in mortality was observed in female mice until 40 mg Hg/kgwas administered, at which dosage 4 of 6 females died . Twenty-six weeks of dietary exposure to methyl- mercuric chloride resulted in increased mortality in both male and female mice (ICR strain) at3.1 mg Hg/kg/day (Mitsumori et al. 1981). Chronic (104 weeks) dietary exposure to methylmercuric MERCURY 105 2. HEALTH EFFECTS chloride resulted in increased deaths in male mice (B6C3F1 strain) at 0.69 mg Hg/kg/day but no increased mortality in females at up to 0.60 mg Hg/kg/day (Mitsumori et al. 1990). The highest NOAEL values and all reliable LOAEL valu es for death for each species and duration category are recorded in Table 2-3 and plotted in Figure 2-3 for organic mercury. 2.2.2.2 Systemic Effects Ingestion of mercury compounds has been associated w ith systemic toxicity in both humans and animals. As with inhalation exposure to meta llic mercury vapor, the major target organs of toxicity following oral exposure to inorganic and organic mercury are the ki dneys and the central nervous system, respectively. Available information is limited mainly to that c oncerning exposure to mercuric chloride and methyl- mercuric chloride. Oral exposure to mercury, especia lly the organic mercury form, has also been observed to result in adverse developmental effects in humans and experimental animals. A discussion of thedifferences in the toxicities of metallic mercury, inorganic compounds, and orga nic compounds of mercury is presented in Section 2.5. The systemic effect s observed after oral exposure are discussed below. The highest NOAEL values and all reliable LOAEL va lues for systemic eff ects for each species and duration category are recorded in Table 2-2 and plotted in Figure 2-2 for inorganic mercury, and recorded in Table 2-3 and plotted in Figure 2-3 for organic mercury. Respiratory Effects Inorganic Mercury. Extremely limited information was located regarding respiratory effects in humans after oral exposure to inorganic forms of mercur y. A 35-year-old man who swallowed an unknown amount of mercuric chloride had severe pulmonary edema a nd required artificial ventilation (Murphy et al. 1979). Fine rales were detected in a 19-month-old boy who sw allowed powdered mercuric chloride (Samuels et al. 1982). A 50-year-old female who ingested 5 tablets of a Chinese medicine that contained an unspecifiedamount of mercurous chloride (Kang-Yum and Or ansky 1992) experienced shortness of breath. The only study located regarding respiratory effects in animals after oral exposure to inorganic mercury described forceful and labored breathing, bleeding from the nose, and other unspecified respiratory MERCURY 106 2. HEALTH EFFECTS difficulties in Long-Evans rats after dietary exposur e to 2.2 mg Hg/kg/day as mercuric chloride for 3 months (Goldman and Blackburn 1979). Organic Mercury. Limited information was located regarding respiratory effects in humans after oral exposure to organic mercury. Two boys who died after eating meat from a hog that had eaten seed treatedwith ethylmercuric chloride developed bronchopneumoni a and edematous alveolitis, and required artificial ventilation (Cinca et al. 1979). Bronchopneumonia was also identified as the cause of death in four adultsand one infant who died as the result of methylme rcury poisoning in Iraq duri ng 1972 (Al-Saleem and the Clinical Committee on Mercury Poisoning 1976). It is unclear whether these respiratory effects were theresult of direct effects on the respiratory system or were secondary to other effects. The only information located regarding respiratory effect s in animals after oral exposure to organic mercury comes from a study in which rats were exposed to methylmercuric chloride in the diet for 2 years (Verschuuren et al. 1976). This study showed no treat ment-related histopathological lesions in the lungs of exposed rats at 0.1 mg Hg/kg/day. Cardiovascular Effects Inorganic Mercury. Cardiovascular toxicity has been observe d following ingestion of mercuric chloride and mercurous chloride in humans. The majority of the information regarding cardiovascular effects comes from reports of children who were treated with me rcurous chloride tablets for worms or mercurous chloride-containing powders for teething discomf ort (Warkany and Hubbard 1953). These authors described multiple cases in which tachycardia and elev ated blood pressure were observed in the affected children. The only information located regarding cardiovascular effects in humans after ingestion of mercuric chloride comes from a case study of a 22- year-old who attempted suicide by ingesting approximately 20 mg Hg/kg as mercuric chloride (Chugh et al. 1978). An electrocardiogram showed no P wave, prolongation of the QRS segment, and a high T wave. The authors suggested that thesecardiovascular effects were secondary to severe hyperkalemia. Exposure of rats to 28 mg Hg/kg/day as mercuric ch loride for 180 days in drinking water resulted in an increase in blood pressure, a decrease in cardiac contractility, and no effect on heart rate (Carmignani et al.1992). The increase in blood pressure was attributed to a vasoconstrictor effect, and the decrease in contractility was attributed to the direct toxic effect of the mercury on the cardiac muscle. Slightly MERCURY 107 2. HEALTH EFFECTS different results were obtained followi ng 350-day exposure of a different stra in of rats to 7 mg Hg/kg/day as mercuric chloride in drinking water (Boscolo et al . 1989; Carmignani et al. 1989). In the chronic study, positive inotropic response, increased blood pressure and cardiac contractility, and decreased baroreceptor reflex sensitivity were observed. The investigators suggested that the mechanis m for the cardiac effects in the chronic study involved the release of norepinephrine from presynaptic nerve terminals. Evidence of this release was provided by the fact that mercury ad ministration reduced the cardiovascular response to bretylium (which blocks presynaptic release of th e neurotransmitter norepinephrine) but not tyramine (which releases neurotransmitter from nerve terminals). Organic Mercury. Electrocardiography in four family members who ate meat from a hog that had consumed seed treated with ethylmercuric chloride had abnormal heart rhythms (ST segment depressionand T wave inversion) (Cinca et al. 1979). Death of th e two children in the family was attributed to cardiac arrest, and autopsy of these boys showed myocarditis . Cardiovascular abnormalities were also observed in severe cases of poisoning in the Iraqi epidemic of 1956, when widespread poisoning resulted from eating flour made from seed grains treated with ethylmercury p-toluene sulfonanilide (Jalili and Abbasi 1961). These abnormalities pulse, occasionally with bradycardia, and electrocardiogramsshowing ventricular ectopic beats, prolongation of the Q-T interval, depression of the S-T segment, andT inversion. A decrease in heart rate was observed in male rats given 2 gavage doses of 12 mg Hg/kg as methylmercuric chloride (Arito and Takahashi 1991). An increase in sy stolic blood pressure was observed in male rats after daily oral gavage doses of 0.4 mg Hg/kg/day as me thylmercuric chloride for 3-4 weeks (Wakita 1987). This effect began approximately 60 da ys after initiation of exposure and pe rsisted for at least 9 months. No treatment-related histopathological changes were obser ved in the hearts of rats exposed to 0.1 mg Hg/kg/day as methylmercuric chloride in the diet for up to 2 years (Verschuuren et al. 1976). Gastrointestinal Effects Inorganic Mercury. Ingestion of metallic mercury results in negligible absorption and little effect on the gastrointestinal tract. The two case histories iden tified are unusual in that the dose levels could be reasonably well quantified. The first case history repor ted ingestion of 15 mL (204 g) of metallic mercury by a 17-year-old male storekeeper who swallowed me rcury from the pendulum of a clock (apparently out of curiosity rather than as a suicide attempt). On ad mission, and 24 hours later, he was symptom free, andMERCURY 108 2. HEALTH EFFECTS physical examination was normal. The patient complain ed of no gastrointestinal symptoms, and was treated with a mild laxative and bedrest (Wright et al. 1980). In a second and massive incidence of ingestion, a 42-y ear-old man who had spent much of his life (since the age of 13) repairing instruments that contained merc ury, intentionally ingested an estimated 220 mL (about 3,000 g) while repairing a sphygmomanometer (Lin and Lim 1993). Upon admission, the patient presented with significantly elevated mercury blood levels ( 103 \u00b5g/L, normal <10 \u00b5g/L) and urine levels (73\u00b5g/L, normal <20\u00b5g/L). In the previous 2 years he had de veloped mild hand tremors, forgetfulness, irritability, and fatigue. Only a mild abdominal discomfort and no hepatic complications were observed at admission. The neurological symptoms were attributed to the long occupational exposure to mercury and not to the recent acute exposure. The initial radiological exam ination showed a conglomeration of mercury globules in the fundus of the stomach and ascending colon, with fine metallic spots dispersed throughout the small intestine. Abdominal ultrasonography was normal. He was treated with immediate gastric lavage and cathartics. He also received D-penicillamine 1 g/day or ally for 7 days. Seven days later, there were only spots of metallic mercury in the ascending colon. By 2 weeks, most of the mercury had been excreted inthe feces and was measured at a total volume of 220 mL (this number was used to estimate the amountinitially ingested). The authors reported that systemic absorption appeared low, based on the return to low levels of mercury in the urine and blood over the 10 days of monitoring following the exposure. A subsequent evaluation 6 months later reveal ed no further gastrointestinal involvement. Ingestion of mercuric chloride is highly irritating to the tissues of the gastrointes tinal tract. Blisters and ulcers on the lips and tongue and vomiting were observe d in a 19-month-old boy who ingested an unknown amount of mercuric chloride powder (Samuels et al. 1982) . Similarly ingestion of a lethal dose of mercuric chloride by a 35-year-old man resulted in vomiting, diarrhea, colicky abdominal pain, oropharyngeal pain, and ulceration and hemorrhages throughout the length of the gastrointestinal tract (Murphy et al. 1979). Ingestion by a woman of 30 mg Hg/kg as mercuric ch loride resulted in severe abdominal pain, diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting (Afonso and deAlvarez 1960). Another report of an attempted suicide by a 22-year-old reported ulceration of the mouth and thro at and bloody vomit after ingestion of approximately 20 mg Hg/kg (Chugh et al. 1978). Because of vomiting, the actual effective dose was unknown. Reports of ingestion of mercurous chloride have not found similar caustic effects; however, a 50-year-old woman who ingested an unspecified amount of merc urous chloride in a Chinese medicine experienced nausea and vomiting (Kang-Yum and Oransky 1992). Se veral children who were treated with mercurousMERCURY 109 2. HEALTH EFFECTS chloride for constipation, worms, or teething di scomfort had swollen red gums, excessive salivation, anorexia, diarrhea, and/or abdominal pain (Warkany and Hubbard 1953). Inflammation and necrosis of the glandular stomach were observed in mice that were given oral doses of 59 mg Hg/kg as mercuric chloride 5 days a week fo r 2 weeks (NTP 1993). In a 2-year gavage study, an increased incidence of forestomach hyperplasia was observed in male rats exposed to 1.9 or 3.7 mg Hg/kg/day as mercuric chloride compared to the control group. Organic Mercury. Case studies of individuals who were orally exposed to alkyl mercury compounds (unspecified form) reported diarrhea, tenesmus, irrita tion, and blisters in the upper gastrointestinal tract (Lundgren and Swensson 1949). Ingestion of meat from a hog that was fed seed treated with ethylmercuricchloride resulted in vomiting in two of the family members (Cinca et al. 1979). No quantitative data were available. Ingestion of flour made from seed grains that had been treated with ethylmercury p-toluene sulfonanilide also commonly resulted in abdominal pain and vomiting, diarrhea, or constipation (Jalili and Abbasi 1961). Pfab et al. (1996) reported a case of a 44-year-old man who ingested 83 mg/kg Thiomersal in a suicide attempt (5 g/60 kg). Thiomersal is a widely used alkyl-aryl-organomercurial bactericide. The man developed gastritis, renal tubular failure, dermatitis, gingivitis, delirium, coma, polyneuropathy, and respiratory failure. Treatment was symptomatic pl us gastric lavage and the oral chelation with dimercaptopropane sulfonate and dimercaptosuccinic aci d. The patient's condition was at its worst on day 17; however, the patient recovered completely (after several months). Maximum mercury concentrations were: blood, 14 mg/L; serum, 1.7 mg/L; urine, 10.7 mg/L; and cerebrospinal fluid, mg/L. Mercuryconcentration in blood declined with two velocities: firs t with a half-time of 2.2 days, then with a half-time of 40.5 days. The decline of mercury concentration in blood, urinary mercury excretion, and renal mercury clearance were not substantially influenced by chelation therapy. Exposure of rats to phenylmercuric acetate for 2 years resulted in necrosis and ulceration of the cecum at doses as low as 4.2 mg Hg/kg/day in drinking water; no effect was observed at 1.7 mg Hg/kg/day in thefeed (Fitzhugh et al. 1950; Solecki et al. 1991). Mice showed ulceration of the glandular stomach after2 years of dietary exposure to methylmercuric chlori de at 0.69 mg Hg/kg/day (Mitsumori et al. 1990). In contrast, no treatment-related histopathological lesions in the stomach or jejunum were observed in rats exposed via the diet to 0.1 mg Hg/kg/day as methylmercuric chloride (Verschuuren et al. 1976).MERCURY 110 2. HEALTH EFFECTS Hematological Effects Inorganic Mercury. Information is limited regarding hematol ogical effects in humans after ingestion of inorganic mercury. The only information located regarding hematological effects in humans was the reportof anemia that developed (probably secondary to massi ve gastrointestinal hemorrhaging) in a 35-year-old man who ingested a lethal amount of mercuric chlori de (Murphy et al. 1979). Bone marrow activity in the afflicted man was normal, but thrombocytopenia was also observed. Groups of 10 female Sprague-Dawley ra ts were administered a single gavage dose of mercuric chloride at 7.4 or 9.2 mg Hg/kg in water and necropsied at 14 days postexposure. Blood samples were analyzed for hemoglobin concentration, hematocrit value, erythrocyt e counts, total and differential leukocyte counts, and platelet counts. Serum was analyzed phosphatase, uric acid, and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). There were no effects on body weight, and weights of other organs were not affected. Significant decreases in hemoglobin, erythrocyt es, and hematocrit were also reported. There was a significant decrease in serum protein and calcium in the low-dose mercury group only. Mercury wasfound mainly in the kidneys (12.6 and 18.9 ppm at the low and high dose, respectively), but trace amountswere also detected in the liver, brain, and serum (Lecavalier et al. 1994). No other studies were located regarding hematological effects in animals after oral exposure to inorganic mercury. Organic Mercury. No studies were located regarding hematological effects in humans after oral exposure to organic mercury. Rats that received phenylmercuric acetate in their drinking water for 2 years showed decreases in hemoglobin, hematocrit, and red blood cell counts at a dose of 4.2 mg Hg/kg/day (Solecki et al. 1991). The anemia observed in this study may have been seconda ry to blood loss associated with the ulcerative lesions in the large intestine seen at this dose (see Gastrointestinal Effects above). No treatment-related changes were observed in hematological parameters measured in rats (strain not specified) exposed via the diet for 2 years to 0.1 mg Hg/kg/day as methylmercuric chloride (Verschuuren et al. 1976).MERCURY 111 2. HEALTH EFFECTS Musculoskeletal Effects Inorganic Mercury. A single case report was identified that found evidence of skeletal muscle degeneration (markedly elevated serum aldolase, LDH, and creatinine phosphokinase; and the presence ofpigment granular casts and myoglobin in the urine) in a 22-year-old man who ingested 2 g of mercuric chloride in an attempt to commit suicide (Chugh et al. 1978). Several children who were treated with mercurous chloride for constipation, worms, or teething discomfort experienced muscle twitching or cramping in the legs and/or arms (Warkany and Hubbard 1953). The muscular effects were probably secondary to changes in electrolyte balance (i.e., potassi um imbalance due to fluid loss or renal wasting). No studies were located regarding musculoskeletal e ffects in animals after oral exposure to inorganic mercury. Organic Mercury. Autopsy of one of two boys who died af ter eating meat from a hog that had consumed seed treated with ethylmercuric chloride showed mu scle wasting (Cinca et al. 1979). This effect was probably secondary to neurotoxicity. Electromyogra phy in the two surviving members of the family showed no abnormalities. Musculoskeletal effects ob served in Iraqis poisoned by consuming flour made from grains treated with ethylmercury p-toluene sulfonanilide included deep skeletal pain and muscle twitching or fasciculations (Jalili and Abbasi 1961). It is likely that these effects were secondary to effects on the nervous system. No treatment-related histopathological changes in skelet al muscle were observed in rats exposed via the diet for 2 years to 0.1 mg Hg/kg/day as methylmercuric chloride (Verschuuren et al. 1976). Hepatic Effects Inorganic Mercury. Limited information was located regarding hepatic effects in humans who ingested inorganic mercury. A 35-year-old man who ingested a lethal dose of mercuric chloride became jaundicedand exhibited elevated AST, alkaline phosphatase, L DH, and bilirubin (Murphy et al. 1979). An autopsy revealed an enlarged and softened liver. Hepatic enlargement was also observed in a 19-month-old boy who ingested an unknown amount of powdered me rcuric chloride (Samuels et al. 1982). Limited information was located regarding the hepa tic effects of inorganic mercury in animals. MERCURY 112 2. HEALTH EFFECTS Groups of 10 female Sprague-Dawley rats were administered a single gavage dose of mercuric chloride at 7.4 or 9.2 mg Hg/kg in water and necropsied at 14 days postexposure. There were no effects on body or relative liver weights from mercuric chloride e xposure. LDH activity was significantly decreased in animals exposed to HgCl2 at both dose levels. Mercury was found mainly in the kidneys (12.6 and 18.9 ppm at the low and high dose, respectively), but trace amounts were also detected in the liver, brain, and serum (Lecavalier et al. 1994). Two intermediate-duration studies in rats showed biochemical changes following ingestion of mercuric chloride (Jonker et al. Rana and Boora hepatic lipid peroxidation and decreases in glutathione peroxidase were observed in rats orally exposed to an unspecified dose of mercuric chloride for 30 days (Rana and Boora 1992). In a 4-week ra nge-finding study, groups of 5 rats per sex (10 per sex for controls) received diets containing mercuric chlori de at 5, 10, or 20 mg Hg/kg/day in males and 5.5, 11.1, and 22.2 mg Hg/kg/day in females. Absolute liver weight decreased starting at the mid-dose group inmales and in the high-dose group in females (Jonker et al. 1993b). The liver weight significantly increasedin mice given 2.9 mg Hg/kg/day as mercuric chlori de in the drinking water for 7 weeks; however, no histopathological changes were observed (Dieter et al. 1983). Male rats administered mercuric chloride by gavage for 2 years showed a slight increase in acute he patic necrosis (11 of 50 ve rsus 4 of 50 in controls); however, it is unclear whether this increase was statistically significant (NTP 1993). Organic Mercury. Extremely limited information was also obtained regarding the hepatic effects of organic mercury exposure. An autopsy of four adults and four infants who died as the result of methyl- mercury poisoning in Iraq in 1972 reported fatty changes in the liver occurred in most cases (Al-Saleem and the Clinical Committee on Mercury Poisoning 1976). It is unclear whether these changes were the direct result of methylmercury on the liver or whether they were due to other causes. The prevalence of liver disease in a population from the Minamata area was not significantly increased when compared to unexposed controls (Futatsuka et al. 1992). No treatment-related changes were observed in hepatic parameters measured in rats exposed via the diet to 0.1 mg Hg/kg/day as methylmercuric chloride (Verschuuren et al. 1976).MERCURY 113 2. HEALTH EFFECTS Renal Effects Inorganic Mercury. The kidney appears to be the critical organ of toxicity for the ingestion of mercuric salts. Renal effects in humans have been observed following acute oral exposure to inorganic mercury. Acute renal failure has been observed in a number of case studies of mercuric chloride ingestion (Afonso and deAlvarez 1960; Murphy et al. 1979; Samuels et al. 1982). An autopsy of a 35-year-old man whoingested a lethal dose of mercuric chloride and e xhibited acute renal failure showed pale and swollen kidneys (Murphy et al. 1979). A case study reported acute renal failure characterized by oliguria, proteinuria, hematuria, and granular casts in a woman who ingested 30 mg Hg/kg as mercuric chloride(Afonso and deAlvarez 1960). Another case study reporte d a dramatic increase in urinary protein secretion by a patient who ingested a single dose of 15.8 mg Hg/kg as mercuric chloride (assuming a body weight of70 kg) (Pesce et al. 1977). The authors of the report surmised that the increased excretion of both albuminand 2-microglobulin was indicative of mercury-induced tubular and glomerular pathology. Acute renal failure that persisted for 10 days was also obser ved in a 19-month-old child who ingested an unknown amount of powdered mercuric chloride (Samuels et al. 1982). Decreased urine was observed in a 22-year-old who attempted suicide by ingesti ng approximately 20 mg Hg/kg (Chugh et al. 1978). Myoglobin and pigmented casts were observed in th e urine, and the authors suggested that these observations, in combination with a highly elevated level of serum creatine phosphokinase, indicated that rhabdomyolysis may have contributed to the renal failure. Ingestion of mercurous chloride has also resulted in renal toxicity in humans. Decreased urinary output and edema were observed in a 60-year-old woman who ing ested an unspecified amount of mercurous chloride in a Chinese medicine (Kang-Yum and Oransky 1992). Re nal failure was a contributing factor in the death of this woman. Renal failure also developed in tw o female patients who chronically ingested a mercurous chloride-containing laxative (Davis et al. 1974). Renal toxicity has been observed in Fischer 344 rats and B6C3F1 mice following acute-, intermediate-, and chronic-duration al. 1992; NTP 1993). In the 14-day study, male and female rats were expo sed by gavage to 0.93-14.8 mg Hg/kg/day as mercuric chloride for 5 days a week. There was a significant increase in the ab solute and relative kidney weights of males beginning at the 1.9-mg/kg/day dose level. An increased inciden ce of tubular necrosis was observed in rats exposed to at least 3.7 mg/kg/day; severity progressed with increasing dose levels. Increases in urinary levels ofalkaline phosphatase, AST, and LDH were also observe d at 3.7 mg Hg/kg/day; at 7.4 mg Hg/kg/day, MERCURY 114 2. HEALTH EFFECTS increased urinary -glutamyltransferase activity was also observed. Mice given a single gavage dose of 10 mg/Hg/kg as mercuric chloride showed minor renal tubular damage and rapid regeneration of the tubular epithelium (Nielsen et al. 1991). At 20 mg Hg/kg/day, the mice showed necrosis of the proximal tubules. Mice given gavage doses of mercuric chloride 5 days a week for 2 weeks showed an increase in absolute and relative kidney weights at 3.7 mg Hg/kg/day and acu te renal necrosis at 59 mg Hg/kg/day (NTP 1993). Groups of 10 female Sprague-Dawley ra ts were administered a single gavage dose of mercuric chloride at 7.4 or 9.2 mg Hg/kg in water and necropsied at 14 days postexposure. No effects on body weight or weights of other organs were found. Merc ury was found mainly in the kidneys (12.6 and 18.9 ppm at the low and high doses, respectively), but trace amounts were also detected in the liver, brain, and serum. Mild-to-moderate morphological changes, consisting of protei n casts, cellular casts, and interstitial sclerosis, were noted in the kidneys of HgCl 2-treated animals in both groups (Lecavalier et al. 1994). In a 4-week range-finding study, groups of 5 rats per sex (10 per sex for controls) received diets containing mercuric chloride at 5, 10, or 20 mg Hg/kg/day for ma les and 5.5, 11.1, and 22.2 mg Hg/kg/day for females. Nephrosis and proteinaceous casts in the kidneys we re observed in all groups (males and females) fed mercuric chloride. An increased number of epithelial ce lls in the urine was observed in males exposed at the low dose; however, this effect was not observed at hi gher dose levels and the authors noted that the effect could not be ascribed to treatment. The minimum-ne phrotoxic-effect level (MNEL) and the no-nephrotoxic- effect level (NNEL) for mercuric chloride in feed were determined to be 8 mg Hg/kg/day in males and 8.9 mg Hg/kg/day in females and 1 mg Hg/kg/day in males and 1.1 mg Hg/kg/day in females, respectively(Jonker et al. 1993b). In a follow-up study, 10-week Wistar fed mercuric at the MNEL and NNEL. In males, the MNEL resulted in the presence of ketones in urine and an increase in the relative weight of kidneys. Effects observed in females in the MNEL group included decreased density of urine and increased absolute and relative kidney wei ghts. Increased absolute and relative kidney weights were also seen in females at the NNEL. A few histopathological changes were found in the basophilic tubules in the outer cortex of the kidneys in 5 of 5 males and 1 of 5 females exposed to the MNEL (Jonker etal. 1993b). Similarly, male mice receiving mercuric chloride in drinking water for 7 weeks s howed slight degeneration of the tubular epithelial cells (nuclear swelling) at 2.9 mg Hg/kg/day and minimal renal nephropathy MERCURY 115 2. HEALTH EFFECTS (dilated tubules with either flattened eosinophilic epith elial cells or cytomegalic cells with foamy cytoplasm) at 14.3 mg Hg/kg/day (Dieter et al. 1983). In a 6-month exposure to 0.23-3.7 mg Hg/kg/day, a significant increase in severity of nephropathy (i.e., dilated tubules with hyaline casts, foci of tubular re generation, and thickened tubular basement membrane) was observed in Fischer 344 rats exposed to 0.93 mg/kg/ day of mercuric chloride compared to the controls (NTP 1993). The absolute and relative kidney weights were increased in males at 0.46 mg/kg/day. In B6C3F1 mice, the incidence and severity of cytoplasmic vacuolation of renal tubule epithelium increased in males exposed to at least 3.7 mg Hg/kg/day as mercuric chloride for 6 months (NTP 1993). Administrationof large doses of mercuric chloride (28 mg Hg/kg/day) in the drinking water for 6 months also resulted in focal degeneration of the tubular cells with decreased acid phosphatase in the lysosomes (indicative of the release of the lysosomal contents) (Carmignani et al. 1992) . Notably, at this dose, renal glomerular changes were also evident. The glomeruli showed hyperce llularity, and there was deposition of amorphous material in the mesangium; thickening of the basement membrane with IgM present was also observed. When a strain of mice (SJL/N) sensitive to the immunot oxic effects of mercury was given mercuric chloride in the drinking water at 0.56 mg Hg/kg/day for 10 week s, slight glomerular cell hyperplasia with granular IgG deposits in the renal mesangium and glomerular blood vessels were observed (Hultman and Enestrom 1992). No tubular necrosis was observed. In a 2-year study, male rats gavaged with 1.9 or 3.7 mg Hg/kg/day as mercuric chloride 5 days a week exhibited an incidence of marked nephropathy (describ ed as thickening of glomerular and tubular basement membranes and degeneration and atrophy of tubular ep ithelium) that was significantly greater in severity than in the control group (NTP 1993). In addition, the incidence of renal tubule hyperplasia was increased in the high-dose male rats. In the same study, the in cidence and severity of nephropathy were significantly greater in male and female mice gavaged with 3.7 and 7.4 mg Hg/kg/day as mercuric chloride 5 days a week than in the controls. Administration of 7 mg Hg/kg/da y as mercuric chloride to rats in the drinking water resulted in hydropic degeneration a nd desquamation of tubule cells (Carmignani et al. 1989). Electron microscopy showed lysosomal alterations in the pr oximal tubules and thickening of the basal membrane of the glomeruli.MERCURY 116 2. HEALTH EFFECTS Organic Mercury. Data on renal toxicity associated with ingestion of methylmercury in humans come from several case studies. An outbreak of ethylmercury fungicide-induced poisoning was reported by Jalili andAbbasi (1961). Affected individuals exhibited pol yuria, polydypsia, and albuminuria. Two boys who ingested meat from a hog that had consumed seed treat ed with ethylmercuric chloride also had increased blood urea, urinary protein, and urinary sediment (Cinca et al. 1979); an autopsy revealed nephritis. A13-month-old boy who ate porridge made from flour treated with an alkyl mercury compound (specific mercury compound not reported) experienced albuminur ia, red and white cells, and casts in the urine (Engleson and Herner 1952). In autopsies carried out to evaluate the cause of death in 4 adults and 4 infants from the Iraqi epidemic of 1972, one case exhibited tubular degeneration in the kidneys (whether an adult or child was not specified) (Al-Saleem and the Clinical Committee on Mercury Poisoning 1976). Organic mercury-induced nephrotoxicity has been dem onstrated in rodents following acute-, intermediate-, and chronic-duration exposure. The usefulness of results from subchronic studies may be limited because the pathological changes observed were often not di stinguished as primary or secondary effects (i.e., pathological changes secondary to induced shock). N onetheless, they provide some useful indication of potential effects. Administration of methylmercuric chloride to mice in a single gavage dose of 16 mg Hg/kg resulted in decreased renal function (decreased phenolsulfonphthalein excretion), increased plasma creatinine, and swelling of tubular epithelial cells, with exfoliation of the cells into the tubular lumen (Yasutake et al. 1991b). Although no effects were observed after a singl e gavage dose of 8 mg Hg/kg (Yasutake et al. 1991b), 5 daily gavage doses of 8 mg Hg/kg/day as methylme rcuric chloride in rats resulted in vacuolization in the proximal tubules with ongoing regeneration (Magos et al. 1985). Similar effects were observed after 5 doses of 8 mg Hg/kg/day as ethylmercuric chloride (Magos et al. 1985). In an intermediate-duration study, histopathological ch anges were observed in the kidneys of female rats exposed to 0.86, 1.68, or 3.36 mg Hg/kg/day as methylme rcury dicyanidiamide by gavage 5 days a week for 3-12 weeks (Magos and Butler 1972). The low-dose gr oup exhibited large foci of basophilic tubular epithelial cells, desquamation, fibros is, and inflammation in the renal cortex; however, no control group was used in the study (Magos and Butler 1972). A 12-week diet containing 0.08 mg Hg/kg/day as methyl-mercury caused ultrastructural (cytoplasmic masses bundles of smoothendoplasmic reticulum) in kidney proximal tubule cells of female rats, despite the normal appearance of the MERCURY 117 2. HEALTH EFFECTS glomeruli at the light microscopic level (Fowler 1972). The author concluded that these changes could be a result of metabolism to inorganic mercury and may account for proteinuria observed in exposed humans. Administration of methylmercuric chloride in the diet of mice for 26 weeks at a dose of 0.6 mg Hg/kg/dayresulted in degeneration of the proximal tubules charact erized by nuclear swelling and vacuolation of the cytoplasm (Hirano et al. 1986). Rats fed daily doses of phenylmercuric acetate for up to 2 years exhibited slight -to-moderate renal damage (e.g., tubular dilatation, atrophy, granularity, fibros is) (Fitzhugh et al. 1950). These effects were evident at doses (beginning at 0.02 mg Hg/kg/day) that were tw o orders of magnitude lower than those required to induce detectable effects in the mercuric acetate-treated rats (Fitzhugh et al. 1950). A NOAEL of0.005 mg Hg/kg/day was determined. The authors concluded that some of the histological changes werepresent to some degree in the control animals, suggesti ng that low levels of mercury apparently hasten the normal degenerative processes of the kidneys (see Inorga nic Mercury above). Problems in this study limit its usefulness in determining effect levels. Incr eased severity of renal nephrosis was also observed in another study in which rats were given 0.4 mg Hg/ kg/day as phenylmercuric acetate in the drinking water for 2 years (Solecki et al. 1991). Lower doses in this study were not tested. Mice given methylmercuricchloride in the diet at a dose of 0.13 mg Hg/kg/ day showed epithelial cell degeneration and interstitial fibrosis, with ongoing regeneration of the tubules presen t (Mitsumori et al. 1990); no effect was observed at 0.03 mg Hg/kg/day. Similar effects were seen in mice given methylmercuric chloride in the diet for 2 yearsat a dose of 0.11 mg Hg/kg/day (Hirano et al. 1986). Ra ts given methylmercuric chloride in the diet for 2 years at a dose of 0.1 mg Hg/kg/day had incr eased kidney weights and decreased enzymes (alkaline al. 1976). However, histopat hological examination revealed no treatment-related lesions. A 2-year study conducted with mercuric acetate in the feed of rats showed an increased severity of renal damage at doses of mercury as low as 2 mg Hg/ kg/day (Fitzhugh et al. 1950). Rats initially showed hypertrophy and dilation of the proximal convoluted tubules. At this stage, eosinophilia, rounding, and granular degeneration of the epith elial cells were observed. Occasionally basophilic cytoplasm and sloughing of the cells were observed. As the lesi on progressed, tubular dilation increased, and hyaline casts appeared within the tubules; fibrosis and inflammati on were observed. Finally, tubules appeared as cysts, and extensive fibrosis and glomerular changes were observed. However, this study was limited becauseMERCURY 118 2. HEALTH EFFECTS group sizes were small, survival data were not reporte d, and a considerable number of early deaths from pneumonia were noted. Endocrine Effects Inorganic Mercury. No studies were located regarding endocrine effects in humans after oral exposure to inorganic mercury. Several studies have reported effects on the thyroid after acute- or intermediate-duration exposure to mercuric chloride. An increase in iodine re lease from the thyroid was observed following gavage administration of 7.4 mg Hg/kg/day as mercuric chlori de to rats for 6 days (Goldman and Blackburn 1979). Serum levels of thyroid hormones (triiodothyronine a nd/or thyroxine) in mice decreased after administration of 6 mg Hg/kg/day as mercuric chloride or mercuric su lfide for 10 days by gavage (Sin et al. 1990). Similar effects were observed after 4 weeks of dosing with me rcuric sulfide (Sin and The 1992). Administration by gavage of 5.3 mg Hg/kg/day as mercuric chloride to rats for 40 days resulted in increased thyroid weight, thyroidal iodine uptake, and protein-bound iodine in the serum (Goldman and Blackburn 1979). Decreased triiodothyronine and monoiodotyrosine were also observed. Dietary exposure of rats to 2.2 mg Hg/kg/day as mercuric chloride for 3 months resulted in decreased thyroidal iodine uptake, release, and turnover (Goldman and Blackburn 1979). Adrenocortical function was eval uated in male rats exposed to 0, 9, 18, or 36 mg Hg/kg/day as mercuric chloride in drinking water for 60-180 days (Agraw al and Chansouria 1989). A significant increase in adrenal and plasma corticoste rone levels in all dose groups was observed after 120 days of exposure. After 180 days of exposure, corticosterone levels ha d returned to control values. The relative adrenal gland weight was significantly increased for all exposed groups compared to control values. In a 4-week range-finding study, groups of 5 rats per sex (10 per sex for controls) received diets containing mercuric chloride at 5, 10, or 20 mg Hg/kg/day in ma les and 5.5, 11.1, and 22.2 mg Hg/kg/day in females. The high dose resulted in an increased relative adrenal weight in males and a decreased absolute adrenal weight in females (Jonker et al. 1993b) Organic Mercury. No studies were located regarding endocrine effects in humans or animals after oral exposure to organic mercury.MERCURY 119 2. HEALTH EFFECTS Dermal Effects Inorganic Mercury. Limited information was located regarding dermal effects of inorganic mercury in humans. Several children who were treated with medications containing mercurous chloride for constipation, worms, or teething discomfort exhibited fl ushing of the palms of the hands and soles of the feet (Warkany and Hubbard 1953). The flushing was fre quently accompanied by itching, swelling, and desquamation of these areas. Morbilliform rashes, conjunctivitis, and excessive perspiration were also frequently observed in the affected children. Patch tests conducted in several children revealed that the rashes were not allergic reactions to the mercury. Kang-Yum and Oransky (1992) reported hives in a woman who ingested a Chinese medicine containing an unspecified amount of mercurous chloride, which suggestsan allergic response to the medicine. No studies were located regarding dermal effects in animals after oral exposure to inorganic mercury. Organic Mercury. Only a few studies were identified regarding dermal effects of organic mercury, however, the case history concerning dimethylmercury exposure is a very important alert to the hazards ofthis organomercurial. Blayney et al. (1997) originally reported the fata l case of a dimethylmercury exposure after a dermal exposure to an extremely small amount of materi al. The case history was subsequently detailed by Nierenberg et al. (1998). The exposure occurred to a 48-year-old female chemistry professor who was admitted to the hospital 5 months (154 days) after, as best as can be determined, she inadvertently spilled several drops (estimated at 0.4-0.5 mL; about 1,500 mg) of dimethylmercury from the tip of her pipetteonto the back of her disposable latex gloves. Th e spill was cleaned and the gloves disposed of. Hair analysis on a long strand of hair revealed that after a brief lag time, mercury content rose rapidly to almost 1,100 ppm (normal level, <0.26 ppm; toxic level, >50 ppm ), and then slowly declined with a half-life of 74.6 days. These results support the occurrence of one or several episodes of exposure, and are consistent with laboratory notebook accounts of a single accidental e xposure. Testing of family members, laboratory coworkers, and laboratory surfaces failed to reveal an y unsuspected mercury spills or other cases of toxic blood or urinary mercury levels. Permeation tests subsequently performed on disposable latex gloves similar to those the patient had worn at the time of the lone exposure revealed that dimethylmercury penetrates such gloves rapidly and completely, with penetration occurring in 15 seconds or less and perhaps instantly. Polyvinyl chloride gloves were equally pe rmeable to dimethylmercury. Five days prior to MERCURY 120 2. HEALTH EFFECTS admission, the patient developed a progressive deteri oration in balance, gait, and speech. During the previous 2 months, she had experienced brief episod es (spaced weeks apart) of nausea, diarrhea, and abdominal discomfort; and had lost 6.8 kg (15 lb). Medical examination revealed moderate upper- extremity dysmetria, dystaxic handwriting, a widely based gait, and \"mild scanning speech.\" Routinelaboratory test results were normal. Computed tom ography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head were normal except for the incidental finding of a probable meningioma, 1 cm in diameter. Thecerebrospinal fluid was clear, with a protein con centration of 42 mg/dL and no cells. A preliminary laboratory report indicated that the whole-blood mercur y concentration was more than 1,000 \u00b5g/L (normal range, 1-8 \u00b5g/L; toxic level, >200 \u00b5g/L). Chelation therapy with oral succimer (10 mg/kg orally every 8 hours) was begun on day 168 after exposure. Whole blood concentrations rose to 4,000 \u00b5g/L after one day of chelation, and urinary mercury levels were 234 \u00b5g/L (normal range, 1-5 \u00b5g/L; toxic level, >50 \u00b5g/L). Despite the initial success of chelation therapy, administration of vitamin E, and a bloodexchange transfusion, at 176 days postexposure, the patient became comatose. Further aggressive general support and chelation therapy failed, life support ws removed (following the patient's advance directive), and the patient died 298 days post expos ure. Autopsy results revealed di ffusely thin cortex of the cerebral hemispheres (to 3 mm), and extensive gliosis of th e visual cortex around the calcarine fissure and the superior surface of the superior temporal gyri. Th e cerebellum showed diffuse atrophy of both vermal and hemispheric folia. Microscope evaluation revealed exte nsive neuronal loss and gliosis bilaterally within the primary visual and auditory cortices, with milder loss of neurons and gliosis in the motor and sensory cortices. There was widespread loss of cerebellar gr anular-cell neurons, Purkinje cells, and basket-cell neurons, with evidence of loss of parallel fibers in the molecular layer. Bergmann's gliosis was well developed and widespread. In the only other organic mercury studies identified for dermal exposures, a study of a large group of people who consumed methylmercury-contaminated bread ove r a 1- to 3-month period showed a dose-related history of rashes (Al-Mufti et al. 1976). These may also have been allergic responses. A 13-month-oldchild who ingested porridge made from flour that had been treated with an alkyl mercury compound (specific mercury compound not reported) developed a measles-like rash, fever, and facial flushing (Engleson and Herner 1952). Also, Iraqis who consumed flour made from grain treated with ethylmercury p-toluene sulfonanilide exhibited skin lesions consisting of pruritus on the palms, soles, and genitalia (Jalili and Abbasi 1961). In severe cases, exfoliative derma titis of the hands and feet was also observed.MERCURY 121 2. HEALTH EFFECTS The only information located regarding dermal effects in animals after oral exposure to organic mercury comes from a study in which rats were exposed to methylmercuric chloride in the diet for 2 years (Verschuuren et al. 1976). No treatment-related lesi ons were observed upon histopathological examination of the skin of rats exposed to 0.1 mg Hg/kg/day. Ocular Effects Inorganic Mercury. No information was located regarding ocular effects in humans from ingestion of inorganic mercury. No studies were located regarding ocular effects in animals after oral exposure to inorganic mercury. Organic Mercury. No information was located regarding ocular effects in humans from ingestion of organic mercury. While visual effects result from meth ylmercury exposure, they are cortical in origin (see neurotoxicity below). The only report of ocular effects in animals after oral exposure to organic mercury comes from a study in which rats were exposed to methylmercuric chloride via the diet for 2 years (Verschuuren et al. 1976). No treatment-related lesions were observed upon histopathol ogical examination of the eyes of rats exposed to 0.1 mg Hg/kg/day. As in humans, the visual effects resulting from methylmercury exposure in primates areconsidered to be centrally mediated (Rice and Gilbert 1982, 1990). Body Weight Effects Inorganic Mercury. No information was located regarding body weight effects in humans from ingestion of inorganic mercury. A single dose of mercuric chloride administered to fe male Sprague-Dawley rats ( 10/group) at 7.4 or 9.2 mg Hg/kg in water resulted in no effects on body wei ght at 14 days postexposure (Lecavalier et al. 1994). However, a number of animal studies have reported decreases in body weight or body weight gain after ingestion of mercuric chloride (Chang and Hartma nn 1972a; Dieter et 1993). After a 4-week exposure to mercuric chloride in the food, male Wistar rats had a 21% body weight decrease at 10 mg Hg/kg/day, and female Wistar rats had a 27% d ecrease in body weight at 22.2 mg Hg/kg/day. NoMERCURY 122 2. HEALTH EFFECTS significant loss was observed at the next-lower-dose groups of 5 and 11.1 mg Hg/kg/day in males and females, respectively (Jonker et al. 1993b). Doses of 14.8 mg Hg/kg/day administered to rats 5 days a week for 2 weeks resulted in a 10% decrease in male body weight gain (NTP 1993). Much lower doses produced decreases in body weight gain whenadministered over longer periods. In rats, decreases in body weight gain of approximately 10% were observed with doses of 0.93 mg Hg/kg as mercuric chloride when administered by gavage 5 days a week for 6 months (NTP 1993). Mice were less sensitive, s howing no effect at 7.4 mg Hg/kg/day and a 26% decrease in body weight gain at 14.8 mg Hg/kg/day in the same study (NTP 1993). Organic Mercury. No information was located regarding body weight effects in humans from ingestion of organic mercury. A number of animal studies have reported decreases in body weight or body weight gain after ingestion of methyl or phenyl mercury. A 20-25% decrease in body we ight gain in male and female rats was observed after 5 gavage doses of 8 mg Hg/kg/day as methylmercuric chloride or ethylmercuric chloride In intermediate-duration studies with methylmercury, biologically significant decreases in bodyweight gain have been observed in rats after e xposure to doses as low as 0.8 mg Hg/kg/day for 6 weeks (Chang and Hartmann 1972a) and in mi ce after exposure to 1 mg Hg/kg/day for 60 days (Berthoud et al. 1976). No effect on female body weight gain was ob served after dietary exposure to 0.195 mg Hg/kg/day as methylmercuric chloride for 14 weeks (Lindstrom et al. 1991). A 2-year exposure to 0.4 mg Hg/kg/day as phenylmercuric acetate in the feed resulted in a 10% decrease in body weight gain in rats (Solecki et al. 1991). Gavage administration of methylmercuric chloride to rats for 2 days at 12 mg Hg/kg/day resulted in a persistent decrease in the body temperatur e of the rats (Arito and Takahashi 1991). Other Systemic Effects Inorganic Mercury. Several children who were treated with mercurous chloride contained in powders or tablets for constipation, worms, or teething discomfor t exhibited low-grade or intermittent fevers (Warkany and Hubbard 1953). No studies were located on other systemic effects in animals after oral exposure to inorganic mercury.MERCURY 123 2. HEALTH EFFECTS Organic Mercury. No studies were located regarding other syst emic effects in humans or animals after oral exposure to organic mercury. 2.2.2.3 Immunological and Lymphoreticular Effects Inorganic Mercury. No studies were located regarding immunological or lymphoreticular effects in humans after oral exposure to inorganic mercury. The immune response to mercury exposure is complex, depending in part on the dose of mercury and the genetic characteristics of the exposed population (see S ection 2.4). Administration of 14.8 mg Hg/kg/day as mercuric chloride to B6C3F1 mice 5 days a week for 2 weeks resulted in a decrease in thymus weight (NTP 1993), suggesting immune suppression. However, a 2-week exposure to 0.7 mg Hg/kg/day as mercuric chloride in the drinking water resulted in an increase in the lymphoproliferative response after stimulation with T-cell mitogens in a strain of mi ce particularly sensitive to the autoimmune effects of mercury (SJL/N) (Hultman and Johansson 1991). In contrast, a similar exposure of a strain of mice (DBA/2) not predisposed to the autoimmune eff ects of mercury showed no increase in lymphocyte proliferation. A significant suppression of the lymphoproliferative r esponse to T-cell mitogens, concanavalin A, and phytohemagglutinin was observed in male B6C3F1 mice administered 2.9 or 14.3 mg Hg/kg/day as mercuric chloride in drinking water for 7 weeks (Dieter et al. 1983). A significant decrease in the weight ofthe thymus and spleen and a decrease in antibody respon se were also exhibited at 14.3 mg Hg/kg/day. An increase in B-cell-mediated lymphoproliferation was, however, observed at both 2.9 and14.3 mg Hg/kg/day. No immunological effects were observed at the lowest dose of 0.57 mg Hg/kg/day. When SJL/N mice were administered mercuric chlori de in the drinking water for 10 weeks, an increase in circulating antinucleolar antibodies was observed at 0.28 mg Hg/kg/day, and deposition of granular IgG deposits was observed in the renal mesangium a nd glomerular blood vessels at 0.56 mg Hg/kg/day (Hultman and Enestrom 1992). In rats, immune deposits have b een observed in the basement membrane of the intestines and kidneys following gavage exposure to 2.2 mg Hg/kg/day as merc uric chloride twice weekly for 2 months, although no functional changes were evident in these ti ssues (Andres 1984). The observation of these deposits suggests that autoimmunity to specific components of these tissues has developed.MERCURY 124 2. HEALTH EFFECTS The highest NOAEL values and all reliable LOAEL valu es for immunological and lymphoreticular effects in each species and duration category are recorded in Table 2-2 and plotted in Figure 2-2 for inorganic mercury. Organic Mercury. No studies were located regarding immunological effects in humans after oral exposure to organic mercury. In BALB/c mice administered a diet containing 0.5 mg Hg/kg/day as methylmercury for 12 weeks, the thymus weight and cell number decreased by 22 and 50%, respectively, compared to the control group (Ilback 1991). The natural killer cell activity was reduced by 44 and 75% in the spleen and blood, respectively. However, the lymphoproliferative respon se in the spleen increased at this dose of mercury. The LOAEL value for immunological and lymphoreticular effects in mice for intermediate-duration oral exposure to organic mercury is recorded in Table 2-3 and plotted in Figure 2-3. 2.2.2.4 Neurological Effects Inorganic Mercury . The oral absorption of metallic mercury is negligible, and even massive doses have not resulted in neurological effects. The wo case hist ories identified are unusual in that the dose levels could be reasonably well quantified. The first case hi story reported ingestion of 15 mL (204 g) of metallic mercury by a 17-year-old male storekeeper who swallowed mercury from the pendulum of a clock (apparently out of curiosity rather than as a suicid e attempt). On admission, and 24 hours later, he was symptom free, and physical examination was normal. The patient complained of no gastrointestinal symptoms, and was treated with a mild laxative and be d rest. The results of serial daily urine mercury estimates were normal (all less than 15 \u00b5g) and did not suggest significant absorption. The radiologicalinvestigation illustrated a characteristic pattern of fine ly divided globules of mercury in the gastrointestinal tract (Wright et al. 1980). The second and massive incidence of ingestion involved a 42-year-old man who had spent much of his life (since the age of 13) repairing instruments that containe d mercury. He intentionally ingested an estimated 220 mL (or about 3,000 g) while repairing a sphygmom anometer (Lin and Lim 1993). Upon admission, the patient presented with significantly elevated merc ury blood levels (103 \u00b5g/L, normal <10 \u00b5g/L) and urine levels (73 \u00b5g/L, <20 \u00b5g/L). In the previ ous 2 years he had developed mild hand tremors, MERCURY 125 2. HEALTH EFFECTS forgetfulness, irritability, and fatigue. The occupa tional exposures made it difficult to determine any additional neurological effects from the acute exposur e. There was no history of peripheral neuropathy, vertigo, insomnia, or muscular weakness. Neurops ychiatric and psychology evaluations indicated poor concentration and a defect in recent memory. EEG results indicated diffuse cortical dysfunctionpredominantly on the left hemisphere. He was treated with immediate gastric lavage and cathartics. He also received D-penicillamine 1 g/day orally for 7 days. Blood and urine merc ury levels obtained 3 days after chelating therapy were 116.9 and 22.9\u00b5g/L, resp ectively. By 2 weeks postexposure, most of the mercury had been excreted in the feces and was measured at a total volume of 220 mL (this number wasused to estimate the amount initially ingested). The patient was lost to follow-up, but returned to the hospital 6 months later (for glycemic control), at wh ich time examination revealed a lessening of his hand tremors. Most case studies of neurotoxicity in humans induced by oral exposure to inorganic mercury salts have reported neurotoxic effects as the result of ingestion of therapeutic agents that contain mercurous chloride (e.g., teething powders, ointments, and laxatives). Several children treated with tablets or powders containing mercurous chloride exhibited irrita bility, tendon re flexes, and/or confusion (Warkany and Hubbard 1953). A 4-year-old boy who had been given a Ch inese medicine containing mercurous chloride for 3 months developed drooling, dys phagia, irregular arm movements, and impaired gait (Kang-Yum and Oransky 1992). Davis et al. (1974) reported that tw o women developed dementia and irritability due to chronic ingestion of a tablet laxative that contai ned 120 mg of USP-grade mercurous chloride (0.72 mg Hg/kg/day, assuming an average body weight of 70 kg). One woman had taken 2 tablets daily for 25 years,and the other woman took 2 tablets daily for 6 years. Both patients died from inorganic mercury poisoning, and at autopsy, low brain weight and volume and a reduced number of nerve cells in the cerebellum were seen. Light microscopic analysis revealed granules of mercury within neuronal cytoplasm. Electronmicroscopy revealed mercury deposits in some neurons. In addition, neurotoxicity has been observed after ing estion of lethal doses of mercuric chloride. Blurred vision and diplopia were reported by a 35-year-old ma n who ingested a lethal dose of mercuric chloride (Murphy et al. 1979). Prior to death, the man expe rienced repeated seizures. An autopsy revealed abscesses on the occipital lobe and cerebellum.MERCURY 126 2. HEALTH EFFECTS Acute- and intermediate-duration studies describing neurotoxic effects in animals following exposure to inorganic mercury salts are limited. A study w as conducted by Chang and Hartmann (1972b) in which mercuric chloride was administered both by gavage and subcutaneously. Evidence of disruption of the blood-brain barrier (i.e., leakage of dye into the brain tissue) was observed 12 hours after a single dose of0.74 mg Hg/kg as mercuric chloride in rats (Chang and Hartmann 1972b). investigators also administered 0.74 mg Hg/kg/day as mercuric chloride to rats for up to 11 weeks. Within 2 weeks, there were coagulative or lucid changes in cerebellar granule cells and fragmentation, vacuolation, and cytoplasmic lesions in the neurons of dorsal root ga nglia. Neurological disturbances consisted of severe ataxia and sensory loss, with an accompanying loss in body weight. No conclusions regarding the oral neurotoxicity of mercuric chloride can be drawn from the results of this study because the discussion of the results observed in the study did not clearly differen tiate whether the effects were observed as the result of oral or subcutaneous exposure. It is expected that mercuric chloride administered subcutaneously would be much more toxic than that administered orally b ecause of the very poor absorption of inorganic forms of mercury from the gastrointestinal tract. Dietary exposure of rats to 2.2 mg Hg/kg/day as mercur ic chloride for 3 months resulted in inactivity and abnormal gait (Goldman and Blackburn 1979). However, it is unclear whether the effects observed in this study were the direct result of effects on the nervous system, or whether they may have been secondary toother toxic effects. No evidence of neurotoxicity (c linical signs of neurotoxic ity and optic and peripheral nerve structure) was seen in mice administered 0.74 or 2.2 mg Hg/kg/day as mercuric chloride in the drinking water for 110 days (Ganser and Kirsc hner 1985). The investigators increased the dose administered to the low-dosed animals to 7.4-14.8 mg Hg/kg/day for an additional 400 days; however, still no neurotoxic effects were observed. Similarly, no histopathological evidence of brain lesions was observed in rats receiving gavage doses of mercuric ch loride as high as 3.7 mg Hg/kg/day 5 days a week for up to 2 years or in mice receiving gavage doses as high as 7.4 mg Hg/kg/day 5 days a week for up to2 years (NTP 1993). The highest NOAEL values and all reliable LOAEL va lues for neurotoxic effects in each species and duration category are recorded in Table 2-2 a nd plotted in Figure 2-2 for inorganic mercury. Organic Mercury. Most of the information concerning neur otoxicity in humans following oral exposure to organic mercury comes from reports describing the effects of ingesting contaminated fish or fungicide-treated grains (or meat from animals fed such grai ns). Information about doses at which the effects MERCURY 127 2. HEALTH EFFECTS occurred is frequently limited because of difficulti es in retracing prior exposure and uncertainties in estimating dose levels based on assumed f ood intake and contamination levels. Although isolated instances of alkyl mercury poisoning have been reported (Cinca et al. 1979; Engleson and Herner 1952), the epidemic poisonings in Japan and Iraq focused attention on the neurotoxicity of these compounds. The first reported widespread outbreak of neurological disorders associated with the ingestion of methylmercury-contaminated fish occurred in the Minamata area of Japan (Kutsuna 1968). Theneurological syndrome was characterized by a long list of symptoms including prickling, tingling sensationin the extremities (paresthesia); impaired peripheral vision, hearing, and smell; slurred speech; Elevated concentrations of methylmercury were observed in the hair and brains of victims (see Secti on 2.5). Epidemics of similar neurological disorders were reported in Iraq in 1956 and 1960 (Bakir et al . 1973; Jalili and Abbasi 1961) as the result of eating flour made from seed grain treated with ethylmercury p-toluene sulfonanilide. Affected individuals had an inability to walk, cerebellar ataxia, speech difficulties, paraplegia, spasticity, abnormal reflexes, restriction of visual fields or blindness, tremors, paresthesia, insomnia, confusion, halluci nations, excitement, and loss of consciousness. In the winter of 1971-1972 in Iraq, more than 6,530 patients required hospitalization and 459 deaths occurred, usually due to central nervous system damage, after the ingestion of contaminated bread prepared from wheat and other cereals treated with a methylmercury fungicide (Bakir et al. 1973). Al-Mufti et al. (1976) attempted to correlate symp toms of the poisoning incident with an estimate of methylmercury intake based on average levels found in grain and self-reported estimates of the number of loaves ingested. A number of assumptions were made in the estimates, and there were logistical constraints in surveying the widely spread rural population in Iraq. Moreover, only a total mercury intake was derived and compared with the results of a clinical evaluati on and a survey for symptoms. Nonetheless, interesting and useful results were reported based on the 2,147 pe ople surveyed. The mean period of exposure for the Iraqi population exposed to contaminated bread was 32 days, with some people consuming the bread for as long as 3 months. A mean of 121 loaves per person was eaten; the maximum was 480 loaves. Based on themean number of loaves, the total intake of methyl mercury was estimated at between 80 mg and 250 mg. However, those who had consumed the most loaves ma y have ingested up to 1,000 mg of methylmercury over a 3-month period. Of those with symptoms of alkylmercury poisoning at the time of the survey(October 1972-May 1973), 80% had eaten more than 100 lo aves. Of the 75 people who had reported eating more than 200 loaves, 53 (71%) presented with some evidence of poisoning. The incidence rate forMERCURY 128 2. HEALTH EFFECTS poisoning was estimated at 271 per 1,000; this includes a mortality of 59 per 1,000, a severe disability rate of 32 per 1,000, a rate of mild or moderate disability of 41 per 1,000; and a rate for those with only a subjective evidence of poisoning of 138 per 1,000. Based on estimates of total intake, dose-related increases were observed in the incidence and severity of paresthesia, astereognosis (loss of the ability to judge the form of an object by touch), persistent pain in the limbs, persistent headaches, difficulty walking, difficulty using the arms, and changes in speech, sight, and hearing. The most commonly observedsymptom was paresthesia, most frequently involving the extremities but also on the trunk and thecircumoral region. Difficulty walking and a feeli ng of weakness were the next most common symptoms. The total estimated intake in total milligrams associat ed with the four categories (no evidence of poisoning, subjective evidence, mild to moderate evidence, a nd severe symptoms) is as follows for all ages combined (number of persons in parentheses): 95 mg (n=59), 141 mg (n=131), 160 mg (n=35), 173 mg (n=22). This dose range is small for such dramatically different health states, and does not widen when the data are evaluated by age group. Interestingly, the total in take associated with severity of symptoms decreases on a mg/kg body weight basis with increasing age in contrast with what would be expected if children were more susceptible. For example, intakes (mg/kg over the to tal exposure period) associated with severe symptoms are as follows for the age groups 5-9 years, 10-14 years, and 15 years and older, respectively: mg/kg(n=9), 4 mg/kg (n=7), and 3.6 mg/kg (n=6). Compar able numbers are for the mild/moderate symptoms and the subjective symptoms (shown): 6 mg/kg (n=19), 3.4 mg /kg (n=20), and 2.4 mg/kg (n=92). It is possible that child sensitivity may not be as large a factor wh en exposures reach the levels experienced in Iraq. Neurotoxic effects seen in the Minamata (Japan) and Iraqi poisonings have been associated with neuronal degeneration and glial proliferation in the cortical and cerebellar gray matter and basal ganglia (Al-Saleem and the Clinical Committee on Mercury Poisoning 1976), and derangement of basic developmental processes such as neuronal migration (Choi et al. 1978; Matsumoto et al. 1965) and neuronal cell division (Sager et al. 1983). In the brain, Purkinje, basket, a nd stellate cells were severely affected. Granule cells were variably affected. Sural nerves removed from two women with neurotoxicity associated with the Minamata incident also showed evidence of periphe ral nerve degeneration and regeneration (Miyakawa et al. 1976). Similar effects have been observed in persons inges ting meat contaminated with ethylmercuric chloride (Cinca et al. 1979). Neurotoxic signs observed in two boys who ultimately died as the result of theexposure included gait disturbance, ataxia, dysarthri a, dysphagia, aphonia, EFFECTS spasticity, mydriasis, horizontal nystag mus, agitation, and coma. Electroencephalography showed decreased alpha activity and increased slow-w ave activity. Autopsy showed nerve cell loss and glial proliferation in the cerebral in cerebellum, a nd motor neuron loss in the ventral horns of the spinal cord. Neurotoxic signs in the surviving family memb ers were generally similar (ataxia, gait impairment, spasticity, drowsiness, intentional tremor, agitation, hypoesthesia in the limbs, speech difficulties, and visual disturbances); all but the narrowing of the visu al fields resolved after termination of exposure. A New Mexico family, including a pregnant woman, a 20-year-old female, and 2 children (a 13-year-old male and an 8-year-old female) ate meat from a hog inadvertently fed seed grain treated with a fungicidecontaining methylmercury and experienced severe, delayed neurological effects (Davis et al. 1994). Several months after the exposures, the children deve loped symptoms of neurological dysfunction. The newborn child of the exposed mother showed signs of central nervous system disorder from birth. Twenty- two years after the 3-month exposure period, the peopl e who were 20 and 13 years old at time of exposure had developed cortical blindness or constricte d visual fields, diminished hand proprioception, choreoathetosis, and attention deficits. MRI examina tion of these two revealed residual brain damage in the calcarine cortices, parietal cortices, and cerebellum. The brain of the person who was exposed at age 8 (who died of aspiration pneumonia with a superimposed Klebsiella bronchopneumonia and sepsis at age 29) showed cortical atrophy, neuronal loss, and gliosis, mo st pronounced in the paracentral and parieto-occipital regions. Regional brain mercury le vels correlated with the extent of brain damage. The youngest ( in utero at the time of exposure) developed qua driplegia, blindness, severe mental retardation, choreoathetosis, and seizures, and died at age 21. The inorganic mercury le vels in different regions of the brain of the 29-year- old patient ranged from 82 to 100% of the total merc ury present. Since inorganic mercury crosses the blood-brain barrier poorly, biotransformation of th e methylmercury to inorganic mercury may have occurred after the methylmercury crossed the blood-br ain barrier, accounting for its observed persistence in the brain and its possible contribution to the brain damage. LeBel et al. (1996) studied early nervous system dysfunction in Amazonian populations exposed to low levels of methylmercury. A preliminary study w as undertaken in two villages on the Tapajos River, an effluent of the Amazon, situated over 200 km downs tream from the methylmercury extraction areas. The study population included 29 young adults $35 years (14 women and 15 men) randomly chosen from a previous survey. Hair analyses were conducted w ith cold vapor atomic fluorescence spectrophotometry. Total hair Hg (THg) varied between 5.6 \u00b5g/g and 38. 4 \u00b5g/g, with MeHg levels from 72.2% to 93.3% of MERCURY 130 2. HEALTH EFFECTS the THg. A quantitative behavioral neurophysiologi cal test battery, designed for use under standard conditions in an area without electricity and for persons with minimal formal education was administered to all participants. The results of visual testing show ed that although all particip ants had good near and far visual acuity, color discrimination capacity (Lanthony D-15 desaturated panel) decreased with increasing THg (F=4.1; p=0.05); near visual contrast sensitivity profiles (Vistech 6000) and peripheral visual field profiles (Goldman Perimetry with Targets I and V) were reduced for those with the highest levels of THg. For the women, manual dexterity (Santa Ana, Hels inki version) decreased with increasing THg (F=16.7; p<0.01); this was not the case for the men. Although the women showed a tendency towards reduced grip strength, muscular fatigue did not vary with THg for either sex. The authors claim that this studydemonstrates that it is possible, using a sensitive test battery, to detect alterations in nervous system functions, consistent with knowledge of Hg toxicity, at levels be low the currently recognized threshold of 50 \u00b5g/g THg. Mental retardation has not generally been reported as a neurotoxic effect of alkyl mercurial exposure in adults. However, a 9-month-old infant who recei ved porridge made from alkyl mercury-contaminated grains for approximately 4 months lost the ability to crawl or walk and exhibited persistent mental retardation (Engleson and Herner 1952). These effects ar e similar to those seen in infants born to mothers who consumed methylmercury-contaminated food duri ng pregnancy (see Section 2.2.2.6), suggesting that in addition to the prenatal period, infancy may also be a susceptible period for the development of these types of effects. Studies in experimental animals also indicate that organic mercury is a potent neurotoxicant. Adult female monkeys (Macaca fascicularis) were exposed to methylmercury (0.050 mg Hg/kg/day) in apple juice by mouth for 6, 12, or 18 months, or 12 months followe d by 6 months without exposure (clearance group). A fifth group of monkeys was administered mercuric chloride (0.200 mg Hg/kg/day) by constant-rate intravenous infusion through an in-dwelling catheter for 3 months. Controls were housed and handled with the exposed monkeys, but were not administered merc ury. The number of neurons, astrocytes, reactive glia, the calcarine sulcus was estimated by use of the optical volume fractionator stereology tec hnique. Reactive glia showed a significant increase in number for every treatment group, increasing 72% in th e 6-month, 152% in the 12-month, and 120% in the groups, and the numbe r of reactive glia in the clearance group remained elevated (89%). In the mercuric chloride group, there was a 165% showed no significant change in number in MERCURY 131 2. HEALTH EFFECTS any exposure group. The methylmercury-treated monke ys (all groups) appeared normal in terms of cage behavior throughout the entire exposure period, supporti ng the conclusion that there was no significant loss in the neuron population. Examination of tissue sampl es did not reveal any apparent degradation in the structure of neurons or chronic changes in the glial cells (e.g., the appearance of hypertrophic astrocytes), which are commonly observed following exposure to high le vels of mercury. No apparent dilation of the perivascular spaces was observed. The average volume of the cortex of the calcarine sulcus did not differ significantly from controls for any methylmercury-treated group. The methylmercury-clearance group hadlow levels of methylmercury present in tissues; however , the level of inorganic mercury was also elevated. The astrocytes and microglia in the methylmercury group contained the largest deposits of inorganic mercury. Comparing the results of the methylmercury and inorganic mercury groups suggests thatinorganic mercury may be responsible for the increase in reactive glia (Charleston et al. 1994). Charleston et al. (1996) studied the effects of long-term subclinical exposure to methylmercury on the number cells and pericytes within the thalamus from the left side of the brain of the monkey Macaca fascicularis. These parameters were determined by use of the Optical Volume Fractiona tor stereological method. The accumulated burden of inorganic mercury (IHg) within these same cell types h as been determined by autometallographic methods. Four groups of female monkeys (n=4-5) were exposed to 50 \u00b5g Hg/kg/day methylmercury in apple juice for 6, 12, or 18 months, or 12 months followed by 6 m onths without exposure (clearance group). One control animal each was sacrificed with the 6- and 12-m onth exposure groups, and two additional animals were sacrificed at the end of the experiment. All monkeys appeared normal\u2014no changes in behavior or motor skills were observed. Hematological function (white blood cell count and differen tiation, erythrocyte count, hemoglobin, hematocrit, and red cell indices) and blood chemistry (urea nitrogen, creatine, bilirubin, albumin, total protein, alkaline phosphatase, and electroly tes) were normal. No weight loss was observed. Neurons, oligodendrocytes, endothelia, and pericytes did not show a significant change in cell number for any exposure group. Astrocyte cell number exhibited a significant decline for both the 6-month (44.6%) and clearance exposure groups (37.2%); decreased ast rocyte counts were also observed in the other exposure groups, but these were not significant. The microglia, in contrast, showed a significant increase inthe 18-month (228%) and clearance exposure groups (162%). Results from mercury speciation and quantification analysis of contralateral matched sampl es from the thalamus of the right side of the brain from these same monkeys indicated that methylmercury concentrations plateaued at around 12 monthsexposure, whereas the inorganic levels, presumabl y derived from demethylation of methylmercury, continued to increase throughout all exposure durati ons. Autometallographic determination of theMERCURY 132 2. HEALTH EFFECTS distribution of IHg by cell type indicates that bot h the astrocytes and microglia contain substantially elevated IHg deposits relative to all other cell types. The data suggest that the inorganic mercury present in the brain, accumulating after long-term subclinical me thylmercury exposure, may be a proximate toxic form of mercury responsible for the changes with in the astrocyte and microglial populations. Rice (1996a) evaluated delayed neurotoxicity produ ced by methylmercury in monkeys treated with methylmercury from birth to 7 years of age. When these monkeys reached 13 years of age, individualsbegan exhibiting clumsiness not present previously. Further exploration revealed that treated monkeys required more time to retrieve treats than di d nonexposed monkeys and displayed abnormalities on a clinical assessment of sense of touch in hands and feet, d espite the fact that clinical examinations performed routinely during the period of dosing had not yielde d abnormal results. Another group of monkeys, dosed from in utero to 4 years of age, also took longer to retrieve treats when assessed years after cessation of exposure. These observations were pursued in both groups of monkeys by objective assessment of somatosensory function in the hands: both groups of m onkeys exhibited impaired vibration sensitivity. The results suggest that a delayed neurotoxicity occurre d when these monkeys reached middle age. The author notes persons with Minamata disease also have sympto ms of delayed neurotoxicity. The results from a study of more than 1,100 Minamata patients over the age of 40 indicated a difficulty in performing dailyactivities that increased as a function of age compared to matched controls. Methylmercury may represent the only environmental toxicant for which there is good evidence for delayed neurotoxicity observable many years after cessation of exposure. Rice (1996b) further compares the sensory and cognitive effects of developmental methylmercury exposure in monkeys to the effects in rodents. Developmen tal exposure to methylmercury in the Macaque monkey produced impairment of function in the visual, auditory , and somatosensory systems. In addition, delayed neurotoxicity was observed in monkeys years after cessation of dosing, manifested as overall clumsiness and slowness in reaching for objects. The effects of developmental methylmercury exposure on cognitive function in monkeys are more equivocal; both positive and negative results have been obtained, with no obvious pattern with regard to possible domains of impairment. Prenatal methylmercury exposure in rodents produced retarded development and impairment of motor function, while the evidence for cognitive impairment is less consistent. Derivation of refe rence doses based on these data from monkeys and rodents is remarkably congruent, and is virtually identical to values derived from evidence for developmental impairment in humans. Research needs include determ ination of neurotoxic effects at lower body burdensMERCURY 133 2. HEALTH EFFECTS in the monkey, including dose-effect data, and a more systematic exploration of the pattern of behavioral deficits in both primates and rodents. Gilbert et al. (1996) used fixed interval/fixed ratio performance in adult monkeys to evaluate effects from exposure in utero to methylmercury. The fixed interval/fixed ratio (FI/FR) schedule is considered to be a sensitive indicator of neurotoxicity. In the present study, monkeys ( Macaca fascicularis ) were exposed in utero to methylmercury. Maternal doses of methylmercury of 0, 50, 70, or 90 \u00b5g/kg/day (in apple juice) (n=11, 9, 2, and 2, respectively) resulted in in fant blood mercury levels at birth ranging from 1.04 to 2.45 ppm. Monkeys were tested on a multiple FI/FR schedule of reinforcement at 8-10 years of age. FourFI/FR cycles were run per session. Pause time and run rate were calculated for FI and FR components, as well as FI quarter-life and local FI response rates. Methylmercury treatment and sex effects wereinvestigated by fitting a linear orthogonal polynomial regression to each monkey's profile across sessionsand performing two-way ANOVAs on the resulting linear and intercept terms. Results from all treated monkeys were combined and compared to the contro l group. There were no treatment-related effects on either the fixed interval (FI) or fixed ratio (FR) co mponent for pause time or run rate. Analysis of the quarter-life revealed a significant treatment by sex eff ect as well as a main effect for sex. Post hoc t-tests revealed a significant difference in quarter-life of treated male and female monkeys and a marginal difference between treated and control males. The FI run rate of the male monkeys was significantly greater than that of the female monkeys whereas the FR run rate of the males was marginally greater. These results indicate that there may be a differential e ffect of methylmercury on male and female monkeys, which could be interpreted as an effect on temporal discrimination. The authors concluded that adult monkeys exposed to in utero methylmercury exhibited very limited sex-related effects on the FI/FR intermittent schedule of reinforcement. Typical neurotoxic signs observed in rats exposed to methylmercury include muscle spasms, gait disturbances, flailing, and hindlimb crossing (Fuyuta et al. 1978; Inouye and Murakami 1975; Magos et al. 1980, 1985). These effects have been observed after acute-duration gavage dos ing with methylmercury concentrations at doses as low as 4 mg Hg/kg/day fo r 8 days (Inouye and Murakami 1975) and may not be observed until several days after cessation of dosi ng (Inouye and Murakami 1975; Magos et al. 1985). Histopathological examination of the nervous systems of affected rats has shown degeneration of cerebellar granule cells and dorsal root ganglia (Magos et al. 1980, 1985) and degenerativ e changes in peripheral nerves (Fehling et al. 1975; Miyakawa et al. 1974, 1976). Comparison of the effects of 5 doses of8 mg Hg/kg/day as ethyl- or methylmercury showed dorsal root damage as well as flailing and hindlimbMERCURY 134 2. HEALTH EFFECTS crossing after exposure to both chemicals, but only methylmercury caused substantial cerebellar damage (Magos et al. 1985). Additional changes in rats exposed to methylmercury have also been observed. Rats exposed to a single gavage dose of 19.9 mg Hg/ kg as methylmercuric chloride were found to have statistically significant differences in open-field test s, such as decreases in standing upright, area traversed, and activity, compared to controls. However, no accompanying histopathological changes were observed (Post et al. 1973). The exposed animals were also le thargic and ataxic initially, but symptoms disappeared within 2-3 hours. Changes in the phases of sleep we re also observed in rats given 2 doses of 4 mg Hg/kg/day as methylmercuric chloride (Arito and Takahashi 1991). Paradoxical sleep was decreased and slow-wave sleep was increased. At a higher dose (12 mg Hg/kg/day for 2 days), circadian sleep patterns were also disrupted. Administration of a single dose of methylmercuric chloride (0.8 mg Hg/kg) producedblood-brain barrier dysfunction in ra ts (Chang and Hartmann 1972b) similar to that reported for inorganic mercury as discussed previously. In rabbits given 5.5 mg Hg/kg as methylmercuric acetate for 1-4 days,widespread neuronal degenerative changes (in cervical ganglion cells, cerebellum, and cerebral cortex) have been observed without accompanying behavioral changes (Jacobs et al. 1977). Longer-duration studies in animals have shown qualitativ ely similar effects, but generally at lower daily doses with increasing durations of exposure. Rats gi ven a dose of 10 mg Hg/kg as methylmercuric chloride once every 3 days for 15 days showed degeneration in the cerebellum with flailing and hind leg crossing (Leyshon and Morgan 1991). Rats given a TWA dose of 2.1 mg Hg/kg/day as methylmercury iodide or 2.4 mg Hg/kg/day as methylmercury nitrate by oral gavage for 29 days became weak and severely ataxicand developed paralysis of the hind legs (Hunter et al. 1940). Severe degene ration of peripheral nerves, posterior spinal roots, and trigeminal nerves were reported. Severe degenerative changes were also observed in the dorsal root fibers of rats given 1.6 mg Hg/kg/day as methylmercuric chloride for 8 weeks (Yip and Chang 1981). Similarly, ataxia (beginni ng the second week of exposure) and cerebellar edema and necrosis occurred in rats after 7 weeks of e xposure by gavage to 1.68 mg Hg/kg as methylmercury dicyanidiamide for 5 days a week (Magos a nd Butler 1972). When rats were administered 0.8 mg Hg/kg/day as methylmercuric chloride by ga vage for up to 11 weeks, effects similar to those reported for mercuric chloride (e.g ., root ganglia and neurotoxic clinical signs) were seen but with increased severity (Chang and Hartmann 1972a). Mice have shown comparable effects at similar doses. Mice exposed to 1.9 or 9.5 mg Hg/kg/day as methyl- mercury in the drinking water for 28 weeks exhibited degeneration of Purkinje cells and loss of granular cells in the cerebellum (MacDonald and Harbis on 1977). At the higher of these doses, hind limb MERCURY 135 2. HEALTH EFFECTS paralysis was observed as early as 8 days, whereas at 1.9 mg Hg/kg/day, decreases in motor activity and hind limb paralysis did not develop until 24 weeks of exposure. Interestingly, cerebellar lesions were observed at 1.9 mg Hg/kg/day as early as 8 days afte r the start of dosing. Neuronal degeneration and microgliosis were observed in the corpus striat um, cerebral cortex, thalamus, and hypothalamus, accompanied by hind leg weakness, in mice administered 1 or 4 mg Hg/kg/day as methylmercuric chlorideby gavage for 60 days (Berthoud et al. 1976). Simila rly, a marked neurotoxic disturbance (not further identified) was reported in mice that received 3.1 mg Hg /kg/day as methylmercuric chloride in the diet for 26 weeks (Mitsumori et al. 1981). No effects of this ty pe were observed in this study at 1.6 mg Hg/kg/day, but it is unknown whether more subtle neurological effect s may have been missed, as the intent of this study was not to identify neurotoxic effects of methylmercury. Some studies suggest that cats and monkeys are more sensitive to the neurotoxic effects of organic mercury than rodents. Cats fed tuna contaminated with me thylmercury at doses equivalent to 0.015 mg Hg/kg/day for 11 months, starting when the cats were kittens, di splayed degenerative changes in the cerebellum and the cerebral cortex (Chang et al. 1974). However, only 3 of 16 animals exhibited incoordination and weakness. Similarly, cats given gavage doses of meth ylmercuric chloride as low as 0.25 mg Hg/kg/day for 44-243 days displayed degenerative lesions in the granul e and Purkinje cells of the cerebral cortex and/or cerebellum and degenerative changes in the white matter, but no manifestations of neurotoxicity (ataxia, loss of righting reflex, visual and sensory impairme nts) were observed until 0.5 mg Hg/kg/day was given (Khera et al. 1974). Neonatal monkeys given 0.5 mg Hg/kg/day as methylmercuric chloride in infant formula for 28-29 days exhibited stumbling and falling prior to termination of exposure (Willes et al. 1978). Despite the termination of exposure, abnorma lities in the several reflexes; blindness; abnormal behavior consisting of shrieking, crying, and temper tantrums; and coma developed. Histopathological analyses showed diffuse degeneration in the cerebral co rtex (especially the calcarine, insular, monkeys exposed to methylmercuric chloride in biscuits exhibited tremors and visual field impairment (Evans et al. 1977). These effects were observed in animals that were first administered4-5 priming doses of 1 mg Hg/kg at 5-day intervals (no toxicity observed), followed by \"maintenance\"doses of 0.5-0.6 mg Hg/kg once a week for 87-256 days. Squirrel monkeys developed similar symptomsafter receiving a single priming dose of 1 or 2 mg Hg /kg as methylmercuric chloride by gavage, followed 77 days later by maintenance doses of 0.2 mg Hg/kg once a week for 90-270 days (Evans et al. 1977). The doses were adjusted to maintain steady-state bl ood mercury levels in the range of 1-4 ppm. No tremors or convulsions were observed in female monkeys ( Macaca fascicularis ) during a 150-day exposure MERCURY 136 2. HEALTH EFFECTS to methylmercury chloride at 0.04 mg Hg/kg/day (P etruccioli and Turillazzi 1991). However, beginning at 177-395 days after exposure to methylmercuric hydroxide at 0.08 mg Hg/kg/day, 6 of 7 female monkeys (Macaca fascicularis ) exhibited slight tremors and decreased sucking responses, followed by claw-like grasp, gross motor incoordination, and apparent b lindness (Burbacher et al. 1984, 1988). These effects were also observed in one animal from each of the lower-dose groups (0.04 and 0.06 mg Hg/kg/day) (Burbacher et al. 1988). Miyama et al. (1983) attempted to correlate electrophy siological changes with \"early\" neurological signs in rats during dietary exposure to methylmercuric chloride for an unspecified period of time. They observed the following sequence in the onset of electrophysiological-somatic signs: fall in compound actionpotential > decrease in sensory nerve conduction velocity > tail rotation > weight loss. However, varying doses of selenium were co-administered with the meth ylmercury, complicating the interpretation of these results. Evidence for a neurochemical component of methyl mercury-induced toxicity following intermediate- duration exposures has been reported (Concas et al. 1983; Sharma et al. 1982; Tsuzuki 1981). A depression in the synthesis of the neurotransmitter, dopamine (whole-brain levels), was observed in the absence of clinical signs of neurotoxicity in rats fed doses as low as 0.8 mg Hg/kg/day as methylmercuric chloride once every 3 days for 15 days (Sharma et al. 1982). An increased number (but not an affinity) ofbenzodiazepine receptor binding sites and a decreased content of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) were 3.92 mg Hg/kg/day as chloride in the drinking water for 20 days (Concas et al. 1983). Activities of several enzy mes associated with central neurotransmitter metabolism 3.2 mg Hg/kg/day as methylmercury by gavage for 50 days (Tsuzuki 1981). These findings suggest that an alteration in neurotransmission may be one mechanism of action fo r mercury-induced neurotoxicity. However, the observed effects on the neurotransmitters may be secondary to other effects on the nervous system. The chronic neurotoxic effects of methylmercury in animals are similar to those seen after intermediate exposure. Mice administered methylmercuric chloride in the diet for 2 years at approximately0.6 mg Hg/kg/day showed posterior paralysis and sensory neuropathy, characterized by cerebral and cerebellar necrosis, as well as degeneration of spinal dor sal nerve roots and the sciatic nerve (Hirano et al. 1986; Mitsumori et al. 1990). Cats fed contaminated fi sh or contaminated fish and methylmercury at dosesMERCURY 137 2. HEALTH EFFECTS as low as 0.046 mg Hg/kg/day for 2 years exhibited ne urobehavioral toxic signs, including mild impairment of motor activity and diminished sensitivity to pain (Charbonneau et al. 1976). These effects began after 60 weeks of exposure but did not progress during the rema inder of the 2 years of exposure. At higher doses of 0.074 and 0.18 mg Hg/kg/day, ataxia, alterations in gait, motor incoordination, muscle weakness, changes in temperament, and convulsions were also observed. Histopathological analyses showed neuronal degeneration in the motor, sensory, auditory, and occi pital cortices and cerebellar granule cell monkeys fed 0.05 mg Hg/kg/day as methylmercuric chloride from birth until the age of 3-4 yearsdisplayed impaired spatial vision at that time (Ri ce and Gilbert 1982). Continued dosing until 6.5-7 years of age resulted in clumsiness, decreased fine motor pe rformance, and insensitivity to touch when tested at 13 years of age (Rice 1989c). Impaired high-frequency hearing was also displayed by these monkeys whentested at 14 years of age (Rice and Gilbert 1992). It is noteworthy that a wide range of neurotoxicsymptoms (motor, visual, and auditory) were observe d in a species similar to humans several years after dosing had ceased. No clinical signs or histopathologi cal evidence of neurotoxicity was observed in rats that received 0.1 mg Hg/kg/day as methylmercuric chloride in the diet for 2 years (Verschuuren et al. 1976). Deficiencies in many of the studies make it difficult to fully evaluate the quality of the data reported. General problems include the following: (1) many deta ils of experimental protocols were omitted, thereby prohibiting an evaluation of the study's adequacy; (2) ve ry often, only one dose was used, so an analysis of any possible dose-response relationships was not possibl e, and the possibility that certain observed effects were not compound-related cannot be excluded; (3) c ontrol data often were not presented; and (4) the results were frequently described in subjective term s, and no attempt was made to quantitate the data. Despite these limitations, animal studies do provide irre futable evidence that the central and peripheral nervous systems are target organs for organic mercury-induced toxicity. In summary, methylmercury is neurotoxic to humans and to several species of experimental animals following acute, intermediate, and chronic oral exposure. The major effects that are seen across the studies include motor disturbances, such as ataxia and trem ors, as well as signs of sensory dysfunction, such as impaired vision. The predominant neuropathological feature is degenerative changes in the cerebellum, which is likely to be the mechanism involved in many of the motor dysfunctions. In humans, disruptions of higher functions have also been noted, as evidenced by depression and irritability. MERCURY 138 2. HEALTH EFFECTS The highest NOAEL values and all reliable LOAEL va lues for neurotoxic effects in each species and duration category are listed in Table 2-3 and plotted in Figure 2-3 for organic mercury. 2.2.2.5 Reproductive Effects Inorganic Mercury. In an attempt to terminate her pregnancy, a 31-year-old woman ingested 30 mg Hg/kg as mercuric chloride in week 10 of her pregnancy (A fonso and deAlvarez 1960). Despite gastric lavage and treatment with dicapmerol, 13 days after exposure va ginal bleeding and uterine cramps occurred, followed by spontaneous abortion of the fetus and placenta. It was inconclusive whether the abortion was directly due to the mercury exposure. Organic Mercury. No studies were located regarding reproductive effects in humans following oral exposure to organic mercury. Abortions and decreased mean litter size are the pre dominant reproductive effects in different species of animals following oral exposure to organic mercury. Groups of 30 pregnant Fi scher 344 rats were orally administered 10, 20, or 30 mg/kg as methylmercuric ch loride dissolved in saline on Gd 7. Controls were given saline only (n=30). Maternal body weight gain and deaths were monitored. On Gd 20, the dams were laparotomized under ether anesthesia, and th e fetuses were removed. Surviving fetuses were examined for gross toxic effects, sex, and weight; half were stained for skeletal examination. Mercury levels in maternal and fetal organs were measured. The LD50 of methylmercuric chloride for fetuses was calculated. Maternal body weights were decreased for 2 days in rats given 10 mg/kg, for 6 days in rats given 20 mg/kg, and were continuously decreased fo r rats given 30 mg/kg methylmercuric chloride. Survival rates of fetuses were 19.2, 41.4, and 91.1% l ess than controls for the 10, 20, and 30 mg/kg methyl- mercuric chloride groups, respectively. Implantati on sites in the 3 groups decreased by 5.9, 13.7, and 22.5%, respectively, compared with controls. Preimp lantation losses in the 3 groups were 17.2, 24.8, and 30.1%, respectively; postimplantation losses were 16.7, 34.1, and 88.9%, respectively. The reduction of litter weight was greatly enhanced with increasing meth ylmercuric chloride doses (32.3, 67.0, and 89.2%, respectively), presumably due to postimplantation loss, which already increased at high treatment levels. The LD50 of methylmercuric chloride for fetuses was dete rmined to be 16.5 mg/kg. Mercury content in maternal organs was highest in the kidneys, followed by blood, spleen, liver, and brain, while in fetal organs it was highest in the liver (Lee and Han 1995).MERCURY 139 2. HEALTH EFFECTS Pregnant hamsters that received a single oral gavage dose of mercuric acetate on Gd 8 showed an increase in the incidence of resorptions at doses as low as 22 mg Hg/kg (Gale 1974). The incidence of resorptions was 35% at 22 mg Hg/kg, and increases were observe d in a dose-related manner (53% at 32 mg Hg/kg, 68% at 47 mg Hg/kg, and 99% at 63 mg Hg/kg). In a study by Khera (1973), after 5-7 days of oral ga vage doses of 1, 2.5, or 5 mg Hg/kg/day as methyl- mercuric chloride, male rats were mated to unexposed female rats. A dose-rela ted reduction of mean litter size was attributed to preimplantation losses from inco mpatibility of sperm-to-implantation events after mercury treatment of the parent male rat. At doses of 2 mg Hg/kg/day as methylmercury by gavage during Gd 6-9, pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats showed no differences in ma ternal body weight gain before parturition or in the body weights of the offspring (Fredriksson et al. 1996). In male mice, no reduction in the incidence of fertile matings was observed after administration of 5-7 oral doses of up to 5 mg Hg/kg/day as methylmercuric chloride (Khera 1973). There was a significant dose-related decrease in the number of pups born per litter in mice receiving oral doses of 3, 5, or 10 mg Hg/kgadministered on Gd 8 as methylmercuric hydroxide (Hughes and Annau 1976). Effects were not observed at 2 mg Hg/kg/day. Similarly, female mice administered 20 mg Hg/kg/day as methylmercuric chloride bygavage on Gd 10 had increased resorptions, decreased live fetuses per litter, and decreased numbers of fetuses per litter (Fuyuta et al. 1978). After guinea pigs were exposed to 11.5 mg Hg/kg as methylmercuricchloride by gavage on Gd 21, 28, 35, 42, or 49, ha lf of the litters were aborted 4-6 days after treatment (Inouye and Kajiwara 1988). An increased rate of re productive failure due to decreased conceptions and increased early abortions and stillbirths occurred in fe male monkeys exposed to 0.06 or 0.08 mg Hg/kg/day as methylmercury for 4 months (Burbacher et al. 1988). The menstrual cycle length was not affected atthese dose levels. Reproductive effects were not obser ved in monkeys exposed to 0.04 mg/kg/day for the same duration. Testicular functions were studied in monkeys (M. fascicularis) exposed to 0.025 or 0.035 mg Hg/kg/day as methylmercury by gavage for 20 weeks (Mohamed et al. 1987). The mean percentage of motile spermatozoa and the mean sperm speed were signifi cantly decreased for both treatment groups compared to controls. Morphological examination of semen smear s indicated an increased incidence of tail defects (primarily bent and kinked tails) in both exposed groups . No histopathological effects were evident on the testes. The study was limited because there we re only three animals in each exposure group.MERCURY 140 2. HEALTH EFFECTS Testicular effects were also observed after chronic- duration exposure to methylmercuric chloride. Tubular atrophy of the testes was observed in mice ingesting 0.69 mg Hg/kg/day in their feed for up to 2 years(Mitsumori et al. 1990). Decreased spermatogenesis was observed in mice receiving 0.73 mg Hg/kg/day inthe diet (Hirano et al. 1986). No adverse effects on the testes were observed in these studies at0.14-0.15 mg Hg/kg/day. Similarly, no adverse effect s were observed in the testes, prostate, ovaries, or uterus of rats exposed through the diet to 0.1 mg Hg/kg/day as methylmercuric chloride for 2 years (Verschuuren et al. 1976). The highest NOAEL values and all reliable LOAEL va lues for reproductive effects in each species and duration category are recorded in Table 2-3 a nd plotted in Figure 2-3 for organic mercury. 2.2.2.6 Developmental Effects Inorganic Mercury. No studies were located regarding developmental effects in humans or animals following oral exposure to inorganic mercury. Organic Mercury. When grains treated with fungicides containing mercury have been accidentally consumed or when fish with high levels of methyl mercury have been eaten, epidemics of human mercury poisonings have occurred with high incidences of de velopmental toxicity. These episodes, as well as case reports from isolated incidences of maternal consum ption of organic forms of mercury during pregnancy, have provided evidence that the developing nervous sy stem of the fetus is highly sensitive to mercury toxicity. The first such incident was reported in Sweden in 1952 when flour from grain treated with an unspecified alkyl mercury compound ingested by a pregnant woman was associated with developmentaltoxicity. An apparently normal infant was born, but the infant later displayed brain damage manifested by mental retardation, incoordination, and inability to move (Engleson and Herner 1952). A 40-year-old woman, 3 months pregnant, consumed methylmercury- contaminated meat for an unspecified duration and subsequently delivered a male infant with elevated urinary mercury levels (Snyder and Seelinger 1976). At 3 months, the infant was hypotonic, irritable, and exhibited myoclonic seizures. At 6 years of age, the childdisplayed severe neurological impairment (e.g., bli ndness, myoclonic seizures, neuromuscular weakness, inability to speak) (Snyder and Seelinger 1976). In the 1955 mercury poisoning outbreak in Minamata, Japan, severe brain damage was described in 22 infants whose mothers had ingested fish contaminated with methylmercury during pregnancy (Harada 1978). The types of nervous system effects described in theMinamata outbreak included mental retardation; re tention of primitive of the cerebral and granule cell layer of the cerebellum; dysmyelinati on of the pyramidal tracts; and an abnormal neuronal cytoarchitecture. It has been suggested that th e widespread damage involved derangement of basic developmental processes, such as neuronal migrati on (Choi et al. 1978; Matsumoto et al. 1965) and neuronal cell division (Sager et al. 1983). Large-scale poisonings also occurred in Iraq in 1956 and 1960 (Bakir et al. 1973). Thirty-one pregnant women were victims of poisoning; 14 women died from ingesting wheat flour from seeds treated with ethylmercury p-toluene sulfonanilide (Bakir et al. 1973) . Infants were born with blood mercury concentrations of 250 \u00b5g/100 mL and suffered severe brain damage. Similar cases of severe brain damage resulting from prenatal exposure to methylmercury were reported in an outbreak of methylmercury poisoning in Iraq occurring in 1971-1972 (Amin-Zaki et al . 1974). Attempts to correlate symptoms with exposure levels have shown that a dose-response relationship exists between the severity of the neurological symptoms in offspring and the maternal intake of meth ylmercury (as determined using analysis of hair for mercury content) (Cox et al. 1989; Marsh et al. 1980, 1981, 1987). Delays in walking and talking were more often associated with lower peak hair levels during pregnancy than were mental retardation and seizures (Marsh et al. 1981, 1987). These studies showed that the most severely affected children had been exposed to methylmercury during the second trimester of pregnancy. Male offspring were more severely affected than female offspring. Neurological a bnormalities have also been observed among offspring of Cree Indians in Quebec, Canada, exposed to methyl mercury in fish (McKeown-Eyssen et al. 1983). A significant correlation was observed between male o ffspring with abnormal muscle tone or reflexes and maternal prenatal exposure (as determined using hair levels). An analysis of peak hair mercury levels during pregnancy in mothers exposed during th e 1971-1972 outbreak in Iraq has led to an estimated population threshold of 10 ppm (highest value during pr egnancy, for total mercury in hair) associated with delays in the onset of walking in infants (Cox et al . 1989). However, this estimated threshold for the Iraqi population depends heavily on the assumed background fre quency for abnormal onset of walking time, as well as the threshold chosen to define onset of walk ing as abnormal. Furthermore, most of the positive responses (i.e., reported delays in onset of walking or talking) were observed for maternal hair levels above about 60 ppm. Only 3 of 24 children with positive res ponses were born to mothers with hair levels below 59 ppm. The peak total mercury hair levels during pr egnancy for the mothers of those 3 children were 14, 18, and 38 ppm (WHO 1990). A maternal exposure le vel of 0.0012 mg/kg/day, corresponding to a hair MERCURY 142 2. HEALTH EFFECTS level of 14 ppm, was estimated for the Iraqi wome n using a simple, one-compartment pharmacokinetic model (see Section 2.4). Davidson et al. (1995b) studied the effects of prenatal methylmercury exposure from a diet high in fish on developmental milestones in children living in th e Republic of Seychelles (i.e., the Seychelles Child Development Study (SCDS). In this double blind study , children were evaluated with the Bayley Scales of Infant Development (BSID) at 19 months of age (n=738). The 19-month cohort represented 94% of the initially enrolled pairs. The cohort was evaluated ag ain at 29 months (n=736) with the BSID and the Bayley Infant Behavior Record. Mercury exposure was determined by cold vapor atomic absorption analysis of maternal hair segments during pregna ncy. The 29-month cohort represented approximately 50% of all live births in the year 1989. This particular study population was carefully selected based on thefollowing reasons: (1) they regularly consume a high quantity and variety of ocean fish; (2) pre-studymercury concentration in maternal hair was in the appropriate range (<5 to > 45 ppm) to study low-level exposure; (3) there is no local industry for pollution, and the Seychelles location is 1,000 miles from any continent or large population center; (4) the Seychello is population is highly litera te, cooperative, and has minimal immigration; and (5) the Seychellois constitu te a generally healthy population, with low maternal alcohol and tobacco use. The association between maternal hair mercury concentrations and neurodevelopmental outcomes at 19 and 29 months of age was examined by multiple regression analysis with adjustment for confounding variables. Testing was performed by a team of Seychellois nursesextensively trained in administration of the BSID. Maternal hair concentrations measured in hair seg ments that corresponded to pregnancy ranged from 0.5 to 26.7 ppm, with a median exposure of 5.9 ppm for the entire study group. The mean BSID Mental ScaleIndexes at both 19 and 29 months were comparable to the mean performance of U.S. children. The mean BSID Psychomotor Scale Indexes at 19 and 29 months were 2 standard deviati on units above U.S. norms, but consistent with previous findings of motoric precoc ity in children reared in African countries. No effect of mercury was detected on BSID scores at either age. On the Bayley Infant Behavior Record, activity level in boys, but not girls, decreased with increasing mercury exposure. The only subjective observationcorrelated with prenatal mercury exposure was a slight decrease in activity level in boys (but not girls) as determined by the Bayley Infant Behavior Record. The overall study cohort was broken dow n into sub-groups based upon matern al hair EFFECTS >12 ppm (n=99). No significant or remarkable effect on the activity of the respective groups of children was observed outside the highest concentration group (i .e., maternal hair concentrations >12 ppm). When boys were examined separately, there appeared to be a trend toward decreased activity with increasing mercury concentrations, most visible above the group median value of 5.9 ppm. The mercury effect was highly significant in males (p=0.0004), but it was not statistically significant (p=0.87) in females. Theactivity level scores for males decreases 1/10 point (on a 9-point scale) for every ppm of mercury inmaternal hair. While the activity score for the overa ll cohort was comparable to the mode of 5 for U.S. children, those children born to mothers with hair me rcury levels of 20 ppm, males scored >1 point below the U.S. mode value. Scores of females remained at the comparable value for U.S. children, regardless of the magnitude of maternal hair mercury level. Wh en the subjective activity scores for male and female children are evaluated collectively, no significant/remar kable decrease in activity is apparent outside the >12 ppm maternal hair concentration group. The aff ect on activity level in boys is not considered an adverse effect, and the 5.9 ppm level is categorized as a NOAEL. Since the children had been exposed in utero , they represent the most sensitive subpopulation. Myers et al. (1997) evaluated the population of the SC DS for developmental milestones similar to those determined in Iraq. As part of this ongoing study, cohort children were evaluated at 6.5, 19, 29, and 66 months of age. At 19 months care-givers were asked at what age the child walked (n=720 out of 738) and talked (n=680). Prenatal mercury exposure was de termined by atomic absorption analysis of maternal hair segments corresponding to hair growth during the pregnancy. The median mercury level in maternal hair for the cohort in this analysis was 5.8 ppm with a range of 0.5-26.7 ppm. The mean age (in months) at walking was 10.7 (SD=1.9) for females and 10.6 (SD=2.0) formales. The mean age for talking (in months) was 10.5 (SD=2.6) for females, and 11.0 (SD=2.9) for males. After adjusting for covariates and statistical outlie rs, no association was found between the age at which Seychellois children walked or talked and prenatal e xposure to mercury. The ages for achievement of the developmental milestones were normal for walking and talking in the Seychellois toddlers following prenatal exposure to methylmercury from a maternal fish diet. The 5.8 ppm NOAEL of this study is thusconsiderably below the one derived from the dose-respon se analysis of the data for the Iraqi methymercury poisonings (10 ppm). The SCDS cohort continues to be monitored and evaluated for developmental effects. In an analysis of the latest round of outcome measures for children at ag e 66 months (n=708), Davidson et al. (1998) report noMERCURY 144 2. HEALTH EFFECTS adverse developmental effects associated with prenatal and postnatal exposure to methylmercury in fish at the levels experienced in this cohort. The actual e xposure is reflected in a mean maternal hair level of 6.8 ppm for the prenatal exposure (SD=4.5, n=711, range , 0.5-26.7) and in a mean level of 6.5 ppm (SD=3.3, n=708, range, 0.9-25.8) for both the prenatal and subsequent postnatal exposure. The age-appropriate main outcome measures included: (1) the McCarthy Scales of Children's Abilities, (2) the Preschool Language Scale, (3) the Woodcock-J ohnson Tests of Achievement\u2014Letter and Word Recognition, (4) Woodcock-Johnson Tests of Achievem ent\u2014Applied Problems and, (5) the Bender Gestalt test, and (6) the Child Behavior Checklist. The test r esults were similar to what would be expected from a healthy, well-developing U.S. population. No test indi cated a deleterious effect of methylmercury from the exposure levels received in this popul ation. Four of the six measures showed better scores in the highest MeHg groups compared with lower groups for both pren atal and postnatal exposure. The authors conclude that this result is likely due to the benefits of in creased levels of fish in the diet, possibly because of increased consumption of omega-3-fatty acids. Serum from a subset of 49 of the children was sampled for polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) levels. None of the samples had detectable levels (detection limit 0.2 ng/mL) for any of the 28 congeners assayed (from congener 28 to 206), indicating that was no concurrent (i.e, potentially confounding) exposure to PCBs in this population. The median level of total mercury for each of 25 species sampled was 0.004-0.75 ppm, with most medians in the range of0.05-0.25 ppm, levels that are comparable to fish in th e U.S. market. The authors conclude, that this most recent NOAEL of 6.8 ppm for the SCDS cohort at 66 mont hs of age strongly supports the findings at earlier ages, and that the benefits of eating fish outwei gh the small risk of adverse effects from an increased exposure to methylmercury for this exposure pathway. Weihe et al. (1996) began a long-term evaluation of th e health implications for people living in the Faroe Islands who are exposed to heavy metals and polyc hlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) from the consumption of fish and pilot whales. A birth cohort of 1,000 childre n was examined at approximately 7 years of age for neurobehavioral dysfunctions associated with prenatal exposure to mercury and PCB. Preliminary analyses of the data show that several neurobehavioral test s are associated with mercury exposure parameters. With emphasis on prenatal exposures to PCB, another cohort was generated duri ng 1994-1995, and this cohort will be followed closely during the next years. In the Faroe Islands, marine food constitutes a considerable part of the diet. In addition to fish, both meat and blubber from pilot whales are included in the diet. Muscle tissue of pilot whales caught in the Faroe Islands cont ains an average mercury concentration of 3.3 \u00b5g/g (16 nmol/g), about half of which is methylmercury. In some years an evenly distributed annual catch of pilot whales would make the average dietary intake of mercury close to more than the ProvisionalMERCURY 145 2. HEALTH EFFECTS Temporary Weekly Intake of 0.3 mg recommended by WHO. In 1 of 8 consecutive births, the mercury concentration in maternal hair exceeded a limit of 10 \u00b5g/g, a level where neurobehavioral dysfunction in the child may occur. The maximum level was 39.1 \u00b5g/g. Mercury concentrations in umbilical cord blood showed a similar distribution with a maximum of 351 \u00b5g/L. The large variation in mercury exposure is associated with differences in the frequency of whal e dinners. The average PCB concentration in pilot whale blubber is very high (about 30 \u00b5g/g). With an estimated daily consumption of 7 g of blubber, the average daily PCB intake could therefore exceed 200 \u00b5g (i.e., close to the Acceptable Daily Intake). In Scandinavia, the average daily PCB intake is about 15-20 \u00b5g. In the continuation of this work, Grandjean et al. (1997b, 1998) studied a cohort of 1,022 consecutive singleton births generated during 1986-1987 in the Faro e Islands. Increased methylmercury exposure from maternal consumption of pilot whale meat was estim ated from mercury concentrations in cord blood and maternal hair. At approximately 7 years of age, 917 of the children underwen t detailed neurobehavioral examination. Neuropsychological tests included Fi nger Tapping; Hand-Eye Coordination; reaction time on a Continuous Performance Test; Wechsler Intelligence S cale for Children-Revised Digit Spans, Similarities, and Block Designs; Bender Visual Motor Gesta lt Test; Boston Naming Test; and California Verbal Learning Test (Children). Neurophysiological tests emphasized motor coordination, perceptual-motorperformance, and visual acuity; pattern reversal visu al evoked potentials (VEP) with binocular full-field stimulation, brain stem auditory evoked potentials (B AEP), postural sway, and the coefficient of variation for R-R interpeak intervals (CVRR) on the electrocar diogram were measured. Mercury in cord blood, maternal hair (at parturition), child hair at 12 months, and child hair at 7 years of age were measured. The geometric average mercury concentrations were 22.9, 4.27, 1.12, and 2.99 \u00b5g/g, respectively. Mercury concentrations in cord blood were most closely associ ated with the concentrations in maternal hair at parturition and less so with children's hair at 12 months and 7 years. Clinical examination and neurophysiological testing did not reveal any cl ear-cut mercury-related abnormalities. However, mercury-related neuropsychological dysfunctions we re most pronounced in the domains of language, attention, and memory, and to a lesser extent in vi suospatial and motor functions. The authors state that these associations remain after adjustment for covariat es and after exclusion of children with maternal hair mercury concentrations above 10 \u00b5g/g (50 nmol/g). Th ey further conclude that the effects on brain function associated with prenatal methylmercury exposure appear diverse, with early dysfunction in the Faroe Island population detectable at exposure levels currently considered to be safe.MERCURY 146 2. HEALTH EFFECTS In animals, there is evidence of developmental eff ects following oral exposure to organic mercury during gestation, lactation, and/or postweaning. Increases in several parameters indicative of developmental toxicity have been observed. Not all studies have examined neurological end points, but developmental neurotoxicity has been observed at very low exposure levels. Methylmercuric chloride administered via gavage to pregnant rats at 8 mg Hg/kg on Gd 10 resulted in increased skeletal variations (incomplete fusion of the sternebrae) (Fuyuta et al. 1979). At higher doses,decreased fetal weight and increased malformations (cleft palate) were observed. Administration of lower doses of methylmercury (4 mg Hg/kg/day) for a l onger duration of gestation (Gd 7-9 or 6-14) resulted in an increased incidence of rat fetuses with incomplete ossification or calcification (Nolen et al. 1972). The incidence of skeletal variations at 0.2 mg/kg/day was not significantly different from controls. Methyl- mercuric chloride administered to pregnant rats (n =10) via gavage at 2 mg Hg/kg/day throughout gestation (Gd 0-20) resulted in increased numbers of malfor med fetuses (Inouye and Murakami 1975). The most common malformations were generalized edema and br ain lesions. When methylmercuric chloride was administration to pregnant rats at 4 mg Hg/kg/day during Gd 7-14, there was a decreased fetal weight and an increased number of total malformations, hydrocepha lus, and wavy ribs (Fuyuta et al. 1978). At 6 mg Hg/kg/day, increased resorptions, fetal deaths, cleft palate, generalized edema, brain lesions, absence of vertebral centra, and defects of the sternum were obser ved. Skeletal variations seen at 6 mg Hg/kg/day included absence of one or more sternebrae, bipa rtite sternebrae, and bilobed vertebral centra. Administration of dose of 24 mg Hg/kg as me thylmercuric chloride to pregnant rats during Gd 6-12 resulted in decreased fetal weights and in creased malformations (Inouye and Murakami 1975). The incidence of malformations (hydrocephalus, cl eft palate, micrognathia, a nd hydronephrosis and hypoplasia of the kidneys) increased with later treatments (after Gd 7). Hydrocephalic brains had lesions in the brain mantle, corpus callosum, caudate putamen, and primordial cerebellum. Brains without hydrocephalus had lesions in similar brain areas, as well as dilation of the third ventricle and partial ablation of the ependymal lining. Groups of 30 pregnant Fischer 344 ra ts were orally administered 10, 20, or 30 mg/kg methylmercuric chloride dissolved in saline on Gd 7. Controls were given saline only (n=30). Maternal body weight gain and deaths were monitored. Maternal body weights were decreased for 2 days in rats given 10 mg/kg as methylmercuric chloride and for 6 days in rats gi ven 20 mg/kg and were continuously decreased for those given 30 mg/kg. Maternal death rates were 6.7, 16. 7, and 30% in the 10, 20, and 30 mg/kg methylmercuric chloride dose groups; no control dams died. Surviv al rates of fetuses were 19.2, 41.4, and 91.1% MERCURY 147 2. HEALTH EFFECTS less than controls for the 10, 20, and 30 mg/kg meth ylmercuric chloride groups, respectively. The LD50 of methylmercuric chloride for fetuses was determined to be 16.5 mg/kg. The backbones of fetuses were severely curved at the high-dose level; mean fetal body le ngths were reduced by 9.6, 21.7, and 48.8% in the 10, 20, and 30 mg/kg methylmercuric chloride groups, respectively, as compared to controls. Mercury content in maternal organs was highest in kidneys, follo wed by blood, spleen, liver, and brain, while in fetal organs it was highest in liver. Fetal liver and brain contained more mercury than maternal liver and brain; however, fetal kidneys retained less mercury than ma ternal kidneys. The fetal ossification center was not completely formed in sternebrae, particularly in the fifth and second bones, pelvic bones, and pectoral phalanges of fetuses in rats treated with 30 mg/kg methyl mercuric chloride. The ossified lengths of skeletal bone stained with alizarin red S were developed least in the fifth sternebrae, metacarpals in the pectoral girdle, and ischium in the pelvic girdle, and were severely retarded in development as position of the ribs goes from the sixth bone (center) to the firs t and 13th bone (each edge) (Lee and Han 1995). Four groups of 12 pregnant Sprague -Dawley rats were exposed to methylmercury or elemental mercury alone or in combination as follows: one group was administered 2 mg/kg/day methylmercury via gavage during Gd 6-9; another was exposed by inhalation to 1.8 mg/m3 metallic mercury (elemental Hg) vapor for 1.5 hours per day during Gd 14-19; a third was exposed to both methylmercury by gavage (2 mg/kg/day, Gd 6-9) Gd 14-19) (methylmercury + elemental Hg); a fourth group was given combined vehicle administration for each of the 2 treatments (control). Theinhalation regimen corresponded to an approximate dose of 0.1 mg Hg/kg/day. Maternal body weights were monitored. At postpartum day 3, each litter was reduced to 4 male offspring. Body weight, pinna unfolding, tooth eruption, and eye opening were monito red. Testing of behavioral function was performed between 4 and 5 months of age and included spontaneous motor activity, sp atial learning in a circular bath, and instrumental maze learning for food reward. Surface righting reflex and negative geotaxis were measured before weaning. There were no differences between any of the groups in maternal body weight gain or in body weight, pinna unfolding, tooth erup tion, surface righting reflex, and negative geotaxis in offspring. Offspring of dams exposed to elemental mercury showed hyperactivity in the spontaneous motor activity test chambers over all three of the following parameters: locomotion, rearing, and total activity. This effect was potentiated in the animals of the me thylmercury + elemental mercury group. In the swim maze test, the methylmercury + elemental mercury and elemental mercury groups evidenced longerlatencies to reach a submerged platform, which they had learned to mount the day before, compared to either the control or methylmercury groups. In the modified, enclosed radial-arm maze, both the methyl- mercury + elemental Hg and elemental Hg groups show ed more ambulations and rearings in the activity MERCURY 148 2. HEALTH EFFECTS test prior to the learning test. During the learning trial, the same groups (i.e., methylmercury + elemental mercury and elemental mercury) showed longer late ncies and made more errors in acquiring all eight pellets. Generally, the results indicate that co-exposur e to methylmercury, which by itself did not alter these functions at the dose given in this study, serve d to significantly enhance the effects of prenatal exposure to elemental mercury (i.e., alterations to bot h spontaneous and learned be haviors). Brain mercury concentrations in offspring were 1 ng/g w/w in the controls, 4 ng/g in the methylmercury group, 5 ng/g in the elemental mercury group, and 12 ng/g in the meth ylmercury + elemental mercury group (Fredriksson et al. 1996). Pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats were tr eated by gavage with a single oral dose of 8 mg/kg of methylmercury chloride or saline on Gd 15. Within 24 hours after birt h, litters were reduced to 6 pups per litter. Pups were weighed weekly and weaned 21 days after birth. Offspr ing of control and treated rats were killed at 14, 21, and 60 days of age. The binding characteristics of muscarinic receptors labeled in cortical membrane preparation by [3H]-L-quinuclidinyl benzilate were studied, and the mercury level in the same brain area was assessed. Total mercury content in cortical ti ssues was determined at 21 and 60 days of age. Furthermore, the performance in passive avoidan ce tasks was evaluated in 10 rats from each group at 8 weeks of age. No differences in mortality or we ight gain were observed in methylmercury-exposed pups compared to controls. At 21 days of age, the leve l of mercury in the cortex was about 30 times higher in exposed rats than in controls (190.2 ng/g w/w versus 6.4 ng/g); at 60 days, mercury levels did not differ significantly (7.4 versus 5 ng/g, respectively). Pe rinatal exposure to methylmercury significantly reduced the maximum number of muscarinic receptors (Bmax) in the brain of 14-day-old (53%) and 21-day-old (21.3%) rats, while there was no notable differen ce in 60-day-old rats. This phenomenon seems to be strictly related to the presence of mercury in the cortex since it disappeared with the normalization of mercury levels in the brain. Despite the recove ry of muscarinic receptor densities in methylmercury- exposed rats at 8 weeks of age, the avoidance latenc y was reduced in passive avoidance tests, indicating learning and memory deficits in these animals (Zanoli et al. 1994). Similar effects were observed in mice exposed to orga nic mercury. Methylmercuric chloride administered orally by gavage at resulted in 100% stillbirths or neonatal deaths and the failure of 6 of 9 dams to deliver, with no apparent maternal t oxicity (Khera and Tabacova 1973). At lower doses (2 and 4 mg Hg/kg/day) for a shorter duration during gestation (days 6-13), no increase indeaths or resorptions was observed, but increases in malformations, skeletal variations, and delays in ossification were observed (Fuyuta et al. 1978). A hi gher dose of methylmercuric chloride (16 mg Hg/kg)MERCURY 149 2. HEALTH EFFECTS administered to mice by gavage on either Gd 10 or 12 resulted in decreased fetal weight, cleft palate, and dilation of the renal pelvis (Yasuda et al. 1985). Thuvander et al. (1996) evaluated the immunomodula tion of methylmercury from perinatal exposure in mice. Offspring from Balb/c mice were exposed to meth ylmercuric chloride in the diet. Dams (16.0\u00b10.5g) were exposed to 0 (n=72), 0.5 (n=27), or 5 (n=37) mg Hg/kg for 10 weeks prior to mating, and during gestation and lactation. Pups were exposed to merc ury until day 15 of lactation; thereafter, the pups were given control milk and control diet. Samples for me rcury analysis were collected from the pups on days 22 and 50, and for immunological studies on days 10, 22, and 50. Immunological parameters included numbers of splenocytes and thymocytes, proportions of lymphocyte subpopulations within the of the B-cell mitogen LPS, NK-cell activity of splenocytes, and the primary antibody response to a viral antigen. Eight pups (n=8NS) were taken from at least three different litters for the immune function analysis. No disturbances in the behavior of dams or pups we re observed for any of the dose groups. All dams gave birth to normal sized litters (8-10 animals/litter). The high dose dams did have a small (4%) but significant increase in body weight (weeks 4, 5, 9 p<0.05, week 8 p<0.01). The exposure resulted insignificantly increased total Hg concentrations in whole blood of offspring on day 22 and 50 from the 5 mg Hg/kg group (170 and 22 ng Hg/g blood in 5 mg/kg dose group compared to 7 and 5 ng Hg/g in control,respectively), and of offspring from the 0.5 mg Hg/kg group on day 22 (24 ng Hg/g compared to 7 ng Hg/gin control). On day 50, blood mercury levels in the 0.5 mg Hg/kg group had decreased to 11 ng Hg/g compared to 5 ng Hg/g in controls. Pups showed a decreased body weight (8%) in the 5 mg/kg group at 10 days of age. Significantly increased numbers of splenocytes were found only in offspring from the 0.5 mg Hg/kg group at 10 and 22 days, and increased number of thymocytes in the 0.5 mg/kg group at22 days. Flow cytometry analysis of thymocytes re vealed increased numbers and altered proportions of lymphocyte subpopulations within the thymus in offspr ing from both of the exposed groups at 22 days. The only sign of immunosuppression was a decrease in the proportion of CD4+ thymocytes at 10 days, but thiswas seen in both mercury groups so was probably not related to a decrease in body weight. The proliferative response of splenocytes to the B-ce ll mitogen LPS was increased in offspring from dams exposed to 5 mg Hg/kg, and the primary antibody res ponse to a viral antigen was stimulated in pups from dams exposed to 0.5 mg Hg/kg. No significant differences were observed in the NK-cell activity of splenocytes except for a transient in crease in activity at 22 days in the 5 mg/kg group at one of the two effector-to-target-cell ratios tested. The present results indicate that placental and lactational transfer of MERCURY 150 2. HEALTH EFFECTS low dose mercury affects thymocyte development and stimulates certain mitogen- or antigen-induced lymphocyte activities in mice. The authors note that these results, in the context of other studies where methylmercury was observed to have suppressive eff ects, suggests that methylmercury enhances immune function within a narrow dose range. The blood levels of mercury in the present study are close to the levels found in fish-eating populations. The authors note that the clinical relevance of slight stimulation of some immune functions is unknown, but the inducti on of autoimmunity by methylmercury can not be excluded. Groups of guinea pigs exposed to a single dose of 11.5 mg Hg/kg as methylmercuric chloride at various times during gestation (66-69 days) showed differe nces in the manifestation of developmental neurotoxicity, depending on the pe riod of development when expos ure occurred (Inouye and Kajiwara 1988). Primarily developmental disturbances of the br ain (e.g., smaller brains, dilated lateral ventricles, reduced size of hippocampus and nucleus caudate-putamen ) occurred with exposures at 3, 4, or 5 weeks of pregnancy. Exposure during a later pregnancy st age (6 or 7 weeks) produced widespread focal degeneration of neurons in the neoc ortical region of fetal brains. In hamsters, methylmercuric chloride administered as a single dose of 8 mg on Gd 10 or of 1.6 mg Hg/kg/day on Gd 10-15 resulted indegeneration of cerebellar neurons (Reuhl et al. 1981a). Examination of offspring 275-300 days after birth showed simila r degeneration (Reuhl et al. 1981b) . It was not reported whether these histopathological changes correlated with behavioral changes. Functional disturbances have also been observed fo llowing exposure to methylmercuric chloride during gestation. A single dose of 16 mg Hg/kg as methylmercuric chloride administered on Gd 13, 14, 15, 16, or17 resulted in decreased spontaneous locomotor activity at 5 weeks of age, decreased righting response, abnormal tail position during walking, flexion, a nd crossing of the hindlimbs (Inouye et al. 1985). Histopathological examination of these animals show ed dilated lateral ventricles, decreased caudate putamen, and a slightly simplified cerebellar pattern. Neonates in this study were cross-fostered within 24 hours after birth to prevent intake of mercury thr ough the milk. The offspring of mice receiving 3, 5, or 10 mg Hg/kg/day as methylmercuric hydroxide on da y 8 of gestation exhibited a decreased number of avoidances, an increased number of escapes, and an increased trials to reach the criterion on a 2-way avoidance task (Hughes and Annau 1976). No eff ects were present in the 2 mg Hg/kg dose group. Offspring of rats exposed to 4 mg Hg/kg/day as methylmercuric chloride on Gd 6-9 showed impaired swimming behavior, increased passiveness, and an increased startle response (Stoltenburg-Didinger and Markwort 1990). At 0.4 mg Hg/kg/day, the offspring showed an increased startle response, but at 0.04 mg MERCURY 151 2. HEALTH EFFECTS Hg/kg/day, no effects were observed. Exposure to 6.4 mg Hg/kg as methylmercuric chloride on Gd 15 resulted in decreases in spontaneous locomotor activity , increased sensitivity to pentylenetetrazol-induced convulsions, and a transient increase in -aminobutyric acid (GABA) and benzodiazepine receptors (Guidetti et al. 1992). Using the same exposure paradi gm, shorter avoidance latency was observed in 14-, 21-, and 61-day-old rats (Cagiano et al. 1990). Glut amate receptor binding affinity and dopamine receptor number were also significantly affected in the brains of these offspring. Thus, multiple neurotransmitter systems may participate in the neurological effects observed. A sensitive test for neurological effects of gestati onal exposure to methylmerc ury is operant behavioral performance (i.e., rewarded responses to total lever pr esses). Bornhausen et al. (1980) reported a significant reduction in operant behavioral performance in 4-m onth-old rat offspring exposed to methylmercuric chloride at on Gd 6-9. A dose of 0.004 mg Hg/kg/day did not alter the behavioral performance of the offspring. No other st udies have confirmed this result to date. Pregnant hamsters received single oral gavage doses of 2.5-63 mg Hg/kg as mercuric acetate on Gd 8 (Gale 1974). Decreased crown-rump length was observed at 5 mg Hg/kg, although this effect did not increaselinearly with the dose level. The incidence of reso rptions increased at 22 mg Hg/kg and occurred in a dose- related manner. Other effects that occurred at hi gher dose levels included growth-retarded or edematous embryos. No significant developmental effects were evident at 2.5 mg Hg/kg. Developmental neurotoxicity and changes in tissues, including the liver and immune system, have been observed in studies in which exposure occurred prior to gestation and/or was continued after gestation for intermediate durations. Retarded behavioral ma turation (swimming behavior, righting reflexes) and learning disability (maze learning) were demonstrated in rat offspring receiving a diet of 0.1 mg Hg/kg/day(unspecified forms of mercury) in a contaminated fi sh diet from Gd 1 to postnatal day 42 (Olson and Boush 1975). Decreased performance in a paradigm intende d to assess tactile-kinesthetic function (use of too much force) was observed in offspring of rats expo sed to 0.08 mg Hg/kg/day as methylmercuric chloride for 2 weeks prior to mating through weaning (Elsne r 1991). No morphological changes were observed in the brains of the offspring of maternal rats give n 0.195 mg Hg/kg/day as methylmercuric chloride for 14 weeks prior to mating through postpartum day 50 (L indstrom et al. 1991). However, norepinephrine levels in the cerebellum of offspring were signifi cantly increased. Methylmercuric chloride at doses of 0.25 mg Hg/kg/day administered beginning several week s prior to gestation resulted in an increase in the incidence of unilateral or bilateral ocular lesions in the neonates, associated with histological changes in theMERCURY 152 2. HEALTH Harderian, exorbital and parotid salivar y glands (Khera and Tab acova 1973). No effects occurred at the lower dose of 0.05 mg Hg/kg/day. Fe tal liver injury at the ultrastructural level (e.g., decreased mitochondrial volume density, enzyme activity, and protein synthesis in fetal hepatocytes) was reported after chronic exposure to low doses of 0.7-1. 4 mg Hg/kg/day as methylmercury in the drinking water of rats for 1 month before mating and up to the end of pregnancy (Fow ler and Woods 1977). The developing immune system was affected in newborn Sprague-Dawley rats exposed to 0.5 mg Hg/kg/day as methylmercury through the placenta and/or milk (Ilback et al. 1991). Results showed that exposure caused increased thymus lymphocyte activity in offspring e xposed during gestation and lactation, while decreased spleen lymphocyte activities were observed in offspr ing exposed during lactation only. Cell-mediated cytotoxicity was decreased by 41% (p<0.01) in o ffspring exposed during gestation and lactation. In chronic-duration studies, impaired visual functi on has been reported. Impaired visual recognition memory was reported for 50-to-60-day-old m onkeys born to mothers that received 0.04 or 0.06 mg Hg/kg/day as methylmercury in apple juice for an average of 168 or 747 days prior to mating(Gunderson et al. 1988). In this study, neonates were sep arated from their mothers at birth to prevent intake of mercury while nursing. Impaired spatial visual function was observed in another study in which infant monkeys were exposed to 0.01, 0.025, or 0.05 mg Hg/kg/day as methylmercuric chloride throughout gestation, followed by gavage doses 5 days a week until 4-4.5 years of age (Rice and Gilbert 1990). The study was limited, however, because only 1-5 animals were tested at each dose level. Furthermore, two ofthe high-dose animals were unavailable for testing as a result of overt mercury intoxication, and thus the two most affected animals were eliminated. Slight changes in temporal discrimination were also observed in these monkeys at 2-3 years of age (Rice 1992). However, no LOAEL can be determined for this effectbecause results from monkeys at the mid- and high doses were pooled. The highest NOAEL values and all reliable LOAEL valu es for developmental effects in each species and duration category are recorded in Table 2-3 a nd plotted in Figure 2-3 for organic mercury. 2.2.2.7 Genotoxic Effects Several studies were located regarding genotoxic effects in humans after oral exposure to organic mercury. A positive correlation between blood merc ury levels and structural and numerical chromosome aberrations was found in the lymphocytes of 23 people who consumed mercury-contaminated fish (Skerfving et al. 1974). However, several factors preclude acceptance of these findings as valid. With respect to theMERCURY 153 2. HEALTH EFFECTS increased incidence of structural aberrations, smokers were not identified, it was unclear whether chromatid and chromosome gaps were excluded from the evalua tion, and significant effects were obtained only from lymphocyte cultures initiated several days after collecti on. The more reliable approach of initiating cultures on the day of collection did not yield significant results. Similarly, the evidence of aneuploidy is suspect. Considering the age of the subjects (54-89 years in the control group and 47-84 years in the exposuregroup), the average incidence of aneuploidy in the control (1.8%) and exposed (2.8%) groups was lower than would be expected, according to results indi cating that aneuploidy in humans increases with age (Cimino et al. 1986). Skerfving et al. (1970) also reported that a significant (p<0.05) correlation was foundbetween mercury concentrations and chromosome breaks in the lymphocytes of 9 subjects who had consumed fish contaminated with methylmercury. Fo r reasons similar to those listed for the evaluation of the report by Skerfving et al. (1974), there is not yet a scientific basis to support an association betweenconsumption of fish containing high methylmercury a nd clastogenesis in human lymphocytes. In addition, one of the test subjects was regularly medicated w ith isoproterenol, a known clastogen for mammalian cells. Although an increased incidence of sister chromatid exchange was reported in humans who ate mercury- contaminated seal meat (Wulf et al. 1986), data on smoking and consumption of other heavy metals (lead and cadmium) were not provided. Therefore, the po ssible relevance of the increase in sister chromatid exchanges (SCEs) cannot be determined. A sta tistical correlation between micronucleus frequency in peripheral blood lymphocytes and total mercury c oncentration in blood (p=0.00041), as well as between micronucleus frequency and age (p=0.017), was found in a population of fishers who had eaten mercury contaminated seafood (Franchi et al. 1994). A single oral gavage administration of mercuric chlo ride to male Swiss albino mice (5 per group) at doses of 2.2, 4.4, or 8.9 mg Hg/kg induced a dose-rela ted increase in the frequency of chromosome aberrations and the percentage of aberrant cells in the bone marrow (Ghosh et al. 1991). Chromatid breaks were the most common aberration. There was no clear evidence of unscheduled DNA synthesis (UDS) in lymphocytes harvested from male and female cats (3 pe r group) chronically exposed (39 months) to dietary concentrations of 0.0084, 0.020, or 0.046 mg Hg/kg/da y as methylmercury (Miller et al. 1979). In a parallel study, significant increases in nuclear abnormalities were scored in bone marrow cells collected from the three treatment groups (5-8 cats per group); the res ponse, however, was not dose-related. Signs of compound toxicity (slight neurological impairment a nd minimal central nervous system pathology) were seen in the high-dose group, but these animals yielded the lowest number of abnormal chromosome figures. Other genotoxicity studies are discussed in Section 2.5.MERCURY 154 2. HEALTH EFFECTS 2.2.2.8 Cancer Inorganic Mercury. No studies were located regarding cancer in humans after oral exposure to inorganic mercury. Results of a 2-year National Toxicology Project (NTP 1993) study indicated that mercuric chloride may induce tumors in rats. Fischer 344 rats (60 per sex per group) received 0, 1.9, or 3.7 mg Hg/kg/day as mercuric chloride by gavage for 2 years. There were increases in the incidence of forestomach squamous cell papillomas and an increase in the incidence of thyroid follicular cell carcinomas in males in the 3.7 mg/kg group (NTP 1993). In B6C3F1 mice exposed to 0, 3.7, or 7.4 mg Hg/kg/day as mercuric chloride, renal tubule tumors were evident in 3 of the 49 high-dose males (NTP 1993), but the incidence of these tumors was not significantly increased. There was no evidence of carcinogenicity in the exposed female mice. The cancer effect level (CEL) from this st udy is recorded in Table 2-2 and is plotted in Figure 2-2. Organic Mercury. No studies were located regarding cancer in humans following oral exposure to organic mercury. Significant increases in renal tumors have been obser ved in rodents exposed either to methylmercuric chloride or phenylmercuric acetate. Dietary exposure of both ICR and B6C3F1 mice for 2 years has resulted in significant increases in renal epithelial ce ll tumors (Hirano et al. 1986; Mitsumori et al. 1981, 1990). At the highest dose of 0.69 mg Hg/kg/day (dose levels 0, 0.03, 0.14, 0.69), only male B6C3F1 mice (n=60M,60F) showed significant increases in the in cidence of renal epithelial cell adenomas and carcinomas (Mitsumori et al. 1990). No tumors were observed in the females B6C3F1 mice exposed to up to 0.6 mg Hg/kg/day. The high dose in males and females also resulted in chronic nephropathy andregeneration of the proximal tubules (more severe in males). At 0.73 mg Hg/kg/day, male ICR miceshowed significant increases in the incidence of ep ithelial cell adenocarcinomas (Hirano et al. 1986). Similar effects were observed in the ICR male mice at the highest dose of 1.6 mg Hg/kg/day (Mitsumori etal. 1981). No increase in tumor incidence was observed in rats exposed via the diet for 2 years to methyl- mercuric chloride at doses as high as 0.1 mg Hg/kg/day (Verschuuren et al. 1976). Exposure of male Wistar rats to phenylmercuric acetate in the drinking water at 4.2 mg Hg/kg/day for 2 years resulted in a significant increase in renal cell adenomas (Solecki et al. 1991). However, this reportMERCURY 155 2. HEALTH EFFECTS is limited because the assay was not intended as a carcinogenicity assay, and too few animals were used (20 per dose) to adequately assess the carcinogenicity of the phenylmercuric acetate. No tumors or precancerous lesions were reported in rats administered 0.04-66.0 mg Hg/kg/day as phenyl- mercuric acetate in the diet for 2 years (Fitzhugh et al. 1950). As discussed above for mercuric acetate, noconclusions can be drawn from this study because of its limitations. In a 2-year oral chronic-duration feeding study, no tumors or precancerous lesions were noted in rats administered mercuric acetate in the diet at doses of 0.2-66 mg Hg/kg/day (Fitzhugh et al. 1950); noconclusions could be derived on the carcinogenicity of mercuric acetate. The study was limited because the group sizes were small (10-12 rats per group); survival data were not reported; a considerable but unspecified number of rats reportedly died from pneum onia, which reduced the sensitivity of the study to detect a carcinogenic response; and only limited histopathological analyses were performed. The CELs from these studies are recorded in Table 2-3 and plotted in Figure 2-3. 2.2.3 Dermal Exposure Occupational exposure to both inor ganic and organic mercury compounds may result in dermal as well as inhalation exposure to these chemicals. The results reported in Section 2.2.1 regarding the effects associated with occupational exposure to mercury-cont aining chemicals will not be repeated here. The studies discussed below concern reports in which dermal exposure was expected to be the primary route of exposure. 2.2.3.1 Death Inorganic Mercury. A case study reported that a 27-year-old woman died 4 days after inserting an 8.75-g tablet of mercuric chloride (93 mg Hg/kg assuming 70-kg weight) into her vagina (Millar 1916). Another case study described the death of a man who had been receiving treatment for a wound with dailyapplications for approximately 2 months of a Chin ese medicine containing mercurous chloride (Kang-Yum and Oransky 1992). The patient was repor ted to have died from renal failure.MERCURY 156 2. HEALTH EFFECTS An early study conducted by Schamberg et al. (1918) re ported death in rabbits after an ointment containing 50% mercury was \"rubbed\" into the skin for 5 mi nutes; however, inadequate experimental methodology and an absence of study details prevent a determ ination of the amount of mercury involved. Organic Mercury. No studies were located regarding death in humans or animals after dermal exposure to organic mercury. 2.2.3.2 Systemic Effects No studies were located regarding respiratory, hemato logical, musculoskeletal, or hepatic effects in humans or animals after dermal exposure to inorganic or organic mercury. Cardiovascular Effects Inorganic Mercury. A number of children who were treated with an ammoniated mercury ointment or whose diapers had been rinsed in a mercuric chlori de solution experienced tachycardia and elevated blood pressure (Warkany and Hubbard 1953). No studies were located regarding cardiovascular effect s in animals after dermal exposure to inorganic mercury. Organic Mercury. No studies were located regarding cardiov ascular effects in humans or animals after dermal exposure to organic mercury. Gastrointestinal Effects Inorganic Mercury. Patients who were hypersensitive to mercury (indicated by positive patch tests) developed stomatitis at the sites of contact with amalgam fillings (Veien 1990). The contact stomatitis faded when amalgam fillings were re moved but persisted in a patient who chose to leave them in place. Abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and black stools were seen in a man who had been receiving treatmentfor a wound with daily applications for about 2 months of a Chinese medicine containing mercurous chloride (Kang-Yum and Oransky 1992). Anorexia was reported in a child who had been treated with an ammoniated mercury-containing ointment (Warkany a nd Hubbard 1953). Extensive necrosis, swelling, andMERCURY 157 2. HEALTH EFFECTS ulceration in the intestinal mucosa, vomiting, and diarrhea occurred in a woman who inserted a mercuric chloride tablet into her vagina (Millar 1916). No studies were located regarding gastrointestinal effects in animals following dermal exposure to inorganic mercury. Organic Mercury. No studies were located regarding gastroin testinal effects in humans or animals after dermal exposure to organic mercury. Renal Effects Inorganic Mercury. Congested medulla; pale and swollen co rtex; and extensive necrosis, degeneration, and calcification of tubular epithelium were reported in the kidneys of a 27-year-old woman after inserting an 8.75-g tablet of mercuric chloride (93 mg Hg /kg assuming 70-kg weight) into her vagina (Millar 1916). Decreased renal output and renal failu re were reported in a man who ha d been receiving daily applications for 2 months of a Chinese medicine containing me rcurous chloride (Kang-Yum and Oransky 1992). A woman who used a depigmenting cream containing mercuric ammonium chloride for approximately 18 years developed an impaired renal function (Dyall- Smith and Scurry 1990). Similarly, a man who used an ointment containing ammoniated mercury for psor iasis for more than 10 years developed a nephrotic syndrome with severe edema (Williams and Bridge 1958). A study of young African women who used skinlightening creams containing ammoniated mercuric ch loride for 1-36 months (a verage, 13 months) showed a nephrotic syndrome among a large portion of the women (Barr et al. 1972). The syndrome wascharacterized by elevated urinary protein, edem a, decreased serum albumin, beta- globulin, and gamma globulin and increased alpha-2-gl obulin. Remission was observed in 77% of those who discontinued use of the creams. No studies were located regarding renal effects in animals after dermal exposure to inorganic mercury. Organic Mercury. No studies were located regarding renal effects in humans or animals after dermal exposure to organic mercury.MERCURY 158 2. HEALTH EFFECTS Endocrine Effects No studies were located regarding endocrine effect s in humans or animals after dermal exposure to inorganic or organic mercury. Organic Mercury. No studies were located regarding endocrine effects in humans or animals after dermal exposure to organic mercury. Dermal Effects Inorganic Mercury. Contact dermatitis caused by acute, longe r-term, or occupational inorganic mercury exposure has been described in a number of case reports (Bagley et n 1990). Patch tests conducted in many of the cases show some cross-reactivity between various inor ganic and organic forms of and 1989; Veien 1990). In these studies, dermal exposure occurred as a result of the breakage of mercury-containing thermometers orsphygmomanometers, dental amalgams containing elem or sulfide in ta ttoos. One contact dermatitis caused by a mercuric sulfide-containing tattoo suggested that the reaction was not to mercuric sulfide itself but to a mercury derivative that was formed in the skin (Biro and Klein 1967). Excluding reports of contact dermatitis, limited inform ation was obtained regarding the dermal effects of inorganic mercury. Application of an ammoniated me rcury ointment to the skin of children or exposure to diapers that had been rinsed in a mercuric chlo ride-containing solution resulted in itching, flushing, swelling, and/or desquamation of the palms of the hands and soles of the feet (Warkany and Hubbard 1953). In addition, rashes, conjunctivitis, and/or excessive perspiration were observed. These dermal reactions were not attributed to allergic-type reac tions to the mercury. A 23-month-old boy who was exposed to an unspecified form of mercury also deve loped a \"diffuse, pinpoint, erythematous, papular rash\" and bright finger tips \"with large sheets of peeling skin\" (Tunnessen et al. 1987). Application of a 1% solution of ammoniated mercuric chloride to the skin resulted in only minor irritation in 2 of 11 exposed subjects (Kawahara et al. 1993). After 18 years of using a mercury-containing cream, aMERCURY 159 2. HEALTH EFFECTS patient exhibited blue-black pigmentation in a perifo llicular distribution on the chin and glabella (Dyall- Smith and Scurry 1990). A skin biopsy revealed black nonrefractile granules in the cytoplasm ofmacrophages in the papillary dermis and around the uppe r part of hair follicles. A boy who broke a thermometer in his mouth developed a mass consisting of hyperplasia of the epidermis, necrosis, and ulceration (Sau et al. 1991). This effect may have resulted from a combined effect of the physical injury and the mercury metal. No studies were located regarding dermal effects in animals after dermal exposure to inorganic mercury. Organic Mercury. Case report studies suggest that dermal exposure to methylmercury or phenylmercury in humans can cause rashes and blisters on the skin (H unter et al. 1940; Morris 1960). A 33-year-old male worker exposed to methylmercury nitrate dust for 2 years developed burns and blisters on his forearm (Hunter et al. 1940). These effects healed within 9 da ys. Sensitivity to phenylmercuric salts is shown by individuals who developed itchy, pruritic, papular eruptions or rashes on their skin following acute dermal exposure (Morris 1960). A 54-year-old woman with a family history of atopy was found to displayerythema (at 30 minutes postexposure) and urticaria (a t 60 minutes) when treated topically with a 0.01% solution of phenylmercuric acetate (Torresani et al . 1993). This positive reaction was associated with aggravation of facial edema and an attack of bronc hospasm. The woman, who was a farmer, was believed to have been previously exposed to phenylmercuri c acetate during contact with pesticides and herbicides used on farm crops. No studies were located regarding dermal effects in animals following dermal exposure to organic mercury. Ocular Effects. No studies were located regarding ocular effects in humans or animals after dermal exposure to inorganic or organic mercury. Body Weight Effects. No studies were located regarding body weight effects in humans or animals after dermal exposure to inorganic or organic mercury. 2.2.3.3 Immunological and Lymphoreticular Effects Inorganic Mercury. As indicated above, contact dermatitis may develop as a result of acute or occupational exposure to inorganic mercury (Anneroth et al. 1992; Bagley et al. 1987; Biro and Klein MERCURY 1990). Patch tests conducted in many of the cases show some cross- reactivity between various inorganic and organic form s and Freitas 1992; Pambor and Timmel 1989; Veien 1990). In these studies, dermal exposure occurred as a result of the breakage ofmercury-containing thermometers or sphygmomanometer s, dental amalgams containing elemental mercury, or mercuric sulfide in tattoos. One report of cont act dermatitis caused by mercuric sulfide in a tattoo suggested that the reaction was not to mercuric sulfid e itself but to a mercury derivative that was formed in the skin (Biro and Klein 1967). No studies were located regarding immunological or lymphoreticular effects in animals following dermal exposure to inorganic mercury. Organic Mercury. No studies were located regarding immunological or lymphoreticular effects in humans or animals after dermal exposure to organic mercury. 2.2.3.4 Neurological Effects Inorganic Mercury. DeBont et al. (1986) described a 4-month-old boy who had signs of acrodynia accompanied by coma, paralysis of one side of the body, generalized muscle stiffness, and muscular tremors 12 days after he was treated with yellow mercuric oxide ointment for eczema. Topical application of adepigmenting cream containing 17.5% mercuric ammonium chloride for 18 years resulted in mild tremors, anxiety, depression, and paranoid delusions in a 42-year-old woman (Dyall-Smith and Scurry 1990). Children who were treated with an ointment cont aining ammoniated mercury or who were exposed to diapers that had been rinsed in a mercuric chlori de-containing solution experienced irritability, fretfulness, and sleeplessness (Warkany and Hubbard 1953). No studies were located regarding neurological effect s in animals after dermal exposure to inorganic mercury. Organic Mercury. No studies were located regarding neurological effects in humans or animals after dermal exposure to organic mercury.MERCURY 161 2. HEALTH EFFECTS No studies were located regarding the following eff ects in humans or animals after dermal exposure to inorganic or organic mercury: 2.2.3.5 Reproductive Effects 2.2.3.6 Developmental Effects2.2.3.7 Genotoxic Effects Genotoxicity studies are discussed in Section 2.5. 2.2.3.8 Cancer No studies were located regarding cancer in humans or animals after dermal exposure to inorganic or organic mercury. 2.3 TOXICOKINETICS Absorption is high (approximately 70-80%) for inhaled metallic mercury vapor, and negligible for oral exposure to liquid metallic mercury. Absorption of inorganic mercuric salts may range from 2 to 38% depending upon the form and test conditions. Oral abso rption of organic mercury is nearly complete, but respiratory absorption data are lacking, particularly for the alkyl mercurials. The distribution data for metallic, inorganic, and orga nic mercury are consistent in identifying the kidney as the organ with the highest mercury bioaccumulation. Because of its high lipophilicity, metallic mercury can also be transferred readily through the placenta and blood-brain barrier. The oxidation of metallic mercury to inorganic divalent cation in the brain can result in retention in the brain. Inorganic mercury compounds can reach most organs; however, their low lipophilicity reduces their ability to penetrate barriers to and accumulate in the brain and fetus. The distribution of methylmercury is similar to that of metallic mercury; a relatively large amount of mercury can accumulate in the brain and fetus (compared to inorganic mercury) because of its ability to penetrate the blood-brain and placental barriers and its conversion in the brain and fetus to the inorganic divalent cation. Metallic mercury can be oxidized to inorganic di valent mercury by the hydrogen peroxidase-catalase pathway, which is present in most tissues. The inor ganic divalent cation can, in turn, be reduced to MERCURY 162 2. HEALTH EFFECTS metallic mercury. The mercurous ion is unstable in the presence of sulfhydryl groups, and undergoes disproportionation into one atom of metallic mercury a nd one ion of mercuric mercury. As with metallic mercury, organic mercury can also be converted to inorganic divalent mercury; however, the extent of conversion is less than with metallic mercury. Following exposure to metallic mercury, the eliminati on of mercury can occur via the urine, feces, and expired air. Following exposure to inorganic mercury (mercuric), mercury is eliminated in the urine and feces. Organic mercury compounds are excreted pre dominantly via the feces in humans. In animals, methylmercury is excreted in the feces, and phenylm ercury compounds are initially excreted in the feces and then in the urine. Organic mercury compounds are excreted predominantly in the inorganic form. Both inorganic mercury and methylmercury are excreted in breast milk. Absorption of metallic mercury vapor is believed to occur by rapid diffusion through the lungs. Oral absorption of inorganic mercuric mercury compounds may also involve rapid diffusion through the gastro- intestinal tract. The mechanism fo r oral absorption of mercurous mercury compounds is not known. Oral absorption of organic mercury is be lieved to depend on the ability of the organic mercury molecule to bind to molecules such as cysteine. The mechanism of action of inorganic and organic mercury compounds mayinvolve the affinity of these chemicals for sulfhydryl or thiol groups of proteins and other biologicalcompounds. 2.3.1 Absorption Absorption following inhalation of metallic mercury va pors is relatively high. Absorption following acute oral exposure to metallic mercury is negligible in both humans and animals. Methyl- and phenylmercury compounds are absorbed much more readily than inorganic mercury. Animal studies suggest oral absorption of both organic and inorganic mercury may be influenced by age and diet. Limited information was located regarding dermal absorption of inorgani c or organic mercury compounds in humans or animals.MERCURY 163 2. HEALTH EFFECTS 2.3.1.1 Inhalation Exposure Metallic and Inorganic Mercury. There are limited quantitative data on the absorption of metallic mercury vapor by humans after inhalation e xposure, although it is the most common route of inorganic mercury uptake. Metallic mercury is highly lipophilic, and ab sorption of the inhaled vapor, followed by rapid diffusion across the alveolar membranes of the lungs in to the blood, has been reported to be substantial. Exposure to 0.1-0.2 mg/m3 elemental mercury vapor resulted in approximately 74-80% of inhaled elemental mercury vapor being retained in human tissues (Hursh et al. 1976; Teisinger and Fiserova- Bergerova 1965). Indirect evidence of rapid absorpti on was provided by elevated mercury levels found in red blood cells, plasma, and excreta of 5 volunteers who inhaled radiolabeled mercury for 14-24 minutes (Cherian et al. 1978). Elevated blood levels of me rcury were also observed in humans following a brief occupational exposure (3 days) to less than 0.1 mg/m3 metallic mercury vapor (Barregard et al. 1992). Recently, Sandborgh-Englund et al. (1998) evaluated the ab sorption, blood levels, and excretion of mercury in humans after a single dose of mercury vapor. Nine healthy volunteers (2M, 7F) were exposed to 400 \u00b5gHg/m 3 mercury vapor in air (median 399 \u00b5g Hg/m3; range, 365-430 \u00b5g Hg/m3) for 15 minutes. This dose corresponded to 5.5 nmol Hg/kg body weight. Samples of exhaled air, blood, and urine were collected for 30 days after exposure. The median retention of elem ental Hg was 69% of the inhaled dose. During the first 3 days after exposure 7.5-12% of the absorbed dose was lost by exhalation, with the median half-time of Hg in expired breath being 2 days. In blood and plasma, a rapid absorption phase of Hg was seen,followed by a biexponential decline of the curves in bot h media. A substantial in terindividual variation was observed in the area under the concentration-time curves of Hg in blood and plasma. In plasma, the median half-time of the second phase was 10 days. About 1.0% of the absorbed Hg was excreted via the urine during the first 3 days after exposure whereas the es timated amount excreted during the 30 days ranged from 8 to 40%. In order to evaluate the chronic e xposure to mercury from dental amalgam in the general population, the daily Hg dose from the fillings was es timated based on the plasma Hg levels of subjects with amalgam fillings and the plasma clearance obtained in this study. The daily dose was estimated to be from 5 to 9 \u00b5g/day in subjects with an average number of amalgam fillings. There are few reports regarding the respiratory ab sorption of elemental and inorganic mercury compounds in animals. Elevated levels of mercury were det ected in blood and tissues of pregnant or nursing guinea pigs after short-term exposure (2-2.5 hour s) to metallic mercury vapors (6-10 mg/m 3) (Yoshida et al. MERCURY 164 2. HEALTH EFFECTS 1990, 1992). Following repeated exposure (5 w eeks) of rats to mercury vapor (1 mg/m3), high levels were detected in the blood and brain (Warfvinge et al. 1992) . The absorption of inorganic divalent mercury has not been measured, but it is estimated to be approximately 40% in dogs (Morrow et al. 1964). Organic Mercury. No studies were located regarding absorp tion in humans or animals after inhalation exposure to compounds of phenyl- or methylmercury. However, indirect evidence indicates organic mercury can be absorbed readily through the lungs. Following inhalation of 203Hg-labeled dimethyl- mercury, radioactivity was excreted within 6 hours, followed by a slower excretion phase (Ostlund 1969). 2.3.1.2 Oral Exposure Metallic and Inorganic Mercury. Few studies in humans were located regarding absorption of ingested metallic or inorganic mercury. For metallic mercur y, ingesting small amounts such as contained in a standard thermometer (about 0.1 mL or about 1 g) does not produce symptoms of intoxication (Wright et al.1980). Reports of ingestion of substantial amounts of elemental mercury indicate that absorption is negligible (Sue 1994; Wright et al. 1980). Two case hist ories were identified on acute effects of relatively large ingestions of metallic mercury. The first case hi story was described an ingestion of 15 mL (204 g) of metallic mercury by a 17-year-old male storekeeper who swallowed mercury from the pendulum of a clock (apparently out of curiosity rather than as a suicid e attempt). On admission, and 24 hours later, he was symptom free, and physical examination was normal. The patient had no gastrointestinal symptoms, and was treated with a mild laxative and bed rest. The results of serial daily urine mercury estimates werenormal (all less than 15 \u00b5g), and did not suggest signi ficant absorption. The radiological investigation illustrated a characteristic pattern of finely divided gl obules of mercury in the gastrointestinal tract (Wright et al. 1980). A second and massive incidence of ingestion involved a 42-year-old man who had spent much of his life (since the age of 13) repairing instruments that contai ned mercury. He intentionally ingested an estimated 220 mL (about 3,000 g) of mercury (Lin and Lim 1993). Upon admission, the patient presented with significantly elevated mercury blood levels (103 \u00b5g/L, normal <10 \u00b5g/L) and urine levels (73 \u00b5g/L, normal <20 \u00b5g/L). It is not known how much the occupati onal exposure had contributed to these levels. The patient was treated with immediate gastric lavage and cathartics. He also received D-penicillamine 1 g/day orally for 7 days. Blood and urine mercury levels obt ained 3 days after chelation therapy were 116.9 and 22.9 \u00b5g/L, respectively. By 2 weeks postexposure, most of the mercury had been excreted in the feces andMERCURY 165 2. HEALTH EFFECTS was measured at a total volume of 220 mL (this number was used to estimate the amount initially ingested). The patient was lost to follow-up for 6 months, but at 10 months following the incident, blood mercury had decreased to 1 \u00b5g/L and urine mercury to \u00b5g/L. Approximately 15% of a trace dose of mercuric nitrate in an aqueous solution or bound to calf liver protein was absorbed by the gastrointestinal tract of human s (Rahola et al. 1973). The mercurous ion demonstrated limited absorption. No information was located regardi ng the percentage of absorption of mercuric chloride by the gastrointestinal tract of humans. However, an extremely high serum inorganic mercuryconcentration (116.5 nmol/mL) was found in a woman who ingested a potentially lethal dose of powdered mercuric chloride (13.8 mg Hg/kg) (Suzuki et al. 1992). Similarly, no information was located regarding the percentage of absorption of mercuric sulfide by th e gastrointestinal tract in humans. However, elevated mercury was detected in the urine of two subjects who ingested an unspecified amount of mercuric sulfide (Yeoh et al. 1989). A number of animal studies indicate absorption of inorganic mercury in the 10-30% range. In earlier studies, absorption rate was reported as low. Only 1-2% of an orally administered dose of mercuricchloride was absorbed in mice (Clarkson 1971). In rats, using whole-body retention data, estimated mercuric chloride absorptions of 3-4, 8.5, a nd 6.5% were calculated for single oral doses of 0.2-12.5, 17.5, and 20 mg/kg, respectively (Piotrowsk i et al. 1992). More recent studies using whole-body retention data, however, indicate absorption of 20-25% calculated from single oral doses of0.2-20 mg Hg/kg as mercuric chloride in mice. Comp arison was made of retention data after oral and intraperitoneal dosing, taking excretion and intestin al reabsorption into account (Nielsen and Andersen 1990). In a subsequent study, the whole-body retention of mercury after mercuric chloride administration was observed to initially decline rapidly, indicating in complete intestinal absorption (Nielsen and Andersen 1992). Mercury was rapidly cleared from the gastroin testinal tract (to <30% of the initial dose within 2 days), and relative carcass retention increased throughout the experimental period, reaching levels around 40% of initial whole-body retention. Blood levels of mercury were closely correlated to whole-body retention of mercury during the first 3 days after admini stration of mercuric chloride (1 mg Hg/kg). After the initial 3 days, the amount of mercury in the blood declined more rapidly than the whole-body burden. Morcillo and Santamaria (1995) report absorption of 30-40% for radiolabeled mercuric chloride when administered in drinking water at 5, 50, and 500 \u00b5M Hg for 8 weeks to male rats. The percentage of totalMERCURY 166 2. HEALTH EFFECTS mercury excreted by the fecal route was significantly lower in the 500 compared to the 5 and 50 \u00b5M Hg group. The rate of oral absorption of mercuric mercury co mpounds in rats is dependent on several factors (e.g., intestinal pH, compound dissociation) (Endo et al. 1990). Age and diet also can influence the extent ofabsorption in mice (Kostial et al. 1978). One-week -old suckling mice absorbed 38% of the orally administered mercuric chloride, whereas adult mice abso rbed only 1% of the dose in standard diets. When the adult mice received a milk diet instead of the standard diet, absorption increased to 7% of the administered dose (Kostial et al. 1978). Several studies suggest that the bioavailability of mercur ic sulfide in animals is less than that of mercuric chloride (Sin et al. 1983, 1990; Yeoh et al. 1986, 1989). For example, Sin et al. (1983) found an increase intissue levels of mercury in mice orally exposed to lo w doses of mercuric chloride, but elevated levels of mercury were not found in the tissues of mice fed an e quivalent weight of mercury as mercuric sulfide. This finding indicates a difference in bioavailability between HgCl 2 and HgS in mice. However, a quantitative determination of the relative bioavailabilities of mercuric sulfide versus mercuric chloride has not been derived in the available studies. Furthermor e, the relative bioavailability of mercuric sulfide in humans has not been examined. Organic Mercury. Organic mercury compounds are more readily absorbed by the oral route than inorganic mercury compounds. Based on retention and excretion studies in humans, approximately 95% of an oral tracer dose of aqueous methylmercuric nitrate was ab sorbed (Aberg et al. 1969). Absorption of mercury was also reported in studies in which volunteers received doses of methylmercury bound to protein(Miettinen 1973) or ate bread contaminated with a fungi cide that contained methylmercury (Al-Shahristani et al. 1976); however, no quantitative data regarding the percentage of absorption were available. In vitro evidence suggests that organic mercury is also read ily absorbed in the gastro intestinal tract and that methylmercuric chloride is absorbed to a greater extent than phenylmercuric chloride (Endo et al. 1989). Complexing of methylmercury with nonprotein sulfhydryls also may play a role in intestinal absorption and reabsorption (Urano et al. 1990). Phenylmercuric sa lt in the diet was completely absorbed in mice (Clarkson 1972a) and readily absorbed in rats follo wing long-term oral administration (Fitzhugh et al. 1950). Absorption was nearly complete within 6 hours after female cynomolgus monkeys were given 0.5 mg Hg/kg as methylmercuric chloride by ga vage (Rice 1989b). Following a single oral exposureMERCURY 167 2. HEALTH EFFECTS (1 mg/kg) of methylmercuric chloride, the level of mercury in the blood of mice declined slowly. At day 14 post-dosing, the blood level was s till around 25% of the value at day 1 (Nielsen 1992). Blood levels of mercury were closely correlated to whole-body rete ntion of mercury during the first 3 days after administration of methylmercuric chloride (1 mg Hg/ kg) (Nielsen and Andersen 1992). However, at later times after administration, the amount of mercury in the blood declined more rapidly than the whole-bodyburden. The gastrointestinal retention of mercury slowly decreased in mice given organic mercury. This phenomenon is probably the result of biliary excretion and reabsorption of mercury (Nielsen and Andersen 1992). Bioavailability of methylmercury in food . Measurements of absorption and toxicity have generally been made using aqueous solutions of methylmercury. The absorption and bioavailability of methylmercury in food, specifically fish and bread, may be affected by dietary components. Potential confounders that may affect bioavailability of methylmercury are dietary phytate and other dietary fibrous materials found in bread and the complexation of methylmercury with selenium in fish. Dietary fiber and phytate . Dietary fiber and phytate are known as potential inhibitors of the absorption of divalent cations; however, the litera ture regarding the effect of dietary fiber and phytate on the bioavailability of minerals is contra dictory. Data by Yannai and Sachs (1993) indicate that phytate does not affect methylmercury absorption. Yannai and Sachs (1993) compared the absorption by rats of mercury found intrinsically in experimental fish meal w ith and without added phyta te and found no significant differences in the absorption of Hg (93\u00b15%) between 2 experimental fish meal diets (containing 1.4 \u00b5mol Hg/kg diet), with or without added sodium phyta te. The authors speculated that phytate might be preferentially bound to zinc, iron, and copper, which were present at much higher concentrations in the diet. In another experiment by Yannai and Sachs (1993), th e absorption of mercury was reduced when rats were fed a mercury-contaminated corn diet and corn silage meal. Mercury was incorporated intrinsically into the corn diet using radioactive isotopes (203Hg) infused by capillary action into the stalks of developing corn plants, which then incorporated trace amounts of isotop es into developing kernels. The corn silage meal was from a crop grown in the vicinity of an industria l zone and contained elevated amounts of mercury. Reduced absorptions of 48 and 51% were found for the corn silage and corn diet experiments, respectively. MERCURY 168 2. HEALTH EFFECTS The reduced bioavailability of the plant food diet comp ared with the animal-based diet (fish meal) may be due to the presence of indigestible fibrous materials present in plants. Another factor that might affectabsorption is the form of mercury ( 203Hg and methylmercury in the corn and fish meal diets, respectively). The experiments by Yannai and Sachs (1993) are di fferent from other absorption experiments because mercury was intrinsic to the fish, grain, or silage, wh ile in other studies mercury is simply mixed with the experimental diet, usually as mercury salts. In the Iraqi epidemic, methylmercury fungicide was applied extrinsically to wheat that was made into bread. However, no studies were located that measured the absorption of methylmercury when mixed with grain. It is also not known whether the putativecomponent(s) of grain affecting bioavailability are the same in corn and wheat. Interaction with selenium in diet . The co-administration of methylmercury and selenium is known (Cuvin-Aral ar and Furness 1991; Imura and Naganuma 1991). Furthermore, the level of selenium in human hair h as been found to negatively correlate with the level of mercury in brain tissue (Suzuki et al. 1993). Methylmercury forms a bismethylmercury selenide complex. Selenium in foods (especially fish) may also comple x with methylmercury and, therefore, may potentially reduce the bioavailability of methylmercury. The ava ilable data indicate that neither methylmercury uptake nor bioavailability is affected by its presence in fish. Experimental studies on the metabolism of methyl-mercury in humans following oral ingestion using me thylmercury bound to fish muscle protein have shown that absorption is almost complete (95% absorb ed) (Miettinen 1973). Animal studies also support this absorption value. Data on cats given fish homogenates indicate absorptions of $90% of methylmercury added to the of meth ylmercury in vivo , or from methylmercury proteinate (Berglund et al. 1971). Using blood and tissue levels as evidence of absorption, Charbonneau et al. (1976)concluded that there was no difference in the biological availability of methylmercury administered to adult cats (0.003, 0.0084, 0.020, 0.046, 0.074, or 0.176 mg Hg/kg/day 7 a week for 2 years) either as puremethylmercuric chloride in corn oil added to a di et containing uncontaminated fish or as methylmercury- contaminated fish. In the 2 highest dose groups (0.074 and 0.176 mg Hg), at 100 weeks of exposure nosignificant differences were seen in total mercury c oncentrations in blood between groups receiving the dose as methylmercuric chloride or as contaminated fish at the same dose level. In addition, monthly blood levels were comparable for all dose groups. No si gnificant differences were seen at 100 weeks in total mercury concentrations in the nervous system tissu e or other tissues (renal cortex, renal medulla, liver, spleen, adrenal, bladder, atria, ventricle, ovari es, testes, muscle) between the 2 highest dose groups receiving the dose as methylmercuric chloride or as contaminated fish at the same dose level. MERCURY 169 2. HEALTH EFFECTS 2.3.1.3 Dermal Exposure Metallic and Inorganic Mercury. Hursh et al. (1989) conclude that dermal absorption of mercury vapor poses a very minor occupational hazard compared to i nhalation exposure. They measured dermal absorption of radiolabeled metallic mercury vapor in five hum an volunteers, using arm skin as representing the whole body skin. About half of the mercury taken up was shed by desquamation of epidermal cells during the following several weeks. The remainder was slowly and diffusely released into the general circulation in contrast to the rapid release and more focal release fro m the lungs. When absorption for the total skin area (as represented by the forearm skin) was compared with the inhalation route for the same ambient concentration, the dermal route absorbed was estimat ed at 2.6% of the amount absorbed by the lung. There was no information found on the dermal absorption of liquid metallic mercury, but unless the skin surface was damaged or the contaminated surface was occl uded, it would not be expected to be high (i.e., in light of the very low absorption rate from the gastroin testinal tract). On the other hand, sloughing from the gastrointestinal tract may account for the low rate of absorption. Indirect evidence of dermal absorption is provided by clinical case studies in which mercury intoxication was reported in individuals following dermal applica tion of ointments that contained inorganic mercury salts (Bourgeois et al. 1986; DeBont et al. 1986). Absorption of mercurous salts in animals can occur through the skin (Schamberg et al. 1918); however, no quantitative data are available. The rate of absorption for mercuric chloride was not evaluated in any study. However, skin biopsies taken from 2 to 96 hours after a pplication of a 0.1% solution of mercuric chloride showed electron-dense deposits, tentatively identified as mercury, in the cells in the dermis, indicating that mercuric chloride could penetrate the outer layer of the skin (Silberberg et al. 1969). Organic Mercury. No information was identified for absorpti on of methylmercury via dermal absorption. There is extremely important hazard assessment informati on on the dermal absorption of dialkylmercurials. A case history indicates nearly complete absorption of dimethylmercury through the skin resulting in a highly toxic exposure pathway. The exposure occurre d to a 48-year-old female chemistry professor who was admitted to the hospital 5 months (154 days) after she inadvertently spilled several drops (estimated at 0.4-0.5 mL) of dimethylmercury from the tip of her pi pette onto the back of her disposable latex gloves MERCURY 170 2. HEALTH EFFECTS (Blayney et al. 1997; Nierenberg et al. 1998). The spill was cleaned and the gloves disposed of. Hair analysis on a long strand of hair revealed that, after a brief lag time, mercury content rose rapidly to almost 1,100 ppm (normal level <0.26 ppm, toxic level >50 ppm), and then slowly declined, with a half-life of 74.6 days. These results support the occurrence of one or several episodes of exposure, and are consistent with laboratory notebook accounts of a single accidental e xposure. Testing of family members, laboratory coworkers, and laboratory surfaces also failed to re veal any unsuspected mercury spills or other cases of toxic blood or urinary mercury levels. Permeation test s subsequently performed on disposable latex gloves similar to those the patient had worn at the time of the lone exposure revealed that dimethylmercury penetrates such gloves rapidly and completely, with penetration occurring in 15 seconds or less and perhaps instantly. Severe neurotoxicity developed 5 m onths postexposure and the patient died 9 months postexposure. The mercury content of hair, blood, and urine were monitored from 5 months postexposure (i.e., following admission of the patient to the hospital) until the patient died. Based on the half-lives and kinetics of mercury in the body, the hair and blood leve ls were used to estimate the total body burden and the amount of the initial acute dermal dose. They determined that a dose of 0.44 mL of liquidDimethylmercury (about 1,344 mg), if completely abso rbed, would have been sufficient to have produced the levels observed in the patient. This amount is in good agreement with the patient's account and the laboratory records on the amount spilled. Some inha lation exposure, however, could also have occurred during the cleanup of the spill, so this finding needs additional confirmation. Infants exposed to diapers that had been treated w ith a phenylmercury fungicide exhibited higher urinary levels of mercury than unexposed infants (Gotelli et al . 1985). In rats, dermal absorption of phenylmercuric acetate from the vaginal tract was 75% of the dose w ithin 8 hours after administration (Laug and Kunze 1949). 2.3.1.4 Other Routes of Exposure There is some information on the subcutaneous inj ection of metallic mercury. Schwarz et al. (1996) describe a case history of a female nurse who accidentally plunged a mercury thermometer into her lefthand while shaking it. Radiographic imaging revealed that some liquid metallic mercury had infiltrated into the soft tissues of her palm (amount unspecified). The diffusely distributed mercury could not be removed surgically. No immediate follow-up mercury levels in blood or urine were reported. A slightly elevated blood mercury concentration (15 \u00b5g/L, toxic level >50) was reported 2 years after this event, which thenMERCURY 171 2. HEALTH EFFECTS declined (no reason provided). Other sources of me rcury could have caused the increase, so little can be concluded about how much of th e subcutaneous liquid mercury entered the systemic circulation. In a much more informative case history, a 19-y ear-old man had injected mercury subcutaneously (Bradberry et al. 1996). Blood and urine mercury c oncentrations were followed for 6 years after presentation. Hematological and biochemical profiles were normal. Histological results indicated a chronicinflammatory reaction with granuloma formation, sec ondary to the globular mercury. A postoperative X- ray of the elbow indicated persistent subcutane ous mercury particles. Apart from the initial local discomfort, the patient remained asymptomatic and clinical examination revealed no abnormality up to 6 years postsurgery. No systemic features of me rcury poisoning were evident. Blood mercury levels declined from 60 to 70 \u00b5g/L at 1 year postoperation to 10 \u00b5g/L at 6 years. Serial sampling results of total mercury in 24 urine collections indicated peaks up to 1.2 mg during the first year postoperation, which declined to 59 \u00b5g/L at 6 years. The elevated blood a nd urine levels indicate some systemic absorption. The effects of the surgery on migration of mercury from the subcutaneous tissue to the systemic circulation are not known. 2.3.2 Distribution In humans, metallic mercury is distributed thr oughout the body following inhalation exposure. It can readily cross the blood-brain and placental barriers because of its high lipophilicity. After oxidation tomercuric mercury, it accumulates primarily in th e kidneys. Inorganic divalent mercury compounds similarly reach all organs; however, the extent of accu mulation in the brain and fetus is lower than metallic mercury because of the lower lipophilicity of inor ganic mercury compounds. Organic mercury compounds distribute throughout the body following oral exposure and have the highest accumulation in the kidneys. As with metallic mercury, the ability of methyl- and phenyl mercury compounds to cross the blood-brain and placental barriers allows distribution, and sub sequent accumulation, in the brain and fetus. 2.3.2.1 Inhalation Exposure Metallic Mercury. The lipophilic nature of metallic mercury results in its distribution throughout the body. Metallic mercury in solution in the body is highly lipophilic, thereby allowing it to cross blood-brain and placental barriers with ease (Clarkson 1989). Mercury distributes to all tissues and reaches peak levels within 24 hours, except in the brain where peak levels are achieved within 2-3 days (Hursh et al. 1976). MERCURY 172 2. HEALTH EFFECTS The longest retention of mercury after inhalation of mercury vapor occurs in the brain (Takahata et al. 1970). Japanese workers who died 10 years after their last exposure to metallic mercury vapors still hadhigh residual levels of mercury in their brains (Tak ahata et al. 1970). Autopsies of 3 dentists revealed 0.945-2.110 mg Hg/kg in the renal cortex, compared to 0.021-0.810 mg Hg/kg for unexposed controls(Nylander et al. 1989). In volunteers who inhaled a tracer dose of metallic merc ury vapor for 20 minutes, approximately 2% of the absorbed dose was deposited per liter of whole blood afte r the initial distribution was complete (Cherian et al. 1978). Uptake into the red blood cells was comple te after 2 hours, but plasma uptake was not complete until after 24 hours. Mercury concentration in red blood cells was twice that measured in the plasma. This ratio persisted for at least 6 days after exposure. However, the ratios of 1-2 have been reported for metallic mercury vapor (Miettinen 1973). Exposure of rats to mercury vapor (10-100 \u00b5g/m 3) for 6 hours a day, 5 days a week from the 4th through 11th weeks of life resulted in measurable amounts of mercury in the blood, hair, teeth, kidneys, brain,lungs, liver, spleen, and tongue, with the kidney cortex having the highest mercury concentration (Eide and Wesenberg 1993). Further, tissue concentrations were positively and significantly correlated with exposure concentrations. In this study, the rat molars were found to have the highest correlation coefficient with measured kidney mercury values, leading to a suggestion by the authors that human deciduous teeth may beuseful indicators of chronic mercury exposure and of the mercury uptake by the kidneys and cerebrum (Eide and Wesenberg 1993). In another study, a 4-hour exposure of mice to metallic mercury vapor produced the highest mercury retention in the brai n compared to other organs (Berlin et al. 1966). Exposure of mice to metallic mercury vapor (8 mg/m 3, for 6 hours a day for 10 days) resulted in higher mercury levels in the gray than in the white brai n matter (Cassano et al. 1966, 1969). Exposure of rats to 1 mg/m3 metallic mercury vapor for 24 hours a day every da y for 5 weeks or 6 hours a day, 3 days a week for 5 weeks resulted in mean mercury brain concentr ations of 5.03 and 0.71 \u00b5g/g, respectively (Warfvinge et al. 1992). Mercury was found primarily in the neocor tex, basal nuclei, and the cerebellar Purkinje cells. Mercury also accumulates in several cell types populating the dorsal root ganglia (Schionning et al. 1991). After 12-14 hours of exposure of rats to a relatively small amount of metallic mercury vapor (0.55 mg/m3), accumulation of mercury was observed within all ce ll types examined (ganglion cells, satellite cells, fibroblasts, and macrophages). Mercury has also been detected in dorsal root neurons and satellite cells ofMERCURY 173 2. HEALTH EFFECTS primates exposed for one year to mercury through am algams in dental fillings or the maxillary bone (Danscher et al. 1990). The kidney is the major organ of mercury deposition after inhalation exposure to metallic mercury vapor. Mercury concentrations in the kidneys are orders of magnitude higher than in other tissues (Rothstein and Hayes 1964). Monkeys exposed for one year to meta llic mercury vapor from amalgam in dental fillings accumulated mercury in the spinal ganglia, anterior pituitary, adrenal, medulla, liver, kidneys, lungs, and intestinal lymph glands (Danscher et al. 1990). The largest deposits of mercury were found in the kidneys (2.5-5.2 ppm), specifically in the proximal tubule cells. The kidney contains metallothionein, a metal-binding prot ein that is also found in fetal and maternal livers and other organs. In the kidneys, the production of meta llothionein is stimulated by exposure to mercury. The increased levels of metallothionein increase the am ount of mercuric ion binding in the kidneys (Cherian and Clarkson 1976; Piotrowski et al. 1973). Three classes of sulfhydryl groups have been identified in the kidneys, with metallothionein having the greatest a ffinity for mercury (Clarkson and Magos 1966). Low molecular-weight complexes of mercury have been identif ied in the urine, suggesting that they may exist in the kidneys and contribute to the kidneys' accumulation of mercury (Piotrowski et al. 1973). Metallothionein exists in higher concen tration in the fetal liver than in the maternal liver of rats. Exposure to mercury in the pregnant dam results in the binding of mercury to metallothionein in fetal liver initially, followed by a redistribution to other organs (Yoshida et al. 1990). Meta llothionein and mercury levels were elevated in the kidneys of guinea pig neonates exposed to 6-10 mg/m3 mercury vapor (Piotrowski et al. 1973). After exposure to mercury vapor, mercury is distri buted throughout the body in different chemical and physical states. Metallic mercury dissolves in th e blood upon inhalation, and some remains unchanged (Magos 1967). Metallic mercury in the blood is oxidi zed to its divalent form in the red blood cells (Halbach and Clarkson 1978). The divalent cation exists as or nondiffusible form. Thenondiffusible form is mercuric ions that bind to prot ein and are held in high-molecular weight complexes, existing in equilibrium with the diffusible form. In the plasma, the mercuric ion is predominantly nondiffusible and binds to albumin and globulins (Berlin and Gibson 1963; Cember et al. 1968; Clarkson et al. 1961). Following mercuric salt administration,MERCURY 174 2. HEALTH EFFECTS levels of mercuric ions in the plasma are similar to le vels of mercuric ions in the red blood cells. Binding of mercury also occurs in tissues, and retention vari es, with the brain retaining mercury the longest. The influence of age on mercury distribution follo wing exposure to metallic mercury was evaluated in neonatal (12 hours old) and adult guin ea pigs exposed to 8 or 10 mg Hg/m3 vapor for 120 minutes (Yoshida et al. 1989). The mercury concentrations were 28, 58, and 64% higher in the brain, lungs, and heart, respectively, of the neonates compared to the mother s. However, the mercury level in the kidneys was approximately 50% lower in the neonates. The lower uptake of mercury in the kidneys of neonates may be due to the functional immaturity of the kidneys at parturition. The higher levels in other highly perfused tissues suggest that mercury accumulation in organs is dependent on how easily metallic mercury can reach the tissues from blood. Similar findings were reported by Jugo (1976) who found higher mercury concentrations in the liver, blood, and brain, but lowe r concentrations in the kidneys of 2-week-old rats compared to similar tissues in 21-week-old rats. These results also suggest that infants may accumulate mercury more readily after acute exposure and, therefor e, may be more likely to exhibit neurotoxicity from mercury vapors. The extent of mercury accumulation with aging was studied in mice maintained under normal care conditions in a conventional rodent colony w ithout exposure to known mercury sources other than background concentrations normally found in food, wa ter, and air (Massie et al. 1993). There was no significant change in the total amount of mercury in the organs (lungs, heart, brain, and liver) from male C57BL/6J mice ranging in age from 133 to 904 days. Howe ver, the ratios of mercury levels in the brain to mercury levels in the liver and kidneys were found to increase significantly and dramatically with age. The increase with aging in the brain-to-liver and brain-to -kidneys ratios suggests that mercury removal from the brain may be less efficient in some older organisms. Metallic mercury vapor easily penetrates the placental barrier and accumulates in fetal tissues. The high lipophilicity of metallic mercury favor s its penetration across the barrier. The uptake of mercury appears to increase during the later gestation period in mice, as indicated by increased mercury accumulation in the fetus after exposure to metallic mercury (Dencker et al. 1983). Guinea pig fetuses that were exposed to 6-13 mg/m3 mercury vapor during late gestation had elevat ed mercury concentrations in the liver, while the levels in other tissues were only slightly increased relative to controls (Yoshida et al. 1990). Newborn guinea pigs that were nursed by their mothers, w ho had been and exposed to mercury vapor (6-9 mg/m3) for 120 minutes immediately after parturition, had the highest mercury concentrations in the kidneys, MERCURY 175 2. HEALTH EFFECTS followed by the liver and lungs (Yoshida et al . 1992). In the brain and whole blood, mercury concentrations were slightly elevated compared to nonexposed controls. Levels of mercury in the fetus were approximately 4 times higher after exposure to me tallic mercury vapor than after mercuric chloride administration for mice and 10-40 times higher for rats (Clarkson et al. 1972). The transport of the mercuric ions is limited at the placental barrier by the presence of high-affinity binding sites (Dencker et al. 1983). Inorganic Mercury. No studies were located regarding the distribution of inorganic mercury in humans or animals following inhalation exposure to inorganic mercury compounds. Organic Mercury. No studies were located regarding the distribution of organic mercury in humans or animals following inhalation exposure to organic mercury compounds. 2.3.2.2 Oral Exposure Metallic and Inorganic Mercury. Data on the distribution of ingested elemental mercury were not located, and data on the ingestion of inorganic mercur y are limited. The metallic mercury that is absorbed from an oral exposure is expected to resemble many aspects of the distribution of mercuric salts because metallic mercury is oxidized to mercuric ion in biologi cal fluids, and the resulting distribution reflects that of the mercuric ion. Unlike elemental mercury, however, the amount of divalent mercury that crosses theblood-brain and placental barriers is much lower b ecause of its lower lipid solubility (Clarkson 1989). In some studies there is a combined exposure to both organic and inorganic mercury. Oskarsson et al. (1996) assessed the total and inorganic mercury conten t in breast milk and blood in relation to fish consumption and amalgam fillings. Total mercury c oncentrations were evaluated in breast milk, blood, and hair samples collected 6 weeks after delivery from 30 lactating Swedish women. In breast milk, abouthalf of the total mercury was inorganic and half was methylmercury, whereas in blood only 26% was inorganic and 74% was methylmercury. The results of a regression analysis for mercury in hair, blood, and milk indicated that there was an efficient transf er of inorganic mercury from blood to breast milk and that mercury from amalgam fillings was probably the main source of mercury in breast milk, whilemethylmercury levels in blood did not appear to be e fficiently transferred to breast milk. Exposure of the infant to mercury in breast milk was calculated to ra nge up to 0.3 \u00b5g/kg/day, of which approximately one- half was inorganic mercury. This exposure corres ponds to approximately one-half the tolerable daily MERCURY 176 2. HEALTH EFFECTS intake of total mercury for adults recommended by th e World Health organization. The authors concluded that efforts should be made to decrease total merc ury burden in women of reproductive age Oskarsson et al. (1996). Inorganic Mercury. The liver and kidneys of mice had the high est mercury levels 14 days after exposure to a single oral dose of 0.2-20 mg 203Hg/kg as mercuric chloride (Nielsen and Andersen 1990). The brain has substantially lower mercury leve ls; however, retention was longest in this tissue. Sin et al. (1983) report that the kidneys also had the highest mercur y levels following repeated oral exposure of mice to mercuric chloride (4-5 mg Hg/kg) for 2-8 weeks. Me rcuric sulfide did not accumulate in the tissues of mice to any significant extent following exposure to lo w levels of mercuric sulfide (4-5 mg Hg/kg) for 2-8 weeks (Sin et al. 1983). However, the mercury content in the liver and kidneys of mice treated withhigher doses of mercuric sulfide ( .8-200 mg Hg/kg/day) for 7 days was significantly increased compared to the controls (Yeoh et al. 1986, 1989). Mice fed mercuric sulfide (86 mg Hg/kg/day) for 1 week exhibited a 21-fold increase in the kidneys' mercury c ontent (p<0.001) and an 8.6-fold increase in the liver content compared to controls (Yeoh et al. 1989). Moderate renal effects, with a corresponding mercury concentration of 50 \u00b5g/g in the kidneys, were seen in rats exposed to mercuric nitrate (Fitzhugh et al. 1950). Mercury can accumulate in human hair following oral exposure to mercuric chloride (Suzuki et al. 1992). Hair mercury levels, determined using segmental ha ir analysis, can be used to monitor exposure to mercury and may leave a historical record of exposur e or uptake. In hair cut 41 days after mercuric mercury ingestion (13.8 mg/kg), a sharp peak (40 nmol/g [8 \u00b5g/g]) was found in the 1 cm segment closestto the scalp, while the levels were #5 nmol/g in all other segments. Ninety-five days after ingestion, the peak of inorganic mercury shifted to the 2-3 cm segme nt, while 160 days after ingestion the peak shifted to the 3-4 cm segment. During this time, the height of the peak decreased. An estimated biological half- life of inorganic mercury in hair was 57.8 days. Inorganic mercury in hair had different patterns of longitudinal variation from that of organic mercury. Organic Mercury. Distribution of organic mercury compounds in humans and animals is similar to that of metallic mercury. Methylmercury distributes readily to all tissues, including the brain and fetus, after absorption from the gastrointestinal tract. The uniform tissue distribution is due to methylmercury's ability to cross diffusion barriers and penetrate all membranes without difficulty (Aberg et al. 1969; Miettinen1973). Thus, tissue concentrations tend to remain c onstant relative to blood levels. About 90% of the MERCURY 177 2. HEALTH EFFECTS methylmercury in blood is found in the red blood ce lls (Kershaw et al. 1980). The mean mercury concentrations in red blood cells we re 27.5 ng/g and 20.4 ng/g in males and females, respectively, exposed to mercury, primarily from mercury-contaminated fish (Sakamoto et al. 1991). Because of this uniformdistribution in tissues, blood levels are a good indicat or of tissue concentrations independent of dose (Nordberg 1976). Although distribution is generally uniform, the highest levels of organic mercury are found in the kidneys (Nielsen and Andersen 1991b; Rice 1989b; Ryan et al. 1991). After a single oral dose of 0.04, 0.2, 1, or5 mg Hg/kg as methylmercuric chloride administered to mice, mercury was retained mostly in the kidneys and liver at 14 days postexposure (N ielsen and Andersen 1991a). The deposition of mercury in the carcass was about 70%, with retention primarily in the skin, hair, and muscles and to a lower degree in the fat and bones (Nielsen and Andersen 1991b). More than 200 days after cynomolgus monkeys were given 0.025 and 0.05 mg Hg/kg/day as methylmercuric chlori de in apple juice for about 2 years, the kidneys contained 10.18-27.89 ppm mercury in the cortex and 1.12-10.11 ppm in the medulla, compared to<2 ppm in the other tissues measured (Rice 1989b). Demethylation methylmercury to inorganic mercury accumulates in the ki dney and liver. Suda et al. (1991) evaluated the transformation of methylmercury to inorganic mercury by phagocytic cells. The liver and kidneys are also potential sites of biotransformation (Lind et al . 1988; Magos et al. 1976; Norseth and Clarkson 1970). The distribution of mercury in the brain has been st udied in humans following oral absorption of organic mercury. It is suggested by Aschner and Aschner (1990) that, following acute exposure to methylmercury, most of the total mercury in the brain is represente d by organic mercury; however, after chronic exposure, most of the mercury in the brain is inorganic mercur y. An explanation for these findings is that organic mercury is converted into inorganic mercury in th e brain. After chronic methylmercury exposure in monkeys, estimated half-lives were considerably longe r in brain than in blood, also possibly due to conversion of methylmercury to a form that is highly bound to brain tissue (Rice 1989b). The autopsy of a man whose first symptoms of methylmercury poisoning occurred 26 years earlier revealed that the highest mercury levels (0.62-1.19 \u00b5g Hg/g) were in the gyrus of the cerebral cerebellum, pallidum, and occipital pole of the brain (Takeuchi et al. 1989). Furthermore, total mercury levels (0.02-1.19 \u00b5g/g) were much higher than methyl mercury levels (approximately <0.01 \u00b5g/g) in the brain. MERCURY 178 2. HEALTH EFFECTS This finding supports the assumption by Suda et al. ( 1989) that ingested methylmercury is dealkylated to inorganic mercury in the brain. Monkeys were fed 0.05 or 0.09 mg Hg/kg/day as meth ylmercury, 0.5-1.5 years (Lind et al. 1988). The low-dosed monkeys were found to have 10-33% of the total mercury present in the inorganic form in brain cortices, while the high-dosed monkeys had 90% in the inorganic form. Demethylation of methylmercury in the brain, as well as in other organs, including the kidneys and liver, is believed to c ontribute substantially to the high c oncentration of inorganic mercury in the brain. Following oral exposure to methylmercuric chloride, regional distribution of total mercury in the brain of monkeys was observed; the highest leve ls were in the thalamus and hypothalamus (Rice 1989b). In contrast, in the brain of 21-day-old neonatal rats that had been previously exposed to a gavage dose of 6.4 mg Hg/kg as methylmercury chloride in utero , the cerebellum had the highest mercury concentrations and the brainstem had the lowest (Braghiroli et al. 1990). By 60 days of age, concentrations in the brain reached normal values, with an estimated half-lif e of approximately 37 days (Braghiroli et al. 1990). Therefore, age can affect regional distribution in the brain of animals. Massie et al. (1993) reported no significant change in the total amount of mercury in the organs (lung, heart, kidney, brain, and liver) of male C57BL/ 6J mice ranging in age from 133 to 904 days of age maintained under conventional conditions with no known source of mercury exposure other than background concentrations. The ratio of mercury in the br ain to that in the liver or to that in the kidney was significantly increased with age, indicating that ol der mice are less able to maintain a low brain-to- liver ratio of mercury regardless of the total body content of mercury. In a study of organs from sledge dogs fed methylme rcury-laden meat and organs from predatory marine animals (Hansen and Danscher 1995), the highest c oncentration of total mercury was found in the mesenterial lymph nodes, followed by liver and kidneys, indicating that the lymphatic system may play animportant role in the transport of mercury to target organs. The tissue concentrations of mercury observed in this study were found to be age -related, and the results suggest that demethylation takes place in all organs, except the skeletal muscle. Demethylation of methylmercury was found to be lower in the brain than in other organs (Hansen and Danscher 1995). Mercury accumulates in hair following exposure to me thylmercury in humans and mice (Grandjean et al. MERCURY 179 2. HEALTH EFFECTS 1992; Nielsen and Andersen 1991a, 1991b; Soria et al. 1992; Suzuki et al. 1992). Hair mercury levels, determined using segmental hair analysis, can be u sed to monitor exposure to mercury and may leave a historical record of exposure or uptake (Phelps et al. 1980; Suzuki et al. 1992). The concentration ofmercury in the hair is considered proportional to th e concentration of mercury in the blood. Correlations can be drawn to determine blood concentrations of merc ury relative to its concentration in the hair (see the discussion of the methylmercury MRL in Section 2.5). Mercury concentrations in maternal hair were significantly correlated with cord blood levels of me rcury in pregnant women who had frequently ingested whale meat throughout pregnancy (Grandjean et al. 1992) . The frequent ingestion of whale meat dinners during pregnancy and, to a lesser degree, the frequent consumption of fish, as well as increased parity or age, were associated with high mercury concentrati ons in cord blood and hair. The incorporation of mercury into hair is irreversible; the loss of hair mercury occurs as the result of hair loss (Nielsen and Andersen 1991b). As with metallic mercury, methylmercury can readily traverse the placental barrier. In humans with no known exposure to mercury, blood merc ury levels increased with advancing gestation such that the mean blood mercury level on admission for delivery (1.15 ppb) was significantly higher than that of the firstprenatal visit (0.79 ppb) (Kuntz et al. 1982). Cord blood levels were similar to maternal blood values in labor and postpartum. Concentrations of methylmercur y in the fetal blood are slightly higher than in the maternal blood (Inouye and Kajiwara 1988; Kuhnert et al. 1981). Following an oral dose of methyl-mercuric chloride during gestation, accumulation of me rcury was much greater in the fetal kidneys than in the maternal kidneys of guinea pigs (Inouye and Kajiwar a 1988). Mercury levels in the liver were slightly higher in the fetus compared to the dam when expo sed to organic mercury at late gestation but were similar at early gestation. Distribution of mercury in the maternal and fetal brains was uneven, with the highest concentrations in the neopallium, dience phalon, and mesencephalon and the lowest in the rhombencephalon. Exposure at later gestational week s resulted in higher concentrations for both maternal and fetal brains (Inouye and Kajiwara 1988). Methylmercury may also be secreted in mother's milk et al. 1973). Following intravenous of methylmercuric chloride (1.6 mg Hg/kg) to pre gnant mice on one of days 9-17 of pregnancy, methyl- mercury was readily transferred to the fetuses from the mothers more predominantly at the later gestational stage (Inouye and Kajiwara 1990). The placental transfer of methylmercury was more efficient comparedto the lactational transfer in rats exposed to meth ylmercury in the diet during 11 weeks prior to mating, during gestation, and during lactation (Sundberg and Oskarsson 1992). A higher concentration of mercury MERCURY 180 2. HEALTH EFFECTS in the brain in relation to the blood merc ury concentration was found after exposure in utero compared to exposure in milk. Mercury was present as methylme rcury in the blood of the offspring exposed only during gestation, indicating little or no demethylati on during the first 15 days after birth. However, inorganic mercury was present in the blood of offs pring exposed only through milk, probably resulting from demethylation of methylmercury in the dam a nd transport of inorganic mercury to the sucklings through milk. In animal studies, mercury transfer to and distribution in offspring depends on the form administered to the dam. Yoshida et al. (1994) administered either mercury chloride or methylmercury at 1 mg Hg/kg bodyweight to maternal guinea pigs (Hartley strain) vi a intraperitoneal injection 12 hours after parturition. Exposure of the offspring was studied on days 3, 5, and 10 postpartum. Concentrations of mercury were lower in the milk than in maternal plasma regardless of the form of administered mercury, but total milk mercury was higher in the dams given mercury chlori de. While the ratio of methylmercury to total mercury decreased in plasma from dams, it did not d ecrease in the milk. Regardless of the form of mercury given to the dams, the highest concentration of mercury in the offspring was found in the kidney, followed by the liver and the brain. Brain mercury, however, was significantly higher in the offspring ofmethylmercury-treated dams. Mercury levels in majo r organs of the offspring peaked at 5 days from mercury-chloride-treated dams and at 10 days from methylmercury-treated dams. Tissue distribution of phenylmercury is initially similar to methylmercury. One week after administration, the distribution pattern resembles that seen after ad ministration of inorganic compounds (Nordberg 1976). Once in the blood, phenylmercury distributes to a greater extent into the red blood cells than the plasma. Phenylmercury also predominantly distributes to the liver (Berlin 1963). It is less permeable to the placental and blood-brain barriers than methylmercur y (Yamaguchi and Nunotani 1974). Phenylmercury also accumulates in the fur of rats but to a lesser ex tent than detected with methylmercury exposure (Gage 1964). 2.3.2.3 Dermal Exposure No information was identified for distribution of metallic, inorganic, or methylmercury via dermal absorption. A case history for a dermal absorption of dimethylmercury (see Section 2.3.1.3) does providesome information on distribution (Blayney et al. 1997; Nierenberg et al. 1998). A 48-year-old femaleabsorbed approximately 0.4-0.5 mL of dimethylmercury (about 1,500 mg) through the skin on the dorsal MERCURY 181 2. HEALTH EFFECTS side of her hand. A preliminary laboratory report at 5 months after exposure indicated that the whole-blood mercury concentration was more than 1,000 \u00b5g/L (normal range, 1-8 \u00b5g/L; toxic level, >200 \u00b5g/L). Chelation therapy with oral succimer (10 mg/kg ora lly every 8 hours) was begun on day 168 after exposure. Whole blood concentrations rose to 4,000 \u00b5g/L after one day of chelation, and urinary mercury levels were 234 \u00b5g/L (normal range, 1-5 \u00b5g/L; toxic level, >50 \u00b5g/L). Chelation therapy continued up to the time of the patients death 298 days postexposure, with blood merc ury level falling to around 200 \u00b5g/L. Metal analysis of the patient's tissues revealed extremely high levels of mercury in the frontal lobe and visual cortex (average value, 3.1 \u00b5g/g). The mercury content in the brain was approximately 6 times that of the whole blood at the time of death, and was muchhigher than levels in the brains of nonmercury exposed patients (2-50 ppb). 2.3.2.4 Other Routes of Exposure Strain and sex differences were observed in rena l mercury accumulation 4 hours after a subcutaneous methylmercuric chloride injection (1 CBA/JN, C3H/HeN, and strains (BALB/cA, C57B L/6N, and ICR) of female mice (Tanaka et al. 1991). Mercury was distributed to the kidneys, brain, heart, lungs, liver, spleen, carcass, plasma, and red bloodcells of all mice tested. Strain and sex differences we re found in renal mercury content. In three strains (ICR, BALB/cA, and C57BL/6N), males showed higher renal mercury levels than females. Differences in tissue concentrations in different inbred mice strains were evaluated by Griem et al. (1997). Female mice from five different strains (C57BL/6, B10.D2, B10.S, A.SW, and DBA/2) received 3 weekly subcutaneous injections of 0.5 mg Hg/kg body weight for up to 12 weeks. Except for the thymus, in which mercury concentrations continued to increase, steady state levels were obtained in blood and liver after 4 weeks and in spleen and kidney after 8 weeks. In the closely related strains C57BL/6, B10.D2, and B10.S, which differ only or primarily at the major histocompatibility complex, mercury concentrations in blood and liver were about 2-fold lower and renal c oncentrations were from 3- to 5-fold lower than measured in A.SW, and DBA/2 strains. Mercury concen trations in the spleen of C57BL/6, B10.D2, B10.S mice were significantly higher than in the spleen of A.SW, and DBA/2 mice. The higher concentration ofHg in this immune system organ concentration of C57BL/6, B10.D2, B10.S correlates with the increased susceptibility of these strains to a mercury chloride-indu ced systemic autoimmune syndrome. The strains with lower splenic mercury are more resistant.MERCURY 182 2. HEALTH EFFECTS Treatment of mice with ethanol results in increased accumulation of mercury in the fetus (Khayat and Dencker 1982). The concurrent generation of NADP H during the oxidation of alcohol enhances the reduction of mercuric ion to metallic mercury, ma king it more favorable for permeating the placenta. Mercuric chloride's limited ability to cross the placenta l barrier was also demonstrated in an intravenous study using mice (Inouye and Kajiwara 1990). Follo wing intravenous dosing of mercuric chloride (1.4 mg/kg) to pregnant mice on 1 day between days 9 and 17 of pregnancy, mercuric chloride was transferred inefficiently to the fetus, being blocked al most completely by the fetal membrane. The mercury accumulated in the placenta and yolk sac but not in the amnion or fetal body (Inouye and Kajiwara 1990). A histochemical study demonstrated that mercuric mercury (Hg+2) was blocked in the proximal wall of the yolk sac. 2.3.3 Metabolism The available evidence indicates that the metabolism of all forms of mercury is similar for humans and animals. Once absorbed, metallic and inorganic me rcury enter an oxidation-reduction cycle. Metallic mercury is oxidized to the divalent inorganic cation in the red blood cells and lungs of humans and animals. Evidence from animal studies suggests th e liver as an additional site of oxidation. Absorbed divalent cation from exposure to mercuric mercury compounds can, in tu rn, be reduced to the metallic or monovalent form and released as exhaled metallic mercury vapor. In the presence of protein sulfhydryl groups, mercurous mercury (Hg+) disproportionates to one divalent cation and one molecule at the zero oxidation state (Hg0). The conversion of methylmercury or phenylmercu ry into divalent inorganic mercury can probably occur soon after absorption, also feeding into the oxidation-reduction pathway. Metallic and Inorganic Mercury. Metallic mercury vapor is inhale d through the lungs and rapidly enters the bloodstream. The dissolved vapor can undergo rapi d oxidation, primarily in the red blood cells, to its inorganic divalent form by the hydrogen peroxide -catalase pathway (Clarkson 1989; Halbach and Clarkson 1978). It is believed that the rate of oxidation is dependent on: (1) concentration of catalase in the tissue; (2) endogenous production of hydrogen pe roxide; and (3) availability of me rcury vapor at the oxidation site (Magos et al. 1978). In red blood cells in vivo , hydrogen peroxide produc tion is probably a rate- determining step because Nielsen-Kudsk (1973) found that stimulation of hydroge n peroxide production in red cells increased the uptake of mercury vapors in re d blood cells. After a low dose, the total mercury content in the blood is proportionately higher than (to the administered dose) after a high dose, indicating that a higher proportion of the lower dose is oxidized (Magos et al. 1989). The hydrogen peroxide-catalase MERCURY 183 2. HEALTH EFFECTS pathway in red cells may become saturated at highe r dose levels (Magos et al. 1989). This oxidation pathway of metallic mercury can be inhibited by etha nol since ethanol is a competitive substrate for the hydrogen peroxide catalase and, consequently, can bl ock mercury uptake by red blood cells (Nielsen-Kudsk 1973). The oxidation of metallic mercury may also occur in th e brain, liver (adult and fetal) (Magos et al. 1978), lungs (Hursh et al. 1980), and probably all other ti ssues to some degree (Clarkson 1989). In rat liver homogenates, hydrogen peroxide catalase is the predom inant oxidative pathway in tissues. Its capacity is very high. Unlike oxidation in red cells, the rate-limiting step in in vitro oxidation in the liver is dependent on the rate of mercury delivery to the enzyme (Ma gos et al. 1978). Unoxidized metallic mercury can still reach the brain because the oxidation of metallic mercur y is a slow process compared with the circulation time from the lungs to the brain (Magos 1967). In the brain, unoxidized metallic mercury can be oxidizedand become trapped in the brain because it is more di fficult for the divalent form to cross the barrier. Autoradiographic studies suggest that mercury oxidation also occurs in the placen ta and fetus (Dencker et al. 1983), although the extent of oxidation is not known. The rate of distribution of metallic mercury to the brain and fetus is probably nonlinear because the rate of oxidation in red cells is nonlinear (i.e., can become saturated at higher doses) (Magos et al. 1989). There is evidence to suggest that the divalent inor ganic mercury cation is reduced by mammalian tissue to metallic mercury after its oxidation. Rats and mice pret reated parenterally et al. 1981a ). Liver and kidney homogenates in animals also release mercury vapor after exposure to mercuric chloride. The amount of mercury released increases upon treatment with ethanol (Dunn et al. 1981b). This increase suggests that glutathionereductase is responsible for mercuric ion reducti on (Williams et al. 1982). Oxidation of alcohol to acetaldehyde stimulates NADPH production, which is required for mercuric ion reduction. However, alcohol is primarily oxidized in the liver, and this location is not consistent with the increases in metallic mercury vapor released from the kidney homogenates (Dunn et al. 1981b). Organic Mercury. Once absorbed, methylmercury can apparen tly be converted into inorganic mercury in tissues, specifically the divalent cation (Hg +2) (Dunn and Clarkson 1980). Se veral investigators have reported high levels of inorganic mercury in ti ssues (Magos and Butler 1972; WHO 1990) and feces after methylmercury exposure (Turner et al. 1975). Rat liver microsomes can degrade methylmercury intoinorganic mercury. Inorganic mercury production from methylmercury paralleled the hydroxyl radical MERCURY 184 2. HEALTH EFFECTS production (Suda and Hirayama 1992). The promotion a nd inhibition of the hydroxyl radical formation and the hydroxyl radical scavenger, affected inorganic me rcury production. These results suggest that hydroxyl radicals produced from microsomes may play a predominant role in alkyl mercury degradation. NADPH-cytochrome P-450 reductase is known to be r esponsible for hydroxyl radical production in liver microsomes. Alkyl mercury degradation varied in proportion to the enzyme activities and hydroxyl radical production. These results suggest that hydroxyl radicals produced by cytochrome P-450 reductase might bethe primary reactive species that induces alkyl mercury degradation. In vitro studies using a peroxidase- hydrogen peroxide-halide system indicated that besides the hydroxyl radical, hypochlorous acid (HOCl)scavengers are also capable of degrading methyl mercury (Suda and Takahashi 1992). Also, metallic mercury exhaled in mice dosed with methylmercury was dependent on the level of inorganic mercury present in the tissue (Dunn and Clarkson 1980). The cati on then enters the oxidation-reduction cycle, and metabolism occurs as discussed previously under Inorganic Mercury. A small amount of an oral dose of methylmercuric chlo ride can also be converted into inorganic mercury in the intestinal flora (Nakamura et al. 1977; Rowland et al. 1980). However, inorganic mercury is poorlyabsorbed across the intestinal wall and, therefore, most of it is excreted. Phenylmercury also rapidly metabolizes to inorgani c mercury (Nordberg 1976). The metabolism of phenyl- mercury involves hydroxylation of the benzene ring to an unstable metabolite that spontaneously releases inorganic mercury. Consequently, its tissue di sposition following initial metabolism resembles that seen after the administration of inorganic salts (Gage 1973). Studies in mice indicate that toxicity from exposure to dimethylmercury is the result of metabolic conversion of dimethylmercury to methylmercury, a nd that dimethylmercury does not enter the brain until it has been metabolized to methylmercury, which o ccurs over the first several days following absorption (Ostland 1969). Nierenberg et al. (1998) report the results of an analyses of mercury content in the hair of a 48-year-old female who died subsequent to an acu te exposure to dimethylmercury. The results are consistent with the kinetic profiles for methylmercur y, and support the hypothesis of a rapid conversion of dimethylmercury to a methylmercury metabolite. MERCURY 185 2. HEALTH EFFECTS 2.3.4 Elimination and Excretion Elimination of metallic mercury occurs through the urin e, feces, and expired air, while inorganic mercury is excreted in the urine and feces in humans. Animal da ta on excretion are limited but indicate that excretion is species and dose dependent. The feces are a major elimination route for inorganic mercury compounds,but high acute doses increase the percentage of excretion via the urine. Excretion of organic mercury ispredominantly thought to occur through the fecal (biliary ) route in humans. In animals, phenylmercury is excreted initially though the bile and then shifts to urine, whereas methylmercury is primarily excreted in the bile and then the feces. Age is a factor in the elimination of mercury in rats following inorganic and organic mercury exposure, with younge r rats demonstrating significantly higher retention than older rats. Both inorganic and organic mercury compounds can be excreted in breast milk. There are no datasuggesting that the route of exposure affects the ultim ate elimination of inorganic and organic mercury that is absorbed into the body. Metallic and Inorganic Mercury. The urine and feces are the main excretory pathways of metallic and inorganic mercury in humans, with a body burden ha lf-life of approximately 1-2 months (Clarkson 1989). In a study of former chloralkali workers exposed to metallic mercury vapor for 2-18 years (median, 5 years), Sallsten et al. (1995) found that the elimina tion of mercury in urine was well characterized by a one-compartment model, which estimated a half-life of 55 days. There was a tendency toward longer half- lives with shorter duration exposures than with long- term exposure, when uptake and elimination have reached a steady state. This might be due to the i nduction of a higher metabolic rate after a longer exposure time, but there is no experimental evidence to support su ch an effect (Sallsten et al. 1995). For high-level exposure to inorganic divalent mercury, the urine is probably the major elimination route, with a half-life similar to that of metallic mercury (Clarkson 1989). An elimination half-life from urine was estimated to be 25.9 days following an acute exposure to a high level of mercuric chloride (13.8 mg/kg) (Suzuki et al. 1992). Exhalation in the lungs and secretion in saliva, bile, and sweat may also contribute a small portion to the excretion process (Joselow et al. 1968b; Lovejo y et al. 1974). After an acute mercury exposure in humans, urinary excretion accounts for 13% of the tota l body burden. After long-term exposure, urinary excretion increases to 58%. Humans inhaling mercury vapor for less than an hour expired approximately 7% of the retained dose of mercury (Cherian et al. 1978; Hursh et al. 1976). The half-life for thiselimination pathway was 14-25 hours; therefore, excreti on through expired air is ne gligible 5-7 days after exposure (Cherian et al. 1978). Using a two-compartm ent model, elimination half-lives in the urine of workers exposed for 20-45 hours to >0.1 mg/m 3 metallic mercury vapor were MERCURY 186 2. HEALTH EFFECTS estimated to be 28 and 41 days for a fast and slow phase, respectively (Barregard et al. 1992). Mercury is excreted in the urine following oral exposure to me rcuric sulfide (0.5 mg Hg/kg) (Yeoh et al. 1989). The overall elimination rate of inorganic mercury from the body is the same as the rate of elimination from the kidneys, where most of the body burden is localized (see Table 2-4). Inorganic mercury is also readilycleared from the lung. Elimination from the blood and the brain is thought to be a biphasic process with aninitial rapid phase in which the decline in the body burde n is associated with high levels of mercury being cleared from tissues, followed by a slower phase of mercury clearance from th e same tissues (Takahata et al. 1970). An even longer terminal-elimination phase is also possible because of persistent accumulation of mercury, primarily in the brain (Takahata et al. 1970). Following a single oral dose of divalent mercury in10 volunteers, 85% of the 203Hg activity was excreted within 4-5 days, predominantly in the feces (Rahola et al. 1973). Following acute mercury vapor intoxication of two hum ans, it was found that, despite chelation therapy with multiple chelators (2,3-dimercaptopropanol [BAL] followed by 2,3-dimercaptosuccoinic acid [DMSA]), relatively high concentrations of mercury re mained in the plasma for a very long time (Houeto et al. 1994). The authors suggested that this could be explained by the progressive release of mercury from red blood cells and tissues after oxidation. In a group of chloralkali workers exposed to metallic mercury vapor for 1-24 years (median, 10 years), a decrease in the mercury concentration (following temporarydiscontinuation of exposure) in whole blood, plasma, and erythrocytes was found to be best characterized by a two-compartment model (Sallsten et al. 1993). Using a two-compartment model, half-lives were estimated, respectively, to be 3.8 and 45 days for the fast and slow phase in whole blood; plasma, 2 and36 days in plasma, and 3.6 and 16 days in erythrocytes. The half-lives for the slow phases in whole bloodand plasma were longer, and the relative fractions of the slow phases were higher (about 50%) after long- term exposures than after brief exposures (Sallsten et al. 1993). Workers exposed to vapors of 0.016-0.68 mg Hg/m 3 had detectable levels of mercury in the urine (>2 \u00b5g Hg/L) (Stopford et al. 1978). Metallic mercury accounted for <1% of the total mercury in the urine. The rapid appearance of metallic mercury in the urine is probably due to mercury filtered directly from the blood through the glomerulus, whereas mercuric ions found in the urine are attributable to themercury taken up by the kidneys prior to excretion. Therefore, urinary metallic mercury provides a relative index for blood levels of metallic me rcury, and urinary mercuric ions provide a relative index for kidney levels of inorganic mercury. Three different form s of mercury have been identified in the urine from MERCURY 188 2. HEALTH EFFECTS workers occupationally exposed to mercury: a metallic form, a mercuric-cysteine complex that is reducible, and a large complex in which the mercury can only be released by organic destruction (Henderson et al. 1974). Data are limited on elimination of me tallic and inorganic mercury in animals. Initial excretion of mercury is predominantly in the fecal matter following i nhalation of metallic mercury vapor, but as mercury concentrations increase in the kidneys, urinary ex cretion increases (Rothstein and Hayes 1964). After inhalation, approximately 10-20% of the total excreted metallic mercury is by exhalation (Rothstein and Hayes 1964). Mercury is excreted in the urine of mice exposed orally to mercuric sulfide (.8-200 mg Hg/kg) (Yeoh et al. 1986, 1989). The amount of mercury in the urine of the treated group was 4.5-15-fold greater than the control levels. Urin ary rates of mercury excretion were 1.6-2.2 ng/hour. Neonatal rats (1, 8, and 15 days old) eliminated mercury slower than ol der rats (22 and 29 days old) given mercuric chloride subcutaneously (Daston et al. 1986). Inorganic mercury is also excreted in breast milk (Y oshida et al. 1992). Newborn guinea pigs were exposed to inorganic mercury in breast milk from mothers exposed to mercury vapor (6-9 mg/m3) for 120 minutes after parturition (Yoshida et al. 1992). Mercury concen trations in breast milk were slightly lower than plasma mercury concentrations of the maternal guinea pigs over the observation period. Ratios of milk to plasma were 0.24-0.44 on day 3, 0.45-0.46 on day 5, and 0.46-0.66 on day 10. The decrease in themercury concentration in breast milk with time was slower than that in maternal plasma. The distribution of mercury to organs in the suckling neonates indicated that they were exposed to the inorganic rather than to elemental mercury. Sundberg et al. (1998) studied the elimination of radiolabeled inorganic mercury in lactating and nonlactating mice exposed to mercuric chloride via a single intravenous injection at 0.5 mg Hg/kg body weight. A three-compartment pharmacokinetic model w as used to fit the data. The study was designed to provide additional information on the speciation of mercury in breast milk and the differences between methylmercury and inorganic mercury migration into milk. Unlike placenta, where methylmercury moves more easily across the placental border than inorga nic mercury, inorganic mercury is more readily eliminated in milk than methylmercury. For inor ganic mercury, no significant differences were observed between lactating and nonlactating mice for plasma clearance (43.3 and respectively) of terminal half-lives of inorganic mercury in plasma were297 hours for lactating, and 162 hours for nonlactating mice. The milk-to-plasma concentration ratio MERCURY 189 2. HEALTH EFFECTS for inorganic mercury varied between 0.1 and 3.6, w ith a mean of 0.64 at plasma levels below 300 ng Hg/g (in the linear region of the relationship) and a mean of 0.17 at higher plasma mercury levels. In contrast, the values for the methylmercury kinetic parameters we re significantly higher in lactating than nonlactating mice: plasma clearance (93.5 and 47.1 mL/hour/kg, respectively) and volume of distribution (18,500 and9,400 mL/kg, respectively). The terminal half-life of methylmercury in plasma was 170 hours for lactatingand 158 hours for nonlactating mice. The milk-to- plasma concentration ratios for total mercury aftermethylmercury administration were lower than tho se seen with inorganic mercury, and varied between 0.1 and 0.7 with a mean of 0.20. The nearly five-fo ld higher peak value for plasma to blood mercury levels observed for inorganic mercury reflects the more e fficient migration of inorganic mercury from blood to milk compared with that for methylmercury. Mercur y concentrations in milk also decreased more quickly for inorganic (terminal half-life of 107 hours) than fo r methylmercury (constant levels throughout the 9-day follow-up period postexposure). The authors hypothesi ze that the nonlinear relationship between mercury in milk and plasma following inorganic mercury admini stration suggests that inorganic mercury enters the mammary gland via a carrier-mediated transport system th at is saturated at high plasma levels of inorganic mercury. The results suggest that the physiological changes during lactation alter the pharmacokinetics for methylmercury in mice, but not for inorganic mercury. Organic Mercury. The fecal (biliary) pathway is the predominant excretory route for methylmercury, with less than one-third of the total mercury excretion o ccurring through the urine, following oral and inhalation exposure (Norseth and Clarkson 1970). In humans, nearly all of the total mercury in the feces after organic mercury administration is in the inorganic form. Th e conversion of methylmercury to inorganic mercury is a major step that is dependent on the duration of e xposure and/or the duration after cessation of exposure. In rats and nonhuman primates, methylmercury is secreted in the bile and can be r eabsorbed in the intestine (Berlin et al. 1975; Norseth and Clarkson 1971; Urano et al. 1990). believed that methylmercury is complexed to nonprotein sulfhydryl compounds in the b ile and reabsorbed in this form by a transport system (Ballatori and Clarkson 1982; Urano et al. 1990) . In guinea pigs, hamsters, and monkeys, methyl- mercury, but not inorganic mercury, is extensively reabsorbed from the gall bladder, providing evidence for the biliary-hepatic recycling of this metal (Dutczak et al. 1991). The biliary-hepatic cycle probably contributes to the long biological half-life and toxicity of methylmercury. However, methylmercury can be converted into its inorganic form in the gastrointes tinal lumen by intestinal flora (Nakamura et al. 1977; MERCURY 190 2. HEALTH EFFECTS Rowland et al. 1980), thus decreasing reabsorption and increasing the rate of fecal excretion (Berlin et al. 1975). During the first few days after intravenous dosing, phenylmercury compounds are also eliminated primarily in the feces as a result of biliary secretion and its con centration in the gastroint estinal tract (mucosa and lumen) Ullberg 1963). The initial urinary excretion of phenylmercury represents primarily the parent compound (Gage 1964). Several da ys after exposure, however, elimination is primarily in the urine, which contains predominantly inorga nic mercury (Gotelli et al. 1985). Clearance half-times are longer with methylmercury than with inorganic compounds (see Table 2-5). Elimination of methylmercury compounds generally follows first-order kinetics because excretion is directly proportional to body burden a nd independent of the route of administration (oral or intraperitoneal) (Nielsen and Andersen 1991a). Furthermore, dura tion of exposure may affect the excretion process of mercury. A two-compartment model was established by Rice et al. (1989) for a single oral dose study inmonkeys because of the appearance of an initial rapid elimination phase followed by a slower elimination phase. However, following repeated dosing for 2 year s, a one-compartment model was considered a more reasonable fit for the data. Therefore, it was conc luded that the average steady-state blood levels of mercury after chronic-duration exposure should not be es timated on the basis of short-term exposure data. Elimination rates for methylmercury vary with species, dose, sex, and strain (Nielsen 1992). There is also evidence of sex-related differences in the eliminati on of methylmercury in humans (Miettinen 1973). The direction of the sex-related difference may differ fo r the fast and slow components of methylmercury elimination, with males excreting faster during the f ast component and females excreting faster during the slow component. The net difference in elimination rates at time points distant from exposure indicates thatfemales excrete methylmercury slightly faster than males. This net difference is seen in whole-body biological half-time derived by combining both fast and slow elimination components (Miettinen 1973). Clear sex-related differences were not reported for th ese volunteers for time points soon after exposure. In contrast, male mice excreted methylmercury much faster than females did for the first 14 days (i.e.,primarily the fast component) (Nielsen 1992). Signifi cant sex-related differences in elimination were also observed in rats dosed at 56 days of age (Thomas et al. 1982). As is apparently the case in humans, the difference was measured in the slow component only, with males excreting slightly slower than females. It should be noted that an insignificant difference in elimination was measured for the fast component of MERCURY 192 2. HEALTH EFFECTS excretion in the rats, with males excreting slightly f aster than females. Interestingly, a sex-difference elimination rate was not observed in rats do sed at 24 days or younger (Thomas et al. 1982). The rate of mercury excretion was also slower in younger animals (7 or 15 days) than in older animals (24 and 56 days) (Thomas et al. 1982). This age-dependent difference in the rate of mercury excretion may reflect differences in the sites of mercury deposition (i.e ., hair, red blood cells, skin). In neonatal rats, the excretion of methylmercury is longer than in adult rats because of the inability of the neonatal liver to secrete the toxicant into the bile. Therefore, the immatu rity of the transport system in neonatal rats affects the elimination of mercury. Methylmercury is also excreted in the breast m ilk of rats, humans, and guinea pigs (Sundberg and Oskarsson 1992; Yoshida et al. 1992). In pups exposed only through milk, approximately 80% of the total mercury in blood was present as methylmercury. Because suckling animals have a limited ability todemethylate methylmercury, the inorganic mercury present in the blood of the offspring probably originatedfrom inorganic mercury in the milk. Since the dams were exposed only to methylmercury in their diet, some demethylation occurred in the dams, followed by the transport of the inorganic mercury to the sucklings via milk. Sundberg et al. (1998) studied the elimination of radi olabeled methylmercury in lactating and nonlactating mice exposed to methylmercuric chloride via a single intravenous injection at 0.5 mg Hg/kg body weight. A comparison of the results for methylmercury with r esults for inorganic mercury is discussed in the section above on elimination of \"Inorganic Mercury.\" A thr ee compartment pharmacokinetic model was used to fit the data. The values for the methylmercury kinetic pa rameters were significantly higher in lactating than nonlactating mice: plasma clearance (93.5 and 47.1 mL/hour/kg, respectively) and volume of distribution(18,500 and 9,400 mL/kg, respectively). The terminal half-life of methylmercury in plasma was 170 hoursfor lactating and 158 hours for nonlactating mice. The milk-to- plasma concentration ratios for totalmercury after methylmercury administration were lower than those seen with inorganic mercury, and varied between 0.1 and 0.7, with a mean of 0.20. Mercury concentrations in milk we re constant throughout the 9-day follow-up period postexposure. The results indicat e that physiological during lactation alter the pharmacokinetics for methylmercury in Models Physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) models use mathematical descriptions of the uptake and disposition of chemical substances to quantitativel y describe the relationships among critical biological processes (Krishnan et al. 1994). PBPK models are also called biologically based tissue dosimetry models. PBPK models are increasingly used in risk assessments, primarily to predict the concentration of potentially toxic moieties of a chemical that will be delivered to any given target tissue following various combinations of route, dose level, and test species (Clewell and Andersen 1985). Physiologically basedpharmacodynamic (PBPD) models use mathematical descriptions of the dose-response function to quantitatively describe the relationship between target tissue dose and toxic end points. PBPK/PD models refine our understa nding of complex quantitative dose behaviors by helping to delineate and characterize the relationships between: (1) the ex ternal/exposure concentration and target tissue dose of the toxic moiety, and (2) the target tissue dose and observed responses (Andersen et al. 1987; Andersen and Krishnan 1994). These models are biologically and mechan istically based and can be used to extrapolate the pharmacokinetic behavior of chemical substances from high to low dose, from route to route, between species, and between subpopulations within a species. Th e biological basis of PBPK models results in more meaningful extrapolations than those generated with the more conventional use of uncertainty factors. The PBPK model for a chemical substance is deve loped in four interconnected steps: (1) model representation, (2) model parametrization, (3) model simulation, and (4) model validation (Krishnan and Andersen 1994). In the early 1990s, validated PBPK models were developed for a number of toxicologically important chemical substances, bot h volatile and nonvolatile (K rishnan and Andersen 1994; Leung 1993). PBPK models for a partic ular substance require estimates of the chemical substance-specific physicochemical parameters, and species-specific physiological and biological parameters. The numericalestimates of these model parameters are incorporated with in a set of differential and algebraic equations that describe the pharmacokinetic processes. Solving these differential and algebraic equations provides the predictions of tissue dose. Computers then pr ovide process simulations based on these solutions. The structure and mathematical expressions used in PBPK models significantly simplify the true complexities of biological systems. If the uptake and di sposition of the chemical substance(s) is adequately described, however, this simplification is desirable because data are often unavailable for many biological processes. A simplified scheme reduces the magnitude of cumulative uncertainty. The adequacy of the MERCURY 194 2. HEALTH EFFECTS model is, therefore, of great importance, and model va lidation is essential to the use of PBPK models in risk assessment. PBPK models improve the pharmacokinetic extrapola tions used in risk assessments that identify the maximal (i.e., the safe) levels for human exposure to chemical substances (Andersen and Krishnan 1994). PBPK models provide a scientifically sound means to pr edict the target tissue dose of chemicals in humans who are exposed to environmental levels (for example, levels that might occur at hazardous waste sites) based on the results of studies where doses were highe r or were administered in different species. Figure 2-4 shows a conceptualized representation of a PBPK model. PBPK models for mercury exist, and the overall results and individual models are discussed in this section in terms of their use in risk assessment, tissue dosim etry, and dose, route, and species extrapolations. 2.3.5.1 Summary of PBPK Models Two physiologically based pharmacokine tic models have been developed recently that model the kinetics of methylmercury in rats. Farris et al. (1993) deve loped a PBPK model that simulates the long-term disposition of methylmercury and its primary biotrans formation product, mercuric mercury, in the male Sprague-Dawley rat following a single oral nontoxic expos ure. Gray (1995) developed a PBPK model that simulates the kinetics of methylmercury in the pregna nt rat and fetus. The Gray model was developed to provide fetal and maternal organ methylmercury c oncentration-time profiles for any maternal dosing regimen. These model provide useful insight into the key physiological processes that determine thedistribution and fate of mercury in the body, but ne ither model is currently being used in human risk assessment. 2.3.5.2 Mercury PBPK Model Comparison Both the Farris et al. (1993) and the Gray (1995) PBPK models address the kinetics of methylmercury in rats. Both models provide useful insights into important physiological processes determining methyl- mercury distribution and changes in tissue concentr ations. Also, both studies suggest further work to enhance the utility and accuracy of the models The Fa rris et al. model dealt more effectively with the conversion of methylmercury to mercuric mercury, wh ile the Gray model specifically addressed fetal tissue concentrations as a function of maternal exposures a nd the extrapolation from short-term to continuous MERCURY 196 2. HEALTH EFFECTS dosing. The latter is of direct relevance to methylmercury risk assessments currently based on human studies of short-term exposures, while the general pub lic exposure is more typically continuous. Neither model ran simulations nor validated against data fo r other species (including human). Nor did the models address high-to-low dose extrapolations or different routes of exposure. 2.3.5.3 Discussion of Models The Farris et al. Model for Methylmercury. The Farris et al. (1993) model is a physiologically based model that simulates the long-term disposition of methylmercury and its primary biotransformation product, mercuric mercury, in growing mammals following a single nontoxic oral dose of the parent compound. The test animal used to develop and valid ate the model was the male Sprague-Dawley rat. A tracer dose was used in the validation studies to preclude the possibility that the results would be biased by toxic or saturation effects. The model incorporates a number of features, including a time-dependentcompartment for volume changes (i.e., the rats grew from 300 to 500 g in body weight over the 98-day time course of the validation study), compartment volume- dependent clearances, and the recycling of mercury from ingestion of hair by rats during grooming. Risk assessment. The Farris et al. model has not been used in human risk assessment. The authors, however, suggest that the model would be useful in developing a better understanding of species differences and in predicting the affects of altered biochemi cal or physiological states on methylmercury pharmaco- kinetics. For example, the authors suggest that the model can be adapted to simulate data for neonatal animals or humans that are known to secrete glutathione poorly. It could also help elucidate the mercurykinetics for animals that have altered bile flow or that have nonabsorbable sulfhydryl-containing resins. Description of the model. The Farris et al. model consists of nine lumped compartments, each of which represent a major site of mercury accumulati on, elimination, or effect in mammals. The compartment labeled \"carcass\" is a residual compartm ent and consists of a ll tissues and organs not specifically represented by the other eight compartments in the model. A flow diagram of the model is shown in Figure 2-5. The interdepartmental mass tr ansport parameters used in the model are shown in Table 2-6. Methylmercury transport between all compartments ex cept brain and hair is modeled as plasma flow limited (i.e., plasma levels rapidly equilibrate with erythr ocytes). Mercuric mercury transport parameters MERCURY 199 2. HEALTH EFFECTS the carcass, gastrointestinal tissue, skin, and kidne ys are assumed to follow a common mechanism and are based on the empirically estimated parameter for the kidneys. Transport of both organic and inorganic mercury to brain and hair compartments is assumed to be limited by the blood-brain barrier and the rate of hair growth. Recycled mercury from ingested hair during grooming was assumed available for reabsorption from the gut lumen at 100% for methylmercury and 10% for inorganic mercury. The authors make the assumption that all of the inorganic mercury resulting from the demethylation of methylmercury is mercuric mercury. Farris et al. (1993) note that the precise site of demethylation is unknown, although the body's tissues and the lumen of the gastrointestinal tract seem most likely. Forconvenience, however, they modeled demethylation entir ely in the liver compartment. Bidirectional and symmetric transport of methylmercury between the gut tissue and lumen is assumed and modeled accordingly. Biliary secretion of both methylmerc ury and inorganic mercury from biliary secre tion or from the gut tissue, is modeled as being readily reabsorbed. In line with previous studies, the m odel sets a value of 10% for resorption of inorganic mercury secreted into the bile or from exfoliation of the gastrointestinal mucosal cells. The assumptions in the model were incorporated into a series of mass-balance differential equations that account for the changes in the amount of methylmercur y and mercuric mercury in each compartment. The entire equation set was solved numerically using Gear 's method for stiff differe ntial equations (Gear 1971). The initial mercury dose was administered at 100% me thylmercury, administered as a bolus to the gut lumen compartment. The mass transport parameters listed in Table 2-6 were multiplied by the time- dependent compartment volumes to give the mass tran sport parameters used in the model equations. Validation of the model. The Farris et al. model simulations were compared to an extensive set of data collected by the authors on the metabolism and distributi on of an orally dosed bolus of radiolabeled methyl- mercury in male Sprague-Dawley rats. In a distribu tion study, tissue samples were collected on days 3, 7, 14, 21, 28, 35, 42, 49, 56, 63, 70, 77, 84, 91, and 98 post-dosing. In a metabolism study with the samedosing regimen, whole body counts and 24-hour feces a nd urine samples were collected daily for 15 days post-dosing, and then twice weekly. The model simulations were in close agreement w ith the observed results from the distribution and metabolism studies. Physiological processes that were hi ghlighted by the results and the discrepancies that MERCURY 200 2. HEALTH EFFECTS did occur include the probable active transport into th e brain (versus passive diffusion) of a methylmercury- cysteine complex, the bidirectional transport of me thylmercury between the gut lumen and gut tissue as a more important determinant of methylmercury fecal ex cretion than biliary secretion, the importance for the determination of methylmercury half-life in rats of the recycling of mercury from ingested hair, and the need for better estimates of the rate constants for the demethylation of methylmercury in order to adapt the model to other species. No human data were presented to validate the model, and validation was not performed for other routes or duration of mercury exposure. Target tissues. The target tissues for this model included the blood, liver, gut, kidneys, and brain. Species extrapolation. The model was developed and validated using the male Sprague-Dawley rat. No other species were tested and data from other species were not used to validate the model. The authors, however, suggest that this model would prove useful in developing better rate c onstants or other important determinants of species differences (for example, deme thylation rates, which differ based on differences in gut flora and tissue enzyme levels). High-low dose extrapolations. Only the single nontoxic dose was evaluated. No data were presented to evaluate the utility of the model for high-to-low dose extrapolations. Interroute extrapolation. Only the single oral dose was evaluated. No data were presented to evaluate the validity of the model in extrapolating from an oral to an inhalation or dermal dose. No compartment was included for the lungs. Although a skin compartm ent was included in the model, absorption from a dermal application of methylmercury was not addressed. The Gray Model for Methylmercury. The Gray (1995) PBPK model simulates the kinetics of methylmercury in the pregnant rat and fetus. The Gray model was developed to provide fetal and mate rnal organ methylmercury concentration-time profiles for any maternal dosing regimen. MERCURY 201 2. HEALTH EFFECTS Risk assessment. The Gray model has not been used in hum an risk assessment. The author, however, suggests that the model would be useful to incorpor ate rat developmental toxicity data into the assessment of methylmercury risk. Specifically, the author s uggests the model be used to convert the short-term exposure data from studies presently being used in risk assessments into continuous-exposure scenarios, which are more typical of the gene ral public's likely exposure pattern. Description of the model. The Gray model is a membrane-limited PBPK model for methylmercury developed using experimental data from the literature. The model para meters include constants for linear binding, membrane transfer, biliary transport, and gut reabsorption; and physiological parameters for tissue cellular and extracellular volumes and plasma flow rat es. Mass balance equations were developed that describe the transport to all organ systems important to the distribution or toxicity of methylmercury to thepregnant rat or fetus. Mass balance equations we re solved using an Advanced Continuous Simulation Language (ACSL) program developed by Mitchell and Gauthier Associates. The compartments and barriers to methylmercury tran sport in the tissue compartments and placenta are shown in Figure 2-6. The cell membrane is assumed to be the barrier for methylmercury transport for all tissues except the brain and placenta. The barrier to me thylmercury transport to the brain is the endothelial cell wall of the cerebral vascular system (the blood- brain barrier). The placenta is modeled as four compartments, with separate transfer constants for pl acental barrier and placental tissue transport. There is a tissue compartment for both the matern al and fetal sides of the placenta. The flow chart shown in Figure 2-7 illustrates the tr ansport pathways among the 8 compartments of the pregnant rat, the 5 compartments of the fetus, a nd the placental interface. The linear binding, membrane transfer transport, and secretion/reabsorption constants used in the Gray model are shown in Tables 2-7 and 2-8. The linear binding constants were estimated directly from in vivo tissue distribution studies using the ratio of tissue to plasma concentrations at pseudoequ ilibrium. They represent the degree to which methyl- mercury binds to intracellular sites. Because the skin (which includes the outer layers of hair and the pelt) contained excreted methylmercury that does not exch ange with plasma, the linear binding constant for a typical organ (in this case the liver) was used as the consta nt for skin. No experimental data were available for fetal red blood cell (RBC) binding, so the author made the assumption that the fetal RBC bindingconstant would be equal to the maternal RBC bindi ng constant. The conversion of methylmercury into mercuric mercury in the gut is not explicitly cal culated in the Gray model; instead, the calculated MERCURY 206 2. HEALTH EFFECTS reabsorption rate of secreted or shed methylmercur y in the gut implicitly accounts for the amount converted (i.e., the amount of demethylated mercury that subsequently would not be reabsorbed). Published data were used directly or to estimat e values for the maternal and fetal extracellular space, maternal plasma volume and flow expansion during pr egnancy, and maternal a nd fetal organ volumes and plasma flow. The model was run with a single intravenous bolus dose of 1 mg/kg at various times during a 22-day rat gestation period and compared with previously publis hed (different author) maternal and fetal organ concentrations. The model was also run with a daily dosing for 98 days, ending on Gd 20, to simulate a typical human dietary exposure pattern for a frequent consumer of methylmercury-contaminated food. Validation of the model. The Gray model simulations were validated against published values in the literature for mercury concentrations in maternal a nd fetal rat tissue from a variety of dosing patterns over the 22-day rat gestation period. Model-derived estim ates of methylmercury half-life in red blood cells of 14.8 days for the rat were consiste nt with published values from 14 to 16 days. Consistent values were also obtained for the timing of the peak mercury concentrati on in the brain. Model estimates were in agreement with published values for most tissue mercury concentr ations for dosing at various times, with percent differences generally <25%. Model estimates of ma ternal kidney methylmercury concentrations were consistently below published values, possibly due to an underestimate of the inorganic fraction of mercuric mercury in the kidneys. The model results for a total fetal methylmercury c oncentration of 0.79% 24 hours after maternal methyl- mercury dosing on Gd 19 compare favorably with pub lished values of 0.6 and 0.88% for administered doses on Gd 19 and 20, respectively. No human data were presented to validate the model, and validation was not performed for other routes of mercury exposure. Target tissues. The target tissues for this model included the blood, liver, gut, kidneys, and brain. Species extrapolation. The model validated the use of published data for the rat. No other species were tested, and data from other species were not u sed to validate the model. The author, however, MERCURY 207 2. HEALTH EFFECTS suggests that generally good agreement between the model simulated results and the published values indicate that the model accurately reflects the underlying biological processes and that scaling factors forspecies-to-species extrapolations should be considered. High-low dose extrapolations. No data were presented to evaluate the utility of the model for high- to-low dose extrapolations. A continuous exposure was simulated, but it was not validated against published data. Interroute extrapolation. Only the intravenous route of expos ure was evaluated. No data were presented to evaluate the validity of the model in extr apolating to an oral, inhalation, or dermal route of exposure. No compartment was included in the m odel for the lungs. Although a skin compartment was included in the model, absorption from a dermal application of methylmercury was not addressed. 2.4 MECHANISMS OF ACTION 2.4.1 Pharmacokinetic Mechanisms The absorption of metallic mercury through the lungs is by rapid diffusion. It is suggested that oral absorption of inorganic mercury compounds depends on thei r dissociation in the intestinal tract. In several cases, the underlying mechanism for the toxic effects of me rcury has been attributed to the high affinity of mercury for protein-containing sulfhydryl or thiol groups. The mechanism of absorption for metallic mercury va pors is rapid diffusion across alveolar membranes (Berlin et al. 1969; Clarkson 1989). Mercury distribu tion in the brains of mercury-sensitive SJL/N mice exposed for 10 weeks (5 days per week) to relatively high concentrations (0.5-1.0 mg/m 3) of mercury vapor was found to be affected by the magnitude of exposur e (Warfvinge 1995). In animals exposed to 0.5 mg/m3 for 19 hours a day or 1 mg/m3 for 3 hours a day, mercury was found in almost the entire brain, whereas in those exposed to 0.3 mg/m3 for 6 hours a day, mercury was primarily found in the neocortical layer V, the white matter, the thalamus, and the brain stem. In mice exposed to 1 mg/m3 for just 1.5 hours a day, the white matter and brain stem were the targets for mercury accumulation. These findings in mice weregenerally in agreement with brain distribution pattern s observed in mercury-sensitive rats (Schionning et al. 1991; Warfvinge et al. 1992), except that the white matter was not found to be a target for mercuryaccumulation. MERCURY 208 2. HEALTH EFFECTS Oral absorption of metallic mercury is low, possibly because of an in vivo conversion to divalent mercury and subsequent binding to sulfhydral groups, or possi bly because of poor absorption of the elemental form. For inorganic mercuric compounds, the low absorption in the lungs is probably due to the deposition of particles in the upper respiratory system that shoul d be cleared rapidly (Friberg and Nordberg 1973). Solubility and other chemical properties may also be factors in the absorption. The mechanism for intestinal absorption of inorganic mercuric mercur y may also involve the process of diffusion, and the absorption rate is proportional to the concentration of mercury in the lumen of the intestines (Piotrowski et al. 1992). The extent of transport of inorganic mercury across the intestinal tract may depend on its solubility (Friberg and Nordberg 1973) or on how easily the compounds dissociate in the lumen (Endo et al.1990). Absorption of mercurous compounds is less likely, probably because of solubility (Friberg andNordberg 1973) or its conversion into the diva lent cation in the gastrointestinal tract. The divalent cation exists in both a nondiffusible form (tissues) and a diffusible form (blood) (Halbach and Clarkson 1978; Magos 1967) (see Section 2.3.2). The mechanism for the distribution of mercury and its compounds probably depends on the extent of uptake of the diffusible forms into different tissues or on the mercury-binding to protein-binding sites (sulfhydryl groups) in red cells and plasma proteins (Clarkson 1972b). Mechanisms for the toxic effects of inorganic and orga nic mercury are believed to be similar. It has been suggested that the relative toxicities of the differe nt forms of mercury (e.g., metallic, monovalent, and divalent cations and methyl- and phenylmercury co mpounds) are related, in part, to its differential accumulation in sensitive tissues. This theory is supported by the observation that mercury rapidly accumulates in the kidneys and specific areas of the central nervous system (Rothstein and Hayes 1960;Somjen et al. 1973). The accumulation of methylmercury and inorgani c mercury in the brain of female monkeys (Macaca fascicularis) was studied by Vahter et al. (1994). In this study, animals received oral doses of 50 \u00b5g/kg/day for either 6, 12, or 18 months. In normal-weight monkeys (2.4-4.1 kg), a steady-state blood concentration for total mercury was attained in approxi mately 4 months. The elimination half-life in the blood was found to be 26 days. Accumulation in the brai n appeared to be biphasic, with an elimination half-life of 35 days for brain methylmercury in t hose monkeys exposed for 12 months. The elimination half-life of inorganic mercury, on the other hand, was reported be on the order of years. It was also found that inorganic mercury accounted for approximately 9% of the total brain mercury at 6-12 months, 18% at MERCURY 209 2. HEALTH EFFECTS 18 months, and 74% 6 months after termination of exposure. The authors stated that the presence of inorganic mercury in the brain was thought to be the r esult of demethylation of methylmercury in the brain. In heavier monkeys, there was a limited distribution of mercury in the fat. A finding of higher brainconcentrations in the heavy monkeys than in tho se of normal weight was probably due to higher blood mercury levels and a higher brain-to-blood distribution ratio. In vivo methylation of inorganic mercury, on the other hand, was not shown to occur in occupati onally exposed workers (Barregard et al. 1994a, 1994b), contrary to the findings of previous in vitro studies. Distribution of organic mercury is believed to involve complexes with proteins in the body. Methylmercury associates with water-soluble molecules (e.g., proteins) or thiol-containing amino acids because of the high affinity of the methylmercuric cation (CH 3Hg+) for the sulfhydryl groups 1990). Complexes of methylmercury with cysteine or glutathione have been identified in blood, liver, and bile (Aschner and Aschner 1990). The transport of methylmercury to the brain after subcutaneous injection appears to be closely linked to thiol-containing amino acids (Aschner and Clarkson 1988). The methyl- mercury cation can bind to the thiol group of the amino acid cysteine, forming a complex in which thevalence bonds link the mercury atom to adjacent iron and sulfur atoms at an 180 E angle, creating a chemical structure similar to that of the essential amino acid me thionine (Clarkson 1995). In such a manner, methyl- mercury can cross the blood-brain barrier \"disguised\" as an amino acid via a carrier-mediated system (i.e.,transport is not solely the result of methylmercury's lipid solubility). The uptake of methylmercury by the brain is inhibited by the presence of other amino aci ds such as leucine, methionine, phenylalanine, and other large neutral amino acids (Clarkson 1995). The mechanism by which methylmercury crosses the blood- brain barrier has also been examined in the rat using a rapid carotid infusion technique (Kerper et al . 1992). The results of this study also showed that methylmercury may enter the brain as a cysteine complex. The uptake of Me 203Hg complexed with either L- or D-cysteine was measured as a function of Me203Hg-cysteine concentration in the injection solution. There was a faster rate of uptake of Me203Hg- L-cysteine as compared to the D-cysteine complex. The nonlinearity of Me203Hg- L-cysteine uptake with the increasing concen tration suggests that transport of this complex is saturable, while the D-cysteine complex is taken up by simple diffusion. The mechanism for the distribution in the brain of inorganic mercury (resulti ng from the demethylation of organic mercury) is not well understood.MERCURY 210 2. HEALTH EFFECTS Strain and sex differences in renal mercury content in mice are attributable, in part, to differences in tissue glutathione content and to differences in renal -glutamyltranspeptidase activity, which is controlled, at least in part, by testosterone (Tanaka et al. 1991, 1992). The correlation of hepatic glutathione (or plasma glutathione) with the rate of renal uptake of methyl mercury suggests that methylmercury is transported to the kidneys as a glutathione complex (Tanaka et al. 1991). In addition to strain and sex differences in renal mercury content, it has also been demonstrated usi ng mice (133-904 days old) that the ratio of mercury in the brain to that in the liver and the kidneys increased significantly with age (Massie et al. 1993). In a study of the absorption of inorganic mercury by the rat jejunum, Foulkes and Bergman (1993) found that while tissue mercury could not be rigorously separated into membrane-bound and intracellular compartments (as can the heavy metal cadmium), its uptake into the jejunum includes a relatively temperature-insensitive and rapid influx into a pool r eadily accessible to suitable extracellular chelators. A separate, slower and more temperature-sensitive com ponent, however, leads to the filling of a relatively chelation-resistant compartment. Nonspecific memb rane properties, such as surface charge or membrane fluidity, might account for mucosal mercury uptake (Foulkes and Bergman 1993). 2.4.2 Mechanisms of Toxicity High-affinity binding of the divalent mercuric ion to th iol or sulfhydryl groups of proteins is believed to be a major mechanism for the biological activity of mercury (Clarkson 1972a; Hughes 1957; Passow et al.1961). Because proteins in both extracellular and intracellular membranes and organelles, and because most sulfhydryl groups play an integral part in the structure orfunction of most proteins, the precise target(s) for merc ury is not easily determined, if indeed there is a specific target. Possibilities include the inactivation of various enzymes, structural proteins, or transport processes (Bulger 1986); or alteration of cell membra ne permeability by the formation of mercaptides (Sahaphong and Trump 1971). Binding may also occur to other sites (e.g., amine, carboxyl groups) that are less favored than sulfhydryl groups. A variety of mercury-induced alterations are being investigated, including increased oxidative stress, disruption of microtubule formation, increased permeability of theblood-brain barrier, disruption of protein synthesis, disruption of DNA replication and DNA polymeraseactivity, impairment of synaptic transmission, membra ne disruption, impairment of the immune response, and disruption in calcium homeostasis. These altera tions may be acting singly or in combination. MERCURY 211 2. HEALTH EFFECTS Mercury has been shown to affect hepatic microsom al enzyme activity (Alexidis et al. 1994). Intra- peritoneal administration of mercuric acetate (6.2 \u00b5mol/kg/day) once daily for 6 days or once as a singledose of 15.68 \u00b5mol/kg resulted in an increase in kidney weight and a significant decrease in total cytochrome P-450 content. The single 15.68 \u00b5mol/kg injection resulted in the reduction of bothmicrosomal protein level and P-450 content, possibl y resulting from the generation of free radicals during the Hg ++ intoxication process. Through alterations in intracellular thiol status, merc ury can promote oxidative stress, lipid peroxidation, mitochondrial dysfunction, and changes in he me metabolism (Zalups and Lash 1994). HgCl2 has been shown to cause depolarization of the mitochondrial i nner membrane, with a consequent increase in the formation of H2O2 (Lund et al. 1993). These events are coupled with a Hg++-mediated glutathione depletion and pyridine nucleotide oxidation, creating an oxidant stress condition characterized by increasedsusceptibility of the mitochondrial membrane to iron- dependent lipid peroxidation. Lund et al. (1993) further postulated that mercury-induced alterations in mitochondrial calcium homeostasis may exacerbate Hg ++-induced oxidative stress in kidney cells. As a r esult of oxidative damage to the kidneys, numerous biochemical changes may occur, including the excreti on of excess porphyrins in the urine (porphyrinuria). In a study of the mechanism of porphyrinogen oxida tion by mercuric chloride, Miller and Woods (1993) found that mercury-thiol complexes possess redox activ ity, which promotes the oxidation of porphyrinogen and possibly other biomolecules. The steps between thiol binding and cellular dysfunction or damage have not been completely elucidated, but several theories exist. Conner and Fowler (1993) have suggested that following entry of the mercuric or methylmercuric ion into the proximal tubular epith elial cell by transport across either the brush-border or basolateral membrane, mercury interacts with th iol-containing compounds, principally glutathione and metallothionein. This interaction initially produces a lterations in membrane permeability to calcium ions and inhibition of mitochondrial function. Thr ough unknown signaling mechanisms, mercury subsequently induces the synthesis of glutathione, various glutathi one-dependent enzymes, metallothionein, and several stress proteins (Conner and Fowler 1993). In the kidneys , epithelial cell damage is believed to occur as the result of enhanced free radical formation and lipid peroxidation (Gstraunthaler et al. 1983). Treatment with mercury results in depletion of cellular de fense mechanisms against oxidative damage such and gl 1983). Further, enhancement of glutathione peroxidase has been observed in mercury-treated rats in direct relationship with kidney mercury content (Guillermin a and Elias 1995), but inhibition of renal redox cycle MERCURY 212 2. HEALTH EFFECTS enzymes in vivo did not appear to be a significant determinant of the increased lipid peroxidation observed during HgCl2-induced nephrotoxicity. The selenium-dependent form of glutathione peroxidase is highly sensitive to inhibition by mercury, and it has been propo sed that mercury interactions with selenium in the epithelial cells limit the amount of selenium available fo r this enzyme (Nielsen et al. 1991). Depletion of mitochondrial glutathione and increases in mitochondria l hydrogen peroxide at the inner mitochondrial membrane (Lund et al. 1991) may contribute to acceleration of the turnover of potassium and magnesiumobserved at this membrane (Humes and Weinberg 1983). Acute renal failure resulting from mercury exposure has been proposed to result from decreased re nal reabsorption of sodium and chloride in the proximal tubules and increased concentrations of these i ons at the macula densa (Barnes et al. 1980). This increase in ions at the macula densa, in turn, results in the local release of renin, vasoconstriction of the afferent arteriole, and filtration failure. These aut hors based this hypothesis on the observation that saline pretreatment of rats prior to mercuric chloride tr eatment did not prevent the proximal tubular damage but did prevent the acute renal failure. The saline pretreat ment was suggested to have depleted the glomerular renin and thereby prevented the cascade of events occu rring after accumulation of sodium and chloride ions at the glomerular macula densa (Barnes et al. A pivotal role for extracellular glutathione and membrane-bound -glutamyltransferase has also b een identified in the renal incorporation, toxicity, and excretion of inorganic mercury (HgCl 2) in rats (Ceaurriz et al. 1994). A similar mechanism for the promotion of neuronal de generation by mercury has been proposed (Sarafian and Verity 1991). Increases in the formation of reac tive oxygen species in several brain areas have been observed following intraperitoneal administration of me thylmercuric chloride to rodents (Ali et al. 1992; LeBel et al. 1990, 1992). A dissociation between incr eases in lipid peroxidation and cytotoxicity has been demonstrated by showing inhibiti on of the lipid peroxidation with -tocopherol without blocking the cytotoxicity (Verity and Sarafian 1991). These authors were able to show partial protection against the cytotoxicity with ethylene glycol tetra-acetate (E GTA), suggesting that increases in intracellular calcium may play a role in the cytotoxicity. They ultimat ely concluded that a synergistic interaction occurred between changes in intracellular calcium homeostasi s and intracellular thiol status, culminating in lipoperoxidation, activation ndonuclease activation, and phospholipid hydrolysis (Verity and Sarafian 1991). It has been suggested that neurons are highly sensitive to mercury either because of their low endogenous glutathione cont ent or their inefficient glutathione redox activity. Inhibition of protein synthesis has been reported in neurons from rats exposed to methylmercury (Syversen 1977). However, it is unknown whether this inhi bition is secondary to neuronal cytotoxicity.MERCURY 213 2. HEALTH EFFECTS At the functional level, both mercuric chloride a nd methylmercury have been shown to induce a slow inward current in patch-clamped dorsal root gangli on cells (Arakawa et al. 1991). The current does not appear to be mediated by either the sodium or calcium channels, but it may be activated by increases inintracellular calcium. Such slow inward currents s uppress voltage- and neurotransmitter-activated currents. Studies of the effects of inorganic mercury, methylmercury, and phenylmercuric acetate on synaptictransmission in rat hippocampal slices (Yuan and At chison 1994) revealed that the mechanisms that underlie the effects of various mercurials on central sy naptic transmission differ with respect to the sites of action, the potency, and the reversibility of the effect. Inorganic mercury (Hg ++) appeared to act primarily on the postsynaptic neuronal membrane, whereas the ac tion of methylmercury and phenylmercuric acetate was at both the pre- and postsynaptic sites but pr imarily on the postsynaptic membranes. Yuan and Atchison (1994) suggested that these differences may result, in part, from the differences in lipophilicity among the different mercurials studied. Differences in lipophilicity were also implicated by Roed and Herlofson (1994) as playing a role in the different effects produced by methylmercuric chloride and mercuric chloride. Roed and Herlofson (1994) that the high lipid solubility of methylmercuric chloride may divert that organomercurial to the mye lin of the nerve, where it very efficiently inhibits neuronal excitability. Further, they suggested that mercuric chloride probably causes inhibitory activity by binding to sulfhydryl groups in transport proteins that convey the messenger function of intracellular Ca++. This, in turn, leads to both inhibition of muscle contraction and enhancement of HgCl2-induced neuronal inhibition. The authors further suggest that HgCl2 inhibits an internal Ca++ signal necessary for choline re- uptake and acetylcholine resynthesis. Gallagher and Lee (1980) evaluated the similarity of inorganic and organic mercury toxicity to nervous tissue by injecting equimolar concentrations of both mercuric chloride and methylmercuric acetate directly into the cerebrum of rats, thereby circumventing sy stemic metabolic conversion pathways. The lesions induced by mercuric chloride were expected to ha ve been much greater after the mercuric chloride injection, since this process circumvents the necessity for biotransformation. However, the lesions were only slightly larger than those seen after methylmercur y injection, suggesting that there is a mechanism for organic mercury neurotoxicity that does not involve c onversion into inorganic mercury. This suggestion is supported by the findings of Magos et al. (1985) w ho failed to establish a correlation between neuronal, cytoplasmic, mercuric ions and neur onal degeneration, or clinical evidence of neurotoxicity. These results do not, however, preclude the possibility that intracellu lar transport of mercuric mercury may be limited, and the limitations on transport may determine the effects observed. MERCURY 214 2. HEALTH EFFECTS Recent data from an in vitro study suggest that mercuric mercury may be more effective than methyl- mercury in some paradigms. Using patch-clampe d dorsal root neurons, Arakawa et al. (1991) showed augmentation of the GABA-activated chloride current at extremely low mercuric chloride concentrations (0.1 \u00b5M), while a 1,000-fold higher concentration of methylmercury showed no such effect. The correlation between these effects observed in vitro and what may be occurring in vivo , however, is not known. The experimental data concerning the mechanism of action of methylmercury on the developing nervous system indicate that effects on the microtubules and amino acid transport are disrupted in neuronal cells before overt signs of intoxication are observed. V ogel et al. (1985) demonstrated the potent inhibitory effects of methylmercury on microtubule assembly at ratios stoichiometric with the tubulin dimer. Theeffects were thought to be mediated through MeHg binding to free sulfhydryl groups on both ends and on the surface of microtubules, which would provide multiple classes of binding sites for MeHg. Insubsequent in vitro studies, Vogel et al. (1989) identified a single high affinity class of binding sites on tubulin for methylmercury with 15 sites. The authors report that MeHg binds to tubulin stoichiometrically within microtubules, and does not induce microtubule disassembly at this low binding ratio. Free subunitsof tubulin, however, will act as uncompetitive inhib itors for MeHg binding to the polymer, and MeHg binding to the multiple sites in the free dimer blocks subsequent assembly. In contrast, the stoichiometric polymer surface binding sites for MeHg in microtubul es apparently do not inte rfere with subsequent polymerization. Mitotic inhibition from damage to and binding to tubulin has also beenreported by Sager et al. (1983). Comparison of the effects of mercury on structural elements and enzyme activities (Vignani et al. 1992) suggests that effects on cytoskeletal elements may be observed at lower concentrations than on enzyme activities. In the in vivo study by Sager et al. (1982), it was conc luded that methylmercury may be acting on mitotic spindle microtubules leading to cell injury in the developing cerebellar cortex. Cell injury observed in the external granular layer of the cerebella r cortex of 2-day-old rats was attributed to a reduced percentage of late mitotic figures (arrested cell division) due to the loss of spindle microtubules. Mitosisand migration of granule cells in the cerebellum end within weeks following birth; therefore, this observation may suggest potential differences in the sen sitivities of children and adults to mercury-induced neurotoxicity. The toxic effects of methylmercury on the developing nervous system may also be due to deranged neuronal cell migration (Choi et al. 1978; Matsumoto et al. 1965). Examination of the brains of two infants who died following in utero exposure to methylmercury revealed an abnormal pattern in the MERCURY 215 2. HEALTH EFFECTS organization and a distorted alignmen t of neurons in the cerebral cortex. Exposures first occurred during the critical period of neuronal migration (from gestation w eek 7 into the third trimester) in the fetus. Both could result from a direct effect of mercury on micr otubule proteins. Cell division and cell migration both require intact microtubules for normal functioning and, therefore, have been suggested as primary targets for methylmercury disruption in the developing ner vous system. It is hypothesized by Aschner and Clarkson (1988) that the uptake of methylmercury th rough the blood-brain barrier in developing and mature animals is closely linked to amino acid transport and metabolism because of the infusion of L-cysteine enhanced 203Hg uptake. The enhanced transport in the fe tus may be a result of the immaturity of the transport systems in the blood-brain barrier or of possible physical immaturity of the barrier itself. Methyl-mercury has also been shown to increase intracellular Ca ++ and inositol phosphate levels (Sarafian 1993). The observed stimulation of protein phosphorylation in rat cerebral neuronal culture was believed to be the result of elevation of intracellular second messengers (Ca++, inositol phosphate) rather than to a direct interaction between methylmercury and protein kin ase enzymes. This observation was considered to suggest a specific interference with neuronal signal transduction. The mercuric ion is also an extremely potent inhibitor of microtubule polymerization, both in vivo and in vitro (Duhr et al. 1993). Duhr and his colleagues further reported that the ability of Hg++ to inhibit microtubule polymerization or to disrupt already formed microtubules not only cannot be prevented bybinding with the chelating agents EDTA and EGTA, but that the binding of these two potent chelators potentiates the Hg ++-induced inhibition of tubulin polymerization by disrupting the interaction of GTP with the E-site of brain beta-tubulin, an obligatory step in the polymerization of tubulin. Mercury has been shown to inhibit a variety of enzy mes in the nervous system. The effects of mercuric chloride and methylmercuric chloride on the activity of protein kinase C in rat brain homogenate were studied by Rajanna et al. (1995). In this study, it was found that both forms of mercury inhibited protein kinase C activity in a dose-dependent manner at microm olar concentrations, with methylmercury being a more potent inhibitor than HgCl2. Mercuric chloride has also b een shown to cause the inhibition and ultrastructural localization of cerebral alkaline phosphatase (Albrecht et al. 1994) following a singleintraperitoneal injection of 6 mg HgCl 2/kg body weight. The observe d inhibition and subsequent translocation of alkaline phosphatase activity from th e luminal to abluminal site and the accompanying ultrastructural alterations were reported to be typi cal of the formation of \"leaky\" microvessels known to be associated with damage to the blood-brain barrier. Merc uric chloride has also been demonstrated to block the uptake of [3H]-histamine by cultured rat astroglia l cells and brain endothelia l cells (Huszti and Balogh MERCURY 216 2. HEALTH EFFECTS 1995). This effect was seen at mercury concentrations as low as 1 \u00b5M, and the inhibition was greater in astroglial cells than in the cerebral endothelial ce lls. At a concentration of 100 \u00b5M, however, HgCl2 caused the stimulation of histamine uptake, which was greater in the cerebral endothelial than in the astroglial cells. The mechanisms of these dose-dependent effects were considered to be different, with the inhibition of histamine uptake associated with the loss of the transmembrane Na+ and/or K+ gradient and the stimulation of histamine uptake by the higher mercury concentrati on being possibly related to a direct effect on the histamine transporter. Sekowski et al. (1997) used an intact human cell multiprotein complex (which they call a DNA synthesome) to evaluate the effects of me rcuric chloride on DNA synthesome-mediated in vitro DNA replication and DNA synthesis. The authors state th at the DNA synthesome has the advantage of providing the highly ordered environment in which DNA replicati on occurs while allowing more precise identification of the mechanism or site of effects than possible fro m the use of whole cells. The results showed that DNA replication and DNA polymerase activity, as well as DNA replication fidelity of the human cellsynthesome, were specifically inhibited by mercuric i on at physiologically attainable concentrations. The results suggest that mercuric ions (at concentrati ons above 10 \u00b5M) actively inhibit the elongation stage of DNA replication. It has been shown that Hg ++ promotes dose-dependent toxic effects on heart muscle through actions on the sarcolemma, the sarcoplasmic reticulum, and contractile proteins (Oliveira et al. 1994). In this study, inorganic mercury (HgCl2) was shown to have a dose-dependent e ffect on rat papillary muscle, with a concentration of 1 \u00b5M causing a small increase in the for ce of isometric contraction. Concentrations of 2.5, 5, and 10 \u00b5M produced a dose-dependent decrease in cont ractile force. The rate of force development, however, was effected differently, increasing at 1 and 2.5 \u00b5M Hg++ but decreasing to control levels at 5 and 10 \u00b5M concentrations. Oliveira et al. (1994) sugg ested that this response was due to an observed progressive reduction in the time to peak tension with increasing mercury concentrations, an effect they attributed to the binding of mercur ic ions to SH groups inducing Ca++ release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum, the activity of which itself was depressed by mercury in a dose-dependent fashion. Further, tetanic tension did not change during treatment with 1 \u00b5M Hg++ but decreased with 5 \u00b5M, suggesting a toxic effect on the contractile proteins only at high Hg++ concentrations (Oliveira et al. 1994). The molecular events leading to activation of the au toimmune response in susceptible individuals have yet to be fully elucidated. However, chemical modification of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class MERCURY 217 2. HEALTH EFFECTS II molecules or modification of self peptides, T-cell receptors, or cell-surface adhesion molecules has been suggested (Mathieson 1992). The immune suppressive effect of mercury has been examined in human B-cells (Shenker et al. 1993). This study showed i nhibition of B-cell proliferation, expression of surface antigens, and synthesis of IgG and IgM by both methylmercury and mercuric mercury. These chemicalscaused a sustained elevation of intracellular calcium. Based on concurrent degenerative changes in the nucleus (hyperchromaticity, nuclear fragmentation, and condensation of nucleoplasm) in the presence of sustained membrane integrity, the author suggested that the increase in intracellular calcium was initiating apoptic changes in the B-cells, ultim ately resulting in decreased viability. The glomerulopathy produced by exposure of Brown-Norway rats to mercuric chloride has been related to the presence of antilaminin antibodies (Icard et al. 1993). Kosuda et al. (1993) suggest that both geneticbackground and immune regulatory ne tworks (possibly acting through T-lymphocytes of the RT6 subset) may play an important role in the expression of autoi mmunity after exposure to mercury. A strain (Brown- Norway) of rats known to be susceptible to mercury- induced production of autoantibodies to certain renal antigens (e.g., laminin) and autoimmune glomerul onephritis was compared to a nonsusceptible strain (Lewis). Different responses to subcutaneous in jections of chloride regarding RT6 + T-lymphocytes subpopulation of lymphocytes consider ed to have possible immunoregulatory properties) were observed. While a relative decrease in RT6+ T-cells occurring with the development of renal autoantigen autoimmune responses was observed in th e mercury-treated Brown-Norway rats, the Lewis rats did not develop renal autoimmunity and were found to have undergone significant change in the RT6+-to-RT6+ T-lymphocyte ratio. When Brown-Norway-Lewis F1 hybrid rats were similarly dosed, effects similar to those in the Brown-Norway strain were seen, with the autoimmune responses to kidney antigens occurring concomitantly with a change in RT6 population proportionally in favor of T-lymphocytes that do not express the RT6 phenotype. Kosuda et al. (1993) proposed that there are bothendogenous and exogenous com ponents of mercury-induced autoimm unity. The endogenous (a genetically determined) component includes T-cell receptors, th e major histocompatibility complex, and an immuno- regulatory network based upon a rather delicate bala nce between helper and suppressor (e.g., the RT6 + T-lymphocytes) cells; whereas the exogenous component is represented by an environmental factor (e.g., mercury) capable of altering the balance within th e immunoregulatory network. The manifestation of autoimmunity requires the presence and interaction of both of these components. In a similar study, Castedo et al. (1993) found that mercuric chloride induced CD4 + autoreactive T-cells proliferate in the presence of class II+ cells in susceptible Brown-Norway rats as well as in resistant Lewis rats. However, while those cells were believed to collaborate w ith B-cells in Brown-Norway rats to produce MERCURY 218 2. HEALTH EFFECTS autoantibodies, in Lewis rats they apparently in itiate a suppressor circuit involving antiergotypic CD8+ suppressor cells. In Brown-Norway rats given 5 subc utaneous 1 mg/kg injections of me rcuric chloride over a 10-day period, tissue injury (including vasculitis) was seen within 24 hour s of the first injection (Qasim et al. 1995). The rapid onset of tissue injury suggests that cells other than T-cells may be involved in the primary induction of vasculitis typically seen as a response to mercuric chlori de in this species. It is possible that this injury occurs through a direct action of HgCl2 on neutrophils or through activati on of mast cells, resulting in the release of TNF and IL8, which promote chemotaxis and activation of neutrophils. However, the changes in the Th2-like (CD4+CD45) T-cell subsets seen in this study were considered to provide support for the hypothesis that a rise in T helper cells drives the observed autoimmune syndrome, providing B-cell help, which leads to polyclonal activation a nd production of a range of antibodies. Jiang and Moller (1995) found that mercuric chloride induced increased DNA synthesis in vitro (peak activity between days 4 and 6) in lymphocytes from sever al mouse strains and suggested a crucial role for helper T-cells in HgCl2-induced immunotoxicity. The results of this study (1) mercuric chloride activated CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells (in vitro) in a manner analogous to a specific antigen-driven response; (2) activation was dependent upon the presen ce of accessory cells; and (3) helper T-cells were induced to divide and transform in responder organ ce lls. This led Jiang and Moller (1995) to hypothesize that mercury binds to molecules on the antigen-pr esenting cell (APC) and transforms molecules on these cells to superantigens capable of activ ating T-cells with a particular set of antigen-binding receptors. In this manner, mercury could induce an internal activation of the immune system, which would in turn result in a variety of symptoms in predisposed individuals. Both mercuric chloride (1 \u00b5M) and methylmercury (2 \u00b5M) have to increase Ca++ concentrations in splenic lymphocytes in a concentr ation-dependent manner (Tang et al. 1993). The time course for the effect was, however, different for the two mercurials. In the case of methylmercury, the increase in intracellular Ca++ was rapid and the increased level was sustained over time, whereas the Ca++ rise caused by HgCl2 was slower. While the effects of those mercurials did not appear to be associated with alterations of membrane integrity, both HgCl2 and methylmercury did appear to cause membrane damage when the incubation time was extended. This study also found that methylmercury and mercuric chloride appear to exert their effects on internal lymphocyte Ca++ levels in different ways. Methylmercury increases intracellular Ca++ by both an apparent increase in the permeability of the membrane to MERCURY 219 2. HEALTH EFFECTS extracellular Ca++ and the mobilization of Ca++ from intracellular stores (perhaps the endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria), whereas HgCl2 of extracellular Ca++. 2.4.3 Animal-to-Human Extrapolations Mechanisms for the end toxic effects of inorganic and organic mercury are believed to be similar, and the differences in parent compound toxicity result from diffe rence in the kinetics and metabolism of the parent compound. Animal models generally reflect the toxi c events observed in humans (i.e., neurological for methylmercury toxicity and the kidneys for inorganic mercury); however, there are species and straindifferences in response to mercury exposure. Prenat al exposures in animals result in neurological damage to the more sensitive developing fetus as is the case in humans. The observed inter- and intraspecies differences in the type and severity of the toxic r esponse to mercury may result from differences in the absorption, distribution, transformation, and end ti ssue concentration of the parent mercury compound. For example, C57BL/6, B10.D2, B10.S inbred mice accu mulated higher concentrations of mercury in the spleen than A.SW, and DBA/2 strains, subjected to the same dosage regimen. The higher concentration of splenic mercury in C57BL/6, B10.D2, B10.S correla ted with the increased suscep tibility of these strains to a mercury chloride-induced systemic autoimmune sy ndrome. The lower splenic mercury in A.SW, and DBA/2 strains resulted in more resistance to an autoimmune response (Griem et al. 1997). A better understanding of certain physiological and bi ochemical processes affecting mercury kinetics may help explain these species differences. Specific processes that appear likely determinants include differences in demethylation rates affecting methyl mercury fecal secretion, reabsorption, and membrane transport (Farris et al. 1993); differences in tissue glutathione content and renal -glutamyltranspeptidase activity (Tanaka et al. 1991, 1992), differences in antioxidative status (Miller and Woods 1993),differences in plasma cysteine concentrations compar ed with other thiol-containing amino acids (Aschner and Clarkson 1988; Clarkson 1995), and differences in factors that could affect gut lumenal uptake (Foulkes and Bergman 1993; Urano et al. 1990). Better controls and reporting of dietary factors, volume and timing of doses, and housing conditions would assist in the comparisons of effects among species and strains. Further development of PBPK/PBPD models will assist in addressing these differences and in extrapolating animal data to support risk assessments for mercury exposure in humans.MERCURY 220 2. HEALTH EFFECTS 2.5 RELEVANCE TO PUBLIC HEALTH OVERVIEW The nature and severity of the toxicity that may result from mercury exposure are functions of the magnitude and duration of exposure, the route of e xposure, and the form of the mercury or mercury compound to which exposure occurs. Since the u ltimate toxic species for all mercury compounds is thought to be the mercuric ion, the kinetics of th e parent compound are the primary determinant of the severity of parent compound toxicity. It is differences in the delivery to target sites that result in the spectrum of effects. Thus, mercury, in both inorgani c and organic forms, can be toxic to humans and other animals. Ingestion of methylmercuric chloride, for example, is more harmful than ingestion of an equal amount of inorganic salts (e.g., mercuric chloride or mercuric acetate), since methylmercury is more readily absorbed through the intestinal tract (about 95%) than are me rcuric salts (about 10-30%). In turn, ingestion of inorganic mercury salts is more harmful than ing estion of an equal amount of liquid metallic mercury, because of negligible absorption of liquid metallic me rcury (about 0.01%) from the gastrointestinal tract. There is insufficient information to develop a comple te matrix of effects for different mercury forms by route of exposure. The information on inhalation exposure to mercury is limited primarily to metallic mercury; only a few case studies are available for exposur e to inorganic dusts or volatile organomercurials. Inorganic salts of mercury do not readily cross the blood-brain barrier or the placenta. They are, therefore, ultimately less toxic to the central nervous system a nd the developing fetus than either absorbed metallic mercury or organic mercury compounds. Metallic mercur y is more readily oxidized to mercuric mercury than is methylmercury, so its transport across the pl acenta and into the brain may be more limited than that of methylmercury. Once in the central nervous syst em, however, metallic mercury vapor is oxidized to the mercuric ion (Hg++), which is then trapped in the central nervous system due to the limited ability of the mercuric ion to cross the blood-brain barrier. Merc urous salts are relatively unstable in the presence of sulfhydryl groups and readily transform to metallic mercury and mercuric mercury. Thus, mercurous forms of mercury will possess the toxic characteristics of both metallic and mercuric mercury. Allmercury compounds may ultimately be oxidized to diva lent (or mercuric) mercury, which preferentially deposits in the kidneys, and all mercury compounds may cause some degree of renal toxicity. While this is not MERCURY 221 2. HEALTH EFFECTS typically the first effect noted in all forms of mercur y exposure, it can be an ultimate effect of either low- dose chronic intake or high-dose acute mercury exposure. The most sensitive end point following oral exposure of any duration to inorganic salts of mercury appears to be the kidneys. Liquid metallic mercury can volatilize at ambient temperatures. The absorption ofmetallic mercury vapors from lungs is high (about 80%) (Hursh et al. 1976), and the most sensitive target following inhalation exposure to metallic mercury is the central nervous system. Absorbed metallic mercury crosses the placenta, and the fetal blood may c oncentrate mercury to levels 10 or more times the levels found in the maternal blood. Therefore, the developing fetal nervous system may be quite sensitive to maternal exposures to mercury vapors. Salts of mercury and organic mercury compounds ar e far less volatile than liquid mercury under most conditions. Inhalation of mercury vapors from these form s is not considered a major source of exposure. While inhalation of particulate matter containing me rcury salts and/or organic compounds is possible, intestinal absorption is a more likely route of exposur e. The most sensitive end point for oral exposure to alkyl mercury compounds (e.g., methylmercuric chlori de or ethylmercurials) is the developing nervous system, but toxicity to the adult nervous system may also result from prolonged low-dose exposures. Mercury may adversely affect a wide range of othe r organ systems, if exposures are sufficiently high. These effects may result from the mercuric ion's affinity for sulfhydryl groups, which are ubiquitous inanimal tissue. Pharmacokinetic studies indicate that repeated or con tinuous exposure to any form of mercury can result in the accumulation of mercury in the body. Numerous studies using laboratory animals have shown that retention of mercury in the brain may persist l ong after cessation of short- and long-term exposures. Mercury is unusual in its ability to induce delayed neurological effects. This is especially prevalent with exposure to alkyl mercury compounds. In such cases, the onset of adverse effects may be delayed for months after the initial exposure. The delayed eff ects of methyl- and dimethylmercury reported in human poisonings are thought, in part, to result from binding to red blood cells, and subsequent slow release. Methylmercury also forms a complex in plasma with th e amino acid cysteine, which is structurally similar to the essential amino acid methionine (Aschner and Clarkson 1988). Clarkson (1995) proposed that methylmercury can cross the blood-brain barrier \"disguised\" as an amino acid via a carrier-mediatedsystem (i.e., transport is not solely the result of methylmercury's lipid solubility). MERCURY 222 2. HEALTH EFFECTS Phenylmercuric acetate is another form of organic mercury to which the general public may be exposed. Although phenylmercury compounds are considered orga nomercurials, they are absorbed less efficiently by the gastrointestinal tract than is methylmercur y. Once inside the body, phenylmercury is rapidly metabolized to Hg++, and its effects are, therefore, similar to those of mercuric salts. Dimethylmercury is an extremely toxic form of organic mercury, and very small exposures can cause se vere and irreversible delayed neurotoxicity, including death. Dimethylmercury is thought to be metabolized to methylmercury prior to crossing the bl ood-brain barrier. Dimethylmercury is used in the calibration of laboratory equipment, as a reagent, and in the manufacture of other chemicals. Unlike otherforms of mercury, dimethylmercury is quickly absorb ed through intact skin, and it will penetrate latex or polyvinyl gloves. It is highly volatile, will readily evaporate, and can be inhaled. Based on its vapor pressure of 58.8 mm at 23.7 EC, Toribara et al. (1997) estimated that a cubic meter of saturated air could hold more than 600 g of dimethylmercury. A recent case history of a chemist who died from an accidentalspill of dimethylmercury is prompting calls for its re moval as an analytical standard as a safety precaution to prevent further accidents. Upon significant inhalation exposure to metallic mercur y vapors, some people (primarily children) may exhibit a syndrome known as acrodynia, or pink disease. Acrodynia is often characterized by severe legcramps; irritability; and erythema and subsequent peeli ng of the hands, nose, and soles of the feet. Itching, swelling, fever, tachycardia, elevated blood pressu re, excessive salivation or perspiration, morbilliform rashes, fretfulness, sleeplessness, and/or weakness may al so be present. It was formerly thought that this syndrome occurred exclusively in children, but recen t reported cases in teenagers and adults have shown that these groups are also susceptible. Occupational mercury exposures generally occur when workers inhale metallic mercury vapors. Some dermal absorption may occur from skin contact with cont aminated air, but the rate is low (less than 3% of the inhaled dose). Dialkyl mercury compounds, whic h are not normally found in hazardous waste sites, are rapidly and extensively absorbed from bot h dermal and inhalation routes of exposure. Mercury is a naturally occurring element in the earth's cr ust. It is considered to have been a component of the lithosphere since the planet was formed approxima tely 4.5 billion years ago. However, levels of mercury at or near the earth's surface (environmental background levels) are increasing as mercurycontinues to be released from the earth's crust by bot h natural (weathering, volcanoes) and human (mining, MERCURY 223 2. HEALTH EFFECTS burning of fossil fuels) activities. Background levels , however, are considerable below harmful levels. There are a number of possible pathways for exposure to mercury. For a hazardous waste site that contains mercury that is being released to the environment, pathways that could result in human exposure to mercury include: (1) eating fish or wild game near the top of the food chain (i.e., larger fish, larger mammals) that have accumulated mercury in their tissues from living at or near the site; (2) playing on orin contaminated surface soils; (3) playing with liquid mercury from broken electrical switches,thermometers, blood pressure monitors etc.; or (4) bringing any liquid mercury or broken mercury device into the home, where vapors might build up in indoor air. Other potentially harmful exposure pathways include the excessive use of skin ointments or creams (e.g., skin lightening creams, antiseptic creams) that contain mercury compounds, the use of mercury fungicides (breathing vapors or contact of the skin withthe fungicide), or the use of liquid mercury in herbal remedies or religious practices, especially if usedindoors. If swallowed, liquid mercury is not very ha rmful, because it is not easily absorbed into the body from the gastrointestinal tract. However, small amount s of liquid mercury evaporate at room temperature, and the inhaled vapors are harmful. The developing fetus and breast-fed infants are vulnerable to the harmful effects of mercury. The fetus can be exposed to mercury from the pregnant woman's body through the placenta, and infants may be exposed from the nursing woman's milk. Both inhaled mercur y vapors and ingested methylmercury can cross the placenta. Inorganic mercury, and to a lesser extent elemental mercury and methylmercury, will move into breast milk. Pregnant women and nursing women need to be extra cautious in their use of consumerproducts containing mercury (such as some religious or herbal remedies or skin lightening creams); they should also pay attention to possible exposures to mercury at work and at home. The primary pathways of mercury exposure for th e general population are from eating fish or marine mammals that contain methylmercury, or from breathi ng in or swallowing very small amounts of mercury that are released from the dental amalgam used for fillings. The relative contribution of mercury from these two main sources will vary considerably for diffe rent individuals, depending upon the amount of fish consumed, the level of mercury in the fish, the numbe r of amalgam fillings, eating and chewing habits, and a number of other factors. Methylmercury levels vary considerably between sp ecies and within species of fish (depending on water conditions and size), so there are wide ranges in estimat es of the average exposure levels to mercury in the general population from consumption of fish. Some r esearchers estimate that the typical daily exposure to MERCURY 224 2. HEALTH EFFECTS mercury is 0.49 \u00b5g/day for infants (aged 6-11 months), 1.3 \u00b5g/d for 2-year-old children, 2.9 \u00b5g/day for females aged 25-30 years, and 3.9 \u00b5g/day for males 25-30 years of age. Expressed on a per body weightbasis, the intake for all age groups, except for 2-y ear-old children, was approximately 0.05 \u00b5g/kg/day (Clarkson 1990; Gunderson 1988). More recently, MacI ntosh et al. (1996) estimated mean dietary exposure of 8.2 \u00b5g/d (range, 0.37-203.5 \u00b5g/day) for females and 8.6 \u00b5g/day (range, 0.22-165.7 \u00b5g/day) for males. For an average body weight of 65 kg for women and 70 kg for men, the daily intakes ofmercury would be 0.126 \u00b5g/kg/da y (range, men and 0.123 \u00b5g/kg/day (range, 3.1-2,367 ng/kg/day) for men, respectively. Lack of data about the actual amount of food consumed accounted for 95% of the total uncertainty for mercury. This was especially true for consumption levels of canned tuna and other fish (MacIntosh et al. 1996) The Food and Drug Administration (FDA, 1996) has posted on the Internet advice for consumers recommending that pregnant women and women of ch ildbearing age, who may become pregnant, limit their consumption of shark and swordfish to no more that one meal per month. This advice is given because methylmercury levels are relatively high in these fish species. The FDA's advice covers both pregnant women and women of child-bearing age w ho might become pregnant, since dietary practices immediately before the pregnancy could have a direct bearing on fetal exposure, particularly during the first trimester of pregnancy. The FDA also states that nursing women who follow this advice will notexpose their infants to increased h ealth risks from methylmercury (FDA 1996). For the general population (other than pregnant women and women of ch ild-bearing age), the FDA advises limiting the regular consumption of shark and swordfis h (which typically contain methylmercury at 1 ppm) to about 7 ounces per week (about one serving). This level of consumption results in methylmercury exposures below the U.S. FDA acceptable daily intake level for mercury. For fish species with methylmercury levels averaging 0.5 ppm, regular consumption should be limited to 14 ounces per week. Recreational and subsistence fishers who eat larger amounts of fish than the gene ral population and routinely fish the same waters may have a higher exposure to methylmercury if these waters are contaminated (EPA 1995). People who consume greater than 100 grams of fish per day are c onsidered high-end consumers. This is over 10 times the amount of fish consumed by members of th e general population (6.5 g/day) (EPA 1995). No consumption advice is necessary for the top 10 seafood species, which make up about 80% of the seafood market: canned tuna, shrimp, pollock, salmon, cod, catfish, clams, flatfish, crabs, and scallops. Themethylmercury in these species are generally less th an 0.2 ppm, and few people eat more than the suggested weekly limit of fish (i.e., 2.2 pounds). Mo re information on exposure to methylmercury and the levels in fish can be found in Section 5.5, General Population a nd Occupational Exposures.MERCURY 225 2. HEALTH EFFECTS Estimating mercury exposure from dental amalgams is also difficult because of high variability in the number of amalgam fillings per individual and the di fferences in chewing, eating, and breathing habits. Dental amalgams, however, would be the most significant source of mercury exposure in the absence offish consumption or proximity to a waste site or incinerator. A report from the Committee to Coordinate Environmental Health and Related Programs (CCEHRP) of the Department of Health and Human Services determined a level of from 1 to 5 \u00b5g Hg/day fro m dental amalgam for people with 7-10 fillings (DHHS 1993). The World Health Organization reported a c onsensus average estimate of 10 \u00b5g amalgam Hg/day (range: 3-17 \u00b5g/day) (WHO 1991). Weiner (1995) estimated the average uptake of mercuryfrom amalgam fillings in Swedish subjects to be within the range of 4-19 \u00b5g/day. Skare and Engqvist (1994) estimated that the systemic uptake of mercury from amalgams in middle-aged Swedish individualswith a moderate amalgam load (30 surfaces) was, on the average, 12 \u00b5g/day, an amount said to be equivalent to a daily occupational air mercury exposure concentration of 2 \u00b5g/m 3. Other researchers have estimated the average daily absorption of Hg fro m amalgam at 1-27 \u00b5g/day, with levels for some individuals being as high as 100 \u00b5g/day (Bj\u00f6rkman et al. 1997; Lorscheider et al. 1995). Richardson et al. (1995) estimated total mercury expos ure for Canadian populations of different ages to be 3.3 \u00b5g/day in toddlers (3-4 years old), 5.6 \u00b5g/day in children (5-11 years old), 6.7 \u00b5g/day in teens(12-19 years old), 9.4 \u00b5g/day in adults (20-59 years old) , and 6.8 \u00b5g/day in seniors (aged 60+). Of this exposure, amalgam was estimated to contribute 50% to the total Hg in adults and 32-42% for other age groups. Estimates based on 2 independent models of exposure from amalgam alone were 0.8-1.4 \u00b5g/day in adults, and2.1-2.8 \u00b5g/day in seniors (Richardson 1995). Higher levels of mercury exposure can occur in indivi duals who chew gum or show bruxism, a rhythmic or spasmodic grinding of the teeth other than chewing and typically occurring during sleep (Barregard et al.1995; Enestrom and Hultman 1995). Richardson (1995) re ported a transient 5.3-fold increase in levels of mercury upon stimulation by chewing, eating, or tooth brushing. Sallsten et al. (1996) also reported over a 5-fold increase in plasma and urinary mercury levels (27 and 6.5 nmol/mmol creatinine versus 4.9 and 1.2 nmol/mmol creatinine, respectively) in a sample of 18 people who regularly chewed nicotine chewing gum (median values of 10 sticks per day fo r 27 months), compared to a control group. Berdouses et al. (1995) studied mercury release from dental amalgams using an artificial mouth under controlled conditions of brushing a nd chewing and found that although the release of mercury during initialMERCURY 226 2. HEALTH EFFECTS nonsteady-state conditions was influenced by both th e age of the amalgam and the amalgam type, the steady-state value of the mercury dose rel eased by the amalgam was only 0.03 \u00b5g/day. Sandborgh-Englund et al. (1998) evaluated the absorption, blood levels, and excretion of mercury in nine healthy volunteers (2 males, 7 females) exposed to 400 \u00b5g /m3 mercury vapor in air for 15 minutes. This exposure corresponded to a dose of 5.5 nmol Hg/kg body weight. Samples of exhaled air, blood and urine were collected for 30 days after exposure. The median retention of elemental Hg was 69% of the inhaled dose. To evaluate the chronic exposure to mercur y from dental amalgam in the general population, the daily Hg dose from fillings was estimated based on the plasma Hg levels of subjects with amalgam fillings and the plasma clearance obtained in this study. The da ily dose was estimated to be from 5 to 9 \u00b5g/day in subjects with an \"average\" number amalgam fillings (Sandborgh-Englund etal. 1998) Halbach (1994) examined the data from 14 independent studies and concluded that the probable mercury dose from amalgam is less than 10 \u00b5g/day. When combined with the 2.6 \u00b5g/day background intake estimated by WHO (1990) for persons without amalga m fillings and with an estimated methylmercury intake of 5 \u00b5g/day from food, Halbach noted that th e sum of all those inputs still falls within the WHO's 40 \u00b5g/day acceptable daily intake (ADI) level for to tal mercury. For the ADI of 40 \u00b5g total mercury exposure inhaled, approximately 30 \u00b5g would be absorbed, assuming 80% absorption (Halbach 1994; WHO 1976). Whether adverse health effects result from exposure to mercury from amalgams at the levels reported above is currently a topic of on-going research and considerab le discussion. A thorough review of this subject is beyond the scope of this profile. Readers are referred to the end of this section (see More on the Effects of Dental Amalgam) for a discussion of some recent reviews of this topic, and a few examples of studies onthe putative toxic effects or the lack thereof from continued use of amalgam. Other Uses of Metallic Mercury A less well-documented source of exposure to metallic mercury among the general population is its use in ethnic religious, magical, and ritualistic practices, and in herbal remedies. Mercury has long been used for medicinal purposes in Chinese herbal preparations and is also used in some Hispanic practices for medical and/or religious reasons. Espinoza et al. (1996) an alyzed 12 types of commercially produced herbal ball preparations used in traditional Chinese medicine. Mercury levels were f ound to range from 7.8 to MERCURY 227 2. HEALTH EFFECTS 621.3 mg per ball. Since the minimum recommended adult dosage is 2 such balls daily, intake levels of up to 1.2 mg of mercury (presumed to be mercury sulfide) might be a daily dosage. Some religions have practices that may include the use of metallic mercury. Examples of these religions include Santeria (a Cuban-based religion that wors hips both African deities and Catholic saints), Voodoo (a Haitian-based set of beliefs and rituals), Palo Mayomb e (a secret form of ancestor worship practiced mainly in the Caribbean), and Espiritismo (a spiritual belief system native to Puerto Rico). Not all people who observe these religions use mercury, but when mercury is used in religious, folk, or ritualistic practices, exposure to mercury may occur both at the time of the practice and afterwards from breathing incontaminated indoor air. Metallic mercury is so ld under the name \"azogue\" (pronounced ah-SEW-gay) in stores called \"botanicas.\" Botanicas are common in Hispanic and Haitian communities, where azogue may be sold as an herbal remedy or for spiritual practices. The metallic mercury is often sold in capsules or in glass containers. It may be placed in a sealed pouch to be worn on a necklace or carried in a pocket, or it may be sprinkled in the home or car. Some store ow ners may also suggest mixing azogue in bath water or perfume, and some people place azogue in devotional ca ndles. The use of metallic mercury in a home or apartment not only threatens the health of the current residents, but also poses health risks to future residents, who may unknowingly be exposed to furthe r release of mercury vapors from contaminated floors, carpeting, or walls. Due to the increased number of reported metallic merc ury poisonings and to the widespread potential for exposure to liquid/metallic mercury in school chem istry and science laboratories and other places accessible to the general public, the EPA and ATSDR issued a jo int mercury alert in June 1997, alerting school and public health officials to the potential toxicity of th is substance. This joint mercury alert also advised restricting access to mercury-containing spaces and storag e rooms, and the use of alternative substances or chemicals for purposes for which liquid/metallic mercury is currently used. Issues relevant to children are explicitly discussed in Sections 2.6, Children's Susceptibility, and 5.6, Exposures of Children. Minimal Risk Levels for Mercury A common misconception is that health guidance valu es, such as the MRL, represent a level above which toxicity is likely to occur. This misconception has occasionally led to unwarranted concern and public MERCURY 228 2. HEALTH EFFECTS apprehension about relatively benign exposures to e nvironmental substances. The MRL is neither a threshold for toxicity, nor a level beyond which toxicity is likely to occur. MRLs are established solely as screening tools for public health officials to use when determining whether further evaluation of potential exposure at a hazardous waste site is warranted. Th e relevance of the MRL to public health is discussed further in the following sections concerning th e derivation of the respective mercury MRLs. ATSDR has established a chronic inhalation MRL of 0.2 \u00b5g/m3 for metallic mercury. Assuming a ventilation rate of 20 m3/day for an average adult, and assuming co mplete absorption, exposure at the level of the MRL would result in a daily dose of 4 \u00b5g. Th is level of exposure is thought to represent no health risk to any element of the human population. No ot her inhalation MRLs have b een derived for mercury or its compounds. Oral MRLs have been established for acute (0.007 mg/ kg/day) and intermediate (0.002 mg/kg/day) duration exposures to inorganic mercury. ATSDR has also established a chronic oral MRL of 0.0003 mg/kg/day (equivalent to 21 \u00b5g/day for a 70-kg adult) for methylmercury. This MRL is at least four times theestimated average daily intake level for methylmerc ury from the diet. The FDA has estimated that, on average, the intake rate for total mercury (both inorganic and organic) is 50-100 ng/kg/day (equivalent to 0.05-0.1 \u00b5g/kg/day or 3.5-7 \u00b5g/day for a 70-kg adult). This figure is based on the FDA total diet study of1982-1984 (Gunderson 1988). Approximately 80-90% of th e mercury in the FDA estimate would be expected to be in the form of methylmercury. A sep arate estimate of the average intake of methylmercury alone, based on a survey of fish eaters and on average levels of methylmercury in fish, places the average intake of methylmercury at 36 ng/kg/ day (equivalent to 0.036 \u00b5g/kg/day or \u00b5g/day for a 70-kg at 243 ng/kg/day (equivale nt to or 17 \u00b5g/day for a 70-kg adult) (Clarkson 1990). These results indicate that an assessment of total methylmercury intake and body burden should be conducted when es timating exposure to mercury in populations (especially sensitive populations) living near hazardous waste sites that have the potential to release mercury to theenvironment. Inhalation MRLs No inhalation MRLs were derived for inorganic merc ury salts or organic mercury compounds due to the absence of data or to the lack of sufficient inform ation regarding exposure levels associated with the reported observed effects.MERCURY 229 2. HEALTH EFFECTS No MRLs were derived for acute- or intermediate-dur ation inhalation exposure to metallic mercury vapors. Available studies were either deficient in their reporti ng of details of experimental protocols and results, used an insufficient number of experimental anim als, or tested only one dose/concentration level. CAn MRL of 0.0002 mg/m3 has been derived for chronic-dur ation inhalation exposure (365 days or longer) to metallic mercury vapor. A significant increase in the average velocity of natu rally occurring tremors compared to controls was observed in a group of 26 mercury-exposed workers (from 3 industries) exposed to low levels of mercury for an average of 15.3 years (range, 1-41 years) (Fawer et al. 1983). To estimate an equivalent continuous exposure concentration, the average concentrati on assumed for the 8 hour/day exposures was multiplied by 8/24 factors of 10 for variability in sensitivity to mercury within the human population and 3 for use of a minimal-effect LOAELin MRL derivation were then a pplied to the calculated 0.0062 mg/m 3 value, yielding a chronic inhalation MRL of 0.2 \u00b5g/m3. Although this MRL is based on experiment al data from an adult working population, there is no experimental or clinical evidence to sugg est that it would not also be sufficiently protective of neurodevelopmental effects in developing embryos/fe tuses and children, the most sensitive subgroups for metallic mercury toxicity. Inhaled metallic mercury is quickly absorbed through th e lungs into the blood, and 70-80% is retained. Its biological half-life in humans is approximately 60 days. The half-life is different for different physiological compartments (e.g., 21 days in the head versus 64 da ys in the kidneys) (Hursh et al. 1976). Since the duration of exposure influences the level of mercury in the body, the exposure level reported in the Fawer et al. (1983) occupational study was extrapolated from an 8-hour day, 40-hour workweek exposure to a level equivalent to a continuous 24 hour/day, 7 day/week exposure, as might be encountered near a hazardous waste site containing metallic mercury. Gentry et al. (1998) used the neurobehavioral in formation on a control group and one exposure group from the Fawer et al. (1983) study to derive an inhala tion MRL for elemental mercury based upon a benchmark dose (BMD) analysis. Dose-response analysis could be performed on four measures of hand tremor, with tasks performed both at rest and with a load. The e xposure level of the exposed group to metallic mercury was assumed to be the mean TWA exposure of 0.026 mg/m3. A physiologically based pharmacokinetic model for metallic mercury vapor was found to be lin ear through the region of concern from the LOAEL to MERCURY 230 2. HEALTH EFFECTS the MRL; that is, the relationship between inhaled c oncentration and target tissue concentration at the LOAEL and at lower levels (including the MRL) did not differ. Therefore, exposure concentrations were used directly for the analysis. Gentry et al. (1998) also assumed that 1% of the unexposed population would be considered in the adverse response range. The BMD10 was the dose at which the probability of exceeding the 1% adverse response level was 10% gr eater than in unexposed individuals, and the BMDL10 is the 95% lower bound confidence level on that dose. A simple linear model sufficed to describe the dose- response. A BMDL10 of 0.017 mg metallic mercury/m3 was derived as a reasonable representation of the sparse data. This level would be equivalent to a NOAEL (i.e., no LOAEL to NOAEL uncertainty factor is needed). Using a PBPK model to estimate target ti ssue doses from inhaled mercury vapor and adjusting for continuous exposure and interhuman variability (with an uncertainty factor of 10), an MRL of 0.0004 mg/m3 (based on target tissue dose) was derived wh ich is about two times the ATSDR derived MRL of 0.0002 mg/m3 based upon the Fawer et al. (1983) LOAEL. The ability of long-term, low-level exposure to meta llic mercury to produce a degradation in neurological performance was also demonstrated in other studies. One such study (Ngim et al. 1992) attributed adverse neurological effects to a lower average level of expos ure than did the Fawer et al. (1983) study; however, this study was not used in deriving a chronic i nhalation MRL due to uncertainties concerning the study protocol, including methodological and reporting deficienci es. In the Ngim et al. (1992) study, dentists with an average of 5.5 years of exposure to low leve ls of metallic mercury were reported to have impaired performance on several neurobehavioral tests. Exposur e levels measured at the time of the study ranged from 0.0007 to 0.042 mg/m3, with an average of 0.014 mg/m3. Mean blood mercury levels among the dentists ranged from 0.6 to 57 \u00b5g/L, with a geometric mean of 9.8 \u00b5g/L. The performance of the dentists on finger tapping (measures digital motor speed), tra il-making (measures visual scanning and motor speed), digit symbol (measures visuomotor coordination and c oncentration), digit span, logical memory delayed recall (measure of verbal memory), and Bender-Gestalt time (measures visual construction) tests wassignificantly poorer than controls. The exposed dentis ts also showed higher aggression than did controls. Furthermore, within the group of exposed dentis ts, significant differences were observed between a subgroup with high mercury exposure compared to a subgroup with lower exposure. These exposure severity subgroups were not compared to controls, a nd average exposure levels for the subgroups were not reported. The design and reporting of this study limits its usefulness in deriving an MRL for metallic mercury. The exposure status of the subjects was know n to the investigator during testing, mercury levels were not reported for controls, and methods used to adjust for potential contributions other than mercury from amalgams to the study results (such as the po ssible use in this population of traditional medicines MERCURY 231 2. HEALTH EFFECTS containing mercury) were not reported. It was also unclear whether the results for the mercury exposure group were inordinately influenced or skewed by th e individual dentists with the highest exposures and/or blood levels. These confounding factors precluded the use of the Ngim et al. (1992) study for the derivation of an MRL, but the study does provide support both for the premise that low-dose chronic exposure tometallic mercury can result in adverse health sequelae and for the chronic inhalation MRL that is based on the Fawer et al. (1983) study of occupationally exposed individuals. Other occupational studies further support the ability of metallic mercury to induce neurological deficits. Several studies have reported significant effects on tremor or cognitive skills among groups exposed occupationally to comparable or slightly higher (up to 0.076 mg/m 3) levels (Ehrenberg et al. 1991; Piikivi et al. 1984; Roels et al. 1982). Difficulty with heel-to- toe gait was observed in thermometer plant workers subjected to mean personal breathing z one air concentrations of 0.076 mg/m3 (range, 0.026-0.27 mg/m3) (Ehrenberg et al. 1991). Tremors have also been re ported in occupationally exposed workers with urinary mercury concentrations of 50-100 \u00b5g/g creatinine and blood levels of 10-20 \u00b5g/L (Roels et al. 1982). By comparison, blood mercury levels in the Fawer et al . (1983) study averaged 41.3 and 16.6 \u00b5mol Hg/L for the exposed and control groups, respectively. Urinary mercury levels for the exposed workers in the Fawer et al. (1983) study averaged 11.3 \u00b5mol 20 in the controls. Piikivi et al. (1984) found decreases in performance on tests that measured intelligence (based upon a similarities test) and memory (evaluating digit span and visual reproduction) in chloralkali workers exposed for an average of 16.9 years (range, 10-37 years) to low levels of mercury, when compared to an age-matched cont rol group. In this study, significant differences from controls were observed on these tests among 16 work ers with blood levels ranging from 75 nmol/L to 344 nmol/L and urine levels ranging from 280 nmol/L (about 56 \u00b5g/L) to 663 nmol/L. Abnormal nerve conduction velocities have also been observed in chlora lkali plant workers at a mean urine concentration of 450 \u00b5g/L (Levine et al. 1982). These workers also expe rienced weakness, paresthesias, and muscle cramps. Prolongation of brainstem auditory evoked potentials was observed in wo rkers with urinary mercury levels of 325 \u00b5g/g creatinine (Discalzi et al. 1993). Pr olonged somatosensory-evoked potentials were found in 28 subjects exposed to airborne me rcury concentrations of 20-96 mg/m 3 (Langauer-Lewowicka and Kazibutowska 1989). All of these studies substantiate the ability of chronic, low- to moderate-level exposure to metallic mercury vapors to cause neurological deficiencies.MERCURY 232 2. HEALTH EFFECTS Employment of the Chronic Inhalation MRL for Metallic Mercury ATSDR emphasizes that the MRL is not intended to be used as an estimation of a threshold level. Exceeding the MRL does not necessarily mean that a health threat exists. However, the greater the amount by which the MRL is exceeded and the longer or more frequent the individual exposures, the greater the likelihood that some adverse health outcome may occu r. Secondly, the chronic inhalation MRL is, by definition, a level that is considered to be without appreciable (or significant) health risk over a lifetime of exposure at that level. It is further considered to be a \"safe\" level for all factions of the exposed human population, when exposure exists for 24 hours a day, 7 da ys a week for an extended period of years. The employment of the MRL, therefore, must be geared to the particular exposure scenario at hand. Forexample, people may be able to \"tolerate\" metallic mercury levels above the MRL for intermittent periods of exposure (e.g., 1 or 2 hours per day, 5 days per w eek) without any adverse health sequelae, either overt or covert. The use of the \"contaminated area\" (e.g ., storage versus exercise room versus day care) will largely influence the use of the MRL. Finally, the MRL is intended primarily as a \"screening value\" for public health officials to use in their assessment of whether further evaluation of the potential risk to public health is warranted in a hazardous waste site scenario. The MRL is not intended, nor should it be indiscriminately used, as a clean-up or remediation level, or as a predictor of adverse health effects. While it is considered to afford an adequate degree of protection for the health of all potentially exposed individuals, it might be unnecessarily stringent for appli cation to some exposure situations (i.e., higher air concentrations might afford a similar degree of prot ection in some exposure scenarios); thus, its relevance in any specific environmental situation is intended to be determined by an experienced public health or medical official. Oral MRLs Metallic Mercury No oral MRLs were derived for metallic (elemental) mercury due to the lack of data. Oral exposure to liquid metallic mercury would be expected to presen t little health risk, since it is so poorly absorbed (<0.01%) through the healthy intestine. Sufficiently large quantities could, however, present a risk of intestinal blockage, and some could enter the sy stemic circulation (blood or lymphatic) through open lesions, presenting a risk of occlusion of smaller ar teries, especially within the pulmonary circulation.MERCURY 233 2. HEALTH EFFECTS Inorganic Mercury The acute- and intermediate-duration MRLs for oral exposure to inorganic mercury are based on kidney effects reported in a 1993 NTP study of mercuric ch loride (NTP 1993). Most of the supporting studies of oral exposure to inorganic mercury also use mercuric chloride. Mercuric sulfide (also known as cinnabar) is the predom inant natural form of mercury in the environment and is a common ore from which metallic mercury is de rived. Mercury released to the environment may be transformed into mercuric sulfide. Several studies s uggest that the bioavailability of mercuric sulfide in animals is less than that of mercuric chloride (Sin et al. 1983, 1990; Yeoh et al. 1986, 1989). For example,Sin et al. (1983) found an increase in tissue levels of mercury in mice orally exposed to low doses ofmercuric chloride, but elevated levels of mercury were not found in the tissues of mice fed an equivalent weight of mercuric sulfide. This finding i ndicates a difference in bioavailability between HgCl 2 and HgS in mice. However, a quantitative determination of the relative bioavailabilities of mercuric sulfide versus mercuric chloride has not been derived in the av ailable studies, nor has the relative bioavailability of mercuric sulfide in humans been examined. C An MRL of 0.007 mg Hg/kg/day has been derive d for acute-duration oral exposure (14 days or less) to inorganic mercury. The MRL was based on a NOAEL of 0.93 mg Hg/kg/day for renal effects in rats administered mercuric chloride 5 days a week for 2 weeks. The dose used in this study was duration-adjusted for a 5-day/week exposure and divided by an uncertainty factor of 100 (10 for extrapolation from animals to humans and 10 for human variability). Increased absolute and re lative kidney weights were observed in male rats exposed to 1.9 mg Hg/kg/day as mercuric chloride (NTP 1993). At higher doses, an increased incidence and severity of tubular necrosis was observed. Several other studies examining the effects of oral e xposure to inorganic mercury salts have also shown renal toxicity in humans as a result of acute oral exposures. Kidney effects (i.e., heavy albuminuria, hypoalbuminemia, edema, and hypercholesterolemia) have been reported after therapeutic administration of inorganic mercury (Kazantzis et al. 1962). Acute re nal failure has been observed in a number of case studies in which mercuric chloride had been ing ested (Afonso and deAlvarez 1960; Murphy et al. 1979; Samuels et al. 1982). The autopsy of a 35-year-old man who ingested a lethal dose of mercuric chloride MERCURY 234 2. HEALTH EFFECTS and exhibited acute renal failure showed pale and swollen kidneys (Murphy et al. 1979). A case study reported acute renal failure characterized by oliguria, proteinuria, hematuria, and granular casts in a woman who ingested 30 mg Hg/kg body weight as mercuric chloride (Afonso and deAlvarez 1960). Another case study reported a dramatic increase in urinary protein secretion by a patient who ingested a single dose of15.8 mg Hg/kg body weight as mercuric chloride (assuming a body weight of 70 kg) (Pesce et al. 1977). The authors of the report surmised that the increased excretion of both albumin and 2-microglobulin were indicative of mercury-induced tubular and glomerular pathology. Acute renal failure that persisted for 10 days was also observed in a 19-month-old ch ild who ingested an unknown amount of powdered mercuric chloride (Samuels et al. 1982). Decreased ur ine was also observed in a 22-year-old who attempted suicide by ingesting approximately 20 mg Hg/kg (Chugh et al. 1978). CAn MRL of 0.002 mg Hg/kg/day has been deri ved for intermediate-duration oral exposure (15-364 days) to inorganic mercury. This MRL was based on a NOAEL of 0.23 mg Hg/kg/day for renal effects in rats administered mercuric chloride 5 days a week for 6 months (Dieter et al . 1992; NTP 1993). This dose was duration-adjusted for a 5 day/week exposure and divided by an uncertainty factor of 100 (10 for extrapolation from animals to humans and 10 for human variability). Increased absolute and relative kidney weights were observed in rats exposed to 0.46 mg Hg/kg/day, the next higher treatme nt level. At higher doses, an increased incidence of nephropathy (described as foci of tubular regenera tion, thickened tubular basement membrane, and scattered dilated tubules containing hyaline casts) was obser ved. Renal toxicity is a sensitive end point for inorganic mercury toxicity, as seen in other intermed iate-duration oral studies on rats and mice exposed to inorganic mercury (Carmignani et al. 1992; J onker et al. 1993a; NTP 1993), as well as case reports of humans ingesting inorganic mercury for acute and ch 1992; Nielsen et al. 1991; Pesce et al. 1977). The relatively small difference between the acute-dur ation mg/kg/day) is not meant, nor is it considered, to imply a high level of precision in the calculation of these health guidance values. Rather, this difference of 5 \u00b5g/kg/day reflects the increased toxicity of continued low-dose exposure for longer peri ods of time and is consis tent with the known build- up of mercury levels in body tissues over a prolonged course of continued exposure. The actual precision of any derived (actually estimated) MRL is dependent upon an encompassing, but not sharply defined, area of uncertainty based upon the database used in its determination.MERCURY 235 2. HEALTH EFFECTS As a method of comparison to evaluate whether use of another method to derive an MRL might result in a different intermediate oral MRL value for inorganic mercury, ATSDR used the same data (Dieter et al. 1992; NTP 1993) to calculate a benchmark dose for inor ganic mercury. Using the most sensitive end point identified in this study (relative kidney weight changes in rats), the experimental data were used to obtain a modeled dose-response curve. Benchmark doses were then determined for the 10% response level (0.38 mg/kg/day) and the 5% response level (0.20 mg /kg/day). After adjusting the 5-days/week exposures in the study to 7-days/week equivalent doses, th e 10 and 5% response-base benchmarks became 0.27 and 0.15 mg/kg/day, respectively. Application of 10-fo ld uncertainty factors for each inter- and intraspecies variability resulted in estimated human benchmark doses of 0.003 mg/kg/day for the 10% response level and 0.002 mg/kg/day for the 5% response level. These values strongly support the current existing intermediate oral MRL of 0.002 mg/kg/day for inorganic mercury. No MRL for chronic-duration oral exposure to inor ganic mercury was derived, because the study results showed decreased survival rate for male rats at all LOAELs. Organic Mercury Acute, Intermediate, or Chronic Inhalation MRLs : No inhalation MRLs were derived for organic mercury compounds, due to the absence of data or to the lack of sufficient information regarding exposure levels associated with the reported observed effects. Acute and Intermediate Oral MRLs : No MRLs were derived for acute or intermediate oral exposure to organic mercury compounds due to the absence of data or to the lack of sufficient information regarding exposure levels associated with the reported observed effects. Chronic Oral MRL for Methylmercury: Hair levels are typically used as an index of exposure to methymercury. A number of studies report that hair merc ury levels correlate with total intake levels and with organ-specific levels of mercury. Suzuki et al. (1993) analyzed 46 human autopsies in Tokyo, Japan and reported that hair mercury leve ls were highly significantly correlate d with organ Hg levels in the cerebrum, cerebellum, heart, spleen, liver, kidney co rtex, and kidney medulla, when the total mercury or methyl mercury value in the organ was compared with the hair total mercury or organic mercury, respectively.MERCURY 236 2. HEALTH EFFECTS Nakagawa (1995) analyzed total mercury in hair samples from 365 volunteers in Tokyo, and reported higher mercury levels in those who preferred fish in their diet, compared to those who preferred other foods (preference choices were fish, fish and meat, meat, a nd vegetables). The mean hair mercury levels were 4 ppm in men who preferred fish and 2.7 ppm in women who preferred fish. The lowest hair mercury levels were seen in men and women who pr eferred vegetables, 2.27 and 1.31 ppm, respectively. The mean hair level for the whole group was 2.23 ppm (median 1.98). Drasch et al. (1997) assayed tissue samples of 150 human cadavers (75 males, and 75 females) from a \"normal\" European (German) population, i.e., there were no occupational or higher than average exposures to metals found in any of the biographies of the d eceased. The objective was to evaluate the validity of blood, urine, hair, and muscle as biomarkers for intern al burdens of mercury, lead, and cadmium in the general population. All individuals died suddenly and not as a result of chronic ailments. Age ranged from 16 to 93 years, and every decade was represented by approximately 10 males and 10 females. Tissuessampled included kidney cortex, liver, cerebral cortex , bone (spina iliaca anterior-superior), gluteus), blood (heart blood), urine, and hair (scalp-hair). Statistically significant rank correlations between biomarker levels and tissues were observed, but with large confidence intervals for the regressions. The authors conclude that specific biomarkers relative to each metal are useful in estimating body burdens and trends in groups, but are not useful for determini ng the body burden (and therefore the health risks) in individuals. A notable exception was for correlation to brain mercury. By comparison to a generally poor correlation of cadmium, lead, and mercury between ha ir and tissue, there was a strong correlation between mercury in hair and mercury in brain (cerebrum and cer ebellum). The authors state that this may be due to the high lipophilicity of elemental and short-chain alkyl mercury compounds. As seen in other studies comparing European to Japanese hair mercury levels, the mercury hair levels reported by Nakagawa (1995) of 2-4 ppm for a Japanese population are 10-20 times higher than total mercury levels observed in the Drasch et al. (1997) study (median, 0.247 \u00b5g/g in hair; range, 0.43-2.5 \u00b5g/g). Other studies have confirmed a good correlation between ha ir mercury and brain mercury levels. In a study on the Seychelles Islands cohort, Cernichiari et al. ( 1995b) compared maternal hair levels, maternal blood levels, fetal blood levels, a nd fetal brain levels. Autopsy brains were obtained from infants dying from a variety of causes. The concentrations of total merc ury in six major regions of the brain were highly correlated with maternal hair levels. This correla tion was confirmed by a sequence of comparisons among the four measurements. Maternal hair levels correla ted to maternal blood levels (r=0.82) and infant brainMERCURY 237 2. HEALTH EFFECTS levels (r=0.6-0.8). Concentrations in maternal blood correlated with infant blood levels (r=0.65); and infant blood levels correlated to infa nt brain levels (r=0.4-0.8). Accordingly, ATSDR used maternal hair mercury leve ls as the exposure measurement to derive a chronic MRL for methylmercury. While hair analysis can be confounded by outside sources of contamination (e.g., as might occur in certain occupational settings) (Hac and Krechniak 1993), the study population used as the basis of the chronic oral MRL for methylmercury is far removed from external or industrial sources of mercury, effectively eliminating this as a consideration for the following analysis. CAn MRL of 0.0003 mg Hg/kg/day has been derive d for chronic-duration oral exposure (365 days or longer) to methylmercury. The chronic oral MRL for methylmercury is based upon the Seychelles Child Development Study (SCDS), in which over 700 mother-infant pairs have, to date , been followed and tested from parturition through 66 months of age (Davidson et al. 1998). The SCDS was conducted as a double-blind study and used maternal hair mercury as the index of fetal exposure. Enrollees were recruited by the head nurse/hospital midwife by asking the mothers if they wished to partic ipate in the study when they arrived at the hospital for delivery. The first 779 who did not decline particip ation became the mothers in the study cohort. Of the initial 779 mothers enrolled in the study at parturition, 740 remained at the pre-determined child testing age of 6.5 months, 738 remained in the 19-month cohort, 736 remained at 29 months, and 711 remained for the 66-month neurobehavioral and developmental examinations. The Seychellois were chosen as a study population for a number of reasons. C(1) All fish contain some level of methylme rcury (Davidson et al. 1998); and the Seychellois regularly consume a high quantity and variety of o cean fish, with 12 fish meals per week representing a typical methylmercury exposure. C(2) The median total mercury concentration in 350 fish sampled from 25 species consumed by the Seychellois was <1 ppm (range, 0.004-0.75 ppm), co mparable to the mercury concentration in commercially obtainable fish in the U.S. (It should be noted here that while the methylmercury levels in the Seychellois population are 10-20 times those in the U.S., it is not because they consume more highly contaminated fish, but rather because they consume more fish than the U.S. population.) C(3) The Seychelles represents a relatively pristine environment, with no local industry for pollution, and are situated more than 1,000 miles from any continent or large population center. MERCURY 238 2. HEALTH EFFECTS (4) The population is highly literate, cooperative, and has minimal immigration and emigration. C(5) The Seychellois constitute a generally healthy population, with low maternal alcohol consumption and tobacco use (<2%). C(6) The large sample size/study population (>700 mother-infant pairs). C(7) Excellent retention of mother-infant pairs th roughout the study (i.e., 711 of the initially enrolled 778 mother-infant pairs still particip ating at 66 months post-partum. C(8) The use of standardized neurobehavioral tests. The results of the 66-month testing in the SCDS rev ealed no evidence of adverse effects attributable to chronic ingestion of low levels of methylmercury in fish (Davidson et al. 1998). In this study, developing fetuses were exposed in utero through maternal fish ingestion before and during pregnancy (Davidson et al. 1998). Neonates continued to be exposed to maternal mercury during breastfeeding (i.e., some mercury is secreted in breast milk), and methylmercury expos ure from the solid diet began after the gradual post-weaning shift to a fish diet. In the 66-month st udy cohort, the mean maternal hair level of total mercury during pregnancy was 6.8 ppm (range, 0.5-26.7 ppm; n=711), and the mean child hair level at the 66-month testing interval was 6.5 ppm (range, 0.9-25. 8 ppm; n=708). The mean maternal hair mercury level in the highest exposed subgroup in the study was 15.3 ppm (range, 12-26.7; n=95). The 66-month test battery, which was designed to test multiple developmental domains, included the following primary measurements: C(1) General Cognitive Index (GCI) of the McCarthy Scales of Children's Abilities (to estimate cognitive ability); C(2) the Preschool Language Scale (PLS) total sco re (to measure both expressive and receptive language ability); C(3) the Letter and Word Recognition and C(4) Applied Problems subtests of the Woodcock-Johnson (W-J) Tests of Achievement (to measure reading and arithmetic achievement); C(5) the Bender-Gestalt test (to measure visual-spatial ability); and C (6) the total T score from the Child Behavior Ch ecklist (CBCL) (to measure the child's social and adaptive behavior). Serum sampling revealed no detectable levels of PCBs (detection limit=0.2 ng/mL). MERCURY 239 2. HEALTH EFFECTS None of the tests indicated an adverse effect of methylmercury exposure. As evaluated through regression analyses, there was no reduction in performance with increasing maternal hair mercury levels for the neurobehavioral parameters examined. In contrast, scor es were better for four of the six tests in the highest MeHg-exposed groups, compared with lower exposure gr oups for both prenatal and postnatal exposure (the four test were the (1) General Cognitive Index (GC I) of the McCarthy Scales of Children's `Abilities (to estimate cognitive ability); (2) the Preschool Language Scale (PLS) total score (to measure both expressive and receptive language ability); (3) the Letter and Wo rd Recognition and (4) Applied Problems subtests of the Woodcock-Johnson (W-J) Tests of Achievement (t o measure reading and arithmetic achievement). While the positive outcomes are not considered to indicate any beneficial effect of methylmercury onneurological development or behavior, they might be more appropriately attributed to the beneficial effects of omega-3 fatty acids or other constituents present in fi sh tissue, since the methylmercury levels in hair are known to correlate closely with fish intake. The s light decreases in the subjectively reported activity level of boys reported in the 29-month observations were not seen during the 66-month tests. The mean maternal hair level of 15.3 ppm in the highest exposed group in the 66-month test cohort is, therefore, considered a NOAEL for SCDS and is used by ATSDR as the basis for derivation of a chronic oral MRL formethylmercury. A related study (Myers et al. 1997) by some members of the same team of researchersfrom the University of Rochester examined the Seychellois child ren for attainment of the same developmental milestones reported to have been dela yed in the Iraqi poisoning incident in the early 1970s (Cox et al. 1989); however, unlike the Iraqi study, no dela ys in the age of first walking and talking was seen in the Seychellois children exposed in utero. Sensitivity of Neurobehavioral Measures /Reliability of Tests The neurobehavioral test battery used in the 66-month Seychelles study was designed to assess multiple developmental domains (Davidson et al. 1998). The test s were considered to be sufficiently sensitive and accurate to detect neurotoxicity in the presence of a num ber of statistical covariates. On-site test adminis- tration reliability was assessed by an independent scorer, and mean interclass correlations for interscorer reliability were 0.96-0.97 (Davidson et al. 1998). The sam ple size was determined to be sufficient to detect a 5.7-point difference on any test with a mean (SD) of 100 (16) between low (0-3 ppm) and high (>12 ppm) hair mercury concentration groups for a 2-sided test (A = 0.05 at 80% power).MERCURY 240 2. HEALTH EFFECTS Supporting Studies Crump et al. (1998) conducted benchmark dose (BMD ) calculations and additional regression analyses of data collected in a study in which a series of scholastic and psychological tests were administered tochildren whose mothers had been exposed to meth ylmercury during pregnancy. Hair samples were collected from 10,970 new mothers in New Zealand in 1977 and 1978. High hair mercury levels were considered to be those over 6 ppm, which was the ha ir level predicted to result at steady state from consumption of mercury at the WHO/FAO Provisiona l Tolerable Weekly Intake of 0.3 mg total mercury/week and 0.2 mg methylmercury/week. By this criterion, 73 of approximately 1,000 mothers who had consumed fish more than 3 times/week during pre gnancy were determined to have high hair mercury levels. In 1985, when the children were 6 to 7 years of age, 61 children (1 set of twins) of the 73 mothers in the high hair mercury group were located; these child ren constituted the high e xposure group, which was matched with three control groups (one with 3-6 ppm maternal hair mercury levels, one with 0-3 ppm whose mothers had been high fish consumers, and one with 0-3 ppm whose mothers had not been high fish consumers). The entire study cohort consisted of 237 children. A battery of 26 psychological and scholastic tests were administered to the children at school during the year 1985. Mothers were interviewed at the time of test administration to obtain additional da ta on social and environmental factors. In the high exposure group of children, one boy's mother had a hair mercury level of 86 ppm, which was more than four times higher than the next highest hair mercury level of 20 ppm. BMDs (10% response rate) calculated from five tests ranged from 32 to 73 ppm, when the 86 ppm mother's child was included. Thiscorresponded to a BMDL range of 17 to 24 ppm. A lthough none of the 86 ppm child's test scores was an outlier according to the definition used in the analy ses, his scores were significantly influential in the analyses. When this child was omitted from the an alyses, BMDs ranged from 13 to 21, with corresponding BMDLs of 7.4 to 10 ppm. Developing fetuses in the SCDS were exposed thr ough maternal fish ingestion before and during pregnancy. Each child was evaluated at 19 months and again at 29 months (\u00b12 weeks) for infant intelligence (Bayley Scales of Infant Development [BSID] Mental and Psychomotor Scales), with a modified version of the BSID Infant Behavior R ecord to measure adaptive behaviors at 29 months (Davidson et al. 1995b). Testing was performed by a team of Seychellois nurses extensively trained in administration of the BSID. Maternal hair concentr ations, measured in hair segments that corresponded to pregnancy, ranged from 0.5 to 26.7 ppm, with a median exposure of 5.9 ppm for the entire study group. The mean BSID Mental Scale Indices determined at both 19 and 29 months were found to be comparable MERCURY 241 2. HEALTH EFFECTS to the mean performance of U.S. children. The BSID Psychomotor Scale Indices at both measurement intervals were two standard devia tion units above U.S. norms, but we re still consistent with previous findings of motor precocity in children reared in Afri can countries. The study found no effect that could be attributed to mercury on the BSID scores obtained at either the 19- or 29-month measurement/testinginterval. The 29-month cohort represented 94% of th e 779 mother-infant pairs initially enrolled in the study, and approximately 50% of all live births in the Seychelles in 1989. The only observation in the 29-month testing that might be attributable to prenatal mercury exposure was a slight decrease in the activity level in boys (but not girls) as determined by the Bayley Infant Behavior Record (subjective observation). Whereas this decr ease was significant in males (p = 0.0004), it was not statistically significant in females (p = 0.87). Wh en the subjective activity scores for male and female children were evaluated collectively, no statistically significant or remarkable decrease in activity was apparent outside the >12 ppm maternal hair concentra tion group. The affect on activity level in boys is not considered an adverse effect by the authors of the study. Grandjean et al. (1997b, 1998) reported another epidem iological study of methylmercury exposure for a population in the Faroe Islands. Although the Faroese are a fishing culture, the major source ofmethylmercury exposure for this population is pilot whal e meat, which is intermittently consumed as part of the cultural tradition. The initial study cohort consisted of 1,022 singleton births occurring in a 21-month window during 1986-1987. At approximately 7 years of age, neurobehavioral testing was conducted on 917 of the remaining cohort members. No abnormalities attributable to mercury were found during clinical examinations or neurophysiological t esting. A neuropsychological test battery was also conducted, which included the following: Finger Tapping; Hand-Eye Coordination; reaction time on a Continuous Performance Test; Wechsler Intelligence Scal e for Children - Revised Digit Spans, Similarities, and Block Designs; Bender Visual Motor Gestalt Test; Boston Naming Test; and California Verbal Learning Test (Children). Neuropsychological tests emphasized motor coordination, perceptual-motorperformance, and visual acuity. Pattern reversal visu al evoked potentials (VEP) with binocular full-field stimulation, brain stem auditory evoked potentials (B AEP), postural sway, and the coefficient of variation for R-R inter-peak intervals (CVRR) on the electrocar diogram were all measured. The neuropsychological testing indicated mercury-related dysfunction in the domains of language, attention, memory, and visuospatial and motor function (to a lesser extent), which the authors considered to remain after the children of women with maternal hair mercury con centrations above 10 \u00b5g/g (10 ppm) were excluded. While this study represents a significant contributi on to the human database for methylmercury exposure MERCURY 242 2. HEALTH EFFECTS and effects, a number of potentially influential factor s not fully considered as possible covariates somewhat cloud the interpretation of the results. These differences between the neuropsychological eff ects observed in the Faroe Island cohort and the absence of effects reported in the Seychelles Island cohor t might result from a variety of factors. The Faroe Island children were older (7-8 years ve rsus 5.5 in the SCDS). Some of the measurement instruments (i.e., the neuropsychological test administered) were also di fferent. Since the first neuropsychological testing in the Faroe study was not conducted until 7 years of ag e, it is not known whether the observed effects might have been apparent at an earlier age. Ongoing and planned future testing of the Seychelles population will provide additional information on the progression of an y observed effects. Further examination of the Seychelles population using the neuropsychological test that showed positive results in the Faroe Island population will also allow a more direct comparison of results. The diet in the two studies was also considerably diffe rent. The majority of the mercury exposure to the Faroe Island population came from whale meat (estimated at about 3 ppm in muscle tissue) with a relativelysmall portion coming from fish. Some of the mercury in whale meat is in the form of inorganic mercury. In the Seychelles study, all of the mercury came from fish as methylmercury with concentrations of around0.3 ppm. Whale meat blubber is widely consumed in the Faroe Islands and also contains polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). Grandjean et al. (1995b) estimated a daily intake of 200 \u00b5g of PCB. This value can be compared to the Tolerable Daily Intake of PCBs established by the FDA of 60-70 \u00b5g/day for an adult. Further statistical analysis of the possible influen ce of PCBs on the observed study results needs to be conducted (see the discussion below on Peer Panel 1Review of Key Studies for additional comments). The primary biomarker used to estimate mercury exposur e was also different in the two studies. The Faroe Island analysis used cord blood, and the Seychelles study used maternal hair level. The use of mercury in cord blood has the advantage of being a more direct measu re of exposure to the fetus, but the levels at term may not reflect exposures at earlier developmental st ages. While Grandjean et al. (1997) did report maternal hair mercury levels, the mean hair level for the interquartile range of 2.6-7.7 ppm was reported only as a geometric average (4.27 ppm). In contrast, the Seychelles study reported only an arithmetic meanlevel for the entire study population (6.8 ppm). While both are valid measures, a direct comparison of\"average\" values for the two studies is not possible wit hout further statistical analysis of both data sets.MERCURY 243 2. HEALTH EFFECTS In the case of the Faroe study, no data were presen ted in the peer-reviewed publications to address variability of food/whale meat or blubber intake am ong the Faroe Islanders, making it difficult to evaluate the possibility of peak intake levels during critical development phases. Consum ption data were reported only as <1 pilot whale meat meal/month and 1-2 fish meals per week. In contrast, the Seychelles dietaryhabits provide a relatively stable intake, and a high degree of correlation was found between mean hair levels in samples covering each trimester and levels in samples for the entire pregnancy (Cernichiari et al. 1995a). Cernichiari et al. (1995b) also report a good corre lation between levels of total mercury in neonatal brain and levels in the corresponding maternal hair. While the contribution of continued mercury exposure through breast feeding or post-weaning diet was not fully addressed in the Seychelles study reports(Davidson 1995, 1998), that is not considered a significant drawback of the study, since no effects onneurobehavioral/neuropsychological testing were seen at any maternal hair level. In the Faroese assessment of latent neuropsychological effects from an in utero exposure to mercury, however, the role of continuing postnatal exposure to mercury either from breast milk or from ingestion of methylmercury-containing foods (e.g., pilot whale meat) is less clear. Specifically, it is not known what proportion, if any, of theneuropsychological effects reported in the Faroe Isla nds population could be attributed to 7 years of postnatal exposure to methylmercury in food. The variability and magnitude of this postnatal exposure should, therefore, be further evaluated. Peer Panel Review of Key Studies In addition to the traditional peer review process that precedes publication in most scientific journals, the studies considered by ATSDR for use in estimating a chronic oral MRL for methylmercury underwent two stringent reviews by recognized experts in the environmental health field. On July 20 and 21, 1998, ATSDR assembled a panel of 18 experts from the scientific and medical communities to review current issues and the releva nt literature on mercury and its compounds, including methylmercury (ATSDR 1999). Several members of each of the respective research teams that conductedthe Iraqi, Seychelles, Faroe, and Madeira studies we re included among the expert panelists, and provided extensive overviews of their studies. The presentati ons were followed by an open, wide-ranging scientific discussion of the merits and interpretations of the currently available studies. Topics of significantdiscussion included the relative merits of the respec tive study populations, exposure regimens, sensitivity of neurobehavioral measures, and determination of an uncertainty factor. While it was unanimously agreed that the Seychelles and Faroe studies were both excelle nt studies that provided a significant contribution to MERCURY 244 2. HEALTH EFFECTS the human database for methylmercury exposure and effects, a number of factors that could have contributed to the study results, but were not consid ered as possible statistical covariates, were discussed. In the case of the Faroe study, the consumption of wh ale blubber, which is known to be contaminated with PCBs, DDT, and possibly other organochlorines, introduces a potentially significant influence on the studyresults. Weihe et al. (1996) reported that the PCB a nd DDT concentrations in blubber of pilot whales taken in Faroese waters are about 30 ppm and 20 ppm, respectiv ely. In contrast, the Seychellois population does not eat marine mammals at all. In addition, the Faroe study did not address other possible statisticalcovariates, such as the dietary and nutritional status of the study population and the use of tobacco duringpregnancy, further complicating the interpre tation of the neuropsychological test results. On November 18-20, 1998, a workshop on Scientific Issu es Relevant to the Assessment of Health Effects from Exposure to Methylmercury was conducted in Ra leigh, North Carolina. The workshop was jointly sponsored by the U.S. Department of Health a nd Human Services (DHHS), the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS), the Center s for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the National Oceanicand Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP), the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), and ATSDR. The purpose of this workshop was to discuss and evaluate the major epidemiologic st udies that associated methylmercury exposure and the results of an array of developmental measures in children. These st udies monitored and evaluated exposed populations in Iraq, the Seychelles Islands, the Faroe Islands, and th e Amazon River Basin. A number of animal studies were also considered in support of a human health risk assessment. Presentation of each study by the research team that conducted the study was followed by an expert panel evaluation that examined each study, taking into consideration the exposure data, e xperimental design and statistical analysis, potential confounders and variables, and neurobe havioral end points evaluated. A fifth panel evaluated the results of relevant animal studies. Significant issues that we re discussed included the use of umbilical cord blood mercury levels versus hair mercury concentrati ons as an index of methylmercury exposure during pregnancy, the patterns of exposure, the dietary/health status of study populations , other potentially relevant exposures, other confounding influences, and the adjust ments made for statistical covariates. All five panels at this workshop commended the efforts of the investigators and respective staffs of the Seychelles and Faroe studies for conducting highly sophisticated investigations under difficult conditions. However, specific findings of several of the panels raise i ssues that, at present, preclude the Faroe data from consideration as a starting point for MRL derivation. MERCURY 245 2. HEALTH EFFECTS In addressing the potential influence of concurrent PCB exposure on the Faroe results, the Confounders and Variables (Epidemiology) panel indicated that with respect to four of the prenatal outcomes (related primarily to verbal and memory performance), when PCBs were included in the model, only one of these outcomes is specifically related to mercury exposure. Concerning this matter, the panel wrote that \"... the most likely explanation is that both (mercury and PCBs)... affect these three outcomes, but their relativecontributions cannot be determined given their c oncurrence in this population.\" The Neurobehavioral Endpoints Panel also looked at this issue, and noted that \"PCB exposure might act as an effect modifier,increasing the susceptibility to MeHg\"; however, this panel further indicated that it did not believe that the effects seen in the Faroe Islands were due to uncontrolled confounding by PCBs. A third panel that addressed the issue of concurrent PCB exposures, the Statistics/Design Panel, noted that only 3 of 208 PCB congeners were measured in the Faroe study, and st ated that it \"seems likely that mercury was measured more accurately than the biologically relevant PCB expos ure. Consequently even if the neurological effects seen in this study were caused entirely by PCBs, it is possible that mercury would still be more highly correlated with these effects than PCBs.\" The Statisti cs/Design Panel also said that \"the best method to deal with this problem would be to study a population where exposure to PCBs is not an issue.\" This statement points directly to the Seychelles study as the study most appropriate for MRL derivation. Another issue raised at Raleigh workshop concerned the taking of hair samples for determining pre-natal exposure. In the Seychelles, hair samples were collected 6 months post-partum, and segments corresponding to pregnancy were selected for analysis. In the case of the Faroese, hair samples were taken at the scalp. Regarding that, the Confounders and Variab les (Epidemiology) panel stated that \"Given the time it takes the Hg to be excreted into the hair, we can assume that samples collected at parturition do not cover the last 6 weeks of gestation, during whic h critically important neuronal proliferation and differentiation is taking place.\" Regarding the Seychelles and Faroe studies, the Neurobehavioral Endpoints Panel found \"no specific neurobehavioral signature injury from MeHg\" in the da ta from either study (Seychelles or Faroe). The same panel also noted that episodic exposure in th e Faroese (1-2 fish meals/week and <1 pilot whale meal/month) \"may reduce the likelihood of detecting a consistent 'neurobehavioral signature injury' specific to MeHg and may account for different observa tions in children with the same average exposure.\" Based upon the discussions at the Raleigh workshop and the individual panel findings, as well as the aforementioned Atlanta expert panel review, ATSDR h as determined that the Seychelles study represents MERCURY 246 2. HEALTH EFFECTS the most appropriate and reliable database currently av ailable for calculation of a chronic oral MRL from a population exposed only to methylmercury by a releva nt route of exposure for the overall U.S. population. Again, ATSDR would like to strongly emphasize that both the Seychelles study and the Faroese study represent credible scientific contributions by widely respected research teams. Similarly, both studies extend our knowledge base well beyond that provided by the Iraqi study and make significant contributions to our understanding of the effects of low-level e xposure to methylmercury by an exposure route and vehicle (i.e., food) relevant to U.S. populations . The continuing monitoring and evaluation of the Seychellois and Faroese populations with more compar able neurobehavioral indices should help strengthen our understanding of the effects of low-level chr onic methylmercury exposure and should reduce the uncertainty regarding the public h ealth implications of exposure. Other Key Studies Reviewed by ATSDR Other epidemiology studies were also considered by ATSDR in evaluating the database on human exposure to methylmercury. Lebel et al. (1996) evaluated a fi sh-eating populations in the Amazon River Basin with a neurofunctional test battery and clinical manifestati ons of nervous system dysfunction in relation to hair mercury concentrations. The villagers examined live along the Tapajos River, a tributary of the Amazon. The study population consisted of 91 a dult inhabitants 15-31 years of age. Hair mercury levels were below 50 \u00b5g/g (ppm). Clinical examinations were essen tially normal, although persons displaying disorganized movements on an alternating movement task and those w ith restricted visual fields generally had higher hair mercury levels. Near visual contrast, sensitivity, and manual dexterity (adjusted for age) were found to decrease significantly with increasing mercury levels, while a tendency for muscular fatigue and decreasing strength were observed in women. The authors sugg ested that dose-dependent nervous system alterations might be associated with hair mercury levels belo w 50 ppm. This study, however, also had a number of potentially confounding factors. The impact of paras itic and other diseases endemic to the study area is of primary concern in the interpretation of the Lebel et al. (1996) results. In addition, the overall nutritional status of the study population was not known or repor ted, and the use of neuroactive drugs (from local herbs, plants, roots, or mushrooms) was not cons idered as a potential confounder or covariate. The previous mercury exposure history of the study cohort is also unclear. This is of particular importance because gold mining procedures that use metallic mercury have been commonly practiced along theAmazon Basin for decades. Finally, the end points of th e Lebel et al. (1977) study evaluated adult toxicity and not effects in the developing fetus or the newborn (i.e., the most sensitive human population).MERCURY 247 2. HEALTH EFFECTS Myers et al. (1997) evaluated the population of the SC DS for developmental milestones similar to those determined in Iraq. As part of this ongoing study, cohort children were evaluated at 6.5, 19, 29, and 66 months of age. At 19 months care-givers were asked at what age the child walked (n=720 out of 738) and talked (n=680). Prenatal mercury exposure was de termined by atomic absorption analysis of maternal hair segments corresponding to hair growth during the pregnancy. The median mercury level in maternal hair for the cohort in this analysis was 5.8 ppm, with a range of 0.5-26.7 ppm. The mean age (in months) at walking was 10.7 (SD=1.9) for females and 10.6 (SD=2.0) for males. The mean age for talking (in months)was 10.5 (SD=2.6) for females, and 11 (SD=2.9) for ma les. After adjusting for covariates and statistical outliers, no association was found between the age at wh ich Seychellois children walked or talked and prenatal exposure to mercury. The ages for achieveme nt of the developmental milestones were normal for walking and talking in the Seychellois toddlers fo llowing prenatal exposure to methylmercury from a maternal fish diet. Clarkson (1995) raised some interesting issues concerni ng whether is it reasonable to apply health effects data based on an acute exposure to methylmercury fungicide eaten in homemade bread (in the 1971-1972Iraq incident) to fish-eating populations having chronic exposure to much lower concentrations of methyl- mercury. He addressed two specific issues. The firs t regards the body's \"defense mechanisms\" that serve to mitigate the potential damage from mercury. One su ch mechanism in the case of methylmercury involves an enterohepatic cycling process in which methyl mercury from dietary sources absorbed through the intestine is carried to the liver, where substantial qua ntities are secreted back into the bile and returned to the intestinal tract. During the residence time in the gut, microflora break the carbon-mercury bond, converting methylmercury into inorganic mercury, which in turn is poorly absorbed and is excreted in the feces. This creates an effective detoxification path way for low-dose dietary exposures to methylmercury, but probably not for acute, high-dose exposures, such as occurred in Iraq. Secondly, the transport of methylmercury into brain tissue is inhibited by the presence of many amino acids, including leucine,methionine, and phenylalanine. Thus, it is possible that the rising plasma concentrations of amino acids from ingestion of fish protein may serve to depress the uptake of methylmercury by the brain. While both of these issues need further laboratory/clini cal investigation, they do raise appropriate questions concerning the relevance of the relatively short-term (i.e., about 6 weeks), high-level contaminated grain exposure scenario encountered in Iraq to the diet ary methylmercury exposure scenarios encountered in many fish-eating populations (e.g., the Seychelles Isla nders, Faroe Islanders, Per uvian villagers, and Inuit native people of Greenland). This position is supporte d by Cicmanec (1996), who reviewed data from the MERCURY 248 2. HEALTH EFFECTS Iraqi study, as well as data from studies of fish-cons uming populations in the Faroe Islands, Seychelles Islands, and Peruvian fishing villages. Cicmanec c oncluded that the Iraqi population does not represent a sensitive subpopulation within a perinatal group; rather , the relatively lower threshold identified in that study was the result of confounders. Crump et al. ( 1995) reanalyzed the dose-response data from the Cox et al. (1989) report of the Iraqi incident and found the resu lts to be potentially skewed by inadequacies in the study design and data-collection me thods. Shortcomings or potentially confounding factors include: (1) the retrospective recall of developmental milestones by mothers and other family members; (2) the lack of precision in the determination of birth and other milestone dates; (3) and the possible biasing of the dose-response analysis by variation in symptom repor ting and infant sex composition in the two study subcohorts. Crump et al. (1995) noted that perhaps th e most serious limitation of the Iraqi study is the inability to assess the potential effects of low-level ch ronic-duration exposure to methylmercury, as these particular data are based on very high intake levels over a relatively brief period of time. No increase in the frequency of neurodevelopmenta l abnormalities in early childhood was observed in a cohort of 131 infant-mother pairs in Mancora, Peru (Marsh et al. 1995b). The mean concentration of mercury in maternal hair was determined to be 8. 3 ppm (range, 1.2-30 ppm), and the source of the mercury was believed to be from consumption of marine fish. Similarly, a study of 583 Faroe Island infants for the first 12 months after birth found no decrease in the age of attainment of sitting, creeping (crawling), and standing developmental milestones (Grandjean et al. 1995a ). The age at which a child reached a particular developmental milestone was not only not found to be associated with prenatal mercury exposure, but infants that reached a milestone early were found to have significantly higher mercury concentrations in their hair at 12 months of age. It was also found that early milestone attainment was clearly associated withbreast-feeding, which was in turn related to higher infant hair mercury levels. The authors (Grandjean et al. 1995a) concluded that the beneficial effects associ ated with breast-feeding seemed to overrule, or to compensate for, any neurotoxic effects on milestone development that could be due to the presence ofcontaminants (e.g., mercury) in human milk. Additional studies have shown developm ental toxicity after oral exposure of humans and animals to organic mercury compounds (Amin-Zaki et al. 1974; Bakir et al. 1972; Boush 1975; 1976; Stoltenburg-Didinger and Markwort 1990).MERCURY 249 2. HEALTH EFFECTS The accumulation of mercury is greater in larger fish a nd in fish higher in the food chain. The tendency for increased mercury concentration with increasing fish body weight is particularly noticeable in carnivorous fish species. Malm et al. (1995) analyzed mercury c oncentrations in 16 species of carnivorous fish from the Tapajos River basin in Brazil and hair samples from local populations who regularly ate such fish. Mercury levels in the fish averaged 0.55 ppm (range, 0.04-3.77 ppm), and the mercury levels in the hair of the affected fish-eating populations averaged approximate ly 25 ppm. In one population that consumed higher quantities of large carnivorous fish at the end of the local rainy season, 8 of 29 persons evaluated had hair mercury levels above 40 ppm, and one individual had a hair mercur y concentration of 151 ppm. Some villages along the river can have per capita daily fish consumption rates around 200 g or more, which would greatly impact the human body burden and hair levels of mercury in such populations. Hair-to-Blood Concentration Ratio The hair:blood concentration ratio for total mercury is frequently cited as 250. However, a precise basis for this particular value is unclear. Ratios reported in the literature range from 140 to 416, a difference of more than a factor of 2.5 (see Table 2-9). Differences in th e location of hair sampled (head versus chest, distance of sample from head or skin) may contribute to di fferences in observed ratios between studies. For example, as much as a 3-fold seasonal variation in mercur y levels was observed in average hair levels for a group of individuals with moderate-t o-high fish consumption rates, with yearly highs occurring in the fall and early winter (Phelps et al. 1980; Suzuki et al. 1992). Thus, it is important to obtain hair samples asclose to the follicle as possible to obtain an estimate of recent blood levels. Large errors (the direction of which depends on whether samples were taken while blood levels were falling or rising) could result if hair samples are not taken close to the scalp. Several studi es did not report the distance to the scalp for the hair samples taken. The high slope reported by Tsubaki (1971a ) may have reflected the fact that mercury levels were declining at the time of sampling (Berglund et al . 1971), so the hair levels may reflect earlier, higher blood levels. Hair taken from different parts of the body also may yield different ratios. In 26 subjects with moderate-to-high fish consumption, axillary hair (i.e., from the armpit area) was found to contain an average of 23% less mercury than head hair (Skerfving et al. 1974). Phelps et al. (1980) obtained multiple blood samples and sequentially analyzed lengths of hair from 339 individuals in Northwestern Ontario. The large sample size and the attention to sampling and analysiswith regard to the hair:blood relationship make the r esults from this study the most appropriate to use for estimating the mercury blood levels of the Seychellois women during pregna ncy. The actual ratio Phelps et MERCURY 251 2. HEALTH EFFECTS al. (1980) observed between the total mercury con centration in hair taken close to the scalp and simultaneous blood sampling for this group was 296. To estimate the actual ratio, the authors assumed that blood and hair samples were taken following complete cessation of methylmercury intake. They also assumed a half-life of methylmercury in blood of 52 days and a lag of 4 weeks for appearance of therelevant level in hair at the scalp. Based on these assu mptions, they calculated that if the actual hair:blood ratio were 200, they would have observed a ratio of 290 (i.e., essentially equivalent to the observed value of 296). Based on these and other considerations, Phelps et al. (1980) state that the actual ratio is \"probably higher than 200, but less than the observed value of 296.\" As the authors point out, two-thirds of the studypopulation were sampled during the falling phase of the seas onal variation and one-third or less in the rising phase. This fact would tend to result in a lower obser ved ratio; therefore, the actual average value is likely to be >200. Phelps et al. (1980) also provide estimates assuming a 2- week lag for the appearance of the relevant level of mercury in the centimeter of hair nearest the scalp. For a 2-week lag time, an actual ratio of 250 would have resulted in an observed ratio of 301 (again, essentia lly identical to the observed value of 296). A study of ingestion of a large dose of mercuric chloride in one individual suggests that the lag time is longer than 2 weeks (Suzuki et al. 1992). Hair samples were ta ken at 41 and 95 days following ingestion of the mercuric chloride. In the 41-day hair sample, a la rge mercury peak occurred in the centimeter of hair closest to the scalp, with no elevation in mercury in th e second centimeter of hair. Head hair grows at a rate of about 1.1 cm a month (Al-Shahristani and Shihab 1974; Cox et al. 1989). If emergence had occurred sothat the elevation in mercury could be measured in th e first centimeter of hair by 2 weeks after exposure, then by day 41 after exposure the peak should have moved into the second centimeter of hair, at least enough to raise the mercury level slightly in the second centimeter. Because no elevation was seen in the second centimeter of hair at 41 days, it would appear that emergence occurred at a lag of >2 weeks. In the hair sample taken at 95 days, the leading edge of the mercury peak occurred in the third centimeter of hair. Based on the data presented in Phelps et al. (1980) and the lag time indicated in the individual studied by Suzuki et al. (1992), the actual average value is lik ely to be somewhere between 200 and 250. Because the data do not allow a more accurate determination of an average ratio, the value 250 is acceptable for the purpose of estimating average blood levels in the Seyc hellois population. Using 250 rather than a lower number results in a lower MRL. It should be noted th at a wide range in hair:blood ratios has been reported for individuals in various studies: 137-342 in Soria et al. (1992), 171-270 in Phelps et al. (1980), 416 in MERCURY 252 2. HEALTH EFFECTS Cernichiari et al. (1995), and 137-585 in Birke et al. (1972) . Therefore, this ratio (250) should not be used as the sole basis for determining levels of exposure and potential effect for individuals. Calculation of dietary intake of mercury from blood concentration . Fraction of mercury in diet that is absorbed (AD). Radiolabeled methyl-mercuric nitrate was administered in water to three healthy volunteers (Aberg et al. 1969). The uptake was >95%. Miettinen et al. (1971) incubated fish liver homogenate MeHgNO3 to yield a methylmercury proteinate. The proteinate was then fed to fish that were kille d after a week, cooked, and fed to volunteers after confirmation of the methylmercury in the fish. Mean uptake exceeded 94%. For the derivation of an MRL, an absorption factor of 0.95 is used. Fraction of the absorbed dose that is found in the blood (AB). The value 0.05 has been used for this parameter in the past (Berglund et al. 1971; WHO 1990). Three studies report observations of the fractionof the absorbed methylmercury dose distributed to blood volume in humans. Kershaw et al. (1980) reportan average fraction of 0.059 of the absorbed dose in the total blood volume, based on a study of 5 adult male subjects who ingested methylmercury-contamin ated tuna. In a group of 9 male and 6 female volunteers who had received 203Hg-methylmercury in fish, approximately 10% of the total body burden was present in 1 L of blood in the first few days after exposure, dropping to approxi mately 5% over the first 100 days (Miettinen et al. 1971). In another study, an average value of 1.14% for the percentage of absorbed dose in 1 kg of blood was derived from subjects who consumed a known amount of methyl- mercury in fish over a period of 3 months (Sherloc k et al. 1984). Average daily intake for the 4 groups observed in the study ranged from 43 to 233 \u00b5g/day. The authors report a dose-related effect on the estimated percentage of the absorbed dose in 1 kg of blood, with 1.26% of the absorbed dose in 1 kg of blood at an average daily intake of 43 \u00b5g/day and 1.03% of the absorbed dose in 1 kg of blood at anaverage daily intake of 233 \u00b5g/day. The average for all subjects in the study was 1.14%. When individual values for distribution to one kilogram of blood reporte d in the study are converted into the percentage of the absorbed dose in the total blood volume (assuming that blood is 7% of body weight [Best 1961] andusing body weights reported for individuals in the study), the average value for A B for all individuals is 0.056 (0.057 using the values for percentage in 1 kg nor malized for body weight as reported in the study). The average value for AB for 6 women as reported in Sherlock et al. (1984) is 0.048 (0.047 using values normalized for body weight). The average for 14 men is 0.059 (0.061 using values normalized for bodyweight). MERCURY 253 2. HEALTH EFFECTS The average values for AB for all studies ranged from 0.047 to 0.061 (the values for women and men reported in Sherlock et al. [1984]). The data suggest that the average value of AB for women may be lower than that for men, and they further suggest that 0. 05 may be appropriate for m odeling intake in a group of women (Sherlock et al. 1984). Based on these studies, the best estimate of AB based on the available data is 0.05. Use of a higher value (i.e., 0.06 instead of 0.05) for this parameter would result in a lower MRL, but the sensitive populations are pregnant women a nd developing fetuses, making the 0.5 value more appropriate for the Seychelles study population. Elimination constant (b) . Reported clearance half-times for methylmercury from blood or hair range from 48 to 65 days (Table 2-5). The average elimination constant based on the six studies listed in Table 2-5 is 0.014. The average of the individual values for b reported for 20 volunteers ingesting 42-233 \u00b5g Hg/day in fish for 3 months (Sherlock et al. 1984) is also 0.014. Use of the value 0.014 for this parameter, rather than 0.01 (as used by WHO 1990), results in a higher MRL. Volume of blood in body (V), and body weight . Blood volume is assumed to be 7% of body weight, with an increase to about 9% during pregnancy (Best 1961). Da ta for the body weight of the Seychelles Islands women were not found. Assuming an average body weight of 60 kg for women, the blood volume is 4.2 L(60 kg x 0.07 L/kg). The 9% of body weight value is not used because it is not representative of the blood volume throughout pregnancy. Blood volume does not begin to increase significantly from the 7% pre-pregnancy level until around the 27 th week of pregnancy. It then sharply rises until week 40 or parturition (Guyton 1996). To use the 9% value would, theref ore, be representative of the blood volume late in pregnancy (i.e., mid- to late- third trimester), but not throughout most of pregnancy. In contrast, the hair mercury level to which it is compared represents an average value throughout pregnancy. The use of the 9% value would result in a higher MRL, and is not considered appropriate in this instance. Calculation of Exposure Dose The concentration of mercury in hair is assumed to be 250 times the concentration in blood. ATSDR's peer-reviewed, published guidance for MRL derivation (Chou et al. 1998) calls for the use of the highest value at which no adverse effects were observed in the critical study. Using, therefore, the 15.3 ppm meanmaternal hair (taken at parturition) value fro m the highest exposure group (range, 12-26.7 ppm) in the Seychellois test population as a NOAEL for the 66-mont h Seychelles testing (Davidson et al. 1998), the corresponding methylmercury concentration in blood would be: 1/250 x 15.3 \u00b5g/g 1 mg/1,000 \u00b5g x C'f(d b(V'AD(AB(d b(VConverting blood mercury concen tration to daily intake. The concentration of mercury in the blood may be convert ed to a daily intake by using the following equation from WHO (1990): Where: C = concentration in blood f = fraction of the daily intake taken up by the blood d = daily dietary intakeb = elimination constant A D= percent of mercury intake in diet that is absorbed AB= percent of the absorbed amount that enters the blood V = volume of blood in the body where: C = (0.95 x 0.05 x d)/(0.014 x 4.2) C = 0.81 d 0.061 mg = 0.81 dd = 0.075 mg/day Using the assumed body weight of 60 kg for women, the estimated dose that would result in a hair level of 15.3 ppm is 0.075/60 kg = 0.0013 mg/kg/day. Theref ore, the NOAEL derived from the highest exposure group (n = 95) at 66 months is 0.0013 mg/kg/day. Consideration of Uncertainty The standard/traditional areas of uncertainty addressed in any duration-specific MRL intra-human variability (i.e.,differences in susceptibility to a substance or effect w ithin the human population); (3) use of an LOAEL for MRL derivation when an NOAEL for the critical effect is not available; and (4) extrapolation from subchronic to chronic duration. In addition, a modifyi ng factor may also be used when special circumstances exist that may contribute to, or introduce, uncertainty into the calculated health guidance value (MRL) in an area not typically covered by the traditional uncertainty factor approach.MERCURY 255 2. HEALTH EFFECTS The NOAEL of 15.3 ppm mercury in maternal hair from Davidson et al. (1998) used as the starting point for MRL derivation was based upon an unusually large study cohort of the population considered most sensitive to the neurodevelopmental effects of methylmercury, i. e., pregnant women and their developing fetuses. The negative results of this study are strongly supporte d by the BMD NOAEL range of 13 to 21 ppm calculated for the New Zealand cohort of 237 mother-child pairs (Crump et al. 1998). Consequently, much of the uncertainty normally present in the MRL derivation pr ocess does not exist in the case of methylmercury. Nonetheless, in view of the nature of the most susceptible group (developing fetuses) and some questions raised in the vast human data base for this ch emical, an aggregate value of 4.5 was employed. This value (4.5) was based upon three separate compone nts, two of which are interrelated and the other independent. For the Seychelles data, a value of 1.5 was used to address variability in hair-to-blood ratios among women and fetuses in the U.S. population, as dete rmined by pharmacokinetic modeling of actual data by Clewell et al. (1998); a second value of 1.5 was a pplied to address the remainder of any inter-individual variability (i.e., pharmacodynamics) in the U.S. populati on. A third, and independent, factor of 1.5 was employed to account for the possibility that the domain- specific tests, as employed extensively in the Faroe Islands, but not the Seychelles (which used primarily ne urobehavioral tests of global function) might be able to detect very subtle neurological effects not tested for in the 66-month Seychelles cohort. The World Health Organization (WHO, 1993, 1996) has defined the -kinetic and -dynamic components of intrahuman variability as being equal contributors to, and collectively constituting the total of, human variability. In order to assure a conservative appro ach, these two interdependent components were added to give a composite uncertainty factor of three (i.e., 1. 5 + 1.5 = 3) to account for the full range of variability attributable to mercury in the Seychelles study. A modifying factor of 1.5 was also used to account for the possibility of domain-specific effects, as were seen in th e Faroe study, being attributable to mercury. Since these effects were considered to be entirely separate or \"independent\" events, this modifying factor of 1.5 was multiplied by the uncertainty factor of 3.0 (for uncertainty attributable solely to the Seychelles study) to yield an aggregate uncertainty of 4.5 for chronic oral exposure to methylmercury. While domain-specific tests from the Seychelles were reviewed at the North Carolina meeting in November 1998 and the results failed to demonstrate effects, the tests do not represent the full range of domain-specific tests that were administered in the Faroe Islands. For these reasons, and based on our consultation with our Board of Scien tific Counselors about concerns for \"m issing\" data sets (i.e., in relation to the Executive Order of children's health and the agency's efforts to protect the health of children, including the developing fetus), ATSDR determined that an additi onal factor of 1.5 should be used since the full range of MERCURY 256 2. HEALTH EFFECTS domain-specific neuropsychological test results from the Seychelles are not yet available. When these results become available and if they fail to show domain-speci fic effects, this additional factor of 1.5 would no longer be needed. At that time ATSDR will re-evalu ate its MRL, as well as all other relevant data, in compliance with the agency's mandates and authorities. Therefore, in the calculation of the chronic oral MRL for methylmercury, the NOAEL of 0.0013 mg/kg/day from the 66-month study (Davidson et al. 1998) is divided by 4.5, giving a chronic oral MRL formethylmercury of Derivations of the MRL To ensure a health guidance value b ased upon the best use of the Seychelles study data (widely considered the most relevant data available), ATSDR evaluated alte rnate MRL derivation methods for methylmercury. One such approach is to use the mean total mercury level of 6.8 ppm in maternal hair for the entire Seychellois study cohort. Using the same formula as in the previous MRL calculation, C = (0.95 x 0.05 x d) / (0.014 x 4.2) C = 0.81 d(1/250 x 6.8) mg/L = 0.81 mg/day0.034 mg/day / 60 kg = 0.0006 mg/kg/day In consideration of uncertainty factors for this MRL appr oach, multiple factors also apply. In this case, the mean value of 6.8 ppm for the NOAEL is for the entire study cohort at 66 months (n = 711). An uncertaintyfactor of 1.5 was used to account for the pharmacoki netically based variability of hair-to-blood ratios (95% confidence level) in pregnant women and fetuses in the U.S. population (Clewell et al. 1998, 1999). The extremely large size of the study population (n=711), in combination with an uncertainty factor of 1.5, isconsidered adequate to encompass the full range of pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic variability within the human population. An independent modify ing factor of 1.5 was also used to take into consideration the positive results of the domain-specifi c tests administered in the Faroe study (Grandjean et al. 1997, 1998). The uncertainty factor of 1.5, multiplied by the modifying factor of 1.5, yields a totalaggregate value of 2.25. Applying the factor of 2.25 to the daily intake calculated from the 6.8 ppm MERCURY 257 2. HEALTH EFFECTS NOAEL yields a chronic MRL value of 0.0003 mg/kg/day methylmercury (0.0006 mg/kg/day divided by 2.25 = 0.0003 mg/kg/day). A third approach to deriving a health guidance value is the use of bench mark dose (BMD) modeling. Clewell et al. (1998) used a benchmark dose analysis to dete rmine a reference dose (RfD, a health guidance value used by the Environmental Protection Agency and, in some ways, the equivalent of ATSDR's chronic oral MRL). Clewell et al. (1998) used the data from the 29-month test in the Seychellois population (Davidson et al. 1995b) for their analysis (i.e., the 66-month study ha d not been published at the time of their benchmark dose analysis). The BMD is calculated by fitting a ma thematical dose-response model to dose-response data. The bench mark dose level (BMDL) is a lower st atistical confidence bound on the BMD and replaces the NOAEL in the calculation of a health guidance value. The BMD approach has been proposed as superior to the use of \"average\" or \"grouped\" exposure estimates wh en dose-response information is available, as is the case for the Seychelles study. Clewell et al. (1998) note that the Faroe Islands study reported by Grandjean et al. (1997b) could not be used for dose-response modeli ng due to inadequate repor ting of the data and the confounding influence of co-exposure to PCBs. For the 29-month Seychelles data, Clewell et al. (1998) used the 95% lower bound on the 10% benchmark dose level (BMDL), which represents a conservative estimate of the traditional NOAEL. The benchmark dose modeling over the entire range of neurological e ndpoints reported by Davidson et al. (1995b) yielded a lowest BMDL10 of 21 ppm methylmercury in maternal hair. This BMDL10 was then converted to an expected distribution of daily ingestion rates across a population of U.S. women of child-bearing age by using a Monte Carlo analysis with a physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model of methyl- mercury developed by Gearhart et al. (1995). Th is analysis addresses the impact of interindividual pharmacokinetic variability on the rela tionship between ingestion rate a nd hair concentration for methyl- mercury. The resulting distribution had a geomet ric mean value of 0.00160 mg/kg/day (S.D. 0.00133). The 1st, 5th, and 10th stribution were 0.00086, 0.00104, and 0.00115 mg/kg/day, respectively. Clewell et al. (1998) suggested th at the 5th percentile of 0.00104 mg/kg/day provides a scientifically based, conservative b asis that incorporates the pharmacokinetic variability across the U.S. population of child-bearing women and that no other uncertainty factor for interindividual variability would be needed. To the benchmark-estimated NOAEL of 21 ppm derived from the Seychelles 29-month data, Clewell et al. (1998) applied an uncertainty fact or of 3 to account for data base limitations. (Note: The 66-month Seychelles data was not yet published at th e time; hence the reliance on the 29-month Seychelles MERCURY 258 2. HEALTH EFFECTS data for the benchmark analysis.) Consequently, Clewell et al. (1998) concluded that using a NOAEL of 7 ppm (21 ppm / 3 (UF) provides additional protection agai nst the possibility that effects could occur at lower concentrations in some populations. Based upon this reasoning, Clewell and his colleagues recommended a health guidance value (i.e., an RfD) of 0.0004 mg/kg/day. If a modifying factor of 1.5 is used to further address the domain-specific findings in the Faroe study, a final MRL of 0.3 \u00b5g/kg/day results. The above benchmark analysis of 29-month data fro m the Seychelles Child Development Study strongly supports the MRL of 0.0003 mg/kg/day calculated by A TSDR in this profile. Similarly, addressing the Seychellois 66-month data from the pe rspective of using the mean value (15.3 ppm) of the highest exposure group in the study, a method prescribed in ATSDR's published guidance for MRL development (Chou et al. 1998), also results in an identical MRL. ATSDR theref ore has high confidence that this level is protective of the health of all potentially exposed human populations. Employment of the Chronic Oral MRL for Methylmercury It should be emphasized that the MRL is considered by ATSDR to be a level of exposure to a single chemical/substance which is considered \"safe\" fo r all potentially exposed populations for a specified duration of time (acute, intermediate, or chronic). It is not considered be a threshold for adverse effects, and not address the likelihood of adversity at any incrementa l level above the MRL value. ATSDR notes that the 0.3 \u00b5g/kg/day chronic oral MRL for methylmercury is in close agreement with the tolerable daily intake (ADI) levels of 0.47 and 0.48 \u00b5g/kg/day establis hed by the FDA and WHO, respectively. MRLs are, by definition (Chou et al. 1998), substan ce-specific and do not include effects attributable to interaction (whether additive, synergistic, or antagonistic) with other chemicals or environmental substances. Their relevance to the mission of A TSDR is to assist public health officials in the identification of chemicals/elements of potential h ealth concern at hazardous waste sites. The ATSDR MRL is not intended to be used in the regulatory or s ite clean-up process, but is instead intended to serve as a basis of comparison with actual measured levels of environmental exposure. Further, the role of informed biomedical judgment is crucial in the app lication of any MRL, or the media-specific health guidance values (HGVs) derived from them, in any given exposure scenario (Risher and De Rosa 1997). MRLs for a particular substance are based upon the mo st sensitive effect/endpoint in that portion of the human population considered to be most susceptible to injury from exposure to that substance. Thus, the MRL has never been intended as a one-size-fits-all t ool for all hazardous waste site exposure scenarios; rather, it is merely a starting point for further examin ation of potential health risk. Therefore, at sites MERCURY 259 2. HEALTH EFFECTS where methylmercury is present in combination with other known or suspected neurodevelopmental toxicants, such as lead or polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), and in which exposure is primarily episodic in nature, the health assessor might consider using a value below th e chronic oral MRL for methylmercury as a starting point for determination of further site investigation. (A more complete description of the uses of MRLs and other HGVs can be found in Chou et al. 1998 and Risher and De Rosa 1997.) Background and general population exposures relevant to the oral MRL for methylmercury Mercury hair levels have been m onitored in a variety of populations and generally range from 1 to 4 ppm, depending upon the level of fish cons umption. Table 2-10 summarizes the mean (or median) values and the maximum value from a number of these studies. Diet. Based on the FDA total diet study of 1982-1984 (Gunderson 1988), FDA estimated that the average intake for total mercury (both inorganic and orga nic) is 50-100 ng/kg/day. Based on the more recent 1989-1990 FDA total diet study, the estimated intake of total mercury is 27-60 ng/kg/day (Cramer 1994). An estimated 86% of the mercury in the total diet st udy is derived from fish (Tollefson and Cordle 1986). A separate estimate of the average intake of methylmercur y alone, based on a survey of fish eaters and average levels of methylmercury in fish, places the average intake of methylmercury at 36 ng/kg/day, with a 99% upper bound at 243 ng/kg/day (Clarkson 1990). Potential protective effect of selenium in fish . Selenium is known to bioconcentrate in fish, and selenium has been observed to correlate with mercury levels in the blood of fish consumed (Grandjean et al. 1992). Furthermore, there is evidence suggesting that consum ption of methylmercury from fish, in conjunction with other beneficial constituents in fish (e.g., omega-3 fatty acids) may not result in the same toxicity dose- response relationship observed with methylmercury expos ure from consumption of contaminated grain (as in the Iraqi population) (Davidson et al. 1998). Regarding the bioavailability of methylmercury in fi sh, the available data indicate that methylmercury uptake is not affected by its presence in fish. Experimental studies on the metabolism of methylmercury in humans following the ingestion of contaminated fish (using methylmercury bound to fish muscle protein)have shown that absorption is almost complete ( 95% absorbed) (Miettinen 1973). Animal studies also support this absorption value. Data on cats gi ven fish homogenates indicate absorptions of $90% of methylmercury, whether added to the homogenate, accumulated by fish in vivo , or from methylmercury proteinate (Berglund et al. 1971). Using blood and ti ssue levels as evidence of absorption, Charbonneau et al. (1976) concluded that there was no differen ce in the biological availability of methylmercury MERCURY 261 2. HEALTH EFFECTS administered to adult cats (0.003, 0.0084, 0.020, 0.046, 0.074, or 0.176 mg Hg/kg/day, 7 days a week for 2 years), either as pure methylmercuric chloride in corn oil added to a diet containing uncontaminated fish or as methylmercury-contaminated fish. In the two highest dose groups (0.074 and 0.176 mg Hg/kg bodyweight at 100 weeks of exposure), no significant differen ces were seen in total mercury concentrations in the blood between groups receiving the dose as methylmercuric chloride or as contaminated fish at the same dose level. In addition, monthly blood levels were compar able for all dose groups. No significant differences were seen at 100 weeks in total mercury concentrations in nervous tissue or other tissues (renal cortex, renal medulla, liver, spleen, adrenal, bladder, atria, ventri cle, ovary, testis, muscle) between the two highest dose groups receiving the dose as methylmercuric chloride or as contaminated fish at the same dose level. Regarding the effect of selenium on methylmercury t oxicity, most studies have shown that the simultaneous administration of mercury and selenium in equimolar doses to animals has resulted in decreased toxicity of both elements for acute- and chronic-duration exposures. This effect has been observed with inorganic and organic mercury and with either inorganic or organic selenium compounds, although inorganic forms of selenium appear to be more effective than organi c forms (Chang 1983; Skerfving 1978). Selenium protects against the acute nephrotoxicity of the mercuric ion and methylmercuric ion in rats (Ganther et al. 1972, 1980; Magos et al. 1987; Parizek and 1967) and possibly against acute neurotoxicity of methylmercuric ion in rats (Ohi et al. 1980). Somewhat paradoxically, the protective effect of selenium has been associated with a higher whole- body retention of mercury (Hansen 1988; Magos et al. 1987). In a study of selenium excretion in workers exposed to low levels of metallic mercury vapor in a chloralkali plant, Ellingsen et al. (1995) found that even in a low-to-moderate occupational e xposure, mercury may reduce the urinary selenium concentration in humans in a manner that is not yet fully known. Evidence from human autopsy tissues suggests that distribution of mercury throughout the body may be influenced by the presence of selenium (Suzuki et al. 1993). In this study, however, the level of selenium was found to negatively correlate with the level of mercury in some tissues including the cerebrum, spleen, and kidney cortex. Suzuki et al. (1993) also report that hair selenium values negatively correlate d with total organ mercury and inorganic mercury levels. The association between concentrations of i norganic mercury and selenium in both the occipital lobe and the thalamus of the brains of methylmercury-expo sed female monkeys was reported by Bjorkman et al. (1995). These authors observed a tendency to a \"hockey stick-shaped\" relationship between concentrations of selenium and inorganic mercury in the thalamus of monkeys with ongoing exposure to methylmercury, and MERCURY 262 2. HEALTH EFFECTS they postulated an important role for selenium in the re tention of mercury in the brain. These studies indicate that selenium has an effect on mercury toxicokinetics, although more study is needed to determine the nature of the interaction with respect to di fferent organs and exposure regimens. Although the specific mechanism for the protection is not well understood, possible mechanisms for selenium's protective effect include redistributi on of mercury (Mengel and Karlog 1980), competition by selenium for mercury-binding sites associated with toxi city, formation of a mercury-selenium complex that diverts mercury from sensitive targets (Hansen 1988; Magos et al. 1987; Naganuma and Imura 1981), and prevention of oxidative damage by increasing seleniu m available One laboratory study showed that selenium-treated anim als can remain unaffected, despite an accumulation of mercury in tissues to levels that are otherwise associat ed with toxic effects (Skerfving 1978). Support for the proposal that an inert complex is formed comes from th e 1:1 ratio of selenium and mercury found in the livers of marine mammals and in the bodies of experimental animals administered compounds of mercury andcompounds of selenium, regardless of the ratio of the injected doses (Hansen 1988). Southworth et al. (1994) evaluated the elimination of slurried fly ash discharges into a water-filled quarry and found that the discharge was followed by a steady increase in concentrations of mercury in the axial muscle of resident largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides) , increasing from 0.02 to 0.17 \u00b5g/g in a period of just 3 years. These authors also found that while selen ium concentrations in the quarry decreased from 25 to <2 \u00b5g/L during the same period, selenium concentrati ons in bass remained at about 3 times the background levels. Southworth and his co-author s concluded that the results of their study suggest that selenium may also be effective at blocking the accumulation of me thylmercury in harder, more alkaline waters. SPECIFIC ADVERSE EFFECTS ATTRIBUTABLE TO MERCURY EXPOSURE Death. Inhalation of sufficiently high concentrations of metallic and organic mercury vapors, ingestion of sufficiently high doses of organic and inor ganic mercury, and exposure to dialkyl mercurials by any route can be fatal to humans and animals. In the cases of both inhalation and dermal exposure to dialkyl-organomercurials (e.g., diethyl- and dimethyl mercury), acute exposures that appear innocuous or unremarkable at the time of exposure can result in death following a delay period of weeks or months. The tragic case of a delayed neurotoxicity and ultimat ely fatal poisoning 9 months after an acute dermal MERCURY 263 2. HEALTH EFFECTS exposure to only a few drops of dimethylmercury is st riking example of the danger of these forms of organic mercury (Blayney et al. 1997; Nierenberg et al. 1998). At least 5 other deaths have been reported due to alkyl mercury exposure since its first synthesis in the mi d-19th century (Toribara et al. 1997). These accidental poisoning cases also reveal a latency period of some months between the exposure and the onset of symptoms. In such cases, irreversible brain damage has already occurred by the time the first symptoms appeared. No information was located regarding specific concentrations of elemental mercury vapor that may be lethal; however, lethal exposures have generally occurred as a result of exposure under cond itions in which exposure levels are likely to be quite high (e.g., heating meta llic mercury in a closed space). Death in these cases has generally been attributed to respiratory failure (Campbell 1948; Kanluen and Gottlieb 1991; Matthes et 1992; Teng and Brennan 1959; Tennant et al. 1961). Deaths resulting from inhalation exposure to organic mercury compounds have also been reported (Brown 1954; Hill 1943; Hook et al. 1954; Lundgren and Swen sson 1949). Although the cause of death following inhalation of organic mercury was not reported, severe neurological dysfunction was observed prior to death. Lethal doses for acute oral exposure to inorganic merc ury have been estimated to be 29-50 mg Hg/kg (Troen et al. 1951). Deaths resulting from oral exposure to inor ganic mercury have been attributed to renal failure, cardiovascular collapse, and severe g astrointestinal damage (Gleason et al. 1957; Kang-Yum and Oransky 1992; et al. 1951). Deaths from consumption of methylmercury-contamin ated foods are well documented in outbreaks in Japan and Iraq, and lethal doses of 10-60 mg Hg/kg have been estimated from tissue concentrations (Bakir et al. 1973; Tsubaki and Takahashi 1986). Fataliti es were attributed to central nervous system toxicity (Bakir et al. 1973; Tamashiro et al. 1984). Pneumonia and nonischemic heart disease were prominent secondary causes ofdeath in the Japan epidemic (Tamashiro et al. 1984). Case reports of deaths associated solely with dermal mercury exposure to inorganic mercury are limited to a woman who died after inserting a mercuric chloride tablet into her vagina (Millar 1916) and a man who died after a 2-month treatment with a topical medicine containing mercurous chloride (Kang-Yum and Oransky 1992). Death was attributed to renal failure in one of these cases (Kang-Yum and Oransky 1992), and severe rena l damage was noted at the autopsy in the other (Millar 1916).MERCURY 264 2. HEALTH EFFECTS Animal data support the findings from human studies a nd provide somewhat more information regarding lethal exposure levels. Deaths associated with acute -duration inhalation exposur e to metallic mercury vapor have been observed in rats and rabbits at about 27-29 mg/m3 (Ashe et al. 1953; Livardjani et al. 1991b). Severe pulmonary edema has been reported as the cause of death following such exposures (Christensen et al. 1937). Severe ataxia occurred prior to death in rats exposed to methylmercury iodide vapor for intermediate durations (Hunter et al. 1940). Acute oral LD50 values for inorganic mercury ranged from 25.9 to 77.7 mg Hg/kg, with the most sensitive LD50 for 2-week-old rats (Kostial et al. 1978). Increased mortality in chronic-duration oral studies has been observed at 1.9 mg Hg/kg in male rats gavaged 5 days a week (NTP 1993). Early deaths were attributed to renal toxic ity. Oral exposure to methylmercuric compounds has resulted in increased mortality at 16 mg Hg/kg (single dose) (Yasutake et al. 1991b), 3.1 mg Hg/kg/day for26 weeks (Mitsumori et al. 1981), and 0.69 mg Hg/kg/day for up to 2 years (Mitsumori et al. 1990). Systemic Effects Respiratory Effects. The evidence from case report studies suggests that inhalation of metallic mercury vapor may result in clinical respiratory symptoms (e.g ., chest pains, dyspnea, cough, reduced vital capacity) (Bluhm et al. 1992a; Gore and Harding 1987; Ha 1992; Teng and Brennan 1959; Tennant et al. 1961). In the more severe cases, respiratory distress, pulmonary edema, lobar pneumonia, fibrosis, desquamation of the bronchiolar epithelium, and death due to respiratory failure have been observed (Campbell 1948; Gore and Hard ing 1987; Jaffe et al. 1983; Kanluen and Gottlieb 1991; Matthes 1959; Tennant et al. 1961). Acute- and intermediate-duration studies in rabbits appear to corroborate clinical symptoms observed in humans following inhalation exposure to metallic mercury va pors. Mild-to-moderate pathological changes (unspecified) were exhibited in the lungs of rabbits exposed to 6-28.8 mg/m 3 mercury vapor for up to 11 weeks (Ashe et al. 1953), and death due to asphyxi ation has been observed in rats exposed to 27 mg/m3 for 2 hours (Livardjani et al. 1991b). Lung c ongestion was observed after 100 hours of continuous exposure of rats to 1 mg/m3 (Gage 1961). The potential for oral exposure was not quantified; however, it is likely that most of the exposure was through inhala tion. Inconclusive evidence is available regarding respiratory effects due to inhalation of organic merc ury (Brown 1954; Hunter et al. 1940), and there is no conclusive evidence indicating that oral or dermal e xposure to inorganic or organic forms of mercury is MERCURY 265 2. HEALTH EFFECTS directly toxic to the respiratory system. Based on th ese results, it would appear that acute inhalation exposure of humans to high levels of metallic mercury may result in pulmonary effects. Cardiovascular Effects. The evidence from clinical, occupationa l, and general population studies suggests that inhalation of metallic mercury may affect the car diovascular system in humans, producing elevations in blood pressure and/or heart rate (Aronow et al. 1990; Bluhm al. 1992; Taueg Teng and Brennan 1959). Studies of workers chr onically exposed to elemental mercury vapor have shown increased incidences of palpitations (Piikivi 1989) , high incidences of hypertension (Vroom and Greer 1972), and increased likelihood of death due to ischemic heart and cerebrovascular disease (Barregard et al. 1990). Of particular interest is the study showing slightly higher blood pressure in persons with dental amalgams than in those with no mercury-containing am algams (Siblerud 1990). Less information is available regarding inhalation of organic me rcury, but one study showed elevated blood pressure in two men occupationally exposed to methylmercury compounds (Hook et al. 1954). Electrocardiographic abnormalities (ventricular ectopic beats, prolongation of the Q-T in terval, S-T segment depression, and T-wave inversion) were reported in persons who ate f oods contaminated with ethylmercury compounds or who ingested a large dose of mercuric (Chugh Cinca et al. 1979; and Abbasi 1961). It is unclear whether these electrocardiographic abnormalities were the result of direct cardiac toxicity or whether they weresecondary to other toxicity. A number of the above cases of mercury-related tachycar dia and elevated blood pressure in children inhaling metallic mercury vapors (Aronow et al. 1990; al. 1991) are associated with acrodynia, a nonallergic hyper sensitive reaction in children to mercury exposure. Similar elevations in heart rate and blood pressure have been reported in children ingesting mercurous chloride (calomel)-containing ammoniated mercury- containing ointments or diapers that had been rinsed in a mercuric chloride-containing solution (Warkany and Hubbard 1953). Limited animal data are available regarding inhalation exposure to mercury, but studies indicate that mercury may have a toxic effect on the heart. Effects rangi ng from mild pathological changes to marked cellular degeneration of heart tissue were exhi bited in rabbits inhaling 0.86-28.8 mg/m 3 mercury vapor for MERCURY 266 2. HEALTH EFFECTS acute and intermediate durations (Ashe et al. 1953). However, it is unclear whether these changes represent direct toxic effects on the heart or whether they were secondary to shock. The bulk of information available regarding cardiovascula r effects after oral exposure of animals to mercury generally supports findings seen in human inhalation st udies. Oral administration of 7 mg Hg/kg/day as inorganic mercury (mercuric chloride) for a year or 0.4 mg Hg/kg/day as organic mercury (methylmercuricchloride) for up to 28 days in rats resulted in elev ated blood pressure (Carmignani et al. 1989; Wakita 1987). At higher concentrations (28 mg Hg/kg/day as mercuric chloride for 180 days), decreases in cardiaccontractility were observed; these effects were suggested to be due to direct myocardial toxicity (Carmignani et al. 1992). Biphasic effects on myocardial tissue have been demonstrated on isolated papillary musclesfrom rat ventricles (Oliveira and Vassallo 1992). At lo w mercury concentrations, an increase in contractile force was observed, whereas at 5-10-fold higher concen trations dose-related decreases in contractile force were observed. The increases in contractile force were suggested to be due to inhibition of Na+-K+-ATPase, and the decreases were suggested to be due to inhi bition of Ca2+-ATPase of the sarcoplasmic reticulum. Based on these results, it would appear that children with hypersensitivity to mercury may exhibit tachycardia and elevated blood pressure following inhalation, oral , or dermal exposure to mercury or to mercury- containing compounds. In addition, low-level exposure to mercury for extended periods may cause elevated blood pressure in exposed populations. Chronic-durati on inhalation exposures or in termediate-duration oral exposures may also be associated with increased morta lity due to ischemic heart or cerebrovascular disease; however, the data supporting this conclusion are more limited. Gastrointestinal Effects. Both inhalation and oral exposures to me rcury have resulted in gastrointestinal toxicity. Mercurial stomatitis (inflammation of the oral mucosa, occasionally accompanied by excessivesalivation) is a classic symptom of mercury toxicity and has been observed following inhalation exposure to both inorganic and organic mercury (Bluhm et al. 1981; al. 1961; Vroom and Greer 1972). Mercuric chloride is caustic to the tissues of the gast rointestinal tract, and persons who have ingested large amounts of this form of mercury have exhibited blis ters, ulceration, and hemorrhages et al. 1978; Murphy et al. 1979; Samuels et al. MERCURY 267 2. HEALTH EFFECTS 1982). In some cases, gastrointestinal lesions have been observed after inhalation exposure to high concentrations of metallic mercury vapors. The aut opsy of a young child who i nhaled metallic mercury vapor revealed necrosis in the mucosa of the stomach and duodenum (Campbell 1948). Irritation of the oral mucosahas also been observed at the site of contact with dental amalgams that contain mercury (Veien 1990). However, this type of response appears to be a combination of stomatitis and a contact dermatitis. Symptoms of abdominal cramps, diarrhea, and nausea have been reported following acute- and/or intermediate-duration inhalation, oral, and dermal e xposures to ury (Afonso 1960; 1959; Tennant et al. 1961; Warkany and Hubbard 1953). Rabbits displayed mild pathological changes to marked cellular degeneration and some necrosis in the colon tissue after inhaling 28.8 mg/m 3 mercury for 4-30 hours (Ashe et al. 1953). Inflammation and necrosis of the glandular stomach were observed in mice given 59 mg Hg /kg as mercuric chloride by gavage 5 days a week for 2 weeks (NTP 1993). An increased incidence of fo restomach hyperplasia was observed in male rats exposed to 1.9 mg Hg/kg/day as mercuric chloride fo r 2 years (NTP 1993). Necrosis and ulceration of the cecum have been observed in rats after chronic-dura tion exposure to 4.2 mg Hg/kg/day as phenylmercuric acetate in the drinking water (Fitzhugh et al. 1950; Solecki et al. 1991). Ulceration of the glandular stomachwas observed in mice after 2 years of exposure to methyl mercuric chloride (0.86 mg Hg/kg/day) in the diet. Acute-duration inhalation exposure or chronic-duration oral exposure to inorganic and organic mercury may, therefore, result in various gastrointestinal symptoms in humans, with possible damage to intestinal tissues. Hematological Effects. Leukocytosis associated with a metal fume fever-like syndrome has been observed in persons exposed to high concentrations of me tallic mercury vapor (Cam pbell 1948; Matthes et al. 1958; Rowens et al. 1991). It is probable that this effect is specific to inhalation exposure to mercury. Because of the high concentrations of mercury that have b een involved in the studies reviewed, it is unlikely that persons exposed to mercury vapors at hazardous w aste sites would be exposed to sufficiently high concentrations of mercury to result in leukocytosis. Other hematological effects associated with exposure to mercury include decreased hemoglobin and hematocrit in persons with dental amalgams (Siblerud 1990) MERCURY 268 2. HEALTH EFFECTS and decreased -aminolevulinic acid dehydratase activity in erythrocytes or increased serum proteins involved in the storage and transport of copper in workers expo sed to mercury vapor (Bencko et al. 1990; Wada et al. 1969). Anemia was found in a man who ingested a lethal amount of mercuric chloride (Murphy et al. 1979). However, the anemia was most likely the result of m assive gastrointestinal hemorrhaging. No reports of effects on blood parameters in humans were located after oral exposure to organic mercury. A decrease in red cell count, hemoglobin, and hematocrit and rupture of erythrocytes were observed after intraperitoneal injection of mice with 19.2 mg Hg/kg as methylmercuric chloride (Shaw et al. 1991). A decrease inhemoglobin, hematocrit, and red blood cell count was ob served in rats that received phenylmercuric acetate in their drinking water for 2 years (Solecki et al. 1991). However, this effect was probably due to blood loss associated with intestinal ulcers. Thus, there is lim ited information that suggests that prolonged exposure of humans to high levels of mercury, possibly from living in the vicinity of hazardous waste sites, may result inhematological changes. Musculoskeletal Effects. Increases in tremors, muscle fasciculations, myoclonus, or muscle pains have been reported in persons exposed to unspecified concentra tions of elemental mercury vapor (Adams et al. 1983; Albers et al. 1982, 1988; Aronow et et al. 1992; Verberk et al. 1986; Vroom and Greer 1972; Williamson et al. 1982), in individuals inhaling al kyl mercury compounds (Brown 1954; Hook et al. 1954; Hunter et al. 1940), and in persons ingesting mercur ous chloride (Warkany and Hubbard 1953) or ethyl- mercury compounds (Jalili and Abbasi 1961). These muscu lar effects are probably the result of peripheral nervous system dysfunction. It is probable that pe rsons exposed to sufficiently high concentrations of mercury in the air or in foodstuffs (e.g., contaminat ed fish) at hazardous waste sites may also experience symptoms of tremors, myoclonus, muscle fasciculations, or muscle pains. A single report was identified thatfound evidence of rhabdomyolysis (destruction of the sk eletal muscle) in a 22-year-old man who attempted suicide by ingesting 2 g of mercuric chloride (Chugh et al. 1978). It is extremely unlikely that persons at hazardous waste sites would be exposed to simila rly high concentrations of mercuric decreased sy nthesis of hepatic coagulation factors, were reported in a case study of a child who inhaled an uns pecified concentration of metallic mercury vapor (Jaffe et al. 1983). Similarly, hepatomegaly and he patocellular vacuolation were observed in a man who MERCURY 269 2. HEALTH EFFECTS died following acute-duration, high-level exposure to elemental mercury vapor (Kanluen and Gottlieb 1991; Rowens et al. 1991). A lethal oral dose of mercuric chloride in a 35-year-old man also resulted in jaundice, Inhalation of 6-28.8 mg/m3 mercury vapor for 6 hours to 11 weeks by rabbits produced effects ranging from mild pathological changes to severe necrosis in the liver, including necrosis and degeneration; effects were less severe at the shorter durations (Ashe et al. 1953). Intermediate-duration oral exposure to inorganic mercury has also been associated with increases in hepatic lipid per oxidation (Rana and Boora alkaline phosphatase (Jonker et al. 1993a). It is unc lear to what extent these effects were due to the direct toxic effects of mercury on the liver or were secondary to shock in the exposed animals. Reliable information regarding hepatic effects following orga nic mercury exposure was not located. These limited data suggest the potential hepatic toxi city of short-term inhalation of hi gh concentrations of mercury vapor to humans. It is unlikely that persons at hazardous waste sites would ingest sufficiently large amounts of mercuric chloride to cause hepatic toxicity. Renal Effects. The kidney is one of the major target or gans of mercury-induced toxicity. Adverse renal effects have been reporte d following exposure to metallic, inorganic, and organic forms of mercury in both humans and experimental animals. The nephrotic syndrome in humans associated with the ingestion, inhalation, or dermal app lication of mercury is primarily identified as an increase in excretion of urinary protein, although depending on the severity of the renal toxicity, hematuria, oliguria, urinary casts, edema, inability to concentrate the urine, and hypercholesterolemia may also be observed (Agner and 1992; Stewart et al. 1977; Tubbs et al. 1982). These effectsare usually reversible. However, in the most severe cases, acute renal failure has been observed (Afonso and deAlvarez 1960; Davis et al. 1974; Jaffe et and Oransky 1992; Murphy et al. 1979; Samuels et al. 1982). Renal biopsies and/or autopsy results have primarilyMERCURY 270 2. HEALTH EFFECTS Rowens et al. 1991), but glomerular changes have also been reported (Kazantzis et al. 1962; Tubbs et al. 1982). Although the primary effect of mercury on the kidneys app ears to be a direct toxic effect on the renal tubules, there is also evidence that implicates an immune mechanism of action for mercury-induced glomerular toxicity in some persons. In support of this theo ry, a few human case studies have reported deposition of IgG, immune complexes, and/or complement C3 along the glomerular basement membrane (Lindqvist et al. 1974;Tubbs et al. 1982). Studies in animals support the conclusion that the primar y toxic effect of both inorganic and organic mercury in the kidneys is on the epithelial cells of the rena l proximal tubules. The changes observed in these studies were comparable with those observed in humans (i.e., proteinuria, oliguria, increases in urinary excretion of tubular enzymes, proteinaceous casts, decreased ability to concentrate the urine, decreased phenolsulfonphthalein excretion, increased plasma creatinine) (Bernard et al. 1992; Chan et al. 1992; Dieter et al. 1992; Girardi and Elias 1991; Jonker et al. 1993a; al. 1991; NTP 1993; Yasutake et al. 1991b). In addition, the animal studies provided detailed information regarding the histopathological changes occurring in the kidneys (Carmignani et al. 1989, 1992; Chan et al. 1992; Dieter etal. 1992; Falk 1974; et 1972; Magos et al. Yasutake et al. 1991b). The progressi on of renal toxicity in cluded initial degenerative changes in the epithelial cells of the proximal t ubules (nuclear swelling, increased eosinophilia/basophilia, vacuolization, and cellular hypertrophy). In the ear ly stages, these degenerative changes were accompanied by tubular regeneration. Occasionally, when there is minor toxic damage, only the regenerative changes were observed. As the lesions progressed, tubular dilation, desquamation of the epithe lial cells, and thickening of the tubular basement membrane were observed. Fibros is, inflammation, necrosis, and atrophy of the tubules and glomerular changes (i.e., hypercellularity, thicke ning of the glomerular basement membrane) were then observed. Several investigators have suggested that the renal toxi city exhibited after administration of organic forms of mercury (e.g., methylmercury) may actually result from the in vivo metabolism of this form to inorganic mercury (Fowler 1972; Klein et al. 1973; Magos et al. 1985). This hypothesis is supported by the increase in the smooth endoplasmic reticulum, a potential site for this metabolic conversion, and the measurement ofMERCURY 271 2. HEALTH EFFECTS substantial levels of inorganic mercury in the ki dneys following exposure to methylmercury (Fowler 1972; Klein et al. 1973). In New Zealand White rabbits and in certain strain s of mice and rats, a membranous glomerulonephropathy was the predominant finding in the absence of significan t tubular damage. This syndrome was characterized by proteinuria, deposition of immune material (i.e., IgG and complement C3) in the renal mesangium and glomerular blood vessels, and minimal glomerular cell hyperplasia (Aten et 1992; Roman-Franco et al. 1978; van der Meide et al. 1993). Deposition of antiglomerular basement membrane antibodies has been observed in a susceptible strain of rat at subcutaneous doses of mercuric chloride as low as 0.15 mg Hg/kg 4 days a week for 2 weeks (Michaelson et al. 1985). Increases in urinary protein were not observed until 0.74 mg Hg/kg 4 days a week for 2 weeks. In mice, autoantibodies toglomerular basement membrane were not observed, but deposition of IgG in the kidneys occurs as a result of autoantibodies to nucleolar antigens (Hultman and En estrom 1988). The immune basis for these responses is covered in the section on immunological effects below. The susceptibility to this form of renal toxicity appears to be governed by both MHC genes and nonMHC genes (Aten et al. 1991; Sapin et al. 1984). Among rat strains, Brown-Norway, MAXX, and DZB strains showed susceptibility to renal damage, whereas Lewis, M520, and AO rats did not (Aten et al. 1991; Drue t et al. 1978; Michaelson et al. 1985). Among mouse strains, SJL/N mice are susceptible to renal toxi city, whereas DBA, C57BL, and Balb/c mice are not (Hultman and Enestrom 1992; Hultman et al. 1992). The apparent genetic basis for susceptibility to mercury- induced nephrotoxicity in experimental animals has important implications with regard to susceptible subpopulations of humans. Based on the above information, it is likely that pe rsons exposed to sufficiently high concentrations of mercury may experience renal tubular toxicity. Cert ain persons who are genetically predisposed may also develop an immunologically based membranous glomerulonephritis. Dermal Effects. Dermal reactions have been observed in persons exposed to inorganic and organic mercury following inhalation, oral, and/or dermal exposures. The predominant skin reaction is erythematous and pruritic skin rashes al. HEALTH EFFECTS Tunnessen et al. 1987; Veien 1990; Warkany and Hubbard 1953). In many of the dermal cases, a contact dermatitis type of response was observed. However, a nonallergic pruritus is characteristic of acrodynia, a hypersensitive reaction to mercury exposure observed pr imarily in children, and several of the above cases may have been attributable to this syndrome (Aronow et al. 1990; Engleson 1987; Hubbard 1953). Other reactions characteristic of incl ude al. 1976; Warkany and Hubbard 1953) and itching, reddened, swollen and/or peeling skin on the palms of the hands and soles of the feet (Aronow et al. al. 1987; Warkany and Hubbard 1953). No animal studies were located to support th ese findings. However, these results demonstrate that two populations may experience dermal effects as a resu lt of mercury exposure. One is those persons who develop an allergic reaction to mercury. The othe r is those who are hypersensitive to mercury and who develop acrodynia upon exposure. It is unknown whethe r sufficiently high concentrations of inorganic mercury in soil or methylmercury in fish may exist at hazardous waste sites to trigger allergic dermatitis in sensitive persons or acrodynia in those predisposed to develop this syndrome. Ocular Effects. Ocular effects have been observed in pers ons exposed to high concentrations of metallic mercury vapors. These effects are probably due to direct contact of the mercury vapor with the eyes. Theobserved effects include red and burning eyes, conj unctivitis (Bluhm et al. 1992a; Foulds et al. 1991; Schwartz et al. 1992; Sexton et al. 1976), and a yellow haze on the lenses of the eye(Atkinson 1943; Bidstrup et al. 1951; Locket and Nazroo 1952). The yellow haze was associated with long-term occupational exposures. Animal studies were not available to support these findings. However, the evidence suggests that exposure to high levels of mercury vapor may result in ocular irritation. Other Systemic Effects. Studies of workers exposed to mercury vapor found no effect on serum levels of thyroid-stimulating hormone (Erfurth et al. 1990; Mc Gregor and Mason 1991). However, an enlarged thyroid, with elevated triiodothyronine and thyr oxine, as well as reduced thyroid-stimulating hormone developed in a 13-year-old boy exposed to mercury vapor for 2 weeks (Karpathios et al. 1991). Animal studies generally support an effect of acute-duration high-level exposure on the thyroid, although the results have been somewhat variable (Goldman and Blac kburn 1979; Sin and The 1992; Sin et al. 1990). A single intramuscular injection of 14.8 mg Hg/kg in rabbits resulted in increased thyroid peroxidase and triiodo- thyronine and decreased thyroxine (Ghosh and Bhattach arya 1992). A study in which rats received three MERCURY 273 2. HEALTH EFFECTS daily subcutaneous doses of methylmercuric chloride showed slight increases in thyroid weight and basal levels of thyroid-stimulating horm one and thyroxine (Kabuto 1991). Ho wever, it was unclear whether these changes were statistically significant. In contrast , a single subcutaneous dose of 6.4 mg/Hg as methyl- chloride resulted in significant decreases in serum thyroxine (Kabuto 1987). At higher doses(9.6 and 12.8 mg mercury), increases in prolactin and thyroid-stimulating hormone were observed. The reason for these differences is unclear, but the data sugg est that thyroid function may be affected if persons are exposed to sufficiently high concentrations of mercury. Animal studies also provide evidence of mercury-indu ced effects on the corticosteroid levels. Increased adrenal and plasma corticosterone levels were reported in rats r eceiving 2.6 mg Hg/kg/day as mercuric chloride in drinking water after 120 days (Agrawal and Chansouria 1989). At 180 days of exposure, these effects were not evident in the animals. The investig ators suggested that mercuric chloride is chemical stressor. Subchronic administration of methylmercury to rats caused a diminished secretory response of corticosterone and t estosterone adrenal glands showed marked hyperplasia and incr eased weight, and basal levels of these hormones were also depressed. The treated animals exhibited stress intolerance and decreased sexual activity. These results suggest that methylmercury may have an adverse effect on steroidogenesis in the adrenal cortex and testes. Based on these animal studies, inorganic and organic mercury may also act on the corticosteroid system toalter hormonal levels. It is unclear to what extent the effects observed are the result of generalized stress or direct toxic effects on the endocrine sy stem regulating corticosteroid levels. Inhalation of metallic mercury vapor may result in a me tal fume fever-like syndrome characterized by fatigue, fever, chills, cough, and an elevated leukocyte count (B luhm et al. 1992a; Garnier al. 1970; Schwartz et al. 1992; Snodgrass et al. 1981). Also, children with acrodynia frequently low-grade in termittent fevers (Aronow et al. 1990; Warkany and Hubbard 1953). Animal data are not available to s upport this finding, but the human data suggest that exposure to sufficiently high concentrations of meta llic mercury vapor may result in transient fever (see Hematological Effects). Immunological Effects. As indicated in the section on dermal effects, allergic dermatological reactions occurred in persons exposed to inorganic mercury fro m dental amalgams, tattoos, or breakage of medical instruments (Anneroth et al. 1992; Bagley et al. 1987; Biro and Klein 1967; Veien 1990). Additionally, mercury may cause either decreases in immune activity or an autoimmune response, depending on the genetic predisposition of the individual exposed. The human data are very limited, and only decreased IgG production has been observed in workers chronically expo sed to metallic mercury vapor at chloralkali and ore production plants (Bencko et al. 1990; Moszczynski et al. 1990b). Neither of these studies, however, adjustedfor smoking or alcohol. Increases in serum immunoglobulin s (IgA, IgG, IgE, or IgM) and autoantibody titres (antilaminin or antiglomerular basement membrane anti bodies) have not been observed in similarly exposed populations (Bernard et al. 1987; Cardenas et al. 1993; Langworth et al. 1992b). There is limited information in humans that suggests that certain individuals ma y develop an autoimmune response when exposed to mercury. Deposition of IgG and complement C3 have been observed in the glomeruli of two workers with mercury-induced proteinuria (Tubbs et al. 1982). Also, increased antiglomerular basement membrane antibodies and elevated antinuclear antibodies have been observed in a few persons with exposure to mercury in dental amalgams (Anneroth et al. 1992). After re moval of one dental amalgam, a significant decrease in IgE levels was observed. Within the populations d escribed above that showed no overall increase in immune parameters, individuals in these gr oups showed either increases in anti- DNA antibody titres or antiglomerular basement membrane responses (Cardenas et al. 1993; Langworth et al. 1992b). Moszczynski et al. (1995)studied workers exposed to mercury vapor and reporte d a positive correlation between the T-helper cell count and the duration of exposure. The combined stimula tion of the T-cell line and an observed decrease in the helper/suppressor ratio were suggestive of an autoimmune response. The immune system reaction to mercury has been ex tensively studied in animals. Although it has not been completely described, a great deal of informati on exists about the changes that occur in the immune system in response to mercury exposure (Bigazzi 1992; Goldman et al. 1991; Mathieson 1992). Animal strains that are susceptible or predispo sed to develop an autoimmune response show a proliferation of autoreactive T-cells (specifically CD 4+ T-cells) (Pelletier et al. 1986; Rossert et al. 1988). The fundamental change caused by mercury that results in the autoimmune response appears to be in these autoreactive T-cells, since transfer of these cells to an unexposed animal results in the development of the autoimmune response in the unexposed animal (Pelletier et al. 1988). A subset of the CD4+ T-cells, the Th2 cells, are activated and induce polyclonal B-cell activ ation (possibly through the release of interleukin-4 [IL-4]), which results in IgE production by the B-cells (Ochel et al. 1991). The increases in serum IgE areparalleled by increases in MHC molecule expression on th e B-cells (Dubey et al. 1991a). These changes are accompanied by enlargement of the spleen and lym ph nodes, an increase in the number of spleen cells MERCURY 275 2. HEALTH EFFECTS (thought to be associated with the B-cell proliferati on) (Hirsch et al. 1982; Matsuo et al. 1989), and marked increases in serum levels of IgE (Dubey et al. 1991b; Hirsch et al. 1986; Lymberi et al. 1986; Prouvost-Danonet al. 1981). Increases in the production of autoantibodies (IgG) to glomerular basement membrane,thyroglobulin, collagen types I and II, and DNA also occur (Pusey et al. 1990). Immune complex depositsoccur in blood vessels in several organs (Hultman et al. 1992), and deposition of these autoantibodies and complement in the renal glomerulus ultimately l ead to membranous glomerulonephropathy, although the deposition of the IgG alone does not appear to be suffi cient to induce renal dysfunction (Michaelson et al. 1985). In rodents, the autoimmune response spontane ously resolves within a few weeks. The mechanism underlying the resolution is unknown, but antiidiotypic an tibodies and a change in the balance between Th2 and Th1 (another subset of the CD4+ T-cells) cell ac tivation (see below) have been proposed (Mathieson 1992). After this resolution phase has occurred, aff ected individuals develop a resistance to future autoimmune toxicity (Bowman et al. 1984). The resist ance appears to be mediated by CD8+ T-cells, since depletion of these cells reverses the resistance (Mathieson et al. 1991). The so-called resistant strains, however, show a diffe rent response to mercury exposure. These resistant strains also show an increase in MHC expression molecu les on B-cells, but this response is extremely short- lived, and increases in serum IgE were not observed (Dubey et al. 1991a; Prouvost-Danon et al. 1981). The difference in the responses of the so-called resistant and susceptible strains may be found in the activation of Th1 cells and the increase in secretion of -interferon by the Th1 cells of resistant animals (van der Meide et al. 1993). The susceptible strains do not show an increase in -interferon production w ith mercury exposure. Because -interferon inhibits the proliferation of Th2 ce lls, the absence of this response in the susceptible strains may allow the Th2 cell-stimulated production of autoantibodies to occur, whereas in the resistant strains the production of antibodies is curtailed. Thus , differences in the activation of Th1 versus Th2 cells may underlie the differences in susceptibility of various i ndividuals. Studies using in-bred strains of mice and rats have determined that the susceptibility to the diffe rent immune reactions is governed by both MHC genes as well as other genes (Aten et al. 1991; Druet et al. 1977; Mirtcheva et al. 1989; Sapin et al. 1984). Asindicated in the section on renal effects, Brown-No rway, MAXX, and DZB rat strains showed susceptibility, whereas Lewis, M520, and AO rats did not (Aten et al. 1991; Druet et al. 1978; Michaelson et al. 1985). Among mouse strains, SJL/N mice are susceptible and DB A, C57BL, and Balb/c mice are not (Hultman and Enestrom 1992; Hultman et al. 1992). In a resistant strain, the Balb/c mouse, immune suppression wasmanifested as decreased natural killer cell activity in mi ce administered a diet containing 0.5 mg Hg/kg/day as methylmercury (Ilback 1991). MERCURY 276 2. HEALTH EFFECTS Neurological Effects. The nervous system is the primary target organ for elemental and methyl- mercury-induced toxicity. Neurological and behavior al disorders in humans have been observed following inhalation of metallic mercury vapor and organic mercury compounds, ing estion or dermal application of inorganic mercury-containing medicinal products (e.g ., teething powders, ointments, and laxatives), and ingestion or dermal exposure to organic mercury-c ontaining pesticides or ingestion of contaminated seafood. A broad range of symptoms has been reported, and these symptoms are qualitatively similar,irrespective of the mercury compound to which one is exposed. Specific neurotoxic symptoms include tremors (initially affecting the hands and sometimes spr eading to other parts of the body), emotional lability (characterized by irritability, excessive shyness, conf idence loss, and nervousness), insomnia, memory loss, neuromuscular changes (weakness, muscle atrophy, and muscle twitching), headaches, polyneuropathy (paresthesias, stocking-glove sensory loss, hyperac tive tendon reflexes, slowed sensory and motor nerve conduction velocities), and performance deficits in t ests of cognitive and motor function (Adams et al. 1983; Albers et al. 1982, 1988; Aronow et al. 1990; Ba kir et al. 1973; 1978; Bidstrup et al. 1951; Bluhm et Bourgeois et al. 1986; Chaffin et al. 1973; Chapman et al. 1990; Choi et al. 1978; Cinca et al. 1979; Davis et al. Iyer et al. al. al. 1976; Shapiro et al. 1982;Snodgrass et al. 1981; Smith et al. 1970; Tamashiro Greer 1972; Warkany and Hubbard 1953; Williamson et al. 1982). Some individuals have also noted hearing loss, vi sual disturbances (visual field defects), and/or hallucinations (Bluhm et al. 1978; Taueg et al. 1992). Although improvement has often been observed upon removal of persons from the s ource of exposure, it is possible that some changes may be irreversible. Autopsy findi ngs of degenerative changes in the brains of poisoned patients exposed to mercury support the functional changes observed (Al-Saleem and the Clinical Committee on Mercury Poisoning 1976; Cinca et al. 1979; Davis et al. 1974; Miyakawa et al. 1976). Limited information was located regarding exposure levels associated with th e above effects, but increased tremors and cognitive difficulties are sensitive end points for chronic low-leve l exposure to metallic mercury vapor (Fawer et al. MERCURY 277 2. HEALTH EFFECTS 1983; Ngim et al. 1992). Photophobia has been reported exclusively in children with acrodynia (Fagala and Wigg 1992; Warkany and Hubbard 1953). The physiological basis for the photophobia is unknown. The neurotoxicity of inorganic and organic mercury in experimental animals is manifested as functional, behavioral, and morphological changes, as well as alterati ons in brain and et al. 1972; itsumori et al. 1981; Miyama et al. 1983; Post et al. 1973; Rice 1989c; Rice and Gilbert 1982, 1992; Salvate al. 1973; Sharma et al. 1982; Tsuzuki 1981; Yip and Chang 1981). Animal studies have shown damage to the cerebellar cortex and dorsal root ganglion cells following methylmercuric chloride exposure (Chang and Hartmann 1972b). These structures appear to be especially sensitive to the toxic e ffects of mercury (Chang and Hartmann 1972a, 1972b; Chang et al. 1974; Charbonneau et Falk et al. 1974; 1986; 1985; Mitsumori et al. 1990; Yip and Chang 1981), although other areas (e.g ., the cerebral cortex, corpus striatum, thalamus, hypothalamus, organ of Corti, and peripheral nerves) have also shown degenerative changes after exposure to methylmercury (Berthoud et al. 1976; Chang et al. 1974; Charbonneau et al. 1976; Falk et al. 1974;Fehling et al. 1975; Jacobs et al. 1977; Miyakawa et al. 1974, 1976; Yip and Chang 1981). Cats and monkeys appear to be more sensitive to the toxic eff ects than rodents and have shown signs of neurotoxicity at approximately 10-fold lower doses (0.05 mg Hg/kg/ day) following long-term exposure to methylmercuric chloride (Charbonneau et al. 1976; Rice 1989c; Rice and Gilbert 1982, 1992). Although it is unclear whether changes in neurochemical parameters are primary targets of mercury or whether the changes are secondary to degenerative ch anges in neurons, several neurotransmitter systems have been shown to be affected by mercury exposure. Cholinergic transmission at the neuromuscular junction has been shown to be affected by mercur y exposure (Eldefrawi et al. 1977; Sager et al. 1982). Changes in GABA receptor activity and number have also been observed (Arakawa et al. 1991; Concas et al. 1983). Changes in the activities of enzymes involve d in cholinergic, adrenergic, dopaminergic, and MERCURY 278 2. HEALTH EFFECTS serotonergic synthesis and/or catabolism have also b een observed following mercury exposure (Sharma et al. 1982; Tsuzuki 1981). Collectively, the above information shows the high sensitiv ity of the nervous system to mercury toxicity and indicates that persons exposed to sufficiently high amounts of mercury may experience adverse neurological symptoms. Reproductive Effects. Studies in humans indicate that metallic mercury vapor does not cause infertility or malformations following paternal exposure (Alcser et al. 1989; Lauwerys et al. 1985) but may cause an increase in the rate of spontaneous abortions (Cordi er et al. 1991). No correlation was observed between levels of testosterone, luteiniz ing hormone, or follicle-stimulating hormone and occupational exposure to metallic mercury vapor, indicating that the pituitary control of testosterone secretion was not affected (Erfurth et al. 1990; McGregor and Mason 1991). However, in vitro studies have shown that mercury can adversely affect human spermatozoa. Inorganic (mer curic chloride) and organic (methylmercuric chloride) mercury decreased the percentage of motile spermatozoa in vitro (Ernst and Lauritsen 1991). Incubation of human spermatozoa with inorganic mercury resulted in mercury deposits localized in the membranes of the midpiece and tailpiece. The lack of mercury grains in spermatozoa with methylmercury exposure may bedue to the inability of spermatozoa or the semen pl asma to demethylate methylmercury in the 15-minute incubation period (Ernst and Lauritsen 1991). Female dentists and dental assistants exposed to metallic mercury vapors had increased reproductive failures (spontaneous abortions, stillbirths, and congenital malformations) and i rregular, painful, or hemorrhagic menstrual disorders (Sikorski et al. 1987). Correlations were observed between the incidence of these effects and hair mercury levels. Rowland et al. (1994) report that female dental assist ants with a high occupational exposure to mercury were found to be less fertile than controls. The probab ility of conception with each menstrual cycle (called \"fecundability\" by the authors) in women who prepar ed 30 or more amalgams per week and who were evaluated as having 4 or more poor mercury-hygiene pr actices was only 63% of that of unexposed controls. Hygiene was incorporated into the evaluation of the results of this study because occupational groups with roughly the same potential for exposure often contain subjects whose actual exposures are quite different, depending on their particular work environment and th eir work (and personal) hygiene practices within that environment. Rowland et al. (1994) found that 20% of the women in their final evaluation who preparedMERCURY 279 2. HEALTH EFFECTS more than 30 amalgams a week had 4 or more poor mercury-hygiene factors. Among women preparing a comparable number of amalgams, there were differe nces in \"fecundability,\" based on the number of self- reported poor hygiene factors. The study is limited in that a group of unexposed women had lower fertility than the low exposed group suggesting other unaccounted for exposures or confounding factors. Animal data suggest that mercury may alter repr oductive function and/or success when administered to either males or females. In males, mercury exposure results primarily in impaired spermatogenesis, sperm motility, and degeneration of seminiferous tubules. Or al administration of methylmercury to males has resulted in decreases in litter size due to preimplantati on loss (presumably due to defective sperm) in rats (Khera 1973), decreases in sperm motility in monkeys (at 0.025 mg Hg/kg/day for 20 weeks) (Mohamed etal. 1987), and tubular atrophy and decreased spermatogen esis in mice after prolonged exposure (Hirano et al. 1986; Mitsumori et al. 1990). Parenteral administrati on of methylmercury has shown similar results. A single intraperitoneal injection of 10 mg/kg of methylmercury in male mice resulted in decreasedimplantations in females (Suter 1975), and a single intraperitoneal injection of 1 mg/kg of methylmercuryresulted in a reversible failure of spermatogen esis and infertility in male mice (Lee and Dixon 1975). Repeated intraperitoneal injections of methylmercury (3 .5 mg Hg/kg/day for 6 weeks) in male rats resulted in decreased sexual activity, depression of testoster one levels (Burton and Meikle 1980), and decreased spermatogenesis (0.004 mg Hg/kg/day for 15-90 days) (Vachhrajani et al. 1992). Less is known about the effects of inorganic mercury on the male reproductive system, but a single intraperitoneal injection ofmercuric chloride (1 mg Hg/kg) in male rats r esulted in decreased conceptions in females (Lee and Dixon 1975), and 0.74 mg Hg/kg resulted in tubular degeneration (Prem et al. 1992). An in vitro study (Mohamed et al. 1987) suggested that the decrease in sperm motility observed in monkeys may be due to interference with microtubule assembly or dynein/microtubule sliding function. In females, mercury exposure results primarily in increases in resorptions and decreases in implantations. Inhalation exposure of female rats to metallic mercury vapor (2.5 mg/m 3, 6 hours a day, 5 days a week for 21 days) resulted in a prolongation of the estrous cycle (Baranski and Szymczyk 1973). Oraladministration of mercuric acetate (22 mg Hg/kg) to pregnant hamsters resulted in an increase in resorptions (Gale 1974). Oral administration of meth ylmercury to pregnant guinea pigs (11.5 mg Hg/kg) resulted in an increase in abortions (Inouye a nd Kajiwara 1988), and 3 mg Hg/kg resulted in a decrease in the number of pups in the litter from pre gnant mice (Hughes and Annau 1976). Pregnant mice given a single dose of 20 mg Hg/kg as methylmercuric chloride had increased resorptions, decreased live fetuses, and decreased fetuses per litter (Fuyuta et al. 1978). Repeated oral administration of methylmercury MERCURY 280 2. HEALTH EFFECTS (0.06 mg Hg/kg/day) to female monkeys resulted in an increase in the number of abortions and a decrease in conceptions (Burbacher et al. 1988). No effect on the monkeys' menstrual cycles was observed. Intraperitoneal administration of mercuric chloride (1.48 mg Hg/kg) to female mice resulted in decreases in litter size and number of litters/female and an increase in dead implants in some strains of mice, but these effects were strain-specific (Suter 1975). In female mice administered a single intraperitoneal dose of 1 mg Hg/kg as mercuric chloride, a decrease in mean impl antation sites was observed (Kajiwara and Inouye 1992). Subcutaneous injection of female hamsters with 6.2-8.2 mg Hg/kg as mercuric chloride for 1-4 (Lamperti and Prin tz 1973). Inhibition of follicular maturation uterine hypertrophy, morphological prolongation of the co rpora lutea, and alteration of progesterone levels were observed. Collectively, these results suggest that at sufficiently high mercury concentrations, men may experience some adverse effects on testicular func tion and women may experience increases in abortions, decreases in conceptions, or development of menstrual disorders. Developmental Effects. Mercury is considered to be a deve lopmental toxicant. Extremely limited information was located regarding human developmen tal effects associated with exposure to inorganic mercury (Alcser et al. and Baker 1988; Thorpe et al. 1992). However, developmental toxicity in humans associated with oral exposure to organic forms of mercury is well recognized (Amin-Zaki et al. 1974; Bakir et al. 1987; McKeown-Eyssen et al. 1983; Snyder and Seelinger 1976). The symptoms observed in offspring of exposed mothers are primarily neurological in origin and haveranged from delays in motor and verbal development to severe brain damage. Subtle changes, such as small changes in intelligence or learning capacity are currently being tested in populations with low-level, chronic exposure to mercury in the diet (Davidson et al. 1998; Grandjean et al. 1997b, 1998). MRLs for acute- and intermediate-duration exposure to methylmercury have been developed based on the lowest observed peak hair level in a mother whose child was reported to ha ve a delayed onset of walking (14 ppm in hair) (Cox et al. 1989; WHO 1990). Animal studies suggest that both inorganic mercury and organic mercury cause developmental toxicity. Metallic mercury vapor may be transferred across the placenta (Greenwood et al. 1972). The placental transport of mercury in pregnant mice and its loca lization in the embryo and fetus were studied by autoradiography and gamma counting (Kha yat and Dencker 1982). Retention of 203Hg vapor following inhalation was compared to intravenous injection of 203Hg as mercuric chloride. The authors reported that inhalation of mercury vapor resulted in a mercury concentration that was four times higher than theMERCURY 281 2. HEALTH EFFECTS concentration resulting from injection of mercuric chlo ride. Furthermore, the authors reported that metallic mercury appeared to oxidize to Hg+2 in the fetal tissues. Evidence that inhalation exposure may result in developmental toxicity comes from a study in which neonatal rats were exposed to metallic mercury vapor during a period of rapid brain development (this occurs postnatally in rodents but prenatally in humans), resulting in impaired spatial learning (Fredriksson et al. 1992). Oral administration of inorganic mercury salts to pregnant hamsters has been observed to pr oduce an increase in the number of resorptions and small and edematous embryos (Gale 1974). Mercury-induced embryotoxicity in one non-inbred and five inbred stains of female hamsters was investigated by Gale and Ferm (1971). A single subcutaneous injection of 9.5 mg Hg/kg as mercuric acetate to dams on Gd 8 produced a variety of malformations, including cleftpalate, hydrocephalus, and heart defects, and sta tistically significant interstrain differences in the embryotoxic response. Single doses of 1.3-2.5 mg Hg/kg as mercuric acetate injected intravenously intopregnant hamsters on Gd 8 produced growth retardation and edema of the fetuses at all 3 dose levels, while an increase in the number of abnormalities was detected at the two higher doses (Gale and Ferm 1971). Therelative effectiveness of different exposure routes in ha msters was compared by Gale (1974). The following sequence of decreasing efficacy was noted for mercur ic acetate: intraperitoneal > intravenous > subcutaneous > oral. The lowest doses used (2 mg/kg for intraperitoneal and 4 mg/kg for the other 3 routes) were all effective in causing increased resorption and an increased percentage of abnormalities. Intravenous injection of 1.5 mg Hg/kg/day as mercuric chloride also resulted in a significant increase in the number of abnormal preimplantation embryos (Kajiwara and Inouye 1986). In animals, embryolethal, anatomical, and behavioral effects have been reported following oral exposure of pregnant dams to methylmercury (Bornhausen et al . 1980; Guidetti et 1991; Inouye and Kajiwara Stoltenburg-Didinger a nd Markwort 1990; Yasuda et al. 1985). Thus far, the most sensitive animal assay for developmental ne urotoxicity has been a behavioral paradigm that examined the number of rewarded responses to differen tial reinforcement at high rates (Bornhausen et al. 1980). At doses of 0.008 mg Hg/kg/day and above, a dose-related decrease in rewarded responses was observed in 4-month-old offspring of rats treated on Gd 6-9. The effect was more pronounced in male offspring than females. Foster mothers were used to preclude consumption of contaminated milk during lactation.MERCURY 282 2. HEALTH EFFECTS Developmental toxicity has also been observed with pa renteral exposure to methylmercury in pregnant dams during gestation. In mice given methylmercuric hy droxide subcutaneously daily from Gd 7-12, significant dose-related increases in the percentage of litters with resorptions were seen in groups receiving 3.45-8.6 mg Hg/kg/day (Su and Okita 1976). The frequency of clef t palate increased significantly in litters of the 3.45 and 4.3 mg Hg/kg/day groups only. A high inciden ce of delayed palate closure and cleft palate was also reported in mice injected subcutaneously with 5 mg Hg/kg of methylmercuric chloride on Gd 12 (Olson and Massaro 1977). Gross incoordination and decreased frequencies of defecation and urination in pups were observed following intraperitoneal administration of a single dose of methylmercury dicyandiamide(8 mg/kg/day) to pregnant mice on day 7 or 9 of pr egnancy (Spyker et al. 1972). Degenerative changes were observed in the cerebellum and cerebral cortex of rat pups of maternal rats injected with 4 mg Hg/kg as methylmercuric chloride on Gd 8 (Chang et al. 1977). Degenerative renal changes (in epithelial cells of proximal tubules and Bowman's capsule of glomeru li) were reported in rat fetuses of dams exposed intraperitoneally to methylmercuric chloride dur ing Gd 8 (Chang and Sprecher 1976). The studies by Spyker and Smithberg (1972) demonstrated strain di fferences in susceptibility to the developmental effects of methylmercury dicyandiamide. Intraperitoneal administration of single doses of methylmercurydicyandiamide (2, 4, or 8 mg/kg) to pregnant mice of strains 129 Sv/S1 and A/J during gestation resulted in retardation of fetal growth and increased resorption of implants in both strains. Teratogenic effects, primarily of the palate and jaw, were detected at all dose levels in 129 Sv/S1 mice, but only at the highest dose in strain A/J. The differential effects of meth ylmercury were dependent on the strain, the dose of the agent, and the stage of embryonic development. Antilaminin antibodies induced by mercuric chloride ha ve been demonstrated to be detrimental to the development of cultured rat embryos (Chambers a nd Klein 1993). Based upon that observation, those authors suggested that it might be possible for an autoimmune disease induced by a substance such as mercury at an early age to persist into later life, acting as a teratogen indepe ndent of both dose-response relationships and time of exposure, but that possib ility remains to be experimentally demonstrated. One developmental study of phenylmercury compounds was reported by Gale and Ferm (1971) in which hamsters were injected intravenously with pheny lmercuric acetate at doses ranging from 5 to 10 mg/kg on Gd 8. With the exception of the lowest dose, all other doses induced increased resorption rates and edema, along with a few miscellaneous abnormalities including cleft palate and exencephaly. MERCURY 283 2. HEALTH EFFECTS The above information clearly indicates the possibility of developmental toxicity in offspring of mothers that ingest sufficient amounts of organic mercury. The an imal data also suggest that exposure to sufficient amounts of inorganic mercury by inhalation of metallic mercury vapor or ingestion of inorganic mercury may result in developmental toxicity. Genotoxic Effects. The overall findings from cytogenetic mon itoring studies of workers occupationally exposed to mercury compounds by inhalation (Anwar a nd Gabal et al. 1979; Verschaeve et al. 1976, 1979) or accidentally exposed through ingestion (Wulf etal. 1986) provided no convincing evidence that mercur y adversely affects the number or structure of chromosomes in human somatic cells. Studies repor ting a positive result (Anwar and Gabal 1991; Barregard et al. 1991; 1970, et al. 1976; Wulf et al. 1986) werecompromised either by technical problems, a lack of consideration of confounding factors, or a failure to demonstrate a relationship between mercury exposure and induced aberrations. Therefore, none of these studies can be used to predict the potential genetic h azard to humans associated with exposure to mercury or mercury compounds. A dose-related increase in chromosome aberrations was observed in the bone marrow of mice administered a single oral dose of mercuric chloride at levels of at least 4.4 mg Hg/kg (Ghosh et al. 1991). By contrast, there was no valid evidence of a genotoxic effect on so matic cells of cats chronically exposed to methyl- mercury orally (Miller et al. 1979). However, onl y minimal toxicity was observed at the high dose (0.046 mg Hg/kg/day) in this study. Doses of 0.86, 1.7, or 3.4 mg Hg/kg as methylmercury hydroxideadministered once by intraperitoneal injection to groups of 2 male CBA mice did not cause an increase in micronucleated polychromatic erythrocytes harvested from bone marrow cells 24 hours after treatment(Jenssen and Ramel 1980). Similarly, there was no in crease in structural chromosome aberrations in bone marrow cells collected from male Swiss OF 1 mice (3-4/group) 12, 24, 36, or 48 hours postexposure to single intraperitoneal doses of 0.7, 1.5, 3.0, or 4.4 mg Hg/kg as mercuric chloride (Poma et al. 1981). The lack of aclastogenic response, particularly with mercuric chlori de, should not be viewed as a possible inability of this compound to penetrate somatic cell membranes. There are data from the study of Bryan et al. (1974)indicating that mercuric chloride can bind to ch romatin in the livers of mice challenged with 38 mg Hg/kg/day as mercuric chloride for 1 month. Alt hough the overall data are mixed, the findings from a well conducted study using oral dosing suggests that mercur y can be clastogenic for somatic cells (Ghosh et al. 1991).MERCURY 284 2. HEALTH EFFECTS The intraperitoneal administration of mercuric chloride at levels comparable to those described above did not induce a clastogenic response in the spermatogonia of th e same mouse strain (Poma et al. 1981). Structural chromosome aberrations were not produced in metaph ase II oocytes of 15 virgin Syrian hamsters receiving a single intraperitoneal injection of 7.4 mg Hg/kg as methylmercury chloride (Mailhes 1983). However, thefrequency of hyperploid cells in the treated animals was significantly (p<0.01) increased compared to the control. A borderline significant increase in hypoploid cells was also seen. By contrast, Jagiello and Lin (1973) found no evidence of aneuploidy in the oocytes of Swiss/Webster mice (6-8/group) for 3 days after receiving a single intravenous injection of dimethylmercury (140 mg Hg/kg) or mercuric acetate (2, 5, or10 mg Hg/kg). The lack of concordance between these two studies could be related to the different mercurials that were utilized, the different routes of exposure, or the possible differences in species sensitivity. There are data from a series of dominant le thal assays suggesting that variable strain sensitivity to mercury compounds can affect the outcome of germin al cell cytogenetic investigations (Suter 1975). In this study, two strains of male mice, (101\u00d7C3H)F 1 and (SEC\u00d7C57BL)F1, and one strain of female mice, (101\u00d7C3H)F1, received single intraperitoneal injections of 8.6 mg Hg/kg as methylmercuric hydroxide. An additional group of females was injected intraperitonea lly with 1.5 mg Hg/kg as mercuric chloride. Males were sequentially mated with untreated females over the entire spermatogenic cycle; treated females were mated once with untreated males. Methylmercuric hy droxide had no effect on fertility and did not induce a clastogenic response in (101\u00d7C3H)F1 males. However, a comparable dose administered to (SEC\u00d7C57BL)F1 males adversely affected fertility and caused significan t reductions in total and live implants accompanied by increases in the percentage of dead implants followi ng the first two mating cycles. Suggestive evidence of poor reproductive performance and a dominant lethal effect was also seen in female (101\u00d7C3H)F1 mice treated with methylmercuric hydroxide (8.6 mg Hg/kg) and mercuric chloride (1.5 mg Hg/kg). It was noteworthy that an independent phase of the inves tigation examined reproduction in females in two additional strains, (SEC\u00d7C57BL)F1 and a mixed stock obtained by crossing (SEC\u00d7C57BL)F1 females with XGSY males. Neither compound had a detrimental effect on the fertility of these females. The singledominant lethal assay conducted with rats (strain not sp ecified) showed that mercuric chloride, administered orally for 12 months (1.8\u00d710 -3 to 1.8\u00d710-4 mg Hg/kg), induced a dose-related increase in dominant lethal mutations, as indicated by increased embryonic death (Zasukhina et al. 1983). The overall findings from in vivo germinal cell assays suggest that mercury compounds are clastogenic for mammalian germ cells. However, the apparent differe nces in species sensitivity a nd, in some cases, strain MERCURY 285 2. HEALTH EFFECTS sensitivity preclude an extrapolation of the relevance of these findings to humans. Refer to Table 2-11 for a further summary of these results. Several in vitro assays employing human cells were located. Both structural and numerical chromosomal aberrations were observed following the exposure of human lymphocytes to methylmercury chloride or dimethylmercury in vitro (Betti et al. 1992). Although the smoking status of the donor was not reported, all of the cells came from the same donor, and no aberrations were observed in the control cultures. Mercuric acetate caused single-strand breaks in DNA from human KB-cells (Williams et al. 1987). Methylmercuricchloride treatment of human lymphocytes resulted in the formation of chromosome and chromatid aberrations (Betti et al. 1993b). Further, it was found to be a weak inducer of sister chromatid exchange, but that effect did not increase with an increasing dosage. Methylmercuric chloride was also found to be capable of producing aneuploidy (particularly hyperdiploidy) . At low doses, more chromosomal aberrations were observed in the second metaphases than in the first, sugg esting that several premutational lesions induced by that organomercurial survived through one cell cycl e. Thus, the damage produced by methylmercuric chloride appeared to be stable and could lead to chromosome segregation errors. Betti et al. (1993b) concluded that methylmercuric chloride was capable of producing long-lasting dama ge, which in turn gives rise to both structural and numerical chromosome abnormalities. Bala et al. (1993) reported that methyl-mercuric chloride in concentrations of 10 -5, 10-6, and 10-7 M induced aberrant metaphases (including gaps) in cultured human peripheral lymphocytes in a dose-depende nt manner (p<0.05). Methylmercuric chloride at the higher concentrations also induced a significant num ber of breaks. Further, methylmercuric chloride induced a significant number of SCEs per cell in a do se-dependent manner. However, cultures treated with gamma linolenic acid (GLA), a derivative of dietary essential fatty acid, did not differ from controls with respect to aberrations, and GLA reduced the frequency of SCEs induced chloride a dose-dependent manner chloride mutagenic in the Salmonella typhimurium plate incorporation assay (Wong 1988). These negative results are not unexpect ed because the Ames test is not su itable for the detection of heavy metal mutagens. Oberly et al. (1982) reported, howev er, that doses of mercuric chloride (4.4 and 5.9 \u00b5g Hg/mL) approaching severely cytotoxic levels indu ced a weak mutagenic response in mouse lymphoma L5178Y cells but only in the presence of auxiliary metabolic activation. In an in vitro study of the clastogenic effects of mercurials in animal cells, Howard et al. (1991) observed a dose-related increase in chromosome aberrations in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells treated with MERCURY 288 2. HEALTH EFFECTS mercuric chloride. In a study of the potentiating effects of organomercurials on clastogen-induced chromosomal aberrations in cultured Chinese hamster cells , Yamada et al. (1993) investigated the (methylmercuric chloride, ethylmercuric chloride, phenylmercuricchloride, found all to produce remarkable cytotoxicity. Fifty percent or more depression in the mitotic index w as observed following treatment with induced by 4-nitroquinoline 1-oxide and methylmethane sulfonate but they did not themselves. Dimethylmercury, diethylmercury, mercurous chloride, and mercuric ride did potentiating effects. Following pretreatment with the 4-nitroquinoline 1-oxide C, treatment withmethylmercuric chloride during the G1 phase resulted in the enhancement of both breakage- and exchange- type aberrations. Ethylmercuric chloride treatment during the G1 phase also enhanced both types ofaberrations induced by 4-nitroquinoline 1-oxide, but di d not show any potentiating effect. When treatment was during the G2 phase, however, both methylmercuric chloride and ethylmercuric chloride enhanced breakage-type aberrations only. In Yamada et al. (1993) study, the dialkyl mercury compoundsdimethylmercury and diethylmercury did not show any cytotoxicity at 5-40 \u00b5g/mL, but they did cause asignificant increase in the frequency of aberrant cells at the 40 \u00b5g/mL concentration. The authors of this study suggested three possible mechanisms for the observed potentiation of clastogenicity by monoalkylatedmercurials: (1) they interfere with the repair of base lesions induced by 4-nitroquinoline 1-oxide and mitomycin C during the prereplication stage, thus increasing unrepaired DNA lesions that subsequentlyconvert into DNA double-strand breaks in the S phase; (2) methylmercuric chloride (but not ethylmercuricchloride) inhibits the repair of cross-linking lesions dur ing the prereplication stage; and (3) their G2 effects enhance breakage-type aberrations only. Yamada et al. (1993) concluded that because mercury compounds are known to react with protein thiol groups to inhibit protein activity, it is possible that they also inhibitsome protein activities involved in the DNA repair process. The specific target protein for organomercurials and why the potentiation activities of methylmercury chlori de and ethylmercury chloride differ remain to be identified. There is a sizable database of studies investigating the DNA-damaging activity of mercuric chloride. The finding that mercuric chloride can damage DNA in rat and mouse embryo fibroblasts (Zasukhina et al.1983), supports the in vivo evidence of species- and intraspecies-sp ecific sensitivity to the genotoxic action of mercuric chloride. Marked conversion of DNA into the single-stranded form occurred at 10 -6 M MERCURY 289 2. HEALTH EFFECTS mercuric chloride in rat fibroblasts, while 5\u00d710-6 M mercuric chloride produced a comparable response in C57BL/6 mouse cells; at this level, the response in CBA mouse cells was marginal. Mercuric chloride can also bind to the chromatin of rat fibroblasts (Rozal ski and Wierzbicki 1983) hamster ovary cells (Cantoni et al. 1984a, 1984b; Christie et the alkaline elution assay with intactChinese hamster that mercuric chloride induces single-strand breaks in DNA Costa 1983; Cantoni et al. 1982, 1984a, 1984b; Christie et al. 1984, 1985). Furthermore, Cantoni and Costa (1983) found that the DNA-damaging potential of mercuric chloride is enhanced by a concurrent inhibition of DNA repair m echanisms. Methylmercuric chloride induced single- strand breaks in the DNA of intact rat glioblastoma ce lls, Chinese hamster V79 (fetal lung) cells, human lung cells, and human nerve cells (Costa et al. 1991). Results of the Bacillus subtilis rec-assay (Kanematsu et al. 1980) and the sister chromatid exchange assay (Howar d et al. 1991) provide additional support to the body of evidence suggesting that mercuric chloride is genotoxi c. However, there is no clear evidence that mercury would cause DNA damage in vivo . Two organic mercury dose-related responses hamster V-79 cells near threshold (Fis kesjo 1979). neither mutagenic nor caused recombination in Saccharomyces cerevisiae , but it did produce a slight increase in the frequency of chromosomal nondisjunction (Nakai and Machida 1973). Both methylmercury and phenylmercuric primary DNA damage in the B. subtilis rec-assay (Kanematsu et al. 1980). In contrast, high concentrations of methylmercury (1 or 2 \u00b5m) did not increase the frequency of sister chromatid exchanges in cultured blastocysts of ear ly ICR mouse embryos (Matsumoto and Spindle 1982). Severe toxicity, which was more intense in blast ocysts than in morulae, consisted of cessation of preimplantation development, blast ocoel collapse, and mitotic delay. In summary, the body of evidence showing the induction of primary DNA damage in mammalian and bacterial cells and weak mutagenesis in mammalian cells suggests that inorganic and organic mercury compounds have some genotoxic potential. Although th e data on clastogenesis are less consistent, recent well conducted studies suggest that mercury compounds can be clastogenic. Refer to Table 2-12 for a further summary of these results.MERCURY 292 2. HEALTH EFFECTS Cancer. Mercury has not been determined to be carcinogenic in humans (Cragle et al. 1984; Kazantzis 1981). An excess of lung cancer (type not specified) w as found in Swedish chloralkali workers, but these workers had also been exposed to asbestos (Barrega rd et al. 1990). A significant association between the farm use of mercury-containing fungicides and lymphoc ytic leukemia in cattle was presented by Janicki et al. (1987). However, this study is limited because e xposure to other chemicals was not adequately addressed and risk estimates were not adjusted for other risk factors for leukemia. Animal data, however, suggest that mercuric chloride , and methylmercuric chloride, phenylmercuric acetate rats and/or mice. In a 2-year NTP (1993) study, male Fischer 344 rats administeredmercuric chloride by gavage had an increased inciden ce of squamous cell papillomas of the forestomach and an increased incidence of thyroid follicular cell car cinomas at 3.7 mg Hg/kg/day. There is equivocal evidence of carcinogenicity in female rats (a nonsigni ficant incidence of squamous cell papillomas) and in male B6C3F 1 mice (a nonsignificant incidence of renal tubule adenomas and carcinomas). Dietary ICR and B6C3F1 mice to methylmercuric chloride resulte d in significant increases in the incidences of renal epithelial cell adenomas and/or carcinomas in males at doses as low as 0.69-0.73 mg Hg/kg/day(Hirano et al. 1986; Mitsumori et al. 1981, 1990). Sim ilar increases were not observed in females. Renal cell adenomas were also significantly increased in male Wistar rats that received 4.2 mg Hg/kg/day as phenylmercuric acetate in their drinking water (Solecki et al. 1991). This study is limited, however, becausean insufficient number of animals were tested to adequately assess carcinogenicity. Swiss mice were exposed for 15 weeks to drinki ng water containing methylmercuric chloride (Blakley 1984). Urethane (1.5 mg/g) was subsequently given intraperitoneally to the mice at week 3 of the study. Methylmercury exposures of 0.038 and 0.095 mg Hg/kg/day produced a significant increase in the incidence of urethane-inducedpulmonary adenomas. The author suggested that methylmercury enhances the formation of pulmonary adenomas and that the immunosuppressive activity of me thylmercury may be partially responsible for this tumor-enhancing effect. No other studies were located regarding carcinogenic effects in animals following oral exposure to mercury. The Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS ), and the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) have not classified mercury as to its human carcinogenicity. The Environmental Protection Agency has determined that mercury chloride and methylmercury are possible human carcinogens. MERCURY 293 2. HEALTH EFFECTS More on Health Effects and Dental Amalgam. A number of government sponsored scientific reviews of the literature on the health effects associated with the use of dental amalgam have concluded that the data do not demonstrate a health hazard for the large majority of individuals exposed to mercury vapor at levels commonly encountered from dental amalgam (DHHS 1993; Health Canada 1997). Governments that have restricted the use of amalgam or recommend limited use (e.g., Germany, Sweden, Denmark, and Canada ) cite the need to minimize human exposure to all forms of mercury as much as possible and to reduce the release of mercury to the environment (DHHS 1993; Health Canada 1997). The restrictive actions, however are prospective, and none of the government reports recommend removing existing fillings in people who have no indication of adverse effects attributable to mercury exposure. Removal of existing amalgams, if improperly performed or not indicated, may result in unnecessarily high exposure to mercury. Levels of merc ury release for various dental procedures have been reported by Eley (1997). Chelation therapy (used to remove metals from the body tissues) also may have adverse health effects (and varying levels of effec tiveness), and should be consid ered only in consultation with a qualified physician. In 1990 in the United States, over 200 million restor ative procedures were provided of which dental amalgam accounted for roughly 96 million (DHHS 1993). In the 1970s, the use of amalgam was 38%higher. The use of mercury amalgam has been steadily declining and is expected to continue to decline due to improvements in dental hygiene and preventive car e. Approximately 70% of the restorations placed annually are replacements. Advocates of the safety of amalgam emphasize the long history of use (over150 years) and the large exposed population without a pparent adverse effects as strong support for their position (ADA 1997). They also underscore the poor quality of the studies in the literature reporting adverse effects attributable to amalgam. Researchers concerned about the safety of mercury amalgams counter thatsample sizes in the studies that support the safety of am algams are also too small to detect low frequency effects in the general population, and that the absen ce of high quality studies simply reflects the relatively small amount of research effort that has gone into resolving this very important issue (Richardson 1995; Weiner et al. 1990). The general public is also clearly concerned about th e placement of mercury, a substance with demonstrated toxic effects, into their mouths. A survey conducted by the American Dental Association in 1991demonstrated that nearly half of the 1,000 American adults surveyed believed that health problems could develop as a result of dental amalgam (ADA 1991). Increases in life expectancy and increases in the MERCURY 294 2. HEALTH EFFECTS numbers of older adults who still ha ve their permanent teeth will result in longer mercury exposure durations from dental amalgam, which may result in new or increased severity of effects. Recent improvements inneurological measures of performance (especially cognitive and behavior tests) as well as immunologicalassays have also improved the ability to resolve more sub tle or preclinical effects. In this context, DHHS (1993) and other summary reports on the health risks from the use of mercury amalgam generally support the need for further investigations. Additional recommendations concerning the use of dental amalgam include minimizing exposure to populations susceptible to mercury toxicity including pregnant women and nursing women (to minimize the exposure to their developing young), young children up to the age of 6 (and especially up to the age of 3), people with impaired kidney function, and people with hypersensitive imm une response to mercury. People who have higher than average exposures to mercur y from other sources (e.g., people who consume large quantities of fish or who work in professions that expo se them to mercury) should also consider their total mercury exposure in making their life style and health care decisions. In all cases, the choice not to usemercury amalgam should be made in consultation with a qualified dentis ts (and/or physician) and weighed against the risk of alternative practices and materials. The DHHS (1993) report also strongly recommends educa ting the public on the risks and benefits of dental amalgam. To prevent misleading or unduly alarming the public, the layperson should be informed that thepresence of metallic mercury in dental amalgams is, in itself, not sufficient to produce an adverse health effect. Toxic levels of mercury must first be released from the filling, absorbed into the body, and transported to target tissues where adverse effects are produced. What constitutes a \"toxic level\" from an amalgam exposure has been the focus of recent resear ch. Uncertainty continues concerning the presence or absence of a threshold for adverse effects from lo w level chronic exposure to mercury. The above mentioned inadequacies in study size, the measures used for effects, the reproducibility of the results, and the subjective nature of some of the low level eff ects have precluded a consensus in the scientific community on the safety of mercury amalgam. In the absence of clearly defined toxicity from low levelexposures, one approach has been to focus upon dete rmining exposure levels from mercury amalgam, and whether these levels exceed recommended guidelines or regulations. Since these guidelines and regulations (including the MRL) are themselves extrapolated from the hazardous effects literature, there is some circularity in the argument that exposures of merc ury from amalgam that exceed guidelines like the MRL (or other standard) \"support\" the position that mercury amalgams pose a health risk. This aspect of the MERCURY 295 2. HEALTH EFFECTS controversy will only be satisfactorily resolved with be tter toxicity and pharmacokinetic data for chronic low level mercury exposure from amalgams. People who are concerned that their mercury exposure may be causing adverse effects can be tested for allergies to mercury or to other metals, or for the amount of mercury in their body. Tests that measure theamounts of mercury in hair and urine are available a nd provide some indication of the potential for adverse effects from mercury. For more information about the t ests that are available, see Section 2.7, Biomarkers of Exposure and Effects. The following studies supporting or refuting the adverse health effects from exposure to dental amalgam provide some examples from the recent literature of eff ects being evaluated and the procedures that are being used. Some of the studies depend upon the self-reporting of symptoms or may be weakly blinded (i.e., the patients were not completely unaware of the assignmen t to different exposure groups) which could bias the outcome, especially with respect to some of the end poi nts. An exhaustive analysis of the results presented below, however, is beyond the scope of this profile, a nd the reader is referred to the cited references for a more complete discussion of the issues concerning th e potential adverse effects from exposure to dental amalgam. Studies reporting no association between adverse effects and mercury amalgam . Berglund and Molin (1996) evaluated whether a group of patients with symptoms, self-related to their amalgam restorations, experienced an exposure to me rcury vapor from their amalgam restorations that reached the range at which subtle symptoms have b een reported in the literature. They further evaluated whether the mercury exposure for these patients was signi ficantly higher than for controls with no reported health complaints. The symptom group consisted of 10 consecutively selected patients from a larger group. The larger group consisted of patient s who were referred by their physicians for an investigation of a correlation between subjective symptoms and amalga m restorations. The control group consisted of 8 persons with no reported health complaints. The intra-oral release of mercury vapor was measured between 7:45 a.m. and 9:00 p.m. at intervals of 30-45 minutes, following a standardized schedule. Themercury levels in plasma, erythrocytes, and urine we re also determined. The calculated daily uptake of inhaled mercury vapor, released from the amalgam rest orations, was less than 5% of the daily uptake calculated at the lower concentration range given by the WHO (1991), at which subtle symptoms have been found in particularly sensitive individuals. The symp tom group had neither a higher estimated daily uptake MERCURY 296 2. HEALTH EFFECTS of inhaled mercury vapor nor a higher mercury concentr ation in blood and urine than in the control group. The study provided no scientific support for the belief that the symptoms of the patients examined originated from an enhanced mercury release from their amalgam restorations. Bagedahl-Strindlund et al. (1997) evaluated Swedish patients with illnesses thought to be causally related to mercury release during dental restorations, and ma pped the psychological/psychiatric, odontological, and medical aspects of the patients and their purportedly mercury-induced symptoms. A total of 67 consecutivepatients and 64 controls matched for age, sex, a nd residential area were included in the study. Questionnaires were completed and a semi-structured ps ychiatric interview performed. The Comprehensive Psychopathological Rating Scale was used to record psychopatholgical symptoms. The Karolinska Scales of Personality (KSP) set was used to assess personality tr aits. The Toronto Alexithymia Scale and the Schalling-Sifneos Personality Scale were completed. The Whitely Index was used to assess hypochondriacal attitudes. The type and number of amalgam-filled surfaces was determined. The most striking result was thehigh prevalence of psychiatric disorders (predominan tly somatoform disorders) in the patients (89%) compared to the controls (6%). The personality traits differentiating the patients according to the Karolinska Scales of Personality were somatic anxiety, muscular te nsion, psychasthenia, and low socialization. More patients than controls showed alexithymic traits. The prevalence of diagnosed somatic diseases was higher, but not sufficiently so to explain the large difference in perceived health. The multiple symptoms and signs of distress displayed by the patients could not be expl ained either by the odontological data or by the medical examination. These data indicate that the patients s how sociodemographic and clinical patterns similar to those of somatizing patients. The number of amalgam-filled surfaces did not differ significantly betweenpatients and controls; 19% of the patients lacked amalgam fillings. Grandjean et al. (1997a) evaluated the effects of ch elation therapy versus a placebo on patient improvement for patients who attribute their environmental illness to mercury from amalgam fillings. Succimer (meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid) was given at a daily dose of 30 mg/kg for 5 days in a double-blind, randomizedplacebo-controlled trial. Treatment of patients who attribute their environmental illness to mercury from amalgam fillings is largely experimental. On the Symptom Check List, overall distress, and somatization,obsessive-compulsive, depression, and anxiety sympto m dimensions, were increased in 50 consecutive patients examined, and Eysenck Personality Ques tionnaire scores suggested less extroversion and increased degree of emotional lability. Urinary excreti on of mercury and lead was considerably increased in the patients who received the chelator. Immediately after the treatment and 5-6 weeks later, most distress MERCURY 297 2. HEALTH EFFECTS dimensions had improved considerably, but there was no difference between the succimer and placebo groups. These findings suggest that some patients with environmental illness may substantially benefit from placebo. Stoz et al. (1995) studied 185 mothers with tooth amalgam filling surfaces ranging from 0 to 780 mm2 and found no relationship between the blood values of the wo men and their children and the size of the surfaces of the amalgam fillings. All mothers gave birth to h ealthy children. Malt et al. (1997) evaluated the physical and mental symptomatology of 99 self-referred adult patients complaining of multiple somatic and mental symptoms attributed to dental amalgam fillings. These patients were compared with patients with known chronic medical disorders seen in alternative (n=93) and ordinary (n=99) medical family practices and patients with dental amalgam fillings (n=80) seen in an ordinary dental practice. The assessments included written self-reports, a 131-item somatic symptom checklist, Eysenck Personality Questionnaire, the General Health Questionnaire, and Toronto Alexithymia Scale. Somatic symptom complaints were categorized by exhaustion, and musculoskeletal, cardiovascular, and gast rointestinal effects. The mean number of silver fillings surfaces were 40.96 in self-referrents as compared to 36.61 in the dental practice patients. Nocorrelation between number of dental fillings and symp tomatology was found. Self-reports suggested that 62% suffered from chronic anxiety. Forty-seven percent suffered from major depression compared with none in the dental control sample. Symptoms sugges ting somatization disorder were found in 29% of the dental amalgam sample compared with only one subject in the 272 comparison subjects; 37.5% of the dentalamalgam patients reported symptoms of chronic fatigue syndrome compared with none in the dental control sample and only 2 and 6%, respectively, in the two c linical comparison samples. The dental amalgam group reported higher mean neuroticism and lower lie scores than the comparison groups. The authors concluded that self-referred patients with health complaints attr ibuted to dental amalgam are a heterogeneous group of patients who suffer multiple symptoms and frequently have mental disorders. The authors report a striking similarity with the multiple chemical sensitivity syndrome. An ad hoc review group of the DHHS Working Group on Dental Amalgam examined 175 literature articles concerning mercury amalgam (DHHS, 1997). The articles represented an assortment of literature from peer-reviewed journals and a variety of other print media. None of the 12 expert reviewers evaluating the articles suggested that any study under review would indicate that individuals with dental amalgam restorations would experience adverse health effects. Many of the reviewed articles were reported to suffer from inadequacy of experimental control, lack of dose-r esponse information, poor measurement of exposure, and a variety of other experimental design inadequacies.MERCURY 298 2. HEALTH EFFECTS Studies that report an association between dental amalgam and adverse effects . Echeverria et al. (1995) evaluated the behavioral eff ects of low-level exposure to Hg among dentists who had either been exposed to mercury or not as measu red in a selection procedure where the exposed group was defined as those with urinary mercury levels gr eater than 19 \u00b5g/L. Exposure thresholds for health effects associated with elemental mercury exposure were examined by comparing behavioral test scores of 19 exposed (17 males, 2 females) with those of 20 unexposed dentists (14 males, 6 females). The meanurinary Hg of exposed dentists was 36.4 \u00b5g/L, which was 7 times greater than the 5 \u00b5g Hg/L mean level measured in a national sample of dentists (urinary Hg was below the level of detection in unexposed dentists for this study). To improve the distinction between recent and cumulative effects, the study also evaluated porphyrin concentrations in urine, which are correlate d with renal Hg content (a measure of cumulative body burden). Significant urinary Hg dose-effects were f ound for poor mental concentration, emotional lability, somatosensory irritation, and mood scores (tension, fati gue, confusion). Individual tests evaluating cognitive and motor function changed in the expected directions but were not significantly associated with urinary Hg. However, the pooled sum of rank scores for combina tions of tests within domains were significantly associated with urinary Hg, providing evidence of subtle preclinical changes in behavior associated with Hg exposure. Coproporphyrin, one of three urinary porphy rins altered by mercury exposure, was significantly associated with deficits in digit span and simple r eaction time. Exposed dentists placed significantly more amalgams per week (28.0) than unexposed dentists (19.8). No significant differences were found between exposed and unexposed dentists for the overall number of years in practice or the number of amalgams removed per week. Altmann et al. (1998) compared visual functions in 6- year-old children exposed to lead and mercury levels, in a cohort of 384 children (mean age 6.2 years) living in three different areas of East and West Germany. After adjusting for confounding effects, statistically significant lead-related changes were found only for some of the visually evoked potentials (VEP) interpeak latencies, while some of the contrast sensitivity values were significantly reduced with increasing mercur y concentrations. All other outcome variables were not significantly related to lead or mercury levels. Th e authors concluded that even at blood lead levels in the range of 14-174 \u00b5g/L and at very low urinary mercur y levels subtle changes in visual system functions can be measured. The geometric means of urinary mercury concentrations were 0.161, 0.203, and 0.075 \u00b5g Hg/24 hours for subjects of the three study areas (0.157 \u00b5g Hg/24 hours for the total study); the average numbers of amalgam fillings were 0.76, 1.10, and 1. 88, respectively (1.15 amalgam fillings for the total study).MERCURY 299 2. HEALTH EFFECTS Siblerud and Kienholz (1997) investigated whether merc ury from silver dental fillings (amalgam) may be an etiological factor in multiple sclerosis (MS). Blood findings were compared between MS subjects who had their amalgams removed (n=50) and MS subjects with amalgams (n=47). All subjects filled out a health survey, an MS health questionnaire, and a psychologi cal profile; the MS amalgam removal group completed a health questionnaire comparing their health befo re and after amalgam removal. MS subjects with amalgams were found to have significantly lower le vels of red blood cells, he moglobin, and hematocrit compared to MS subjects with amalgam removal. Th yroxine (T-4) levels were also significantly lower in the MS amalgam group, which had significantly lowe r levels of total T-lymphocytes and T-8 (CD8) suppressor cells. The MS amalgam group had significantly higher blood urea nitrogen (BUN) andBUN/creatinine ratio, and lower serum IgG. Hair mercury was significantly higher in the MS subjects compared to the non-MS control group (2.08 versus 1.32 ppm). A health questionnaire found that MS subjects with amalgams had significantly more (33. 7%) exacerbations during the past 12 months compared to the MS volunteers with amalgam removal: 31% of MS subjects felt their MS got better after amalgamremoval, 7% felt it was eliminated, 33% felt no ch ange, and 29% believed the condition got worse. In addition, 17% of the MS with amalgam group had more neuromuscular symptoms compared to the amalgam removal group. Bj\u00f6rkman et al. (1997) examined the mercury concentrations in saliva, feces, urine, whole blood, and plasma before and after removal of dental amalgam f illings in 10 human subjects. Before removal, the median mercury concentration in feces was more than 10 times higher than in samples taken from an amalgam-free reference group of 10 individuals. Two days following removal of all amalgams, a considerable increase in mercury appeared in the f eces. This initial increase was followed by a significant decrease. In saliva, there was an exponential decline in the mercury c oncentration during the first 2 weeks after amalgam removal (t 1/2 of 1.8 days). The authors concluded that while mercury amalgam fillings are a significant source of mercury in saliva and feces, t hose levels decrease considerably following amalgam removal. Further, the gastrointestinal uptake of mercury seen in conjunction with removal of amalgam fillings appears to be low. Of 108 patients (a ll with amalgam dental fillings) presenting to an environmental toxicology service, the average sa livary mercury level was 11 \u00b5g/L (range, <1-19 \u00b5g/L) before chewing and 38 \u00b5g/L (range, 6-500 \u00b5g/L) after chewing. Six of the 108 patients had salivary mercury concentrations >100 \u00b5g/L. Of 58 patients with suspected allergic disease, an epicutaneous test for amalgam was positive in 32 of them; however, direct involvement of dental amalgams in these sensitivitieswas not mentioned. Seventy-five of the total patie nts presenting with symptoms felt that amalgam fillings MERCURY 300 2. HEALTH EFFECTS or other dental materials were responsible, at least in part, for their symptoms, although no causal relationship was borne out by medical evaluation. Bratel et al. (1996) investigated (1) healing of oral lichenoid reactions (OLR) following the selective replacement of restorations of dental amalgam, (2) wh ether there were differences in healing between contact lesions (CL) and oral lichen planus (OLP), and (3) wh ether there was a difference in healing potential when different materials were selected as a substitute for de ntal amalgam. Patients included in the study presented with OLR confined to areas of the oral mucosa in cl ose contact with amalgam restorations (CL; n=142) or with OLR which involved other parts of the oral mucosa as well (OLP; n=19). After examination,restorations of dental amalgam which were in cont act with OLR in both patient groups were replaced. The effect of replacement was evaluated at a follow-up afte r 6-12 months. In the CL group, the lesions showed a considerable improvement or had totally disappeared in 95% of the patients after replacement of the restorations of dental amalgam (n=474). This eff ect was paralleled by a disappearance of symptoms, in contrast to patients with persisting CL (5%) who did not report any significant improvement. The healing response was not found to correlate with age, gende r, smoking habits, subjective dryness of the mouth or current medication. However, the healing effect in patients who received gold crowns was superior than in patients treated with metal-ceramic crowns (MC) (p <0.05). In the OLP group (n=19), 63% of the patients with amalgam-associated erosive and atrophic lesions showed an improvement following selectivereplacement. OLP lesions in sites not in contact with amalgams were not affected. Most of the patients (53%) with OLP reported symptoms also after replacement. From these data the authors conclude that in the vast majority of cases, CL resolves following selectiv e replacement of restorations of dental amalgam, provided that a correct clinical diagnosis is establishe d. The authors note that MC crowns did not facilitate healing of CL to the same extent as gold crowns. Hultman et al. (1994) studied the effects of dental amalgams in in-bred mice genetically susceptible to mercury-induced immunotoxic effects. Following intraperitoneal implantation of a silver amalgam andobservation for up to 6 months, chronic hyperimmunoglobulinemia, targeting thenucleolar protein fibrillarin, deposits developed in both a time- and dose- dependent manner. The functional capacity of spleni c T- and B-cells was affected in a dose-dependent fashion. In this study, not only did the dental amalgam implantation cause chronic stimulation of theimmune system with induction of systemic autoimmunity , but the implantation of silver alloy not containing mercury also induced autoimmunity, suggesting that ot her metals have the potential to induce autoimmunity in that genetically susceptible strain of mice. Accu mulation of heavy metals from dental amalgams, as well MERCURY 301 2. HEALTH EFFECTS as from other sources, may lower the threshold of an individual metal to elicit immune aberrations, which could lead to overt autoimmunity. 2.6 CHILDREN'S SUSCEPTIBILITY This section discusses potential health effects from e xposures during the period from conception to maturity at 18 years of age in humans, when all biological systems will have fully developed. Potential effects onoffspring resulting from exposures of parental germ ce lls are considered, as well as any indirect effects on the fetus and neonate due to matern al exposure during gestation and l actation. Relevant animal and in vitro models are also discussed. Children are not small adults. They differ from a dults in their exposures and may differ in their susceptibility to hazardous chemicals. Children's unique physiology and behavior can influence the extent of their exposure. Exposures of children are discussed in Section 5.6, Exposures of Children. Children sometimes differ from adults in their susceptibility to hazardous chemicals, but whether there is a difference depends on the chemical (Guzelian et al. 1992; NRC 1993). Children may be more or less susceptible than adults to health e ffects, and the relationship may change with developmental age (Guzelian et al. 1992; NRC 1993). Vulnerability often depends on de velopmental stage. There are critical periods of structural and functional developmen t during both pre-natal and post-natal life and a particular structure or function will be most sensitive to disruption during its critical period(s). Damage may not be evident until a later stage of development. There are often di fferences in pharmacokinetics and metabolism between children and adults. For example, absorption may be di fferent in neonates because of the immaturity of their gastrointestinal tract and their larger skin surf ace area in proportion to body weight (Morselli et al. 1980; NRC 1993); the gastrointestinal absorption of lead is greatest in infants and young children (Ziegler et al. 1978). Distribution of xenobiotics may be different; for example, infants have a larger proportion of their bodies as extracellular water and their brains and liver s are proportionately larger (Altman and Dittmer 1974; Widdowson and Dickerson 1964). The infant also has an immature blood-brain barrier (Adinolfi 1985; Johanson 1980) and probably an immature blood-testis barrier (Setchell and Waites 1975). Many xenobiotic me tabolizing enzymes have distinctive developmental patterns and at various stages of growth and developm ent, levels of particular enzymes may be higher or lower than those of adults and sometimes unique enzy mes may exist at particular developmental stages (Komori et al. 1990; Leeder and Kearns 1997; NRC 1993; Vieira et al. 1996). MERCURY 302 2. HEALTH EFFECTS Whether differences in xenobiotic metabolism make th e child more or less susceptible also depends on whether the relevant enzymes are involved in activa tion of the parent compound to its toxic form or in detoxification. There may also be differences in ex cretion, particularly in the newborn who has a low glomerular filtration rate and has not developed e fficient tubular secretion and resorption capacities (Altman and Dittmer 1974; NRC 1993; West et al. 1948). Children and adults may differ in their capacity to repair damage from chemical insults. Children also have a longer lifetime in which to express damage from chemicals; this potential is particularly relevant to cancer. Certain characteristics of the developing human may increase exposure or susceptibility while others may decrease susceptibility to the same chemi cal. For example, the fact that infants breathe more air per kilogram of body weight than adults may be some what counterbalanced by their alveoli being less developed, so there is a disproportionately smaller surface area for absorption (NRC 1993). Adverse health effects from different forms of merc ury differ primarily because of differences in kinetics rather than mode of action. As discussed in the in troduction to this section, children have different, and sometimes dramatically different, morphology or phy siology that alters the way toxic compounds are absorbed and distributed throughout their bodies. For mercury compounds, preventing entry into the systemic circulation is the best means to prevent adve rse effects. Once mercury enters the circulation, the tissues that end up as target sites are those that accumula te the most mercuric ion or the ones that are most often exposed to mercuric ion. That is why the kidney is a prime target site, for in fulfilling its major role of filtering and purifying the blood, the kidney is con tinually exposed to ionic mercury. The central nervous system is a major target site because mercur ic ion also concentrates in the brain compartment. Ironically, it may be the blood-brain barrier that c ontributes to, rather than prevents, mercuric ion \"trapping\" in the brain. A current hypothesis is that once lipophilic forms of mercury cross the blood-brain barrier, they are oxidized to more hydrophilic species and become trapped inside the brain compartment. This \"one way\" only kinetic pathwa y results in continually increasing brain mercuric ion levels, as long as nonpolar forms are in the blood stream. Even small amounts of nonpolar mercury (<2 g) in the body may eventually lead to central ne rvous system damage (Neirenberg et al. 1998). The low capacity for central nervous system tissues to regenerate and the fact that even subtle damage to small areas of the brain can have profound overall effects, makes th is tissue very susceptible to the highly toxic mercuric ion. These factors, and a slow but inevitable trapping of mercuric ions may lead to the mercury-induceddelayed central nervous system toxicity observed m onths to years after exposure ceases (Neirenberg et al. 1998, Rice 1996a). Even potent chelators have not b een effective in interfering with progressive central nervous MERCURY 303 2. HEALTH EFFECTS system damage once a nonpolar mercury compound gains access to the circulatory system and begins to concentrate in tissues (Neirenberg et al. 1998, Taueg et al. 1992). For similar routes and forms of mercury, the adverse hea lth effects seen in children are similar to the effects seen in adults. For example, a young child who was intoxicated with mercury vapor, died of pulmonaryedema and had a grayish, necrotic mucosa of the stomach and duodenum (Campbell 1948). These effects aresimilar to those seen in adult populations occupati onally exposures to inhaled metallic mercury vapors. Respiratory effects in adults from inhalation of me tallic mercury vapor include pulmonary fibrosis, desquamation of the bronchi olar epithelium, and death in severe cases due to respiratory failure (Gore and Harding 1987; Jaffe et al. 1983; Kanluen and Gottlieb 1991; Matthes et al. 1992; Teng and Br ennan 1959; Tennant et al. 1961). The majority of the information regarding cardiovascu lar effects comes from reports of children who were treated with mercurous chloride tablets for worms or mercurous chloride-containing powders for teething discomfort (Warkany and Hubbard 1953). These author s described multiple cases in which tachycardia and elevated blood pressure were observed in the affected children. Electrocardiography in four family members who ate meat from a hog that had consumed seed treated with ethylmercuric chloride showed abnormal heart rh ythms (ST segment depression and T wave inversion) (Cinca et al. 1979). Death of the two children in the fa mily was attributed to cardiac arrest, and autopsy of these boys showed myocarditis. Cardiovascular abnormalities were also observed in severe cases of poisoning in the Iraqi epidemic of 1956, when wid espread poisoning resulted from eating flour made from seed grains treated with ethylmercury p-toluene sulfonanilide (Jalili and Abbasi 1961). These abnormalities included pulse, occasionally with bradycardia, and electrocardiograms showing ventricular ectopicbeats, prolongation of the Q-T interval, de pression of the S-T segment, and T inversion. Several children who were treated with mercurous chlo ride for constipation, worms, or teething discomfort had swollen red gums, excessive salivation, anorexia , diarrhea, and/or abdominal pain (Warkany and Hubbard 1953). They also experienced muscle twitching or cramping in the legs and/or arms, but these muscular effects were probably secondary to changes in electrolyte balance (i.e., potassium imbalance due to fluid loss or renal wasting).MERCURY 304 2. HEALTH EFFECTS Acute renal failure that persisted for 10 days w as observed in a 19-month-old child who ingested an unknown amount of powdered mercuric chloride (Samuels et al. 1982). Several children who were treated with medications containing mercurous chloride for c onstipation, worms, or teething discomfort exhibited flushing of the palms of the hands and soles of th e feet (Warkany and Hubbard 1953). The flushing was frequently accompanied by itching, swelling, and desquamation of these areas. Morbilliform rashes, conjunctivitis, and excessive perspiration were also frequently observed in the affected children. Patch tests conducted in several children revealed that the rashes were not allergic reactions to the mercury. They also had irritability, fretfulness, sleeplessness, weakness, photophobia, muscle twitching, hyperactive orhypoactive tendon reflexes, and/or confusion. A 13-month-old child who ingested porridge made from flour that had been treated with an alkyl mercury compound (specific mercury compound not reported) de veloped a measles-like rash, fever, and facial flushing (Engleson and Herner 1952). A 4-year-old boy who had been given a Chinese medicine containing mercurous chloride for 3 months deve loped drooling, dysphagia, irregular arm movements, and impaired gait (Kang-Yum and Oransky 1992). A number of children who were treated with an ammoniated mercury ointment or whose diapers had been rinsed in a me rcuric chloride solution experienced tachycardia and elevated blood pressure, and anorex ia (Warkany and Hubbard 1953). In addition, rashes, conjunctivitis, and/or excessive perspiration were observed. These dermal and ocular reactions were not attributed to allergic-type reac tions to the mercury. A 23-month-old boy who was exposed to an unspecified form of mercury also deve loped a \"diffuse, pinpoint, erythematous, papular rash\" and bright finger tips \"with large sheets of peeling skin\" (Tunnessen et al. 1987). A woman chronically exposed to an undetermined con centration of mercury vapor reported that her first pregnancy resulted in spontaneous a bortion, and her second resulted in th e death of the newborn soon after birth (Derobert and Tara 1950). It is unclear whethe r the reproductive toxicity experienced by the woman was due to the mercury exposure. However, after r ecovery from overt mercury poisoning, she gave birth to a healthy child. Not all exposures lead to immediate adverse effects. A woman occupationally exposed to mercury vapors for 2 years prior to pregnancy and th roughout pregnancy was reporte d to have delivered a viable infant at term (Melkonian and Baker 1988). Ur inary mercury in the woman at 15 weeks of pregnancy was 0.875 mg/L (normal levels are approximately 0.004 mg/L). A case report of a woman exposed to mercury vapors in her home during the first 17 weeks of pregnancy reported that the woman delivered a normal child who met all developmental milestones (although the child was not formally tested MERCURY 305 2. HEALTH EFFECTS for psychological development) (Thorpe et al. 1992). Mercury exposure was not measured, but the child was born with hair levels of 3 mg/kg (3 ppm) of mercury. This hair level was comparable to that observed in populations consuming fish once a week (WHO 1990) and suggests that exposure in this case may have been relatively low. In the in vivo study by Sager et al. (1982), it was conclude d that methylmercury may be acting on mitotic spindle microtubules leading to cell injury in the deve loping cerebellar cortex. Cell injury observed in the external granular layer of the cerebellar cortex of 2- day-old rats was attributed to a reduced percentage of late mitotic figures (arrested cell division) due to the loss of spindle microtubules. Mitosis and migration ofgranule cells in the cerebellum end within weeks fo llowing birth; therefore, this observation may suggest potential differences in the sensitivities of children and adults to mercury-induced neurotoxicity. Regardless of whether mercury exposure is through i nhalation of mercury vapors, ingestion of organic mercury or mercury salts, or dermal application of mercury-containing ointments, patients (primarily children) may exhibit a syndrome known as acrodynia, or pink disease. Acrodynia is often characterized bysevere leg cramps; irritability; and erythema and subseque nt peeling of the hands, nose, and soles of the feet. Itching, swelling, fever, tachycardia, elevated blood pressure, excessive salivation or perspiration, morbilliform rashes, fretfulness, sleeplessness, and/or weakness may also be present. It was formerly thought that this syndrome occurred exclusively in ch ildren, but recent reported cases in teenagers and adults have shown that these groups are also susceptible. Developmental effects from prenatal or postnatal e xposures to mercury are unique to children. During critical periods of structural and functional developm ent in both prenatal and postnatal life, children are especially vulnerable to the toxic effects of mercury. Inhalation exposures are relatively rare outside of the occupational setting so the exposure route and form of mercury most commonly associated with a risk fordevelopment effects is the ingestion of methylmercury on the surface of contaminated foods (methylmercuryused as a fungicide on seed grain) or accumulated within the food (methylmercury in fish, wild game, and marine mammals). The exposure route and form of mercury most commonly associated with maternalexposures is to foods contaminated with methylmercury fungicides (Bakir et al. 1973) or foods that contain high levels of methylmercury (Grandjean et al. 1997b, 1998; Tsubaki and Takahashi 1986). The first such incident was reported in Sweden in 1952 when flour from grain treated with an unspecified alkyl mercury compound ingested by a pregnant woman was associated with developmental toxicity. An MERCURY 306 2. HEALTH EFFECTS apparently normal infant was born, but the infant later displayed brain damage manifested by mental retardation, incoordination, and inability to move (Engleson and Herner 1952). A 40-year-old woman, 3 months pregnant, consumed me thylmercury-contaminated meat for an unspecified duration and subsequently delivered a male infant with elevated urinary mercury levels (Snyder and Seelinger 1976). At 3 months, the infant was hypotonic, irritable, and exhibited myoclonic seizures. At 6 years of age, the childdisplayed severe neurological impairment (e.g., bli ndness, myoclonic seizures, neuromuscular weakness, inability to speak) (Snyder and Seelinger 1976). Another incidence of neurodevelopmental effects occurring as a result of in utero exposure to methyl- mercury was reported by Cox et al. (1989) and WHO (1990) . The effect of concern was the delayed onset of walking in offspring in Iraqi children whose mo thers were exposed to methylmercury through the consumption of seed grain treated with methylmercury as a fungicide (Al-Mufti et al. 1976; Bakir et al.1973; Cox et al. 1989; Marsh et al. 1981, 1987). A New Mexico family, including a pregnant woman, a 20-year-old female, and 2 children (a 13-year-old male and an 8-year-old female) ate meat from a hog inadvertently fed seed grain treated with a fungicidecontaining methylmercury and experienced severe, delaye d neurological effects (Davis et al. 1994). Several months after the exposures, the children developed sy mptoms of neurological dysfunction. The newborn child of the exposed mother showed signs of central ne rvous system disorder from birth. Twenty-two years after the 3-month exposure period, the people who were 20 and 13 years old at time of exposure had developed cortical blindness or constricted visual fi elds, diminished hand proprioception, choreoathetosis, and attention deficits. MRI examination of these tw o revealed residual brain damage in the calcarine cortices, parietal cortices, and cerebellum. The brai n of the person who was exposed at age 8 (who died of aspiration pneumonia with a superimposed Klebsiella bronchopneumonia and sepsis at age 29) showed cortical atrophy, neuronal loss, and gliosis, most pronoun ced in the paracentral and parieto-occipital regions. Regional brain mercury levels correlated with the extent of brain damage. The youngest ( in utero at the time of exposure) developed quadriplegia, blindness, severe me ntal retardation, choreoathetosis, and seizures, and died at age 21. Since inorganic mercury crosses the blood-brain barrier poorly, biotransformation of themethylmercury to inorganic mercury may have occurred after the methylmercury crossed the blood-brainbarrier, accounting for its observed persistence in the br ain and its possible contribution to the brain damage.MERCURY 307 2. HEALTH EFFECTS More recently, Grandjean et al. (1997b, 1998) eval uated a cohort of 1,022 consecutive singleton births generated during 1986-1987 in the Fa roe Islands. Increased methylmercury exposure from maternal consumption of pilot whale meat was indicated by merc ury concentrations in cord blood and maternal hair. Neurophysiological tests emphasized motor coordination, perceptual-motor performance, and visual acuity;pattern reversal visual evoked poten tials (VEP) with brain stem potentials (BAEP), postural sway, and the coe fficient of variation for R-R interpeak intervals (CVRR) on the electrocardiogram were measured. Clinical examination and neurophysiological testing didnot neuropsychological dysfunctions were most pronounced in the domains of language, attention, and memory, and to a lesser extent in visuospatial and motor functions. These associ ations remained after adjustment for covariates and after exclusion of children of mothers with maternal ha ir mercury concentrations above 10 \u00b5g/g (50 nmol/g). The effects on brain function associated with prenatal methylmercury exposure appear widespread, and early dysfunction is detectable at exposure levels currently considered safe. There are differences in the outcomes of these epid emiology studies on low level chronic exposures to methylmercury in foods. Davidson et al. (1998) repor t no adverse developmental effects associated with prenatal and postnatal exposure to methylmercury in fish in a Seychelles Island cohort of children at age 66 months (n=708). The exposure levels are reflected in maternal hair levels of 6.8 ppm for the prenatal exposure (SD=4.5, n=711) and children' s hair levels of 6.5 ppm (SD=3.3, n=708) for both the prenatal and subsequent postnatal exposure. The age-appropriate main outcome measures included: (1) the McCarthy Scales of Children's Abilities, (2) the Preschool Language Scale, (3) the Woodcock-Johnson Tests ofAchievement - Letter and Word Recognition, (4) W oodcock-Johnson Tests of Achievement - Applied Problems and, (5) the Bender Gestalt test, and (6) the Child Behavior Checklist. The test results were similar to what would be expected from a healthy, well-developing U.S. population. No test indicated a deleterious effect of methylmercury from the exposure le vels received in this population. Four of the six measures showed better scores in the highest MeHg gr oups compared with lower groups for both prenatal and postnatal exposure. This result is likely due to th e benefits of increased levels of fish in the diet, possibly because of increased consumption of omega-3 -fatty acids. Serum from a subset of 49 of the children was sampled for polychlorinated biphenyl leve ls (PCBs). None of the samples had detectable levels (detection limit 0.2 ng/mL) for any of the 28 congeners assayed (from congener 28 to 206) indicating that was no concurrent (i.e, potentially confounding) e xposure to PCBs in this population. The median level of total mercury for each of 25 species sampled was 0.004-0.75 ppm, with most medians in the range of 0.05-0.25 ppm, levels that are comparable to fish in the U.S. market. The authors conclude that this MERCURY 308 2. HEALTH EFFECTS most recent NOAEL of 6.8 ppm for the Seychelles cohor t at 66 months of age strongly supports the findings at earlier ages, and that the benefits of eating fish outweigh the small risk of adverse effects from anincreased exposure to methylmercury for this exposure pathway. The differences in these studies highlight the importance of interpreting epidemiology results and, indeed, all study results on mercury toxicity within a fairly co mprehensive context of the numerous factors that might affect the toxicokinetics and the amount absorbed (e.g., form of mercury, route of exposure, age, diet of population exposed, health status, other potential sources of exposure to mercury, dose duration, constancy of dose amount over time, etc.) A route of exposure unique to children is breast milk. Both organic and inorganic mercury can move into breast milk from a nursing woman's body, and children will readily absorb this mercury. Oskarsson et al.(1996) assessed the total and inorganic mercury conten t in breast milk and blood in relation to fish consumption and amalgam fillings (a n exposure source for older children) . Total mercury concentrations were evaluated in breast milk, blood, and hair sampl es collected 6 weeks after delivery from 30 lactating Swedish women. In breast milk, about half of the to tal mercury was inorganic and half was methylmercury, whereas in blood only 26% was inorganic and 74% was methylmercury. That is because, unlike theplacental barrier, which is crossed more easily by me thylmercury than by inorganic mercury, inorganic mercury moves more easily into breast milk. Some researchers think that a carrier mediated process is involved (Sundberg et al 1998). For the Swedish population in the study, Oskarsson et al. (1996) reports that there was an efficient transfer of inorganic mercury from blood to breast milk and that mercury from amalgam fillings was probably the main source of mercury in breast milk, while methylmercur y levels in blood did not appear to be efficiently transferred to breast milk . Exposure of the infant to mercury in breast milk was calculated to range up to 0.3 \u00b5g/kg/day of which approximately one-half was inorganic mercury. This exposure corresponds to approximately one-half the tolerable daily intake of total mercury for adults recommended by the World Health organization. The authors concluded that e fforts should be made to decrease total mercury burden in women of reproductive age Oskarsson et al. (1996). The metabolism of mercury is relatively straightforw ard compared, for example, to pesticides or some organic solvents. No information was identified to indicate that metabolic pathways are different for children and adults, or that child ren have unique metabolites. Once absorbed, metallic and inorganic MERCURY 309 2. HEALTH EFFECTS mercury enter an oxidation-reduction cycle. Metallic me rcury is oxidized to the divalent inorganic cation in the red blood cells and lungs of humans and animals. Evidence from animal studi es suggests the liver as an additional site of oxidation. Absorbed divalent cation from exposure to mercuric mercury compounds can, in turn, be reduced to the metallic or monovalent fo rm and released as exhaled metallic mercury vapor. In the presence of protein sulfhydryl groups, mercurous mercury (Hg+) disproportionates to one divalent cation and one molecule at the zero oxidation state (Hg0). The conversion of methylmercury or phenyl- mercury into divalent inorganic mercury can probably occur soon after absorption, also feeding into the oxidation-reduction pathway. A number of good physiologically based pharmacokinetic models are currently available for mercury, including some that address developmental toxicity and maternal/fetal transfer. Two models were constructed based upon data from the kinetics of methyl mercury in rats. Farris et al. (1993) developed a PBPK model that simulates the long-term disposition of methylmercury and its primary biotransformation product, mercuric mercury, in the male Sprague-Daw ley rat following a single oral nontoxic exposure. Gray (1995) developed a PBPK model that simulates the kineti cs of methylmercury in the pregnant rat and fetus. The Gray model was developed to provide fetal a nd maternal organ methylmercury concentration-time profiles for any maternal dosing regimen. Sundberg et al. (1998) fitted a three compartment model to theelimination kinetics of methylmercury and inorganic me rcury transfer to milk in lactating and nonlactating mice. Luecke et al. (1997) developed a model based on human physiology but extended to simulate animal data that depict internal disposition of two chemical s (singly or in combination) during pregnancy in the mother and the embryo/fetus. Leroux et al. (1996) developed a biologically based-dose-response model to describe the dynamics of organogenesis, based on the bran ching process models of cell kinetics. Gearhart et al. (1995) developed a PBPK model to coherently describe methylmercury pharmacokinetics in a variety of species (adult rat, monkey, and human), and to pr edict fetal levels of methylmercury from an i n utero exposure. No information was identified on biomarkers of exposure for children. Mercury levels in hair, urine, and blood are the standard measures of exposure. There ar e biomarkers for developmental effects that are unique to specific ages and stages of development throughout the child's developmental process. Developing the best measures for evaluation of cognitive functions is an area of intense debate and on-going research.MERCURY 310 2. HEALTH EFFECTS Concerning interactions with other chemicals, there is an ongoing debate about the value of fish in the diet versus the risk from increased exposure to methylmercury that may be in the fish. One recent study reported a beneficial effect from increased fish consumpti on even though mercury body burdens were increased to some extent (Davidson et al. 1998). One possible factor in the fish that could improve health is omega 3- fatty acid. Children and adults both benefit from a h ealthy diet, but there may more emphasis on the benefits to growing children. Other interactions for merc ury include the effect of various substances on its gastrointestinal absorption (e.g., iron, zinc) or po ssibly protective effects from prevention or repair of mercury related oxidative damage (e.g ., interactions with selenium as an antioxidant). No information was identified that specifically addresses differences in th ese interactions for children compared to adults. The methods used to reduce peak absorption and to re duce body burdens in exposed adults (i.e., chelation therapy) are also used for exposures in children. No information was identified on parental exposures a ffecting children in areas of parental germ cells or germ line mutations. The topic of exposure pathways for mercury via nursing or pregnant women who have been exposed is of main concern and has been addressed earlier in this section. 2.7 BIOMARKERS OF EXPOSURE AND EFFECT Biomarkers are broadly defined as indicators signaling events in biological systems or samples. They have been classified as markers of exposure, markers of effect, and markers of susceptibility (NAS/NRC 1989). A biomarker of exposure is a xenobiotic substance or its metabolite(s), or the product of an interaction between a xenobiotic agent and some target molecule(s ) or cell(s), that is measured within a compartment of an organism (NAS/NRC 1989). The preferred biomar kers of exposure are generally the substance itself or substance-specific metabolites in readily obtainable body fluid(s) or excreta. However, several factors can confound the use and interpretation of biomarkers of exposure. The body burden of a substance may be the result of exposures from more than one source. The substance being measured may be a metabolite of another xenobiotic substance (e .g., high urinary levels of phenol can result from exposure to several different aromatic compounds). Depe nding on the properties of the substance (e.g., biological half-life) and environmental conditions (e.g., dura tion and route of exposure), the s ubstance and all of its metabolites may have left the body by the time samples can be taken. It may be difficult to identify individuals exposed MERCURY 311 2. HEALTH EFFECTS to hazardous substances that are commonly found in body tissues and fluids (essential mineral nutrients [e.g., copper, zinc, and selenium]). Biomarkers of e xposure to mercury are discussed in Section 2.7.1. Biomarkers of effect are defined as any measurable bi ochemical, physiological, or other alteration within an organism that, depending on magnitude, can be recogni zed as an established or potential health impairment or disease (NAS/NRC 1989). This definition encompasses biochemical or cellular signals of tissuedysfunction (e.g., increased liver enzyme activity or pat hological changes in female genital epithelial cells), as well as physiological signs of dysfunction such as increased blood pressure or decreased lung capacity. Note that these markers are not often substance specific. They also may not be directly adverse, but they can indicate potential health impairment (e.g., DNA adducts). Biomarkers of effect caused by mercury are discussed in Section 2.7.2. A biomarker of susceptibility is an indicator of an inhe rent or acquired limitation of an organism's ability to respond to the challenge of exposure to a specific xenobio tic substance. It can be an intrinsic genetic or other characteristic or a pre-existing disease that results in an increase in the absorb ed dose, a decrease in the biologically effective dose, or a target tissue respon se. If biomarkers of susceptibility exist, they are discussed in Section 2.8 (Populations That Are Unusually Susceptible). 2.7.1 Biomarkers Used to Identify or Quantify Exposure to Mercury Blood and urine mercury concentrations are commonly used as biomarkers of exposure to mercury. Hair has been used as a biomarker of exposure to methylmerc ury. Occupational studies show that recent mercury exposure is reflected in blood and urine (Naleway et al. 1991; WHO 1991). However, at low exposure levels (<0.05 mg Hg/m 3), correlation to blood or urine mercury levels is low (Lindstedt et al. 1979). Blood levels of mercury peak sharply during and soon after short- term exposures, indicating that measurements should be made soon after exposure (Cherian et al. 1978). The specific time frame at which measurements become lessreliable has not been determined. Workers exposed for a chronic duration, however, may have a high body burden of mercury, therefore, merc ury levels would probably still be el evated in the urine and blood for a long period of time after cessation of exposure (Linds tedt et al. 1979). The following discussion of blood and urine mercury levels generally re fers to measurements taken immediately or within a few days following the last exposure.MERCURY 312 2. HEALTH EFFECTS The mean total mercury levels in whole blood a nd urine of the general population are approximately 1-8 \u00b5g/L and 4-5 \u00b5g/L, respectively (Gerhard sson and Brune 1989; WHO 1990). Recently, the International Commission on Occupational Health (ICOH) and the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) Commission on Toxicology determ ined that a mean value of 2 \u00b5g/L was the background blood level of mercury in persons who do not eat fish (Nordberg et al. 1992). These blood and urine levels are \"background\" in the sense that they represent the average levels in blood in the general population and are not associated with a particular s ource for mercury. However, the intra- and inter- individual differences in these biomarkers are substan tial, possibly due to dental amalgams (urine) and ingestion of contaminated fish (blood) (Verschoor et al. 1988; WHO 1991). Long-term consumption of fish is the source of nearly all of the methylmercury measured in the general population, and individuals in communities with high fish consumption rates have been shown to have blood leve ls of 200 \u00b5g/L, with daily intake of 200 \u00b5g mercury (WHO 1990). However, acu te inhalation exposure to low levels of metallic mercury resulted in much lower levels in the blood (0.028 and 0.18 \u00b5g/100 mL) and urine (from 94 to >438 \u00b5g/L) (Kanluen and Gottlieb 1991; Rowens et al. 1991). Urine mercury measurement is reliable and simple, a nd it provides rapid identification of individuals with elevated mercury levels (Naleway et al. 1991). It is a more appropriate marker of inorganic mercury, because organic mercury represents only a small fraction of urinary mercury. Yoshida (1985) found thaturinary mercury levels were better correlated w ith exposure than were blood inorganic mercury concentrations in workers exposed to metallic mercury vapor. Several studies have reported a correlation between merc ury in blood and urine; however, results vary, and it is not known whether the ratio between concentrati ons in urine and blood remains constant at different exposure levels (Lindstedt et al. 1979; Roels et al. 1987; Smith et al. 1970). Significant correlations between occupational exposure to me rcury vapor and mercury levels in the blood and urine of 642 workers in 21 chloralkali facilities were reported by Smith et al. (1970). According to the investigators, an air concentration (8-hour TWA) of 0.1 mg/m 3 was associated with blood levels of 6 \u00b5g/100 mL and urine levels of 220 (not corrected for specific gravity), 200, or 260 \u00b5g/L (corrected to specific gravities of 1.018 or 1.024, respectively). It is likely that current worker exposure is significantly less than this study indicates, because practices such as requiring showers afte r workshifts and cleaning work clothes after use have been implemented since 1970, when the Smith st udy was conducted. Another group of investigators, Henderson et al. (1974), found the concentrations repor ted in Smith et al. (1970) to be 2-10 times higher than those found 2 years later. As suggested by Roels et al. (1982), the actual mercury absorption by MERCURY 313 2. HEALTH EFFECTS workers exposed to the same air concentration ma y vary; therefore, researchers should report urine mercury levels together with estimated exposure c oncentrations to address the issue of variance between individuals. Studies assessing mercury vapor exposure have suggested various ratios relating the concentration of mercury in the air (in \u00b5g/m3) to the levels of mercury in the urine (in \u00b5g/L). Such estimates include 1:1 (Bell et al. 1973), 1:1.22 (Roels et al. 1987), and 1: 2.5 (Lindstedt et al. 1979; Rosenman et al. 1986). Urinary metallic mercury levels ranging from 0.05 to 1. 7 \u00b5g/L were detected in the urine of workers exposed to mercury vapor (>0.1 mg/m3); this elemental mercury represented <1% of the inorganic mercury content of the urine (Yoshida and Yamamura 1982). With increased exposure to mercury vapor (0.47-0.67 mg/m3), the amount of elemental mercury in the urine increased. A \"rough\" correlation between levels of metallic mercury vapor in air a nd mercury levels in blood and urine was established by Rosenman et al. (1986). They associated levels of 50 \u00b5g/100 mL in blood and 250 \u00b5g/L in urine with a mercury level in air of approximately 0.1 mg/m3 (8-hour TWA), and 28 \u00b5g/100 mL in blood and 100 \u00b5g/L in urine with a TWA of 0.05 mg/m3. Roels et al. (1987) found a correlation between daily mercury vapor exposure and blood or urine mercury levels in 10 work ers employed for at least 1 year at an alkaline battery plant. The mercury levels in the air and th e pre- or post-workshift levels of blood and urinary mercury correlated well (r=0.79-0.86 [b lood] and r=0.70-0.80 1:0.045:1.22 (mercury in air:blood mercury:urinary mercury), Roels et al. (1987) concluded that exposure to0.05 mg/m 3 mercury vapor would result in a blood mercur y of 2.26 \u00b5g/100 mL and a urinary mercury of 61 \u00b5g/g creatinine. This correlation differed from that reported by Rosenman et al. (1986), possibly because fewer subjects were evaluated and determinati on of mercury vapor concentration by Roels et al. (1987) was based on air sampling collection during 5 consecutive days at 10 different workplaces. Expired air samples have been considered as possibl e biomarkers of exposure for mercury. Following inhalation of metallic mercury vapor, some of the me rcury may be eliminated in the expired air, but excretion from this pathway is negligible 5-7 days af ter exposure (Cherian et al. 1978; Hursh et al. 1976). Thus, expired air as a measure of mercury exposure can only be used soon after short-term exposure to mercury vapor. There is no information on the am ount of mercury in expired air following long-term exposure to mercury.Nonoccupational exposure to mercury includes the u se of mercury-containing products and consumption of mercury-contaminated food. Urine samples from young women using skin-lightening creams containing MERCURY 314 2. HEALTH EFFECTS C'f(d b(V'AD(AB(d b(V5-10% mercuric ammonium chloride had a mean merc ury concentration of 109 \u00b5g/L, compared to 6 \u00b5g/L for urine samples from women who had discontinued use and to 2 \u00b5g/L for women who had never used the creams (Barr et al. 1973). Increased urinary excre tion and blood levels of mercury were observed in volunteers who used phenylmercuric borate solutions or lozenges intended for the treatment of mouth orthroat infections (Lauwerys et al. 1977). Swedes cons uming fish contaminated with 0.3-7 mg Hg/kg (0.3- 7 ppm) had blood cell levels of total mercury ra nging from 8 to 390 ng/g (Skerfving 1974). Long-term exposure to methylmercury at 4 \u00b5g Hg/kg/day was associated with a mercury level in blood cells of approximately 300 ng/g (Skerfving 1974). The steady-st ate concentration of methylmercury in blood may be related to daily intake in the following equation (Task Group on Metal Accumulation 1973; WHO 1990): Where: C = concentration in bloodf = fraction of the daily intake taken up by the bloodd = daily dietary intakeb = elimination constantA D= percent of mercury intake in diet that is absorbed AB= percent of the absorbed amount that enters the blood V = volume of blood in the body Hair is a biomarker of long-term exposure to methylme rcury. Once mercury is incorporated into hair, it remains unchanged (Clarkson et al. 1973; Nielsen and Andersen 1991a, 1991b). A number of studies have examined the level of mercury in hair relative to the amount of fish consumed (see Table 2-10) (Airey 1983b; Sherlo ck et al. 1982). A fairly strong correlation has been demonstrated by these studies between the amount of fish consumed, the level of mercury in the fish, and the level of mercury in hair. Furthermore, the relationship between hair le vels and blood levels has been well studied (see Table 2-9) (Amin Zaki et al. 1976; Den Tonkelaar et al. 1974; Haxton et al. 1979;Kershaw et al. Sherlock et 1982; Skerfving 1974; Soria et al. 1992). A number of studies report that hair mercury levels co rrelate with total intake levels and with organ- specific levels of mercury. Suzuki et al. (1993) analyzed 46 human autopsies in Tokyo, Japan andreported that hair mercury levels were highly significantly correlate d with organ Hg levels in the cerebrum, cerebellum, heart, spleen, liver, kidney co rtex, and kidney medulla, when the total mercury or methyl mercury value in the organ was compared with the hair total mercury or organic mercury, respectively. MERCURY 315 2. HEALTH EFFECTS When the inorganic mercury value was tested, signifi cant correlations remained, with weaker coefficients in all the organs but the spleen. Stepwise multiple re gression analysis indicated that hair organic mercury value was the major correlating variable for the organ total mercury or organ methyl mercury value in all the organs. With respect to the organ inorganic merc ury value, the hair organic mercury value was the major correlate for the cerebrum and kidney (both cort ex and medulla), the hair inorganic mercury value was the major variable for the cerebellum and heart, and the hair phosphorous a nd hair organic mercury were the major variables for the liver. No explan atory variable existed for the spleen. Auxiliary correlating variables accounted for the organ total mercury and inorganic mercury levels, among which the hair selenium value was conspicuous and with negative regression coefficients. Nakagawa (1995) analyzed total mercury in hair samples from 365 volunteers in Tokyo, and reported higher mercury levels in those who preferred fish in their diet, compared to those who preferred other foods (preference choices were fish, fish and meat, m eat, and vegetables). The mean hair mercury levels were 4 ppm in men who preferred fish and 2.7 ppm in women who preferred fish. The lowest hair mercury levels were seen in men and women who pr eferred vegetables, 2.27 and 1.31 ppm, respectively. The mean hair level for the whole group was 2.23 ppm (median 1.98). Drasch et al. (1997) assayed tissue samples of 150 human cadavers (75 males, 75 females) from a \"normal\" European (German) population, i.e., there were no occupational or higher than average exposures to metals found in any of the biographies of the d eceased. The objective was to evaluate the validity of blood, urine, hair, and muscle as biomarkers for intern al burdens of mercury, lead, and cadmium in the general population. All individuals died suddenly and not as a result of chronic ailments. Age ranged from 16 to 93 years, and every decade was represented by approximately 10 males and 10 females. Tissues sampled included kidney cortex, liver, cerebral cortex, cerebellum, petrous portion of the bone (spina iliaca anterior-superior), gluteus), blood (heart blood), urine, and hair (scalp- hair). Statistically significant rank correlations between biomarker levels and tissues were observed but with large confidence intervals for the regressions. The authors conclude that specific biomarkers relativ e to each metal are useful in estimating body burdens and trends in groups, but are not useful for determin ing the body burden (and therefore the health risks) in individuals. A notable exception was, that in compar ison to a generally poor correlation of cadmium, lead, and mercury between hair and tissue, there was a st rong correlation between merc ury in hair and mercury in brain (cerebrum and cerebellum). The authors st ate that this may be due to the high lipophilicity of elemental and short-chain alkyl mercury compounds. As seen in other studies comparing European to MERCURY 316 2. HEALTH EFFECTS Japanese hair mercury levels, the hair levels re ported by Nakagawa (1995) of 2-4 ppm for a Japanese population are 10-20 times higher than levels observed in the Drasch et al. (1997) study (median,0.247 \u00b5g/g in hair; range, 0.43-2.5 \u00b5g/g). Other studies have confirmed a good correlation between hair mercury and brain mercury levels. In a study on the Seychelles Islands cohort, Cernichiari et al. (1995b) compared maternal hair levels, maternal blood levels, fetal blood leve ls, and fetal brain levels. Autopsy br ains were obtained from infants dying from a variety of causes. The concentrations of total mercury in six major regions of the brain were highly correlated with maternal hair levels. This correla tion was confirmed by a sequence of comparisons among the four measures. Maternal hair correlated to ma ternal blood (r=0.82) and infa nt brain level (r=0.6-0.8). Maternal blood correlated to infant blood (r=0.65); and infant blood corre lated to infant brain (r=0.4-0.8). There are potential confounding factors and other f actors to consider when assessing mercury exposure based upon mercury hair levels. Mercury may be de posited to hair from the air when significant sources of mercury are present in the air or when certain hair treatments are used (Hac and Krechniak 1993; WHO 1991). Potential sources of external mercury exposur e should, therefore, be evaluated as part of an exposure assessment. Some studies also report a sex rela ted difference in mercury tissue levels. Nielson et al. (1994) observed a significant sex-related differences in the toxicokinetics of methylmercury in micefollowing administration of a single radiolabeled dose. Drasch et al. (1997) reported that mercury levels in all tissues assayed in their human cadaver study had higher levels compared to male tissues. The difference was significant for the kidney (med ian female kidney me rcury level=92.0 ng/g, males=40.8 ng/g; p=0.002). In blood and urine there was a similar trend. In contrast, the authors report that mercury hair levels in females were signifi cantly lower than in males (median females=205 ng/g, males 285 ng/g; p=0.02). Nakagawa (1995) also re port higher mean mercury hair levels in males (2.98 \u00b5g/g) compared with females (2.02 \u00b5g/g) in a Japanese population. Further research is, therefore, needed to characterize potential sex related differe nce in the toxicokinetics of mercury under different exposure scenarios. Eide and Wesenberg (1993) studied mercury concentra tions in various organs and tissues in rats exposed to mercury vapor for approximately 2 months and proposed that human deciduous teeth may be useful indicators of chronic mercury exposure, as well as indicators of mercury uptake in organs such as thekidneys and the brain.MERCURY 317 2. HEALTH EFFECTS Other potential biomarkers of exposure include rena l dysfunction parameters, neurological effects, and increased urinary porphyrins, and are discussed below in Section 2.7.2. 2.7.2 Biomarkers Used to Characterize Effects Caused by Mercury Several potential biomarkers of effect for mercury have been evaluated, usually for neurological and renal dysfunction. Many of these toxic effects have been correlated with blood and urine levels (see Table 2-13). However, most indicators are nonspecifi c and may have resulted from other influences. As discussed in Section 2.2, many studies have examined the relationship between urine mercury levels and specific renal and neurological effects. Renal dy sfunction has been studied extensively as a potential sensitive measure of mercury exposure. Signs of renal dysfunction at mercury air concentration of 0.1 mg/m3 were reported by Stewart et al. (1977). Case reports have associated the therapeutic use of inorganic mercury salts with the occurrence of nephrotic syndrome (Kazantzis et al. 1962). Several different biomarkers have been evaluate d for assessing renal damage; however, renal parameters are interdependent (Verschoor et al. 1988). Furthermore, these markers are not specific for mercuryexposure and may be a consequence of other concurrent chemical exposures. Markers for renal toxicity may indicate decreased function, cytotoxicity, or biochemical changes (Cardenas et al. 1993). Biomarkersfor decreased function include increases in urinary proteins and elevation of serum creatinine or 2-microglobulin. Biomarkers renal cytotoxicity include increases in urinary excretion of antigens and enzymes located within renal tissues. Biomarkers for biochemical changes occurring within the kidneys include eicosanoids, fibronectin, kallikrein activity, and glycosaminoglycans in urine. Glomerular changes resulting from mercury exposure have predominantly been reported as increases in high-molecular weight proteinuria (Buchet et al. Stonard et al. 1983; Tubbs et al. 1982). Renal tubular changes in workers exposed to merc ury include increased urinary excretion of N-acetyl- -D-glucosaminidase (NAG), 1988; Langworth et al. 1992b; Rosenman et al. 1986). Elevated urinary NAG levels occurred with urinarymercury levels of 100-250 \u00b5g/L in a study populati on of mixed ethnic background (Rosenman et al. 1986), with urinary levels of 35 \u00b5g/g creatinine in chlo ralkali workers \u00b5g/g creatinine in chloralkali workers urinary mercury levels >50 \u00b5g/g creatinine in another group of chloralkali workers (Cardenas et al. 1993). NAG levels were not affected in chloralkali workers with urinary mercury levels of 15 \u00b5g/g creatinine (Piikivi and Ruokonen 1989). No significant increase of proteinur ia, albuminuria, and other indicators of renal MERCURY 320 2. HEALTH EFFECTS dysfunction was evident in 62 mercury workers with average blood mercury levels of 1.6 \u00b5g/100 mL (range, 0.25-7.56 \u00b5g/100 mL) and average urine mercur \u00b5g/g creatinine (range, 3-272 (Lauwerys nother renal parameter evaluated is -microglobulin, which has a normal range of 0.004-0.37 mg/L (Naleway et al. 1991) . No statistically significant relationship was found between urinary -microglobulin levels and elevated urinar y mercury concentrations (Ehrenberg et al. 1991; Naleway et al. 1991). Examination of a wide range of biomarkers for renal toxicity in a group of chloralkali workers identified several other changes at low urinary mercury levels (Cardenas et al. 1993). Workers with urinary mercury levels in the range of 5-50 \u00b5g/g creatinine statistically significant increases in urinary Tamm-Horsfall glycoprotein (loca lized in the epithelial cells convoluted tubules) and decreases in urinary prostaglandins E2 and F2 . In workers with border B2, andglycosaminoglycans were also which are intermediates in the biosynthesis of heme, may be another potential biomarker of eff ect for mercury exposure. A correlation was observed between urinary mercury and urinary coproporphyrin (W ada et al. 1969). Correlations were also observed for decreases in -aminolevulinic acid-dehydratase and cholin esterase activity with increases in urinary mercury. Porphyrins are considered a nonspecific measu re of effect because they are influenced by other metal exposures. Woods et al. (1991) present data s uggesting that there is a specific urinary porphyrin profile that may serve as a biomarker of mercury accumulation in the kidneys during prolonged inorganic and organic mercury exposure. A urinary porphyrin pattern, characterized by elevated coproporphyrin, pentacarboxyl porphyrin, and precoproporphyrin, for me thylmercury hydroxide exposure was observed in mice for up to 30 weeks. This profile is observed at variable dose levels, as well as up to at least 40 weeks after cessation of exposure. The time course of the profile during prolonged treatment is closely associatedwith divalent inorganic mercury (Hg +2), suggesting that the effects are mediated by this cation because it inhibits the heme pathway (Woods et al. 1991). Sp ecificity may be a problem unless the porphyrin levels are analyzed at the same time as urinary mercury measurements. The neurophysiological and neuropsychological health eff ects of mercury have been extensively studied in occupationally exposed individuals in an effort to m onitor body levels and to determine a threshold value below which these effects are unlikely to occur. As with other biomarkers of effect, neurological changes induced by mercury may resemble exposure to other chemicals that can cause damage to the brain. Case studies have associated exposure to mercury vapor with neurological effects (e.g., tremors, insomnia, shyness, emotional instability, decreased motor func tion and muscle reflexes, headaches, and abnormalMERCURY 321 2. HEALTH EFFECTS EEGs) (Davis et al. 1974; Jaffe et al. 1983; McFarla nd and Reigel 1978). Some studies have examined the relationship between nerve function and mercury levels in blood, urin e, and tissue. Tissue levels of mercury have also been found to correlate with impa ired nerve function. Among 23 dentists with mercury levels greater than 20 \u00b5g/g (measured in wrist ti ssue), 30% exhibited reduced nerve conduction velocity when compared with dentists with tissue levels of mercury below 20 \u00b5g/g (Shapiro et al. 1982). The decrease in nerve conduction velocity was observed in both sensory and motor nerves. A dose-response relationship has also been reporte d for the association between paresthesia and blood mercury concentrations in an Iraqi population exposed to methylmercury. At a blood mercury level of 24 \u00b5g/100 mL 65 days after cessation of exposure, the incidence of paresthesia caused by methylmercuryrose significantly (Clarkson et al. 1976). Below this concentration, any incidence of paresthesia was assumed to be related to other causes, according to th e investigators. As a result of the reported blood mercury half-life of 65 days in this population, the maximum blood mercury concentration was likely to have been 48 \u00b5g/100 mL at the end of the exposure. Some evidence of paresthesia, sensory impairment, general ataxia, and visual field effects in expo sed Swedes was reported; however, no significant increases in occurrence were found in Swedes with high le vels of mercury in blood cells (82-1,100 ng/g) as compared to Swedes with lower blood cell mercury levels (12-75 ng/g) (Skerfving 1974). The study did not include a matched control group. Many possible biomarkers of effect for mercury e xposure have been correlated with urinary mercury levels. Workers exposed to elemental mercury vapor with urinary mercury excretion levels ranging from 7 to 1,101 \u00b5g/day exhibited significantly reduced tibia l nerve velocity and increased median nerve latency in both motor and sensory nerves as compared with controls (Vroom and Greer 1972). Prolonged motor and sensory nerve latency was also associated with urine mercury levels ranging from 20 to 450 \u00b5g/L in 18 male workers exposed to elemental mercury vapor at a mercury cell chlorine plant (Levine et al. 1982). Urine mercury levels exceeding 200 \u00b5g/L have been re ported to be associated with tremors and poor eye- hand coordination (Williamson et al. 1982). Twelve wo rkers chronically exposed to elemental mercury vapor had urinary mercury levels ranging from <10 to 670 \u00b5g/L. A significant relationship between urine mercury and hand steadiness was reported. Increased tremor frequency, increased reaction time, andreduced eye-hand coordination were observed as urin e mercury levels increased from 5 to 1,000 \u00b5g/L in 77 exposed individuals (Miller et al. 1975). A weak but significant quantitative relationship between urine mercury levels and finger tremors was elucidated by Verberk et al. (1986). The relationship between acceleration of finger tremors and excretion of mercury in the urine of 20 workers exposed to metallicMERCURY 322 2. HEALTH EFFECTS mercury was expressed by the equation 10 log (acceleration)= G0.888 + 0.0059 (urine mercury) (r=0.39, p<0.05, n=20). Tremors have also been reporte d in 567 workers from chloralkali production facilities whose blood mercury levels ranged from <1 to >10 \u00b5g/100 mL and whose urine mercury levels ranged from <10 to >1,000 \u00b5g/L. Increased tremors and re duced eye-hand coordination were associated with blood mercury levels of 1-2 \u00b5g/100 mL and urine merc ury levels of 50-100 \u00b5g/g creatinine (Smith et al. 1970). Cavalleri et al. (1995) have suggested that exposure to elemental mercury vapors at levels producing urine mercury concentrations >50 \u00b5g/g cr eatinine can cause a dose-related loss of color vision. An association between urine mercury levels and performance on memory tests and verbal intelligence tests has been established. Abnormal results on me mory tests were reported for 9 workers exposed to mercury in the production of thermometers; urinar y mercury excretion leve ls were 7-1,101 \u00b5g/24 hours (Vroom and Greer 1972). The short-term memory span of 26 workers was examined by Smith et al.(1983) and found to decrease with increasing urine merc ury levels. The range of mercury found in the urine of these workers was 0-510 \u00b5g/L. A significant linear relationship was reported between subjects'50% memory threshold spans and 12-month urinary mercury concentrations. Disturbances on tests of verbal intelligence and memory were more frequent among individuals with mercury blood levels above 1.5 \u00b5g/100 mL and mercury urine levels above 56 \u00b5g/L in 36 male chloralkali workers (Piikivi et al. 1984). Potential biomarkers for the autoimmune effects of mercury include measurement of antiglomerular basement membrane antibodies, anti-DNA antibodies, serum IgE complexes, and total IgE (Cardenas et al. 1993). Elevated IgE, antiglomerular basement me mbrane antibodies, and anti-DNA antibodies have been observed in a few persons with exposure to mercury from dental amalgams (Anneroth et al. 1992). Other individuals have also been shown to have el evated anti-DNA or antiglomerular basement membrane antibodies (Cardenas et al. 1993; Langworth et al. 1992b). Recent data regarding the action of low-level me rcury exposure on receptors and signal transduction pathways in peripheral lymphocytes suggest potentia l applications of certain surrogate markers in mechanistic studies of neurotoxicity and, possibly, in assessing early biochemical effects of neurotoxicantsin humans (Manzo et al. 1995). Additional biomarke rs for effects on the immune, renal, hepatic, and neurological systems are presented in the CDC/ATSDR (1990) and OTA (1990) reports. See Section 2.2for a more detailed discussion of the effects caused by mercury.MERCURY 323 2. HEALTH EFFECTS 2.8 INTERACTIONS WITH OTHER CHEMICALS As with many other metals, both toxic and nontoxic, inte rrelationships exist that can influence and alter the absorption, distribution, excretion, and toxicity of one or more of the component metals. For example, the zinc status of an individual can affect mercury toxic ity. Pretreatment with zinc provides some protection from the nephrotoxic effects of inorganic mercury in rats (Zalups and Cherian 1992). The data indicate that zinc-induced metallothionein binds mercury in the renal cortex and shifts the distribution of mercury from its site of toxicity at the epithelial cells of th e proximal tubules. Thus, the renal content of mercury is increased, yet less is available to cause toxicity. In c ontrast, the renal toxicity of mercuric chloride is exacerbated in zinc-deficient animals (Fukino et al. 1992). In the zinc-deficient state, less mercury accumulates in the kidneys, but the toxicity is greater. The mechanism of the protection appears to involvemore than simply a redistribution of renal mercury, because in the absence of mercury exposure, zincdeficiency increases renal oxidative stress (increased lipid peroxidation, decreased reduced ascorbate). When mercury exposure occurs, the oxidative str ess is compounded (increased lipid peroxidation and decreased glutathione and glutathione peroxidase). Thus , zinc appears to affect the biochemical protective mechanisms in the kidneys as well. Similarly, in most studies, the simultaneous administration of mercury and selenium in equimolar doses to animals has resulted in decreased toxicity of both el ements in acute and chronic exposure studies. This effect has been observed with inorganic and organi c mercury and with either inorganic or organic selenium compounds, although inorganic forms of seleniu m appear to be more effective than organic forms (Chang 1983; Skerfving 1978). Selenium protects against the acute nephrotoxicity of the mercuric ion and the methylmercuric ion in (Ganther 1980; and and possibly against acu te neurotoxicity of methylmercuric ion in rats (Ohi et al. 1980). The protective effect of sel enium has been associated with a higher whole-body retention of mercury rather than with increased mercury excretion (Hansen 1988; Magos et al. 1987). Mercury-selenium complexes are form ed when these chemicals are co-administered. Mercuric mercury forms a complex with selenium and a high-molecular weight protein (Naganuma and Imura 1981). Methylmercury forms a bismethyl-mercury selenide complex. Although the specific mechanism for the protection is not well understood, possible mechanisms for selenium's protective effect includeredistribution of mercury (Mengel and Karlog 1980), competition by selenium for mercury-binding sites associated with toxicity, formation of a mercury- selenium complex that diverts mercury from sensitive targets (Hansen 1988; Magos et al. 1987; Naganum a and Imura 1981), and prevention of oxidative damage by increasingMERCURY 324 2. HEALTH EFFECTS selenium Weiner 1991). Selenium-treated animals can remain unaffected despite an accumulation of mercury in tissues to levels that are otherwise associated with toxic effects (Skerfving 1978). Support for the proposal that an inert complex is formed comes from the 1:1 ratio of selenium and mercury found in the livers of marine mammals and in the bodies of experimental animals administered compounds of mercury and compounds of selenium, regardless of the ratio of theinjected doses (Hansen 1988). Mercuric mercury has b een shown to form a complex with selenium and a high-molecular weight protein (Naganuma and Imura 1981). Methylmercury forms a bismethyl-mercuryselenide complex. Although the fetotoxicity of methylmercuric chloride h as been shown to be enhanced by the feeding of a selenium-deficient diet in mice (Nishikido et al. 1987), additional selenium administration does notappear to protect against teratogenic effects (i.e., cl eft palate) of methylmercuric chloride in mice (Lee et al. 1979). High doses of selenium administered as selenite for 30 days prior to gestation and throughGd 18 to mice fed a diet containing high doses of methyl mercuric chloride increased the incidence of cleft palate (Nobunaga et al. 1979). It is possible that clef t palate induction by methylmercury is the result of a suppression of growth rather than a tissue-specific te ratogenic action (Lee et al. 1979). If this were the case, high doses of selenium that inhibit growth could potentiate the induction of cleft palate by methyl- mercury administration. Further discussion of selen ium-mercury interactions can be found in Section 2.3.1.2. Ethanol promotes an increase in the respiratory excretion of metallic mercury by inhibiting the enzyme catalase, which is responsible for oxidizing metallic mercury to mercuric mercury. This process was shown in workers who ingested a moderate dose of alcohol and experienced a 50% decrease in mercury retention upon inhalation exposure to metallic mercury vapor (Nie lsen-Kudsk 1973). Also, ethanol increased the amount of mercury exhaled by people w ho inhaled metallic mercury vapor or received trace doses of mercuric chloride (Nielsen-Kudsk 1965). Th erefore, less mercury should reach the kidneys and less renal toxicity should be observed (Nielsen-Kuds k 1965). However, ethanol also allows elemental mercury to persist longer in the plasma, resulting in prolonged diffusion of elemental mercury throughout the body (Nielsen-Kudsk 1965). Therefore, ethanol can cause mercury to distribute more easily acrossthe blood-brain barrier and the placenta, thereby increasing the risk of mercury toxicity to the brain andthe developing fetus. In addition, the oxidation of ethanol with concurrent NADPH generation enhancesMERCURY 325 2. HEALTH EFFECTS the reduction of the mercuric ion to metallic mercur y, thereby making it more favorable for permeating the placenta (Khayat and Dencker 1982). Ethanol also potentiates the toxicity methylmercury (Rumbeiha et al. 1992; Tamashiro et al. 1986;Turner et al. 1981). Studies in animals have shown increased mortality (Tamashiro et al. 1986), increasedseverity and decreased time to onset of neurotoxicity (hind-limb ataxia) (Tamashiro et al. 1986; Turner et al. 1981), and increased renal toxicity (increased he maturia, renal weight, blood urea nitrogen, and oliguria) (Rumbeiha et al. 1992; Tamashiro et al. 1986) when methylmercury exposure occurredconcomitant with ethanol ingestion. Although incr eased mercury concentrations were observed in the brain and kidneys, the changes in mercury content were insufficient to fully explain the observed potentiation of toxicity (Tamashiro et al. 1986), suggesting that ethanol may enhance the toxic mechanisms of methylmercury. The mechanism for this enhancement is unknown. Atrazine and potassium dichromate have also been de monstrated to enhance the toxicity of inorganic mercury. Administration of atrazine, a widely used herbicide, with methylmercury in the diet resulted in a higher deposition of mercury in the liver and an ear lier onset of neurotoxicity (Meydani and Hathcock 1984). The mechanism underlying this interaction was unclear. Parenteral administration of minimally toxic doses of potassium dichromate and mercuric chlori de resulted in a synergistic inhibition of the renal transport of organic ions p-aminohippurate and tetraethylammoni um (Baggett and Berndt 1984). Although the mechanism underlying this interaction was not examined, it may be associated with the fact that both mercury and potassium dichromate are both toxic to the renal proximal tubule (Biber et al.1968). Agents that deplete nonprotein sulfhydryls may increase the toxicity of mercury. Depletion of glutathione levels with diethylmaleate in rats resu lted in greatly increased renal toxicity of mercury chloride (Girardi and Elias 1991). Greater decreases in glomerular filtration and increases in fractionalexcretion of sodium and lithium, urinary -glutamyltransferase, and lipid peroxidation were observed. Conversely, chemicals that protect against oxidative damage may decrease the toxic effects of mercury. Increased survival and decreased toxicity were observed in rats given vitamin E ( -tocopherol) during treatment with methylmercury (Welsh 1979). It is probable that the mechanism for the protection involved the antioxidant properties of vitamin E. The exogenous application of the monothiols glutat hione or its, precursor N-acetyl-DL-homocysteine thiolactone (NAHT), or E vitamins to mice exposed to methylmercuric chloride injectedMERCURY 326 2. HEALTH EFFECTS at dosages of 1 mg/kg/day was reported by Bapu et al. (1994). Therapy with both B-complex vitamins and vitamin E was found to mobilize a significant am ount of mercury from all tissues examined (brain, spinal cord, liver, and kidneys), with the maximu m mobilization (about 63%, compared with controls) being recorded in the spinal cord following v itamin E treatment. NAHT treatment also produced significant mobilization of mercury from nervous tissu e but caused an increase in mercury concentration in non-nervous tissue. Another group of compounds that combines with mercur y (and other divalent cation species) is comprised by those used in chelation therapy to reduce the body burden of mercury by enhancing its elimination from the body. Such chelators include: and N-acetylpenicillamine (NAP). While these chelating agents have a very high affinity for Hg++, which makes them effective mercury chelat ors, they also have an affinity for other divalent cations, many of which are essential for normal physiological function. BAL was the first chelating agent used for mercury toxi city, and it is still widely used today for inorganic mercury poisoning (ATSDR 1992). BAL is also belie ved to be effective in treating phenylmercury poisoning, because of the rapid in vivo oxidization of phenylmercuric acetate to Hg++, thereby rendering phenylmercury similar in behavior to i norganic mercury. BAL is contraindicated for cases of methyl- mercury poisoning, however, because it has been demons trated to increase the concentration of methyl- mercury in the brain. Possible side effects of BAL include nausea, vomiting, headache, tachycardia, fever, conjunctivitis, blepharospasm, and lacrimation. As an adjunct or alternative to parenterally administered BAL, oral NAP may be used (ATSDR 1992). Side effects of NAP may include fever, rash,leukopenia, eosinophilia, and thrombocytopenia. DMPS and DMSA are derivatives of BAL, but they ha ve been found to be more effective than BAL in experimental studies. Although still considered an investigational drug, DMPS decreased the mercury excretion half-life from 33.1 to 11.2 days in 2 work ers exposed to high levels of mercury vapor (ATSDR 1992). In a study of the influence of DMPS and DMSA on renal deposition of mercury in rats, both chelating agents were found to cause a significantly increased urinary excretion of mercury (Zalups 1993), although significant differences in the extrarenal handling of these two chelators were found. DMPS was also shown to increase the urinary excre tion of mercury 7.6-fold in a group of former chloralkali workers MERCURY 327 2. HEALTH EFFECTS 3 years after cessation of occupational exposure (Salls ten et al. 1994), probably reflecting the excretion of mercury stored in the kidneys. In a case report of two human mercury vapor intoxication incidents, treatment with BAL followed by DMSA was found to decrease plasma inorganic mercury uptake atconcentrations <50 \u00b5g/L. However, relatively high concentrations of mercury remained in the plasma for a very long time, possibly due to the progressive re lease of mercury from red blood cells and tissues after oxidation. EDTA and EGTA also effectively form complexes with Hg ++, and enhance its excretion from the body, in what is typically considered a relatively benign or biologically inert fashion. In a study using human brain homogenates from autopsy samples from apparently healthy brains, Duhr et al. (1993) demonstrated that not only is the inhibition of microtubule polymerization and the disruption of already-formedmicrotubules not prevented by the additi on of EDTA and EGTA (which bind Hg ++ with very high affinity) but, to the contrary, these two chelating agents potentiate the Hg++-induced inhibition of tubulin polymerization. further re ported that the mercury-EDTA and mercury-EGTA complexes cause the inhibition of tubulin polymerization by disrupting the interaction of GTP with theE-site of brain beta-tubulin, an obligatory step in the polymerization of tubulin. 2.9 POPULATIONS THAT ARE UNUSUALLY SUSCEPTIBLE A susceptible population will exhibit a different or e nhanced response to mercury than will most people exposed to the same level of mercury in the environment. Reasons include genetic makeup, developmental stage, age, health and nutritional status (including dietary habits that may increase susceptibility, such as inconsistent diets or nutriti onal deficiencies), and substance exposure history (including smoking). These parameters result in decr eased function of the detoxification and excretory processes (mainly hepatic, renal, and respiratory) or the pre-existing compromised function of target organs (including effects on clearance rates and any resulting end-product metabolites). Populations more susceptible to the toxic effects of mercury than a healthy young adult include: the elderly because of declining organ function, higher leve ls of persistent heavy metals (e.g., cadmium) that also accumulate in the kidney, and potentially higher brain to liver or kidney mercury concentrations; people with pre- existing disease (e.g., renal or neurological disease); and the youngest of the population because of theirimmature and developing organs. Populations at greater risk due to unusually high exposure are discussed in Section 5.7 (Populations With Potentially High Exposure).MERCURY 328 2. HEALTH EFFECTS Probably the most widely recognized form of hypersensitivity to mercury is the occurrence of acrodynia, or pink disease, in persons exposed to mercury. Acr odynia is characterized by itching, flushing, swelling, and/or desquamation of the palms of the hands or soles of the feet, morbilliform rashes, excessivesweating and/or salivation, tachycardia, elevat ed blood pressure, insomnia, weakness, irritability, fretfulness, and peripheral sensory disturbances (Warkany and Hubbard 1953). The occurrence of acrodynia was determined to be an idiosyncratic reaction to mercury exposure. Despite widespread exposure of children to mercury-containing laxatives, antiascariasis medications, and teething powders in the 1940s and 1950s, only a few children developed acrody nia. The affected population was not the most highly exposed; numerous reports identified higher e xposures in others with no evidence of the disease. The physiological basis for this hypersensitivity is unknown, but patch testing indicated that it is not an allergic response to mercury exposure. Animal studies (Aten et al. 1992; Druet et 1990; Roman-Franco et al.1978; van der Meide et al. 1993) and limited human da ta (Lindqvist et al. 1974; Tubbs et al. 1982) also indicate that there may be persons with a genetic predisposition to develop an autoimmune glomerulo- nephritis upon exposure to mercury. In this form of renal toxicity, proteinuria is observed following the reaction of autoantibodies with renal tissues and depos ition of immune material (i.e., IgG and complement C3) in the renal mesangium and glomerular blood vessel s. Both susceptible and resistant mouse and rat strains have been identified, and susceptibility a ppears to be governed by both MHC genes and nonMHC genes (Aten et 1985; Sapin et al. 1984). Unborn children are another known susceptible population to the toxic effects of mercury (see Section 2.2.2.4). Data from large-scale poisonings in Japan (Harada 1978) and Iraq (Marsh et al. 1987) indicate that infants exposed in utero to alkyl mercury compounds developed severe neurological toxicity whereas their mothers may have experienced no or only m ild toxicity. This difference may be due to methylmercury binding to tubulin (Vogel et al. 1985, 1989) and the role of microtubules in neuronal cell division and migration in the developing nervous system (Sager et al. 1982). There is evidence indicating that the developing male fetus may be more susceptible to methylmercury exposure than the female fetus (Buelke-Sam et al. 1985; Grant-Webster et al. 1992; Sager et al. 1984).MERCURY 329 2. HEALTH EFFECTS Neonates may also be especially susceptible to mercur y toxicity. Both inorganic and organic forms of mercury are excreted in the milk (Sundberg and Oskarsson 1992; Yoshida et al. 1992). Furthermore,suckling rats exhibit a very high absorption of inor ganic mercury as a percentage of the diet (30-40%) compared to adult rats, which absorb approximately 1% of the inorganic mercury from the diet (Kostial et al. 1978). The highest oral toxicity to inorganic mercury as expressed by the LD 50 was for 2-week-old rats; by 3-6 weeks of age, rats showed a dramatic drop in sensitivity to inorganic mercury poisoning (Kostial et al. 1978). The transfer of mercury to su ckling rats through milk was found to result in greater concentrations of the metal in the brains of th e offspring than in the mother (Yang et al. 1973). Developmental neurotoxicity, similar to that seen with in utero exposure, has been observed in an infant exposed to alkyl mercury only after birth (Engleson and Herner 1952). Individuals with diseases of the liver, kidneys, lungs, a nd nerves are considered to be at greater risk of suffering from the toxic effects of both organic and inorganic mercury. Individuals with a dietary insufficiency of zinc, glutathione, antioxidants, or selenium or those who are malnourished may be moresusceptible to the toxic effects of mercury poisoning because of the diminished ability of these substances to protect against mercury toxicity (see Section 2.8). 2.10 METHODS FOR REDUCING TOXIC EFFECTS This section describes clinical practice and research concerning methods for reducing toxic effects of exposure to mercury. However, because some of the treatments discussed may be experimental and unproven, this section should not be used as a guide for the treatment of exposures to mercury. When specific exposures have occurred, poison control cente rs and medical toxicologists should be consulted for medical advice. Although there are a number of treatments currently available, none are completely satisfactory and additional development of treatment drugs and protocols is needed. The recent death of a researcherpoisoned with dimethylmercury is a case in point (Niere nberg et al 1998; Toribara et al. 1997). In spite of prompt action and excellent medical care and monitoring, the clinical course in this patient continued to decline, and ultimately ended in death. In general, even the inorganic mercurials, that are considered to be more easily chelated, are difficult to remove from the body and are not treated without so me side effects. Infants and young children areMERCURY 330 2. HEALTH EFFECTS particularly difficult to treat, sometimes requiring excha nge transfusion or other more elaborate measures. Reducing the body burden or toxic effects of merc ury in pregnant women presents an even greater challenge (i.e., treatment must be effective for bot h the mother and the developing child), and specific treatment protocols are needed. 2.10.1 Reducing Peak Absorption Following Exposure Strategies used to reduce absorption of mercury ma y differ depending on the route of exposure and the specific chemical to which one is exposed. Elementa l mercury and certain organic forms of mercury have high vapor pressures and are readily absorbed by the lungs; inhalation of these chemicals may be themajor exposure of concern. Because ingestion of most chemical forms of mercury is possible, strategiesfor limiting absorption from the gastrointestinal tract woul d be of utmost concern in such situations. The organic mercury compounds have greater absorption fro m the gut than elemental and inorganic mercury; thus, strategies differ depending on the form of mercury ingested. Dermal absorption of the various forms of mercury is also possible, so strategies should also consider limiting dermal absorption. The first step in mitigating the toxic effects of inhalation and dermal exposures to mercury or its compounds is removal from the contaminated area or source (Bronstein and Currance 1988; Gossel 1990; Stutz and Janusz 1988). Since continued exposure may occur when clothing is contaminated, clothing ma y be removed as well (Bronstein and Currance 1988; Stutz and Janusz 1988). If dermal or ocular exposur e has occurred, thoroughly washing the exposed areas with water has been suggested; treatment protocol s recommend the use of Tincture of Green\u00ae soap a disinfectant) for the skin and normal saline for th e eyes (Bronstein and Currance 1988; Stutz and Janusz 1988). Several treatments have been suggested to reduce ab sorption of mercury from the gastrointestinal tract; however, most refer to the inorganic forms of mercury. It is likely that strategies that are effective in reducing the absorption of inorganic forms may also have some efficacy for organic forms. Several procedures that have been recommended for trapping merc ury in the gastrointestinal tract are based on the mercury's affinity for binding to sulfhydryl groups. For example, oral administration of a protein solution(e.g., milk or egg whites) has been suggested to reduce absorption (Gossel and Bricker 1984; Haddad and Winchester 1990; Stutz 1988). Salt-poor albumin administration has also suggested(Haddad and Winchester 1990). Nona bsorbable agents (e.g., polystyre ne resins containing sulfhydrylMERCURY 331 2. HEALTH EFFECTS groups) have been used to decrease the absorption rate of methylmercury (Clarkson et al. 1973). The oral administration of activated charcoal has also been suggested (Gossel and Bricker 1984; Stutz and Janusz 1988). Rapid removal of mercury from the gastrointestinal tract may be indicated in some acute, high-dose situations. In such situations, immediate emesi s or gastric lavage has been suggested (Goldfrank et al. 1990; Haddad and Winchester 1990). Inclusion of salt-poor albumin or sodium formaldehyde sulfoxylate in the lavage fluid to convert the merc uric ion into the less soluble mercurous ion in the stomach has also been recommended (Haddad and Winchester 1990). Emesis is contraindicatedfollowing the ingestion of mercuric oxide, presumably because of the risk of damage to the esophagus as the potentially caustic compound is ejected. A salin e cathartic, such as magnesium sulfate, to speed removal from the gastrointestinal tract has also been recommended unless diarrhea has already begun (Haddad and Winchester 1990; Stutz and Janusz 1988). Giving CaNa2-EDTA is contraindicated because it binds poorly to mercury, may be toxic to the kidneys, chelates other essential minerals, and may cause redistribution of mercury in the body (Gossel and Bricker 1984). 2.10.2 Reducing Body Burden Since the main source of mercury exposure for the general public is organic mercury in the diet, minimizing the consumption of mercury-laden fish a nd shellfish is an effective means of reducing the body burden. The amount of inhaled mercury vapor from accidental spills of metallic mercury (e.g., from broken thermometers or electrical switches) can be minimized by informing the general public of the potential dangers and volatility of liquid mercury, a nd by prompt and thorough clean-up of liquid mercury spills. Following exposure and absorption, metallic mercury is distributed primarily to the kidneys. Elemental mercury is highly soluble in lipids and easily crosses cell membranes (Gossel and Bricker 1984),particularly those of the alveoli (Florentine and Sanfilippo 1991). Once in the blood, this form ofmercury can distribute throughout the body, as well as penetrate the blood-brain barrier, thusaccumulating in the brain (Berlin et al. 1969). The body burden half-life of metallic mercury is about 1-2 months (Clarkson 1989). The kidney is also the primary organ of accumulation for compounds of inorganic mercury, but the liver, spleen, bone marrow, red blood cells, intestine, and respiratory mucosa are target tissues as well (Haddad and Winchester 1990; Rothstein and Hayes 1964). Inorganic mercury is excreted primarily through the kidneys; its hal f-life ranges from 42-60 days (Hursh et al. 1976; Rahola et al. 1973). As with elemental mercury, or ganic mercury compounds accumulate throughout the body (Aberg et al. 1969; Miettinen 1973). Accumulation of organic mercury also occurs in the liver, where itMERCURY 332 2. HEALTH EFFECTS is metabolized, excreted through the bile, and often reab tinal tract (Florentine and Sanfilippo 1991; Haddad and Winchester 1990). The ha lf-life of lower alkyl mercurials is about 70-79 days (Aberg al. For several years, diaphoresis (excretion through pe rspiration) was used to lower the body burden of mercury in miners exposed to mercury vapors (Sunde rman 1978). Recently, this method of therapy has also been used to lower tissue levels of mercur y in a patient exposed to metallic mercury in the manufacture of thermometers (Sunderman 1978).Chelation therapy is presently the treatment of choice for reducing the body burden of mercury. There are currently a number of chelators that are eith er in practical use or under investigation in in vivo and in vitro studies (Florentine and Sanfilippo 1991; Gossel and Bricker 1984; Haddad and Winchester 1990). These chelators differ in their efficacy for various forms of mercury, routes of administration, side effects, and routes of excretion. Depending on the chemical to which one has been exposed and the health status of the individual, different chelators may be indicated. One popularly used chelator, dimercaprol or BAL,has two sulfhydryl groups that can bind mercury a nd compete with its binding to sulfhydryl groups in body tissues (Florentine and Sanfilippo 1991; Haddad a nd Winchester 1990). BAL is one of the more effective chelators for inorganic mercury salts. BAL is administered intramuscularly and is the preferred chelator when oral dosing is (F lorentine and Sanfilippo 1991; Gossel and Bricker 1984; Haddad and Winchester 1990). Approximately 50% of the dimercaprol-mercury complex is excreted through the kidneys, while the remainder is eliminated in the bile and feces. Thus, this chelator is preferred when renal impairment has occurred. BAL therapy, however, has several limitations. Significant reabsorption of mercury from the bile occurs (Shimada et al. 1993). Also, multiple toxic sideeffects including urticaria, elevated blood pressure and heart rate, nausea and vomiting, headache,conjunctivitis, lacrimation, and paresthesias have b een reported (Goldfrank et al. 1990). Children may develop fevers, and individuals w ith a glucose-6-phosphatase deficiency may develop hemolysis. BAL treatment is contraindicated for elemental and organic mercury compounds because it has been shown to increase brain levels of mercury in animal studies when used to treat exposures to phenylmercury or methoxyethylmercury compounds (Berlin 1986; Berlin and Rylander 1964) or elemental mercury vapor (Goldfrank et al. 1990), indicating the possibility of increased neurotoxicity. Another currently used mercury chelator is D-penicillamine. This drug has been used somewhat effectively to reduce the toxicity of elemental and inor ganic mercury exposures. It can be taken orally, and its MERCURY 333 2. HEALTH EFFECTS metabolism is slight in humans. Penicillamine is removed though the kidneys (Florentine and Sanfilippo 1991). However, acute allergic reactions to pe nicillamine may occur (Goldfrank et al. 1990). An experimental drug, N-acetyl- D,L-penicillamine (NAP), is very simila r to its analog, penicillamine, in its properties of absorption, metabolism, and excreti on; however, it may be more mercury-specific in its chelating abilities and less toxic (Goldfrank et al. 1990; Haddad and Winchester 1990). A high successrate (88%) has been reported by investigators using NAP to treat victims of mercury inhalation (Florentine and Sanfilippo 1991). 2,3-Dimercaptosuccoinic acid (DMSA), an analogue of BAL, is another experimental chelating agent. DMSA can be given orally and is primarily excreted through the kidneys (Aposhian et al. 1992b). It has been shown to be an effective chelator for both i norganic and methylmercury (Magos 1967). Comparative studies have demonstrated that DMSA is as effective, if not more so, as dimercaprol, penicillamine, and NAP. Data also suggest that this chelating drug pr oduces fewer adverse effects than NAP (Florentine and Sanfilippo 1991). 2,3-Dimercaptopropane -1-sulfonate (DMPS) is another BAL analogue that is an orally effective chelator for mercury. Reports differ w ith respect to which of these analogues is less toxic (Ellenhorn and Barceloux 1990; Jones 1991; Karagacin and Kostial 1991). Better results were obtained in rats with DMPS than with DMSA when the chelating agent was administered at least 24 hours following exposure to mercuric chloride . However, early oral administration of DMPS (within 24 hours) resulted in increased mercury rete ntion (Karagacin and Kostial 1991). In contrast, DMSA resulted in decreased mercury retention irrespective of when it was administered. Hemodialysis with infusion of a chelator (cysteine, N-acetylcysteine, NAP) has been reported to be effective in some severe cases of poisoning where rena l failure is a complication (Berlin 1986; Goldfrank et al. 1990; Haddad and Winchester 1990). It has b een reported to be adva ntageous to begin the hemodialysis before substan tial renal damage has occurred (Haddad and Winchester 1990). Because methylmercury undergoes enterohepatic recircul ation, nonabsorbable agents \"trap\" methylmercury excreted into the bile (Lund et al. 1984). A polystyrene resin containing sulfhydryl groups added to food at a concentration of 1% doubled the elimination rate of methylmercuric chloride when administered to mice. The elimination half- life decreased from 65 to 20 days (Clarkson et al. 1973). Excretion of methylmercury may also be enhanced by bile drainage either through catheterization and drainage of the choledochal duct or by surgical establishment of gallbladder drainage (Berlin 1986). However, this method has not been used therapeutically.MERCURY 334 2. HEALTH EFFECTS 2.10.3 Interfering with the Mechanism of Action for Toxic Effects The majority of metallic mercury vapor and organic mercury absorbed by the body is rapidly oxidized to the more toxic and soluble mercuric ion in th e blood and tissues through a hydrogen peroxide catalase pathway (Clarkson 1989; Halbach and Cl arkson 1978). It is believed that the high affinity of the cation for protein-containing sulfhydryl or thiol groups is the underlying mechanism for the biological activity of mercury (Clarkson 1972a; Hughes 1957; Passow et al. 1961). In a process that is not yet completelyunderstood, mercury disrupts the intracellular sulfhydr yl status, resulting in oxidative stress, followed by activation of catabolic enzymes (i.e., proteases, e ndonucleases), and ultimately in cellular injury (Verity and Sarafian 1991). Treatment with agents that reduce oxygen radical-producing reactions may be effective in reducing mercury-induced oxidative cell da mage. For example, pretreatment of rats with deferoxamine, a potent iron chelator and inhibitor of iron-catalyzed oxygen radical-producing reactions, reduced the increase in reactive oxygen species seen in the cerebellum after methylmercury exposure (LeBel et al. 1992; Sarafian and Verity 1991). Similarly, treatment with N-acetylcysteine, an antioxidant, resulted in increased survival time and less severe lung lesions in rats following exposure to mercury vapor (Livardjani et al. 1991b). Vitamin E (alpha tocopherol) and N,N'-diphenyl- p-phenylenediamine therapy have antioxidant effects and have been shown to be effective in protecting against methylmercury-induced toxicity (Ganther 1980; Welsh 1979). Strategies to block the oxidation of elemental merc ury to mercuric ion through the hydrogen peroxide catalase pathway do not appear to be a viable met hod for mitigating the effects of mercury exposure because treatment with chemicals (e.g., ethanol) that have been shown to block this reaction (Nielsen- Kudsk 1965) result in higher levels of blood mercury and increased renal toxicity (Rumbeiha et al. 1992). Another option would be to reduce the oxidized merc ury ions to the monovalent mercurous form. A treatment of this nature has been suggested for ingested inorganic mercury. Metals and chemicals shown to be antagonistic to th e toxic effects of mercury may offer a possible method of interfering with the mercury's mechanism of acti on. Selenium, as sodium selenite, has been used in counteracting mercury poisoning, although the specifi c mechanism is not understood (Mengel and Karlog 1980; Naganuma and Imura 1981). The efficacy of selen ium administration also appears to be dependent on the form of mercury to which one is exposed. Co-administration of sodium selenite with mercuric chloride resulted in decreased renal toxicity, whereas co -administration with methylmercuric chloride had no effect on renal toxicity (Yasutake et al. 1991b). The nephrotoxic effects of inorganic mercury may beMERCURY 335 2. HEALTH EFFECTS protected against by pretreatment with zinc (Zalups and Cherian 1992). Data in rats suggest that zinc can induce metallothionein in the renal cortex and cause mercury accumulation in the kidneys to shift from the outer medulla to the cortex, where a greater percenta ge is bound to the induced metallothionein. However, despite its potential use for interfering with the mercury- induced renal effects, zinc also prolongs retention in the body. 2.11 ADEQUACY OF THE DATABASE Section 104(i)(5) of CERCLA, as amended, directs the Administrator of ATSDR (in consultation with the Administrator of EPA and agencies and programs of th e Public Health Service) to assess whether adequate information on the health effects of mercury is availa ble. Where adequate information is not available, ATSDR, in conjunction with the National Toxicology Program (NTP), is required to assure the initiation of a program of research designed to determine the health effects (and techniques for developing methods to determine such health effects) of mercury. The following categories of possible data needs have been identified by a joint team of scientists from ATSDR, NTP, and EPA. They are defined as substan ce-specific informational needs that if met would reduce the uncertainties of human health assessment. This definition should not be interpreted to mean that all data needs discussed in this section must be f illed. In the future, the identified data needs will be evaluated and prioritized, and a substance- specific research agenda will be proposed. 2.11.1 Existing Information on Health Effects of Mercury The existing data on health effects of inhalation, oral, and dermal exposure of humans and animals to inorganic and organic mercury are summarized in Figures 2-8 to 2-11. The purpose of these figures is toillustrate the existing information concerning the health effects of inorganic and organic mercury. Each dot in the figures indicates that one or more studies provide information associated with that particulareffect. The dot does not imply anything about the quality of the study or studies. Gaps in this figureshould not be interpreted as \"data needs.\" A data need, as defined in ATSDR's Decision Guide for Identifying Substance-Specific Data Needs Related to Toxicological Profiles (ATSDR 1989), is substance- specific information necessary to conduct comprehens ive public health assessments. Generally, ATSDR defines a data gap more broadly as any substa nce-specific information missing from the scientific literature.MERCURY 340 2. HEALTH EFFECTS Information concerning metallic mercury exists primar ily for the inhalation route of exposure in humans and animals (see Figure 2-8). Human data exist for all categories of effect following inhalation exposure to metallic mercury vapor. The results from inhalati on studies in animals have been reported for all end points except immunological and genotoxic effects, and cancer. With the exception of case studies oncontact dermatitis and neurological effects after acute and occupational dermal exposure to metallic mercury in humans, no studies were located for either the oral or dermal routes of exposure for eitherhumans or animals. Existing information on inorganic mercury salts is shown in Figure 2-9. No studies were found on the health effects from inhaled mercury salts in humans or animals. A number of case histories for acute orchronic oral exposure to mercury salts provide inform ation on systemic and neurological effects and death. Some case histories and occupational studies provide in formation on dermal exposures to mercury salts at acute, intermediate, and chronic exposures leading to death, immunologic, neurologic, and systemic effects. No animal inhalation studies for inorganic mercury salts were identified, and only one acute study provides limited information on death from dermal exposure. A number of animal studies that haveinvestigated the effects from oral exposure to merc ury salts provide good information on systemic effects; limited information on cancer, neurologic, immunologi c, and genotoxic effects; and no information on reproductive or developmental effects. Information on methylmercuric and phenylmercuric me rcury is presented in Figures 2-10 and 2-11. These two forms of organic mercury were chosen to repr esent the group of organic mercurials because they have been detected at Superfund sites, and because methylme rcury is the predominant form of organic mercury in the environment. There is a paucity of information on phenylmercury. Only a few case histories areavailable for effects following inhalation exposure (d eath, acute or chronic systemic effects, and neurologic effects), and the information from these repor ts is very limited. Only one case history for acute systemic effects following dermal exposure to phenylmercury was identified. One chronic oral study inrats and a cancer study in rats and mice provide the onl y animal data for phenylmercury. In contrast, there are a number of human studies on systemic, neurologic, and developmental effects resulting from an oralexposure to methylmercury. No human toxicity da ta were identified for immunologic, reproductive, or genotoxic effect, nor for carcinogenicity. The human data for methylmercury are accompanied by arelatively large number of animal studies representi ng all three exposure durations and providing some, although often limited, information for all health effect s categories. As with phenylmercury, there are only a few case histories for inhalation and dermal expos ures, with limited information on neurologic andMERCURY 341 2. HEALTH EFFECTS systemic effects or death from acute poisonings . The animal data for inhalation exposure to methylmercury is equally scarce and nonexistent for dermal exposures. 2.11.2 Identification of Data Needs Acute-Duration Exposure. The human toxicity information for acute duration exposures to mercury is limited to qualitative data and case histori es following oral, inhalation, and dermal routes of exposure. Several case reports described death due to respiratory impairment from inhaled metallic mercury (Campbell 1948; Kanluen and Gottlieb 1991; Soni et al. 1992; Taueg et al. 1992). Respiratory, cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, hematological, and re nal effects have been observed after acute-duration inhalation exposure to metallic mercury vapors (Bl uhm 1992a, 1992b; Campbell et etal. 1992; Acute exposure to ing ested inorganic mercury salts has also resulted in gastrointestinal and symptoms (Afons o and deAlvarez 1960; Kang-Yum and Oransky 1992). Tremors, irritability, and decreased motor function and reflexes are common neurological symptomsfollowing high-level acute duration exposures to metallic mercury vapors (Adams et al. 1983; Bluhm et al. 1992a; and et al. 1981). Acute to ingested methylmercury has resulted in both neurol ogical and developmental (Al-Mufti et al. 1976; Amin-Zaki et al. 1974; Bakir 1952; Harada Marsh et al. 1980, 1981, 1987; Snyder and Seelinger 1976). Information on short term dermal exposures in humans to inorganic mercury are from case studies, and provide some information on renal,neurological, immunological, and dermatological effects (Bagley et al. 1987; al. Dermal effects from acute duration dermal exposur es to organic mercury compounds have also been reported to a limited extent (Morris 1960). In a hi ghly publicized poisoning, a laboratory researcher was thought to have received a single dermal exposure to the organomercurial, dimethylmercury (estimated at between 0.1 and 0.5 mL at a density of 3 g/mL), that apparently penetrated the researcher's latex safety gloves and resulted in a severe neurotoxicty 5 months later that subsequently ending with death (Blayney et al. 1997; Nierenberg et al. 1998; Toribara et al. 1997). Additional studies on dermal absorption of organic mercury, especially dimethylmercury, are need ed to further evaluate the risk to human health.MERCURY 342 2. HEALTH EFFECTS Acute inhalation exposure to metallic mercury in rats and rabbits have resulted in death, respiratory, gastrointestinal, hepatic, renal, neurological, and/or developmental effects (Ashe et al. 1953; Fredriksson et al. 1992; 1991b). Acute oral expos ures to inorganic mercury have resulted in renal, gastrointestinal, and thyroid effects in rats and/or mice (Dieter et al. 1992; Nielsen et al. 1991; NTP 1993; Sin et al. 1990) and neurological effects in rats (Chang and Hartmann 1972a, 1972b). An acute oral MRL was derived for inorganic mercury based on renal e ffects in rats (NTP 1993). Acute oral exposures to organic mercury have resulted in renal, neurological, developmental, and reproductive effects in rats, mice, guinea pigs, and rabbits (Arito and Takahashi 1991; Bornhausen et Markwort 1990; Yasutake et al. 1991b). Well conducted animal studies on neurological effects from an acute inhalation exposure to metallic mercury or to an acute dermal exposure to organic mercury are needed because of the poten tial for these kinds of exposures to populations near hazardous waste sites. The potential for latent or de layed expression of toxicity after an acute exposure to mercury from all the most likely routes and forms (especially for a dermal exposure to dimethylmercury)needs to be addressed. Intermediate-Duration Exposure. Inhalation data on intermedia te-duration exposure to metallic mercury vapors are limited to case reports of indivi duals exhibiting cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, hematological, renal, dermal, immunological, and neurological effects similar to acute exposures (Anneroth al. 1992; Barber al. 1992; Sexton et al. 1976; Taueg et al. 1992). Workers inhaling diethylmercury vapors developed gastrointestinal and neurological symptoms prior to death (Hill 1943). No inhalation exposure data are available on intermediate- duration exposure to mercuric mercur y. Information on intermediate- duration oral exposure to inorganic mercury is limite d to the observation of neurological symptoms in a boy who ingested Chinese medicine containing merc urous mercury for several months (Kang-Yum and Oransky 1992). Intermediate-duration oral exposur e to organic mercury has resulted in dermal, neurological, and developmental toxicity (Al-Mufti et al. 1976; Amin-Zaki et al. 1974; 1973; Cox et al. 1989; Harada 1978; Marsh et al. 1980, 1981, 1987; Snyder and Seelinger 1976). Intermediate- duration dermal exposure to inorganic mercury has resulted in adverse gastrointestinal, renal, and immunological health effects (Anneroth et al. 1992; Kang-Yum and Oransky 1992). No studies werelocated that examined effects r esulting from intermediate-duration de rmal exposure to organic mercury.MERCURY 343 2. HEALTH EFFECTS Inhalation exposure to metallic mercury vapors for an intermediate duration has resulted in renal and/or neurological effects in rabbits (Ashe et al. 1953) and rats (Fukuda 1971; Kishi et al. 1978). No studies were located regarding effects in animals after in termediate-duration inhala tion exposure to organic mercury. An intermediate inhalation MRL was not derived for metallic mercury because studies were considered inadequate. Following intermediate-dura tion oral exposure to inorganic mercury, adverse cardiovascular, hepatic, and renal hea lth effects have were observed in rats and mice exposed to mercuric chloride (Andres 1984; Carmignani et cal and neurological health effects were also observed (Chang and Hartmann 1972a; Dieter et al. 1983; Hultman and Enestrom 1992). An intermediate oral MRL was derived for inorganic mercury b ased on increased kidney weight in rats (NTP 1993). Intermediate-duration oral exposure to organic me rcury has resulted in adverse cardiovascular, renal, immunological, neurological, and developmental health effects in rats, mice, cats, and monkeys (Berthoud et al. 1976; Burbacher et al. 1988; Chang and al. 1974; Concas al. Evans et Wakita 1987; Yip and Chang 1981). The data were insufficient to derive an intermediate-duration MRL for oral exposure to organic mercury because serious adverse health effects (e.g., neurological degeneration, beha vioral changes) were observed at the lowest doses (Burbacher et al. 1988; Chang et al. 1974; Chang and Hartmann 1972a). No studies were locatedregarding intermediate-duration dermal exposure in animals. Because populations surrounding hazardous waste sites might be exposed to higher-than-normal leve ls of mercury for an intermediate duration, more quantitative information on metallic and organic merc ury toxicity, specifically neurotoxicity, following inhalation and oral exposure in humans and animals is needed. The potential for latent or delayed expression of toxicity after an exposure of in termediate duration needs to be addressed. Chronic-Duration Exposure and Cancer. Occupational exposure to metallic mercury vapors has been reported to result in adverse cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, renal, ocular, immunological, and reproductive health effects (Barregard et al. 1988, Bencko et al. 1990; Bidstrup et al. al. 1977; Tubbs et al. 1982; Vroom and Greer 1972). Substantial evidence indicates that MERCURY 344 2. HEALTH EFFECTS chronic inhalation of metallic mercury vapors results in neurotoxicity (Albers et al. 1988; Bidstrup et al. 1982; Smith et al. 1970; Verberk et al. 1986; Vroom and Greer 1972; Williamson et al.1982). A chronic inhalation MRL was derived for ne urological effects observed in workers chronically exposed to metallic mercury (Fawer et al. 1983). Ve ry limited information is available indicating that chronic-duration inhalation of organic mercury (sometimes unspecified) causes adverse cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, renal, and neurological health e ffects (Brown 1954; Hook et al. 1954; Hunter et al. 1940; Williamson et al. 1982). Chronic-duration ingestion of mercurous chloride resulted in dementia and irritability (Davis et al. 1974). Qualitative and quantitative data on organic mercury exposure are provided by the neurological disorders associated with ingestion of methylmercury-contaminated fish, butthe length of exposure is unknown (K utsuna 1968). Chronic occupati onal exposure to alkyl mercury compounds caused neurological changes in human s (Lundgren and Swensson 1949). The available evidence indicates that the differences in toxicity between inorganic and organic mercury forms are largely the result of the differences in their distri bution in the body. Information concerning methyl- mercury is much more extensive than that for phenylmercury, especially considering the outbreaks of methylmercury poisoning that have occurred in Japan and Iraq. Cardiovascular and renal health effects in rats a nd mice after chronic-duration ingestion of inorganic mercury have been reported (Carmignani et al. 1989; Fitzhugh et al. 1950; NTP 1993). An intermediate oral MRL based on renal effects was derived for inte rmediate oral exposure to inorganic mercury (NTP 1993). Chronic-duration oral exposure to organic merc ury has resulted in adverse gastrointestinal, renal, developmental, neurological, and reproductive hea lth effects in rats, mice, cats, and monkeys (Charbonneau et al. 1976; Fitzhugh et al. 1950; al. 1981, 1992; Rice and Gilbert 1982, 1990, 1992; Solecki et al. 1991). A chronic MRL for oral exposure to organic mercury was derived based on a study of prenatal exposures in a fish-consuming population on the Seychelles Islands (Davidson et al. 1998). Additi onal chronic-duration data on neurological disorders following metallic and organic mercury exposure ar e needed because they are a sensitive end point. Furthermore, there is a potential for chronic e xposure to higher-than-normal levels of mercury in populations living in the vicinity of hazardous waste sites. MERCURY 345 2. HEALTH EFFECTS Additional chronic-duration oral exposure informa tion in animals concerning renal effects following inorganic mercury exposure is needed to evaluate the threshold of this effect in humans following chronic exposure. The data would be usef ul if populations living near hazardous waste sites were to be exposed chronically to inorganic mercury that leach ed into near-by wells or water supplies. Forestomach squamous cell papillomas and thyroid fo llicular cell carcinomas have been observed in rats and renal tubule tumors have been observed in mice following oral exposure to mercuric chloride (NTP 1993). Renal tumors have also been observed in ra ts and mice after oral exposure to organic mercury (Hirano et al. 1986; Mitsumori et al. 1981, 1990; Solecki et al. 1991). These results suggest the potentialcarcinogenicity of mercury to humans. Therefore, additional chronic-duration animal studies on metallic, inorganic, and organic mercury are needed to conf irm the findings of the NTP study. Additional long- term follow-up studies examining carcinogenicity in highly exposed populations (i.e., those involved in mercury mining, or the exposed Iraqi or Japanese popul ations) are needed to evaluate the likelihood of tumors appearing in humans. Genotoxicity. Although there are data from several in vivo studies on rats (oral exposure) and mice (intraperitoneal) indicating that inorganic and or ganic mercury compounds can cause clastogenic effects in mammalian germinal cells, the differences in sp ecies sensitivity, and in some cases strain sensitivity, do not permit the use of these findings for predicting a potential hazard to human genetic material (Suter1975; Zasukhina et al. 1983). Epidemiological studi es of humans occupationally or accidentally exposed to mercurials were inconclusive, but the combined results from these studies did not suggest that metallic mercury and organic mercury are clastogens for hum an somatic cells (Anwar and Gabal et 1979; Verschaeve et al. 1976, 1979; Wulf et al. 1986). There is, however, convincing evidence that inorgani c and organic mercury compounds can interact with and damage DNA in vitro (Williams et al. 1987). The outcome of this damage has not been characterized, but there is some indication that mercury compounds are weak mutagens for cultured mammalian cells. In addition, in vitro results with human cells (Betti et al. 1992) and animal cells (Howard et al. 1991) and in vivo data in mice (Ghosh et al. 1991) suggest that mercury compounds can cause clastogenic effects in somatic cells. Considering the problems stated above in using the wholeanimal data, and the apparent species- and strain-s pecific responses noted in the DNA damage tests with cultured mammalian cells, the in vitro data, while of interest, are probably not reliable indicators of potential adverse effects in humans exposed to merc ury. Well controlled human epidemiological studies are needed to determine the genetic hazard of mercury compounds to humans.MERCURY 346 2. HEALTH EFFECTS Reproductive Toxicity. Occupational exposure to metallic merc ury has not been shown to result in statistically significant effects on male fertility (Al cser et al. 1989; Lauwerys et al. 1985). However, an increase in the rate of spontaneous abortions may o ccur (Cordier et al. 1991). A spontaneous abortion occurred in a female after ingesting an acute dose of mercuric chloride (A fonso and deAlvarez 1960). There were no studies available on dermal exposure to metallic, inorganic, or organic mercury. Additional epidemiological studies on inhalation and de rmal exposure to mercury are needed to evaluate the threshold of reproductive effects in worker s (including dentists and dental assistants). Inorganic mercury exposure caused a significant incr ease in the incidence of resorptions in hamsters (Gale 1974). Abortions and decreased mean litter size ha ve been observed in rats, mice, guinea pigs, and monkeys following oral exposure to organic merc ury (Burbacher et al. 1988; Hughes and Annau 1976; Inouye and Kajiwara 1988; Khera 1973). There was a decrease in conceptions and an increase in early abortions and stillbirths in female monkeys exposed orally to methylmercury for 4 months, but the menstrual cycle length was not affected (Burbacher et al. 1988). However, prolonged estrous cycles were found in rats inhaling metallic mercury (Bar anski and Szymczyk 1973). Adverse effects on spermatogenesis and on histopathology of the testes have been reported in several studies in animalsexposed to methylmercury (Hirano et al. 1986; Mits umori et al. 1990; Mohamed et al. 1987). There was no information on reproductive effects following dermal exposure to mercury in animals. A 90-day study is needed to provide reproductive organ pathology da ta on male and female animals. Multigenerational studies for inorganic and organic mercury are also needed. Additional reproductive studies are needed because reproductive-aged populations near hazardous waste sites might be exposed to mercury. Developmental Toxicity. Occupational exposure to metallic mercury in males did not result in statistically significant effects on malformations or the number of children born (Alcser et al. 1989; Lauwerys et al. 1985). The results from an inhala tion developmental rat study (Baranski and Szymczyk 1973) suggest that metallic mercury vapors may cau se a higher incidence of fetal malformations, resorptions, and deaths. Dermal studies on metallic me rcury in humans and animals were not available. Additional well-conducted inhalation and dermal studies on metallic mercury in animals are needed to evaluate the potential for adverse developmental effects to humans from mercury. Inorganic mercury exposure caused a significant incr ease in the incidence of resorptions in hamsters (Gale 1974). No other human or animal studies we re available on developmental effects following inorganic mercury exposure. Therefore, additional studies for inhalation, oral, and dermal exposures areMERCURY 347 2. HEALTH EFFECTS needed to evaluate the potential developmental toxi city of inorganic mercury to populations, specifically young children, living near hazardous waste sites. Longitudinal studies for higher dose level acute and intermediate exposures are needed to determin e the potential delayed expression of toxicity. Prenatal exposure to methylmercury from contaminated food during the early stages of pregnancy hascaused neurological damage in humans (Amin-Zaki et al. 1974; Bakir et al. 1973; Choi et 1989; Engleson and Herner 1952; Ma Matsumoto et al. 1965; McKeown-Eyssen et al. 1983; Snyder and Seelinger 1976) . Severe neurological impairment developed in a child exposed in utero to methylmercury, and effects were still present at 6 years of age (Snyder and Seelinger 1976). In animals, numerous oral exposur e studies on the developmental effects of organic mercury have been conducted. Disruptions in the development of the nervous system in rats, mice, hamsters, and guinea pigs (Chang et al. 1977; Inouye and al. and in the immune system in rats (Ilback et al. 1991) have been reported. Behavioral changes were also observed in rats and mice (Bornhausen et al. 1980; Hughes and Annau 1976; Olson 1975). long-term inhalation, oral, and dermal studies for inorganic and organic mercury are needed to evaluate the thr eshold of developmental effects in workers chronically exposed to mercury or in populations living near hazardous waste sites. Immunotoxicity. The results from two occupational studies indicate a decreased serum IgG levels in workers to inhaled metallic mercury vapors (Bencko et al. 1990; Moszczynski et al. 1990b), but these studies are limited and did not evaluate potential confounders (smoking and alcohol). Other studies in similarly exposed populations did not observe an increases in serum immunoglobulins (IgA, IgG, IgE, or IgM) and autoantibody titres (antilaminin or antiglomerular b asement membrane antibodies) (Bernard et al. 1987; Cardenas et al. 1993; Langworth et al. 1992b). There is limited information in humans that suggests thatcertain individuals may develop an autoimmune r esponse (Tubbs et al. 1982; Moszczynski et al. 1995). Data on immunological effects following oral exposur e to organic mercury compounds in humans are not available. Oral exposures to inorganic and organic mercury in animals indicate that the immune system maybe a target organ for mercury. Immune deposits were observed in the intestines and kidneys of rats exposed to mercuric chloride for 2 months, but no functi onal changes were evident in these tissues (Andres 1984). Suppression of the lymphoproliferative response occurred at a higher dose of mercury in mice exposed tomercuric chloride for 7 weeks (Dieter et al. 1983). Reduced natural killer cell activity in spleen and blood was exhibited in mice administered a diet containing methylmercury for 12 weeks (Ilback 1991). It isunknown how an adverse effect on the immune sy stem from exposure to one form of mercury MERCURY 348 2. HEALTH EFFECTS might affect the response to other forms or other r outes of exposure (e.g., how an adverse immune effect induced by inhalation of mercury vapor from dent al amalgam might effect the dose-response from exposure to ingested methylmercury). Therefore, the potential for immunotoxic effects from exposure tomercury vapor, mercury salts, or methylmercury sep arately or in combination is of considerable importance and warrants further research, especially from low level chronic exposures. Neurotoxicity. The nervous system is the major targ et organ for metallic and organic mercury through inhalation and oral routes, respectively. In humans, the neurological effects of metallic mercury have been observed primarily after acute high-concen tration exposures (accidental) to intermediate and chronic low-concentration exposures (occupational). Tremors and irritability are the most prominent symptoms of inhaled metallic mercury in humans (Alb ers et al. 1988; Bidstrup et al. 1951; Fawer et al. 1983; Piikivi et al. 1984). Information on effects in humans from oral exposure includes case histories, forexample, a chronic oral exposure to a laxative contai ning mercurous chloride (Davis et al. 1974), acute to intermediate duration ingestion of high levels of methylmercury-contaminated food (Bakir et al. 1973; Kutsuna 1968), or to chronic low-level exposures from fish or marine mammals containing methylmercury (Davidson et al. 1995aa, 1995b; Grandjean et al. 1997b, 1998). Case histories of dermal exposure toinorganic mercury cite similar neurological effects from acute (Bourgeois et al. 1986; DeBont et al. 1986) or chronic exposures (Dyall-Smith and Scurry 1990). The neurotoxicity of inhaled metallic mercury has b een studied in animals for acute and intermediate exposures (Ashe et al. 1953; Ganser and Kirschner 1985; Kishi et al. 1978). Behavioral, motor, and cognitive effects, as well as histopathological changes in the brain, were reported in rats, rabbits, and mice. Neurological disturbances in rats and mice resulted fro m acute, intermediate, and chronic oral exposures to mercuric mercury (Chang and Hartmann 1972b; Ganser and Kirschner 1985). Oral exposure to organic mercury in animals produced a range of neurological changes (Charbonneau et al. 1976; Evans et al. 1977;Magos and Butler 1972; Rice and Gilbert 1982; Sharma et al. 1982; Tsuzuki 1981). A chronic inhalation MRL was derived for metallic mercury. Additional an imal studies are needed, however, to evaluate the neurotoxicity of inorganic mercuric salts to resolv e some of the conflicting findings from pervious work (Chang and Hartmann 1972b; NTP 1993). In vivo studies are needed to evaluate the m echanisms of neurotoxic effects seen in in vitro studies, i.e., the lipoperoxidation and cell injury in methylmercury-e xposed cerebellar granule cells (Sarafian and Verity 1991). Further evaluation is needed in humans and anim al models of the potential for neurological effects and delayed neurotoxicity from chr onic low level exposures to organic and inorganic mercury, especially MERCURY 349 2. HEALTH EFFECTS from multiple sources (i.e., organic mercury from fish consumption in conjuncti on with metallic mercury released from dental amalgam). Epidemiological and Human Dosimetry Studies. There have been a number of occupational studies on workers chronically exposed to metallic mercury vapors. Mercury exposure (as measured by urine or blood mercury levels) and neurological effect s have been evaluated (Adams et al. 1983; Miller et al. 1975; Roels et al. 1982; Smith et al. 1970). The most obvious deficiency in these epidemiologicalstudies is the absence of good measures of exposure. Additional data are needed on the potential health effects for populations near hazardous waste sites based upon specific identification of the form of mercury and the pathways of exposure (i.e., the levels of exposure that populations near waste sites may actually experience from inorganic mercury in the air, water, and soil, or methylmercury in contaminated food). An area of considerable controversy, which is in need of good epidemiological data, is the potential for adverse effects from the mercury released from dental amalgam. Although this is not an exposure pathway associated with hazardous waste sites, mercury from am algam represents a major contributor to the total body burden for a large percentage of the population, a nd thus must be factored into an assessment of the toxicokinetic behavior and toxic effects of mercury originating from a waste site. Long term longitudinal studies are needed for all dose durations and forms to evaluate delayed or persis tent expression of mercury toxicity. Biomarkers of Exposure and Effect Exposure . Blood and urine mercury levels have been u sed as biomarkers of high level exposure in acute and chronic studies for both inorganic and organic mercury (Akesson et al. 1991; Naleway et al. 1991; Verschoor et al. 1988). Hair has been used as a biom arker for chronic low level organic mercury exposure (Nielsen and Andersen 1991a, 1991b; Oskarsson et al. 1990), with an awareness of the potential for external contamination (Clarkson et al. 1983). Furt her development of more sensitive tests to measure mercury in expired air and retention in hair are needed for monitoring short- and long-term exposures, respectively, for populations at risk. As seen in other studies comparing European to Japan ese hair mercury levels, th e hair levels reported by Nakagawa (1995) of 2-4 ppm for a Japanese population are 10-20 times higher than levels observed in the Drasch et al. (1997) study (median, 0.247 \u00b5g/g in hair; range, 0.43-2.5 \u00b5g/g). These differences in the mercury exposure may affect not only the mercury ha ir levels but also the mercury hair-to-tissueMERCURY 350 2. HEALTH EFFECTS correlations. Further study is needed on the effects that the exposure level of methylmercury (as well as other forms of mercury) has on tissue distributions and the correlation to biomarkers of exposure. There are potential confounding factors and other f actors to consider when assessing mercury exposure based upon mercury hair levels. Mercury may be de posited to hair from the air when significant sources of mercury are present in the air or when certain hair treatments are used (Hac and Krechniak 1993; WHO 1991). Potential sources of external mercury exposur e should, therefore, be evaluated as part of an exposure assessment. Some studies also report a sex rela ted difference in mercury tissue levels. Nielson et al. (1994) observed a significant sex-related differences in the toxicokinetics of methylmercury in micefollowing administration of a single radiolabeled dose. Drasch et al. (1997) reported that mercury levels in all tissues assayed in their human cadaver study had higher levels compared to male tissues. The difference was significant for the kidney (med ian female kidney me rcury level=92.0 ng/g, males=40.8 ng/g; p=0.002). In blood and urine there was a similar trend. In contrast, the authors report that mercury hair levels in females were signifi cantly lower than in males (median females=205 ng/g, males 285 ng/g; p=0.02). Nakagawa (1995) also re port higher mean mercury hair levels in males (2.98 \u00b5g/g) compared with females (2.02 \u00b5g/g) in a Japanese population. Further research is, therefore, needed to characterize potential sex related differe nce in the toxicokinetics of mercury under different exposure scenarios. Further research on other biomarkers of mercury does not warrant a high priority.Of particular importance is the collection of pharm acokinetic data showing th e relationship between low- level exposure (acute, intermediate, and chroni c) and blood and urine levels throughout the study .duration. Also tissue levels at necropsy should be taken immediately after cessation of dosing. In animal studies, a similar group of animals should be followe d for urine (and blood, but not as important here) mercury levels for periods of 30, 60, 90, and 120 days postdosing to examine whole-body excretion, and necropsy tissue samples should also be taken from sever al animals at 30, 60, 90, and 120 days postdosing. Primates would be the best animal model, but rodent models could suffice. A needed study is a longitudinal epidemiology study that tracked daily individual exposure levels in chloralkali industry workers, fluorescent lightbulb manufact urers, or other mercury utilizing industries, and associated these exposure levels with weekly urine and blood samples for a period of 1-2 years. Neurobehavioral testing (using tests from ATSDR's r ecommended test battery for adults) should be used MERCURY 351 2. HEALTH EFFECTS conducted at 6-month intervals. Workers new to these industries would be the best subjects, since their pre-exposure blood and urine levels could be used as reference values. A biomarker/exposure could also be conducted in persons with dental amalgam fillings. Urine levels should be tracked in those with fillings and in those with removed or replaced amalgam fillings. There are a number of confounding factors and logistical di fficulties in conducting such studies, and new study protocols should be developed to address the problems encountered in previous studies. Effect . Potential biomarkers of effect for mercury- induced renal toxicity have been well described (Cardenas et al. 1993; Lauwerys et al. 1983; Rosenman et al. al. 1988). Biomarkers forneurological changes (e.g., paresthesia, decreased mo tor function, and impair ed nerve conduction) have also been described (Clarkson et al. 1976; Shapiro et al. 1982). There is long history of evaluation of theneurophysiological and neuropsychological effects associat ed with mercury levels in blood, urine, and (Levine et al. 1982; Vroom and Greer 1972; Williamson et al. 1982). More recently, studies are evaluatingcognitive and neurobehavioral effects with increasing sophistication in the assays and analyses that are used (Davidson et al. 1998; Grandjean et al. 1997b, 1998). Additional biomarkers are needed in this continuing effort to resolve subtle cognitive or neur obehavioral effects, and immune system effects from chronic low level exposures to methylmercury in f ood or metallic mercury released from dental amalgam, especially in sensitive populations. Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, and Excretion. Limited data are available to assess the relative rate and extent of absorption in human s following inhalation exposure to metallic mercury (Barregard et al. 1992; Berlin et al. 1969; et al. 1976; Teisinger and Fiserova-Bergerova 1965) and in humans and animals fo llowing oral exposure to both inorganic salts and organic et al. et al. 1990; Weiss et al. 1973; Yeoh et al. 1989). Indirect evidence of absorption following inhalati on exposure in humans and animals is reported for inorganic and organic mercury (Clarkson 1989; Ostl und 1969; Warfvinge et al. 1992; Yoshida et al. 1990, 1992). Only limited quantitative data were located rega rding dermal uptake of metallic mercury in humans (Hursh et al. 1989). Information is needed regarding th e rate and extent of dermal absorption of inorganic and organic mercury in humans and animals. Quan titative information concerning the inhalation and oral absorption of mercury (all forms)are needed.MERCURY 352 2. HEALTH EFFECTS In general, quantitative data are ava ilable to evaluate the rate and extent of distribution, metabolism, and elimination of mercury in humans and animals fo llowing inhalation and oral exposure. Data on distribution, metabolism, and excretion following derm al exposure are lacking for all forms of mercury. The distribution data for metallic, inorganic and or ganic mercury are similar in humans and animals (Aschner 1991b; 1976; Schionning et al. et al. 1992; Warfvinge et al. 1992; Yeoh et al. 1989; Yoshida et al. 1990, 1992). No quantitative distribution data were located fororganic mercury compounds following inhalation expos ure. The oxidation and reduction reactions that control the disposition of elemental mercury were identified in both animals and humans (Clarkson 1989; Halbach and biotransformation of organic mercury are limited (Norseth and Clarkson 1970). Re liable quantitative evidence on excretion of metallic and inorganic mercury in humans and animals following inhalation exposure is available (Cherian et al. 1978; Hursh et al. 1976; Joselow et al. 1968b; Lovejoy et al. 1974). As discussed in the section on data needs for biomarkers , further study is needed on the effects that the exposure level of methylmercury (as well as other form s of mercury) has on tissue distributions and the correlation to biomarkers of exposure. Age appears to be a factor in the elimination of mercury in rats following inorganic and organic mercury exposures (D aston et al. 1986; Thomas et al. 1982). Elimination of methylmercury in rats may also be sex-related (Ballatori and Clarkson 1982). Nielson et al. (1994) observed a significant sex-related differences in the toxicokinetics of methylmercury in mice following administration of a single radiolabeled dose. Drasch et al. (1997) reported that mercury levels in all tissuesassayed in their human cadaver study had higher levels compared to male tissues. Nakagawa (1995) also report higher mean mercury hair levels in males (2 .98 \u00b5g/g) compared with females (2.02 \u00b5g/g) in a Japanese population. Further research is, therefore, n eeded to characterize potential sex related difference in the toxicokinetics of mercury under different exposure scenarios. Insufficient data are available to assess whether or not there are any differences in absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion of mercury with respect to time or dose (i.e., if saturation phenomena occur). The majority of the available toxicokinetic data i nvolve acute exposures to single doses. For all three routes, studies are needed that compare various dose leve ls and durations in order to determine if there are any differences in the toxicokinetics of mercury. Little is known about how mercurials are eliminated from specific organs. In particular, the mechanism by which mercury is eliminated from the brain isMERCURY 353 2. HEALTH EFFECTS unknown. This information is needed to design better treatment drugs and protocols. Mechanistic studies are needed on how mercury (in its various forms) is excreted and how such activities can be enhanced. An important priority research and data need is a st udy of the effects of dietary selenium on the absorption and toxicity of methylmercury. Primates would be the most appropriate species for such a study. Oraldosage levels (in food) should cover an sufficient do se range to provide useful information for high fish consuming populations. Mercury excr etion should also be measured and compared with controls at least weekly, with the entire study length being not less th an 6 months, and preferably one to two years in duration. Concurrent neurobehavior al testing should be included, if possible, and be conducted at fixed intervals depending upon the duration of the study. Comparative Toxicokinetics. There is only limited data available on species differences in absorption rates following oral exposures to all forms of mercury, and the results are negative (i.e., no differences) (Clarkson 1971, 1972a; Friberg and No rdberg 1973; Nielsen and Andersen 1990; Rice 1989b). There are data concerning inhalation absorption of metallic and inorganic mercury (Berlin et al. 1969; Cherian et al. 1978; Clarkson 1989; Hursh et the data are insufficient to allowfor interspecies comparisons (Ostlund 1969). Studies co mparing the inhalation absorption of all forms of mercury in humans and animals are needed to improve the utility of animal data in assessing human risk. The limited information available on dermal exposure suggests that dermal absorption of both inorganic and organic mercury compounds occurs in humans a nd animals, although no comparison of the rate or extent of absorption can be made between species (G otelli et al. 1985; Hursh et 1918). As with inhalation exposure, studies comparing the dermal absorption of all forms of mercury in humans and animals are needed to improve the utility of animal data for assessing human risk. The distribution of mercury in humans and animals app ears to be similar. The lipophilic nature of metallic mercury results in its distribution throughout the body in humans (Takahata et al. 1970) and in animals(Berlin and Johansson 1964; Berlin et al. 1966). Di stribution of inorganic mercury compounds resembles that of metallic mercury; however, human distribution is preferentially to the kidneys, liver, and intestines. Also, levels in the brain are substantially lower, as these compounds have a lower lipophilicity. Distribution of organic mercury compounds is also similar to that of metallic mercury. The ability ofmethylmercuric compounds to cross the blood-brain and placental barriers enables ready distribution to alltissues, although, again, the highest levels are f ound in the kidneys. Phenylmercuric compounds areMERCURY 354 2. HEALTH EFFECTS initially distributed in a similar manner to methylme rcury; however, the distribution eventually resembles that of inorganic mercury. The available evidence suggests that feces and urine constitute the main excretory pathways of metallic mercury and inorganic mercury compounds in both hum ans and animals. Additional excretory routes following metallic and inorganic mercury exposure incl ude exhalation and secretion in saliva, sweat, bile, and breast milk (Joselow et al. 1968b; Lovejoy 1992). Excretion follo wing exposure to organic mercury is considered to be predominantly through the fecal route in humans. Evidence from studies in humans and animals (mice, rats) suggests that exposure to methylmercury leads primarily to biliary secretion, while excretion is initially through the bile; it then shifts to the urin e following phenylmercury exposure (Berlin and Ullberg 1963; Berlin al. 1975; Gotelli et al. and Clarkson 1971). No further comparative studieson excretion are warranted because there is no apparent difference in the excretion of mercury in any form in humans and animals. Two PBPK models have recently been published on the pharmacokinetics of methylmercury in rats (Farris et al. 1993; Gray 1995). Additional PBPK studies are needed to support species and dose extrapolations,and a better understanding of the underl ying toxic and kinetic mechanisms is needed in support of human risk assessments. Validation of in vitro data is a major need. Much of the data from in vitro experimentation is based on unrealistic concentrations of the toxicant or is derived from studies using non-physiological designs. In particular, more validation is needed for immunotoxicity studies and biochemical studies. Methods for Reducing Toxic Effects. Nonspecific methods or treatments for reducing absorption following mercury exposure include the administration of chelators or protein solutions to neutralize and bind to inorganic mercury compounds (Bronstein 1984). The use of a particular chelator is dependent upon the type of mercury exposure (Gossel and Bricker 1984). Chelation therap y is the treatment of choice for reducing the body burden of mercury (Florentine and Sanfilippo 1991; Gossel and Bricker 1984; Haddad and Winchester 1990). However, chelation releases mercury from soft tissu es that can then be redistributed to the brain. Additional research is needed to el ucidate the mechanisms of absorption and distribution of inorganic and organic mercury. Animal studies suggest that antioxidants may be useful for decreasing the toxicity ofMERCURY 355 2. HEALTH EFFECTS mercury. Additional work studying the effectiveness of prophylactic administration of vitamin E (or other antioxidants) and of proper diet are needed. Improve d chelation and drug therapies for treating acute and chronic mercury poisonings are greatly needed. Children's Susceptibility. The systemic health effects from different forms of mercury and exposure routes have been fairly well characterized (EPA 1997; Sue 1994; WHO 1990). There is generally sufficient information on the symptoms to resolve the form and route of exposure when children are exposed to high levels of mercury. There is less inform ation to assist the physician or public health official in recognizing the symptoms that might arise from lowe r level exposure to multiple forms of mercury (e.g., dental amalgam and fish) and multiple pathways (inha lation and ingestion). Wh ether concurrent exposures would result in a different presentation of symptoms would be important information in determining the best therapeutic treatment. Some health effects cat egories are not well defined (e.g., immune responses). Earlier identification of immunotoxicity is of con cern for children because of the progressive nature of hypersensitization to environmental pollutants, a nd the burden that a compromised immune system can place on a person's long-term health. There are not presently adequate measures for neurol ogic development. Delayed developmental effects are of grave concern for children exposed to mercur y; methods for early determination and detection of progressively worsening changes in a child's behavi oral or cognitive function are needed. For the measures to be truly useful they should in some way be integrated into a more directed exposure assessment and body burden analysis and to resolve the contribution from other influences on cognitive abilities and behaviors. Other data needs relate d to developmental effects are discusses above under Developmental Toxicity. Pharmacokinetics are different for children, and more data are needed to improve chelation therapies for both acute high-level poisoning and for chronic low-level exposures. This is perhaps the area that deserves the most attention because accidental poisonings conti nue to occur and there are virtually no therapies to ameliorate the inevitable progression of mercury intoxica tion. Since environmental levels of mercury are also continuing to rise, and levels in food will conc urrently rise, strategies to boost the body's ability to eliminate absorbed mercury are going to become incr easingly important (i.e., the alternative is to change dietary patterns, i.e., eat less fish, and the risk/ben efits of doing that are already being hotly debated). There appears to be adequate information on th e metabolism of mercury, and there are no special metabolites or metabolic pathways that are uni que to children and require further evaluation.MERCURY 356 2. HEALTH EFFECTS The mechanism of mercury toxicity is still largel y unknown. It is not known whether there are unique mechanisms of action for the toxic effects in child ren that would require special consideration for treatment modalities, but at present it appears that targ et site is determined more by the pharmacokinetics (i.e., which tissues end up with the highest levels) than by a specific mechanism of action (e.g., a receptor binding-process initiating type of mechanism). The results of a number of accidental food poisonings indicate that children are more vulnerable, and this vulnerability may be a function of easier access of mercury to the systemic circulation and brain, or it maybe because disruption of cell growth and organization is more critical for children in developmental stages of growth. More data are needed to determine if the vulnerability of children is due to less plasticity to insult of analogous target tissue in adults, or becau se target tissues actually receive more toxic agent. There are not adequate biomarkers of exposure nor adequate access to biomarkers of exposure. Hair, urine, and blood levels are gross measures of body burden and do not provide the essential information about levels of mercury at target tissues. Resear ch is needed into better (preferably noninvasive) monitoring tools. Research is also needed on how to make monitoring tests readily and inexpensively available to the general public. Merc ury is one of the top ten most hazar dous substances, and its levels are increasing in the environment. There is consider able anxiety present in the general population about potential mercury toxicity from dental amalgam, but this occurs in the absence of good information onactual body burdens. The general public and health officials would benefit from readily available ways for individuals to measure personal and family member mercury body burdens. The interactions of immediate interest are those that either affect absorption fro m the gastrointestinal tract or that prevent or reduce mercury toxicity. No information was identified to indicate that mercuryinteracts differently with iron or zinc, for example, in a child's body then it would in an adult, although the difference in children's physiology and morphology may r esult in a different response to that interaction. Except for the latter, which is again a toxicokinetic qu estion, chemical interactions do not appear to be a data need. There is a data need to develop better chelation ther apies, better ways to prevent absorption of mercury into the body of children, and better ways to interfere with the mechanism of action, especially for damage to the nervous system. The current literature conti nues to grow with case histories of poisonings whereMERCURY 357 2. HEALTH EFFECTS supportive therapy and passive observation of a progressive ly deteriorating health status are the best that can be done. No information was found that parental exposure to merc ury results in heritable defects or deficits in germ cell function that would be translated to the offspring. There is considerable information on the transfer of mercury from the mother to the developing child, bot h during the prenatal period via the placenta and during postnatal nursing; both inorganic mercury and or ganic mercury pass from mother to child. This is an area of active research primarily to characterize th e dose, duration, and form of mercury to which the child is being exposed. Further work in this area is needed. Child health data needs related to exposure are di scussed in Section 5.8.1, Data Needs: Exposure of Children. 2.11.3 Ongoing Studies Ongoing studies regarding mercury's health effects and mechanisms of action were reported in the Federal Research In Progress (FEDRIP 1998) database. Table 2-14 lists these studies. MERCURY 363 3. CHEMICAL AND PHYSICAL INFORMATION 3.1 CHEMICAL IDENTITY Information regarding the chemical identity of mercury compounds is located in Table 3-1. 3.2 PHYSICAL AND CHEMICAL PROPERTIES Information regarding the physical and chemical proper ties of mercury compounds is located in Table 3-2. Mercuric acetate has been included as an organic form of mercury. However, the bonds of the salt are not covalent and, in aqueous solution, the mercury behaves like an inorganic form.MERCURY 371 4. PRODUCTION, IMPORT/EXPORT, USE, AND DISPOSAL 4.1 PRODUCTION Mercury is a naturally occurring element that is usua lly found as mercuric sulfide (cinnabar), an insoluble, stable compound. It occurs in the earth's crust at levels averaging 0.5 ppm, but the actual concentration varies considerably depending on location (Merck 1989; Sidle 1993). Mercury is mined using both open pit (10% of production) and underground mining techniques (90%) (Drake 1981). Mercury ores are processed inexpensively to produce me tallic mercury. Due to the low boiling point of elemental mercury, mercury can be refined by hea ting the ore and condensing the vapor to form metallic mercury. This method is 95% efficient and yields merc ury that is 99.9% pure. The methods used to refine mercury ores are uncomplicated. Smaller refineries use simple firing and condensing equipment, while larger operations use continuous rotary kilns or mechanically feeding and discharging multiple-hearth furnaces (Carrico 1985). Table 4-1 lists the facilities in each state that manuf acture or process mercury, the intended use, and the range of maximum amounts of mercury that are stored on site. There are currently 34 facilities thatproduce or process mercury in the United States. The data listed in Table 4-1 are derived from the Toxics Release Inventory (TRI96 1998). Since only certain ty pes of facilities are required to report (EPA 1996d), this is not an exhaustive list. With the closure of the McDermitt Mine in Nevada in 1990, mercury ceased to be a principal product of U.S. industry (USGS 1997). The figures for the total out put of this mine have been withheld by the Bureau of Mines to avoid disclosure of company proprie tary data (see Table 4-2). As of 1995, eight mines in California, Nevada, and Utah produced mercur y as a by-product from gold mining operations. Metals in the gold ores are extracted with an aqueous cy anide solution, with typical mercury recoveries of between 10 and 20% (Jasinski 1993; USGS 1997). A pproximately 58 metric tons of mercury were produced as a by-product from 8 mines in 1991 and 64 metric tons were produced as a by-product from 9 mines in 1992. Since then, production volumes have been withheld to avoid disclosing companyproprietary data. Although most of the world production of mercury is ge nerated by mercury mines, most of the mercury produced in the United States comes from secondary production sources (recycling) (EPA 1997). MERCURY 374 4. PRODUCTION, IMPORT /EXPORT, USE, AND DISPOSAL Secondary production of mercury includes the pro cessing of scrapped mercury-containing products, and industrial waste and scrap (EPA 1997). As a result of the increasingly stricter regulations that have been placed on the disposal of mercury-containing produc ts, secondary production using recycled mercury has increased from 165 metric tons in 1991 to 176 metric tons in 1992, 350 metric tons in 1993, 466 metric tons in 1994, and 534 metric tons in 1995. Mercury was recovered from various waste materials, including mercury batteries, dental amalgams, switches (includi ng thermostats), manometers, chloralkali wastewater sludges, chemical solutions, and fluorescent light tubes. Refining of the recycled mercury was dominatedby three companies: Bethlehem Apparatus Co., Helle rtown, Pennsylvania; D.F. Goldsmith Co., Evanston, Illinois; and Mercury Refining Co., Albany, New York (USGS 1997). 4.2 IMPORT/EXPORT Until 1989, the United States was a net importer of mercury. After that, market values of mercury fluctuated and consumption diminished, leading to a decreased need for imported mercury (Carrico 1985; Drake 1981). U.S. imports of mercury fell sh arply between 1987 and 1990 (Jasinski 1993; Reese 1990). The import volumes decreased drastically during the period from 1987 to 1990: 636 metric tons in 1987,329 metric tons in 1988, 131 metric tons in 1989, a nd 15 metric tons in 1990 (see Table 4-2). However, import figures generally have increased substantially si nce 1990: 56 metric tons in 1991, 92 metric tons in 1992, 40 metric tons in 1993, 129 metric tons in 1994, and 277 metric tons in 1995 (USGS 1997). The major reason for the recent escalation in mercury im ports is the suspension of mercury sales from the National Defense Stockpile (NDS) in 1994, which had been the major supplier of mercury to the domestic market in recent years. The suspension was impo sed by Congress after the EPA raised questions about potential problems associated with the release of merc ury. Also, there was concern about the export of NDS mercury for uses banned in the United States (USGS 1997). From 1978 to 1988, figures were unavailable for the am ount of mercury exported by the United States. The U.S. export figures for mercury from 1989 to 1992 ar e: 221 metric tons in 1989, 311 metric tons in 1990, 786 metric tons in 1991 (Jasinski 1993; Reese 1990) , 977 metric tons in 1992, 389 metric tons in 1993, 316 metric tons in 1994, and 179 metric tons in 1995 (USGS 1997) (see Table 4-2). General trends in exportation of mercury are difficult to character ize because the data are unavailable for the 11 years prior to 1989. However, the decline of exports in 1995 is largely due to the suspension of sales from the NDS (USGS 1997). Major mercury producing countries (primary producti on from mining operations) in the world currently include Algeria, China, Czechoslovakia, Finla nd, Kyrgyzstan, Mexico, Morocco, Russia, Slovakia,MERCURY 375 4. PRODUCTION, IMPORT /EXPORT, USE, AND DISPOSAL Slovenia, Spain, Turkey, and the Ukraine (USGS 1997) . The world reserves of mercury are estimated to be sufficient to supply enough product for 100 years, given current production and consumption estimates (Jasinski 1993). 4.3 USE Mercury has many applications in industry due to its unique properties, such as its fluidity, its uniform volume expansion over the entire liquid temperature range , its high surface tension, and its ability to alloy with other metals. However, dom estic consumption of mercury has shown a downward trend since the early 1970s. In 1995, consumption was 463 metric tons, down 10% from 1994. The largest commercial use of mercury in the United States was for electrolytic production of chlorine and caustic soda in mercury cells, accounting for 35% of domestic consumpti on. Manufacture of wiring devices and switches accounted for 19%, measuring and control instruments for 9%, dental equipment and supplies used 7%, electric lighting used 7%, and other uses used 21% (EPA 1997; USGS 1997). Due to the high toxicity of mercury in most of its forms, many applications ha ve been canceled as a result of attempts to limit the amount of exposure to mercury waste. Electrical applications . Mercury is a critical element in alka line batteries. In the past, excess amounts of mercury were used in batteries; however, alkaline ba ttery manufacturers in Europe, Japan, and the United States are now reducing the mercury load from 0.1% to 0.025% of battery content. This reduction will ultimately limit the amount of mercury needed in the battery industry to below 4 metric tons per year (Cole et al. 1992; Reese 1990). Mercuric oxide has become increasingly important commercially in theproduction of galvanic cells with me rcuric oxide anodes in combination with zinc or cadmium cathodes. The voltage for these small, button-shaped batteries re mains constant during discharge. The batteries are used in hearing devices, digital watches, exposure meters, pocket calculators, and security installations (IARC 1993), but their use has been declining as non-mercury replacement battery production hasincreased. Some electrical lamps use mercury vapors in discharge tubes. These lamps are efficient, long- lasting, and produce more lumens per watt than mo st other industrial lamps (Drake 1981). Wiring and switching devices, such as thermostats and cathode tub es, use mercury because of its predictable contact resistance, thermal conductivity, and quiet operation (Carrico 1985; Drake 1981). In 1985, 64% of the mercury used in the United States was for electrical applications. This use declined to 29% in 1992 (IARC 1993). MERCURY 376 4. PRODUCTION, IMPORT /EXPORT, USE, AND DISPOSAL Medical applications . Metallic mercury is used in dental rest orations because of its ability to alloy with other metals. The World Health Organization (WHO 1991) estimated that, in industrialized countries, about 3% of the total mercury consumption is fo r dental amalgams. Based on 1992 dental manufacturer specifications, amalgam (at mixing) contains approxima tely 50% metallic mercury, 35% silver, 9% tin, 6% copper, and trace amounts of zinc. Estimates of a nnual mercury usage by United States dentists range from approximately 100,000 kg in the 1970s to 70,000 kg in 1995. More than 100 million fillings are replaced each year in the United States (Lorscheider et al. 1995). Until 30 years ago, mercury compoundswere used extensively in pharmaceuticals. Merc ury salts were components of antiseptics (e.g., merthiolate, mercurochrome), diuretics, skin lightening creams, and laxatives (calomel). Organic mercurycompounds were employed in antisyphilitic drugs and some laxatives. Phenylmercury acetate was used in contraceptive gels and foams and as a disinfectant (IA RC 1993). Since then, more effective and less toxic alternatives have replaced most pharmaceutical u ses of mercury. Medical equipment, such as thermometers and manometers, use metallic mercury to measure temperature and pressure (Carrico 1985). Chemical/mining applications . Mercury is a catalyst in reactions to form polymers, such as vinyl chloride and urethane foams. The preparation of chlorine and caustic soda (NaOH) from brines also uses mercury as a catalyst. In this process, mercury is used as a moving cathode to separate sodium and chlorine (Rieber and Harris 1994). This mercury can be recycled with 95% efficiency (Drake 1981). Consumption occurs as mercury is lost in wastewater treatment, is r ecaptured, reprocessed, and sent to landfills (Rieber and Harris 1994). Mercuric oxide and mercuric sulfide ar e used as pigments in paints (Winship 1985). Gold mining operations use mercury to extract gol d from ores through amalgamation (Carrico 1985). Other applications. Phenylmercuric acetate has been used in aqueous preparations such as inks, adhesives, and caulking compounds, as a catalyst for the manufacture of certain polyurethanes, and as a fungicide in seed dressings and interior and exteri or paints (IARC 1993; Reese 1990). Dimethylmercury is used to prepare mercury nuclear magnetic res onance standards (Blayney et al. 1997) and mass spectrometer mercury calibration standards (Toribara et al. 1997). Discontinued applications . The use of phenylmercuric acetate as a fungicide in interior latex paints was banned in 1990 (Reese 1990), and its use in exterior pa int was banned in 1991 (Hefflin et al. 1993). Both of these bans were prompted because of releases of me rcury vapors as the paint degraded. Alkyl mercurialMERCURY 377 4. PRODUCTION, IMPORT /EXPORT, USE, AND DISPOSAL compounds were used until the mid-1970s as a treatment to disinfect grain seeds. Most other agricultural applications of mercury compounds in bactericides and fungicides have been banned due to the toxicity of mercury. Mercuric nitrate was used in the producti on of felt hats to hydrolyze rabbit fur. The use of mercury as a wood preservative has ceased due to the use of polyurethane (Drake 1981). 4.4 DISPOSAL Mercury is an element, and therefore its chemical structure cannot be further broken down. In its elemental form, mercury is highly toxic when inha led. Therefore, incineration of mercury is not recommended as a disposal method. Mercury-contai ning waste products include waste effluents from chloralkali plants and discarded mercury-containi ng mechanical and electrical devices (Carrico 1985). Under current federal guidelines, mercury and its compounds are cons idered hazardous substances, and various regulations are in effect to control the emission of mercury into the environment (especially organic compounds) (Carrico 1985). Emissions from mercury ore processing facilities and mercury cell chloralkali plants are limited to 2.3 kg/day/facility. Emissions of mercury from the incineration or drying of wastewater sludges is limited to 3.2 kg/day/f acility (EPA 1975a, 1975b). In addition, dumping wastes containing more than trace amounts of mercury is prohibited. Recycling of mercury-containing compounds is an impor tant method of disposal. Recycling (retorting) is a treatment for five categories of mercury wastes 7-1). From 1987 to 1991, annual producti on of mercury from old scrap averaged nearly 180 metric tons, equivalent to 16% of the average reported consumption during that period (Jasinski 1993). Virtually all mercury can be reclaimed from mercury ce ll chloralkali plants, electrical apparati, and control instruments when plants are dismantled or scrappe d (Carrico 1985). Increased recycling would decrease the mercury load from waste sites and treatment plan ts. As environmental concerns increase with respect to the disposal of mercury, the recovery by recycling and industrial processes will become a moresignificant source of domestic supply (Carrico 1985). Of the estimated 646,896 pounds of mercury reported in the Toxics Release Inventory (TRI) in 1991 to have been released to the environment, the larg est percentage (96%, or 619,310 pounds) was transferred off-site from 51 industrial processing facilities, and a nother 314 pounds were transf erred to publicly ownedMERCURY 378 4. PRODUCTION, IMPORT /EXPORT, USE, AND DISPOSAL treatment works (POTWs) (TRI91 1993) (see Section 5-2 for additional information). By comparison, in 1994, only 83,064 pounds of mercury (less than 14% of th e total reported in 1991) were released to the environment; and of this amount, 81% (67,480 pounds) was transferred off-site from 29 large processing facilities (TRI94 1996) and an estimated 15 pounds of mercury were released to POTWs (TRI94 1996). Again, by comparison, in 1996, only 84,772 pounds of mercury (less than 14% of the total reported in 1991) were released to the environment and of th is amount, 78% (66,573 pounds) was transferred off-site from 34 large processing facilities and an estimated 15 pounds of mercury were released to POTWs (TRI96 1998). Releases of mercury to each of these compartments\u2014the total environment, POTWs, andthe volume transferred off-site\u2014decreased dramatically (approximately 90%) in only 5 years. The data listed in the TRI should be used with caution, because only certain types of facilities are required to report (EPA 1996d). This is not an exhaustive list. A fac ility is required to report information to the Toxics Release Inventory only if the facility is a general ma nufacturing or processing facility with 10 or more full- time employees that produces, imports, or processes 75,000 or more pounds of any TRI chemical or thatuses more than 10,000 pounds of a TRI chemical in a calendar year. No additional information on trendsin disposal volume or on specific methods of disposal was located. In addition, unknown quantities of metallic mercury used in religious or ethnic ceremonies, rituals, and practices (see Sections 5.4.4, 5.6, and 5.7) may reach municipal landfill sites by being improperly disposed of in domestic garbage, or may reach POTWs by be ing improperly discarded into domestic toilets or sink drains (Johnson [in press]). A survey was conducted to determine the use patterns of elemental mercury in the Latin American and Caribbean communities in Ne w York City (Johnson [in press]). In a survey of 203 adults, about 54% used elemental mercury in va rious religious and ethnic practices. Of these users, 64% disposed of the mercury in household garbage, 27% flushed the mercury down the toilet, and 9% disposed of the mercury outdoors. It is commonly thought that the high mercury load found in sewage andgarbage in New York City comes from dental clinics; however, improper disposal of mercury by religious practitioners in the Latin American and Caribbean co mmunities may also contribute to this load (Johnson [in press]).MERCURY 379 5. POTENTIAL FOR HUMAN EXPOSURE 5.1 OVERVIEW Mercury occurs naturally as a mineral and is distri buted throughout the environment by both natural and anthropogenic processes. The natural global bio-geoc hemical cycling of mercury is characterized by degassing of the element from soils and surface waters , followed by atmospheric transport, deposition of mercury back to land and surface water, and sorpti on of the compound to soil or sediment particulates. Mercury deposited on land a nd open water is in part revolatilized back into the atmosphere. This emission, deposition, and revolatilization creates difficulties in tracing the movement of mercury to itssources. Major anthropogenic sources of mercury releases to the environment include mining andsmelting; industrial processes involving the use of mercury, including chlor-alkali production facilities; combustion of fossil fuels, primarily coal; produc tion of cement; and medical and municipal waste incinerators and industrial/c ommercial boilers (EPA 1996b). The element has three valence states and is found in th e environment in the metallic form and in the form of various inorganic and organic complexes. The ma jor features of the bio-geochemical cycle of mercury include degassing of mineral mercury from the lithosphe re and hydrosphere, long -range transport in the atmosphere, wet and dry deposition to land and surface water, sorption to soil and sediment particulates, revolatilization from land and surface water, and bio accumulation in both terrestrial and aquatic food chains. Potential sources of general popula tion exposure to mercury include inhalation of mercury vapors in ambient air, ingestion of drinking water and foods tuffs contaminated with mercury, and exposure to mercury through dental and medical treatments. Dietary intake is the most important source ofnonoccupational exposure to mercury, with fish a nd other seafood products being the dominant source of mercury in the diet. Most of the mercury consum ed in fish or other seafood is the highly absorbable methylmercury form. Intake of elemental mercury from dental amalgams is another major contributing source to the total mercury body burden in humans in the general population (WHO 1990, 1991). Because the two major sources of mercury body burden include dietary intake and intake from dental amalgams, mercury is present at low concentrations in a variety of human tissues. Mercury has been detected in blood, urine, human milk, and hair in individuals in the general population. Inhalation of MERCURY 380 5. POTENTIAL FOR HUMAN EXPOSURE mercury vapor in workplace atmospheres is the main route of occupational exposure to the compound. The most recent estimate (1983-1986) indicates that about 152,000 people, including over 50,000 women,are potentially exposed to mercury in workplace environments in the United States (RTECS 1998). Occupational exposure to mercury is highest in industr ies processing or using the element (e.g., chloralkali workers and individuals involved in the manufacturi ng of industrial instruments, thermometers, and fluorescent lights). Dentists and dental staff, house pain ters, chemists involved in the synthesis or analysis of environmental samples containing mercury, and i ndividuals involved in disposal or recycling of mercury-contaminated wastes are also at risk of exposure. Members of the general public with potentially high exposures include individuals who live in proximity to former mercury mining or production sites, sec ondary production (recycling) facilities, municipal or medical incinerators, or coal-fired power plants. Othe r populations at risk of exposure include recreational and subsistence fishers who routinely consume meals of fish that may be contaminated; subsistence hunters who routinely consume the meat and organ ti ssues of marine mammals or other feral wildlife species; individuals with a large number of dent al amalgams; pregnant women and nursing mothers (including their developing fetuses and breast-fed infa nts) who are exposed to mercury from dietary, medical, or occupational sources, or from mercur y spills; individuals who use consumer products containing mercury (e.g., traditional or herbal remedies, or cosmetics, including skin lightening creams);and individuals living or working in buildings where mercury-containing latex paints were used, or where intentional (religious or ethnic use) or unintentional mercury spills have occurred. Mercury (elemental) has been identified in 714 of the 1,467 hazardous waste sites on the NPL (HazDat 1998). The frequency of these sites can be seen in Fi gure 5-1. Of these sites, 705 are located in the contiguous United States, 6 are located in the Commonwea lth of Puerto Rico (not shown), 2 are located in the U.S. Virgin Islands (not shown), and 1 is located in Guam (not shown). Mercuric acetate, mercuric chloride, mercurous chloride, and dimethylmercury have been identified in 2, 3, 1, and 2 sites, respectively, of the 1,467 hazardous waste sites on the NPL (HazDat 1998). The frequency of these sites can be seen in Figures 5-2 through 5-5. All of these la tter sites are located in the contiguous United States. 5.2 RELEASES TO THE ENVIRONMENT Mercury is released to the environment by both na tural processes (e.g., volcanic activity and weathering of mercury-containing rocks) and anthropogenic sources. Anthropogenic releases are primarily to the MERCURY 386 5. POTENTIAL FOR HUMAN EXPOSURE atmosphere. According to the Toxic Chemical Release Inventory (TRI), in 1996, a total of 84,772 pounds of mercury were released to the environment (air, wa ter, soil, underground injection, and off-site transfer) from 31 large processing facilities (TRI96 1998). Table 5-1 lists the amounts released from thesefacilities. The amounts of mercury released to the various environmental compartments in 1996, 1994, and1991 are also compared in Table 5-2. It is noteworthy that the total environmental releases of mercuryhave decreased by about 90% from 1991 to 1996 from those production and processing facilities that are required to report their releases to TRI. The indi vidual quantities of mercury released to land, publicly owned treatment works (POTWs), and via off-site wast e transfer have decreased most substantially since 1991 by 90%, 95%, and 89% respectively. In contrast , releases to air, water, and underground injection have fluctuated over the past few years, but ove rall have remained relativ ely unchanged or declined slightly. The data listed in the TRI should be used with caution because only certain types of facilities are required to report (EPA 1996f). This is not an e xhaustive list. Manufacturing and processing facilities are required to report information to the Toxics Release I nventory only if they employ 10 or more full-time employees; if their facility is classified under Sta ndard Industrial Classification (SIC) codes 20 through 39; and if their facility produces, imports, or processes 25,000 or more pounds of any TRI chemical orotherwise uses more than 10,000 pounds of a TRI chemical in a calendar year (EPA 1996f). Nationwidemercury emissions from a variety of emission sources are discussed in detail in Sections 5.2.1 through5.2.3. 5.2.1 Air Mercury is a naturally occurring metal that is ubiqu itous in the environment. Mercury is released to environmental media by both natural processes and an thropogenic sources. Mercury ore is found in all classes of rocks, including limestone, calcareous shales, sa ndstone, serpentine, chert, andesite, basalt, and rhyolite. The normal concentration of mercury in i gneous and sedimentary rocks and minerals appears to be 10-50 ng/g (ppb) (Andersson 1979); however, contains 86.2% mercury (Stokinger 1981). Currently, the average mercur y level in the atmosphere is about 3 to 6 times higher than the estimated level in the preindustrial atmosphere (Mason et al. 1995). Results of several studies suggest increases in anthropogenic mercury emissions over time. Zillioux et al. (1993) used peatcores to estimate that present day deposition of mercur y is 2 to 3 times greater than preindustrial levels. Lindqvist (1991c) estimated that sediment concentr ations in Swedish lakes are 5 times higher than background levels from precolonial times. Travis and Bl aylock (1992) reported that mercury levels in tree MERCURY 389 5. POTENTIAL FOR HUMAN EXPOSURE rings, as well as in soil and sediment cores, suggest that a four- to five-fold increase in mercury levels in air has occurred since the beginning of the industrial revolution. A degree of uncertainty exists with respect to es timates of the relative contributions of natural and anthropogenic sources of mercury emissions to the environment reported in the scientific literature. Nriagu and Pacnya (1988) estimated anthropogenic emissi ons to be more than half of the total global emissions of 6,000 tons/year. Nriagu (1989) estimated mercury emissions from natural sources to be 2,500 tons/year. In contrast, WHO (1990, 1991) reported that the major source of atmospheric mercury is global degassing of mineral mercury from the lithosphere a nd hydrosphere at an estimated rate of 2,700-6,000 metric tons/year, which is approximately 1.3 to 3 times the rate of release from anthropogenic sources. Lindqvist (1991b) estimated world anthropogenic emissi ons at 4,500 tons with an additional 3,000 tons attributed to natural sources. Most recently, Pirrone et al. (1996) estimated world emissions of mercury at2,200 metric tons/year and concluded that natura l sources, industrial sources, and the recycling of anthropogenic mercury each contribute about one-third of the current mercury burden in the global atmosphere. A major source of the uncertainty is that emissions from terrestrial and marine systemsinclude a \"recycled\" anthropogenic source component (WHO 1990). Recent estimates of anthropogenic releases of mercur y to the atmosphere range from 2,000-4,500 metric tons/year, mostly from the mining and smelting of me rcury and other metal sulfide ores. An estimated 10,000 metric tons of mercury are mined each year, a lthough there is considerable year-to-year variation (WHO 1990). Other anthropogenic sources include: industrial processes involving the use of mercury,including chloralkali manufacturing facilities; combus tion of fossil fuels, primarily coal; production of cement; and medical and municipal waste incinerati on and commercial/ industrial boilers (Bache 1991). Stein et al. (1996) estimated that approximately 80% of the anthropogenic sources of mercury are emissions of elemental mercury to the air, primarily from fossil fuel combustion, mining, smelting, andfrom solid waste incineration. Another 15% of the an thropogenic emissions occur via direct application of fertilizers and fungicides and municipal solid wast e (e.g., batteries and thermometers) to the land. Recently, Carpi et al. (1998) studied the contaminati on of sludge-amended soil with inorganic and methyl- mercury and the subsequent emission of this mercur y contamination into the atmosphere. These authors reported the routine application of municipal sewage sludge to crop land significantly increased theconcentration of both total mercury and methylme rcury in surface soil from 80 to 6,1000 \u00b5/kg (ppb) and 0.3 to 8.3 \u00b5/kg (ppb), respectively. Both inorga nic and methylmercury were transported from the MERCURY 390 5. POTENTIAL FOR HUMAN EXPOSURE sludge/soil matrix to the environment by emission to the atmosphere. An additional 5% of mercury emissions occur via direct discharge of industrial e ffluent to bodies of water. Mercury emissions from coal-fired power plants are almost exclusively in the vapor phase (98%) (Germani and Zoller 1988). Brown et al. (1993) reported that 79-87% of mercury c ontained in coal was released with the flue gas at coal-fired power plants. These authors monitored emissions from plants using sub-bituminous C (low sulfur), lignite (medium sulfur), and bituminous (both low- and high-sulfur) coals. Anthropogenic emissions, mainly from combustion of fossil fuels, account for about 25% of mercury emissions to theatmosphere (WHO 1990). These mercury emissions ev entually may be deposited on the surrounding soil, although soil concentrations have not been correlated with distance or direction from such plants (Sato and Sada 1992). Other potential emission sources incl ude copper and zinc sm elting operations, paint applications, waste oil combustion (EPA 1987f), geot hermal energy plants (Baldi 1988), crematories (Nieschmidt and Kim 1997; WHO 1991), and incineration of agricultural wastes (Mariani et al. 1992). The incineration of medical waste has been found to release up to 12.3 mg/m 3 of mercury (Glasser et al. 1991). Medical wastes may release approximately 110 mercury mg/kg of uncontrolled emissions from medical waste incinerators, compared with 25.5 merc ury mg/kg general municipal waste, indicating that medical equipment may be a significant source of atmospheric mercury. The use of scrubbers on theincinerators may remove up to 51% of the mercur y emissions (Walker and Cooper 1992). Other potential emission sources of mercury emissions to the air include slag from metal production, fires at wastedisposal sites, and diffuse emissions from other an thropogenic sources, such as dentistry and industrial activities. The anthropogenic mercury contributions ar e greater in the northern hemisphere than in the southern hemisphere, and are greatest in heavily industrialized areas. Balogh and Liang (1995) conducted a 9-week sampling and analysis program to determine the fate of mercury entering a large municipal wastewater treatment plant. Mercury removal in primary treatmentaveraged 79%; and the average removal across th e entire plant was 96%. Mercury loading on the secondary treatment (activated sludge) process was elevated to near plant influent levels due to recycling of the spent scrubber water from the sewage sludge incinera tor control equipment. This internal recycling of the spent incinerator scrubber water resulted in elev ated mercury loadings to the incinerator and reduced the mercury control efficiency to near zero. Measu rements indicated that publicly owned treatment works (POTWs) can remove mercury from wastewater very effectively; however, approximately 95% of the mercury entering the plant was ultimately discharged to the atmosphere via sludge incineration emissions. MERCURY 391 5. POTENTIAL FOR HUMAN EXPOSURE Bullock (1997) used the Regional Lagrangian Model of Air Pollution (RELMAP) to simulate the emission, transport, chemical transformation, and wet and dry deposition of elemental mercury gas, divalent mercury gas, and particulate mercury from various point and area source types to develop an atmospheric mercury emissions inventory by anthropogenic source type. The results of the RELMAP model are shown in Table 5-3. On a percentage basis, various com bustion processes (medical waste incinerators, municipal waste incinerators, electric utility power production [fossil fuel burning] and non-utility power and heat generation) account for 83% of all anthropogenic emissions in the United States. Overall, of the emissions produced, 41% were associated with elemental mercury vapor (Hgo), 41% with the mercuric form (Hg2+), and 18% was mercury associated with particulates. A more detailed estimate of national mercury emission rates for various categories of sources is shown in Table 5-4. As shown in this table, point sources of anthropogenic mercury emissions appear to represent the greatest contribution of mercury releases, with combustion sources representing 85% of all emissions. According to the most recent Toxics Release Invent ory (Table 5-1), in 1996, the estimated releases of 17,097 pounds of mercury to the air from 31 large pr ocessing facilities accounted for about 20% of annual environmental releases for this element (TRI96 1998). This is slightly more (13%) than the estimated 13,885 pounds that were released to the air in 1994 (TRI94 1996), but 35% less than the 21,288 poundsreleased to the air in 1991 (Table 5-2). The TRI da ta listed in Tables 5-1 a nd 5-2 should be used with some caution, since only certain types of facilities are required to report (EPA 1996f). This is not anexhaustive list. Mercury has been identified in air samples collected at 25 of the 714 NPL hazardous waste sites where it has been detected in at least one environmental medium (HazDat 1998). 5.2.2 Water Natural weathering of mercury-bearing minerals in igneous rocks is estimated to directly release about 800 metric tons of mercury per year to surface waters of the earth (Gavis and Ferguson 1972). Atmospheric deposition of elemental mercury fro m both natural and anthropogenic sources has been identified as an indirect source of mercury to su rface waters (WHO 1991). Mercury associated with soils can be directly washed into surface waters during ra in events. Surface runoff is an important mechanism for transporting mercury from soil into surface waters, pa rticularly for soils with high humic content (Meili MERCURY 395 5. POTENTIAL FOR HUMAN EXPOSURE 1991). Mercury may also be released to surface wate rs in effluents from a number of industrial processes, including chloralkali production, mining operations and ore processing, metallurgy and electroplating, chemical manufacturing, ink manufacturing, pulp and paper mills, leather tanning, pharmaceuticalproduction, and textile manufacture (Dean et al . 1972; EPA 1971c). Discharges from a regional wastewater treatment facility on the St. Louis River that received primarily municipal wastes contained0.364 \u00b5g/L (ppb) of mercury, resulting in concentrati ons in the adjacent sediment of up to 5.07 \u00b5g/g (ppm) (Glass et al. 1990). Industrial effluents from a chemical manufacturing plant on the NPL (StaufferChemical's LeMoyne, Alabama site) contained more than 10 ppm of mercury; these effluents hadcontaminated an adjacent swamp and watershed with mercury concentrations in the sediments ranging from 4.3 to 316 ppm (Hayes and Rodenbeck 1992). Effl uent monitoring data collected under the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) Progr am were used to estimate pollutant loadings from effluent discharges to the San Francisco Bay Estu ary between 1984 and 1987 (Davis et al. 1992). Of the 1,030 samples of industrial effluents monitored enteri ng the San Francisco Estuary during this period, 39% were found to contain mercury (Davis et al. 1992). Although these authors did not specify the limits of detection for mercury and did not pr ovide quantitative information on the concentrations detected, they did indicate that measurements for most of the priority pollutants including mercury were at or below thedetection limit. This precluded quantitative assessment of spatial and temporal trends in calculating loadings to the estuary for all but four metals (Davis et al. 1992). According to the most recent Toxics Release Inventory, in 1996, the estimated releases of 541 pounds of mercury to water from 31 large processing facilities acc ounted for about 0.64% of total environmental releases for this element (TRI96 1998). An addition 15 pounds of mercury were released indirectly to POTWs, and some of this volume ultimately may have been released to surface waters. This is approximately 215 pounds more mercury than was released to water directly or indirectly via POTWs in 1994 (TRI94 1996), but 445 pounds less than that rel eased to water either directly (144 pounds) or indirectly via POTWs (301 pounds) in 1991 (TRI91 1993). The TRI data listed in Tables 5-1 and 5-2 should be used with some caution, since only certain types of facilities are required to report (EPA 1996f). This is not an exhaustive list. Mercury has been identified in surface water, groundw ater, and leachate samples collected at 197, 395, and 58 sites, respectively, of the 714 NPL hazardous w aste sites where it has b een detected in some environmental media (HazDat 1998).MERCURY 396 5. POTENTIAL FOR HUMAN EXPOSURE 5.2.3 Soil Atmospheric deposition of mercury from both natural and anthropogenic sources has been identified as an indirect source of mercury to soil and sediments (Sato and Sada 1992; WHO 1990, 1991). Mercury is released to cultivated soils through the direct applica tion of inorganic and organic fertilizers (e.g., sewage sludge and compost), lime, and fungicides contai ning mercury (Andersson 1979). Recent interest in community recycling of sewage sludge and yard com post may result in increased releases of mercury from these wastes. Sewage sludge contained approxima tely 20 times more mercury than yard compost (2.90 ppm versus 0.15 ppm) (Lisk et al. 1992a); munici pal solid waste contained the highest concentration (3.95 ppm) (Lisk et al. 1992b). Recently, Carpi et al . (1998) studied the contamination of sludge-amended soil with inorganic and methylmercury and the em ission of this mercury contamination into the atmosphere. These authors reported the routine a pplication of municipal sewage sludge to crop land significantly increased the concentration of both tota l mercury and methylmercury in surface soil from 6,1000 \u00b5g/kg and methylmercury were transported from the sludge/soil matrix to the environment by emission to the atmosphere. Additional anthropogenic releases of mercury to soil are expected as a result of the disposal of industrial and domestic solid waste products (e.g., thermometers, electrical switches, and batteries) to landfills (see Table 5-5). Another source of mercury releases to so il is the disposal of municipal incinerator ash in landfills (Mumma et al. 1990). In 1987, nationwide c oncentrations of mercury present in the ash from municipal waste incineration ranged from 0.03 to 25 ppm (Mumma et al. 1990). Such releases may exhibit a seasonal variability. For example, fly ash collected prior to Christmas contained significantly less mercury (6.5 ppm) than ash collected after Chri stmas (45-58 ppm), possibly as a result of the increased use and disposal of batteries containing mercury in toys and other equipment during this season (Mumma et al. 1991). Emission sources include stack em issions, ashes collected at the stack, ashes from electrostatic precipitators, and in slags (Morselli et al. 1992). An analysis of mercury concentrations in soil, refuse combustibles, and bottom and fly ash from incinerators showed increasing concentrations of 0, 2, 4, and 100 mg/kg (ppm), respectively (Goldin et al. 1992). According to the Toxics Release Inventory, in 1996, the estimated releases of 537 pounds of mercury to land from 31 large processing facilities accounted for a bout 0.63% of the total 1996 environmental releases for this element (TRI96 1998). In addition, an estimated 9 pounds of mercury (<0.01% of total environmental releases) were released via underground in jection (see Table 5-1). This is approximately MERCURY 398 5. POTENTIAL FOR HUMAN EXPOSURE 57% of the mercury that was released to soil in 1994 (TRI94 1996) and is only 10% of the mercury released to soil in 1991 (see Table 5-2). The TRI data listed in Tables 5-1 and 5-2 should be used with some caution, since only certain types of facilities are required to report (EPA 1996f). This is not anexhaustive list. Mercury has been identified in soil and sediment sam ples collected at 350 and 208 sites, respectively, of the 714 NPL hazardous waste sites where it has been detected in some environmental media (HazDat 1998). 5.3 ENVIRONMENTAL FATE The natural global bio-geochemical cycling of mercur y is characterized by degassing of the element from soils and surface waters, followed by atmospheric tr ansport, deposition of mercury back to land and surface waters, and sorption of the compound to soil or sediment particulates. Mercury deposited on land and open water is in part revolatilized back into the atmosphere. This emission, deposition, and revolatilization creates difficulties in tracing the movement of mercury to its sources (WHO 1990). Particulate-bound mercury can be converted to insol uble mercury sulfide and precipitated or bioconverted into more volatile or soluble forms that re-enter the atmosphere or are bioaccumulated in aquatic and terrestrial food chains (EPA 1984b). 5.3.1 Transport and Partitioning Mercury has three valence states. The specific st ate and form in which the compound is found in an environmental medium is dependent upon a number of factors, including the redox potential and pH of the medium. The most reduced form is metallic or elemental mercury, which is a liquid at ambienttemperatures, but readily vaporizes. Over 95% of th e mercury found in the atmosphere is gaseous mercury (Hg 0), the form involved in long-range (global) transpor t of the element. Residence time in the atmosphere has been estimated to range from 6 days (A ndren and Nriagu 1979) to 2 years (EPA 1984b). Approximately 5% of atmospheric mercury is associ ated with particulates, which have a shorter atmospheric residence time, are removed by dry or wet deposition, and may show a regional or local distribution pattern (Nater and Grigal 1992). Atmospheric inputs may be more significant in areas whereother sources of contamination, such as contaminated ri vers, are less important or nonexistent (Kelly et al. 1991). Although local sources are important, a 72-hour travel time trajectory for mercury indicates thatsome mercury found in rain may originate from sources up to 2,500 km (1,550 miles) away (Glass et al.MERCURY 399 5. POTENTIAL FOR HUMAN EXPOSURE 1991). Over the last 140 years, the atmospheric mercur y concentrations have increased by a factor of 3.7, or approximately 2% per year (Swain et al. 1992). Metallic mercury released in vapor form to the atmo sphere can be transported long distances before it is converted to other forms of mercury, and wet a nd dry deposition processes return it to land and water surfaces. Dry deposition may account for approximate ly 70% of the total atmospheric deposition of mercury during the summer, although on an annual b asis, wet and dry deposition may be of equal importance (Lindberg et al. 1991). Up to 22% of the annual input of mercury to Lake Erie is from dry deposition of mercury-containing atmo spheric particles or from precipitation (Kelly et al. 1991). Wet deposition is the primary method of removal of mercury from the atmosphere (approximately 66%) (Fitzgerald et al. 1991; Lindqvist 1991c) and may account for virtually all of the mercury content in remote lakes that do not receive inputs from other s ources (e.g., industrial effluents) (Hurley et al. 1991; Swain et al. 1992). Most inert mercury (Hg+2) in precipitation is bound to aerosol particulates, which are relatively immobile when deposited on soil or water (M eili et al. 1991). Mercury is also present in the atmosphere to a limited extent in unidentified soluble forms associated with particulate matter. In addition to wet and dry deposition processes, mercury may also be removed from the atmosphere by sorption of the vapor form to soil or water surfaces (EPA 1984b). In soils and surface waters, mercury can exist in the mercuric (Hg+2) and mercurous (Hg+1) states as a ions with varying water solub ilities. Mercuric mercury, present as complexes and chelates with ligands, is probably the predominant form of mercury present in surface waters. The transport and partitioning of mercury in surface waters and soils is influenced by the particular form of the compound. More than 97% of the dissolved gaseous mercury found in water consists of elemental mercury (Vandal et al. 1991). Volatile forms (e.g., me tallic mercury and dimethylmercury) are expected to evaporate to the atmosphere, whereas solid forms partiti on to particulates in the soil or water column and are transported downward in the water column to the sediments (Hurley et al. 1991). Vaporization of mercury from soils may be controlled by temperatur e, with emissions from contaminated soils being greater in warmer weather when soil microbial reduction of Hg+2 to the more volatile elemental mercury is greatest (Lindberg et al. 1991). Vapor-phase mercur y volatilized from surface waters has been measured (Schroeder and Fanaki 1988); however, the dominant process controlling the distribution of mercurycompounds in the environment appears to be the sorption of nonvolatile forms to soil and sediment particulates, with little resuspension from the sediments back into the water column (Bryan and Langston 1992). Cossa et al. (1988) found that 70% of the dissolved mercury in St. Lawrence River water was MERCURY 400 5. POTENTIAL FOR HUMAN EXPOSURE associated with organic matter. The authors repor ted that the removal mechanism was flocculation of organic mercury colloids in freshwater. Methylme rcury and other mercury fractions are strongly bound to organic matter in water and may be transported in runoff water from contaminated lakes to other surface waters and soils (Lee and Iverfeldt 1991). Small am ounts (2-4 ng/L [ppt]) of mercury are able to move from contaminated groundwater into overlying lakes, with concentrations reaching a maximum near the sediment/water interface; however, since most of the mercury in the groundwater is derived from atmospheric sources, this low value indicates that most of the mercury deposited on soil (92-96% of the 10.3 \u00b5g/m2/year of mercury deposited) is absorbed to the soil and does not leach down into the groundwater (Krabbenhoft and Babiarz 1992). The sorption process has been found to be related to the organic matter content of the soil or sediment. Mercury is strongly sorbed to humic materials and ses quioxides in soil at a pH higher than 4 (Blume and Brummer 1991) and to the surface layer of peat (Lode nius and Autio 1989). Mercury has been shown to volatilize from the surface of more acidic soils (i.e., soil pH of less than 3.0) (Warren and Dudas 1992). Adsorption of mercury in soil is decreased with increasi ng pH and/or chloride ion concentrations (Schuster 1991). Mercury is sorbed to soil with high iron a nd aluminum content up to a maximum loading capacity of 15 g/kg (15,000 ppm) (Ahmad and Qureshi 1989). Inor ganic mercury sorbed to particulate material is not readily desorbed. Thus, freshwater and marine sediments are important repositories for inorganic forms of the element, and leaching is a relatively in significant transport process in soils. However, surface runoff is an important mechanism for moving mercury fro m soil to water, particularly for soils with high humic content (Meili 1991). Mobilization of sorbed mercury from particulates can occur through chemical or biological reduction to elemental mercury and bioconversion to volatile organic forms (Andersson 1979; Callahan et al. 1979; EPA 1984b). Metallic merc ury may move through the top 3-4 cm of dry soil at atmospheric pressure; however, it is unlikely that further penetration would occur (Eichholz et al. 1988). The volatilization and leaching of various forms of merc ury (elemental, mercuric sulfide, mercuric oxide, and mercurous oxide) from soils or wastes was exam ined using the headspace method for volatilization and the Resource and Conservation Recovery Act ( RCRA) leaching protocols for leaching through soil to determine if the leachates exceeded the RCRA limit of 200 \u00b5g/L (ppb) (Willett et al. 1992). With the exception of mercuric sulfide, the other forms of mercury increased in concen trations in the headspace vapor and in the leachate as the soil concentr ations increased, although the elemental mercury concentrations never exceeded the RCRA limit, indi cating that it was relatively unleachable. Mercuric sulfide also did not exceed the background level for the leachate and was consistently less thanMERCURY 401 5. POTENTIAL FOR HUMAN EXPOSURE 0.001 mg/m3 for the vapor concentrations, indicating that it was also nonleachable and did not readily volatilize. This study also showed that concentrati ons of mercury in leachate could not be correlated with the concentration of mercury in the soil or in the headspace vapors (Willett et al. 1992). Mercuric sulfide has been found to strongly adsorb to soil, and ev en with weathering, any mercury released from the mercuric sulfide is readsorbed by the soil (Harsh and Doner 1981). The most common organic form of mercury, methylmerc ury, is soluble, mobile, and quickly enters the aquatic food chain. This form of mercury is accumula ted to a greater extent in biological tissue than are inorganic forms of mercury (Riisgard and Hansen 1990). Methylmercury in surface waters is rapidly accumulated by aquatic organisms; concentrations in carnivorous fish (e.g., pike, shark, and swordfish) at the top of both freshwater and marine food chains are biomagnified on the order of 10,000-100,000 times the concentrations found in ambient waters (C allahan et al. 1979; EPA 1984b; WHO 1990, 1991). The range in experimentally determined bioconcentration factor (BCF) values is shown in Table 5-6. The bioaccumulation potential for methylmercury in fish is influenced by the pH of the water, with a greater bioaccumulation seen in waters with lower pH (Pon ce and Bloom 1991). Mercury concentrations in fish have also been negatively correlated with other wa ter quality factors, such as alkalinity and dissolved oxygen content (Wren 1992). The biomagnification of methylmercury has been dem onstrated by the elevated levels found in piscivorous fish compared with fish at lower levels of the food chain (Jackson 1991; Kohler et al. 1990; Porcella 1994; Watras and Bloom 1992). Biomagnification factors for methylmercury in the food webs of Lake Ontario were lowest for the transfer of methylmercury from mysids to amphipods (1.1), to (2.4); were intermedia te for the transfer from mysids to fish (5.1) and amphipods to fish (6.5); and were highest for the tran sfer from plankton to fish (10.4) (Evans et al. 1991). (The biomagnification of methylmercury from water through several trophic levels is compared to the biomagnification of inorganic mercury in Tabl e 5-7.) Watras and Bloom (1992) reported that biomagnification of methylmercury in Little Rock La ke seems to be a result of two processes: the higher affinity of inorganic mercury in lower trophic level organisms and the high affinity of methylmercury in fish. Fish appear to accumulate methylmercury from both food sources and the water column. However, Hall et al. (1997) found that food was the predominant source of mercury uptake in fish. The biologicalconcentration factor (BCF) of methylmercury in fish in Little Rock Lake was three million (Porcella1994). Mason et al. (1995) also compared bioaccumu lation of inorganic mercury and methylmercury. These authors showed that passive upt ake of the mercury complexes (HgCl 2 and CH3HgCl) results in high MERCURY 404 5. POTENTIAL FOR HUMAN EXPOSURE concentrations of both the inorganic and methylated mercury in phytoplankton. However, differences in partitioning within phytoplankton ce lls between inorganic mercury (which is principally membrane- bound) and methylmercury (which accumulated in the cytoplasm) lead to a greater assimilation ofmethylmercury during zooplankton grazing. Most of the discrimination between inorganic and methylmercury thus occurs during trophic transfer, while the major enrichment factor is between water a nd the phytoplankton. This also has been reported for the diatom Thalassiosura weissflogii in a marine food chain (Mason et al. 1996). Methylmercury was accumulated in the cell cytoplasm, and its assimilation by copepods was 4 times more efficient than the assimilation of inorganic mercury. Bioaccumulation has been demonstrated for predator fish in bothfreshwater and marine systems and in marine mammals (see Section 5.4.4). Bioaccumulation ofmethylmercury in aquatic food chains is of interest , because it is generally the most important source of nonoccupational human exposure to th is compound (EPA 1984b; WHO 1990, 1991). Aquatic macrophytes have been found to bioconcentrate methylmercury in almost direct proportion to the mercury concentration in the water (Ribeyre et al. 1991). Mortimer (1985) reported bioconcentration factors (BCFs) for several species of submerged aquatic plants exposed to inorganic mercury in laboratory aquaria of 3,300, 1.3, 0.9, and , Najas , and Nitella , respectively. The concentrations factor used by this author was based on \u00b5g g -1 dry weight in the plant/\u00b5g mL-1 water day -1. The potential for bioaccumulation in terrestrial food chains is demonstrated by the uptake of mercury by the edible mushroom Pleurotus ostreatus , grown on compost containing merc ury at concentrations of up to 0.2 mg/kg (ppm). The bioaccumulation factors repor ted ranged from 65 to 140, indicating that there are potential risks to human health if these mushroom s are eaten in large quantities (Bressa et al. 1988). Elevated concentrations of mercury in 149 samples of mushrooms representing 11 different species werereported by Kalcac et al. (1991). These authors collected mushrooms within 6 km of a lead smelter inCzechoslovakia in operation since 1786. Mercury was accumulated by Lepista nuda and 11.9 mg/kg (ppm) and 6.5 mg/kg (ppm) (dry weight), respectively. The mean concentration of other species ranged from 0.3 to 2.4 mg/kg (ppm). Concentrations of mercury in most of the mushroom speciescollected in that location were higher than in mu shrooms collected in other parts of the country. Data from higher plants indicate that virtually no merc ury is taken up from the soil into the shoots of plants such as peas, although mercury concentrations in the roots may be significantly elevated and reflect theMERCURY 405 5. POTENTIAL FOR HUMAN EXPOSURE mercury concentrations of the surrounding soil (Lindqvi st 1991e). In a study by Granato et al. (1995), municipal solid waste sludge mercury concentrations from the Metropolitan Water Reclamation District of Greater Chicago were found to range from 1.1 to 8.5 mg/kg (ppm), with a mean concentration of 3.3 mg/kg (ppm). From 1971 to 1995, sludge applica tions were made to a Fulton County, Illinois sludge utilization site. About 80-100% of the mercury app lied to the soils in sewage sludge since 1971 still resided in the top 15 cm of soil. These authors reported that sewage sludge applications did not increaseplant tissue mercury concentrations in corn or wheat raised on the sludge utilization site. Earthworms, Lumbricus sp ., bioaccumulate mercury under laborat ory and field conditions in amounts which are dependent on soil concentrations and exposure duration (Cocking et al. 1994). Maximum mercury tissue concentrations in laboratory cultu res were only 20% of the 10-14.8 \u00b5g/g (ppm) (dry weight) observed in individual worms collected from contaminated soils (21 \u00b5g/g) on the South Riverflood plain at Waynesboro, Virginia. Bioconcentra tion occurred under field conditions in uncontaminated control soil (0.2 \u00b5g Hg/g); however, total tissue me rcury concentrations (0.4-0.8 \u00b5g/g dry weight) were only 1-5% of those for earthworms collected on contam inated soils. Uptake by the earthworms appeared to be enhanced in slightly acidic soils (pH 5.9-6.0) in laboratory cultures. Soil and earthworm tissue mercury contents were positively correlated under both field and labor atory conditions. Predation of earthworms contaminated with mercury could pass th e contamination to such predators as moles and ground feeding birds, such as robins (Cocking et al. 1994). 5.3.2 Transformation and Degradation Mercury is transformed in the environment by bio tic and abiotic oxidation a nd reduction, bioconversion of photolysis of organom ercurials. Inorganic mercury can be methylated by microorganisms indigenous to soils, fresh water, and salt water. This process is mediated by various microbial populations under both aerobic and anaerobic c onditions. The most probable mechanism for this reaction involves the nonenzymatic methylation of me rcuric mercury ions by methylcobalamine compounds produced as a result of bacterial synthesis. Merc ury forms stable complexes with organic compounds. Monoalkyl mercury compounds (e.g., methylmercuric chloride) are relatively soluble; however, the solubility of methylmercury is decreased with increasi ng dissolved organic carbon content, indicating that it is bound by organic matter in water (Miskimmin 1991) . Dialkyl mercury compounds (e.g., dimethyl- mercury) et al . 1979; EPA 1984b). Dimethylmercury is volatile, although it makes up less than 3% of the dissolved gaseous mercury found in water (Andersson et al. 1990; MERCURY 406 5. POTENTIAL FOR HUMAN EXPOSURE Vandal et al. 1991). The major pathways for transf ormation of mercury and various mercury compounds in air, water, and soil are shown in Figure 5-6. 5.3.2.1 Air The primary form of atmospheric mercury, metallic mercury vapor (Hg0), is oxidized by ozone to other forms (e.g., Hg+2) and is removed from the atmosphere by precipitation (Brosset and Lord 1991). The oxidation/reduction of mercury with dissolved oz one, hydrogen peroxide, hypochlorite entities, or organoperoxy compounds or radicals may also occur in the atmosphere (Schroeder et al. 1991). The overall residence time of elemental mercury in the atmosphere has been estimated to be 6 days to 2 years, although in clouds, a fast oxidation reaction on the order of hours may occur between elemental mercury and ozone. Some mercury compounds, such as mercuric sulfide, are quite stable in the atmosphere as a result of their binding to particles in the aerosol phase (Lindqvist 1991b). Other mercury compounds, such as mercurichydroxide (Hg[OH] 2), which may be found in the aqueous phase of the atmosphere (e.g., rain), are rapidly reduced to monovalent mercury in sunlight (M unthe and McElroy 1992). The main atmospheric transformation process for organomercurials appear s to be photolysis (EPA 1984b; Johnson and Bramen 1974; Williston 1968). 5.3.2.2 Water The most important transformation process in the e nvironmental fate of mercury in surface waters is biotransformation. Photolysis of organomercurials may also occur in surface waters, but the significance of this process in relation to biotransforma tion is not clear (Callahan et al. 1979). Any form of mercury entering surface waters can be mi crobially converted to methylmercuric ions, given favorable conditions. Sulfur-reducing bacteria are res ponsible for most of the mercury methylation in the environment (Gilmour and Henry 1991), with anaerobi c conditions favoring their activity (Regnell and Tunlid 1991). Yeasts, such as Candida albicans and Saccharomyces cerevisiae , whose growth is favored by low pH conditions, are able to methylate mercury a nd are also able to reduce ionic mercury to elemental mercury (Yannai et al. 1991). Methyl cobalamine co mpounds produced by bacterial synthesis appear to be involved in the nonenzymatic methyl ation of inorganic mercury ions (Regnell and Tunlid 1991). The rate of methylmercury formation by this process is la rgely determined by the concentration of methyl cobalamine compounds, inorganic mercur ic ions, and the oxygen concentrati on of the water, with the rate MERCURY 408 5. POTENTIAL FOR HUMAN EXPOSURE increasing as the conditions become anaerobic. Vola tile elemental mercury may be formed through the demethylation of methylmercury or the reduction of inorganic mercury, with anaerobic conditions again favoring the demethylation of the methylmercury (B arkay et al. 1989; Callahan et al. 1979; Regnell and Tunlid 1991). Increased dissolved organic carbon leve ls reduce methylation of mercury in the water column (Gilmour and Henry 1991), possibly as a result of the binding of free mercury ions to the dissolvedorganic carbon at low pH, thus reducing their availab ility for methylation, or the dissolved organic carbon may inhibit the methylating bacteria (Miskimmin et al . 1992). Alternatively, low pH favors the methylation of mercury in the water column, particularly in aci d deposition lakes, while inhibiting its demethylation (Gilmour and Henry 1991). It has also been shown that the methylation rate is not affected by addition of sulfate in softwater lakes (Kerry et al. 1991). At a pH of 4-9 and a normal sulfide concentration, me rcury will form mercuric sulfide. This compound is relatively insoluble in aqueous solution (11\u00d710 -17 ppb), and therefore it will precipitate out and remove mercury ions from the water, reducing the availab ility of mercury to fish. Under acidic conditions, however, the activity of the sulfide ion decreases, thus inhibiting the formation of mercuric sulfide and favoring the formation of methylmercury (Bjornberg et al. 1988). Low pH and high mercury sediment concentrations favor the formation of methylmercury, which has greater bioavailability potential for aquatic organisms than inorganic mercury compounds. Methyl mercury may be ingested by aquatic organisms lower in the food chain, such as yellow perch, which in turn are consumed by piscivorous fish higher on food chain (Cope et al. 1990; Wiener et al. 1990). Merc ury cycling occurs in freshwater lakes, with the concentrations and speciation of the mercury being dependent on limnological features and water stratification. Surface waters may be saturated with volatile elemental mercury, whereas sediments are the primary source of the mercury in surface waters. During the summer months, surface concentrations ofmethyl and elemental mercury decline as a result of ev aporation, although they rema in relatively constant in deeper waters (Bloom and Effler 1990). Abiotic reduction of inorganic mercury to metallic merc ury in aqueous systems can also occur, particularly in the presence of soluble humic substances (i.e., acidi c waters containing humic and fulvic acids). This reduction process is enhanced by light, occurs under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions, and is inhibited by competition from chloride ions (Allard and Arsenie 1991).MERCURY 409 5. POTENTIAL FOR HUMAN EXPOSURE 5.3.2.3 Sediment and Soil Mercury compounds in soils may undergo the same chemical and biological transformations described for surface waters. Mercuric mercury usually forms vari ous complexes with chloride and hydroxide ions in soils; the specific complexes formed depend on the pH, salt content, and composition of the soil solution. Formation and degradation of organi c mercurials in soils appear to be mediated by the same types of microbial processes occurring in surface waters and may also occur through abiotic processes (Andersson 1979). Elevated levels of chloride ions reduce meth ylation of mercury in river sediments, sludge, and soil (Olson et al. 1991), although increased levels of orga nic carbon and sulfate ions increase methylation in sediments (Gilmour and Henry 1991). and estuarine ecosystems, the presence of chloride ions (0.02 M) may accelerate the release of mercury from sediments (Wang et al. 1991). In the late 1950s, unknown quantities of mercuric nitrat e and elemental mercury were released into East Fork Poplar Creek from a government facility in Oa k Ridge, Tennessee. Total mercury concentrations in the flood plain soil along the creek ranged from 0.5 to 3,000 ppm (Revis et al. 1989). An estimated170,000 pounds of that mercury remained in floodplain soil of the creek (DOE 1994). The form of thatmercury has been reported to be primarily mercur ic sulfide (85-88%), with 6-9% present as elemental mercury (Revis et al. 1989, 1990). A very small amount was detected in the form of methylmercury (lessthan 0.02%). The reported presence of the mercuric sulfide suggests that the predominant biological reaction in soil for mercury is the reduction of Hg +2 to mercuric sulfide by sulfate-reducing bacteria under anaerobic conditions (Revis et al. 1989, 1990). Mercuric sulfide has very limited water solubility (4.5\u00d710-24 mol/L), and thus, in the absence of other solvents, is likely to have limited mobility in soil. Aerobic microorganisms can solubilize Hg+2 from mercuric sulfide by oxidizing the sulfide through sulfite to sulfate, with the Hg+2 being reduced to elemental mercury (Wood 1974) . However, examination of the weathering of mercuric sulfide indicated that mercuric su lfide does not undergo significant weathering when bound to riverwash soil with a pH of 6.8, although degradation may be increased in the presence of chloride and iron (Harsh and Doner 1981). Mercury, frequently present in mine tailings, was toxic to bacteria isolated from a marsh treatment system used to treat municipal waste waters. The minimum c oncentration that inhibited the bacteria (as determined by intracellular ATP levels) was approximately 0.07\u00b10.15 mg/L (ppm) (Desjardins et al. 1988). MERCURY 410 5. POTENTIAL FOR HUMAN EXPOSURE 5.4 LEVELS MONITORED OR ESTIMATED IN THE ENVIRONMENT Reliable evaluation of the potential for human e xposure to mercury and various mercury compounds depends in part on the reliability of supporting anal ytical data from environmental samples and biological specimens. Concentrations of mercury in unpolluted at mospheres and in pristine surface waters are often so low as to be near the limits of detection of current an alytical methods even for determining total mercury. In reviewing data on mercury levels monitored or estimated in the environment, it should also be noted that the amount of chemical identified analytically is not necessarily equivalent to the amount that isbioavailable. The analytical methods available for monitoring mercury and vari ous inorganic and organic mercury compounds in a variety of environmental media are discussed in Chapter 6. 5.4.1 Air Indoor air mercury concentrations were determined in 37 houses in Ohio that had been painted with latex paint (Beusterien et al. 1991). Of the 37 homes studied, 21 homes had been painted w ith interior latex paint containing mercury a median of 86 days earlier, while the 16 control homes had not been recently painted with mercury-containing latex paints. Paint samples from the exposed homes contained a median concentration of 210 mg/L (ppm) (range, 120-610 mg/L ). The median air mercury concentration (0.3 \u00b5g/m 3) was found to be significantly higher (p<0.0001) in the exposed homes (range, not detectable to 1.5 \u00b5g/m3) than in the unexposed homes (range, not detectable to 0.3 \u00b5g/m3). Among the exposed homes, there were 7 in which paint containing <200 mg/L ha d been applied. In these homes, the median air mercury concentration was 0.2 \u00b5g/m3 (range, not detectable to 1 \u00b5g/m3). Six exposed homes had air mercury concentrations >0.5 \u00b5g/m3. The authors reported that elemental mercury was the form of mercury released to the air and that potentially hazardous me rcury exposure could occur in homes recently painted with paint containing <200 mg Hg/L (Beusterien et al. 1991). In an indoor exposure study of families of workers at a chloralkali plant in Charleston, Tennessee, mercury levels in the air of the workers' homes averaged 0.92 \u00b5g/m3 (ATSDR 1990). Ambient air concentrations of mercury have been reported to average approximately 10-20 ng/m3, with higher concentrations in industrialized areas (EPA 1980a). In 1990, metallic mercury concentrations in the gas and aerosol phases of the atmosphere in Sweden were 2-6 ng/m3 and 0.01-0.1 ng/m3, respectively (Brosset and Lord 1991). Higher levels (10-15 \u00b5g/m3) have been detected near point emission sources, such as mercury mines, refineries, and agricultural fi elds treated with mercury fungicides. AtmosphericMERCURY 411 5. POTENTIAL FOR HUMAN EXPOSURE concentrations of mercury over lakes in Wisconsin averaged 2.0 ng/m3 (Wiener et al. 1990) and ranged from 6.3 ng/m3 to 16.0 ng/m3 above the water surface of the mercury-contaminated Wabigoon River in Ontario (Schroeder and Fanaki 1988). Mean vapor concentrations of mercury in air over a forested watershed (Walker Branch Waters hed) in Tennessee were 5.5 ng/m3 in 1988-1989, while particle- associated aerosol mercury concentrati ons were determined to be 0.03 ng/m3, or approximately 0.5% of the total atmospheric mercury (Lindberg et al. 1991). Lindberg et al. (1994) measured mercury vapor at concentrations of 2-6 ng/m3 and particulate mercury at 0.002-0.06 ng/m3 at Walker Branch Watershed, Tennessee, from August 1991 to April 1992. Particulate me rcury concentrations are greater in precipitation than in ambient air. In the St. Louis River estuary , mercury levels in precipitation averaged 22 ng/L (ppt), although ambient air levels averaged 3 ng/m3 (Glass et al. 1990). Total gaseous mercury was measured (1992-1993) as pa rt of the Florida Atmospheric Mercury Study (FAMS) (Gill et al. 1995). Average total gaseous mercur y concentrations for 3- to 6-day integrated samples ranged from 1.43 to 3.11 ng/m3 (mean, 1.64 ng/m3). In the same study, Dvonch et al. (1995) reported that the mean concentrations of total gaseous mercury measured at two inland Florida sites were significantly higher (3.3 and 2.8 ng/m3) than measurements at an Atlantic coastal site (1.8 ng/m3). The mean concentrations of particle phase mercury co llected at the inland sites (51 and 49 pg/m3) were 50% higher than those at the coastal site (34 pg/m3). The mean mercury concentration in rain samples was 44 ng/L (ppt) (range, 14-130 ng/L). Guentzel et al. (1995) al so reported results of the FAMS from 1992 to 1994. These authors found that the summer time wet season in south Florida accounted for 80-90% of the annualrainfall mercury deposition. Depositiona l rates in south Florida are 30 to almost 50% higher than those in central Florida. Particle phase measurements ranged from 2 to 18 pg/m 3 at all sites. Measurement of monomethylmercury in precipitation ranged from <0.005 to 0.020 ng/L (ppt). Keeler et al. (1995) reported that particulate merc ury may contribute a significant portion of the deposition of mercury to natural waters. Mercury can be associat ed with large particles (>2.5 \u00b5m) at concentrations similar to vapor phase mercury. Particulate phase me rcury levels in rural areas of the Great Lakes and Vermont ranged from 1 to 86 pg/m3, whereas particulate mercury levels in urban and industrial areas were in the range of 15-1,200 pg/m3. Sweet and Vermette (1993) sampled airborne inhalable particulate matter in urban areas (southeast Chicago and East St. Louis) and at a rural site. Mean particulate phase mercury concentrations in particles (<2.5 \u00b5m and >2.5 \u00b5m) at the rural site were (range, <0.1-0.9 ng/m3) and 0.2 ng/m3 (range, <0.1-0.5 to 1.0 ng/m3 (range, <0.1-0.7 ng/m3) andMERCURY 412 5. POTENTIAL FOR HUMAN EXPOSURE 0.5 ng/m3 (range, <0.1-1.5 ng/m3), respectively, in Chicago and 0.7 <0.1-20 ng/m3) and 0.5 ng/m3 (range, <0.1-1.5 ng/m3), respectively, in East St. Louis. In an earlier study, Keeler et al. (1994) measured atmospheric mercury in the Great Lakes Basin. These authors reported that vapor phase mercury levels were f our times higher in Chicago, Illinois, than in South Haven, Michigan, (8.7 ng/m3 versus 2.0 ng/m3). Furthermore, a diurnal pattern was observed in the vapor phase mercury levels measured at the Chica go site. The average concentration (ng/m3) was 3.3 times greater for the daytime samples (8 AM to 2 PM) than for the night samples (8 PM to 8 AM), and the average concentration for the afternoon samples (2 PM to 8 PM) was 2.1 times greater than the night samples (average, 3.7 ng/m3). Particulate phase mercury concentrati ons were also higher at the Chicago site than at the South Haven site (98 pg/m3 versus 19 pg/m3). Burke et al. (1995) reported that the concentration of mercury in vapor phase samples measured over Lake Champlain was consistent with other rural areas (mean, 2.0 ng/m3; range, 1.2-4.2 ng/m3), and the concentrations were consistent across all seasons. Particulate phase mercury concentrations averaged 11 pg/m3, with the highest concentrations detected during the winter. A monitoring program established at a facility at Oak Ridge National Laboratories found that the major sources of mercury release to the air were vaporizati on from soil, burning of coal for a steam plant, and fugitive exhaust from a former lithium isotope separation facility contaminated with mercury (Turner et al. 1992). When the monitoring program began in 1986, am bient air mercury vapor concentrations at the facility ranged from 0.011 to 0.108 \u00b5g/m3. These values decreased to 0.006 to 0.071 \u00b5g/m3 by 1990, while background levels near the facility remained at 0.006 \u00b5g/m3. The decrease in mercury vapor concentrations occurred primarily as a result of an 80% reduction in coal burning at the steam plant;however, periods of drought and activities such as m oving contaminated soil for construction were found to increase the atmospheric mercury concentrations on a transient basis (Turner et al. 1992). Turner and Bogle (1993) monitored ambient air for mercury ar ound the same industrial complex site at Oak Ridge, Tennessee. Elemental mercury was used in large quantities at the nuclear weapons plant between 1950 and 1963 in a process similar to chloralkali production. Soil and water contamination had been found at the site. The results of weekly ambient mon itoring for gaseous mercury from 1986 through 1990 showed that gaseous mercury levels were well below the Na tional Emission Standard for Hazardous Air Pollutants (1.0 mg/m 3) with the exception of one station. Mean merc ury levels at the control site ranged from 5 to 6 \u00b5g/m3, while levels at the on-site Mean MERCURY 413 5. POTENTIAL FOR HUMAN EXPOSURE particulate mercury levels were 0.00003 \u00b5g/m3 at the control site, compared with mean concentrations at the on-site stations ranging from 0.00006 to 0.00024 \u00b5g/m3 (Turner and Bogle 1993). Mercury has been identified in air samples collected at 25 sites of the 714 NPL hazardous waste sites where it has been detected in some environmental media (HazDat 1998). 5.4.2 Water Concentrations of mercury in rainwater and fresh snow are generally below 200 ng/L (ppt) (EPA 1984b). Fitzgerald et al. (1991) measured total mercur y in rainwater from May through August 1989 at Little Rock Lake, Wisconsin. The total mercury concentra tions ranged from 3.2 to 15.2 ng/L (ppt). Mercury concentrations in precipitation collected in Mi nnesota during 1988 and 1989 averaged 18 ng/L (ppt) for an average annual mercury deposition of 15 \u00b5g/m2 (Glass et al. 1991). Antarctic surface snow contained a mean mercury concentration of less than 1 pg/g (ppt ) (Dick et al. 1990). In Ontario, Canada, mercury present in precipitation at an average concentration of 10 ng/L (ppt) accounted for more than half of the mercury inputs to surface waters compared with input s from stream runoff, suggesting that atmospheric deposition is a significant source of mercury in su rface waters (Mierle 1990). Lindberg et al. (1994) measured total mercury in rain collected at Wa lker Branch Watershed, Tennessee from August 1991 to April 1992. Rain concentrations of total merc ury ranged from 7.57 ng/L (ppt) in February 1992 to 17.4 ng/L (ppt) in April 1992. Burke et al. (1995) reported that the average concentration of mercury inprecipitation samples measured over Lake Champlain was 8.3 ng/L (ppt) for the sampling year, and theaverage amount of mercury deposited per precipitation event was 0.069 \u00b5g/m 2. The highest concentrations of mercury in precipitation samples occurred during spring and summer months. Guentzel et al. (1995) reported results of the Florida Atmospheric Monitoring Study from 1992 to 1994. Theseauthors found that the summer time wet season in south Florida accounted for 80 to 90% of the annualrainfall mercury deposition. Depositional rates in s outh Florida are 30-50% higher than those in central Florida. Measurement of monomethylmercury in precipitation samples ranged from <0.005 to 0.020 ng/L(ppt). The natural occurrence of mercury in the environmen t means that mercury is likely to occur in surface waters, even when anthropogenic sources of mercur y are absent. Freshwaters without known sources of mercury contamination generally contain less than 5 ng/L (ppt) of total mercury in aerobic surface waters (Gilmour and Henry 1991). Mercury le vels in water-borne particulates in the St. Louis River estuary ranged from 18 to 500 ng/L (ppt) (Glass et al. 1990). Wa ter samples from lakes and rivers in the Ottawa,MERCURY 414 5. POTENTIAL FOR HUMAN EXPOSURE Ontario, region of Canada had tota l mercury concentrations of 3.5-11.4 ng/L (ppt), with organic mercury constituting 22-37% of the total mercury (Schintu et al. 1989). Mercury was detected in water samples from Crab Orchard Lake, Illinois, at 70-281 ng/L (ppt) (Kohler et al. 1990). Total mercuryconcentrations in surface waters of California lak es and rivers ranged from 0.5 to 104.3 ng/L (ppt), with the dissolved particulate fraction (89%; 0.4-12 ng/L [ppt]) (Gill and Bruland 1990). The baseline concentration of mercury in unpolluted ma rine waters has been estimated to be less than 2 ng/L (2 ppt) (Fowler 1990). In contrast, the Ne w York Bight, an inshore coastal area near the industrialized areas of New York Harbor and northern New Jersey, contained dissolved mercuryconcentrations in the range of 10-90 ng/L (ppt) (Fowler 1990). Near-surface groundwaters in remote areas of Wiscons in were found to contain approximately 2-4 ng/L (ppt) of mercury, of which only a maximum of 0. 3 ng/L (ppt) was determined to be methylmercury, indicating that groundwater was not a source of me thylmercury in the lake (Krabbenhoft and Babiarz 1992). Mercury was found at levels greater than 0. 5 \u00b5g/L (ppb) in 15-30% of wells tested in some groundwater surveys (EPA 1985b). Drinking water is generally assumed to contain less than 0.025 \u00b5g/L (ppb) (EPA 1984b). A chemical monitoring study of California's public drinking water from groundwater sources was conducted by Storm (1994). This author reported that mercury was analyzed in 6,856 samples, with 225 positive detections and 27 exceedances of the maximum 0.62 ppb; range, 0.21 to 300 ppb). Mercury has been identified in surface water, gr oundwater, and leachate samples collected at 197, 395, and 58 sites, respectively, of the 714 NPL hazardous waste sites where it has been detected in some environmental media (HazDat 1998). 5.4.3 Sediment and Soil In a review of the mercury content of virgin a nd cultivated surface soils from a number of countries, it was found that the average concentrations range d from 20 to 625 ng/g (0.020 to 0.625 ppm) (Andersson 1979). The highest concentrations were generally found in soils from urban locations and in organic, versus mineral, soils. The mercury content of most soils varies with depth, with the highest mercury concentrations generally found in the surface layers. Mercury was detected at soil concentrations ranging from 0.01 to 0.55 ppm in orchard soils in New York State (Merwin et al. 1994). MERCURY 415 5. POTENTIAL FOR HUMAN EXPOSURE Granato et al. (1995) reported that municipal so lid waste sludge mercury concentrations from the Metropolitan Water Reclamation District of Greater Ch icago ranged from 1.1 to 8.5 mg/kg (ppm), with a mean concentration of 3.31 mg/kg (ppm). Sludge a pplications to a sludge utilization site in Fulton County, Illinois, from 1971 to 1995 significantly increased extractable soil mercury concentrations. Inaddition, 80-100% of the mercury applied to the soils in sewage sludge since 1971 still resided in the top 15 cm of soil. Facemire et al. (1995) reported industrial contamination of soils and sediment in several states in the southeastern United States. The authors reported soil concentrations up to 141,000 ppm associated with contamination in northeastern Louisiana from mercury- charged manometers used to measure pressure and delivery from natural gas wells. In Tennessee, a maximum mercury concentration of 1,100 ppm (associated with previous operations of the Oa k Ridge nuclear facility) was found in wetland soils adjacent to the East Fork Poplar Creek. A pharmaceu tical company's effluents enriched sediments in a localized area of Puerto Rico to 88 ppm mercury (Facemire et al. 1995). Rule and Iwashchenko (1998)reported that mean soil mercury concentrations of 1.06 ppm were collected within 2 km of a former chlor- alkali plant in Saltsville, Virginia, and that these concentrations were 17 times higher than regional background soil samples (0.063 ppm). These authors further reported that soil organic content,topographic factors, wind patterns, and elevation were variables significantly related to mercury concentration as determined by regression analysis. Soil mercury levels decreasing with distance from the former plant were indicative of a point source di stribution pattern. A made land soil type (Udorthent), which appears to be a by-product of the chlor-alk ali manufacturing process, was found proximal to the former plant site and contained about 68 times (4 .31 ppm) the regional background concentration. The top 15 cm of sediments in Wisconsin lakes contained higher levels of mercury (0.09-0.24 \u00b5g/g [ppm]) than sediments at lower sediment levels (0 .04-0.07 \u00b5g/g [ppm]). Because the lakes are not known to receive any direct deposition of mercury, it w as postulated that the primary mercury source was atmospheric deposition (Rada et al. 1989). Mercury le vels in surface sediments of the St. Louis River ranged from 18 to 500 ng/L (ppt) (Glass et al. 1990). Mercury was detected in sediment samples fromCrab Orchard Lake in Illinois at concentrations greater than 60 \u00b5g/L (ppb) (Kohler et al. 1990). Surficialsediment samples from several sites along the Upper C onnecting Channels of the Great Lakes in 1985 had mercury concentrations ranging from below the detec tion limit to 55.80 \u00b5g/g (ppm) (mean concentrations ranged from 0.05 to 1.61 \u00b5g/g [ppm] at four sites) (Nichols et al. 1991). Mercury concentrations were correlated with particle size fractions and orga nic matter content (Mudroch and Hill 1989). SurfaceMERCURY 416 5. POTENTIAL FOR HUMAN EXPOSURE sediment samples from the Lake Roosevelt/Upper Colu mbia River in Washington State were found to contain up to 2.7 \u00b5g/g (ppm) mercury (Johnson et al . 1990). Mercury concentrations in sediments up to 28 cm in depth in lakes adjacent to coal-fired pow er plants near Houston, Texas ranged from 255 to 360 mg/kg (ppm) in the summer and from 190 to 279 mg/kg (ppm) in the winter (Wilson and Mitchell1991). Surface sediments taken from Canadian lakes recei ving atmospheric input from smelters contained between 0.03 and 9.22 \u00b5g/g (ppm) mercury, with th e highest values being found in lakes nearest the smelters. However, sediment concentrations were not correlated with mercury concentrations in fish from the lakes; the fish concentrations ranged from 0.003 to 0.88 \u00b5g/g (ppm), with the highest concentration found in fish from one of the least contaminated lakes (Harrison and Klaverkamp 1990). Estuarine and coastal marine sediment samples anal yzed for NOAA's National Status and Trends Program between 1984 and 1987 showed that 38 of 175 sites contained mercury concentrations in excess of 0.41 \u00b5g/g (ppm) (dry weight) (O'Connor and Ehler 1991). In addition, mercury sediment concentrations at 6 sites exceeded the NOAA ER-M concentration of 1. 3 ppm (dry weight), which is the concentration determined to be equivalent to the median (50th pe rcentile) for all sites monitored. These 6 sites included 5 sites in the Hudson River/Raritan Estuary, New York Bight, and Raritan Bay areas between New York and New Jersey (ranging from 1.6 to 3.3 ppm dry we ight) and one site in the Oakland Estuary in California (2.3 ppm dry weight) (NOAA 1990). Sediments taken from coastal areas off British Columbia,Canada contained concentrations of mercury ranging from 0.05 \u00b5g/g to 0.20 \u00b5g/g (ppm), while mercury concentrations in fish from these waters were only slightly higher; bioconcentration factors ranged from less than 1 to 14 (Harding and Goyette 1989). Mercury has been identified in soil and sediment sam ples collected at 350 and 208 sites, respectively, of the 714 NPL hazardous waste sites where it has been detected in some environmental media (HazDat 1998). 5.4.4 Other Environmental Media Foods. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) conducted a Total Diet Study (April 1982 to April 1984) to determine dietary intakes of selected industrial chemicals (including mercury) from retail purchases of foods representative of the total diet of the U.S. population (Gunderson 1988). The data were collected as part of 8 food collections, termed \"mar ket baskets\", collected in regional metropolitan areas MERCURY 417 5. POTENTIAL FOR HUMAN EXPOSURE during the 2-year study and involved individual anal ysis of 234 food items representing the diets of 8 different population groups. Mercury was detected in 129 adult foods; seafood, the major contributing food group, accounted for 77% (3.01 \u00b5g of the 3.9 \u00b5g of mercury) of the total mercury intake for 25-30 year old males (Gunderson 1988). Minyard and Robert s (1991) reported results of a survey conducted on food samples analyzed at 10 state food laboratories between 1988 and 1989. These laboratories conductedfood regulatory programs and analyzed findings of pesticides and related chemical residues for 27,065 food samples. In 1988, these laboratories reported methylmercury residues in 13 (0.09%) of 13,980samples, with 1 sample exceeding federal or state tolerances. Similarly, in 1989, methylmercury wasdetected in 25 (0.19%) of 13,085 samples, with 1 sampl e exceeding federal or state tolerances. A survey of 220 cans of tuna, conducted in 1991 by the FDA, found an average methylmercury content (expressed as mercury) of 0.17 ppm (range, <0.10-0.75 ppm) (Yess 1993). Levels of methylmercury were higher in solid white (0.26 ppm) and chunk white tuna (0.31 ppm) than in chunk light (0.10 ppm) or chunk tuna (0.10 ppm). Previously, the FDA had determined me thylmercury concentrations in 42 samples of canned tuna between 1978 and 1990 (Yess 1993) to range from <0.01 to 0.67 ppm methylmercury (expressed as mercury), with an average concentration of 0.14 ppm. These earlier results are similar to those obtained in the 1991 survey (Yess 1993). The use of fish meal as a food for poultry and othe r animals used for human consumption may result in increased mercury levels in these animals. In Germ any, poultry and eggs were found to contain average mercury concentrations of 0.04 and 0.03 mg/kg (ppm), respectively. Cattle are able to demethylate mercury in the rumen and thus absorb less mercury; therefore, beef (meat) and cow's milk contained only 0.001-0.02 mg/kg (ppm) and 0.01 mg/kg (ppm) of mercur y, respectively (Hapke 1991). A survey of raw foods in Germany in 1986 found that grains, potatoes, vegetables, and fruits contained average mercury concentrations of 0.005 to 0.05 mg/kg (ppm fresh weight); however, wild mushrooms contained up to 8.8 mg/kg (ppm) of mercury. Cocoa beans, tea leaves, and coffee beans contained average mercury concentrations of 0.005, 0.025, and 0.04 mg/kg (ppm), respectively. In all cases where the mercurycontent was high, selenium was also found in measura ble, but lower, concentrations (Weigert 1991). Pedersen et al. (1994) conducted a monitoring study to assess the levels of trace metals, including mercury, in table wine, fortified wine, beer, soft drinks, a nd various juices. These authors reported that in all samples tested, mercury concentrations were at or below the detection limit (6 \u00b5g/L [6 ppb]).MERCURY 418 5. POTENTIAL FOR HUMAN EXPOSURE Fish and Shellfish. As part of the National Pesticide Monitoring Program (NPMP), the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service collected freshwater fish during 1976-1977 from 98 monitoring stations nationwide and analyzed them for mercury and other heavy metals (May and McKinney 1981). As part of this program, duplicate composite samples of a bottom-dwelling sp ecies and several representative predatory species were collected. Bottom-dwelling species sampled included common carp, common sucker, and channel catfish or other catfish species. Predatory species sampled were rainbow, brown, brook or lake trout atcold water stations; largemouth bass or other sunfish fa mily members, such as crappie or bluegill, at warm water stations; and walleye or othe r perch family members at cool water stations. May and McKinney (1981) reported that the mean concentration of me rcury was 0.153 ppm (wet weight basis) in the 1972 NPMP survey and that the mean concentration declined significantly to 0.112 ppm (range, 0.01-0.84 ppm)in the 1976-1977 survey. This decline was presumably due to curtailed production, use, and emissions of mercury (Lowe et al. 1985). May and McKinney (1981) identified an arbitrary 85th percentile concentration of 0.19 ppm for mercury to identify mon itoring stations having fish with higher than normal concentrations of mercury. Most of these stations were downstream of industrial sites (e.g., chloralkali operations, pulp and paper plants; or pre-1900 gold and silver mining operations), while others were located in areas with major mercury ore (cinnabar) deposits. In a follow-up NPMP study conducted from 1980-1981, Lowe et al. (1985) reported a geometric mean mercury concentration of 0.11 ppm (wet weight) (range, 0.01-1.10 ppm). These authors reported that the downward trend in mercury residues in fish reported by May and McKinney (1981) may have leveled off, since no significant difference in the geometric mean values was detected in the follow-up study conducted in 1984-1985 as part of theNational Contaminant Biomonitoring Program (Lowe et al. 1985; Schmitt and Brumbaugh 1990). However, large variations in mercury uptake am ong the fish species sampled, as well as among size classes of fish within the same species, may mask actual trends. From 1986 to 1989, the National Study of Chemical Residues in Fish (NSCRF) was conducted by the EPA to assess the concentrations of 60 toxic pollutants (including mercury) in the tissues of benthic andpredatory gamefish nationwide (EPA 1992f). Benthic species were analyzed as whole-body samples,while game fish species were analyzed as fillet sampl es, and all concentrations were reported on a wet weight basis. Mercury was detected at 92% of the 374 sites surveyed nationwide at a mean concentration of 260 ng/g (0.26 ppm) (median concentration of 0.17 ppm and a maximum concentration of 1.8 ppm), and at 2% of the sites, measured mercury concentra tions exceeded 1 ppm. Most of the higher mercury concentrations in fish were collect ed in the Northeast. Ten of the sites in the top 10th percentile for high mercury concentrations were near pulp and paper mills , four were near Superfund sites, and most of theMERCURY 419 5. POTENTIAL FOR HUMAN EXPOSURE remaining sites were near industrial areas. However, the mercury sources could not be identified at all of these sites. Five sites were considered to repr esent background conditions and six U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) National Stream Quality Accounting Network (NASQAN) sites were also among the sites in the top 10th percentile (EPA 1992f). A recent national survey conducted by the EPA solicited data on mercury concentrations in fish collected by the states as part of their fish contaminant m onitoring programs (EPA 1997b). The EPA asked all states to submit mercury residue data collected from their fish sampling programs from 1990 through 1995 to assess whether there were geographic variations or trends in fish tissue concentrations of mercury. Thirty- nine states provided information on the levels of c ontamination in their fish. The study included the following: information on the tissue concentrations of mercury, including the number of fish sampled (by species); the mean mercury concentration; and the minimum, median, and maximum concentrationsreported for each species by state. Residue inform ation for the three most abundant species sampled in each state included such species as the largemouth a nd smallmouth bass; channel, flathead, and blue rainbow and lake trout; carp; walleye; north pike; and white sucker. The highest mean mercury residue for an edible speci es was 1.4 ppm, reported by the state of Arizona; the highest maximum mercury concentrations were 7. 0 ppm for bowfin in South Carolina, followed by 6.4 ppm for white sucker in Ohio and 5.7 ppm for bow fin in North Carolina. (Note: This EPA report is currently under review by the states; however, the final report should be available by December 1998). A summary of the mean, minimum, and maximum tissue concentrations of mercury detected for two of thesampled species with the widest geographical distribu tion; the largemouth bass and the channel catfish are given in Tables 5-8 and 5-9. As Table 5-8 show s, the maximum mercury residues reported for the largemouth bass exceeded the FDA action level (1 ppm) in 15 of the 25 states that collected and analyzed tissue samples for this species. The highest maximum mercury concentration reported for this species was 4.36 ppm, reported by Florida. Table 5-9 shows the maximum mercury residue reported for another widely distributed species, the channel catfish. While the maximum mercury residues reported for this species are not consistently as high as those for the largemouth bass, maximum residues in channel catfish from 6 of the 20 reporting states still exceeded the FDA action level (1 ppm). The highest maximum valuereported for the channel catfish was 2.57 ppm, reporte d by Arkansas. Consumption of large amounts of feral fish containing these high mercury residues e xposes high-end fish consuming populations (those that consume >100 grams fish/day) to potentially greater risk of mercury exposure than members of the general population (see Sections 5.5 and 5.7). MERCURY 422 5. POTENTIAL FOR HUMAN EXPOSURE Most recently, the Northeast states and Eastern Ca nadian provinces issued their own mercury study, including a comprehensive analysis of current mercury c oncentrations in a variety of fresh water sportfish species (NESCAUM 1998). This study involved a large number of fish sampling sites in each state, manyof which were remote lake sites that did not recei ve point source discharges. Top level piscivores (i.e., predatory fish) such as walleye, chain pickerel, and large and smallmouth bass were typically found toexhibit some of the highest concentrations, with average tissue residues greater than 0.5 ppm and maximum residues exceeding 2 ppm. One largemouth bass sample was found to contain 8.94 ppm ofmercury, while one smallmouth bass sampled contained 5.0 ppm. A summary of the mean andminimum-maximum (range) of mercury concentrations in 8 species of fish sampled is shown inTable 5-10. This study also identified a relationship between elevated mercury levels in fish and certain water quality parameters, including lo w pH, high conductivity, and elevated levels of dissolved organic carbon. Lake trout taken from Lake Onta rio between 1977 and 1988 did show a progressive decline in mercury contamination from 0.24 \u00b5g/g (ppm) in 1977 to 0. 12 \u00b5g/g (ppm) in 1988 (Borgmann and Whittle 1991). Samples of zooplankton taken from an Illinois la ke in 1986 contained a pproximately 10 ng/g (ppb) mercury; however, fish that fed on the zooplankton had whole body mercury concentrations ranging from 11.6 \u00b5g/kg (ppb) for inedible shad to 69 \u00b5g/ kg (ppb) for edible largemouth bass, indicating bioaccumulation was occurring up the aquatic food chai n. Older fish generally had higher mercury concentrations (Kohler et al. 1990). Mercury concentr ations in crayfish taken from 13 Ontario lakes with no known mercury inputs ranged from 0.02 to 0.64 \u00b5g/g (ppm); the concentrations were positively correlated with organism weight and fish mercury concentrations (Allard and Stokes 1989). Brown trout taken from Lake Ontario containe d between 0.18-0.21 \u00b5g/g skinned fillets , indicating that methylmercury is associated with the protein fraction of fish tissue (Gutenmann and Lisk 1991). Methylmercury constitutes over 99% of the total mercury detected in fish muscle tissue, with no detection of inorganic or dimethylmercury (Grieb et al. 1990; Bloom 1992). Mercury levels were examined in aquatic organisms taken from the Calcasieu River/Lake Complex in Louisiana. The order of enrichment was as follows: shrimp (0.2 \u00b5g/g \u00b5g/g [ppm]) (R amelow et al. 1989). Average mercury concentrations for aquatic organisms collected from the Wabigoon/E nglish/Winnipeg River system in Canada Methylmercury concentrations were found to increase with distance from the pollutant source, MERCURY 424 5. POTENTIAL FOR HUMAN EXPOSURE possibly as a result of the increased bioavailability of organic mercury produced by aquatic micro- organisms, whereas inorganic mercury was the predominant form at the source (Parks et al. 1991). Typical mercury concentrations in large carnivorous fresh water fish (e.g., pike) and large marine fish (e.g., swordfish, shark, and tuna) have been found to ex ceed 1 \u00b5g/g (ppm) (EPA 1984b; al. 1992; Hueter et al. 1995), with me rcury content again being positively correlated with the age of the fish (Gutenmann et al. 1992; Hueter et al. 1995). Methylmercury concentrations in muscletissue of 9 species of sharks were analyzed from 4 lo cations off Florida (Hueter et al. 1995). Muscle tissue methylmercury concentration averaged 0.88 \u00b5g/g ( ppm) (wet weight) from 0.06 to 2.87 \u00b5g/g (ppm), with 33.1% of the samples exceeding the FDA action level (1 ppm). A positive correlationbetween methylmercury and shark body length (size) al so was found, such that sharks larger than 200 cm in total length contained methylmercury concentrations >1 ppm. Sharks collected off the southern and southwestern coastal areas contained significantly highe r concentrations than those caught in the northeast coastal region (Cape Canaveral and north). Methylmercury concentrations were highest in the Caribbean reef shark ( Carcharhinus perezi ). The two most abundant shark species in the U.S. E ast Coast commercial shark fishery, sandbar (C. plumbeus ) and blacktip ( C. limbatus ) sharks, are of special concern with respect to human health. Although the mean concentration of methylmercury in the sandbar shark (0.77 \u00b5g/g) was below the average for all sharks, sandbar shark tissues contained up to 2.87 ppm methylmercury, and 20.9% of the samples exceeded theFDA action level of 1 ppm. A total of 71.4% of th e blacktip shark samples (mean , 1.3 \u00b5g/g) exceeded the FDA action level. The authors suggest that conti nued monitoring of methylmercury concentrations in various sharks species in the commercial marketplace is warranted. In a recent study of sportfish collected in San Francisco Bay, Fairey et al. (1997) reporte d that the highest concentrations of mercury were detected in leopard shark muscle tissue (1.26 ppm). Bluefin tuna caught in the Northwest Atlantic Ocean in 1990 contained mercury at a mean muscle concentra tion of 3.41 \u00b5g/g (ppm) dry weight (Hellou et al. 1992). As part of the National Oceanic and Atmospheri c Administration (NOAA) Status and Trends Program conducted from 1984 to 1987, mercury concentrations we re analyzed in four marine bivalve species in U.S. coastal waters (NOAA 1987). Mercury concen trations in bivalve tissues ranged from 0.01 to dry Mytilus edulis ), and 0.04 to MERCURY 425 5. POTENTIAL FOR HUMAN EXPOSURE 0.26 \u00b5g/g (ppm) in around the Gulf of Mexico between 1986 and 1989 had mercury con centrations ranging from [ppm]) (Presley et al. 1990). Oysters taken from the Mississippi Sound in 1986 generally did not contain mercury at levels exceeding the detection limit (0.02 \u00b5g/g [ppm]), although two samples had detectable mercury levels of 0.66 and 6.6 \u00b5g/g [ppm] (Lytle and Lytle 1990). Mercury has been detected in fi sh samples collected at 56 of the 714 NPL hazardous waste sites where it has been detected in some environmental media (HazDat 1998). Marine mammals. Mercury concentrations have been analy zed in various tissues (i.e., muscle, liver, kidneys) from several species of marine mammals, including beluga whales, narwhal, white-toothed dolphins, pilot whales, ringed seals, harp seals, and walruses in the western and eastern Canadian Arctic (Wagemann et al. 1995). The mean mercury concentration (\u00b5g/g [ppm] dry weight) in liver tissue was highest in pilot whales (78 ppm), harp seals (36 ppm), Eastern Arctic ringed seals (29 ppm), narwhal(25 ppm), and Eastern Arctic beluga (22 ppm), with lesser amounts in Arctic walrus (5 ppm) and dolphins (4 ppm). Of the three tissues analyzed, mercury w as most concentrated in the liver, with successively lower concentrations in the kidney and muscle tissue. This pattern prevails in most marine mammals. The concentration of total mercury is greater by a fact or of 3 in the liver than in the kidney, but can be significantly higher in some species (see Table 5-11) . Mean tissue residues in ringed seals from the western Arctic had significantly higher concentrations of mercury than those from the eastern Arctic. The authors reported higher mercury levels in sed iment (68-243 ng/g [ppb] dry weight) and water (11-29 ng/L [ppt]) from the western Arctic, as compared to (40-60 ng/g [ppb] dry weight) andwater (3.7 ng/L [ppb]) from the eastern Arctic. Th ese differences in sediment and water mercury levels may be responsible for some of the observed differe nces in mercury tissue concentrations in the seals. Mercury tissue concentrations were detected in 17 adult and 8 fetal pilot whales from two stranding episodes off Cape Cod, Massachusetts (Meador et al. 1993). Total mercury occurred in high concentrations in both the liver and kidney, and liver concentrations were significantly correlated with the animal's length. Methylmercury, as a percentage of total mercury, va ried inversely with total mercury, indicating that demethylation was occurring. Mean adult mercury con centrations in \u00b5g/g (ppm) dry weight in liver and kidneys were 176 ppm (range, 1.9-626 ppm dry weight ) and 27.5 ppm (range, 6.8-49.7 ppm dry weight), respectively. Mean fetal mercury concentrations in \u00b5g/g (ppm) dry weight in liver and kidneys MERCURY 427 5. POTENTIAL FOR HUMAN EXPOSURE were 2.3 ppm (range, 0.9-5.4 ppm dry weight) and 1.9 ppm (range, 0.6-3.9 ppm dry weight), respectively. The mean methylmercury concentration in \u00b5g/g (ppm) dry weight in adult liver tissue was 8 ppm (range, 5.6-10 ppm). Aguilar and Borrell (1995) studied mercury tissue levels (1970 to 1988) in harbor porpoises in the eastern North Atlantic. These authors reported that in most tissues of harborporpoises, the mercury was virtually all in the form of methylmercury; however, the fraction of organicmercury in the liver was much lower than in the r est of the body tissues. These authors found that for a given tissue, the concentrations detected were extr emely variable between localities and years. Mercury concentrations in harbor porpoises ranged from 0. 62 to 70 ppm in liver and from 0.66 to 22 ppm in muscle. The mean mercury concentration in liver for the eastern harbor porpoise population was11.2 ppm. Mercury tissue levels progressively increased with the age of the animal; no significantdifferences were found between the sexes (Aguilar and Borrell 1995). Plants. Although data on mercury distribution among fr eshwater vascular plant parts is lacking for unpolluted systems, Mortimer (1985) reported that total mercury in the roots of five species of freshwater vascular plants in the polluted Otta wa River was 10-40% higher than in the shoots. Speciation may be important in determining the pattern s of mercury uptake, translocation, and excretion in macrophytes. Shoots of Elodea densa more readily accumulated methylmercury than inorganic mercury, and also excreted more inorganic merc ury than methylmercury (Czuba and Mortimer 1980). Significant translocation of inorganic mercury from shoots to roots occurred in E. densa (Czuba and Mortimer 1980). In this species, methyl- and i norganic mercury moved in opposite directions, with methylmercury moving towards the young shoot apex , and inorganic mercury moving towards lower (older) parts of the shoot (Czuba and Mortimer 1980). Dolar et al. (1971) noted the samemethylmercury pattern in the water milfoil ( Myriophyllum spicatum ). Using solution culture experiments, these authors showed that mercury accu mulation was greater when plants were exposed to inorganic mercury (HgCl 2) than organic methylmercury (CH3HgCl) and that mercury accumulation from the nutrient solution was rapid and approached maximum values in 2 Organomercurycompounds (methylmercury chloride, 2 and HgCl2) from lake sediments. The various organomercury and inorga nic mercury compounds were added to sediment at concentrations of 0, 46, 230, and 460 ppm prior to r ooting water milfoil. After 20 days, concentration of mercury in the plant tissues exposure to 46, 230, and 460 ppm of the inorganic mercury compounds in the sediment ranged from 1.71 to 4.01, 4.81-6.03, and 6.61-10.2, respectively. In contrast, theconcentrations of mercury in plant tissues exposed to 46, 230, and 460 ppm of the organic mercury compounds in the sediment ranged from 2.40 to 7.15 ppm, 36-84.5 ppm, and 114.6-243.1 ppm, MERCURY 428 5. POTENTIAL FOR HUMAN EXPOSURE respectively. The control plants (no mercury compounds added to the sediments) contained 0.3 ppm mercury. It is clear from this experiment that organomercury compounds may accumulate significantlyin the above-ground parts of some macrophytes. Mortimer (1985) found that although E. densa shoots had lower total mercury contents than roots, with 32% of the mercury in the shoots in the form of methylmercury, compared to only 10% in the roots. Grasses sampled downwind of a municipal waste incinerator contained up to 0.20 \u00b5g/g (ppm) of mercury, with concentrations decreasing with in creasing distance from the facility (Bache et al. 1991). Background mercury levels in vege tation were usually below 0.1 \u00b5g/g (ppm) dry weight (Lindqvist 1991e); however, mushrooms collected 1 km from a l ead smelter in Czechoslovakia contained between 0.3 and 12 mg/kg (ppm) dry weight (Kalac et al. 1991). Consumer and Medicinal Products. Various consumer and medici nal products contain mercury or mercury compounds (i.e., skin lightening creams and soaps, herbal remedies, laxatives, tattooing dyes, fingerpaints, artists paints, and make-up pa al. 1987; Rastogi 1992; Wendroff 1990). Barr et al. (1973) reported elevated mercury levels in the blood of women using skin lightening creams, although the mercury compound and concentrations in the skin cream were not determined. More recently, Dyall-Smith and Scurry (1990) reported that one skin lightening cosmetic cream contained 17.5% mercuric ammonium chloride. Lauwerys et al. (1987) reporte d a case of mercury poisoning in a 3-month-old infant whose mother frequently used a skin lightening cream and soap containing inorganic mercury during her pregnancy and during the 1-month l actation period following birth. However, the mercury concentration and specific mercury compound in the cream and soap were not determined. Al-Saleh and Al-Doush (1997) analyzed the inorganic mercury content of 38 skin lightening creams in Saudi Arabian markets. Thecreams were manufactured in a variety countries, including India and Pakistan, other Arab countries,Thailand, Taiwan, Indonesia, England and Germany. Almost 50% of the creams tested exceeded the tolerance limit of 1 ppm. The mean concentration of mercury in the 38 creams was 994 ppm, with a rangeof 0-5,650 ppm. It is not known whether any of th ese products are available in the United States. Metallic mercury was also the source of two cases of mercury poisoning caused by the dermal application of an over-the-counter anti-lice product (Bourgeois et al. 1986). The more severely poisoned individual applied 30 g of ointment containing 9 g of metallic mercury (300,000 ppm) to his entire body. Wands et al. MERCURY 429 5. POTENTIAL FOR HUMAN EXPOSURE (1974) also reported the deaths of two individuals due to the excessive use of a laxative preparation containing mercurous chloride (calomel). Metallic mercury has been used by Mexican Ameri can and Asian populations in traditional remedies for chronic stomach disorders (Espinoza et al. 1995; 1996; Geffner and Sandler 1980; Trotter 1985). Mostrecently, Perharic et al. (1994) reported cases of pois onings resulting from exposure to traditional remedies and food supplements reported to the National Po isons Unit in London, England. From 1989 to 1991, elemental mercury was implicated in several poisoni ngs following exposure to traditional Asian medicines. In one case, the mercury concentration in the medi cinal product taken orally was 540 mg/g (540,000 ppm). The mercury was in its elemental or metallic form . Espinoza et al. (1995, 1996) reported that while examining imported Chinese herbal balls for the presen ce of products from endangered species, the authors detected potentially toxic levels of arsenic and mercury in certain herbal ball preparations. Herbal balls are aromatic, malleable, earth-toned, roughly spherical, ha nd-rolled mixtures primarily composed of herbs and honey that are used to make medicinal teas. These herbal balls are used as a self-medication for a wide variety of conditions, including fever, rheumatism, apopl exy, and cataracts. Herbal balls similar to those analyzed are readily available in specialty mark ets throughout the United States. Mercury (probably mercury sulfide) was detected in 8 of the 9 herbal balls tested. The recommended adult dose for the herbal balls is two per day. Ingesting two herbal balls could theoretically provide a dose of up to 1,200 mg of mercury. Samudralwar and Garg (1996) conducted trace metal analys is on a variety of plants used in Indian herbal remedies and other medicinal preparations. These aut hors reported mercury concen trations of 139, 180, 27, 12.5, 11.7, and <10 for Bowen's and orange peel, respectively. Hoet and Lison (1997) reported on an unusual non-occupational source of mercury exposure that resulted in a woman that used prescription nasal drops that contained 300 mg/L (ppm) borate phenylmercury. Theseauthors reported that the woman, who had used the n asal drops over a long period of time, had high urinary levels of mercury (82 \u00b5g/g), but that bl ood levels were not abnormal (5.5 \u00b5g/L). Mercuric sulfide, or cinnabar, was reported to be used in tattooing dyes to produce a red pigmentation (Bagley et al. 1987; Biro and Klein 1967). An analysis of finger paints and make-up paints manufactured in Europe showed that they all contained less than 1 ppm mercury (Rastogi 1992). Rastogi and Pritzi (1996)MERCURY 430 5. POTENTIAL FOR HUMAN EXPOSURE conducted another study to assess the migration of several toxic metals from crayons, watercolor paints, and water-based paints. Migration of mercury from the art materials was determined by scraping flakes of the products into dichloromethane for 2 hours at 54 E C. The degreased material was then placed in an aqueous HCl solution, shaken, and centrifuged. The supernat ant was then filtered through a 0.45 \u00b5 membrane filter and was analyzed. These authors reported that th e migration of mercury from these art supplies was 0.24-5.98 ppm for red, 0.26-3.63 ppm for 0.22-5.68 ppm for green, and0.17-3.63 ppm for white paint. Migration of mercury from the product occurred in 57% of the samplestested. The migration limit set by European Standa rd EN71-3 for mercury is 60 ppm. This value was not exceeded in any of the art supplies tested. The authors, however, believe that children might be exposed not only to mercury, but to several other metals that also co-migrated from the paints. Cigarettes. In a study conducted in West Germany, Pesch et al. (1992) analyzed mercury concentrations in 50 brands of cigarettes manufactured in 2 Western and 6 Eastern European countries. These authors reported that in 1987, the average mercury concentra tion detected in cigarettes was 0.098 \u00b5g/g (ppm) (dry weight) (range, 0.06 to 0.14 ppm dry weight). In 1991, the mean mercury concentrations for cigarettes were 0.034 \u00b5g/g (ppm) dry weight (range, 0.007-0.092 ppm dry weight) for Eastern Europe and 0.015 \u00b5g/g (ppm) dry weight (range, 0.006-0.037 ppm dry weight) for Western European countries. The authorsattributed the decline in mercury content of cigarett es to environmental protection measures instituted in the intervening years (Pesch et al. 1992). Religious and Ethnic Rituals, Ceremonies, and Practices. While some of medicinal and pharmaceutical uses of mercury compounds have been repl aced in recent years, individuals in some ethnic or religious groups may still use mercury in various religious or ethnic rituals, practices, and ceremonies that can expose them to elevated mercury concentrati ons in room air. Metallic mercury has been used in Latin American and Caribbean communities as part of certain religious practices (e.g., Voodoo, Santeria, and Espiritismo), predominantly in domestic se ttings (Wendroff 1990). This use of mercury can contaminate a dwelling or automobile if the mercur y is not completely removed from flooring, carpeting, and woodwork in an appropriate manner. Metallic mercury (sometimes under the name azogue) currently is sold in shops called botanicas which stock medicinal plants, traditional medicines, incense, candles, and perfumes. Botanicas typically dispense mercury in gelatin capsules or sometimes in small glass vials. Some religious practices involve sprinkling metallic merc ury on the floor of the dwelling or of a car, mixing metallic mercury with soap and water to wash the floor , or placing it in an open container to rid the house of evil spirits. Other practices involve carrying a small am ount of mercury in a vial on the person, or mixingMERCURY 431 5. POTENTIAL FOR HUMAN EXPOSURE mercury in bath water or perfumed soaps, devotiona l candles, ammonia or camphor. Any of these practices can liberate mercury vapor into the room air, exposing the occupants to elevated levels of mercury vapors (ATSDR 1997; Wendroff 1990, 1991). In addition to the indi viduals that intentionally use mercury in their dwellings, the opportunity exists for nonusers to be ina dvertently exposed when they visit the dwelling, or purchase or rent dwellings in which the former tenant s used mercury for religious purposes. The issuance of cautionary notices and information by health departments to members of these user populations isappropriate. 5.5 GENERAL POPULATION AND OCCUPATIONAL EXPOSURE Potential sources of general populati on exposure to mercury include inha lation of elemental mercury vapors in ambient air, ingestion of drinking water and foods tuffs contaminated with elemental mercury or various mercury compounds (i.e., methylmercury), and expos ures to elemental mercury and various mercury compounds through dental and medical treatments (N IOSH 1973). EPA (1984b) reported that dietary intake is the most important source of nonoccupationa l human exposure to mercury, with fish and fish products being the dominant sources of methylmercury in th e diet. This is consistent with an international study of heavy metals detected in foodstuffs from 12 different countries (Toro et al. 1994). These authors found that mercury concentrations of 0.15 mg/kg (ppm) for fish and shellfish were approximately 10-100 times greater than for the other foods tested, including cereals, potatoes, vegetables, fruits, meat,poultry, eggs, milk, and milk products . Another author also estimated mean mercury concentrations to be 100 times greater for fish than for foods other than fish ((0.4 \u00b5g/g vs. 0.004 \u00b5g/g [ppm]) (Fishbein 1991). Recent animal and human studies, however, have also shown that the uptake, distribution, and rate of excretion of elemental mercury from dental amalgams are also major contributing factors to mercury bodyburden in humans (Bj\u00f6rkman et al. 1997; Lorscheider et al. 1995). A summary of contributing sources of mercury to th e body burden of humans is presented in Table 5-12. Because of the variability in fish consumption hab its among U.S. consumers and the variability in the concentrations of methylmercury detected in various fish and shellfish species, exposures for individual members of the general population are difficult to measu re. Similarly, because of the variability in the number of amalgam fillings in individual members of the general population and th e high retention rate for elemental mercury, a wide range of potential exposures to elemental mercury can be shown for persons with dental amalgams. Dental amalgams, however, may represent the largest single non-occupationalcontributing source to total body burden of some mercur y in people with large numbers of amalgam fillings.MERCURY 433 5. POTENTIAL FOR HUMAN EXPOSURE Dietary Sources of Mercury. Galal-Gorchev (1993) analyzed dietary intakes of mercury from 14 countries, including the United States, between 1980 and 1988. This author reported that the contribution of fish to the total intake of mercury varied from a low of 20% in Belgium and the Netherlands to 35% in France, the United Kingdom, and the United States. The highest contribution of fish to mercuryintake (85%) was reported for Finland. The author further pointed out (based on information from the Netherlands on levels of mercury contamination in a variety of foods) that although mercury was found at higher concentrations in fish (0.1 mg/kg [ppm]) than in other foods (0.01 mg/kg or less), higher consumption of cereals and meats render the contributi ons of these food groups to the total mercury intake about the same as that from fish. Therefore, the genera l assumption that fish is the main contributor to the intake of mercury may, at times, not be justified because of dietary habits of a given population (Galal- Gorchev 1993). The FDA's Total Diet Study (April 1982-April 1984) estimated an average daily intake of mercury (total) based on measured levels and assumed trace amounts in foods to be representative of the \"total diet\" of the U.S. population (Gunderson 1988). Estimated daily expos ures for mercury were 0.49 \u00b5g/day for infants ages 6-11 months, 1.3 \u00b5g/d for 2-year-old children, 2. 9 \u00b5g/day for females ages 25-30, and 3.9 \u00b5g/day for males 25-30 years of age. Expressed on a per body weight basis, the intake for all age groups, except2-year-old children, was approximately 50 ng/kg/ day (Clarkson 1990; Gunders on 1988). For 2-year-old children, the intake was estimated to be approximate ly 100 ng/kg/day (assuming 50% of the fish intake was due to fish caught locally). More recently, MacIntosh et al. (1996) calculated average daily dietaryexposure to mercury and 10 other contaminants for approximately 120,000 U.S. adults by combining data on annual diet, as measured by a food frequency questionna ire, with contaminant residue data for table- ready foods that were collected as part of the annual FDA Total Diet Study (1986-1991). The estimatedmean dietary exposure (\u00b5g/day) for 78,882 adult fe males and 38,075 adult males in 1990 was 8.2 \u00b5g/day (range, 0.37-203.5 \u00b5g/day) for females and 8.6 \u00b5g/day (range, 0.22-165.7 \u00b5g/day) for males. Assuming abody weight of 65 kg for women and 70 kg for men, th e daily intakes of mercury would be 126 ng/kg/day (range, 5.7-3,131 ng/kg/day) for women and 123 ng/kg/day (range, 3.1-2,367 ng/kg/day) for men respectively. These authors found that the coefficient of variation was 44% for mercury, indicating that the exposures to this chemical estimated for a given i ndividual may be accurate to within approximately a factor of 2. Lack of data about the actual am ount of food consumed accounted for 95% of the total uncertainty for mercury. Individual food items c ontributing most to the uncertainty of mercury measurements were canned tuna and other fish (MacIntosh et al. 1996).MERCURY 434 5. POTENTIAL FOR HUMAN EXPOSURE The FDA currently has advice for consumers posted on th e Internet that recommends that pregnant women and women of childbearing age, who may become pre gnant, limit their consumption of shark and swordfish to no more that one meal per month (FDA 1998). This advice is given because methylmercury levels are much higher in these fish species than in the mo re commonly consumed species. Dietary practices immediately before pregnancy could also have a di rect bearing on fetal exposure, particularly during pregnancy. The FDA states that nursing mothers who follow this advice, do not expose their infants to increased health risks from methylmercury (FDA 1998). The FDA further advises that persons other than pregnant women and women of child-bearing age limit their regular consumption of shark and swordfish (which typically contain methylmercury at approxi mately 1 ppm) to about 7 ounces per week (about one serving) to stay below the recommended maximum daily intake for methylmercury. For fish species with methylmercury levels averaging 0.5 ppm, regular consumption should be limited to 14 ounces (about 2 servings) per week. A summary of mercury concentra tions in the top 10 types of fish consumed by the general U.S. population is presented in Table 5-13. Th ere is a wide degree of variability in the amount of fish consumed in the diet by various subpopulations within the United States. Various ethnic groups, as well as recreational and subsistence fishers often eat la rger amounts of fish than the general population and may routinely fish the same waterbodies (EPA 1995k). If these waterbodies are contaminated, thesepopulations may consume a larger dose of mercury by vi rtue of the fact that they consume larger amounts of fish (from >30 g/day for recreational fishers to >100 g/day for subsistence fishers) with higher concentrations of mercury in their tissues than indi viduals in the general popula tion that tend to consume smaller amounts (6.5 g/day) of supermarket-purchased fish that come from a variety of sources. Table 5-14provides a summary of the amount of fish consumed daily by the general population, as compared torecreational and subsistence fishers, including some Na tive American tribal groups. Those individuals that consume greater than 100 g of fish per day are cons idered high-end consumers; they consume more than 10 times the amount of fish estimated to be consumed by members of the general population (6.5 g/day) (EPA 1995k). Table 5-15 provides an summary of the estimated tota l number of persons in th e U.S. population (excluding Alaska and Hawaii), the total female population of reproductive age (ages 15-44 years), and the total population of children (<15 years). Based on the percen tage of people that reported eating fish during a 3-day dietary survey conducted from 1989 to 1991 as part of the Continuing Survey of Food Intake by Individuals (CSFII), the number of persons estimated to consume fish can be calculated. Using this method, more than 76 million people in the U.S. population eat fish; of these, more than 17 million females of reproductive age (15-44 years old) consume fish, a nd more than 13 million children (<15 years of age) eat MERCURY 439 5. POTENTIAL FOR HUMAN EXPOSURE fish. In addition, estimates of the total number of pe rsons in the high-end fish consumer group (subsistence fishers) have been calculated, as were estimates of the total number of adult women of reproductive age (15 to 44 years old) and children (<15 years old) in the high-end consumer group, i.e., those potentially at greatest risk of exposure (EPA 1996e). With respect to fish consumers, more than 3.8 million are high-endconsumers (>100 grams of fish/day), and of these, it is estimated that more than 887,000 are women ofreproductive age (15-44 years), and 665,000 are children (<15 years old). It was also estimated that of thefish consuming females of reproductive age, more than 84,000 are pregnant in any given year. Fish is generally considered an excellent source of protein in the diet and the health benefit of fish consumption, including the reduction in the incidence of coronary heart disease, is well recognized(Salonen et al. 1995). However, Salonen et al. (1995) studied 1,833 eastern Finnish men ages 42-60 andrelated high dietary intake of freshwater fish contai ning mercury residues, as well as elevated hair content and urinary excretion of mercury, to a risk of acute myocardial infarction and death from coronary heart disease and cardiovascular disease. Men with the highest te rtile of hair mercury had a 2-fold age-specific risk and a 2.9-fold adjusted risk of acute myocardi al infarction and cardiovascular death, compared to men with lower mercury hair levels. Egeland and Middaugh (1997) and Clarks on et al. (1998) contend that the Seychelles population is a more appropriate sentinel population for fish consumers in the United States because: (1) the major source of methylmercury is fro m open ocean fish; (2) the mercury concentrations in hair are 10-20 times the average found in the United St ates; and (3) because the Seychellois consistently consume about 12 fish meals per week. These authors feels that the potential adverse effects ofmethylmercury in fish would be detected in the Se ychelles Island population, long before such effects are observed in the United States. The Finnish study (Salonen et al. 1995), however, suggests that freshwaterfish, low in selenium and omega-3 polyunsaturated fa tty acids, may not protect against cardiovascular risks from methylmercury. The human health benefit/cos t tradeoff between fish consumption and mercury exposure varies by species and mercury dose. Dental Amalgams. Recent animal and human studies have also identified the uptake, distribution, and rate of excretion of elemental mercury from dental amalgams as another significant contributing source to mercury body burden in humans (Bj\u00f6rkman et al. 1997; Lorscheider et al. 1995). A summary ofcontributing sources of mercury to the human body burde n is presented in Table 5-12. Because of the wide range of potential exposures and the hi gh retention rate for elemental mercury, dental amalgams potentially represent the largest single contributing source of merc ury exposure in some individuals with large numbers (>8) of amalgam fillings.MERCURY 440 5. POTENTIAL FOR HUMAN EXPOSURE Dental amalgams may contain 43-54% elemental mercury (DHHS 1993). A single amalgam filling with an average surface area of 0.4 cm2 has been estimated to release as much as 15 \u00b5g mercury/day, primarily through mechanical wear and evaporation, but also through dissolution into saliva (Lorscheider et al. 1995). The rate of release is influenced by chewing, bruxism (grinding of teeth) food c onsumption, tooth brushing, and the intake of hot beverages (W einer and Nylander 1995). For the average individual with eight occlusal amalgam fillings, 120 \u00b5g of mercury could be rel eased daily into the mouth, and a portion of that swallowed or inhaled (Lorscheider et al. 1995). Expe rimental results regarding estimated daily dose of inhaled mercury vapor released from dental amalgam restorations are few and contradictory (Berglund 1990). More recently, Bj\u00f6rkman et al. (1997) reporte d that approximately 80% of inhaled mercury from dental amalgams is absorbed (Bj\u00f6rkman et al. 1997). Various laboratories have estimated the average daily absorption of amalgam mercury ranging from 1 to 27 \u00b5g, with levels for some individuals being as high as 100 \u00b5g/day (Bj\u00f6rkman et al. 1997; Lorscheider et al. 1995; Weiner and Nylander 1995). Estimates of meandaily elemental mercury uptake from dental amal gams from these and earlier studies are summarized in Table 5-16. A report from the Committee to Coordi nate Environmental Hea lth and Related Programs (CCEHRP) of the Department of Health and Human Services determined that \"measurement of mercury in blood among subjects with and without amalgam restora tions . . . were removed . . . provide the best estimates of da ily intake from amalgam dental restorations. These values are in the range of 1-5 \u00b5g/day\" (DHHS 1993). Another source indicates that the consensus average estimate is 10 \u00b5g amalgam Hg/day (range, 3-17 \u00b5g/day) (WHO 1991). However, Halbach (1994)examined the data from 14 independent studies a nd concluded that the probable mercury dose from amalgam is less than 10 \u00b5g/day. Most recently, Richardson (1995) computed a release rate per filled toothsurface as 0.73 \u00b5g/day-surface, with a standard de viation of 0.3 \u00b5g/day-surface and a \"stimulation magnification factor\" of 5.3, based on a weighted av erage enhancement of mercury vapor concentration following chewing, eating, or tooth brushing reported in three amalgam studies. By comparison to the estimated daily absorbance of mercury from dental amalgams (range, 3-17 \u00b5g), the estimated daily absorbance from all forms of merc ury from fish and seafood is 2.31 \u00b5g and from other foods, air, and water is 0.3 \u00b5g (WHO 1991). These ot her sources taken together only total 2.61 \u00b5g/day, in comparison to estimates of 3-17 \u00b5g/day for dental amalgams. Assuming a person has large numbers of amalgams, this source may account for 17 \u00b5g/day out of a total absorbance of 19.61 \u00b5g/day, or 87% of theabsorbed mercury. In contrast, in individuals w ith only a few amalgams, mercury from this source may account for only 3 \u00b5g mercury/day out of a total absorbance of 5.61 \u00b5g/day, or 53% of absorbed mercury. Halbach et al. (1994) concluded that the sum of the mercury uptake from dental amalgam and dietary MERCURY 442 5. POTENTIAL FOR HUMAN EXPOSURE uptake is still below the dose corresponding to the accepta ble daily intake (ADI) of mercury. The ADI of 40 \u00b5g total mercury, 30 \u00b5g of which are allowed for me thylmercury, results in a total dose of approximately 30 \u00b5g after accounting for absorption (Halbach 1994; WHO 1976). WHO (1990) estimates a dailyabsorption of 2.61 \u00b5g from background exposur e for persons without amalgam exposure. In a recent study by Schweinsberg (1994), the author monitored mercury in blood, urine, and hair of subjects with amalgam fillings, in subjects who consum ed fish, and in mercury-exposed workers. With respect to hair concentrations, the author reporte d a mean mercury level in hair of 560 \u00b5g/kg (ppb), 940 \u00b5g/kg, and 1,600 \u00b5g/kg in subjects that consumed the following mean amounts of fish per month:120 g/month (range, 0-<400 g fish/month); whole blood 0.2-0.4 \u00b5g/L for individuals with no fish consump tion and no dental amalgams, 1.047\u00b10.797 \u00b5g/L for persons no fish consumption and >6 dental amalgams, 2.56\u00b12.123 \u00b5g/L for persons with fish dental amalgams, and g/month and >6 dental amalgams. Mercury concentrations in th e urine of occupationally exposed thermometer factory workers were higher, by a factor of 100, than in the group with amalgam fillings. The author concluded that both amalgam fillings and the consumption of fi sh burden individuals with mercury in approximately the same order of magnitude. In a more recent study of lactating women, Oskarsson et al. (1996) assessed the total and inorganic mercury content in breast milk and blood in relation to fish consumption and amalgam fillings. The total mercury concentrations (mean\u00b1standard deviation) in breast milk, blood, and hair samples collected 6 weeks after delivery from 30 Swedish women were 0.6\u00b10.4 ng/g (ppb) , 2.3\u00b11.0 ng/g, milk, an average of 51% of total mercury was in the inorganic form, whereas in blood an average of only 26% was in the inorganic form. Total and inorganic mercury levels in blood and milk were correlated with the number of amalgam fillings. The concentrations of total mercury and organic mercury in blood and total mercury in hair were correlated with the estimated recent exposure to methylmercury via consumption of fish. There was no significant difference between the m ilk levels of mercury in any form and the estimated methylmercury intake. A significant correlation was f ound, however, between the levels of total mercury in blood and in milk, with milk levels being an aver age of 27% of the blood levels. There was also an association between inorganic mercury in blood and in m ilk; the average level of inorganic mercury in milk was 55% of the level of inorganic mercury in blood. No significant correlations were found between the levels of any form of mercury in milk and the levels of organic mercury in blood. The results indicated that MERCURY 443 5. POTENTIAL FOR HUMAN EXPOSURE there was an efficient transfer of inorganic mercury from blood to milk and that, in the study population, mercury from amalgam fillings was the main source of mercury in breast milk. Exposure of the infant tomercury in breast milk was calculated to range up to 0.3 \u00b5g/kg/day, of which a pproximately one half was inorganic mercury. This exposure co rresponds to approximately one-half th e tolerable daily intake for adults recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) . The authors concluded that efforts should be made to decrease mercury burden in women of reproductive age. Blood. (EPA 1996d). Because methylmercury freely distributes throughout the body, blood is a good indicator medium for estimating methylmercury exposur e. However, because an individual's intake may fluctuate, blood levels may not reflect mercury intake over time (Sherlock and Quinn 1988; Sherlock et al. 1982). Recent reference values for total mercury levels in blood of non-exposed individuals in the general U.S. population are very limited. The mean concentr ation of mercury in whole blood based on a review of existing data from other countries, is 8 \u00b5g/L (ppb) (WHO 1990). Certain groups with high fish consumption may attain blood methylmercury levels of 200 \u00b5g/L ( ppb), which is associated with a low (5%) risk of neurological damage to adults (WHO 1990). Urine. Urine is a common indicator used to assess occupational mercury exposure (EPA 1996d). Urinary mercury is thought to indicate most closely the mercur y levels present in the kidneys (Clarkson et al. 1988b). But while urinary mercury has been widely used to estimate occupational exposures, reference values for urinary mercury levels in non-exposed individuals in the general U.S. population are very limited. The mean concentration of urinary mercury, based on a review of existing data from other countries, is about 4 \u00b5g/L (ppb) (WHO 1990, 1991). For assessment of long-term inorganic mercury exposure, biological monitoringof the urinary mercury is normally used (Skare 1995). Several authors have related elevated urinary mercury levels to dental amalgams in individuals in the ge neral population (Barregard et al. 1995; Skare 1995) and in dentists and dental personnel r eceiving occupational exposures (Akesson et al. 1991; Chien et al. 1996; WHO 1991). Breast Milk. Recent reference values for mercury levels in breast milk in non-exposed individuals in the general U.S. population are very limited. The mean concentration of mercury in breast milk, based on a review of existing data from other countries, is 8 \u00b5g/L (ppb) (WHO 1990, 1991). Mean concentrations of mercury in breast milk samples from the United States and other countries are summarized in Table 5-17. Pitkin et al. (1976) reported a mean total merc ury concentration of 0.93\u00b10.23 ppb in a midwestern community in the United States. This mean value is only about one-third the mean value reported for Inuit MERCURY 445 5. POTENTIAL FOR HUMAN EXPOSURE women living in interior (3.2\u00b10.8 ppb) or urban areas (3.3\u00b10.5 ppb) of Alaska and less than one-seventh the mean value for coastal Alaskan I nuit women (7.6\u00b12.7 ppb) known to consume seal meat and oil, as well as marine fish (Galster 1976). The latter breast milk tota l mercury level is comparable to the median (2.45 ppb) and maximum (8.7 ppb) values reported for women in th e Faroe Islands that consume large amounts of fish and pilot whale meat (Grandjean et al. 1995a). Levels of total mercury in breast milk have been m onitored in several foreign countries over the past three decades. A mean breast milk mercury concentration of 3.6\u00b12.2 ppb (range, non-detected to 9.8 ppb) was reported for an urban population in Tokyo, Japan (Fujita and Takabatake 1977). In a study of urban women residing in Madrid, Spain, the mean breast milk mercury concentration w as 9.5\u00b15.5 ppb (range, 0.9-19 ppb) (Baluja et al. 1982). These authors did not provide any information (i.e., whether females were fishconsumers, the number of dental amalgams they had, or their occupations) that would explain the relatively high mercury levels. Skerfving ( 1988) reported mercury concentrations ranged from 0.2 to 6.3 ppb in breast milk of Swedish women that consumed fish; however, th is author did not provide specific information on the fish consumption rate or the number of dental amalga ms of the study population. Most recently, Oskarsson et al. (1996) reported a mean total breast milk con centration of 0.6\u00b10.4 ppb (range, 0.1-2.0 ppb) for a group of Swedish women that consumed freshwater fish and had an average of 12 amalgam fillings. This was a smaller range in mercury concentrations than that reported by Skerfving (1988). All of these general population breast milk mercury concentr ations are in sharp contrast to those reported for samples collected from women in Minamata, Japan, where industrial effluents containing methylmercurycaused widespread contamination of local seafood. Br east milk total mercury concentrations were on the order of 63 ppb in individuals who lived in the vici nity of Minamata, Japan and had consumed highly mercury-contaminated fish (Fujita and Takabatake 1977). Similarly, in Iraq, where consumption of bread made from seed grain treated with methylmercury as a fungicide caused a similar mercury poisoningoutbreak, breast milk concentrations as high as 200 ppb were reported (Bakir et al. 1973). Breast milk containing total mercury levels of >4 ppb would ex ceed the safe level (2 \u00b5g methylmercury/day for an average 5-kg infant) (Wolff 1983). It is important to emphasize, however, that in general, the beneficial effects associated with breast feeding seem to override or at least compensate for any neurotoxic effects on milestone development that could be due to the presen ce of contaminants, such as mercury, in human milk (Egeland et al. 1997). MERCURY 446 5. POTENTIAL FOR HUMAN EXPOSURE Hair. Scalp hair is another primary indicator used to assess methylmercury exposure, because the methylmercury is incorporated into the hair at the ha ir follicle in proportion to its content in the blood (EPA 1996d). The typical hair-to-blood ratio in humans has been estimated to be about 250:1 expressed as \u00b5gHg/g hair to mg Hg/L blood, but some difficulties in measurements, inter-individual variation in bodyburden, differences in hair growth rat es, and variations in fresh and saltwat er fish intake have led to varying estimates (Birke et al. 1972; Skerfving 1974). Once incor porated into the hair strand, the methylmercury is stable and gives a longitudinal history of blood meth ylmercury levels (WHO 1990). Care must be exercised to ensure that the analysis of methylmercury levels in hair are not confounded by adsorption of mercury vapors or inorganic mercury onto the hair (Francis et al. 1982) Recent reference values for mercury levels in hair from non-exposed individuals in the general U.S. population are very limited. A summary of mercury c oncentrations in hair from residents (adults, men, women, and children) of several U.S. communities is presented in Table 5-18. Most of the these studies, however, with the exception of Fleming et al. ( 1995) were conducted from 7 to 20 years ago. For populations studied in the United States, the range in mean hair concentrations was 0.47-3.8 ppm for adults (maximum value of 15.6 ppm) and 0.46-0.77 ppm for children (maximum value of 11.3 ppm). The meanconcentration of mercury in hair based on a review of existing data from other countries is 2 \u00b5g/g (ppm) (WHO 1990), and the WHO advisory maximum tolerable level for hair is 6 ppm. The concentration of total mercury in hair in the general population of Japan w as determined by Nakagawa (1995). This author sampled hair from 365 healthy volunteers in Tokyo and the surrounding area from June1992 to June 1993. The mean concentration of me rcury in hair was higher in males (2.98 ppm, 81 individuals sampled) than in females (2.02 ppm, 284 individuals sampled). In both males and females,the mercury concentration in hair increased with age up to the mid-30s, then gradually declined. The authors also looked at dietary preferences and found the mean hair levels in males and females were highest in individuals that had a preference for fish (4.0 a nd 2.7 ppm, respectively), followed by those with a preference for fish and meat (2.88 and 2.00 ppm, respectively), a preference for meat (2.38 ppm and1.96 ppm, respectively), and was lowest in those indivi duals that preferred a predominantly vegetarian diet (2.27 and 1.31 ppm, respectively). In an earlier study, the mercury content in human hair was studied inJapanese couples, with husbands having significantly highe r mercury concentrations (4.01 ppm) than wives (1.99 ppm), possibly as a result of greater fish consumption among the men (Chen et al. 1990). This samepattern is also apparent for all but one of the U.S. populations (San Diego, California) studied by Airey (1983b). It is noteworthy that some of the highest mercury concentrations in hair measured in women MERCURY 449 5. POTENTIAL FOR HUMAN EXPOSURE (15.2 ppm) were from Nome, Alaska where the population consumes large amounts of fish and marine mammals (Lasora and Citterman 1991) and from Florid a (15.6 ppm), where measurements were made only in adults that consumed wildlife from the Everglades area, a region where high mercury levels in wildlife have been reported (Fleming et al. 1995). Most recently , Davidson et al. (1998) reported the results of the Seychelles Child Development Study at 66 months (5.5 years) post-parturition. These researchers reported that there were no adverse neurodevelopmental outco mes observed in mother-child pairs, with mean maternal and mean child hair total mercury concentr ations of 6.8 ppm and 6.5 ppm, respectively, in the Seychelles Island study. Oral Tissues. Mercury concentrations as high as 380 \u00b5g/g (ppm) have been found in oral tissues in contact with amalgam fillings. In individuals with mo re than six amalgam fillings, a mean value of 2.3 \u00b5g/g (ppm) was found in tissue without direct contact with amalgam fillings (Bj\u00f6rkman et al. 1997). In someEuropean countries, health authorities recommend that sensitive or susceptible individuals in higher risk groups (i.e., pregnant women and i ndividuals with kidney disease) avoid treatment with dental amalgam (Bj\u00f6rkman et al. 1997). Occupational Exposure. Workplace environments presenting the largest potential sources of occupational exposure to mercury include chloralk ali production facilities, cinnabar mining and processing operations, and industrial facilities involved in the manuf acture and/or use of instruments containing liquid mercury (Stokinger 1981). According to NIOSH (1973) , the principal route of occupational exposure to mercury is vapor phase inhalation from workplace atmos pheres. Studies by Barregard et al. (1992) and by Langworth et al. (1992b) revealed increased total mercur y levels in blood and urine of exposed chloralkali workers. These results are summarized in Table 5-19. Personal air sampling of workers in a mercury recycling plant in Germany showed me rcury levels ranging from 115 to 454 \u00b5g/m 3 (Schaller et al. 1991). Human tissues that are routinely mon itored as evidence of exposure to mercury are urine, blood, and hair. Urine is most frequently monitored as an indicator of human body burden following chronic exposure to mercury vapor, particularly in o ccupational settings; approximately 95% of all urine samples contain less than 20 \u00b5g /L (ppb) (EPA 1984b). A comparison of mercury content in the urine of Swedish workers exposed to high levels of mercur y, dentists, occupationally unexposed workers, and unexposed workers without dental amalgams gave values of 15, 1.7, 0.8, and 0.3 \u00b5mol/mol creatinine, respectively (corresponding mercury plasma levels were 35, 9.4, 5. 3, and 2.8 nmol/L [7.19, 1.89, 1.06, and 0.56 ppt], respectively) (Molin et al. 1991). Blood and urine monitoring may be useful for groups of workers subject MERCURY 451 5. POTENTIAL FOR HUMAN EXPOSURE to chronic exposure to mercury, but the relative cont ribution of recent exposures to mercury levels in these media, in comparison to releases of mercury stored in tissues as a result of earlier exposures, is not wellunderstood (EPA 1984b) (see Section 2.5). Mercury exposure also may result from the transport of mercury to a workers' home on contaminated clothing and shoes (ATSDR 1990; Hudson et al. 1987; Zi rschky 1990). Increased exposure to mercury has been reported in children of workers who are occ upationally exposed (Hudson et al. 1987). The population of children at highest risk are those whose parent s work in facilities that use mercury, but where no protective uniforms or footgear are used. The mercury is thought to be transferred to the workers' homes in their clothing and shoes. While prevention of em ployee-transported contamination to their homes is preferred, cleaning the homes of workers occupationally exposed to mercury is also effective in reducing exposure for family members (Zirschky 1990). In an exposure study of families of workers at a chloralkaliplant in Charleston, Tennessee, mercury levels in the air of the workers' homes averaged 0.92 \u00b5g/m 3 (ATSDR 1990). The use of fluorescent tube compactors by industrial facilities may also expose those operating the compactors and workers in adjacent areas to increased levels of mercury vapor if proper filters, scrubbingdevices, and ventilation are not used (Kirschner et al. 1988). Dentists and other dental professiona ls may have greater exposure to mercury as a result of preparing and applying dental amalgams (Ayyadurai and Krishnashamy 1988; al. (1989)sampled pituitary gland tissue from autopsies of 8 dent al staff and 27 control individuals in Sweden. These authors reported median mercury concentrations of 815 \u00b5g/kg (ppb) wet weight (range, 135-4,040 \u00b5g/kg) in pituitary tissue of dental staff (7 dentists and 1 dent al assistant), as compared to a median of 23 \u00b5g/kg (wet weight) in 27 individuals from the general population. None of the dental staff had been working immediately prior to their deaths, and in several cases, more than a decade ha d passed since the cessation of their clinical work. The number of amalgams did not correlate to pituitary gland concentrations in the controls. However, if two of the controls with the highest mercury concentrations were excluded (there was some evidence that these individuals had received occupational exposures), then the correlation was significant (p<0.01). In another study, Nylande r and Weiner (1991) also reported high mercury concentrations in the thyroid and pituitary glands , with a median of 1.1 \u00b5mol/kg (221 ppb) wet weight (range, 0.7-28 \u00b5mol/kg [140-5,617 ppb]) in the pituitary. th e median mercury concentration in the pituitary of the controls was 0.03-5.83 5. POTENTIAL FOR HUMAN EXPOSURE Naleway et al. (1991) reported results of a screen ing study conducted in 1985 and 1986 by the American Dental Association to analyze urinary mercury concentr ations in dentists and id entify those individuals with elevated urinary mercury levels. In 1985, 1,042 U.S. dentists were screened, and a mean urinary mercury level of 5.8 \u00b5g/L (ppb) (maximum 84 \u00b5g/L) was re ported. In 1986, 772 dentists screened had a mean urinary level of 7.6 \u00b5g/L (ppb) (maximum 115 \u00b5g/L). Their mean urinary mercury levels were substantially lower than pooled data (mean, 14.2 \u00b5g/L) from den tists participating in the screening program from 1975-1983 (Naleway et al. 1985). The authors noted a subs tantial decline, particularly during the last 5 years (1982-1986), which was attributed to better me rcury hygiene and the reduced use of amalgam restorations. This study also evaluated responses fro m a questionnaire survey of 480 dentists. The results indicated that those dentists reporting skin contact with mercury amalgam had mean urinary mercury levels of 10.4 \u00b5g/L (ppb), compared to 6.3 \u00b5g/L (ppb) in dentists reporting no skin c ontact; this difference was found to be statistically significant. Similarly, the m ean urinary mercury level in dentists reporting mercury spills in the office was 7.8 \u00b5g/L (ppb), compared to 6.0 \u00b5g/L (ppb) for those reporting no mercury spills. Again, the difference was significant. Additionally, the number of hours practiced per week was found toweakly correlate with urinary mercury concentrations (Naleway et al. 1991). Painters are another group that may be occupationa lly exposed to mercury vapors from volatilization of mercury during application of paint containing phenylmercuric acetate. Hefflin et al. (1993) studied the extent of mercury exposure from the application of exte rior latex paints. These authors compared the air and urinary mercury concentrations of 13 professional ma le painters with those of 29 men having other occupations (nonpainters). The painters applied 2 brands of exterior late x paint that contained mercury; the median concentration was 570 mg/L (ppm). The medi an air mercury concentration was higher for painters (1.0 \u00b5g/m 3; range, non-detectable to 4 \u00b5g/m3) than for nonpainters (non-detected; range, not detected to 3 \u00b5g/m3). The median urinary mercury concentration was nearly twice as high for painters (9.7 \u00b5g/L [ppb]; range, 5.9-20.4 \u00b5g/L) \u00b5g/L (ppb) (EPA 1984b). Among the professional painters, urinary mercury concentrations increased with the percentage of time spent applying the exterior paint. Tichenor and Guo (1991) also studied the amount of merc ury emitted from latex paints containing mercury compounds. The concentrations of mercury in the 5 types of paint tested ranged from 93 ppm to 1,060 ppm. These authors also reported that from 12 to 57% of th e mercury in the paint was emitted upon application as elemental mercury, with the highest emission rate within the first few hours after paint application. MERCURY 453 5. POTENTIAL FOR HUMAN EXPOSURE Commercial artists and crafts people are another group that is also at risk of mercury exposure from a variety of professional arts and crafts materials and techniqu es (Grabo 1997). This author reported that mercury was a hazard to commercial artists using mercury-based pigm ents in airbrush painting, brush paintings, and in pastels via pigment in chalk dusts. The author c oncluded that occupational health professions should be aware of toxic nature of the materials used by artists , whether they are employed in industry, self-employed, or are hobbyists. Chemists are another group at risk of occupational exposure as a result of activities involving the synthesis of mercury compounds or the analysis of environmental or biological samples containing mercury residues. Methylmercury compounds are still used in laboratory-b ased research, and so the possibility of occupational exposure remains. Junghans (1983) reviewed the t oxicity of methylmercury compounds associated with occupational exposures attributable to laboratory use. Most recently, a poisoning incident was reported from a single acute exposure to dimethylmercury (Blayney et al. 1997). The analytical chemist involved wasexposed to approximately 0.1-0.5 mL of dimethylme rcury spilled on disposable platex gloves during a transfer procedure in a fume hood, while preparing a mercury nuclear magnetic resonance standard. Blood analyses 5 months after the exposure incident reveal ed a whole blood mercury concentration of 4,000 \u00b5g/L (ppb), which is 80 times the usual toxic threshold (50 \u00b5g/L) and 400 times the normal mercury blood range (<10 \u00b5g/L) (Blayney et al. 1997). These authors caution that highly resistant laminate gloves should beworn under a pair of long-cuffed unsupported neoprene, nitr ile, or similar heavy duty gloves rather than latex or polyvinyl chloride (PVC) gloves. Another group of analytical chemists (Toribara et al. 1997) reportedthat during the calibration of a mass spectrometer, an ope rator used a pipette with a plastic tip to transfer dimethylmercury into a Pyrex glass vial equipped with a crimp top for a Teflon-lined silicone stopper in a fume hood. After transfer, the plastic tip was disposed of in a nearby wastebasket and, in a short time, the instrument (which can detect nanogram quantities of mercury) showed measurable quantities in theworkplace air around the instrument and operator. Toribara et al. (1997) also cites three other historicincidents where laboratory staff and non-laboratory staff (secretaries) working in proximity to adimethylmercury spill were poisoned. These authors caution colleagues about the hazards involved inshipping dimethylmercury, if the packaging and c ontainer is physically damaged during transport. The National Occupational Exposure Survey (NO ES) conducted by NIOSH from 1980 to 1983 estimated that 67,551 workers, including 21,153 women in 2,877 workplaces were potentially exposed to mercury inthe workplace (NIOSH 1984b). Most of these workers were employed in the health services, business services, special trade contractor, and chemical and allied products industries as chemical technicians,MERCURY 454 5. POTENTIAL FOR HUMAN EXPOSURE science technicians, registered nurses, and mach ine operators. These estimates were derived from observations of the actual use of mercury (97% of to tal estimate) and the use of trade-name products known to contain mercury (3%). It is unknown how many of the potentially exposed workers were actually exposed. Data from the NOES conducted by NIOSH from 1983 to 1986 was broken out by exposure to a variety of mercury compounds (RTECS 1998). Estimates of the total numbers of all workers and women workers potentially exposed are presented in Table 5-20. A total of 151,947 workers were potentially exposed to mercury or various mercury compounds ; 33% (50,468) of these workers were women. Table 5-21 summarizes the calculated mercury absorp tion from air at various occupational exposure guideline concentrations. 5.6 EXPOSURES OF CHILDREN This section focuses on exposures from conception to matu rity at 18 years in humans and briefly considers potential pre-conception exposure to germ cells. Differences from adults in susceptibility to hazardous substances are discussed in Sec tion 2.6, Children's Susceptibility. Children are not small adults. A child's exposure may differ from an adult's exposure in many ways. Children drink more fluids, eat more food, and breathe more air per kilogram of body weight, and have a larger skin surface in proportion to their body volume. A child's diet often differs from that of adults. The developing human's source of nutrition changes with age: from placental nourishment to breast milk or formula to the diet of older children who eat more of certain types of foods than adults. A child's behavior and lifestyle also influence exposure. Children crawl on the floor; they put things in their mouths; they may ingest inappropriate things such as dirt or paint ch ips; they spend more time outdoors. Children also are closer to the ground, and they do not have the j udgement of adults in avoiding hazards (NRC 1993). Significant health risks, including numerous neuropat hological and neurobehavioral effects, are associated with prenatal exposure to methylmercury (Zeliko ff et al. 1995). Fetuses and breast-fed infants may be exposed to higher than background concentrations of mercury via maternal consumption of large amounts of fish or marine mammals contaminated with mercur y, via maternal exposure to mercury through dental amalgams, via maternal use of consumer products containing mercury or various mercury compounds, and via occupational exposure of the mother (Zelikoff et al. 1995). Fetuses can be exposed to mercury via exposures of their mothers either before or duri ng pregnancy; nursing infants can be exposed via consumption of contaminated breast milk from moth ers exposed via medical, domestic, or occupational MERCURY 457 5. POTENTIAL FOR HUMAN EXPOSURE exposures (see Section 5.7). Children can be exposed to various forms of mercury in a variety of ways, including playing with unsecured elemental mercury, inha lation of mercury vapors via the religious or ethnic practices of their parents or unintentional spills of elem ental mercury, oral ingestion of herbal or ethnic remedies or mercury-containing cons umer products, consumption of methylmercury-contaminated fish and wildlife, and dermal or oral exposure to contaminated soils and sediments. Mercury concentrations have been measured in cord bl ood in one study in the United States with levels that suggest prenatal exposure. Pitkin et al. (1976) m easured concentrations of total mercury in cord blood samples from 100 maternal cord blood pairs from a popula tion in rural Iowa. The mean cord blood total mercury concentration was 1.24 ppb, while the mean of the paired maternal blood samples was 1.01 ppb. More recently, Wheatley and Paradis (1995a, 1995b) re ported on the analysis of 2,405 cord blood samples collected from Canadian aboriginal peoples over th e last 20 years. Of these cord blood samples, 523 (21.8%) were found to have total me rcury levels greater than 20 ppb, with the highest cord blood sample containing 224 ppb. These latter samples were from popula tions that routinely consumed fish and marine mammal tissues. Grandjean et al. (1997b) measured cord blood samples from 894 Faroe Islands childrenwhose mothers consumed large amounts of fish and p ilot whale meat. The methylmercury exposure in the Faroe Island population is mainly from eating pilot whale meat. The geometric mean concentration of total mercury in these cord blood samples was 22.9 ppb. Concentrations of mercury have also been measured in breast milk from several populations in the United States as well as other countries (see Table 5-17). Breast milk concentrations have been reported for two U.S. populations; one in rural Iowa (Pitkin et al. 1976) and the other from Alaska (Galster 1976). Pitkin et al. (1976) reported a total mean mercury concentra tion in breast milk of 0.9\u00b10.23 ppb (range, 0.8-1.6 ppb). The mean total mercury concentrations in the Al askan populations were 3.3\u00b1 0.5 ppb for the urban population, 3.2\u00b10.8 ppb for the interior population, a nd 7.6\u00b12.7 ppb for the coastal population that consumed fish and marine mammals. Total mercury concentrations in breast milk from other countries and exposure scenarios were 3.6\u00b12.2 ppb for an urban population in Tokyo, Japan (Fujita a nd Takabatake 1977), 0.6\u00b10.4 ppb for Swedish women that were fish consumers with 12 dental amalgams (Oskarsson et al. 1996), 0.2-6.3 ppb (range) for Swedish women that consumed fish (Skerfving 1988), and 9.5\u00b1 5.5 ppb for an urban population of women in Madrid, Spain (Baluja et al. 1982) (Table 5-17). Some of the highest levels were reported in fish eaters, and about 20% of the total mercury content of the milk was methylmercury. The median and maximum mercuryMERCURY 458 5. POTENTIAL FOR HUMAN EXPOSURE concentrations in breast milk from women in the Fa roe Islands, a population that consumes large quantities of fish and marine mammal tissue, were 2.45 and 8.7 ppb, respectively (Grandjean et al. 1995a). Breast milk mercury concentrations reported by these authors were significantly associated with mercury concentrations in cord blood and with the frequency of pilot whale dinners during pregnancy. These are relatively low values in contrast to the values reported in Minamata, Japan, for women who ate contaminated seafood in the Minamata episode, which resu lted in total mercury concentrations in breast milk of 63 ppb (Fujita and Takaba take 1977), and in Iraq, where consumption of homemade bread prepared from methylmercury-contaminated wheat occurred, resulted in breast milk concentrations of up to 200 ppb (about 60%) methylmercury (Amin-Zaki et al. 1976; Bakir et al. 1973). Children can be exposed to mercury by many of the same pathways as adults as discussed in Sections 5.4.4., 5.5, and 5.7. Children can receive mercury exposures from oral or dermal contact with mercury-contaminated soils and sediments or mercury-contaminated objects. Exposure analysis ofindividuals living near an abandoned mercury-contamin ated industrial site suggested that children were exposed primarily via soil ingestion (Nublein et al. 1995). Little experimental information on the bioavailability of mercury via oral or dermal expos ure was found relative to mercury or mercury compounds sorbed to contaminated soils and sediments (De Rosa et al. 1996). Paustenbach et al. (1997) noted that, due to the presence of mercury at a number of major contam inated sites in the United States, the bioavailability of inorganic mercury following ingestion has emerged as an important public health issue. Although precise estimates are not available, in vivo and in vitro estimates of the bioavailability of different inorganic mercury species in different matrices suggest that the bioavailability of these mercury species in soil is likely to be significantly less (on the order of 3 to 10 fold), than the bioavailability of mercuric chloride, the mercury species used to derive the toxicity criteria for inorganic mercury (Paustenbach et al. 1997). These authors suggest that site specific estimates of bi oavailability be conducted of various mercury compounds because bioavailability can vary significantly with soil type, soil aging, the presence of co-contaminants and other factors. Canady et al. (1997) concluded th at the \"100% bioavailability assumption\" for mercury- contaminated soils is excessively conservative. These authors note that various mercury compounds have distinctly different bioavailability. For example, merc uric chloride has been reported to be approximately 20-25% bioavailable in adult animals (Nielsen and Andersen 1990; Schoof and Nielsen 1997). Methylmercury is thought to be nearly completely ab sorbed (Aberg et al. 1969; Miettinen et al. 1971; Rice 1989a, 1989b). Mercuric nitrate was reported to be only 15% bioavailable in humans (Rahola et al. 1973) and elemental mercury is thought to be very poorly ab sorbed, although experimental evidence is lacking for the latter. Recently, Barnett et al. (1997) reported that analysis of mercury contaminated soil from the flood MERCURY 459 5. POTENTIAL FOR HUMAN EXPOSURE plain of East Fork Poplar Creek in Oak Ridge, Te nnessee, revealed the presence of submicron, crystalline mercuric sulfide (HgS) in the form of metacinnabar. The HgS formed in place after the deposition and burial of mercury-contaminated soils. The formation of HgS is significant for remediation efforts at the sitebecause the toxicity, leachability, and volatility of me rcury in soils are dependent on the solid phase speciation. Because local hydrogeochemical conditions ar e not unique, the formation of HgS at this site has implications to other environments and contaminated sites as well. Children may be exposed to mercury vapors when they play with metallic mercury. Metallic mercury is a heavy, shiny, silver liquid and when spilled, forms little balls or beads which fascinate children. Children come in contact with metallic mercury when they trespass in abandoned warehouses, closed factories, or hazardous waste sites (ATSDR 1997; George et al. 1996). Children also have taken metallic mercury from school chemistry and physics laboratories and abandoned warehouses (ATSDR 1997). Broken thermometers and other mercury-containing instrume nts or equipment (fluorescent light bulbs, barometers, blood pressure measurement equipment, and light switc hes) used in the home and in some children's sneakers that light up are other sources of metallic me rcury. Muhlendahl (1990) reported a case of chronic mercury intoxication in three children who were e xposed to vapors from a broken thermometer. The maximum urinary concentrations reported by this aut hor (8 months after the broken thermometer incident) were 250.5 \u00b5g/L for a 33-month-old girl, 266.3 \u00b5g/L girl, and 137.4 ppm for the 7-year-old brother 2 days after each patient received ch elation therapy with DMPS (2,3-dimercaptopropan-1- sulphonate). Sometimes children find containers of me tallic mercury which were disposed of improperly (ATSDR 1997), or adults intentionally or unint entionally bring home metallic mercury from work (Ehrenberg et al. 1991; Wendroff 1990). Metallic mercury evaporates to a greater extent as the airtemperature increases; when it is not stored in a clo sed container, children may be exposed to mercury vapors (ATSDR 1997; Wendroff 1991). Metallic mercury is traditionally used in some religi ous rituals or remedies, including religions such as Santeria (a Cuban-based religion that worships bot h African deities and Catholic saints), voodoo (a Haitian- based set of beliefs and secret rites), Palo Mayombe (a secret form of ancestor worship practiced mainly in the Caribbean), or Espiritismo (a spiritual belief sy stem native to Puerto Rico) (Wendroff 1990). If these rituals or spiritual remedies containing mercury are u sed in the home, children may be exposed and the house may be contaminated with mercury (ATSDR 1997; Johnson [in press]; Wendroff 1990, 1991; Zayas and 1996). Metallic mercury is sold under the name \"azogue\" (pronounced ah-SEW-gay) in stores (sometimes called botanicas) which specialize in re ligious items and ethnic remedies (Johnson [in press]; MERCURY 460 5. POTENTIAL FOR HUMAN EXPOSURE Wendroff 1990; Zayas and Ozuah 1996). Azogue may be recommended by family members, spiritualists, card readers, and santeros. Typically, azogue is carri ed on one's person in a sealed pouch, or it is ritually sprinkled in the home or car. Some store owners s uggest mixing azogue in bath water or perfume. Some people place azogue in devotional candles. Because meta llic mercury evaporates into the air, there is a potential health risk from exposure to mercury vapors in a room where the mercury is sprinkled or spilled onto the floor, put in candles, or where open cont ainers of metallic mercury are present (ATSDR 1997; Wendroff 1990, 1991). Young children spend a lot of time crawling on the floor and carpeting, so they may be subject to a higher risk of exposure, especially when mercury is sprinkled on the floors or carpets. Very small amounts of metallic mercury (i.e., a few drops ) may raise air concentrations of mercury to levels that could be harmful to health (ATSDR 1997). Meta llic mercury and its vapors are extremely difficult to remove from clothes, furniture, carpet, floors, walls, and other such items. The mercury contamination can remain for months or years, and may pose a significan t health risk for people continually exposed (ATSDR 1997; Johnson [in press]; Wendroff 1990, 1991). Another potential source of children's exposure to meta llic mercury is breakage or improper disposal of a variety of household products, including thermost ats, fluorescent light bulbs, barometers, glass thermometers, and some blood pressure machines th at contain metallic mercury (ATSDR 1997). These devices do not pose a health threat when the mercury is properly contained within the device. Should the mercury be released, however, the potential for merc ury vapors to contaminate the air increases. The appropriate method for cleaning up a spill of a small amount of mercury is to clean it up manually, without using a vacuum cleaner , which can cause the mercury to evaporate more rapidly into the air, creating a greater risk of exposure (ATSDR 1997; Schwartz et al. 1992; Votaw and Zey 1991). Votaw and Zey 1991 reported mean mercury concentrations in air sam ples collected in a dental office were 8.5 \u00b5/m3 when a vacuum cleaner was not in use and concentrations rose to 69 \u00b5/m3 when a vacuum cleaner was in use. Special techniques are often needed to prevent merc ury vapor from being generated in the cleanup process (Votaw and Zey 1991). The first consideration is to re move children from the area of the spill. The beads of metallic mercury should be cleaned up by carefully rolli ng them onto a sheet of paper or by drawing them up into an eye dropper. After the mercury has been collected, it should be put in a plastic bag or airtightcontainer. The piece of paper or eye dropper used to remove the mercury should also be bagged and disposed of properly, according to guidance provided by the local health department. After the mercury has been removed, the room should be ventilated to the outsi de and closed off to the rest of the house. Electric fans should be used for a minimum of one hour to speed the ventilation process. If larger quantities ofMERCURY 461 5. POTENTIAL FOR HUMAN EXPOSURE metallic mercury are found in a container, make sure the container is airtight and call the local health department for disposal instructions. If the contai ner of mercury is open without a lid, a piece of plastic wrap can be used to seal the container. If the la rger amount is spilled, leave the area immediately and contact the local health department or fire de partment. Members of the general public should seek professional guidance on proper disposal procedures of mercury (ATSDR 1997). Metallic mercury vapors are very toxic and are virtually odorless. Inhalation of mercury-laden dust, vapor, or mist should be avoided. Metallic mercury not should not come in contact with eyes, skin, or clothing. If children are exposed directly to metallic mercury, the contaminated body area should be thoroughly washed, and contaminated clothing should be removed and disposed of in a sealed plastic bag (ATSDR 1997). ATSDR and EPA recommend very strongly against the u se of any uncontained metallic (liquid) mercury in homes, automobiles, day care centers, schools, offices, and other public buildings. If a child has metallic mercury on his or her clothing, skin, or hair, the fire department should be advised and the child should be properly decontaminated (ATSDR 1997). Some Chinese herbal remedies for stomach disorders contain mercury (probably as mercury sulfide). If these herbal remedies are made into teas and are given to children, they increase the risk of harmful effects (Espinoza et al. 1995, 1996). Some remedies are in the form of herbal balls, which are aromatic, malleable,earth-toned, roughly spherical, hand-rolled mixtures of primarily herbs and honey. These herbal balls are used as a self-medication for a wide variety of c onditions, including fever, rheumatism, apoplexy, and cataracts. Herbal balls similar to those analyzed by Espinoza et al. (1995, 1996) are readily available in specialty markets throughout the United States. Inges ting two herbal balls (the recommended adult dose per day) could theoretically provide a dose of up to 1,200 mg mercury; even if the mercury is in the form of mercuric sulfide, a relatively less bioavailable form, th ere is an increased risk of mercury entering the body. If a pregnant woman or nursing mother uses mercury-containing herbal remedies, she may also pass themercury to her unborn child or nursing infant via breast milk. Herbal remedies that contain mercury should be stored so that children can not reach them to prevent accidental poisoning. Consumers should check the ingredients of any prescription or non-prescription medicine. Hoet and Lison(1997) recently reported an unusual non-occupational source of mercury exposure in a woman who used prescription nasal drops over a long period of time th at contained 300 mg/L (ppm) borate phenylmercury. Prescription medicines that contain mercury should be stored out of children's reach to avoid accidentalpoisoning.MERCURY 462 5. POTENTIAL FOR HUMAN EXPOSURE Children may be exposed to mercury during play at hom e or in school when using art supplies that contain colors from mercury compounds. Rastogi and Pritzi ( 1996) reported the migration of several toxic metals including mercury from crayons and artist watercolor pa ints (see Section 5.4). Migration of mercury from these art supply products occurred in 57% of the samples tested. The authors believe that children might be exposed not only to mercury, but to several other meta ls that can migrate from the paints. Grabo (1997) also reported that artists may be exposed to mercury b ecause it is a main component in airbrush and brush painting pigments as well as a component of pastel ch alks. Artist supplies that contain mercury should be stored out of children's reach to avoid accidental poisoning. Infants and developing fetuses may be exposed to methylmercury if their mothers consume certain methylmercury-contaminated fish, shellfish, or wild life species from contaminated waters prior to their pregnancy, during their pregnancy, or while nursing. Older children also may be exposed to methylmercury by eating contaminated fish and wildlife species. Cert ain states, Native American tribes, and U.S. Territories have issued fish and wildlife advisories for mercury in fresh water, estuarine, and saltwater fish and in freshwater turtles (see Section 5.7). In a study of lactating women, Oskarsson et al. (1996) assessed the total and inorganic mercury content in breast milk and blood in relation to fish consumption and amalgam fillings (see Section 5.5). In breast milk samples collected 6 weeks after delivery, about half of the total mercury was inorganic and half was methylmercury, whereas in blood samples only 26% was inorganic and 74% was methylmercury. Exposure of the infant to mercury from breast milk was cal culated to range up to 0.3 \u00b5g/kg/day, of which approximately one-half was inorganic mercury. This exposure corresponds to approximately one-half the tolerable daily intake of total mercury for adults r ecommended by WHO. The authors concluded that efforts should be made to decrease total mercury burden in women of reproductive age (Oskarsson et al. 1996). Two-year-old children seem to be different in their weight-adjusted intake of methylmercury as shown by the results of the FDA Total Diet Study. Expressed on a per weight basis, methylmercury intake for all age groups except 2-year-old children was approximate ly 50 ng/kg/day (Clarkson 1990; Gunderson 1988). For 2-year-old children, the intake was estimated to be approximately 100 ng/kg/day (assuming 50% of the fish intake was due to fish caught locally) or about twi ce as much methylmercury intake per body weight as for other age groups. For additional details, see Section 5.5, General Population a nd Occupational Exposure. MERCURY 463 5. POTENTIAL FOR HUMAN EXPOSURE Parental exposure can result in subsequent exposure to the developing child or embryo. Anttila and Sallmen (1995) report some epidemiologic data suggesting that paternal exposure to mercury is associated with an increase in spontaneous abortions. These authors also re port that maternal exposure to mercury has not been has not been associated with an incr eased risk of abortion. Lauwerys et al. (1987) reported a case of mercury poisoning in a 3-month-old infant whose mother frequen tly used a skin lightening cream and soap containing inorganic mercury during pregnancy and the 1-month lactation period following birth. Prenatal and early postnatal exposure of infants to mercury from matern al use of these products is a source of particular concern (Lauwerys et al. 1987). Data from the National Occupational Exposure Su rvey (NOES) conducted by NIOSH from 1983 to 1986, provides information on exposure to a variety of merc ury compounds, with estimates of the total numbers of workers and the total number of female workers pot entially exposed. As presented in Table 5-19, an estimated 50,468 women (33% of workers) were pot entially exposed to mercury and various mercury compounds in occupational setti ngs during 1983-1986 (RTECS 1998). More current estimates are not available for the number of women occupationally exposed to mercury in the United States or the percentage of women of reproductive age that may become pregnant or may breast-feed their infants while continuing towork in these occupational settings. Mercury exposure also may result from the transport of mercury to a workers' home on contaminated clothing and shoes (ATSDR 1990; Hudson et al. 1987; Zi rschky 1990). Increased exposure to mercury has been reported in children of workers who are occ upationally exposed to the compound (Hudson et al. 1987). Hudson et al. 1987 investigated the exposure to me rcury of children of workers in a thermometer manufacturing plant. These investigators reported that the median mercury concentrations in the homes was 0.25 \u00b5g/m 3 (range, 0.02-10 \u00b5g/m3), and the levels of mercury in the urine of the children averaged 25 \u00b5g/L (ppb), about five times higher than that reported fo r the controls. While measurements of clothing contamination were not made, the authors noted that elevated mercury concentrations were found in places where work clothes were located and in some washing machines. The children at the highest risk are those whose parents work in facilities that use mercury, but where no protective uniforms or footgear are used. The mercury from these settings is thought to be transferred to the workers' homes on their clothing andshoes. Danzinger and Possick (1973) reported that mercury particles became embedded in the clothing of workers at a scientific glassware plant, especially in knitted fabrics. In an exposure study of families of workers at a chloralkali plant in Charleston, Tennessee, mercury levels in the air of the workers' homes averaged 0.92 \u00b5g/m 3 (ATSDR 1990). Although protective clothing was used, work gloves, clothes, andMERCURY 464 5. POTENTIAL FOR HUMAN EXPOSURE boots which were soaked with mercury were take n home, exposing family members. Cases of mine workers' homes being contaminated have also been reported, although the authors did not address the impact of this contamination on the health of the fam ily members (West and Lim 1968). Although prevention of this kind of employee transport of mercury to homes is preferred, cleaning homes of workers occupationally exposed to mercury can be effective in reduci ng exposure for family members (Zirschky 1990). 5.7 POPULATIONS WITH POTENTIALLY HIGH EXPOSURES In addition to individuals who are occupationally exposed to mercury (Section 5.5), there are several groups within the general population with potentially hi gh exposures (i.e., higher th an background levels) to metallic mercury and various mercury compounds. Hist orically, populations that have been exposed to higher-than-normal background levels of mercury in the air, water, soil, and/or food have included populations near industrial discharges (e.g., Minamata and Niigata, Japan) and those who inadvertently consumed methylmercury-contaminated food (e.g ., grain in Iraq) (WHO 1990, 1991). People living in proximity to former mercury production facilities or mines, secondary mercury production (recycling) facilities, chloralkali facilities, municipal and medi cal waste incinerators, other mercury-disposal or recycling facilities, or the 714 current or former NPL hazardous waste sites where mercury has been detected (HazDat 1998) are at risk of receiving potentially higher-than-normal background levels of exposure. Populations with potentially high exposure include recr eational and subsistence fishers and hunters, Native American populations who routinely consume larger amounts of locally caught fish than the general population or who consume marine mammals in their di et. Other populations with potential for higher than average exposures are individuals with large numbers of dental amalgams, those who use various consumer products containing mercury (i.e., skin lightening creams and soaps, ethnic remedies, or fingerpaints andmake-up paints containing mercury or mercury co mpounds), and those living or working in buildings recently painted with mercury-contai ning latex paints or buildings where mercury has been intentionally or unintentionally spilled. Individuals Living Near Mercury Production, Use, and Disposal Sites. Individuals in the general population living in the vicinity of former primary production or mining sites or current secondary production sites, chloralkali plants, pulp and paper m ills, coal-fired power plants, facilities where mercury is released (e.g., municipal waste or medical waste incine rators or other waste disposal facilities), or hazardousMERCURY 465 5. POTENTIAL FOR HUMAN EXPOSURE waste sites may be exposed to mercury through several exposure pathways, including inhalation, dermal, and oral exposures. For example, numerous studies have repor ted increased levels of mercury in air, water, soil, plants, and fish in areas surrounding industrial facilities involved in production or use of mercury (Harnly et al. 1997; Lodenius and Tulisalo 1984; Shaw et al. 1986; Yamaguchi et al. 1971). Significant concentrations of mercury have been detected in sewer overflow s and urban runoff (Murphy and Carleo 1977). Thus, general population exposure to mercur y may be higher in both industrial and urban areas. Mercury has been detected in various environmental media (air, surf ace water, groundwater, soil, sediment, and fish and wildlife samples) collected at some of the 714 NPL sit es where it has been detected in some environmental media (HazDat 1998). Populations living near hazardous waste sites may be at risk for exposure to high levels of mercury as a result of mercury contamin ation of surface waters, groundwater, soils, or fish. However, the available data are insufficient to allo w for the characterization of the sizes of these populations or the intake levels of mercury to which they are exposed. In 1996, however, De Rosa et al. (1996) reported than in terms of populations at risk, an estimated 41 million people in the United States live within a 4-mile radius of at least one of the 1,134 NPL sites, and 3, 300 people live within a 1-mile radius of an NPL site. These authors also reported that metallic mercury w as ranked third on the top 10 priority list of hazardous substances found at these NPL sites. Adults may receive higher mercury exposures from dermal contact if they work with mercury-contaminated soils. Mercury has been detected in soil and sed iment at 350 and 208 sites, respectively, of the 714 NPL sites where it has been detected in some e nvironmental media (HazDat 1998). No experimental information on dermal exposure related to the bioava ilability of mercury or mercury compounds sorbed to soils was found. However, Hursh et al. (1989) conducted a study to determine the role of dermal exposure in the uptake of mercury vapor from air. These authors estimated that during an 8-hour day, a person wouldabsorb through the skin only 2.6% of the mercury vapor retained by the lungs exposed to the same atmosphere. These authors also noted that half of th e dermal uptake is lost through normal shedding of the stratum corneum. Therefore, dermal uptake of mercur y adsorbed to soil is likely to be minor compared to other exposure pathways. Recent information from Harnly et al. (1997) showed that urine mercury levels in a Native American population living near an inactive mercury mine in Clear Lake, California werecomparable to background levels, indicating that soil and dust exposures were not substantially elevated in the resident population near the inactive site. Howeve r, the mean blood methylmercury level in residents of this same community that consumed fish from Clear La ke was 15.6\u00b18.8 \u00b5g/L (ppb), which was more than 7 times higher than the mean blood level in individuals that did not consume fish from the lake (2 ppb). MERCURY 466 5. POTENTIAL FOR HUMAN EXPOSURE In addition, adults may receive potentially higher or al exposures from ingestion of mercury-contaminated soils from their unwashed hands while working in mercur y-contaminated areas. Bioavailability is an integral factor in the estimation of the internal dose (or dose at the target tissue) of the chemical. Like dermal absorption, gastrointestinal absorption of various form s of mercury is highly variable (see Section 2.3.1). The more lipid soluble organic mercury compounds (e.g ., methylmercury) are almost completely absorbed, while the extremely insoluble metallic mercury is poor ly absorbed through the gut. The bioavailability of mercury from soil is likely to vary, since mercury binds tightly to soil, especially to soils with high organic content. Therefore, the mercury soil concentration alone may not be indicative of the potential for human health hazard from contaminated soils, and site-specific evaluation of the bioavailability of the various forms of mercury at the site is essential. However, unl ess toxicokinetic studies that use soil samples from the specific site are available, it is difficult to specula te on how much mercury will be bioavailable at any particular site. Adults may also receive higher doses from routine consumption of mercury-contaminated home grown fruits and vegetables (Nublein et al. 1995) , and from consumption of fish from local waters receiving runoff or leachate from a waste site. Harnly et al. (1997) studied the impact of inorganic mercuryin soil and dust and organic mercury in fish on a Nativ e American population living near an inactive mercury mine near Clear Lake, California. These author s reported average methylmercury blood levels of 15.6\u00b17 \u00b5g/L (ppb) in individuals that consumed fi sh from Clear Lake, which was higher than blood levels reported for individuals that did not consume fish (2 ppb). A significant correlation of methylmercury blood levels and fish consumption was obser ved. Mercury has been detected in fish collected at 56 of the 714 NPL sites where it has been detected in some environm ental media (HazDat 1998). Adults may also receive higher mercury exposures from routine consumption of mercury-contaminated groundwater if this is the primary drinking water supply. Mercury has been detected in groundwater samples collected at 395 of the714 NPL sites where mercury has been detected in some environmental media (HazDat 1998). Individuals living near municipal and medical waste incinerators, power plants fired by fossil fuels (particularly coal fired plants), or hazardous waste s ites may inhale vapors or particulates contaminated with mercury from ambient outdoor air. Lipfert et al. (1996) evaluated the health risks of methylmercury fromburning coal using a Monte Carlo model to simulate a \"baseline\" and a \"worst case\" scenario in which apopulation of 5,000 fish eaters in the upper midwestern United States derived the freshwater fish portion oftheir diet from local waters near a large, hypothetical coal-fired power plant. The population wascharacterized by distributions of body mass, half-life of methylmercury, and the ratios of blood to bodyburden and hair to blood methylmercury. Each person' s diet consisted of varying amounts of tuna fish,MERCURY 467 5. POTENTIAL FOR HUMAN EXPOSURE freshwater sportfish, and marine fish and shellfish, the methylmercury content of which were characterized by national distribution statistics, as were the consump tion rates for marine fish. The consumption rates for freshwater fish were specific to the region. The fish portion size was linked to body mass by a variable correlation. Each meal was assumed to be an indepe ndent sample, so that as metabolic equilibrium was approached, each person's body burden of methylmercur y tended to approach the value corresponding to the mean methylmercury intake for the population. Predicti ons of methylmercury levels in hair by this model compared well with an observed distribution in 1,437 women. Two neurological end points were examined: adult paresthesia as related to methylmercury body burden and congenital neurological effects as associated with average concentrations of methylmercury in mate rnal hair during pregnancy. In the baseline exposure scenario, the source of the mercury in fish was background atmospheric deposition. In the worst-case scenario, local mercury deposition and concentrations in fish were roughly doubled to represent additional deposition from the hypothetical power plant. For bot h scenarios, the 99th percentile of methylmercury body burden was more than an order of magnitude be low the lowest level at which increased transient paresthesia in adults was experienced in an acute me thylmercury poisoning incident in Iraq. The authors concluded that neurological risks to adults from methylmercury resulting from atmospheric deposition are negligible. Based on three epidemiological studies of congenital neurological risks, they found that fetal effects appeared to be more critical, and that there is a smaller margin of safety for pregnant consumers of freshwater sportfish. However, there is still a cons iderable margin of safety, and uncertainties in the relationships between maternal hair mercury and act ual fetal exposures may have overstated the fetal risk (Lipfert et al. 1996). Recreational and Subsistence Fishers. Methylmercury concentrations in sport fish can be at least an order of magnitude higher than in commercial fi sh purchased in a supermarket (see Section 5.4.4). Therefore, recreational and subsistence fishers, including some Native American peoples who consume locally caught fish from mercury-contaminated water bodies or consume long-lived predatory oceanic species such as shark and swordfish, can be exposed to hi gher mercury concentrations than individuals who consume similar amounts of commercially marketed fish from a variety of sources (Ebert et al. 1996; EPA1995k). The exposure to mercury will also be higher among people who regularly eat fish and other seafood products, compared to those who only occasionally or never eat fish or other seafood products. This increased exposure has been demonstrated by blood mercury levels several times higher in people who regularly eat fish, compared to those who occasionally or never eat fish (Buzina et al. 1989; Cappon andSmith Phelps et al. 1980; Svensson et al. 1995). In addition, the consumption of certain species of fish (e.g., shark and swordfish) is likely to contribute disproportionately to the observedMERCURY 468 5. POTENTIAL FOR HUMAN EXPOSURE methylmercury body burden. Because mercury is associated primarily with muscle tissue in the body of a fish, rather than with fatty deposits, trimming and ski nning of mercury-contaminated fish does not reduce the mercury content of the fillet portion, as is the case fo r PCBs, dioxins, and other organochlorine pesticides (Armbuster et al. 1988; Gutenmann and Lisk 1991). Several recent studies have documented higher fish c onsumption rates among subsistence fishers, some of which are Native American populations. In 1990, th ere were an estimated 1,959,234 Native Americans in the United States, including 1,878,285 American Indians, 57,152 Eskimos, and 23,797 Aleuts (Paisano1998). Approximately 218,320 Native Americans were liv ing on ten reservations and tribal lands, and these people accounted for half of all Native Americans liv ing on reservations. Therefore, approximately 440,000 Native Americans live on reservations. The median family income in 1990 for Native Americans was $21,750, about 65% of the $35,225 median income of a ll U.S. families. In addition 27% of all Native Americans are living in poverty, compared with 10% of the general population. In a study of 11 Alaskancommunities, Nobmann et al. (1992) reported an averag e daily fish consumption rate of 109 g/day. This average consumption rate for subsistence fishers is mo re than 16.8 times the mean fish consumption rate of 6.5 g/day estimated for the general population (EPA 1995k). A recent study of fish consumption patterns among the Umatilla, Nez Perce, Yakama, and Warm Springs tribes of the Columbia River Basin in Washington and Oregon (CRITFC 1994) found that adults in these tribes consume an average of 59 g/day and that the 95th percentile of fishers consume 170 g/da y of fish. The mean consumption rate for the four tribes is more than nine times the mean fish cons umption rate estimated for the general population (EPA 1995k). Furthermore, the consumption rate for Nativ e American children (5 years and younger) from these four tribes was 20 g/day (a rate over 3 times that for adults in the general population) (see Section 5.6). In order to reduce methylmercury exposure from consum ption of mercury-contaminated fish and shellfish, consumption advisories are issued by states recommending that individuals restrict their consumption ofspecific fish and shellfish species from certain wate rbodies where mercury concentrations in fish and shellfish tissues exceed the human health level of concern. This level of concern is set by individual state agencies, but several states use the FDA action le vel of 1 ppm to issue advisories recommending no consumption or restricting consumption of contaminat ed fish and shellfish from certain waterbody types (e.g., lakes and/or rivers). The FDA value was d esigned to protect consumers from the health risks associated with consumption of fish and shellfish th at are shipped in interstate commerce and that are purchased in commercial markets. The FDA action leve l was not intended to be used as a criterion for theMERCURY 469 5. POTENTIAL FOR HUMAN EXPOSURE protection of high-end fish consumers who routinely and repeatedly consume large quantities of fish from local bodies of water. To address this concern, the EPA Office of Water issued guidance to states on sampling and analysis procedures to use in assessing the health risks from cons uming locally caught fish and shellfish. The risk assessment method proposed by EPA was designed to assist states in developing fish consumption advisoriesfor recreational and subsistence fishers, including pr egnant women, nursing mothers, and children in these high-end consumption populations ( EPA 1995k). Recreational and subs istence fishers consume larger quantities of fish and shellfish than the genera l population and frequently fish the same waterbodies routinely. Because of this, these populations are at greater risk of exposure to mercury and other chemicalcontaminants, if the waters they fish are contaminat ed. The EPA's Office of Water advises states to use a screening value of 0.6 ppm mercury (wet weight) in fillets for the general population as a criterion to evaluate their fishable waters (EPA 1995k). Curre ntly, 1,782 advisories restricting the consumption of mercury-contaminated fish and shellfish are in effect in 41 states and one U.S. Territory (American Samoa) (EPA 1998b). The number of mercury advisories currently in effect in each state is shown in Figure 5-7. It should be noted that mercury is the chemical pollutant responsible in part for over 77% of the fish advisories issued in the United States (EPA 1998a). It is importa nt to note that 11 states (Connecticut, Indiana, Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, Missouri, New Hampshire, New Jersey, North Carolina, Ohio, and Vermont) currently have state-wide mercury advisories recomme nding that residents restrict consumption of locally caught freshwater fish. In addition, 5 states (Alabama , Florida, Louisiana, Massachusetts, and Texas) have issued statewide coastal mercury a dvisories for specific marine fish and shellfish species. In two states (Arizona and Minnesota), wildlife advisories recomme nding that residents restrict their consumption of freshwater turtles have been issued. Subsistence Hunters. Native American populations, such as the Inuit of Alaska and other subsistence hunters (particularly those living in high latitude areas of the United States), may be exposed to mercury in wild game (e.g., seals, narwhal, walrus, and other game species or marine mammals). Mercury has been detected in liver, kidney, and muscle tissues of pilot wh ales, harp seals, narwhal, and walrus (Meador et al. 1993; Wagemann et al. 1995). Mean total mercury con centrations and methylmercury concentrations were highest in pilot whale liver tissue: 176 ppm (dry weight ) and 8 ppm (dry weight), respectively. In fish, almost all of the mercury (>95%) body burden is meth ylmercury (Bloom 1992), but in marine mammals, the percentage of inorganic mercury is much higher, at l east in liver tissue. For example, in Alaskan beluga whales, mean methylmercury levels were 0.788 ppm (\u00b5g/ g wet weight), but mean total mercury levels were MERCURY 471 5. POTENTIAL FOR HUMAN EXPOSURE 28 ppm (wet weight), in liver tissue (Becker et al. 1995). Similarly, in Alaskan ringed seal, mean methylmercury levels were 0.410 ppm (wet weight) and mean total mercury levels were 1.970 ppm (wet weight) in liver tissue. However, no information w as available for methylmercury levels in muscle tissue from Alaskan mammals. An older report by Smith and Armstrong (1975) also examined total mercury andmethylmercury levels in marine mammal livers eaten by native Inuit in the Northwest Territory of Canada. Smith and Armstrong (1975) reported to tal mercury concentrations of 143 and 26.2 ppm (wet weight) and mean methylmercury levels of 0.300 and 0.120 ppm (wet weight) in liver tissue of bearded seals sampled in1973 and 1974, respectively. Smith and Armstrong (1975) also reported total mercury concentrations of 27.5 ppm (wet weight) (maximum, 184 ppm), and 0.72 ppm in liver and muscle tissue, respectively, andmean methylmercury levels of 0.96 and 0.83 ppm in liver and muscle tissue, respectively, of ringed seals sampled near Victoria Island in Canada's Northwest Territory. These authors also reported a mean total mercury concentration of 143 ppm and a mean methylme rcury concentration of 0.30 ppm in liver tissue of bearded seals. The mean total mercury concentrati on in the muscle tissue of the bearded seals was 0.53 ppm (no methylmercury concentrations in muscl e tissue were available for this species). In Greenland, the percentage of total mercury th at was methylmercury in seal muscle tissue was 57-86%; however, the concentration of total mercury was very lo w. Mercury concentrations in the blood of mothers and infants in Greenland were closely correlated with the amount of marine mammal meat the mothersconsumed. Mercury concentrations in the blood of mothers eating primarily imported food ranged from 11.0 to 32.7 \u00b5g/L (ppb) and concentrations in the blood of their children ranged from 15.0 to 51.4 \u00b5g/L (ppb). In contrast, mercury concentrations in the blood of mo thers who consumed primarily a local diet heavy in marine animals ranged from 16.4 to 44.6 \u00b5g/L (ppb) and concentrations in the blood of their children ranged from 27.5 to 140.0 \u00b5g/L (ppb) (Hansen 1991). Native American populations that depend heavily on mari ne mammals are considered to be at higher risk than the general population. Wheatley and Paradis (1995a, 1995b) reported blood me rcury levels in native peoples from 514 communities across Canada. Of these individuals, 23% had me thylmercury blood levels >20 \u00b5g/L (the WHO assessment level), while 1.6% of these individuals had blood levels >100 \u00b5g/L (the WHO benchmark for at-risk populations). Native Ameri can populations in the western Arctic (Alaska) may be at similar risk as a result of their consumpti on of marine mammals, although no recent information on methylmercury concentrations in blood, hair or urin e for these populations was located. In Alaskan Inuit women that consume marine mammal tissue, Galster ( 1976) reported higher total me rcury levels in breast MERCURY 472 5. POTENTIAL FOR HUMAN EXPOSURE milk of women living in coastal areas (7.6\u00b12.7 ppb) than in breast milk of Inuit women living in the interior (3.2\u00b10.8 ppb) or in urban areas (3.3\u00b10.5 ppb). In a ddition, mercury red blood cell concentrations were also higher in Inuit women living in coastal areas (33.5\u00b15. 1 ppb), as compared to those living in the interior (22.6\u00b13.0 ppb) or in urban areas (8.9\u00b10.9 ppb). Higher mercury levels in coastal populations were attributed to higher consumption of seal meat and oil and marine fish (Galster 1976). By analogy to the Canadian populations of native peoples (Wheatley and Paradis 1995a, 1995b), it is anticipated that methylmercury concentrations in these tissues are likely to be hi gher among individuals who consume large quantities of marine mammal species with high concentrations of methylmercury (as well as inorganic mercury) in theirtissues than among members of the general population. In a study of subsistence economies in the State ofAlaska, Wolfe and Walker (1987) reported that tota l annual per capita harvest of wild game species (including land mammals, marine mammals, and fish ) ranged from 10 to 1,498 pounds (median harvest of 252 pounds), compared to 222 pounds of meat, fish, a nd poultry (combined) consumed each year per individual in the western United States. The wild game harvest in 84% of the 98 Alaskan subsistence communities surveyed was at least half or greater than the 222 pounds consumed in the western United States. Because hunters often share wild game they harvest with other family members, the amountharvested may not represent the actual amount consumed (Egeland et al. 1998). The average daily per capitaconsumption was estimated to be 0.67 pounds of fish and 0.23 pounds of land mammals based on all 98 communities, and 0.2 pounds of marine mammals based on the 41 coastal communities surveyed. Marinemammals consumed in these communities included seal, wa lrus, and whales. Subsistence hunters and their families are a population at potentially higher risk of mercury exposure, if the wild game species theyconsume are contaminated with high concentrations of inorganic and methylmercury. Although the existence of larger amounts of mercury in subsiste nce diets does give cause for concern, the available Alaskan data do not support the conclusion that current exposures are a serious problem for Alaskansubsistence hunters (Egeland et al. 1998). Individuals with Large Numbers of Dental Amalgams. Individuals with dental amalgams have greater exposure to elemental mercury than member s of the general population that do not have dental amalgams. Richardson (1995) computed a release rate per filled tooth surface of 0.73 \u00b5g/day-surface, with astandard deviation of 0.3 \u00b5g/day-surface and a \"stimul ation magnification factor\" of 5.3, based on a weighed average enhancement of mercury vapor concentrati on following chewing, eating, or tooth brushing MERCURY 473 5. POTENTIAL FOR HUMAN EXPOSURE reported in three amalgam studies. Patterson et al. (1985) measured elemental mercury in exhaled breath, and levels of mercury ranging from 0.0001 to 62 ng/L (ppb) (mean, 0.0082 \u00b5g/L [ppb]) were detected in to 0.000008-0.0001 \u00b5g/L (ppb) (mean, 0.00006 \u00b5g/L [ppb]) in 5 persons with no amalgams; however, these values were measured after the people had brushed their teeth. Jokstad et al. 1992 reported that mercury ur ine concentrations increased with increasing number of amalgams. Individuals with 36 to 39 dental amalga ms had mercury urine levels of 6 ppb compared to 1.2 ppb in individuals without amalgams. Mercury concentrations in whole blood were also higher in persons who ate no fish, but had >6 dental amalga m fillings (mean, 1.047\u00b10.797 \u00b5g/L [ppb] as compared to persons who did not eat fish and had no dental am algams (0.2\u00b10.4 \u00b5g/L [ppb]) (Schweinberg 1994). Individuals who have large num bers of dental amalgams installed or replaced at one time are likely to exhibit transient elevated blood and urine mercury levels (PHS 1995). Individuals Exposed to Consumer Products and Medicinal Products Containing Mercury. Individual who use various consumer products containing mercury (i.e., medicinal herbal remedies, skin lightening creams and soaps, laxatives, tattoo dyes, fi ngerpaints, and make-up paints) are also exposed to higher mercury levels than the ge neral population (Barr et al. 1973; Dy all-Smith and Scurry Espinoza et 1987; Rastogi 1992; Wendroff 1990). Metallic mercury has been used by Mexican American and As ian populations in traditional remedies for a variety of medical conditions, including chronic stomach disorders. Several papers have been published related to the use of metallic mercury as a folk remedy (ATSDR 1992, 1997; Department of Health Some Mexican-Americans believe that disorders of the alimentary tract may be caused by a bolus offood adhering to the stomach wall, a condition known as empacho . Geffner and Sandler (1980) reported cases of two young patients with acute gastroente ritis who received traditional remedies of oral administration of metallic mercury, presumably to dislodge the bolus. Both patients were successfully treated and released from the hospital after 2 and 10 days of treatment, respectively. Trotter (1985) reported that metallic mercury known as azogue is in common use in New Mexico and the bordering areas for treating this gastrointestinal condition, empacho. Metallic mercury was also implicated in two cases of mercury poisoning caused by the dermal application of an over-the-counter antilice product (Bourgeois et al. 1986). Wands et al. (1974) reported the deaths of two i ndividuals due to the excessive use of a laxative MERCURY 474 5. POTENTIAL FOR HUMAN EXPOSURE preparation containing mercurous chloride (calomel). Espinoza et al. (1995) reported that while examining imported Chinese herbal balls for the presence of pr oducts from endangered species, the authors detected potentially toxic levels of mercury and arsenic in certain herbal ball preparations. Herbal balls are aromatic, malleable, earth-toned, roughly spherical, hand-rolled mi xtures of primarily herbs and honey. These herbal balls are used as a self-medication for a wide variet y of conditions, including fever, rheumatism, apoplexy, and cataracts. Herbal balls similar to those analyzed are readily available in specialty markets throughout the United States. Mercury (probably mercury sulfide) was detected in 8 of the 9 herbal balls tested. The recommended adult dose for the herbal balls is two per day. Ingesting two herbal balls could theoretically provide a dose of up to 1,200 mg of mercury. Perh aric et al. (1994) reported poisonings resulting from exposure to traditional remedies and food supplements reported to the National Poisons Unit in London, England. From 1989 to 1991, metallic mercury was im plicated in several poisonings following exposure to Asian medicines. The issuance of informational no tices by health departments cautioning members of these subpopulation about the toxic properti es of mercury may be appropriate. Mercuric sulfide, or cinnabar, was reported to be used in tattooing dyes to produce a red pigmentation (Bagley et al. 1987; Biro and Klein 1967). An analysis of finger paints and make-up paints manufactured in Europe showed that they all contained less than 1 ppm mercury (Rastogi 1992). The author did not discuss whether these products are available in the United Stat es. While some of medicinal and pharmaceutical uses of mercury compounds have been replaced in recent y ears, individuals in some ethnic or religious groups may still use mercury in various traditional remedies, ceremonies, and rituals. Individuals that Use Mercury in Religious Ceremonies and/or Ethnic Practices or Live in Dwellings where Intentional or Unintentional Elemental Mercury Spills have Occurred. Metallic mercury has been used in Latin American and Caribbean communities as part of certain religious practices (e.g., Voodoo, Santeria, and Espiritismo) pr edominantly in domestic settings (Wendroff 1990). Metallic mercury is sold in shops ca lled botanicas (sometimes under the name azogue) which stock medicinal plants, magical medicines, incense, candles, and perfumes. Botanicas typically dispense mercury in gelatin capsules or, sometimes, in small glass vials. Some practices involve sprinkling metallic mercury on the floor of the dwelling or of a car, mixing elementa l mercury with soap and water to wash the floor, or placing it in an open container to rid the house of evil spirits. Other practices involve carrying a smallamount of mercury in a vial on the person or mixing me rcury in bath water or perfumed soaps, devotional MERCURY 475 5. POTENTIAL FOR HUMAN EXPOSURE candles, ammonia, or camphor. Any of these practices can liberate mercury vapor into the room air exposing the occupants to unnecessarily elevated levels of mercury vapors (ATSDR 1997; Wendroff 1990, 1991). The issuance of cautionary notices by health depart ments to members of these user populations may be appropriate. While some medicinal and pharmaceutical uses of mercury compounds have been replaced in recent years, individuals in some religious and ethnic groups may still use mercury in various rituals. This use of mercury can contaminate the dwelling if the mercury is not removed from flooring, carpeting, and woodwork in an appropriate manner. Individuals Living in Homes Where Mercury-containing Latex Paints Have Been Used. Prior to 1991, phenylmercuric compounds were used as biocides in 25-30% of interior and exterior latex paints; however, this use of mercury was voluntarily discontinue d for interior paint in 1990 and for exterior paint in 1991 (Hefflin et al. 1993; Reese 1990). This use of phenylmercury resulted in the exposure of house painters and residents to elemental mercury vapors in homes where interior or exterior latex paint was applied. The concentration of mercury in interior paints was less than 200 ppm; however, the atmospheric concentrations of elemental mercury vapor were found to be as high as 200 \u00b5g/m3 less than 6 hours after painting, 10 \u00b5g/m3 at 24 hours, and 6 \u00b5g/m3 after 1 month. Although the use of mercury biocides in latex paint has been discontinued, it is possible that peopl e who use old latex paint in their homes will be exposed to mercury for a considerable time (Blondell and K nott 1993). Furthermore, although phenylmercury use in exterior latex paints was discontinue d in 1991, paint companies were allowed to continue to produce and sell paint containing phenylmercury until the existing stocks of phenylmercury were exhausted. Paint produced after 1990 containing phenylmercury must be so labele d. Exterior latex pain ts may have contained phenylmercury at concentrations of up to 1,500 ppm, and their use has been shown to result in elevated mercury levels in painters (see Section 5.5) (Heff lin et al. 1993). However, each year many homeowners (66%) repaint their own homes, rather than employing professional painters; therefore, these individuals may also be exposed (Hefflin et al. 1993). In addition, consumers can mistakenly use exterior paints indoors, which may produce higher exposures to mercury than when the paints are used outdoors. Blondell and Knott (1993) estimated that approximately 13 million people could be exposed to mercury through painting, assuming the interior of houses were painted once every 5 y ears, that 78% of the interior paint used is latex, and that one-third of the interior latex paint c ontained mercury. These authors emphasize that key populations at risk include the painters, residents in the painted homes and children living in those homes. MERCURY 476 5. POTENTIAL FOR HUMAN EXPOSURE 5.8 ADEQUACY OF THE DATABASE Section 104(i)(5) of CERCLA, as amended, directs the Administrator of ATSDR (in consultation with the Administrator of EPA and agencies and programs of th e Public Health Service) to assess whether adequate information on the health effects of mercury is availa ble. Where adequate information is not available, ATSDR, in conjunction with the NTP, is required to assure the initiation of a program of research designed to determine the health effects (and techniques for deve loping methods to determine such health effects) of mercury. The following categories of possible data needs have been identified by a joint team of scientists from ATSDR, NTP, and EPA. They are defined as substan ce-specific informational needs that if met would reduce the uncertainties of human health assessment. This definition should not be interpreted to mean that all data needs discussed in this section must be fille d. In the future, the identified data needs will be evaluated and prioritized, and a substance- specific research agenda will be proposed. 5.8.1 Identification of Data Needs Physical and Chemical Properties. The physical and chemical properties of metallic mercury and its inorganic and organic compounds have been we ll characterized to permit estimation of their environmental fate (Lewis 1993; Merck Weiss 1986). Most values are available for the log Kow, log Koc, Henry's law constant, vapor pressure, and solubility in water. Experimental data exist that allow characterization of the environmental fate of metallic mercury and inor ganic and organic mercury compounds in a variety of environmental media. Production, Import/Export, Use, Release, and Disposal. Information on mercury production, import/export, and use are well documented (Blayney et al. 1997; al. 1997; USGS 1997). Information on disposal methods and recycling of mercury and mercury containing wastes are available (Carrico 1985; DOI 1989; Jasinski 1993; TRI96 1998).MERCURY 477 5. POTENTIAL FOR HUMAN EXPOSURE One area that requires additional study is the use of elemental mercury by members of specific religious or ethnic groups in their ceremonies, rituals, and practi ces so an assessment of the magnitude of these activities can be made. In addition, information on how mercur y is used in these ceremonies and rituals, as well as the methods of mercury disposal used, would be helpfu l in assessing the potential pathways for human exposure and environmental releases. According to the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act of 1986, 42 U.S.C. Section 11023, industries are required to submit chemical release and off-site transfer information to the EPA. The Toxics Release Inventory (TRI), which contains this information for 1996, became available in May 1998. This database will be updated year ly and should provide a list of industrial production facilities and emissions. Environmental Fate. Mercury released to the atmosphere may be transported long distances before being removed by wet or dry deposition. Residence time in the atmosphere has been estimated to range from 60-90 days to 0.3-2 years (EPA 1984b; Glass et al. 1991). Volatile forms of mercury released in water orsoil can enter the atmosphere, but most mercury is adsorbed to soil and sediment (EPA 1984b; Meili et al. 1991). Sorbed mercury may be reduced to elemental mercury or bioconverted to volatile organic forms (EPA 1984b). The major transport and transformati on processes involved in the environmental fate of mercury have been fairly well defined; the most im portant fate process for human exposure, bioaccumulation of methylmercury in aquatic food chains is also we ll defined (Callahan et al. 1979; EPA 1984b; Stein et al. 1996). Additional information on mercury transpor t and flux in waterbodies would be helpful. Bioavailability from Environmental Media. Metallic mercury vapors in the air are readily absorbed through the lungs following inhalation exposure, while inorganic and organic mercury compounds are poorly absorbed via this route (Berlin et al. 1969). Gastro intestinal (GI) absorption of methylmercury is nearly complete, while GI absorption of inorganic mercury is low (typically <10%) (Clarkson 1989; Friberg and Nordberg 1973). Metallic mercury be ab sorbed following dermal exposure; however, dermal absorption of the vapor accounts for a much smaller pe rcentage (2.6% of the total absorbed through the lungs) than absorption through the inhalation route (H ursh et al. 1989). Inorganic mercury salts and organomercury compounds can also be dermally absorb ed to some extent (Blayney et al. 1997; Junghaus MERCURY 478 5. POTENTIAL FOR HUMAN EXPOSURE 1983; Schamberg et al. 1918; Toribara et al. 1997). Data are needed regarding the bioavailability of elemental, inorganic, and organic mercury forms from contaminated surface water, groundwater, soil, orplant material. Data are also needed regarding the bi oavailability of mercuric chloride in air because of the possibility of inhalation of volatilized mercuric chlo ride near emission sources. Additional data on the bioavailability of elemental mercury, inorgani c mercury compounds, and organic mercury compounds (specifically, methylmercury) in soil would also be useful in assessing the risks from dermal and oral exposures at mining, industrial, or hazardous waste sites. Food Chain Bioaccumulation. Mercury is known to bioconcentrate in aquatic organisms and biomagnify in aquatic food chains (ASTER 1997; EPA 1984b; Jackson 1991; Kohler 1994; Watras and Bloom 1992). Wh ile bioconcentration in the aquatic food chain is well studied, little is known about the bioaccumulati on potential for terrestrial food chains, although it appears to be smaller than in aquatic systems (Li ndqvist 1991a). Additional information on the potential for terrestrial food chain biomagnification would be useful in light of the binding of mercury to organic matter in soils and sediment. Information on foliar uptake of mercury and of plant/mercury chemistry is needed to determine whether plants convert elemental or divalent mercury into other forms of mercury that are more readily bioaccumulated and whether plants are able to emit these different forms to the air. Additional information is also needed to improve biotransfer factors for mercury from soil to plants to animals. Exposure Levels in Environmental Media. Environmental monitoring data are available for mercury in ambient air, surface water, groundwater, drinking water, soils, sediments, and foodstuffs (EPA 1984b, 1985; Glass et al. 1990; Lindqvist 1994); however, a dditional monitoring data on mercury levels in all environmental media, particularly drinking water, would be helpful in de termining current exposure levels. Estimates of human intake from inhalation of ambient air and ingestion of contaminated foods and drinking water are available (Burger et al. 1992), although the estimates may be based on specific intakescenarios (e.g., information is most extensive for fi sh and other seafood products). Better estimates of fish consumption rates for high-end cons umers (subsistence fishers) and recreational fishers is needed, as is information on fish-specific consumption rates by th ese populations. Additional information on the levels of mercury in foods other than fish and seafood would be very useful in determining total dietary intakes. Additional research is needed to characterize mercury exposures via consumption of marine mammalspecies. Available data indicate that the ratio of me thylmercury to total mercury varies within tissues, and that only a small portion of mercury is methylated in the marine mammal's liver. Also, other trace metalconstituents of marine mammal tissues such as selenium, cadmium, and other metals may interact with andMERCURY 479 5. POTENTIAL FOR HUMAN EXPOSURE influence the bioavailability of mercury. Additiona l studies are needed in order to understand why the relatively high concentrations of mercury measured in marine mammal tissues do not appear to result in elevation of hair mercury levels among Alaskan natives that consume marine mammal tissues. Reliable monitoring data for the levels of mercury in contaminated media at hazardous waste sites are needed so that the information obtained on levels of me rcury in the environment can be used in combination with the known body burden of mercury to assess the poten tial risk of adverse health effects in populations living in the vicinity of hazardous waste sites. Exposure Levels in Humans. Mercury has been measured in human blood, hair, breast milk, urine, feces, and saliva (Bakir et al. 1973; Paradis 1995a, 1995b; WHO 1990). However, current information on mercury levels in blood, hair, breast milk, and urine of members of the general U.S. population are almost entirely lacking. Data are needed for the general popula tion that measure the levels of mercury in blood, hair, breast milk, and urine derived from dietary exposures (suc h as fish consumption) versus mercury derived from dental amalgams in order to obtain additional info rmation about the importance of each of these exposure pathways to resulting mercury body burden. Additional in formation on mercury levels in urine of persons with varying numbers of amalgam surfaces as well as in persons that have had amalgam fillings removed or replaced would be useful in evaluating mercury exposure form this source. Data are available for some Native American populations (Galster 1976) and several foreign populations that consume large amounts of locally caught fish and wildlife (Airey 1983b; Fleming et al. 1995; Lasora and Citterman 1991). The most common method of assessing human exposure in the workplace involves the measurement of mercury in urine (Baser and Marion1990; Bell et al. 1973; Lindstedt et al. 1979; Roels et al. 1987; Rosenman et al. 1986). Urine mercury levelshave been correlated with ambient air exposure leve ls, particularly to mercury vapor. A longitudinal epidemiological study that tracks individual exposure le vels to metallic mercury va pors in occupational settings (chloralkali industry workers, fluorescent lightbulb manufact urers, or other mercury utilizing industries) on a daily basis and associated these exposure levels with weekly urine and blood samples for a period of 1-2 years is needed. Neurobehavioral testing should also be c onducted of these workers at 6-month intervals. Workers new to these industries would make the best subjects since they could provide pre-exposure blood and urine levels as a point of reference. Information is ava ilable on populations living near former production sites or hazardous waste sites (Harnly et al. 1997; Nublein et al. 1995; Reif et al. 1993; Shaw et al. 1986). Additionalinformation on the biological monitoring of populations living in the vicinity of hazardous waste MERCURY 480 5. POTENTIAL FOR HUMAN EXPOSURE sites would be helpful in estimating exposure of these populations to mercury compounds. This information is useful for assessing the need to conduct health studies on these populations. Exposures of Children. Children are exposed to mercury by a variety of exposure pathways depending on their age. The most important pathways appear to be via inhalation of metallic mercury vapors, intake of inorganic mercury associated with dental amalgams in children up to 18 years old, and ingestion of methylmercury in foods primarily fish and shellfish. These are the same important pathways of exposure for adults as well. Infants can also be e xposed to mercury from mother's milk. More data are needed on the levels of mercury exposure in nur sing women from inhalation of metallic mercury in occupational or domestic situations, including religious and ethnic uses (ATSDR 1997; fro commercial arts crafts (Grabo 1997; Rastogi and Pritzi 1996); from mercury- containing and prescription drugs (Al-Saleh a nd Al-Doush 1997; Barr Perharic et al. 1994); and from consumption of mercury- contaminated fish and wildlife, including marine mammals (CRITFC 1994; Egeland et al. 1998;Oskarsson et al. 1996). Exposure and body burde n studies especially related to consumption of freshwater fish in the U.S. populations are needed to determine exposure levels, particularly in the children of recreational and subsistence fishers. Individual members of freshwater sport fish species in the Northeastern United States have been found to have tissue concentrations as high as 8.94 ppmmercury, while some species have mean tissue concentrations as high as 0.77 ppm (NESCAUM 1998). Exposure and body burden studies are also needed in Alaskan populations of subsistence hunters that consume large amounts of marine mammal tissues. Exis ting data on levels of mercury in breast milk in Alaskan women (Galster 1976) are dated and may not reflect either current levels of mercury contamination in fish and wildlife or dietary hab its of Inuit or other subsistence fishing/hunting populations. A unique exposure pathway that has received little r esearch attention is the exposure to children from religious and ethnic uses in homes and cars or in remedies containing metallic mercury (ATSDR 1997; Johnson [in press]; Wendroff 1990, 1991). In some relig ious practices of Latin American or Caribbean origin, there are traditional rituals or remedies that i nvolve mercury. These include intentional sprinkling of liquid elemental mercury on the floor, burning candles made with mercury, using mercury in baths, adding it to perfume, or wearing small containers of mercury around the neck for good luck. There is an urgent need to obtain information on the levels of exposure from th ese practices to determine if children or adults are at risk. Mercury vapor concentrations may be much higher after use during the winter months when the heat is MERCURY 481 5. POTENTIAL FOR HUMAN EXPOSURE turned on and the windows are closed, so data that re flect a variety of possible exposure scenarios are also needed. Results of the Total Diet Study conducted by the FDA sugg est that two-year-old children differ in their weight- adjusted intake of mercury, based on the assumption that 50% of the fish consumed were locally caught species (Clarkson 1990; Gunderson 1988). Additiona l information on weight adjusted intakes would be helpful for the general population, and particularly in determining the health risks for young children in Native American populations. Children in these populations may consume re latively large quantities of locally caught fish as part of their traditional ceremonial practices (CRITFC 1994) or may consume large quantities of marine mammal tissues (blubber, muscle, and organ meats) if they are in subsistence fishing or hunting populations. One childhood-specific means of decreasing exposure scen arios for children is through better education of school age children and their parents on the health ri sks particularly of metallic mercury exposure from accidental spillage, intentional uses, or from improper industrial exposures. Exposure Registries. New York State has instituted a Heavy Me tals Registry that monitors occupational exposure to heavy metals, including mercury. Cases are reported when mercury exposure is equal to or exceeds 50 \u00b5g/L (ppb) in blood or 20 \u00b5g/L (ppb) in urine. Between 1982 and 1986, 1,000 cases of mercury exposure were reported and linked to 47 companies. Most e xposures (494 cases) occurred in workers in the alkali and chlorine industry, where mercury is used as a cathode because exposure occurs when the cells are opened; the median blood mercury concentration was 76 \u00b5g/L (ppb) (maximum concentration 916 \u00b5g/L [ppb]). The second most frequent exposure category (213 cases) was the manufacture of industrial instruments, such as the manual assembly and fabrication of thermometers; me dian blood mercury concentration was 145 \u00b5g/L (ppb) and the maximum concentration was 889 \u00b5g/L (ppb) (Baser and Marion 1990). This substance is not currently one of the compounds for which a subregistry has been established in the National Exposure Registry. The substance will be consid ered in the future when chemical selection is made for subregistries to be established. The information th at is amassed in the National Exposure Registry facilitates the epidemiological research needed to assess adverse health outcomes that may be related to exposure to this substance.MERCURY 482 5. POTENTIAL FOR HUMAN EXPOSURE 5.8.2 Ongoing Studies A search of Federal Research in Progress (FEDRIP 1998) identified numerous research studies that are currently being conducted that may fill some of the data needs discussed in Section 5.8.1. Ongoing studies and long-term research concerning occupational or general population exposures to mercury and studies that address the issue of the religious and ethnic uses of elemental mercury are presented in Table 5-22..MERCURY 487 6. ANALYTICAL METHODS The purpose of this chapter is to d escribe the analytical methods that are available for detecting, and/or measuring, and/or monitoring mercury, its metabolites, and other biomarkers of exposure to and effects of mercury. The intent is not to provide an exhaustive list of analytical methods. Rather, the intention is to identify well-established methods that are used as the sta ndard methods of analysis. Many of the analytical methods used for environmental samples are the met hods approved by federal agencies and organizations such as EPA and the National Institute for Occupati onal Safety and Health (NIOSH). Other methods presented in this chapter are those that are approved by groups such as the Association of Official Analytical Chemists (AOAC) and the American Public Health A ssociation (APHA). Additionally, analytical methods are included that modify previously used methods to obtain lower detection limits, and/or to improve accuracy and precision. The analysis of metals in biological and environmenta l samples is complicated by the different organic and inorganic forms of the metal that may be present. For mercury, this complication is usually overcome by reducing all the mercury in the sample to its elemental st ate prior to analysis; this solution is not appropriate when information about the individual mercury species is desired. Mercury has an additional problem of being relatively volatile and, therefore, easily lost dur ing sample preparation and analysis. In spite of these complications, several methods have been developed for determining trace amounts of mercury in biological and environmental samples, even in complex media. Careful attention must be paid to inadvertent contamination of the sample with mercury, especially when determining trace concentrations. Labware (glass or Teflon) should be thoroughly cleaned and acid- leached before being used for trace-level analysis. It has been shown that final soaking of labor atory ware, particularly Teflon, in hot (70 EC) 1% HCL removes any traces of oxidizing compounds (e.g., chlorine) that ma y subsequently destroy methylmercury in solution (Horvat 1996). Appropriate method blanks must be included. Attention must be paid also to sample preservati on to avoid perturbing the distribution of mercury compounds in the sample (Horvat 1996). The preservati on of aqueous samples is often accomplished using acidification. However, suspended matter must be re moved prior to acidification and dimethylmercury and Hg(0) have to be removed or else conversion of these species into methylmercury and mercury(II) can occur (Horvat 1996). For solid matrices, the preservation method of choice is freezing (Bloom 1993). Freezing preserves all major mercury species indefin itely, although coagulation will occur for sediments thus making it difficult to obtain representative subsampl es of the sediment for analysis. For most metals, such storage MERCURY 488 6. ANALYTICAL METHODS issues would be solved by drying the samples first, but for mercury, especially methylmercury, there is a risk of losses from volatilization. Tissue samples may be freeze-dried without loss of methylmercury. Repeated freezing and thawing of wet, biological sam ples can also cause loss of methylmercury (Horvat and Byrne 1992) but such degradations are dependant on the matrix. Numerous standard or certified reference materials ex ist for verifying the reliability of new or modified methods, especially for total mercury; standard refe rence materials for individual organomercury species can be more difficult to obtain. The existing methods for determining mercury in biological andenvironmental matrices are described more fully in the following sections. 6.1 BIOLOGICAL MATERIALS Many researchers have attempted to determine mercur y levels in the blood, urine, tissues, and hair of humans and animals. Most methods have used atom ic absorption spectrometry (AAS), atomic fluorescence spectrometry (AFS), or neutron activation analysis (NAA). In addition, methods based on massspectrometry (MS), spectrophotometry, and anodic stripping voltametry (ASV) have also been tested. Ofthe available methods, cold vapor (CV) AAS is the most widely used. In most methods, mercury in thesample is reduced to the elemental state. Some methods require predigestion of the sample prior to reduction. At all phases of sample preparation and an alysis, the possibility of contamination from mercury found naturally in the environment must be cons idered. Rigorous standards to prevent mercury contamination must be followed. Table 6-1 presents de tails of selected methods used to determine mercury in biological samples. Methods have been developed for the analysis of mercury in breath samples. Theseare based on AAS with either flameless (NIOSH 1994) or cold vapor release of the sample to the detection chamber (Rathje et al. 1974). Flameless AAS is the NIOSH-recommended method of determining levels ofmercury in expired air (NIOSH 1994). No other cu rrent methods for analyzing breath were located. In recent years, increasing attention has been paid to human exposure to mercury via dental amalgams (Skare 1995). Exposure results from elemental merc ury vapor released from amalgams that is either inhaled directly or swallowed after dissolution in sa liva. A Jerome 511 Gold Film Mercury Vapor Analyzer (Arizona Instrument Corp., Jerome, AZ) has been u sed to measure mercury vapor released from amalgam during routine dental procedures (Engle et al. 1992) or at other times to establish baseline exposure data(Halbach 1995). Accuracy and precision data were not reported. Although the detection limit for this method was not reported, mercury concentrations at \u00b5g concentrations are detectable. A similar instrument MERCURY 492 6. ANALYTICAL METHODS (Jerome 431X Mercury Vapor Analyzer) was used by Chien et al. (1996) to measure elemental mercury vapor released from dental amalgams in the oral cavity and was reported to have a sensitivity of 0.003 mg/m3. Absorbed mercury can be measured using bl ood and urine measurements as described below. CVAAS is the primary method that is used to determine mercury in blood and serum (Friese et al. 1990; Ngim 1988, 1991). Using CVAAS, concentrations in the sub- to low-ppb can be reliably measured. Both direct reduction of sample (Friese et al. 1990; Ngim et al. 1988)and predigestion followed by reduction (Oskarsson et al. 1996; Vermeir et al. 1988, 1989) produced good accuracy and precision. However, with predigestion techniques, best results were obtained on samples that were heated in a closed teflon container in a mi crowave oven and preconcentrated on gold-coated sand (Vermeir et al. 1989). A complimentary method to CVAAS for total mercury determination in blood iselectrothermal atomic absorption (ETAAS) (Emteborg et al. 1992). Recoveries are excellent and sensitivityis 2 \u00b5g/dm 3. GC/microwave-induced plasma atomic emission detection (MPD) can also be used to measure both organic and inorganic mercury in blood samples (B ulska et al. 1992). Sensitivity is in the sub-ppb range, and recovery is excellent (100%). Methylmercury and inorganic mercury were extracted from human whole blood samples, as their diethyldithiocarbamate complexes, into toluene and but ylated them by using a Grignard Reagent (Bulska et al. 1992). The mercury species were then detected by a microwave-induced plasma atomic emission spectrometric system (GC/MPD). The absolute detection limit was calculated to be 1 pg of mercury ineither the methylmercury or inorganic mercury fo rm. This corresponds to a detection limit of about 0.4 \u00b5g/L. The method is reproducible. Methods for inorganic mercury and organic mercury (mostly methylmercury) have been reported for blood, urine, hair, and breast milk (Akagi et al. 1995; Bergdahl et al. 1995; Oskarsson et al. 1996). Total mercury is typically determined using CVAAS after complete conversion of all mercury to the volatile elementa l form using harsh (nitric acid/perchloric acid, bromate/bromide) digestions followed by reduction of ionic mercury to the elemental form. Inorganic mercury can be determined after milder digestions (H Cl, sulfuric acid) and reduction. The organic form is determined by the difference between total and inorga nic. Sub-ng/g (ppb) detection limits are routine. Methylmercury is also determined using GC with electron capture detection (ECD) (Akagi et al. 1995). There is evidence to suggest that urinary mercur y levels are good measures of exposure to inorganic mercury in the environment (Ikingura and Akagi 1996). The primary method used to analyze urine for mercury is CVAAS (Akagi et al. 1995; Friese et al. 1988; Oskarsson et al. 1996; Ping MERCURY 493 6. ANALYTICAL METHODS and Dasgupta 1989, 1990; Vesterberg 1991). Methods using et al. et al. 1990), and isotope-dilu tion spark source (IDSS) MS have also been developed. CVAAS is sensitive (low-ppt), reliable (recovery is >76% and pr ecision is generally <10% relative standard deviation [RSD]), and may be used on either digested or undigested samples (Friese et al. 1990; Ngim et al. 1988; Ping and Dasgupta 1989, 1990). Improved sensitivity (sub-ppt), accuracy (>90% recovery), and precision (7% RSD or better) we re obtained with AFS when samples were digested in a closed container in a microwave (Vermeir et al. 1991a, 1991b). Good results have also beenachieved with ASV (Liu et al. 1990) and IDSSMS (Moody and Paulsen 1988). The precision of thesemethods is especially high (<5% RSD), and recoveri es with ASV are >90%. Both these methods require predigestion of the sample. As an alternative to CVAAS, total mercury determination in blood and urine can be performed by inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectroscopy 1992; Kalamegham a nd Ash 1992). These methods are sensitive, with detection limits in the sub-ppb range. Recoveries (> 90%) and precision (<17% coefficient of variation [CV]) are good. AAS-based methods and NAA have been used to measure mercury in tissues. The AAS methods differ in the way the sample is released for detection. C VAAS is the best-defined of the AAS techniques. Mercury concentrations in the sub- to low-ppb have been reliably determined in tissue samples (Friese et al. 1990; Vermeir et al. 1988, 1989). Best results were obtained when the sample was digested in a closed container in a microwave oven, and the vaporized mercury was preconcentrated on gold-coated sand (Vermeir et al. 1989). Flameless AAS, which uses an el ectric furnace to atomize the mercury, has yielded high recoveries, but no data are available on the sen sitivity or precision of the technique (Ichinose and Miyazawa 1989). Separative column atomizer AAS (SCA-AAS) introduces the mercury to the detector by running the sample through a heat-activated charco al column (Yanagisawa et al. 1989). Little sample preparation is required, but high background interference is a problem with this method. Good results were reported for tissue samples with sub-ppm mercur y concentrations (from control rats), but decreased accuracy and precision occurred in samples containing hi gher levels (from dosed rats). AFS offers a good alternative to CVAAS. Sensitivity was in the sub- ppt range, and recovery a nd precision were excellent (Vermeir et al. 1991a, 1991b). In addition, sample pr eparation is relatively simple and rapid. NAA permits determination of mercury in tissue samples at the sub- to low-ppb level, but erratic accuracy and precision make the method less reliable (Taskaev et al. 1988; Zhuang et al. 1989). An extraction methodusing zinc diethyldithiocarbamate produced good r esults with NAA (Zhuang et al. 1989). GC equipped with a flame ionization detector (FID) has also been used to detect methylmercury in tissues at ng levels (Baldi and Filippelli 1991). Recovery and precision data were not reported.MERCURY 494 6. ANALYTICAL METHODS Studies have indicated that the mercury concentrati on in the hair correlates well with dietary mercury exposure (Inasmasu et al. 1986; Wilhelm and Idel 1996). Methylmercury is the primary dietary mercury contaminant and is present in large amounts in seafood (Ikingura and Akagi 1996). Most of the mercurymeasured in hair is methylmercury; hair is a good matrix for assessing exposure to methylmercury (Wilhelm and Idel 1996). Hair analysis has been conducted using CVAAS, AFS, and NAA (Grandjean et Pineau et al. 1990; Suo et al. 1992; Suzuki et al. 1992; Taskaev et al. 1988;Vermeir et al. 1991a, 1991b; Zhuang et al. 1989). Segmental hair analysis is commonly used as a meansof determining an historical record of exposure or uptake of mercury (Grandjean et al. 1992; Suzuki et al. 1992). The method involves cutting the hair strands into smaller segments, usually 1 cm each, andanalyzing each segment separately. Detection limits for hair using CVAAS were not reported but are expected to be similar to those for tissue (sub- to low-ppb). The sensitivity of NAA is similar to that of CVAAS, but variable recoveries and precision make NAA less reliable. Good results were reported for one NAA method (Zhuang et al. 1989). Results from st udies using AFS suggest this method may be the most sensitive and reliable technique (Suo et al. 1992; Vermeir et al. 1991a, 1991b). A detection limit in the sub-ppt range was obtained, and preci sion and accuracy were both excellent. An X-ray fluorescence (XRF) technique has been used to measure mercury in the wrist and temporal areas of dentists exposed to various heavy metals in the work place (Bloch and Shapiro 1986). This technique allows simultaneous evaluation of the ti ssue burden of a number of different metals. Bone levels may be more closely related to long-term e xposure than levels in blood, urine, and hair. The detection limit for XRF is in the low ppm. A method for detecting methylmercury in biological samples by its enzymatic conversion to methane is an alternative biological technique for methylmercury or other organomercurial analyses (Baldi andFilippelli 1991). Pseudomonas putida strain FB1, a spectrum mercury-resistant strain, is able to enzymatically convert methylmercury to Hg 0 and methane either in whole cell or in cell-free extracts. GC/FID was used to determine methane produced by th e biological derivatization of methylmercury. The detection limit was 15 ng of methylmercury extracted from 1 g of biological tissue. The coefficient ofvariation was 1.9%. Chemical interferences are neg ligible in the enzymatic determination of methyl- mercury. The specificity of this determination places the method among the most reliable ones. Recovery was not reported.MERCURY 495 6. ANALYTICAL METHODS 6.2 ENVIRONMENTAL SAMPLES Mercury levels have been determin ed in numerous environmental matrices, including air, water (surface water, drinking water, groundwater, sea water, and i ndustrial effluents), soils and sediments, fish and shellfish, foods, pharmaceuticals, and pesticides. Th e sample preparation varies with the complexity of the matrix, but most complex samples require decomposition of the matrix and reduction of the mercury to its elemental form. As described Section 6. 1 for biological samples, special sample preparation methods need to be employed if inorganic and organic mercury are to be determined separately, or if the individual species of the organic mercury fraction are to be determined. More detailed information on selected methods in various environmental samples is given in Table 6-2. Both CVAAS and CVAFS have been used to monitor air and suspended particulates in air for mercury (Baeyens and Leermakers et al. 1991; Temmerman et al. 1990). Both methods are sensitive, accurate, and precise, although slightly greater sensitivity was reported with AFS (low ppt) than with AAS (mid ppt); AFS is becoming a more common method of analysis (Horvat 1996). When AAS or AFS was combined with gas chromatography (GC), the different mercury species (inorganicmercury, dimethylmercury, diethylmercury, and methylmercury chloride) present in the air beseparated (Bloom and Fitzgerald 1988; Paudyn and Van Loon 1986). A colorimetric method, based on the formation of a colored complex formed in the presence of mercury, has been used as a quick and simple field test that can detect mercury present at the mid-ppb level (Cherian and Gupta 1990). Numerous methods, including CVAAS, ASV, inductively coupled plasma (ICP) MS, ICP to determine mercury levels in aqueous medi a. Mercury has been measured in drinking water, surface water, groundwater, snow, waste water efflue nts, and sea water. Of the available methods, CVAAS is the method of choice (Baxter and Frech 1989, 1990; Birnie 1988; Eaton et al. 1995; Gotoet et al. 1989; Mateo et Munaf et al. Schintu et al. 1989; Shkinev et al. 1989) and the method recommended by EPA and AOAC (AOAC 1984; Beckert et al. 1990; EPA 1994f, 1994g). This method is very sensitive for mercury in wa ter (sub- to low-ppt) and has been proven to be reliable. Water samples generally do not require digestion, but mercury in the samples is usually reduced to the elemental state and preconcentr ated prior to analysis. When combined MERCURY 503 6. ANALYTICAL METHODS with GC, CVAAS has been used to separate and determine individual mercury species in aqueous samples (Paudyn and Van Loon 1986). Spectrophotometry has often been used to determine mercury inaqueous matrices (Abbas et al. 1989; Ajmal et et al. 1995; Raman and Shinde 1990; Singh et al. 1989). Sample preparation methods vary and have included separation by thin-layer chromatography (TLC) (Ajmal et al. 1989) or column chromatography (Yan et al. 1989), selectiveextraction (Abbas et al. 1989), and ligand formation (Raman and Shinde 1990; Singh et al. 1989). While recoveries were good, spectrophotometry is not as sensitive a technique as CVAAS. Tests of additionalmethods, including ASV (Liu et al. 1990), ICP/MS (Haraldsson et al. 1989), Nakahara based techniques (Evans and McKee 1988; Shofst ahl and Hardy 1990), and graphite-furnace (GF) AAS (LeBihan and Cabon 1990) indicate that these methods may also be useful for determining mercury inwater samples. One of the most promising methods is GC/AFS, which has the advantages of increasedsensitivity and precision compared to CVAAS and can al so be used to isolate individual mercury species (Bloom 1989). A colorimetric assay has also been developed that is useful for rapid preliminaryscreening of field samples (Cherian and Gupta 1990). CVAAS is the most commonly used technique for de termining the mercury concentration of sediments, soils, and sludge (Bandyopadhyay and Das 1989; B eckert et al. 1990; EPA 1994g; Van Delft and Vos 1988). As with other matrices, it is sensitive, re liable, and requires little sample preparation beyond digestion of the matrix and reduction of the mercury to its elemental form. It is the method recommended by EPA for solid matrices (Beckert et al. 1990; EPA 1994g). A method based on CVAFS that uses flowinjection analysis with on-line microwave digesti on for the determination of total mercury has been described recently (Morales-Rubio et al. 1995). Good sensitivity (90 ppt) and precision (4% RSD) wasdemonstrated. Gas chromatography in conjunction with atomic emission detection (GC/AED) has been used to determine organomercury species in soils a nd sediments (Liu et al. 1994). Direct current ASV (DCASV) has been tested for use in determining merc ury levels in river sediment (Lexa and Stulik 1989). The accuracy and sensitivity of this method are good, but it is less precise than CVAAS. A field methodusing XRF has been developed to monitor soil contam ination (Grupp et al. 1989). This method is rapid and portable, but its high detection limit (low- ppm) makes it useful only for on-site screening. Methods have been developed for th e determination of mercury in fish , shellfish, foods, food sources, and pharmaceuticals. AAS, usually with cold vapor gene ration (CVAAS), is one of the primary methods used to measure mercury in these complex matrices (Carrillo et al. 1986; Friese et al. 1990; Landi et al. 1990;MERCURY METHODS Navarro et al. 1992; Odukoya 1990; Vermeir et al. 1988, 1989), because of its sensitivity and reliability. Although the sensitivity (sub- to low-ppb), accuracy, and precision are not as good as with less complexgaseous and aqueous media, it is still one of the best methods available for analysis of mercury in any matrix. Flameless AAS without cold vapor genera tion has also produced good results when used to determine ppb levels of mercury in wine (Cacho a nd Castells 1989) and fish (Filippelli 1987); it is also one of the methods recommended by AOAC for fish and food (AOAC 1984). When combined with high resolution GC (HRGC), the individual organic mercury species in fish could be determined (Jiang et al. 1989). Sub-ppt levels of mercury in powdered milk and oyster tissue we re reliably determined using AFS (Vermeir et al. 1991a, 1991b). NAA was used easure mercury levels in copepod homogenate and tomato leaves, but the sensitivity (mid- to low-ppb) and reliability were not as good as that of CVAAS or AFS (Taskaev et al. 1988; Zhuang et al. 1989). Se veral other methods, including IDSSMS (Moody and and spectrophotometry (Agrawal and D esai 1985; Marquez et al. 1988) have also been used to analyze fish, plant material, and pharmaceuti cals for mercury. HPLC/ICP/MS has the additional advantage of permitting separation and quantitation of individual mercury species (Bushee 1988). An AOAC-recommended colorimetric method is available for screening food samples (AOAC 1984). Several other environmental matrices have been analy zed for mercury content. These include coal fly ash (Horvat and Lupsina 1991; Lexa and Stulik 1989), coal dust nkhade and Garg 1989), minerals (Bichler 1991), pesticides (Sharma and Singh 1989), g asoline (Costanzo and Barry 1988), and oily waste (Campbell and Kanert 1992). The methods used include CVAAS, DCASV, NAA, spectrophotometry,and GC/alternating current plasma detection (ACPD) . The data on each method for each matrix were insufficient for making comparisons. 6.3 ADEQUACY OF THE DATABASE Section 104(i)(5) of CERCLA, as amended, directs the Administrator of ATSDR (in consultation with the Administrator of EPA and agencies and programs of the Public Health Service) to assess whether adequate information on the health effects of mercur y is available. Where adequate information is not available, ATSDR, in conjunction with the NTP, is required to assure the initiation of a program of research designed to determine the health effects (and techniques for developing methods to determine such health effects) of mercury.MERCURY 505 6. ANALYTICAL METHODS The following categories of possible data needs have been identified by a joint team of scientists from ATSDR, NTP, and EPA. They are defined as substan ce-specific informational needs that if met would reduce the uncertainties of human health assessment. This definition should not be interpreted to mean that all data needs discussed in this section must be f illed. In the future, the identified data needs will be evaluated and prioritized, and a substance- specific research agenda will be proposed. 6.3.1 Identification of Data Needs Methods for Determining Biomarkers of Exposure and Effect. There are reliable methods for detecting and quantifying elemental mercury in hum an breath, blood, urine, milk, tissues, hair, and bones. The method of choice is CVAAS (Akagi et al. 1995; et al. 1988, 1989; Vesterberg 1991). Other methods that have produced good results include ET AAS (Emteborg et al. 1992), AFS (Corns et al. 1994; Vermeir et al. 1991a, al. AAS (NIOSH 1994), IDSSMS (Moody andPaulsen 1988), XRF (Bloch and Shapiro 1986), NAA (Fung et al. 1995; Zhuang et al. 1989), GC/MPD(Bulska et al. 1992), ICP-AES (Buneaux et al. 1992) , and ICP-MS (Kalamegham and Ash 1992). Using these methods, mercury levels at \u00b5g to pg concentrati ons are detectable. This makes them useful for measuring background and higher levels (Ikingura a nd Agaki 1996). Many of the methods can also distinguish between organic and inorganic mercury. No further methods for analysis of elemental mercury in biological fluids and tissues are needed. Additional research will be needed to validate the determination of individual mercury species (i.e., meth ylmercury, phenyl mercury, mercury acetate, etc.) in matrices determined to be important. Methods exist for the separation and detection of these species, but few standard reference materials exist for comparative studies. Biochemical indicators of possible renal dysfunction (increased urinary NAG levels, and elevated porphyrins) have been associated with increased urinar y levels of mercury (Rosenman et al. 1986; Wada et al. 1969; Woods 1996). Functional indicators of adve rse neurological effects (reduced nerve conduction velocity, prolonged nerve latency, increased tremor frequency, increased reaction time, reduced hand-eye coordination, and performance on memory and verbal intelligence tests) have also been correlated with increased urinary levels of mercury (Levine et al. 1982; Piikivi et al. 1984; Smith et al. 1970, 1983; Verberket al. 1986; Vroom and Greer 1972; Williamson et al. 1982). Decreased nerve conduction velocity has been correlated with increased tissue levels of mercury (Sha piro et al. 1982). These biomarkers are not specific for mercury and may be induced by exposure to other metals and chemicals or to disease conditions. Other MERCURY 506 6. ANALYTICAL METHODS nonspecific indicators of possible mercury exposure (insomnia, emotional instability, paresthesia, and abnormal EEG) that have been observed in exposed individuals cannot be quantified, but an increased incidence in specific populations may be correlated with increased urinary levels of mercury in the population (Davis et al. 1974; Jaffe et al. 1983; Mc Farland and Reigel 1978). The existing analytical methods that have been discussed for exposure can relia bly measure the levels in blood, urine, and tissue at which these effects occur. Standard methods exist to m easure the effects that can be quantified. No further methods need to be developed. Methods for Determining Parent Compounds and Degradation Products in Environmental Media. There are analytical methods to detect and measure elemental and organic mercury in air, water, sediment, soil, sludge, foods, plant materials, and othe r environmental matrices. The methods used include CVAAS (the most commonly used and recommended method) (AOAC 1984; and several other methods . Several of the methods have been proven reliable and are sensitive enough to measure background leve ls. Methods also exist to determine individual mercury species (Bloom and Fitzgerald 1988; Liu et al. 1994; Paudyn and Van Loon 1986). No further methods are needed for mercury analysis in environm ental samples. Additional work would be required to validate methods for individual organomercury species in particular matrices. 6.3.2 Ongoing Studies Ongoing studies concerning the detection and measureme nt of mercury in biological or environmental samples identified through a search of Federal Research in Progress (FEDRIP 1998) are shown inTable 6-3..MERCURY 509 7. REGULATIONS AND ADVISORIES The international, national, and state regulations and guidelines regarding me rcury and mercury compounds in air, water, and other media are summarized in Tabl e 7-1. Unless otherwise indicated, the listings in the table refer to mercury. An MRL of 0.0002 mg/m3 has been derived for chronic-duration inhalation exposure (365 days or more) to metallic mercury vapor in a group of 26 mercury-expo sed workers from three industries exposed to low levels of mercury for an average of 15.3 years (range, 1-41 years) (Fawer et al. 1983).An MRL of 0.007 mg mercury/kg/day has been derived fo r acute-duration oral exposure (14 days or less) to inorganic mercury based on a NOAEL of 0.93 mg mercury/kg for renal effects (increased absolute and relative kidney weights) in rats exposed to gavage doses of mercuric chloride for 14 days (NTP 1993). An MRL of mg mercury/kg/day has been de rived for intermediate-duration (15-364 days) oral exposure to inorganic mercury based on a NOAEL of 0.23 mg mercury/kg for renal effects (increased absolute and relative kidney weights) in rats (Dieter et al. 1992; NTP 1993). An MRL of 0.0003 mg mercury/kg/day has been deri ved for chronic-duration (365 days or more) oral exposure to methylmercury, based on neurodevelopmenta l outcomes in a study by Davidson et al. (1998) of children exposed in utero to methylmercury from maternal fish ingestion. EPA has derived an oral RfD of 8\u00d710 -5 mg/kg/day (0.08 \u00b5g/kg/day) for phenylmercuric acetate as mercury (IRIS 1997). The RfD is based on a LOAEL of 0. 5 ppm mercury or 0.042 mg/kg/day phenyl mercuric acetate for detectable kidney damage in female rats after 2 years (Fitzhugh et al. 1950). EPA has derived an oral RfD of 3\u00d710-4 mg/kg/day (0.3 \u00b5g/kg/day) for 0.633 mg/kg/day of mercuric chlo ride. Although no one study was found adequate for deriving an oral RfD, EPA's mercury workgroup derived an oral RfD of high confidence using the weight of evidence from three studies (Andres 1984; Bernaudin et al.; Druet et al. 1978) which used Brown-Norway rats, and an intensive review and discussion of the entire inorganic mercury data base (IRIS 1997). EPA has derived an oral RfD of 1\u00d710-4 mg/kg/day (0.1 \u00b5g/kg/day) for methylmercury based on developmental neurological abnormalities in human infants (IRIS 1997). EPA has not derived an RfD value for elementalmercury. The EPA inhalation reference con centration (RfC) for elemental mercury is 3x10 -4 mg/m3 MERCURY 510 7. REGULATIONS AND ADVISORIES (0.3 \u00b5g/m3). The RfC is based on a LOAEL of 0.025 ppm for human occupational exposure studies. Critical effects seen during these studies included hand tremors, increases in memory disturbances, and slight subjective and objective evidence of autonomic dysfunction (IRIS 1997). No RfC was reported for other mercury compounds. The American Conference of Governmental Industria l Hygienists (ACGIH) and the EPA have determined that inorganic forms of mercury, including metallic mercury, are not classifiable as to their human carcinogenicity. These agencies have assigned merc ury and its inorganic compounds the weight-of- evidence classifications of A4 and D, respectively (ACGIH 1996; IRIS 1997). EPA's weight-of ev idence classification of C, which indicates that they are possible human carcinogens (IRIS 1997). OSHA requires employers of workers who could be occupationally exposed to mercury to institute engineering controls and work practices which ensure that during any part of the workday, mercury concentrations do not exceed the ceiling value of 1 mg/10 m3 (0.1 mg/m3) have been designated as hazar dous substances pursuant to the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liab ility Act (CERCLA) of 1980 (EPA 1995i). Mercuric acetate, mercuric chloride, and mercuric oxide are mercury compounds that have been individually designated as extremely hazardous substances under S ection 313 of Title III of the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act (SARA) of 1986 (EPA 1995j ). Phenylmercury acetate is consider both a hazardous substance and an extremely hazardous subs tances. The statutory sources designating mercury and regulated mercury compounds as CERCLA hazardous substances are section 307(a) of the Clean Water Act (CWA), section 112 of the Clean Air Act (CAA) , and section 3001 of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) (EPA 1995i). The owner and operator of facilities using these substance on their sites are required to immediately report releases to an y environmental media, if the amount released exceeds the established \"reportable quantity\" (EPA 1995i). The statutory and final reportable quantities for mercury and regulated mercury compounds as established by S ection 102 of CERCLA are given in Table 7-1 (EPA 1995i). Although mercury compounds are listed generically as CERCLA hazardous substances no reportable quantity has been established for them as a broad class (EPA 1995i). Title III of SARA is also known as \"The Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (EPCRA) of 1986.\" As chemicals subject to the emergency planning and release reporting requirements of EPCRA, owners and operators of MERCURY 511 7. REGULATIONS AND ADVISORIES facilities that have mercuric acetate, mercuric chlo ride, and mercuric oxide on their sites in amounts exceeding the \"threshold planning quantity\" established for these substances must develop a program that addresses implementing emergency response plans and for notifying the public of accidental releases (EPA1987a, 1995j). When extremely hazardous substances are formulated as a solids they are subject to either of two threshold planning quantities (EPA 1995j). If th e solid exits in powdered form and has a particle size less than 100 microns, it is subject to the lower num ber. If the solid does not meet this criteria, it is subject to the higher number. The threshold planni ng quantities for mercuric acetate, mercuric chloride, mercuric oxide, and phenylmercury acetate are given in Ta ble 7-1. It is important to note that reportable quantities for these compounds are the same as their threshold planning quantities. The EPA regulates mercury under the Clean Air Act (CAA) and has designated it as a hazardous air pollutant (HAP). Emission standards for release of me rcury to the atmosphere have been promulgated for mercury cell chloralkali plants, mercury ore processing facilities, major stationary sources, and municipal waste combustors (EPA 1975a, 1975b, 1995a, 1996b). In accordance with the authority of the Safe Dr inking Water Act (SDWA), EPA has established a safe drinking water standard for mercury at 2 \u00b5g/L (FSTRAC 1995). Under the Clean Water Act (CWA) EPA provides criterion concentrations for mercury as a priority toxic pollutant (EPA 1992). Mercury is regulated as a \"priority pollutant\" in acco rdance with the Clean Water Act (CWA). The CWA establishes the basic structure for regulating the disch arge of pollutants to waterways and is designed to ensure that all waters are sufficiently clean to protect public health and/or the environment. However, if waters and their sediments become contaminat ed from sources such as atmospheric deposition and discharges from industrial, municipal, or agricultural operations, toxic substances could concentrate in the tissue of fish and wildlife. Advisories have been developed and issued to wa rn people about the health risks of consuming methylmercury-contaminated fish, shellfish, or wild life and provide guidance as to the amount of fish or wildlife that can be safely consumed by each group (adults, pregnant women, nursing mothers, and young children). Each state, Native American tribe, or U. S. Territory establishes its own criteria for issuing fish and wildlife advisories. A fish or wildlife advisory will specify which waters (lake, rivers, estuaries, or coastal areas) or hunting areas have restrictions. Th e advisory provides information on the species and size range of the fish or wildlife of concern. The a dvisory may completely ban eating fish, shellfish, orMERCURY 512 7. REGULATIONS AND ADVISORIES freshwater turtles, or it may recommend consumption limits (numbers of fish meals per specified time period) considered to be safe to eat. For example, an advisory may recommend that a person eat a certain type of fish no more than once a month. Advisories may specify the tissues of the fish or wildlife that can be safely eaten or proper preparation and cooking pr actices to help decrease exposure to methylmercury. The fish or wildlife advisory is typically more restrictive to protect pregnant women, nursing mothers, andyoung children. To reduce children's exposure to meth ylmercury, state advisory recommendations for fish consumption limits (meals per week or meals per m onth) should be strictly observed. Published information in the form of brochures on fish and wild life advisories is available from State Public Health Departments, Natural Resources Departments, or Fish and Game Departments. Signs may be posted in certain fishing and hunting areas frequently used by recreational fishers and hunters to warn them about specific contamination problems (EPA 1995 Fish Sampling analysis and Guidance Document). Currently, 1,782 advisories are in effect in 41 states and one U.S. Territory (American Samoa) restricting the consumption of mercury-contaminated fish, she llfish, or wildlife (freshwater turtles) (EPA 1998a). Methylmercury is the chemical pollutant responsible, in part, for over 77% of fish advisories issued in the United States (EPA 1998b). Eleven states (Connectic ut, Indiana, Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, Missouri, New Hampshire, New Jersey, North Carolin a, Ohio, and Vermont) currently have state-wide mercury advisories recommending that all residents rest rict consumption of locally caught freshwater fish. In addition, 5 states (Alabama, Florida, Louisiana, Massachusetts, and Texas) have issued statewide coastal mercury advisories for specific marine fish or shellf ish species. In two states (Arizona and Minnesota), wildlife advisories have been issued recommending that residents restrict their consumption of freshwater turtles (EPA 1998a, 1998b). The FDA currently has advice for consumers (posted on the Internet) recommending that pregnant women, and women of childbearing age who may become pregna nt, limit their consumption of shark and swordfish to no more that one meal per month (FDA 1998). Methylmercury levels are much higher in these fishspecies than in the more commonly consumed species. The FDA advisory covers women of childbearing age who might become pregnant because dietary prac tices immediately before the pregnancy may have a direct bearing on fetal exposure dur ing pregnancy. The FDA states that nursing mothers who follow this advice, will not expose their infants to increased h ealth risks from methylmercury (FDA 1998). The FDA consumer advice hotline telephone number is 1-800-332-4010 and the FDA Web site is www.FDA.gov .MERCURY 513 7. REGULATIONS AND ADVISORIES The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulates the use of mercury compounds in the cosmetics industry. The FDA regulations on the use of mercur y compounds in cosmetics state that \"because of the known hazards of mercury, its questionable efficacy as a skin-bleaching agent, and the availability of effective and less toxic non-mercurial preservatives, there is no justification for the use of mercury in skin- bleaching preparations or its use as a preservative in cosmetics, with the exception of eye-area cosmetics\" (FDA 1974). The use of mercury compounds as cosmetic i ngredients has primarily been limited to their use as preservatives in eye area cosmetics for which no other effective and safe non-mercurial preservative isavailable. In other preparations they must contain no more than trace amounts of mercury that areunavoidable under the conditions of good manufact uring practices (FDA 1974). The mercurial concentration in these other preparations must m easure less than 1 ppm or 0.0001% mercury metal (FDA 1974). The FDA has also established an action level of 1 ppm for methylmercury in fish (FDA 1994, 1996). Because of reports that swordfish, shark and other la rge predatory fish may contain methylmercury levels which exceed the FDA 1 ppm limit, the agency's advi ce to consumers warns pregnant women and women of childbearing age to limit their consumption of shar k and swordfish to no more than one meal a month (FDA 1996). For others, the agency recommends that regular consumption of fish species withmethylmercury levels around 1 ppm be limited to appr oximately 7 ounces per week; for fish with levels averaging 0.5 ppm, the limit is about 14 ounces per week (FDA 1996). The consumption advice isconsidered unnecessary for the top 10 species of fish that make up approximately 80% of the seafoodmarket (FDA 1996). Canned tuna, shrimp, pollock, salmon, cod, catfish, clams, flatfish, crabs, and scallopsare the top 10 species of fish consumed (FDA 1996). Since methylmercury levels in these species are usually less than 0.2 ppm and because few people eat more than the suggested weekly limit of 2.2 pounds (1kilogram) for this contamination level, cons umption limits are considered unnecessary (FDA 1996). On May 28, 1998, the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) issued a guidance statement recommending that manufacturers of liquid-filled consumer products eliminate the use of hazardouschemicals in the liquid portion of their products (CPSC 1998). The guidance statement was issued as aneffort to reduce the risk of exposing young children to hazardous chemicals contained in the liquid. The hazardous chemicals found in the liquid include mercury, ethylene glycol, diethylene Children's products identified by the Commission as containing these hazardous chemicals incl ude rolling balls, maze toys, bubble watches, and necklaces. Paperweights, keychains, liquid timers, and pens were household ite ms identified as containingMERCURY 514 7. REGULATIONS AND ADVISORIES mercury or other hazardous chemicals (CPSC 1998). In addition to the recommendation that manufacturers eliminate the use of hazardous chemicals in these products, the Commission also recommends that importers, distributors, and retailers who purchase a liquid-filled product for resale, obtain from the manufacturer assurances that their product does not contain hazardous liquid chemicals. Although theguidance is not a rule, it focuses on certain obligations authorized by the Federal Hazardous Substance Act (FHSA). Under the FHSA toys or other articles that contain an accessible and harmful amount ofhazardous chemical and are intended for use by ch ildren are banned (CPSC 1998). Articles that are not intended for use by children, but create a risk of in jury because they contain hazardous chemicals, require precautionary labeling under the FHSA (CPSC 1998). In 1995, the CPSC assisted in facilitating the recall of necklaces bearing small vials or glass balls containing metal mercury (CPSC 1995). Although the vials and glass balls posed no immediate health threat, the recall noted that exposure to mercury vapor could cause long term health problems, especially for small children and pregnant women, if th e vials or balls were broken (CPSC Determination of traces direct 22(11-12):2575-2585. al. 1969.

These models advance the importance of physiol ogically based models in that they clearly describe the biological effect (response) produced by the sy stem following exposure to an exogenous substance. Physiologically Based Pharmacokinetic (PBPK) Model \u2014is comprised of a series of compartments representing organs or tissue groups with realistic wei ghts and blood flows. These models require a variety of physiological information: tissue volumes, blood flow rates to tissues, cardiac output, alveolarventilation rates and, possibly membrane permeabilities. The models also utilize biochemical information 4such as air/blood partition coefficients, and metabo lic parameters. PBPK models are also called biologically based tissue dosimetry models. Prevalence \u2014The number of cases of a disease or condition in a population at one point in time. Prospective Study-- a type of cohort study in which the pertinent observations are made on events occurring after the start of the study. A group is followed over time. q 1*\u2014The upper-bound estimate of the low-dose slope of the dose-response curve as determined by the multistage procedure. The q1* can be used to calculate an estimate of carcinogenic potency, the incremental excess cancer risk per unit of exposure (usu ally \u00b5g/L for water, mg/kg/day for food, and \u00b5g/m3 for air). Recommended Exposure Limit (REL) \u2014A National Institute for O ccupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) time-weighted average (TWA) concentra tions for up to a 10-hour workday during a 40-hour workweek. Reference Concentration (RfC)\u2014 An estimate (with uncertainty spanning perhaps an order of magnitude) of a continuous inhalation exposure to the human popul ation (including sensitive subgroups) that is likely to be without an appreciable risk of deleterious non cancer health effects during a lifetime. The inhalation reference concentration is for c ontinuous inhalation exposures and is appropriately expressed in units of mg/m3 or ppm. Reference Dose (RfD)\u2014 An estimate (with uncertainty spanning perhaps an order of magnitude) of the daily exposure of the human population to a potential hazar d that is likely to be without risk of deleterious effects during a lifetime. The RfD is operationally derived from the No-Observed-Adverse-Effect Level (NOAEL- from animal and human studies) by a consiste nt application of uncertainty factors that reflect various types of data used to estimate RfDs and an additional modifying factor, which is based on a professional judgment of the entire database on the chemi cal. The RfDs are not applicable to nonthreshold effects such as cancer. Reportable Quantity (RQ)\u2014 The quantity of a hazardous substance th at is considered reportable under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensa tion, and Liability Act (CERCLA). Reportable quantities are (1) 1 pound or greater or (2) for selected substances, an amount established by regulationeither under CERCLA or under Section 311 of the Clean Water Act. Quantities are measured over a24-hour period.MERCURY 616 9. GLOSSARY Reproductive Toxicity\u2014 The occurrence of adverse effects on the reproductive system that may result from exposure to a chemical. The toxicity may be di rected to the reproductive organs and/or the related endocrine system. The manifestation of such toxic ity may be noted as alterations in sexual behavior, fertility, pregnancy outcomes, or modifications in other functions that are dependent on the integrity of this system. Retrospective Study\u2014 A type of cohort study based on a group of persons known to have been exposed at some time in the past. Data are collected from r outinely recorded events, up to the time the study is undertaken. Retrospective studies are limited to casual factors that can be ascertained from existing records and/or examining survivors of the cohort. Risk \u2014the possibility or chance that some adverse eff ect will result from a given exposure to a chemical. Risk Factor \u2014An aspect of personal behavior or lifestyle, an environmental exposure, or an inborn or inherited characteristic, that is associated with an increased occurrence of disease or other health-related event or condition. Risk Ratio \u2014The ratio of the risk among persons with speci fic risk factors compared to the risk among persons without risk factors. A risk ratio greater than 1 indicates greater risk of disease in the exposed group compared to the unexposed. Short-Term Exposure Limit (STEL)\u2014 The American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH) maximum concentration to which workers can be exposed for up to 15 min continually. No more than four excursions are allowed per day, and there must be at least 60 min between exposure periods. The daily Threshold Limit Value - Time Weighted Average (TLV-TWA) may not be exceeded. Target Organ Toxicity\u2014 This term covers a broad range of adverse effects on target organs or physiological systems (e.g., renal, cardiovascular) extending from those arising through a single limitedexposure to those assumed over a lifetime of exposure to a chemical. Teratogen\u2014 A chemical that causes structural defects that affect the development of an organism. Threshold Limit Value (TLV)\u2014 An American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH) concentration of a substance to which most workers can be exposed without adverse effect. The TLV may be expressed as a Time Weighted Average (TWA), as a Short-Term Exposure Limit (STEL), oras a ceiling limit (CL). Time-Weighted Average (TWA)\u2014 An allowable exposure concentration averaged over a normal 8-hour workday or 40-hour workweek. Toxic Dose (50) (TD50)\u2014A calculated dose of a chemical, introduced by a route other than inhalation, which is expected to cause a specific toxic effect in 50% of a defined experimental animal population. Toxicokinetic \u2014The study of the absorption, distribution and elimination of toxic compounds in the living organism.MERCURY 617 9. GLOSSARY Uncertainty Factor (UF) \u2014A factor used in operationally deriving the Minimal Risk Level (MRL) or Reference Dose (RfD) or Reference Concentration (R fC) from experimental data. UFs are intended to account for (1) the variation in sensitivity among the members of the human population, (2) the uncertainty in extrapolating animal data to the case of human, (3) the uncertainty in extrapolating from data obtained in a study that is of less than lifetime exposure, and (4) the uncertainty in using Lowest-Observed-Adverse- Effect Level (LOAEL) data rather than No-Observed- Adverse-Effect Level (NOAEL) data. A default for each individual UF is 10; if complete certainty in data exists, a value of one can be used; however a reduced UF of three may be used on a case-by-case basis, thr ee being the approximate logarithmic average of 10 and 1. Xenobiotic \u2014any chemical that is foreign to the biological system..MERCURY A-1 APPENDIX A ATSDR MINIMAL RISK LEVEL AND WORKSHEETS The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA) [42 U.S.C. 9601 et seq.], as amended by the Amendmen ts and Reauthorization Act (SARA) [Pub. L. 99-499], requires that the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) develop jointly with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), in order of priority, a list of hazardous substances most commonly found at facilities on the CERCLA National Priorities List (NPL); prepare toxicologicalprofiles for each substance included on the priority lis t of hazardous substances; and assure the initiation of a research program to fill identified data needs associated with the substances. The toxicological profiles include an examination, summary, and interpretation of available toxicological information and epidemiologic evaluations of a hazardous substance. During the development of toxicological profiles, Minimal Risk Levels (MRLs) are derived when reliable and sufficient data exist to identify the target organ(s) of effect or the most sen sitive health effect(s) for a specific duration for a given route of exposure. An MRL is an estimate of the daily human exposure to a hazardous substance that is likely to be without appreciable risk of adverse noncancer health effects over a specified duration of exposure. MRLs are based on noncancer health effect s only and are not based on a consideration of cancer effects. These substance-specific estimates, which ar e intended to serve as screening levels, are used by ATSDR health assessors to identify contaminants and pot ential health effects that may be of concern at hazardous waste sites. It is important to note that MRLs are not intended to define clean-up or action levels. MRLs are derived for hazardous substances using the no-observed-adverse-effect level/uncertainty factor approach. They are below levels that might cause a dverse health effects in the people most sensitive to such chemical-induced effects. MRLs are derived for acute (1-14 days), intermediate (15-364 days), and chronic (365 days and longer) durations and for the or al and inhalation routes of exposure. Currently, MRLs for the dermal route of exposure are not derived because ATSDR has not yet identified a methodsuitable for this route of exposure. MRLs are gene rally based on the most sen sitive chemical-induced end point considered to be of relevance to humans. Seri ous health effects (such as irreparable damage to the liver or kidneys, or birth defects) are not used as a basis for establishing MRLs. Exposure to a level above the MRL does not mean that adverse health effects will occur.MERCURY A-2 APPENDIX A MRLs are intended only to serve as a screening tool to help public health professionals decide where to look more closely. They may also be viewed as a mechanism to identify those hazardous waste sites that are not expected to cause adverse health effects. Mo st MRLs contain a degree of uncertainty because of the lack of precise toxicological information on the people who might be most sensitive (e.g., infants, elderly,nutritionally or immunologically compromised) to the effects of hazardous substances. ATSDR uses aconservative (i.e., protective) approach to address th is uncertainty consistent with the public health principle of prevention. Although human data are pref erred, MRLs often must be based on animal studies because relevant human studies are lacking. In th e absence of evidence to the contrary, ATSDR assumes that humans are more sensitive to the effects of hazar dous substance than animals and that certain persons may be particularly sensitive. Thus, the resulting MRL may be as much as a hundredfold below levels that have been shown to be nontoxic in laboratory animals. Proposed MRLs undergo a rigorous review process: Health Effects/MRL Workgroup reviews within the Division of Toxicology, expert panel peer revi ews, and agencywide MRL Workgroup reviews, with participation from other federal agencies and comments from the public. They are subject to change as new information becomes available concomitant with updati ng the toxicological profiles. Thus, MRLs in the most recent toxicological profiles supersede previ ously published levels.

Measurement of hand tremor induced by industrial exposure to metallic mercury. British Journal of Indus trial Medicine 40:204-208. Experimental design . Hand tremors were measured in 26 male workers exposed to metallic mercury and 25 control males working in the same facilities, but not exposed to mercury. Workers had been exposed to mercury through the manufacture of fluorescent tubes, chloralkali, or acetaldehyde. Mercury-exposedworkers had a duration of exposure of 15.3\u00b12.6 year s, blood mercury of 41.3\u00b13.5 micromoles Hg/L, mercury of 11.3\u00b11.2 micromoles Hg/mole of cr eatinine. The mean mercury level measured using personal air monitors was 0.026\u00b10.004 mg/m 3 (3 subjects were exposed to greater than 0.05 mg/m3). Hand tremors were measured in the subjects using an acceler ometer attached to the dorsum of the hand both at rest and while holding 1,250 grams. The highest peak frequency of the acceleration was determined. Effects noted in study and corresponding doses : The highest peak frequency of the tremor was greater in exposed men than in controls. The highest p eak frequency corresponded significantly to duration of exposure and age. Comparison of tremors using an i ndex of the entire spectrum of the tremor showed no differences between exposed men and controls at rest, but the changes observed between rest and load were higher in the exposed men. These changes correlated with the duration of exposure and biological indices of exposure (blood and mercury levels), but not with age. Dose and end point used for MRL derivation : 0.026 mg/m3; increased frequency of tremors.

To estimate an equivalent continuous e xposure concentration, the average concentration assumed for the 8 hour/day exposures was multiplied by 8/24 Uncertainty factors of 10 for variability in sensitivity to mercury within the human population and 3 for use of a minimal effect LOAEL in MRL derivation were then applied to the calculated 0.0062 mg/m3 value, yielding a chronic inhalation MRL of 0.2 \u00b5g/m3. It should be noted that this MRL, although based upon an adult working population, is considered also to be sufficiently protective of neurodevelopmental effects in developing embr yos/fetuses and children, the most sensitive subgroups for metallic mercury toxicity. LOAEL(ADJ) = 0.026 mg/m3 x (8 hr/24 hr) 0.0002 If an inhalation study in animals, list the convers ion factors used in determining human equivalent concentration (HEC) : No. Additional studies or pertinent inform ation which lend support to this MRL : Inhaled metallic mercury is quickly absorbed through the lungs into the blood. Its biologic half-life in humans is approximately 60days, with the half-life varying with the physiological compartment (e.g., 21 days in the head, versus 64 days in the kidneys; Cherian et al. 1978). Since the duration of exposure does influence the level of mercury in the body, the exposure level reported in the Fawer et al. (1983) occupational study was extrapolated from an 8-hour/day, 40-hour/workweek e xposure to a level equivalent to a continuous 24 hour/day, 7 days/week exposure as might be encounter ed near a hazardous waste site containing metallic mercury. The ability of long-term, low level exposure to meta llic mercury to produce a degradation in neurological performance was also demonstrated in other studies. One such study (Ngim et al. 1992) attributed adverse neurological effects to a lower average level of expos ure than did the Fawer et al. (1983) study; however, this study was not used in deriving a chronic i nhalation MRL due to uncertainties concerning the study protocol, including methodological and reporting deficien cies. In the Ngim et al. (1992) study, dentists with an average of 5.5 years of exposure to low levels of metallic mercur y were reported to have demonstrated impaired performance on several neurobehavi oral tests. Exposure levels measured at the time of the study ranged from 0.0007 to 0.042 mg/m 3, with an average of 0.014 mg/m3. Mean blood mercury levels among the dentists ranged from 0.6 to 57 \u00b5g/L, w ith a geometric mean of 9.8 \u00b5g/L. The performance of the dentists on finger tapping (motor speed measu re), trail making (visual scanning measure), digit symbol (measure of visuomotor coordination and concen tration), digit span, logical memory delayed recall (measure of visual memory), and Bender-Gestalt time (measures visuomotor coordination) weresignificantly poorer than controls. The exposed dentis ts also showed higher aggression than did controls. Furthermore, within the group of exposed dentists , significant differences were reported to have been observed between a subgroup with hi gh mercury exposure compared to a subgroup with lower exposure. These exposure severity subgroups were not compared to controls, and average exposure levels for the subgroups were not reported. The design and reporting of this study limit its usefulness in deriving an MRL for metallic mercury. The exposure status of the subjects was known to the investigator during testing, mercury levels were not reported for c ontrols, and methods used to correct for confounders (especially the common use in this population of traditional medicines containing mercury) were not reported. It was also unclear whether the resu lts for the mercury exposure group were inordinately influenced or skewed by the individual dentists with the highest exposures and/or blood levels. These confounding factors precluded the use of the Ngim et al. (1992) study for the derivation of an MRL, but thestudy does provide support for both the premise that MERCURY A-5 APPENDIX A low-dose chronic exposure to metallic mercury can r esult in adverse health sequelae and the chronic inhalation MRL that is based upon the Fawer et al. (1983) study of occupationally exposed individuals. Other occupational studies further support the ability of metallic mercury to induce neurologic deficits. Several studies have reported significant effects on tremor or cognitive skills among groups exposed occupationally to comparable or slightly higher (up to 0.076 mg/m3) levels (Ehrenberg et al. 1991; Piikivi et al. 1984; Roels et al. 1982). Difficulty with heel-to- toe gait was observed in thermometer plant workers subjected to mean personal breathing z one air concentrations of 0.076 mg/m3 (range of 0.026-0.27 mg/m3 (Ehrenberg et al. 1991). Tremors have also been reported in occupationally e xposed workers with urinary mercury concentrations of 50-100 \u00b5g/g creatinine, and blood levels of 10-20 \u00b5g/L (R oels et al. 1982). By comparison, blood mercury levels in the Fawer et al. (1983) study averaged 41.3 and 16.6 \u00b5mol Hg/L for the exposed and control groups, respectively. Urinary mercury levels for th e exposed workers in the Fawer et al. (1983) study averaged 11.3 \u00b5mol Hg/mol creatinine (about 20 \u00b5g/g creatinine), compared with 3.4 \u00b5mol/mol creatinine in the controls. In another study (Piikivi et al. 1984), decreases in performance on tests that measured intelligence (similarities) and memory (digit span and visual reproduction) were observed in chloralkali workers exposed for an average of 16.9 years (range, 10-37 years) to low levels of mercury when compared to an age-matched control group. In this study, significant differences from controls were observed on these tests among 16 workers with blood levels rangi ng from 75 to 344 nmol/L and urine levels ranging from 280 (about 56 \u00b5g/L) to 663 nmol/L. Abnormal nerv e conduction velocities have also been observed in chloralkali plant workers at a mean urine concentration of 450 \u00b5g/L (Levine et al.1982). These workers also experienced weakness, paresthesias, and muscle cramps. Prolongation of brainstem auditory evoked potentials was observed in workers with urinary merc ury levels of 325 \u00b5g/g creatinine (Discalzi et al. 1993). Prolonged somatosensory evoked potentials were found in 28 subjects exposed to airborne mercury concentrations of 20-96 mg/m3 (Langauer-Lewowicka and Kazibutowska 1989).

Additional studies or pertinent inform ation which lend support to this MRL : Several other studies examining the effects of oral exposure to inorganic me rcury salts have also show n renal toxicity in humans as a result of acute oral exposures. Kidney effects (i.e., heavy albuminuria, hypoalbuminemia, edema, andhypercholesterolemia) have been reported after therap eutic administration of inorganic mercury (Kazantzis et al. 1962). Acute renal failure has been observed in a number of case studies in which mercuric chloride has been (Afonso and deAlvarez 1960; Murphy et al. 1979; Samuels et al. 1982). Autopsy of a 35-year-old man who ingested a lethal dose of mercuric chloride and exhibited acute renal failure showed pale and swollen kidneys (Murphy et al. 1979). A case st udy reported acute renal failure characterized by oliguria, proteinuria, hematuria, and granular casts in a woman who 30 mg mercury/kg as mercuric chloride (Afonso and deAlvarez 1960). Another case st udy reported a dramatic increase in urinary protein secretion by a patient who ingested a single dose of 15.8 mg mercury/kg as mercuric chloride (assuming abody weight of 70 kg) (Pesce et al. 1977). The authors of the report surmised that the increased excretion of both albumin and 2-microglobulin were indicative of mercury-induced tubular and glomerular pathology. Acute renal failure that persisted for 10 days was also observed in a 19-month-old child who ingested an unknown amount of powdered mercuric chlo ride (Samuels et al. 1982). Decreased urine was also observed in a 22-year-old who attempted suic ide by ingesting approximately 20 mg mercury/kg (Chugh et al. 1978).

Effects of prenatal and postnatal methylmercury exposure from fish consumption on neurodevelopment: Outcomes at 66 mont hs of age in the Seychelles Child Development Study. JAMA 280(8):701-707. Experimental design . This MRL is based on the results of the Seychelles Child Development Study (SCDS), a series of evaluations on a population in the Seychelles Islands. The chronic oral MRL formethylmercury is based upon the Seychelles Child Development Study (SCDS), in which over 700 mother-infant pairs have, to date, been followed and tested from parturition through 66 months of age (Davidson et al. 1998). The SCDS was conducted as a double-blind study and used maternal hair mercury as the index of fetal exposure. Enrollees were recru ited by the head nurse/hospital midwife by asking the mothers if they wished to participate in the study when they arrived at the hospital for delivery. The first 779 who did not decline participation became the mothers in the study cohort. Of the initial 779 mothersenrolled in the study at parturition, 740 remained at the predetermined child testing age of 6.5 months, 738 remained in the 19-month cohort, 736 remained at 29 months, and 711 remained for the 66-month neurobehavioral and deve lopmental examinations. The Seychellois were chosen as a study population for a number of reasons. (1) All fish contain some level of methylmercury (Davidson et al. 1998); and the Se ychellois regularly consume a large quantity and variety of ocean fish, with 12 fish meals per week re presenting a typical methylmercury exposure. (2) The median total mercury concentration in 350 fish sampl ed from 25 species consumed by the Seychellois was <1 ppm (range, 0.004-0.75 ppm), comparable to that c onsumed by the U.S. population; thus, the methyl- mercury levels in the Seychellois population are 10-20 times those in the United States, not because they consume more highly contaminated fish than do Amer icans, but rather because they consume more fish than the U.S. population. (3) The Seychelles repr esent a relatively pristine environment, with no local industry for pollution, and are situated more than 1, 000 miles from any continent or large population center. (4) The population is highly literate, cooperative, and has minimal immigration and emigration. (5) The Seychellois constitute a generally healthy population, with low maternal alcohol consumption and tobacco use (<2%). (6) In the 66-month study cohort, the mean maternal hair level of total mercury during pregnancy was 6.8 ppm (range, 0.5-26.7 ppm). Effects noted in study and corresponding doses : The results of the 66-month testing in the SCDS revealed no evidence of adverse effects attributable to chroni c ingestion of low levels of methylmercury in fish (Davidson et al. 1998). In this st udy, developing fetuses were exposed in utero through maternal fish ingestion before and during pregna ncy (Davidson et al. 1998). Neona tes continued to be exposed to maternal mercury during breastfeeding (i.e., some mercury is secreted in breast milk), and methylmercuryMERCURY A-11 APPENDIX A exposure from the regular diet continued after the gradua l post-weaning shift to a fish diet. In the 66-month study cohort, the mean maternal hair level of total mercury during pre gnancy was 6.8 ppm (range, 0.5-26.7 ppm; n = 711), and the mean child hair level at the 66-month testing interval was 6.5 ppm (range, 0.9-25.8 ppm; n = 708). The 66-month test battery, wh ich was designed to test multiple developmental domains, included as primary measures the following: (1) General Cognitive Index (GCI) of the McCarthy Scales of Children's Abilities (to estimate cognitive ab ility); (2) the Preschool Language Scale (PLS) total score (to measure both expressive and receptive language ability); (3) the Letter and Word Recognition and (4) Applied Problems subtests of the Woodcock-Johnson (W-J) Tests of Achievement (to measure reading and arithmetic achievement); (5) the Bender-Gestalt test (to measure visual-spatial ability); and (6) the total T score from the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) (to m easure the child's social and adaptive behavior). Serum sampling revealed no detectable levels of PCBs (detection limit = 0.2 ng/mL). None of the tests indicated an adverse effect of me thylmercury exposure. In contrast, four of the six measures showed better scores in the highest MeHg -exposed groups, compared with lower exposure groups for both prenatal and postnatal exposure (the four test were the (1) General Cognitive Index (GCI) of the McCarthy Scales of Children's Abilities (to estimate cognitive ability); (2) the Preschool Language Scale (PLS) total score (to measure both expressive and receptive language ability); (3) the Letter and Word Recognition and (4) Applied Problems subtests of th e Woodcock-Johnson (W-J) Tests of Achievement (to measure reading and arithmetic achievement). While the positive outcomes are not considered to indicate any beneficial effect of methylmercury on neurologi cal development or behavior, they might be more appropriately attributed to the beneficial effects of omega-3 fatty acids or other constituents present in fish tissue, since the methylmercury levels in hair are know n to correlate closely with fish intake. The slight decreases in the subjectively reported activity level of boys reported in the 29-month observations were not seen during the 66-month tests. The mean maternal hair level of 15.3 ppm in the group with the highestexposure in the 66-month test cohort is, therefore, considered a NOAEL for SCDS, and is used by ATSDR as the basis for derivation of a chronic oral MRL for methylmercury. A related study (Myers et al. 1997) bythe same team of researchers from the University of Rochester examined the Seychellois children for attainment of the same developmental milestones repor ted to have been delayed in the Iraqi poisoning incident in the early 1970s (Cox et al. 1989) and found no such delays in the Seychellois children exposed in utero. Since the children had been exposed in utero , they represent the most sensitive subpopulation. Sensitivity of Neurobehavioral Measures /Reliability of Tests Used in Critical Study The neurobehavioral test battery used in the 66-month Seychelles study was designed to assess multiple developmental domains (Davidson et al. 1998). The test s were considered to be sufficiently sensitive and accurate to detect neurotoxicity in the presence of a number of confounding factors. On-site test administration reliability was assessed by an independe nt scorer, and mean interclass correlations for interscorer reliability were 0.96-0.97 (Davidson et al. 1998). The sample size was determined to be sufficient to detect a 5.7 point difference on any test with a mean (SD) of 100 (16) between low (0-3 ppm)and high >12 ppm) hair mercury c oncentration groups for a 2-sided test (A = power).MERCURY A-12 APPENDIX A C'f(d b(V'AD(AB(d b(VConverting blood concentration to daily intake. The concentration of mercury in the blood may be c onverted to a daily intake by using the following equation from WHO (1990): Where: C = concentration in blood f = fraction of the daily intake taken up by the blood d = daily dietary intakeb = elimination constant A D= percent of mercury intake in diet that is absorbed AB= percent of the absorbed amount that enters the blood V = volume of blood in the body Hair to Blood Concentration Ratio . The hair:blood concentration ratio for total mercury is frequently cited as 250. However, a precise basis for this particular value is unclear. Ratios reported in the literature range from 140 to 370, a difference of more than a factor of 2.5 (see Table 2-9). Differences in th e location of hair sampled (head versus chest, distance of sample from head or skin) may contribute to di fferences in observed ratios between studies. For example, as much as a 3-fold seasonal variation in mercur y levels was observed in average hair levels for a group of individuals with moderate-t o-high fish consumption rates, with yearly highs occurring in the fall and early winter (Phelps et al. 1980; Suzuki et al. 1992). Thus, it is important to obtain hair samples asclose to the follicle as possible to obtain an estimate of recent blood levels. Large errors (the direction of which depends on whether samples were taken while blood levels were falling or rising) could result if hair samples are not taken close to the scalp. Several studi es did not report the distance to the scalp for the hair samples taken. The high slope reported by Tsubaki (1971a ) may have reflected the fact that mercury levels were declining at the time of sampling (Berglund et al . 1971), so the hair levels may reflect earlier, higher blood levels. Hair taken from different parts of the body also may yield different ratios. In 26 subjects with moderate-to-high fish consumption, axillary hair (i.e., from the armpit area) was found to contain an average of 23% less mercury than head hair (Skerfving et al. 1974). Phelps et al. (1980) obtained multiple blood samples and sequentially analyzed lengths of hair from 339 individuals in Northwestern Ontario. The large sample size and the attention to sampling and analysiswith regard to the hair:blood relati onship make this study the most appropriate to use for estimating the mercury blood levels of the Seyche llois women during pregnancy. The actual ratio Phelps et al. (1980) observed between the total mercury concentration in hair taken close to the scalp and simultaneous blood sampling for this group was 296. To estimate the actual ratio, the authors assumed that blood and hairsamples were taken following complete cessation of meth ylmercury intake. They also assumed a half-life of methylmercury in blood of 52 days and a lag of 4 week s for appearance of the relevant level in hair at the scalp. Based on these assumptions, they calculated that if the actual hair:blood ratio were 200, they would have observed a ratio of 290 (i.e., essentially equivalent to the observed value of 296). Based on these and other considerations, Phelps et al. (1980) state that the actual ratio is \"probably higher than 200, but less than the observed value of 296.\" As the authors point out, two-thirds of the study population were sampledMERCURY A-13 APPENDIX A during the falling phase of the seasonal variation and one-thi rd or less in the rising phase. This fact would tend to result in a lower observed ratio; therefore, the actual average value is likely to be >200. Phelps et al. (1980) also provide estimates assuming a 2- week lag for the appearance of the relevant level of mercury in the centimeter of hair nearest the scalp. For a 2-week lag time, an actual ratio of 250 would have resulted in an observed ratio of 301 (again, essentia lly identical to the observed value of 296). A study of ingestion of a large dose of mercuric chloride in one individual suggests that the lag time is longer than 2 weeks (Suzuki et al. 1992). Hair samples were ta ken at 41 and 95 days following ingestion of the mercuric chloride. In the 41-day hair sample, a la rge mercury peak occurred in the centimeter of hair closest to the scalp, with no elevation in mercury in th e second centimeter of hair. Head hair grows at a rate of about 1.1 cm a month (Al-Shahristani and Shihab 1974; Cox et al. 1989). If emergence had occurred sothat the elevation in mercury could be measured in th e first centimeter of hair by 2 weeks after exposure, then by day 41 after exposure the peak should have moved into the second centimeter of hair, at least enough to raise the mercury level slightly in the second centimeter. Because no elevation was seen in the second centimeter of hair at 41 days, it would appear that emergence occurred at a lag of >2 weeks. In the hair sample taken at 95 days, the leading edge of the mercury peak occurred in the third centimeter of hair. Based on the data presented in Phelps et al. (1980) and the lag time indicated in the individual studied bySuzuki et al. (1992), the actual average value is lik ely to be somewhere between 200 and 250. Because the data do not allow a more accurate determination of an average ratio, the value 250 is acceptable for the purpose of estimating average blood levels in the Seyc hellois population. Using 250 rather than a lower number results in a lower MRL. It should be noted th at a wide range in hair:blood ratios has been reported for individuals in various studies: 137-342 in Sori a et al. (1992), 171-270 in Phelps et al. (1980), and 137-585 in Birke et al. (1972). Therefore, this ratio (250) should not be used as the sole basis fordetermining levels of exposure a nd potential effect for individuals. Calculation of dietary intake from blood concentration . Fraction of mercury in diet that is absorbed (AD). Radiolabeled methyl-mercuric nitrate was administered in water to three healthy volunteers (Aberg et al. 1969). The uptake was >95%. Miettinen et al. (1971) incubated fish liver homogenate MeHgNO3 to yield a methylmercury proteinate. The proteinate was then fed to fish that were kille d after a week, cooked, and fed to volunteers after confirmation of the methylmercury in the fish. Mean uptake exceeded 94%. For the derivation of an MRL, an absorption factor of 0.95 is used. Fraction of the absorbed dose that is found in the blood (AB). The value 0.05 has been used for this parameter in the past (Berglund et al. 1971; WHO 1990) . Three studies report observations of the fraction of the absorbed methylmercury dose distributed to blood volume in humans. Kershaw et al. (1980) report an average fraction of 0.059 of the absorbed dose in the total blood volume, based on a study of 5 adult male subjects who ingested methylmercury-contamin ated tuna. In a group of 9 male and 6 female volunteers who had received 203Hg-methylmercury in fish, approximately 10% of the total body burden was present in 1 L of blood in the first few days after exposure, dropping to approxi mately 5% over the first 100 days (Miettinen et al. 1971). In another study, an average value of 1.14% for the percentage of absorbed dose in 1 kg of blood was derived from subj ects who consumed a known amount of methylmercury in fish over a period of 3 months (Sherlock et al. 1984). Average daily intake for the 4 groups observed in the study ranged from 43 to 233 \u00b5g/day. The author s report a dose-related effect on the estimated percentage of the absorbed dose in 1 kg of blood, w ith 1.26% of the absorbed dose in 1 kg of blood at an average daily intake of 43 \u00b5g/day and 1.03% of the absorbed dose in 1 kg of blood at an average daily intake of 233 \u00b5g/day. The average for all subjects in the study was 1.14%. When individual values for distribution to one kilogram of blood reported in the study are converted into the pe rcentage of the absorbed MERCURY A-14 APPENDIX A C'f(d b(V'AD(AB(d b(Vdose in the total blood volume (assuming that blood is 7% of body weight [Best 1961] and using body weights reported for individuals in the study), the average value for AB for all individuals is 0.056 (0.057 using the values for percentage in 1 kg normali zed for body weight as reported in the study). The average value for AB for 6 women as reported in Sherlock et al. (1984) is 0.048 (0.047 using values normalized for body weight). The average for 14 men is 0.059 (0.061 using values normalized for bodyweight). The average values for A B for all studies ranged from 0.047 to 0.061 (the values for women and men reported in Sherlock et al. [1984]). The data suggest that the average value of AB for women may be lower than that for men, and they further suggest that 0. 05 may be appropriate for m odeling intake in a group of women (Sherlock et al. 1984). Based on these studies, the best estimate of AB based on the available data is 0.05. Use of a higher value (i.e., 0.06 instead of 0.05) for this parameter would result in a lower MR, but the sensitive populations are pregnant wo men and developing fetuses, making th e 0.5 value more appropriate for the Seychelles study population. Elimination constant (b) . Reported clearance half-times for methylmercury from blood or hair range from 48 to 65 days (Table 2-5). The average elimination constant based on the 6 studies listed in Table 2.5 is 0.014. The average of the individual values for b reported for 20 volunteers ingesting from 42 to 233 \u00b5g Hg/day in fish for 3 months (Sherlock et al. 1984) is also 0.014. Use of the value 0.014 for this parameter, rather than 0.01 (as used by WHO 1990), results in a higher MRL. Volume of blood in body (V), and body weight . Blood volume is assumed to be 7% of body weight, with an increase to about 9% during pregnancy (Best 1961). Da ta for the body weight of the Seychelles Islands women were not found. Assuming an average body weight of 60 kg for women, the blood volume is 4.2 L(60 kg x 0.07 L/kg). Calculation of Exposure Dose The concentration of mercury in hair is assumed to be 250 times the concentration in blood. Using the mean total mercury level of 15.3 ppm in maternal hair ta ken at parturition to represent a NOAEL in the 66-month Seychelles testing (Davidson et al. 1998), the corr esponding methylmercury concentration in blood would be: 1/250 x 15.3 1 mg/1,000 \u00b5g x 1,000 g/L = 0.061 mg/L. Calculation of Daily Intake from Blood Concentration Using the above equation to relate th e concentration in blood (C, in \u00b5g/L) to daily intake (d, in \u00b5g/day): where C = (percent of ingested dose abso rbed through the GI tract x percen t of that dose absorbed into the blood x the daily amount ingested) divided by (e limination constant x blood volume in a 60 kg female) that is, C = (0.95 x 0.05 x d)/(0.014 x 4.2) C = 0.81 d 0.061 d d = 0.075 mg/dayMERCURY A-15 APPENDIX A Using the assumed body weight of 60 kg for women, the estimated dose that would result in a hair level of 15.3 ppm is 0.075/60 kg = 0.0013 mg/kg/day. Theref ore, the NOAEL derived from the highest exposure group (n = 95) at 66 months is 0.0013 mg/kg/day. Dose and end point used for MRL derivation : 0.0013 mg/kg/day NOAEL [ X ] NOAEL [ ] LOAELUncertainty and Modifying Factors used in MRL derivation : [ ] 1 [ ] 3 [ ] 10 (for use of a minimal LOAEL) [ ] 1 [ ] 3 [ ] 10 (for extrapolation from animals to humans)[ ] 1 [X] 3 [ ] 10 (for human pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic variability) [X] 1.5 [ ] 3 [ ] 10 (Modifying factor to account for domain-specific findings in Faroe study) Consideration of Uncertainty The standard/traditional areas of uncertainty addressed in any duration-specific MRL intra-human variability (i.e.,differences in susceptibility to a substance or effect w ithin the human population); (3) use of an LOAEL for MRL derivation when an NOAEL for the critical effect is not available; and (4) extrapolation from subchronic to chronic duration. In addition, a modifyi ng factor may also be used when special circumstances exist that may contribute to, or introduce, uncertainty into the calculated health guidance value (MRL) in an area not typically covered by the traditional uncertainty factor approach. The NOAEL of 15.3 ppm mercury in maternal hair from Davidson et al. (1998) used as the starting point for MRL derivation was based upon an unusually large study cohort of the population considered most sensitive to the neurodevelopmental effects of methylmercury, i. e., pregnant women and their developing fetuses. The negative results of this study are strongly supporte d by the BMD NOAEL range of 13 to 21 ppm calculated for the New Zealand cohort of 237 mother-child pairs (Crump et al. 1998). Consequently, much of the uncertainty normally present in the MRL derivation pr ocess does not exist in the case of methylmercury. Nonetheless, in view of the nature of the most susceptible group (developing fetuses) and some questions raised in the vast human data base for this ch emical, an aggregate value of 4.5 was employed. This value (4.5) was based upon three separate compone nts, two of which are interrelated and the other independent. For the Seychelles data, a value of 1. 5 was used to address the variability in hair-to-blood ratios among women and fetuses in the U.S. populati on, as determined by pharmacokinetic modeling of actual data by Clewell et al. (1998); a second value of 1.5 was applied to address the remainder of any inter- individual variability (i.e., pharmacodynamics) in the U. S. population. A third, and independent, factor of 1.5 was employed to account for the possibility that the domain-specific tests, as employed extensively in the Faroe Islands, but not the Seychelles (which used prim arily neurobehavioral tests of global function) might be able to detect very subtle neurological effect s not tested for in the 66-month Seychelles cohort. The World Health Organization (WHO, 1993, 1996) has defined the -kinetic and -dynamic components of intrahuman variability as being equal contributors to, and collectively constituting the total of, human variability. In order to ensure a conservative appro ach, these two interdependent components were added to give a composite uncertainty factor of three (i.e., 1. 5 + 1.5 = 3) to account for the full range of variability attributable to mercury in the Seychelles study. A modi fying factor of 1.5 was also used to account for the MERCURY A-16 APPENDIX A possibility of domain-specific effects, as were seen in th e Faroe study, being attributable to mercury. Since these effects were considered to be entirely separate or \"independent\" events, this modifying factor of 1.5 was multiplied by the uncertainty factor of 3.0 (for uncer tainty attributable solely to the Seychelles study) to yield an aggregate uncertainty of 4.5 for chronic oral exposure to methylmercury. While domain-specific tests from the Seychelles were re viewed at the North Carolina meeting in November 1998 and the results failed to demonstrate effects, the tests do not represent the full range of domain-specific tests that were administered in the Faroe Islands. For these reasons, and based on our consultation with our Board of Scientific Counselors about concerns for \"mi ssing\" data sets (i.e., in relation to the Executive Order of children's health and the agency's efforts to protect the health of children, including the developing fetus), ATSDR determined that an additional factor of 1.5 should be used since the full range of domain-specific neuropsychological test results from the Seychelles ar e not yet available. When these results become available and if they fail to show domain-specific eff ects, this additional factor of 1.5 would no longer be needed. At that time ATSDR will re-evaluate its MRL, as well as all other relevant data, in compliance with the agency's mandates and authorities. Therefore, in the calculation of the chronic oral MRL for methylmercury, the NOAEL of 0.0013 mg/kg/day from the 66-month study (Davidson et al. 1998) is divided by 4.5, giving a chronic oral MRL formethylmercury of an inhalation study in animals, list the convers ion factors used in determining human equivalent concentration (HEC) : Not applicable. Additional studies or pertinent inform ation which lend support to this MRL : Crump et al. (1998) conducted benchmark dose (BMD ) calculations and additional regression analyses of data collected in a study in which a series of scholastic and psychological tests were administered to children whose mothers had been exposed to methylmercury dur ing pregnancy. Hair samples were collected from 10,970 new mothers in New Zealand in 1977 and 1978. Hi gh hair mercury levels were considered to be those over 6 ppm, which was the hair level predicted to result at steady state from consumption of mercury at the WHO/FAO Provisional Tolerable Weekly Intake of 0.3 mg total mercury/week and 0.2 mg methylmercury/week. By this criterion, 73 of appr oximately 1,000 mothers who had consumed fish more than three times/week during pregnancy were determined to have high hair mercury levels. In 1985, when the children were 6 to 7 years of age, 61 children (1 set of twins) of the 73 mothers in the high hair mercury group were located, and constituted the high exposure group, which was matched with three control groups (one with 3-6 ppm maternal hair mercury levels, one with 0-3 ppm whose mothers had been high fish consumers, and one with 0-3 ppm whose mothers ha d not been high fish consumers). The entire study cohort consisted of 237 children. A ba ttery of 26 psychological and scholastic tests were administered to the children at school during the year 1985. Mothers were interviewed at the time of test administration toobtain additional data on social and environmental f actors. In the high exposure group of children, one boy's mother had a hair mercury level of 86 ppm, wh ich was more than four times higher than the next highest hair mercury level of 20 ppm. BMDs (10% response rate) calculated from five tests ranged from 32 to 73 ppm, when the 86 ppm mother's child was incl uded. This corresponded to a BMDL range of 17 to 24 ppm. Although none of the 86 ppm child's test scor es was an outlier according to the definition used in the analyses, his scores were significantly influential in the analyses. When this child was omitted from the analyses, BMDs ranged from 13 to 21, with corresponding BMDLs of 7.4 to 10 ppm. Developing fetuses in the SCDS were exposed through mate rnal fish ingestion befo re and during pregnancy. Each child was evaluated at 19 months and again at 29 months (\u00b12 weeks) for infant intelligence (BayleyMERCURY A-17 APPENDIX A Scales of Infant Development [BSID] Mental and Psyc homotor Scales), with a modified version of the BSID Infant Behavior Record to measure adaptive behavior s at 29 months (Davidson et al. 1995b). Testing was performed by a team of Seychellois nurses extensively tr ained in administration of the BSID. Maternal hair concentrations, measured in hair segments that co rresponded to pregnancy, ra nged from 0.5 to 26.7 ppm, with a median exposure of 5.9 ppm for the entire study group. The mean BSID Mental Scale Indicesdetermined at both 19 and 29 months were found to be comparable to the mean performance of U.S. children. The BSID Psychomotor Scale Indices at both measurement intervals were two standard deviation units above U.S. norms, but were still consistent with previous findings of motor precocity in children reared in African countries. The study found no effect that could be attributed to mercury on the BSID scores obtained at either the 19- or 29-month measuremen t/testing interval. The 29-month cohort represented 94% of the 779 mother-infant pairs initially enrolled in the st udy, and approximately 50% of all live births in the Seychelles in 1989. The only observation in the 29-month testing that might be attributable to prenatal mercury exposure was a slight decrease in the activity level in boys (but not girls) as determined by the Bayley Infant Behavior Record (subjective observation). Whereas this decr ease was significant in males (p = 0.0004), it was not statistically significant in females (p = 0.87). Wh en the subjective activity scores for male and female children were evaluated collectively, no statistically significant or remarkable decrease in activity was apparent outside the >12 ppm maternal hair concentra tion group. The affect on activity level in boys is not considered an adverse effect by the authors of the study. Grandjean et al. (1997b, 1998) reported another epidem iological study of methylmercury exposure for a population in the Faroe Islands. Although the Faroese are a fishing culture, the major source ofmethylmercury exposure for this population is pilot whal e meat, which is intermittently consumed as part of the cultural tradition . The initial study cohort consis ted of 1,022 singleton births occurring in a 21-month window during 1986-1987. At approximately 7 years of age, neurobehavioral testing was conducted on 917 of the remaining cohort members. No abnormalities attributable to mercury were found during clinical examinations or neurophysiological testing. A neur opsychological test battery was also conducted, which included the following: Finger Tapping; Hand- Eye Coordination; reaction time on a Continuous Performance Test; Wechsler Intelligen ce Scale for Children - Revised Digit Spans, Similarities, and Block Designs; Bender Visual Motor Gestalt Test; Boston Naming Test; and California Verbal Learning Test (Children). Neuropsychological tests emphasized moto r coordination, perceptual-motor performance, and visual acuity. Pattern reversal visual evoked potentials (VEP) with binocular full-field stimulation, brain stem auditory evoked potentials (BAEP), postural sway , and the coefficient of variation for R-R inter-peak intervals (CVRR) on the electrocardiogram were all measured. The neuropsychological testing indicatedmercury-related dysfunction in the domains of language, attention, me mory, and visuospatial and motor function (to a lesser extent), which the authors cons idered to remain after the children of women with maternal hair mercury concentrations above 10 \u00b5g/g ( 10 ppm) were excluded. While this study represents a significant contribution to the human database for methylmercury exposure and effects, a number of potentially influential factors not fully considered as possible covariates somewhat cloud the interpretation of the results. These differences between the neuropsychological eff ects observed in the Faroe Island cohort and the absence of effects reported in the Seychelles Island cohor t might result from a variety of factors. The Faroe Island children were older (7-8 years ve rsus 5.5 in the SCDS). Some of the measurement instruments (i.e., the neuropsychological test administered) were also di fferent. Since the first neuropsychological testing in the Faroe study was not conducted until 7 years of ag e, it is not known whether the observed effects might have been apparent at an earlier age. Ongoing and planned future testing of the Seychelles population will provide additional information on the progression of an y observed effects. Further examination of the MERCURY A-18 APPENDIX A Seychelles population using the neuropsychological test that showed positive results in the Faroe Islands population will also allow a more direct comparison of results. The diet in the two studies was also considerably diffe rent. The majority of the mercury exposure to the Faroe Island population came from whale meat (estimated at about 3 ppm in muscle tissue) with a relativelysmall portion coming from fish. Some of the mercury in whale meat is in the form of inorganic mercury. In the Seychelles study, all of the mercury came from fish as methylmercury with concentrations of around0.3 ppm. Whale meat blubber is widely consumed in the Faroe Islands and also contains polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). Grandjean et al. (1995b) estimated a daily intake of 200 \u00b5g of PCB. This value can be compared to the Tolerable Daily Intake of PCBs est ablished by the FDA, of 60-70 \u00b5g/day for an adult. Further statistical analysis of the possible influen ce of PCBs on the observed study results needs to be conducted (see the discussion below on Peer Panel 1Review of Key Studies for additional comments). The primary biomarker used to estimate mercury exposur e was also different between the two studies. The Faroe Island analysis used cord blood, and the Seyche lles study used maternal hair level. The use of mercury in cord blood has the advantage of being a more direct measure of exposure to the fetus, but the levels at term may not reflect exposures at earlier deve lopmental stages. While Grandjean et al. (1997) did report maternal hair mercury levels, the mean hair level for the interquartile range of 2.6-7.7 ppm was reported only as a geometric average (4.27 ppm). In contrast, the Seychellois study reported only an arithmetic mean level for the entire study population (6.8 ppm). While both are valid measures, a directcomparison of \"average\" values for the two studies is not possible without further statistical analysis of both data sets. In the case of the Faroe study, there were no data pr esented in the peer-reviewed publications to address variability of food/whale meat or blubber intake am ong the Faroe Islanders, making it difficult to evaluate the possibility of peak intake levels during critical development phases. Consumption data was reported only as <1 pilot whale meat meal/month and 1-2 fish m eals per week. In contrast, the Seychelles dietary habits provide a relatively stable intake, and a high degree of correlation was found between mean hair levels in samples covering each trimester versus levels in samples for the entire pregnancy (Cernichiari et al. 1995a). Cernichiari et al. (1995b) also report a good correlation between levels of total mercury in neonatal brain and levels in the co rresponding maternal hair. While the contribution of continued mercury exposure through breast feeding or post-weaning diet was not fully addressed in the Seychellois study reports (Davidson 1995, 1998), that is not considered a significant drawback with the study, since no effects on neurobahavioral/neuropsychological testing were seen at any maternal hair level. In the Faroese assessment of latent neuropsychological effects from an in utero exposure to mercury, however, the role of continuing postnatal exposure to mercury either fro m breast milk or from ingestion of methylmercury- containing foods (e.g., pilot whale meat) is less clear. Specifically, it is not known what proportion, if any,of the neuropsychological effects reported in the Faroe Island population could be attributed to seven years of postnatal exposure to methylmercury in food. Th e variability and magnitude of this postnatal exposure should, therefore, be further evaluated. Peer Panel Review of Key Studies In addition to the traditional peer review process that precedes publication in most scientific journals, the studies considered by ATSDR for use in estimating a chronic oral MRL for methylmercury underwent two stringent reviews by recognized experts in the environmental health field. On July 20 and 21, 1998, ATSDR assembled a panel of 18 experts from the scientific and medical communities to review current issues and the releva nt literature on mercury and its compounds, includingMERCURY A-19 APPENDIX A methylmercury (ATSDR 1999). Several members of each of the respective research teams that conducted the Iraqi, Seychelles, Faroe, and Madeira studies we re included among the expert panelists, and provided extensive overviews of their studies. The presentati ons were followed by an open, wide- ranging scientific discussion of the merits and interpretations of the currently available studies. Topics of significantdiscussion included the relative merits of the respec tive study populations, exposure regimens, sensitivity of neurobehavioral measures, and determination of an uncertainty factor. While it was unanimously agreed that the Seychelles and Faroe studies were both excelle nt studies that provided a significant contribution to the human database for methylmercury exposure and effects, a number of factors that could have contributed to the study results, but were not consid ered as possible statistical covariates, were discussed. In the case of the Faroe study, the consumption of wh ale blubber, which is known to be contaminated with PCBs, DDT, and possibly other organochlorines, introduces a potentially significant influence on the studyresults. Weihe et al. (1996) reported that the PCB a nd DDT concentrations in blubber of pilot whales taken in Faroese waters are about 30 ppm and 20 ppm, respectiv ely. In contrast, the Seychellois population does not eat marine mammals at all. In addition, the Faroe study did not address other possible statisticalcovariates, such as the dietary and nutritional status of the study population and the use of tobacco duringpregnancy, further complicating the interpre tation of the neuropsychological test results. On November 18-20, 1998, a workshop on Scientific Issu es Relevant to the Assessment of Health Effects from Exposure to Methylmercury was conducted in Ralei gh, North Carolina. Jointly sponsored by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, the Na tional Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS), the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the Food and Drug Administration(FDA), the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the National Oceanic and AtmosphericAdministration (NOAA), the Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP), the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), and ATSDR, the purpose of this workshop was to discuss and evaluate the major epidemiologic studies that associated methylmercury expos ure and the results of an array of developmental measures in children. These studies monitored and ev aluated exposed populations in Iraq, the Seychelles Islands, the Faroe Islands, and the Amazon River Basin. A number of animal studies were also considered in support of a human health risk assessment. Pr esentation of these studies by the research team that conducted the study was followed by an expert pane l evaluation that examined each study, taking into consideration the exposure data, experimental desi gn and statistical analysis, potential confounders and variables, and neurobehavioral endpoints evaluated. A fifth panel evaluated the results of relevant animal studies. Significant issues that were discussed included the use of umbilical cord blood mercury levels vs. hair mercury concentrations as an index of meth ylmercury exposure during pregnancy, the patterns of exposure, the dietary/health status of study popul ations, other potentially re levant exposures, other confounding influences, and the adjustments made for st atistical covariates. All five panels at this workshop commended the efforts of the investigators and respective staffs of the Seychelles and Faroe studies for conducting highly sophisticated investiga tions under difficult conditions. However, specific findings of several of the panels raise issues that, at present, preclude the Faroe data from consideration as a starting point for MRL derivation. In their addressal of the potential influence of concurrent PCB exposure on the Faroe results, the Confounders and Variables (Epidemiology) panel indicated that with respect to four of the pre-natal outcomes (related primarily to verbal and memory pe rformance), when PCBs were included in the model, only one of these outcomes is specifically related to mercury exposure. Concerning this matter, the panel wrote that \"... the most likely explanation is that both (mercury and PCBs)... affect these three outcomes, but their relative contributions cannot be determined given their concurrence in this population.\" The Neurobehavioral Endpoints Panel also looked at this issue, and noted that \"PCB exposure might act as an effect modifier, increasing the susceptibility to MeHg.\"; however, this panel further indicated that it did not believe that the effects seen in the Faroe Islands were due to uncontrolled confounding by PCBs. A thirdMERCURY A-20 APPENDIX A panel that addressed the issue of concurrent PCB expos ures, the Statistics/Design Panel, noted that only 3 of 208 PCB congeners were measured in the Faroe study , and stated that it \"seems likely that mercury was measured more accurately than the biologically rele vant PCB exposure. Consequently even if the neurological effects seen in this study were caused en tirely by PCBs, it is possible that mercury would still be more highly correlated with these effects than PCBs .\" The Statistics/Design Panel also said that \"the best method to deal with this problem would be to study a population where exposure to PCBs is not an issue.\" This statement points directly to the Seychelles study as the study most appropriate for MRLderivation. Another issue raised at Raleigh workshop concerned the taking of hair samples for determining pre-natal exposure. In the Seychelles, hair samples were collected 6 months post-partum, and segments corresponding to pregnancy were selected for analysis. In the case of the Faroese, hair samples were taken at the scalp. Regarding that, the Confounders and Variab les (Epidemiology) panel stated that \"Given the time it takes the Hg to be excreted into the hair, we can assume that samples collected at parturition do not cover the last 6 weeks of gestation, during whic h critically important neuronal proliferation and differentiation is taking place.\" Regarding both the Seychelles and Faroe studies, th e Neurobehavioral Endpoints Panel found \"no specific neurobehavioral signature injury from MeHg\" in the da ta from either study (Seychelles or Faroe). The same panel also noted that episodic exposure in the Fa roe Islands (1-2 fish meals/week and <1 pilot whale meal/month) \"may reduce the likelihood of detecting a consistent 'neurobehavioral signature injury' specific to MeHg and may account for different observa tions in children with the same average exposure.\" Based upon the discussions at the Raleigh workshop and the individual panel findings, as well as the aforementioned Atlanta expert panel review, ATSDR h as determined the Seychellois study to represent the most appropriate and reliable data base currently av ailable for calculation of a chronic oral MRL from a population exposed only to methylmercury by a releva nt route of exposure for the overall U.S. population. [It should be emphasized that the Seychelles study and the Faroe study represent credible scientific contributions by widely respected research teams. Similarly, both studies extend our knowledge base wellbeyond that provided by the Iraqi study and make significant contributions to our understanding of the effects of low-level exposure to methylmercury by an exposure route and vehicle (i.e., food) relevant to U.S. populations. The continuing monitoring and ev aluation of the Seychellois and Faroese populations with more comparable neurobehavioral indices shoul d help strengthen our understanding of the effects of low level chronic methylmercury exposure and should reduce the uncertainty regarding the public health implications of exposure.] Other epidemiology studies were also considered by th e workshop panels. Lebel et al. (1997) evaluated a fish-eating populations in the Amazon River Basin with a neurofunctional test battery and clinical manifestations of nervous system dysfunction in rela tion to hair mercury concentrations. The villagers examined live along the Tapajos River, a tributary of the Amazon. The study population consisted of 91 adult inhabitants 15-31 years of age. Hair merc ury levels were below 50 \u00b5g/g (ppm). Clinical examinations were essentially normal, although pe rsons displaying disorganized movements on an alternating movement task and those with restricted vi sual fields generally had higher hair mercury levels. Near visual contrast, sensitivity, and manual dext erity (adjusted for age) were found to decrease significantly with increasing mercury levels, while a tendency for muscular fatigue and decreasing strength were observed in women. The authors suggested that dose-dependent nervous sy stem alterations might be associated with hair mercury levels below 50 ppm. This study, however, also had a number of potentially confounding factors. The impact of parasitic and ot her diseases endemic to the study area is of primary MERCURY A-21 APPENDIX A concern in the interpretation of the Lebel et al. (1997) results. In addition, the overall nutritional status of the study population was not known or reported, and the use of neuroactive drugs (from local herbs, plants, roots, or mushrooms) was not considered as a poten tial confounder or covariate. The previous mercury exposure history of the study cohort was also unclear . This is of particular importance because gold mining procedures that use metallic mercury have been commonly practiced along the Amazon Basin fordecades. Finally, the endpoints of the Lebel et al. ( 1977) study evaluated adult toxicity and not effects in the developing fetus or the newborn (i.e., the most sensitive human population). The panel also reviewed the Iraqi study. Cox et al. (1989) and WHO (1990) reported delayed onset of walking in offspring in Iraqi children whose mo thers were exposed to methylmercury through the consumption of seed grain treated with methylmercury as a fungicide (Al-Mufti et al. 1976; Bakir et al.1973; Cox et al. 1989; Marsh et al. 1981, 1987). Expos ure to methylmercury from other sources (e.g., fish or meat) was probably very low or nonexistent (Al-Mufti et al. 1976). It is likely that the children wereexposed both prenatally through the placenta and pos tnatally through the mother's milk. A maternal exposure level of 0.0012 mg/kg/day, corresponding to the hair level of 14 ppm, was estimated using a simple, one-compartment pharmacokinetic model. Myers et al. (1997) evaluated the population of the SC DS for developmental milestones similar to those determined in Iraq. As part of this ongoing study, cohort children were evaluated at 6.5, 19, 29, and 66 months of age. At 19 months care-givers were asked at what age the child walked (n=720 out of 738) and talked (n=680). Prenatal mercury exposure was determin ed by atomic absorption analysis of maternal hair segments corresponding to hair growth during the pregna ncy. The median mercury level in maternal hair for the cohort in this analysis was 5.8 ppm, with a range of 0.5-26.7 ppm. The mean age (in months) atwalking was 10.7 (SD=1.9) for females and 10.6 (SD=2.0) for males. The mean age for talking (inmonths) was 10.5 (SD=2.6) for females, and 11.0 (SD=2. 9) for males. After adjusting for covariates and statistical outliers, no association was found between the age at which Seychellois children walked or talked and prenatal exposure to mercury. The ages for achievement of the developmental milestones were normal for walking and talking in the Seychellois t oddlers following prenatal exposure to methylmercury from a maternal fish diet. The 5.8 ppm NOAEL of this study is considerably below the one estimated from the dose-response analysis of the data for the Iraqi methylmercury poisonings (10 ppm). Clarkson (1995) raised some interesting issues concerni ng whether is it reasonable to apply health effects data based on an acute exposure to methylmercury fungicide eaten in homemade bread (in the 1971-1972Iraq incident) to fish-eating populations having chronic exposure to much lower concentrations of methyl- mercury. Clarkson (1995) addressed two specific issues. The first regards the body's \"defensemechanisms\" that serve to mitigate the potential dama ge from mercury. One such mechanism in the case of methylmercury involves an enterohepatic cycling process in which methylmercury from dietary sourcesabsorbed through the intestine is carri ed to the liver, where substantial quantities are secreted back into the bile and returned to the intestinal tract. During th e residence time in the gut, microflora break the carbon- mercury bond, converting methylmercury into inorganic mercury, which in turn is poorly absorbed and is excreted in the feces. This creat es an effective detoxification pathway for low-dose dietary exposures to methylmercury, but probably not for acute, high-dose e xposures, such as occurred in Iraq. Secondly, the transport of methylmercury into brain tissue is inhibited by the presence of many amino acids, includingleucine, methionine, and phenylalanine . Thus, it is possible that the rising plasma concentrations of amino acids from ingestion of fish protein may serve to depress the uptake of methylmercury by the brain. While both of these issues need further laboratory/clini cal investigation, they do raise appropriate questions concerning the relevance of the relatively short-term (i.e., about six weeks), high-level contaminated grain exposure scenario encountered in Iraq to the dietary methylmercury exposure scenarios encountered in many MERCURY A-22 APPENDIX A fish-eating populations (e.g., the Seyc helles Islanders, Faroe Islanders, Pe ruvian villagers, and Inuit native people of Greenland). This positi on is supported by Cicmanec (1996), who reviewed data from the Iraqi study, as well as data from studies of fish-consuming popul ations in the Faroe Islands, Seychelles Islands, and Peruvian fishing villages. Cicmanec concluded that the Iraqi population does not represent a sensitive subpopulation within a perinatal group; rather, the relative lower threshold identified in that study was the result of confounders. Crump et al. (1995) reanaly zed the dose-response data from the Cox et al. (1989) report of the Iraqi incident and found the results to be potentially skewed by inadequacies in the study design and data-collection methods. Shortc omings or potentially confounding factors include: (1) the retrospective recall of developmental milestones by mothers and other family members; (2) the lack of precision in thedetermination of birth and other milestone dates; (3 ) and the possible biasing of the dose-response analysis by variation in symptom reporting and infant sex co mposition in the two study subcohorts. Crump et al. (1995) noted that perhaps the most serious limitation of the Iraqi study is the inability to assess the potential effects of low-level chronic-duration exposure to meth ylmercury, as these particular data are based on very high intake levels over a re latively brief period of time. No increase in the frequency of neurodevelopmenta l abnormalities in early childhood was observed in a cohort of 131 infant-mother pairs in Mancora, Peru (Marsh et al. 1995b). The mean concentration of mercury in maternal hair was determined to be 8. 3 ppm (range, 1.2-30 ppm), and the source of the mercury was believed to be from consumption of marine fish. Similarly, a study of 583 Faroe Island infants for the first 12 months after birth found no decrease in the age of attainment of sitting, creeping (crawling), and standing developmental milestones (Grandjean et al. 1995a ). The age at which a child reached a particular developmental milestone was not only not found to be associated with prenatal mercury exposure, but infants that reached a milestone early were found to ha ve significantly higher mercury concentrations in their hair at 12 months of age. It was also found that early milestone attainment was clearly associated withbreast-feeding, which was in turn related to higher infant hair mercury levels. The authors (Grandjean et al. 1995a) concluded that the beneficial effects associ ated with breast-feeding seemed to overrule, or to compensate for, any neurotoxic effects on milestone development that could be due to the presence ofcontaminants (e.g., mercury) in human milk. Additional studies have shown developm ental toxicity after oral exposure of humans and animals to organic mercury compounds (Amin-Zaki et al. 1974; Bakir et al. 1972; Boush 1975; Snyder and Seelinger 1976; Stoltenburg-Didinger and Markwort 1990). The accumulation of mercury is greater in larger fish a nd in fish higher in the food chain. The tendency for increased mercury concentration with increasing fish body weight is particularly noticeable in carnivorous fish species. Malm et al. (1995) analyzed mercury c oncentrations in 16 species of carnivorous fish from the Tapajos River basin in Brazil and hair samples from local populations who regularly ate such fish. Mercury levels in the fish averaged 0.55 ppm (range, 0.04-3.77 ppm), and the mercury levels in the hair of the affected fish-eating populations averaged approximate ly 25 ppm. In one population that consumed higher quantities of large carnivorous fish at the end of the local rainy season, 8 of 29 persons evaluated had hair mercury levels above 40 ppm, and one individual had a hair mercur y concentration of 151 ppm. Some villages along the river can have per capita daily fish consumption rates around 200 g or more, which would greatly impact the human body burden and hair levels of mercury in such populations. MERCURY A-23 APPENDIX A Alternative Derivations of the MRL To ensure a health guidance value based upon the best use of the Seychelles study data (widely considered the most relevant data available), ATSDR evaluated alternate MRL derivation methods for methylmercury. One such method was a physiologically based pharmacokine tic approach using the mean total mercury level of 6.8 ppm in maternal hair for the entire Seychellois study cohort. Using the same formula as in theprevious MRL calculation, C = (0.95 x 0.05 x d) / (0.014 x 4.2) C = 0.81 d(1/250 x 6.8) mg/L = 0.81 mg/day0.034 mg/day / 60 kg = 0.0006 mg/kg/day In consideration of uncertainty factors for this MRL appr oach, multiple factors also apply. In this case, the mean value of 6.8 ppm for the NOAEL is for the entire study cohort at 66 months (n = 711). An uncertaintyfactor of 1.5 was used to account for the pharmacoki netically based variability of hair-to-blood ratios (95% confidence level) in pregnant women and fetuses in the U.S. population (Clewell et al. 1998, 1999). The extremely large size of the study population (n=711), in combination with an uncertainty factor of 1.5, isconsidered adequate to encompass the full range of pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic variability within the human population. An independent modify ing factor of 1.5 was also used to take into consideration the positive results of the domain-specific tests administered in the Faroe study (Grandjean et al. 1997, 1998). The uncertainty factor of 1.5, multiplied by the modifying factor of 1.5, yields a totalaggregate value of 2.25. Applying the factor of 2. 25 to the daily intake calculated from the 6.8 ppm NOAEL yields a chronic oral MRL value of 0.0003 mg/kg/ day for methylmercury (0.0006 mg/kg/day divided by 2.25 = 0.0003 mg/kg/day). A third approach to deriving a health guidance va lue is the use of bench mark dose (BMD) modeling. Clewell et al. (1998) used a benchmark dose analysis to determine a reference dose (RfD, a health guidance value used by the Environmental Protection Agency and, in some ways, the equivalent of ATSDR's chronic oral MRL). Clewell et al. (1998) used the data from the 29-month test in the Seychellois population (Davidson et al. 1995b) for their analysis (i.e., the 66-m onth study had not been published at the time of their benchmark dose analysis). The BMD is calculated by fitting a mathematical dose-response model to dose- response data. The bench mark dose level (BMDL) is a lower statistical confidence bound on the BMD and replaces the NOAEL in the calculation of a health guidan ce value. The BMD appro ach has been proposed as superior to the use of \"average\" or \"grouped\" exposure estimates when dose-response information is available, as is the case for the Seychelles study. Clewell et al. (1998) note that the Faroe Islands studyreported by Grandjean et al. (1997b) could not be used for dose-response modeling due to inadequate reporting of the data and the confounding influence of co-exposure to PCBs. For the 29-month Seychelles data, Clewell et al. (1998) used the 95% lower bound on the 10% benchmark dose level (BMDL), which represents a conservative estimate of the traditional NOAEL. The benchmark dose modeling over the entire range of neurological e ndpoints reported by Davidson et al. (1995b) yielded a lowest BMDL 10 of 21 ppm methylmercury in maternal hair. This BMDL10 was then converted to an expected distribution of daily ingestion rates across a population of U.S. women of child-bearing age byusing a Monte Carlo analysis with a physiol ogically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model of methylmercury developed by Gearhart et al. (1995). This analysis addresses the impact of interindividualMERCURY A-24 APPENDIX A pharmacokinetic variability on the rela ingestion rate a nd hair concentration for methyl- mercury. The resulting distribution had a geometri c mean value of 0.00160 mg/kg/day (S.D. 0.00133). The 1st, 5th, and 10th ribution were 0.00086, 0.00104, and 0.00115 mg/kg/day, respectively. Clewell et al. (1998) suggested th at the 5th percentile of 0.00104 mg/kg/day provides a scientifically based, conservative b asis that incorporates the pharmacokinetic variability across the U.S. population of child-bearing women and that no other uncer tainty factor for interindividual variability would be needed. To the benchmark-estimated NOAEL of 21 ppm derived from the Seychelles 29-month data, Clewell et al. (1998) applied an uncertainty factor of 3 to account for data base limitations. (Note: The 66-month Seychelles data was not yet published at th e time; hence the reliance on the 29-month Seychelles data for the benchmark analysis.) Consequently, Clewell et al. (1998) concluded that using a NOAEL of 7 ppm (21 ppm / 3 (UF) provides additional protection against the possibility that effects could occur atlower concentrations in some populations. Based upon this reasoning, they recommended a health guidance value (i.e., an RfD) of 0.0004 mg/kg/day. If a modifying factor of 1.5 is used to further address the domain-specific findings in the Faroe study, a final MRL of 0.3 \u00b5g/kg/day results. The above benchmark analysis of 29-month data fro m the Seychelles Child Development Study strongly supports the MRL of 0.0003 mg/kg/day calculated by A TSDR in this profile. Similarly, addressing the Seychellois 66-month data from the pe rspective of using the mean value (15.3 ppm) of the highest exposure group in the study, a method prescribed in ATSDR's published guidance for MRL development (Chou et al. 1998), also results in an identical MRL. ATSDR theref ore has high confidence that this level is protective of the health of all potentially exposed human populations. Agency Contact (Chemical Manager) : John F. RisherMERCURY B-1 APPENDIX B USER'S GUIDE Chapter 1 Public Health Statement This chapter of the profile is a health effects summary written in non-technical language. Its intended audience is the general public especially people living in the vicinity of a hazardous waste site or chemical release. If the Public Health Statement were re moved from the rest of the document, it would still communicate to the lay public essential information about the chemical. The major headings in the Public H ealth Statement are useful to find specific topics of concern. The topics are written in a question and answer format. The answ er to each question includes a sentence that will direct the reader to chapters in the profile that will provide more information on the given topic. Chapter 2 Tables and Figures for Levels of Significant Exposure (LSE) Tables (2-1, 2-2, and 2-3) and figures (2-1 and 2-2) are used to summarize health effects and illustrate graphically levels of exposure associated with those e ffects. These levels cover health effects observed at increasing dose concentrations and durations, differences in response by species, minimal risk levels (MRLs) to humans for noncancer end points, and EPA's estim ated range associated with an upper- bound individual lifetime cancer risk of 1 in 10,000 to 1 in 10,000,000. Use the LSE tables and figures for a quick review ofthe health effects and to locate data for a speci fic exposure scenario. The LSE tables and figures should always be used in conjunction with the text. A ll entries in these tables and figures represent studies that provide reliable, quantitative estimates of No-O bserved-Adverse- Effect Levels (NOAELs), Lowest-Observed-Adverse-Effect Levels (L OAELs), or Cancer Effect Levels (CELs). The legends presented below demonstrate the appli cation of these tables and figures. Representative examples of LSE Table 2-1 and Figure 2-1 are shown. The numbers in the left column of the legends correspond to the numbers in the example table and figure. LEGEND See LSE Table 2-1 (1) Route of Exposure One of the first considerations when re viewing the toxicity of a substance using these tables and figures should be the relevant and appr opriate route of exposure. When sufficient data exists, three LSE tables and two LSE figures are presented in the document. The three LSE tablespresent data on the three principal routes of exposure, i.e., inhalation, oral, and dermal (LSE Table 2-1, 2-2, and 2-3, respectively). LSE figures are limited to the inhalation (LSE Figure 2-1) and oral (LSE Figure 2-2) routes. Not all substances will have da ta on each route of exposure and will not therefore have all five of the tables and figures.MERCURY B-2 APPENDIX B (2) Exposure Period Three exposure periods - acute (less than 15 days), intermediate (15-364 days), and chronic (365 days or more) are presented within each re levant route of exposure. In this example, an inhalation study of intermediate e xposure duration is reported. For qui ck reference to health effects occurring from a known length of exposure, locate the applicable exposure period within the LSE table and figure. (3) Health Effect The major categories of health effects included in LSE tables and figures are death, systemic, immunological, neurological, developm ental, reproductive, and cancer. NOAELs and LOAELs can be reported in the tables and figures for all effects but cancer. Systemic effects arefurther defined in the \"System\" column of the LSE table (see key number 18). (4) Key to Figure Each key number in the LSE table links study information to one or more data points using the same key number in the corresponding LSE figure. In this example, the study represented bykey number 18 has been used to derive a NOAEL and a Less Serious LOAEL (also see the 2 \"18r\" data points in Figure 2-1). (5) Species The test species, whether animal or human, are identified in this column. Section 2.5, \"Relevance to Public Health,\" covers the relevance of animal data to human toxicity and Section 2.3, \"Toxicokinetics,\" contains any available inform ation on comparative toxicokinetics. Although NOAELs and LOAELs are species specific, the levels are extrapolated to equivalent human doses to derive an MRL. (6) Exposure Frequency/Duration The duration of the study and the weekly and daily exposure regimen are provided in this column. This permits comparison of NOAELs and LOAELs from different studies. In this case (key number 18), rats were expo sed to 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethane via inhalation for 6 hours per day, 5 days per week, for 3 weeks. Fo r a more complete review of the dosing regimen refer to the appropriate sections of the text or the original reference paper, i.e., Nitschke et al. 1981. (7) System This column further defines the systemic effects. These systems include: respiratory, cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, hematological, muscu loskeletal, hepatic, renal, and \"Other\" refers to any systemic effect (e.g., a decr ease in body weight) not covered in these systems. In the example of key number 18, 1 systemic effect (respiratory) was investigated. (8) NOAEL A No-Observed-Adverse-Effect Level (NOAEL) is the highest exposure level at which no harmful effects were seen in the organ system st udied. Key number 18 reports a NOAEL of 3 ppm for the respiratory system which was used to deri ve an intermediate exposure, inhalation MRL of 0.005 footnote \"b\"). (9) LOAEL A Lowest-Observed-Adverse-Effect Level (LOA EL) is the lowest dose used in the study that caused a harmful health effect. LOAELs have been classified into \"Less Serious\" and \"Serious\" effects. These distinctions help readers identify the levels of exposure at which adverse health effects first appear and the gradation of effects with increasing dose. A brief description of the specific endpoint used to quantify the adverse effect accompan ies the LOAEL. The respiratory effect reported in key number 18 (hyperplasia) is a Less serious LOAEL of 10 ppm. MRLs are not derived from Serious LOAELs. (10) Reference The complete reference citation is given in chapter 8 of the profile.MERCURY B-3 APPENDIX B (11) CEL A Cancer Effect Level (CEL) is the low est exposure level associated with the onset of carcinogenesis in experimental or epidemiologic studies. CELs are always considered serious effects. The LSE tables and figures do not contain NOAELs for cancer, but the text may report doses notcausing measurable cancer increases. (12) Footnotes Explanations of abbreviations or referen ce notes for data in the LSE tables are found in the footnotes. Footnote \"b\" indicates the NOAEL of 3 ppm in key number 18 was used to derive an MRLof 0.005 ppm. LEGEND See Figure 2-1 LSE figures graphically illustrate the data presented in the corresponding LSE tables. Figures help the reader quickly compare health effects according to e xposure concentrations for pa rticular exposure periods. (13) Exposure Period The same exposure periods appear as in the LSE table. In this example, health effects observed within the intermediate and chronic exposure periods are illustrated. (14) Health Effect These are the categories of health effects fo r which reliable quantitative data exists. The same health effects appear in the LSE table. (15) Levels of Exposure concentrations or doses for each health effect in the LSE tables are graphically displayed in the LSE figures. Exposure concentration or dose is measured on the log scale \"y\" axis. Inhalation exposure is reported in mg/m 3 or ppm and oral exposure is reported in mg/kg/day. (16) NOAEL In this example, 18r NOAEL is the critical endpoint for which an intermediate inhalation exposure MRL is based. As you can see from the LSE figure key, the open-circle symbol indicates toa NOAEL for the test species-rat. The key number 18 corresponds to the entry in the LSE table. The dashed descending arrow indicates the extrapolation from the exposure level of 3 ppm (see entry 18 inthe Table) to the MRL of 0.005 ppm (see footnote \"b\" in the LSE table). (17) CEL Key number 38r is 1 of 3 studies for which Can cer Effect Levels were derived. The diamond symbol refers to a Cancer Effect Level for the test species-mouse. The number 38 corresponds to the entry in the LSE table. (18) Estimated Upper-Bound Human Cancer Risk Levels This is the range associated with the upper-bound for lifetime cancer risk of 1 in 10,000 to 1 in 10,000,000. These risk levels are derived from the EPA'sHuman Health Assessment Group's upper-bound estimates of the slope of the cancer dose responsecurve at low dose levels (q 1*).

This summary is designed to present interpretive, weight-of-evidence discussions for human health end points by addressing the following questions. 1. What effects are known to occur in humans?2. What effects observed in animals are likely to be of concern to humans?3. What exposure conditions are likely to be of concern to humans, especially around hazardous waste sites? The section covers end points in the same order they appear within the Discussion of Health Effects by Route of Exposure section, by route (inhalation, oral, de rmal) and within route by effect. Human data are presented first, then animal data. Both are orga nized by duration (acute, intermediate, chronic). In vitro data and data from parenteral routes (intramuscular, intrave nous, subcutaneous, etc.) are also considered in this section. If data are located in the scientific litera ture, a table of genotoxicity information is included. The carcinogenic potential of the profiled substance is qualitatively evaluated, when appropriate, using existing toxicokinetic, genotoxic, and carcinogenic data. ATSDR does not currently assess cancer potency or perform cancer risk assessments. Minimal risk leve ls (MRLs) for noncancer end points (if derived) and the end points from which they were derived are indicated and discussed. Limitations to existing scientific literature that prev ent a satisfactory evaluation of the relevance to public health are identified in the Data Needs section. Interpretation of Minimal Risk Levels Where sufficient toxicologic information is available, we have derived minimal risk levels (MRLs) for inhalation and oral routes of entry at each duration of exposure (acute, intermediate, and chronic). These MRLs are not meant to support regulatory action; but to acquaint health professionals with exposure levels at which adverse health effects are not expected to o ccur in humans. They should help physicians and public health officials determine the safety of a community liv ing near a chemical emission, given the concentration of a contaminant in air or the estimated daily dose in water. MRLs are based largely on toxicological studies in animals and on reports of human occupational exposure. MRL users should be familiar with the toxicologic in formation on which the number is based. Chapter 2.5, \"Relevance to Public Health,\" contains basic informa tion known about the substance. Other sections such as 2.8, \"Interactions with Other Substances,\" and 2.9, \"Populations that are Unusually Susceptible\" provide important supplemental information. MRL users should also understand the MRL derivation methodology. MRLs are derived using a modified version of the risk assessment methodology the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) provides (Barnesand Dourson 1988) to determine referen ce doses for lifetime exposure (RfDs). MERCURY B-7 APPENDIX B To derive an MRL, ATSDR generally selects the most sensitive endpoint which, in its best judgement, represents the most sensitive human health effect fo r a given exposure route and duration. ATSDR cannot make this judgement or derive an MRL unless informa tion (quantitative or qualitative) is available for all potential systemic, neurological, and developmental effect s. If this information and reliable quantitative data on the chosen endpoint are available, ATSDR deri ves an MRL using the most sensitive species (when information from multiple species is available) with the highest NOAEL that does not exceed any adverse effect levels. When a NOAEL is not available, a low est-observed-adverse-effect level (LOAEL) can be used to derive an MRL, and an uncertainty factor (UF) of 10 must be employed. Additional uncertainty factors of 10 must be used both for human variability to protect sensitive subpopulations (people who are most susceptible to the health effects cau sed by the substance) and for inte rspecies variability (extrapolation from animals to humans). In deriving an MRL, these indivi dual uncertainty factors are multiplied together. The product is then divided into the inhalation concentra tion or oral dosage selected from the study. Uncertainty factors used in developing a substance-specific MRL are provided in the footnotes of the LSE Tables..MERCURY C-1 APPENDIX C ACRONYMS, ABBREVIATIONS, AND SYMBOLS ACGIH American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists ADI Acceptable Daily IntakeADME Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, and ExcretionAFID alkali flame ionization detectorAFOSH Air Force Office of Safety and HealthAML acute myeloid leukemiaAOAC Association of Official Analytical Chemistsatm atmosphereATSDR Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease RegistryAWQC Ambient Water Quality CriteriaBAT Best Available TechnologyBCF bioconcentration factorBEI Biological Exposure IndexBSC Board of Scientific CounselorsC CentigradeCAA Clean Air ActCAG Cancer Assessment Group of the U.S. Environmental Protection AgencyCAS Chemical Abstract ServicesCDC Centers for Disease Control and PreventionCEL Cancer Effect LevelCELDS Computer-Environmental Legislative Data SystemCERCLA Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability ActCFR Code of Federal RegulationsCi curieCL ceiling limit valueCLP Programcm centimeterCML leukemiaCNS central nervous CommissionCWA Clean Water Actdd a yDerm dermalDHEW Department of Health, Education, and WelfareDHHS Department of Health and Human ServicesDNA deoxyribonucleic acidDOD Department of DefenseDOE Department of EnergyDOL Department LaborDOT of Transportation/United NA/IMCO North America/Inte rnational Drinking Water Exposure LevelMERCURY C-2 APPENDIX C ECD electron capture detection ECG/EKG Exposure Guidance LevelEPA Environmental Protection AgencyF FahrenheitF 1 first-filial generation FAO Food and Agricultural Organization of the United NationsFDA Food and Drug AdministrationFEMA Federal Emergency Management high resolution gas chromatographyHSDB Hazardous Substance Data Bank IDLH Immediately Dangerous to Life and HealthIARC International Agency for Research on CancerILO International Labor Organizationin inchIRIS Integrated partition coefficient L literLC liquid chromatographyLC Lo lethal concentration, low LC50 lethal concentration, 50% kill LDLo lethal dose, low LD50 lethal dose, 50% kill LT50 lethal time, 50% kill lowest-observed-adverse-effect levelLSE Levels of millimeters mercurymmol millimolemo particles per cubic footMRL Minimal Risk LevelMS mass spectrometryNAAQS National Ambient Air Quality StandardNAS National Academy of ScienceNATICH National Air Toxics Information ClearinghouseNATO North Atlantic Treaty OrganizationNCE normochromatic erythrocytesNCI National Cancer InstituteNIEHS National Institute of Environmental Health SciencesNIOSH National Institute for O ccupational Safety and Health NIOSHTIC NIOSH's Computerized Information Retrieval SystemNFPA National Fire Protection Associationng nanogramNLM National Library of Medicinenm National Health and Examination Surveynmol nanomoleNOAEL no-observed-adverse-effect levelNOES National Occupational Exposure SurveyNOHS National Occupational SurveyNPD nitrogen phosphorus detectionNPDES National Pollutant Discharge Elimination SystemNPL National Priorities ListNR not reportedNRC National Research CouncilNS not specifiedNSPS New Source Performance StandardsNTIS National Technical Information ServiceNTP National Toxicology ProgramODW Office of Drinking Water, EPAOERR Office of Emergency and Remedial Response, EPAOHM/TADS Oil and Hazardous Materials/Technical Assistance Data SystemOPP Office of Pesticide Programs, EPAOPPTS Office of Prevention, Pesticides and Toxic Substances, EPAOPPT Office of Pollution Prevention and Toxics, EPAOSHA Occupational Safety and Health AdministrationOSW Office of Solid Waste, EPAOTS Office of Toxic SubstancesOW Office of WaterOWRS Office of Water Regulations and Standards, EPAMERCURY C-4 APPENDIX parts per millionppt parts per trillionPSNS Pretreatment Standards for level/limitRfC Reference ConcentrationRfD Reference DoseRNA ribonucleic of Toxic Effects of Chemical SubstancesRQ Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization ActSCE Industrial ClassificationSIM Secondary Maximum Contaminant LevelSMR standard mortality ratioSNARL Suggested No Adverse Response LevelSPEGL Short-Term Public Emergency Guidance LevelSTEL short-term exposure limitSTORET Storage and RetrievalTD 50 toxic dose, 50% specific toxic effect TLV threshold limit valueTOC Total Organic CompoundTPQ Threshold Planning QuantityTRI Toxics Release InventoryTSCA Toxic Substances Control Toxics Release Organic Compoundyr yearWHO World Health Organizationwk week > greater than > greater than or equal to = equal toMERCURY C-5 APPENDIX C < less than < less than or equal to % percent alpha beta gamma delta \u00b5m micrometer\u00b5g microgramq 1* cancer slope factor - negative+ positive(+) weakly positive result(-) weakly negative result.
