It was developed primarily for teachers, yet it includes information that may be useful for administrators and other stake holders in their efforts to plan for and implement the new Spanish program of studies. The grade level samples provided in Chapter 8 are designed to give teacher s a clearer idea of what the outcomes in the program of studies mean and to offe r some sample ideas on how to teach to those outcomes. The samples are not mean t to be read or used chronologically. The activities cover a range of degrees of diffi culty, and it is expected that teachers will adapt the samples in this guide to reflect the needs and interests of their students. Familiarity with the program of studies is essential as teachers plan and implement language courses in their classrooms. The program of studies provides a brief discussion of the value of learning a second language and lays out learning outcomes for each grade level. It defines what students are expected to achieve and, hence, what teachers are expected to teach. To obtain the current version of the program of studies, visit the Alberta Education Web site at http://education.alberta.ca/teacher s/program/interlang/spanish.aspx . This guide to implementation will assist educators as they: develop further understanding of the program of studies Chapter 1 Introduction 2 / Chapter 1 Spanish Language and Culture 9Y Guide to Implementation (7-9) 2010 Alberta Education, Alberta, Canada plan for meeting the need s of diverse learners plan for the use of technology in the delivery of the new program communicate with stakeholders, such as parents and community members plan for instruction and assessment that support student achievement of the learning outcomes monitor student progress in ac hieving the learning outcomes select learning resources to support their own professional development select student learning resources to enhance instruction and assessment. Research of second language learning and acquisition has identified several general principles of effective language learning. These principles guided the development of the conceptual model used in the program of studies. A clear understanding of these principles will provide a strong founda tion for teachers as they develop and select teaching and learning strategies for classroom implementation. Engaging Students in Meaningful Tasks Language learning is more effective when classes are structured around meaningful tasks rather than elements of the language itself, such as gra mmatical structures, vocabulary themes or language functions . The principal focus of classroom activities is on communication while learning about a content area (e.g., parts of the body) or while carrying out a project (e.g., planning a family vacation). Specific language skills are taught when students r ealize they need specific vocabulary, structures or functions to carry out the task they have chosen to do. When language learning has purpose, students tend to be more motivated to learn. Maximizing Student Interaction Students learn languages more effectively when they have ample opportunities to work in small groups on tasks that they have had a hand in choosing and that require them to negotiate meaning; i.e ., make themselves understood and work to understand others. In classrooms structured with a maximum amount of student interaction, students have more practi ce time, they are given some choice in working on tasks that reflect their interest s, and they use the language in situations that more closely resemble those outside of the classroom. Ensuring Student Awareness and Use of Thinking and Learning Strategies Successful language learners use a number of cognitive, metacognitive and social/affective strategies that help make their learning more effective. Communication and language use strategies are important to the development of communicative competence and are clearly laid out in the \"Strategies\" section of the program of studies. For more information ... Spanish Language and Culture Nine-year Program, Grades 7-8-9 Spanish Language and Culture 9Y Guide to Implementation (7-9) Chapter 1 / 3 Alberta Education, Alberta, Canada 2010 Because all students do not instinctively use language learning strategies, many students benefit from explicit classroom instruction regarding language learning and language use strategies. Once students are aware of the various strategies, have reflected on their usefulness and have practised them, they can select the most effective ones for a particular task. By using strategies they have selected, students see the link between their own actions and their learning and become more motivated and more effective language learners. Building on Prior Knowledge The constructivist theory of learning suggests that people learn by integrating new information or experiences into what th ey already know and have experienced. Students do this most effectively through active engagement with tasks that are meaningful to them, in authentic contexts, using actual tools. For this reason, the content and tasks around which lessons and units are structured should be chosen from within the students' areas of experience. For example, if students are involved and interested in a particular social activity, a task can be chosen that links with this interest. The learning activities will build on the students' knowledge and experience while encourag ing them to increase their understanding and broaden their horizons. Students come to their language learning experiences with unique sets of prior knowledge, even if they have similar cu ltural and socioeconomic backgrounds. Classroom activities that provide choice a nd flexibility allow students to make meaningful connections and to be activ ely involved in constructing their own learning. Transferring First Language Knowledge Students come to their language and cult ure classes with large bodies of useful knowledge about language, even if they ha ve never spoken a word of the language being taught. They can transfer knowle dge of their first language and other languages to their learning of a new langua ge. They may also transfer language learning and language use strategies from one language context to another. Initially, the first language may also be a source of interference as students try to apply generalizations valid for their dom inant language to the language they are learning. Students benefit from an aw areness of both similarities and differences between their first language and the lang uage being learned in terms of all components of language; e.g., sound system, grammar structures, vocabulary and discourse features. Understanding the Culture Intercultural competence is an essential element of any language-learning endeavour. Knowledge of the target cultu re must take into account that cultures evolve over time and minority cultures ex ist within the dominant culture in any society. If students develop the skills to analyze, understand for themselves and relate to any culture they come in contact with, they will be prepared for encounters with cultural practices that have not been dealt with in class. 4 / Chapter 1 Spanish Language and Culture 9Y Guide to Implementation (7-9) 2010 Alberta Education, Alberta, Canada Learning about the target culture in the second language classroom also allows students to develop deeper awareness of their own culture as well as other world cultures. With a greater awareness of th e cultural diversity in our world, students become more respectful of people of different backgrounds who speak other languages. It is hoped that cultural lear ning within second lang uage education will help create long-term positive effects on Alberta's students, including development of empathy toward people of different et hnic backgrounds and appreciation for the linguistic and cultural make-up of the Canadian people. Understanding the Learner The Nature of Grade 7 to Grade 9 Learners The Spanish Language and Culture Nine-year Program, Grade 4 to Grade 12, is a student-centred curriculum designed to support the language learning of students in Alberta. The unique characteristics and needs of these students formed the basis for curriculum development. Language learning is an active process that begins at birth and continues throughout life. Language is acquired at various rates and in different ways throughout a learner's stages of growth, developing progressively according to individual characteristics and criteria. Students enhance their language abilities by applying their knowledge of language in new and more complex contexts with ever-increasing sophistication. They refl ect on and use prior knowledge to extend and enhance their language knowledge and understanding. Language and literacy learning at the Grade 7 to Grade 9 level requires a unique classroom culture and climate that is di fferent from that required for younger and older students. Students at Grade 7 to Grade 9 are distinguished by special intellectual, moral, physical, emotional, psychological and social characteristics that shape the way they learn. The methods, contexts, resources and supports chosen by teachers should be influenced by the needs, characteristics and interests of their individual students, and so the teachers' styles, attitudes and pacing may vary from classroom to classroom. Students in grades 7 to 9 bring a wide range of abilities and characteristics with them to the classroom. As well, these learners are experiencing a period of change and developmental growth. Self-concept and self-esteem play important roles in their learning. Positive reinforcement, r ecognition, acceptance by adults and peers, and support of developing personal independence all play significant roles in promoting the students' learning. Learners in grades 7 to 9 typically prefer active learning and interaction with their peers during learning experiences. They also respond positively to real-life contexts and situations. It is during grad es 7 to 9 that learners demonstrate ability to use abstract thinking in order to unde rstand and to use conceptual reasoning in order to take meaning from hypothetical situations. Spanish Language and Culture 9Y Guide to Implementation (7-9) Chapter 1 / 5 Alberta Education, Alberta, Canada 2010 The grades 7 to 9 learner typically responds well to learning environments that promote teamwork and a sense of belonging for each individual. Consistent reward through positive reinforcement is required in order to make every student feel accepted for his or her contribution to the classroom environment. Equally important to the sense of belonging is the need for the grades 7 to 9 learner to feel like, and be treated as, a unique individu al. Creating or facilitating opportunities for students to express their personal preferences with peers supports the development of learner individuality. Grades 7 to 9 learners are also in the process of developing a sense of accountability for their actions, choices and decisions. Allowing students to make choices and decisions within the boundaries of the learning environment helps them to be aware of the natural conse quences of their actions. Providing young adolescent learners with freedom of choice within the realistic realms of the second language program also motivates students and facilitates their learning. Since decision making can be a difficult process fo r some students at the grades 7 to 9 level, guidelines and frameworks should be provided by the teacher. At the grades 7 to 9 level, young adolescent l earners begin to experiment with roles as active or passive participants and with th e types of contributions they will add to the social make-up of the classroom. This is a good time for students to experiment with leadership roles and with roles as facilitators and recorders when working in groups or when participating in whole-class activities guided by the teacher. Students at the grades 7 to 9 level tend to favour educational activities that require cooperative participation from their p eers mixed with a certain degree of competition. In this case, educational games where students compete in teams by applying the new concepts prove to be a highly effective tool for the classroom. In this situation, young adolescent learners are engaged in enjoyable activities that induce alertness and that are low stress, where learning is maximized, storage of information is prolonged and recall is facilitated. Adolescent learners at the grades 7 to 9 level also show a tendency to seek activities that have a \"high thrill payoff\"; research found that the central nervous system of adolescents functions with a hi gher level of dopamine, a neurotransmitter connected to pleasure and movement. Th is may result in a greater need for stimulation by movement and risk-taking. With this in mind, use of kinaesthetic activities and games that engage learne rs through movement can become a powerful teaching strategy. It is important throughout to sustain a fair atmosphere in the classroom. Research also shows that learning is in creased when the student is challenged but not threatened by the activity. It is n ecessary for the teacher to select activities at the appropriate difficulty level in order to challenge students in a motivating way. Selection of age-appropriate supporting mate rial is also very important for the grades 7 to 9 learner. 6 / Chapter 1 Spanish Language and Culture 9Y Guide to Implementation (7-9) 2010 Alberta Education, Alberta, Canada Grades 7 to 9 learners retain informati on most efficiently when they can make connections between what they are learning in the classroom and the real world outside. Instruction that is delivered th rough thematic contexts that are usually project-oriented and focus on task-based lear ning tend to give students the greatest connections between classroom learning and real-world applications. Researchers find that people of all ages learn best by solving realistic problems. It is important for teachers to allow students to experime nt with the concepts through real-life simulations. Student learning is also enhanced when students are given opportunities to participate in activities that impact others outside of the class, such as individuals in the community. The classroom teacher plays an influential role in the learning process of students at the grades 7 to 9 level. These students learn behaviours and gain information by observing the teacher and his or her behaviour. Students also seem to excel in the learning process when they are effectively connected to their learning environment\u2014the educator, their peers and the content of the program. The Second Language Learner The program of studies meets the needs of a wide range of learners. Currently, most students enter this program in Grad e 4 with little or no previous exposure to the Spanish language. Most of these st udents speak English as a first language within an English language majority environment; however, students also enter this program with a variety of language skills and experiences. For example, some enter with strong cultural knowledge and higher proficiency in listening and speaking Spanish but little proficiency in reading and writing. Occasionally, students will enter this program with little or no English or Spanish language proficiency. More frequently, students with proficiency in French as a second language as well as experience with the gr ammatical structure found in Romance languages will enter the program. Therefor e, a diverse range of student language abilities exists in Spanish language and culture classrooms. The Spanish Language and Culture Nine-y ear Program was developed with the assumption that the majority of students entering the program at the Grade 7 level would have had some degree of exposure to the Spanish language in grades 4 to 6. The degree of exposure to the language also depends on the amount of time awarded by the school for the learning of Spanish, the language proficiency of the teacher, as well as student and teacher access to resources such as textbooks, workbooks, videos, listening CDs, CD-R OMs and language labs. When planning instruction, teachers need to consider the unique needs, characteristics and influences that affect their students as second language learners. Second language learning is influenced by many factors that can be broadly categorized into three main areas: Spanish Language and Culture 9Y Guide to Implementation (7-9) Chapter 1 / 7 Alberta Education, Alberta, Canada 2010 Outside Influences These include social, economic, cultural and political influences. For example, the importance placed by the family and the community on the language being learned, as well as the availability of opportunities to use the language meaningfully outside the classroom, are both factors that can influence the acquisition of a second language. Classroom Factors Important classroom-based factors that impact second language learning include instructional organization, such as the amount of time spent conversing in the second language, the quality of the language input and class size. Teaching styles, methodologies and approaches are also key classroom factors. Personal Characteristics Personal characteristics include individual di fferences that can impact the rate and quality of an individual's se cond language acquisition. Elements such as previous knowledge and experiences with the first language, Spanish or other languages can have a significant impact on a student's future learning of a new language. Personal characteristics such as the age at which the student began learning the second language, the student's aptitude for learning languages, as well as the student's motivation, attitude toward learning the language and learning preferences are also contributing factors. Other personality variables, such as anxiety levels, self-esteem, self-concept and social skills, have also been thought to influence second language acquisition. Factors that Influence Multilingual Development There are a number of individual factors that impact students and their capacity to learn an additional language. These factors are beyond the control of the teacher or school, but they are important to consider as they help explain why students acquire language at different rates. Tr acey Tokuhama-Espinosa (2001) identifies 10 key factors that impact individual l earners. The following are nine of these factors that are most relevant for language learners in junior high school settings: Instructional Time Consistent exposure to the target langua ge through all four parts of language skill/proficiency\u2014 listening, reading, speaking and writing\u2014is necessary for second-language acquisition to occur with a dolescent learners. The amount of time spent learning a second language also impacts linguistic development. Research shows that fluency in a second language is not attainable with a mere 95 hours of language instruction per year for a period of six years; a greater amount of instructional time is needed for functional b ilingualism to occur. With this in mind, it is essential for the second language teacher to focus on communicative activities that promote fluency as often as possible. The teacher also needs to encourage students to seek opportunities outside of the classroom to use the language; e.g., watching movies in Spanish, or with Spanish subtitles, or dining at restaurants. 8 / Chapter 1 Spanish Language and Culture 9Y Guide to Implementation (7-9) 2010 Alberta Education, Alberta, Canada Aptitude Second-language acquisition is influenced by the personal nature of the learner. While it is clear that every student is bor n with an inherent aptitude for different kinds of learning, those with strong cogn itive traits such as risk-taking, verbal communication and music abilities seem to display greater aptitude for learning a second language. While educators cannot influence how much aptitude a student has, they can use other factors to motivate and engage the learner. Timing Research has found that second-language acquisition differs according to the age of the learner. The learning process follows a different pattern when the learner begins at the age of 5, 15 or 25. Researchers argue that the critical learning periods marked by puberty change the way in which learning a second language is processed in the brain. Younger learners acquire both grammar and pronunciation \"naturally,\" while older adolescents and a dults show tendencies of using conscious, analytical thinking skills to understand and be able to apply grammatical concepts. Nevertheless, the learner's brain after pu berty still shows flexibility and plasticity as the student consciously learns new vocabulary and semantics of language. Since the stage of brain development and puberty play a role in language learning, classroom teachers may find that younger learners (elementary and some early Grade 7 learners) are able to acquire la nguage by merely listening and repeating while the older (late Grade 9 learners) n eed to have explanations of language function followed by examples and opportunities to apply the concepts in guided situations. Second language teachers need to plan th eir lessons accordingly. For younger learners, it is recommended to expose the student to the language as much as possible without causing stress. Teaching vocabulary and basic grammar can be done informally in the second language as it is absorbed by the learner. It is recommended, however, to teach more complex grammatical structures in the native language to avoid stressing the learner. A similar example involves pronunciation. Younger learners are able to learn how to enunciate words more accurately with less effort in comparison to older learners. Educators who emphasize perfect pronunciation with older learners can cause more stress, which can inhibit these learners from taking risks a nd trying to use new vocabulary. It is argued that the greater the emphasis the educator puts on accurate use of language, the less fluent the learner becomes in a given time. Educators who concentrate on the use of language for communicating a message as a whole end up promoting fluency over accuracy. Motivation Students' readiness to learn another lan guage is partially dependent on their motivation and on internal and external fact ors, such as how a student feels about the language being learned and the attitu de of other significant persons; e.g., parents, teachers and peers. Positive ex periences with, and positive perceptions of, the second language serve to increase motivation. Planning In her research, Tokuhama-Espinosa found th at learners in families that had a well- developed plan to provide good language learning opportunities were more successful in developing bilingual language skills. In a school setting, it is equally important that an effective instructional plan be in place to implement a language and culture program. Spanish Language and Culture 9Y Guide to Implementation (7-9) Chapter 1 / 9 Alberta Education, Alberta, Canada 2010 Consistency Second language students exposed to language learning opportunities in a consistent and continuous fashion are most successful. In schools, it is important to schedule language and culture programs in a way that provides for well-sequenced and consistent language learning opportunities. Opportunity A student may have great motivation, but without the opportunity to practise a second language in meaningful situations, he or she never becomes truly proficient. It is important that sufficient time be allocated for language and culture programs during the school day. Students and parents can supplement and enhance classroom language learning by seeking out or building opportunities for language learning in the home and in the communit y and by participating in relevant extracurricular activities. Linguistic Relationship among Languages The target language and those in which the students are already fluent may share a common historical root. If the student's first language shares roots with the second language, the second language is easier to learn because of similarities in grammar, vocabulary and sound systems and because of the ease of transfer of first language skills. Teacher awareness of the lingu istic diversity present in the classroom enables more effective responses to lear ner needs and assists in assessing student learning. Gender There is evidence that women and men u se different parts of the brain when engaged in language learning. When pla nning learning activities, teachers need to consider gender differences and ensure th at a variety of instructional approaches are used to address diverse student characteristics. Multiple Intelligences and Second Language Learning Harvard psychologist Howard Gardner (1983, 1998) has spent many years analyzing the human brain and its impact on education, including language learning. According to his research, an individual possesses multiple intelligences, but these intelligences are developed to different degrees. Gardner's Types of Intelligence Linguistic Intelligence : The ability to read, write and communicate with words. Logical-mathematical Intelligence : The ability to calculate, detect patterns, reason deductively and think logically. Visual-spatial Intelligence : The ability to master position in sp ace. This intelligence is used by architects, painters and pilots. Kinesthetic Intelligence : The ability to coordinate bodily movements. Musical Intelligence : The capacity to recognize and compose musical pitches, tones and rhythms. 10 / Chapter 1 Spanish Language and Culture 9Y Guide to Implementation (7-9) 2010 Alberta Education, Alberta, Canada Interpersonal Intelligence : The capacity to understand the intentions, motivations and desires of other people. This intelligence allows people to work effe ctively with others. Intrapersonal Intelligence : The ability to know one's inner feelings, wants and needs, and the capacity to understand oneself and to appreciate one's feelings, fears and motivations. Naturalist Intelligence : The ability to learn by exploring na ture. This intelligence enables human beings to recognize, categorize and draw upon certain features of the environment. The Possible Implications of Multiple Intelligence Theory on Second Language Teaching Learning is experiential : Students learn by engaging in real hands-on activities and tasks. Learning uses all senses : Teachers can reinforce learning with pictures and sounds, and students can learn by touching, tastin g and smelling (Dryden and Rose 1995). Learning should be fun : The more fun it is to learn a language, the more one will want to continue. Learning while playing is an effective way to learn as it creates emotional attachments, and emotion is a door to learning (Jensen 1994, Dryden and Vos 1997, Dryden and Rose 1995). Learning is best in a relaxed but challenging environment . Learning is enhanced through music and rhythm : Often one can remember the songs learned in early childhood because words co mbined with music are easier to learn (Lozanov 1978, Campbell 1997, Brewer and Campbell 1998). Learning is enhanced through action : While traditionally students were encouraged to sit all day long, we now know that students learn more when they move as they learn. Teachers can use learning strategies that include physic al interaction and can encourage students to dance and move to the rhythm when learning a language (Gardner 1983, Doman 1984, Dryden and Vos 1997). Learning is enhanced by engaging with others : Having students practise a language by talking to each other socially (e.g., over a meal) is a great way to learn (Gardner 1983, Dryden and Vos 1997).

Learning and the Brain Evidence reveals that the brain is more flexib le than previously thought. Recent findings suggest that while some functions of the brai n are fixed at birth, others are shaped by experience and learning (Genesee 2000). Mechelli et al. (2004) also found that the brain's structure changes according to the e nvironment it finds itself in. According to Sousa (2006), learning a second language enhances learning and mental competency in all subject areas as well. Furthermore, signs of cortical development in the performance of motor tasks after learning new words were s een in a study by Karni et al. (1995). The cortical map can even change in adulthood as a result of an enriched environment or learning experience (Randall 2007). It goes without saying that teaching can make a difference in brain development, and teach ers should not give up on older learners (Karni et al. 1995). Another advantage of learning a second language is that learning something new helps the brain develop by bu ilding new neural pathways and connections (Caine and Caine 1994). Teaching with the Left and Right Brain in Mind Teaching with the left and right hemispheres of the brain in mind is not enough. The two halves do not operate separately. The brain sy stem interacts together as a whole with the external world. A requirement of brain-b ased instruction is making connections within the brain and between the brain and the outside world (Genesee 2000). When learning happens, the brain works the le ft and right hemispheres, receiving input from multiple external sources su ch as auditory, visual, spatial and motor. In other words, both hemispheres work parallel to each other (Genesee 2000). Parallel processing, also known as brainswitching, is the act of playing with language by switching back and forth from the left to the right hemisphere of the brain. Two examples of this technique are the total phys ical response (TPR) and a conversation with an imaginary friend in a second language (Asher 2001). In sum, children cannot be categorized as exclusively left-brained or right-brained learners. Critical Period A sensitive period exists, usually extending up to puberty, when the brain is especially receptive to learning languages; beyond this point, the ability decreases. According to Asher (2001), students acquire near-native accent if they learn a language at a young age, usually before puberty, and they can acquire many languages with excellent pronunciation before Grade 8 if they are provided with a stress-free environment. Jean Piaget found that puberty is the most critical stage for language learning (Brown 1994, pp. 52-53), and some research suggests that the \"window of opportunity\" 14 / Chapter 1 Spanish Language and Culture 9Y Guide to Implementation (7-9) 2010 Alberta Education, Alberta, Canada closes at the time of the formative years (Herschensohn 2007). Plasticity of the brain is the highest during childhood (Hadley 2002), and as the brain develops, it is more difficult to acquire a second language (Brown 1994). Skehan (1998, p. 234) refers to the importance of the learner's memory capacity, which declines after a certain age, starting in adulthood, and a dulthood marks a decrease in incremental learning (Gullberg and Indefrey 2006). Children process language information in a diffe rent region of the brain than adults and this explains why learning a second language for them is easier and faster (Multhaup 1998). When children learn a language, the sa me part of the brain responsible for automatic brain function or \"deep motor area\" is what children use; therefore, language becomes second nature to them (Hadley 2002). The information and skills in the deep motor area of the brain are set during early childhood and this area closes at about 18 years of age. For this reason, adults do not think automatically in another language as children do, even as children are unaware that they are learning a second language (Brown 1994). The following are implications of brain research for second language learning: 1. Build in reflection : It is important to let children take time to \"simmer.\" There is a silent stage to language learning. First children absorb the language. Later they begin to speak (Krashen 1992). 2. Link learning : \"The more you link, the more you learn\" (Dryden and Vos 1999, p. 315). Anything can be linked when learning a second language, including numbers and new vocabulary words (Dryden and Vos 1997). For example, link numbers and words in a playful way (Dryden and Rose 1995). Reciting the numbers from one to ten in the target language in rhythm is a fun way to begin language learning. 3. Use the whole world as the classroom : Real-life experiences and situations engage learners and bring meaning and context to the le arning process (Dryden and Vos 1997). 4. Teaching from the bottom up and the top down : Teaching and learning can be done from the bottom up (simple to complex) and from the top down (complex to simple). Brain research shows that the brain can process comp lex information as well as lower information simultaneously (Sousa 2006). 5. Children learn languages naturally : Children have the ability to learn and excel in the pronunciation of a foreign language (Krashen 1982). Acquiring language is effortless for a young child since it is learned natu rally (Armstrong and Rogers 1997). 6. A second language improves other subject areas : Acquiring a foreign language early in life is not detrimental to basic skills, but rather shows positive results in areas of standardized testing (Armstrong and Rogers 1997). Children who study a second language score higher on verbal standardized tests conducted in Engl ish as well as on math and logic skills than children with just one language (Met 1998). 7. Cognitive development is increased : Children who participate in a foreign language show greater cognitive development in areas such as mental flexibility, creativity, divergent thinking and higher order th inking skills (Hakuta 1990). 8. Self-image improves : Studying a foreign language im proves self-esteem and a sense of achievement in school (Caine and Caine 1994). Spanish Language and Culture 9Y Guide to Implementation (7-9) Chapter 1 / 15 Alberta Education, Alberta, Canada 2010 9. Children become multicultural : Children who study a foreign language acquire a sense of cultural pluralism, ope nness and appreciation of other cultur es (Met 1998). Children maintain family heritage, culture and language by le arning a second language (Hakuta 1990). Sample strategies to support brain-based learning: Develop an understanding of the impact of nutrition, exercise and stress on learning. Facilitate cooperative learning and provide students with opportunities to interact. Use various methods and approaches th at have been proven effective. Acknowledge that students mature at diff erent rates. Because of these natural differences, \"equality\" in student performance is not expected. Provide a learning environment that employs routines and behavioural guidelines, while offering activities that ch allenge and excite students. Model enthusiasm for communicating in the second language. Provide a classroom environment that features changing displays of vocabulary and culturally rich materials. Facilitate language and culture immersion activities, such as field trips, projects, stories, performances and drama. Provide opportunities for students to ac tively process, through reflection and metacognition, what and how they have learned. Account for individual learning preferences. Engage learners in tasks that require both th e right and left hemispheres of the brain, such as using the total physical response method to teach a grammar concept (Caine and Caine 1994). Teach with topics that are interesting to students and enable them to associate language with the specific context at hand. Let the students make connections to the world around them, and introduce topics that are important and interesting (Hadley 2002). Teach vocabulary in a real-life context to improve acquisition (Hakuta 1990). Provide a rich learning environment that will contribute to motivation (Multhaup 1998, p. 88). Encourage students to play with the langua ge in order to feel comfortable and to develop fluency (Asher 2001). Incorporate activities that encourage student s to search for meaning behind terms, concepts and ideas (Sousa 2006). Present information in context so that th e learner can identify patterns and connect with previous experiences (Archibald 2000). Create an atmosphere that is low in threat and high in challenge (Caine and Caine 1994). Language learning is a natural process; it can be done without intervention. By understanding how the brain learns naturally , language teachers can increase their success in the classroom. Although brain research does not specify what to teach, how to organize complex sequences of teaching, or how to work with students with special needs, it complements teachers' own understa nding about learning based on practical and classroom-based research (Genesee 2000). 16 / Chapter 1 Spanish Language and Culture 9Y Guide to Implementation (7-9) 2010 Alberta Education, Alberta, Canada Bloom's Taxonomy Bloom's Taxonomy is a model that focuses on six levels of complexity in the thinking processes. The six levels of the original m odel have recently been revisited and revised to reflect a more accurate explanation and description of actions in the taxonomy. One major change is that the six major categori es are now in verb form. Since the taxonomy reflects different forms of thinking and since th inking is an action, verbs are now used to more accurately reflect the spirit of the ta xonomy. Another difference is the renaming of the former \"Knowledge\" category to \"Remembering.\" Lastly, \"Comprehension\" is now \"Understanding\" and \"Synthesis\" changed to \"C reating\" in order to better reflect the nature of the thinking describ ed by each category. All of the changes help to make the taxonomy a more authentic tool. Understandi ng and Remembering are the lower or more concrete levels of th inking. Creating, Evaluating and Analyzing represent higher or more complex levels of thinking. Applying, whic h falls just below the higher levels, can be less or more complex depending on the task.

There is a growing appreciation of the role that multilingual individuals can play in an increasingly diverse society, and there is a greater understanding of the academic, cultural, economic and cognitive benefits of learning other languages. The last two decades have seen an emerging global inter est in international languages and second language education. This has led research ers, policymakers, educators, employers, parents and the media to re-examine the a dvantages of learning additional languages. Increased research on brain development has focused attention on learning processes and developmental issues. Some of this res earch has analyzed the effects of language acquisition on the brain. The results of these studies have generated interest in how early learning experiences, including first and sec ond language acquisition, promote cognitive development. Most experts agree that ma king it possible for children to learn a second language early in life and beyond is entirely be neficial. A summary of the many benefits of learning a second language follows. Personal Benefits An obvious advantage of knowing more than one language is havi ng expanded access to people and resources. Individuals who speak and read more than one language have the ability to communicate with more people and read more literature and other texts, and benefit more fully from travel to other countri es. Introducing students to alternative ways of expressing themselves and to different cultures gives greater depth to their understanding of the human experience by fost ering an appreciation of the customs and achievements of people beyond their own frames of reference. In many cases, the learning of a second language can strengthen th e personal connection to the language and culture of one's own heritage . Knowledge of a second language can also give people a competitive advantage in the work force by opening up additional job opportunities (Villano 1996). For many people, there's something i nherently enjoyable about successfully communicating in another language. Learni ng a new language can be an intensely challenging and rewarding experience. Cognitive Benefits Some researchers suggest that students who receive second language instruction are more creative and better at solving complex probl ems than those who do not (Bamford and Mizokawa 1991). Other studies suggest that bilingual individuals outperform similar monolinguals on both verbal and nonverbal t ests of intelligence, which raises the question of whether ability in more than one langua ge enables individuals to achieve greater intellectual flexibility (Bruck, Lambert a nd Tucker 1974; Hakuta 1986; Weatherford 1986). Benefits of Second Language Le arning: Adapted from Kathleen M. Marcos , \"Second Language Learning: Everyone Can Benefit,\" The ERIC Review 6, 1 (Fall 1998), pp. 2, 3. 20 / Chapter 1 Spanish Language and Culture 9Y Guide to Implementation (7-9) 2010 Alberta Education, Alberta, Canada Academic Benefits Parents and educators sometimes express c oncern that learning a second language will have a detrimental effect on students' read ing and verbal abilities in English; however, several studies suggest the opposite. Knowi ng a second language, according to the latest research on reading, can help children comp rehend written language faster and possibly learn to read more easily, provided that they are exposed to stories and literacy in both languages (Bialystok 1997). By age four, b ilingual children have progressed more than monolingual children in understanding the sy mbolic function of written language. By age five, bilingual children are more advan ced than those who have learned only one writing system. The positive effects of bilingualism were also documented in an American study analyzing achievement test data of students w ho had participated five years or more in immersion-type international language program s in Fairfax County, Virginia. The study concluded that students scored as well as or better than all comparison groups and continued to be high academic achievers thro ughout their school years (Thomas, Collier and Abbott 1993). Numerous other studies have also shown a positive relationship between foreign language study and achieveme nt in English language arts (Barik and Swain 1975, Genesee 1987, Swain 1981). Societal Benefits Bilingualism and multilingualism have many benefits for society. Albertans who are fluent in more than one language can enhance Alberta's and Canada's economic competitiveness abroad, maintain Alberta's and Canada's political interests and work to promote an understanding of cultural divers ity within the nation. For example, international trade specialists, overseas me dia correspondents, diplomats, airline employees and national security personnel need to be familiar with other languages and cultures to do their jobs well. Teachers, health care providers, customer service representatives and law enforcement personnel also serve their communities more effectively when they can communicate with people of diverse languages and cultures. Developing the language abilities of students will improve the effectiveness of the work force and strengthen communities for years to come. Spanish Language and Culture 9Y Guide to Implementation (7-9) Chapter 2 / 21 Alberta Education, Alberta, Canada 2010 Chapter Summary Introduction Program of Studies Planning Considerations Planning Approaches Year Plans Unit Plans Lesson Plans Introduction Planning models require careful considera tion of the curriculum they are intended to support. Effective planning ensures th at all elements are consistent with the general and specific outcomes of a program of studies. Program of Studies The program of studies prescribes what students are expected to learn and be able to do at each grade level. It is the primary reference for teachers as they plan for student learning. Teachers determine what should be taught to accomplish the general and specific outcomes in the program of studies and continually refer to the program outcomes during the planning process. The General and Specific Outcomes Chart in Appendix A provides a summary of all program outcomes and is useful for planning and tracking outcome coverage throughout the year. Chapter 2 Planning For more information ... Appendix A General and Specific Outcomes Chart 22 / Chapter 2 Spanish Language and Culture 9Y Guide to Implementation (7-9) 2010 Alberta Education, Alberta, Canada Alignment Many school jurisdictions are approaching instructional improvement through planning processes that emphasize the need to align learning outcomes with assessment practices. This alignment helps teachers articulate what students should be able to learn, know and do. A lignment encourages teachers to focus first on the learning outcomes and clearly communicate learning expectations to support and measure student achievement. Alignment can also provide a focus for a teacher's professional development plan that centres on curriculum and instruction. Implementing the Program of Studies The Spanish Language and Culture: 9-year Program Guide to Implementation, Grades 7-8-9 is designed to assist teachers as they plan for and implement the Spanish Language and Culture Nine-year Program, Grades 7-8-9 (the program of studies). The teaching and learning activiti es, assessment strategies, unit plans and lesson plans presented in this guide are suggestions only . They are provided to stimulate ideas and to help teachers envision and plan an effective Spanish classroom program. The Grade Level Samples in Chapter 8 in clude teaching and learning activities and assessment strategies for specific outcomes from Grade 7 to Grade 9. These activities and assessment strategies are samples only, providing teachers with possibilities to consider as they plan and implement the program. Considerations for Effective Implementation Spanish language and culture programs s hould strive to provide a rich language learning environment, stressing communi cative competence and enriched cultural experiences that maximize student opport unities for learning. Opportunities for authentic learning moments (e.g., interviews with or presentations by guests speaking the target language, field trips) or for simulated authentic situations (e.g., shopping trips, the preparation of an authentic dish) should be provided. Effective learning environments are those in which: the individual and collective needs of students are met there is a supportive climate that encourages risk taking and choice diversity in learning preferences and needs is accommodated connections to prior knowledge and experiences are made there is exposure to a wide range of excellent models of authentic language use of the language studied is emphasized quality multimedia, print, human and other resources are available and applied in a supportive, meaningful and purposeful manner. Spanish Language and Culture 9Y Guide to Implementation (7-9) Chapter 2 / 23 Alberta Education, Alberta, Canada 2010 Instructional Time Language and culture programs of st udy are developed based on a recommended 95 hours of instructional time per grade level, or a suggested 150 minutes per week. This is 10 percent of the total instructional time. When planning for instructional time in the Spanish language and culture program, administrators and teachers should carefully consider the impact of time scheduling on the linguistic development of the students. It is strongly recommended that Spanish language and cu lture courses be scheduled to ensure maximum exposure to the language throughout the school year. If students lose contact with the language for long periods of time, additional time must be taken to review previously learned material that ma y have been forgotten. Students benefit from using the language on a daily basis. Class Groupings Many classrooms will contain students at the same grade level with varying proficiency levels. By using a range of instructional and planning strategies, students of different ages and different le vels of ability can be accommodated in a single classroom. Spanish Program Collaboration Effective Spanish language and culture programs depend heavily on collaboration among a range of stakeholders. Students, parents and parental organizations, teachers, school administrators, central administration, government, community members, members of Span ish-speaking communities, pos t-secondary institutions, cultural institutions, and other stakeholde rs all play crucial roles in supporting language and culture programs. Teacher s should ensure that opportunities for collaboration are maximized by establis hing networks of communication with local high schools offering congruent lan guage programs, by being aware of employment opportunities that require a second language or by engaging in activities with languages/classes from other schools. Materials Students should work with all kinds of authentic audio, video, print and multimedia resources, including documents and texts designed for Spanish speakers as well as materials prepared for second language learners. These resources should also be appropriate fo r the age, developmental levels and linguistic levels of the students. Tips for Choosing Appropriate Instructional Materials 1. Materials should be flexible enough to acco mmodate the diversity found in schools and should address a variety of learning preference s, interests, abilities, attention spans and backgrounds. 2. Materials should reinforce positive aspects of the students' self-images. 3. Materials should be relevant to students' interests. For more information ... Chapter 4 Differentiated Instruction 24 / Chapter 2 Spanish Language and Culture 9Y Guide to Implementation (7-9) 2010 Alberta Education, Alberta, Canada Planning for Professional Development Teaching in the Spanish language and cultu re program demands a broad range of knowledge and skills, both in the Span ish language and in second language pedagogy. Teachers should continue to engage in professional development to maintain or improve their proficiency in the Spanish language and to continuously improve their teaching skills. Spanish language and culture teachers w ill benefit from professional development opportunities to speak the language, to increase understanding of Spanish culture and to build their understanding of second language teaching methodologies. In addition, teachers will benefit from pr ofessional development that focuses on: responding to diversity in the classr oom and using multilevel groupings cooperative learning and student-centred learning multimedia and computer-assisted learning resource-based language learning. Student Motivation When students value their learning, believe they can succeed and feel in control of the learning process, they develop motivation and a desire to learn. Teachers can foster students' motivation to learn by: instilling in each student a belief that he or she can learn making students aware that they can learn by using a variety of learning strategies helping students become aware of their own learning processes and teaching them strategies for monitoring these processes assigning tasks and materials of appropriate difficulty and making sure that students receive the necessary instructio n, modelling and guide d practice to be successful communicating assessment processes clearly so that students understand the criteria by which progress and achievement are measured helping students set realistic goals to enhance their learning helping students celebrate their own and their classmates' learning progress and achievements within the school community and the broader community ensuring that instruction is embedded in meaningful learning events and experiences modelling personal enjoyment of Spanish language learning and communicating the value of learning anot her language for success in the world beyond the classroom involving students in the selection of themes, topics, resources and activities around which learning experiences will take place creating inclusive, risk-free classroom co mmunities where curiosity is fostered and active involvement in the learning process is valued and shared providing uninterrupted time for sust ained engagement with appropriate Spanish print and nonprint resources providing collaborative learning experien ces that enable students to exchange ideas and perspectives, develop a sense of purpose and build a sense of community Spanish Language and Culture 9Y Guide to Implementation (7-9) Chapter 2 / 25 Alberta Education, Alberta, Canada 2010 using contextualized vocabulary presentations and visuals, such as pictured vocabulary, videos and charts emphasizing the development of understanding rather than the decontextualized memorization of vocabulary lists and grammar rules scaffolding complex tasks to facilitate the learning of abstract concepts. Planning Considerations Prior Language Experience The Spanish Language and Culture Nine-year Program, Grades 7-8-9 assumes that students have had three years of continuous, articulated instruction in Spanish language and culture. There may be stud ents in the program who have Spanish language experience in settings outside of the classroom; e.g., at home, with extended family, in the community. A few individuals may choose to begin the program in junior high school, knowing that beginning the nine-year program at this time will be a challenge. Some of these late-starting students already have second language competency, perhaps in Spanish or in a language related to Spanish. These students may learn Span ish more quickly and easily than those who began their study of Spanish in Grade 4. To meet students' diverse language b ackgrounds, skills a nd varying language learning needs in the classroom, teachers should first assess students' language levels and then differentiate instruction as necessary. Student and Parent Awareness Students and parents need to be aware of learning outcomes and how they are assessed or evaluated. When students and parents understand learning outcomes and learning outcome assessment or evaluation criteria, they are encouraged to participate in the learning process. Language of Instruction As the ultimate goal of the Spanish La nguage and Culture Nine-year Program, Grade 4 to Grade 12, is to have students use Spanish for a variety of purposes in a variety of situations, Spanish should be modelled and used in class as frequently as possible. English will likely be used to some extent in the beginning stages but can gradually be phased out. It may be decided that certain activities be done in English, such as students' reflective writings and learning logs or the delivery of relatively complex instructions or explanations. 26 / Chapter 2 Spanish Language and Culture 9Y Guide to Implementation (7-9) 2010 Alberta Education, Alberta, Canada Choice of Topics and Tasks The choice of learning topics and tasks should be guided by the needs, interests and daily experiences of the students and by the elements outlined in the four components of the program of studies. Opportunities for Spanish Language Use and Real-life Applications Proficiency-based instruction that focuses on what students can do with what they know is critical. Classroom activities that engage students in meaningful and purposeful language use should predominate. Students will be more successful Spanis h language learners if they have opportunities to use the language for auth entic and meaningful communication in a broad range of contexts. In addition, the curriculum supports and encourages the real-life application of Spanish language learning through meaningful contact with fluent speakers of the Spanish language and authentic texts, such as Spanish- language newspapers, magazines, elec tronic communications and multimedia resources. It is important to have a rich Spanish la nguage environment in the classroom, but it is also very beneficial to provide co curricular and extracurricular activities during which students have opportunities to use and develop their Spanish language skills. Such school-sponsored activities as Spanish language camps, visits to cultural facilities, pen pals, plays and performan ces, language clubs, school visits and exchanges are important. It is also impor tant to encourage students to continue their development of Spanish language sk ills by using the language for personal enjoyment, listening to music, attendi ng cultural events and performances, and accessing and using self-study resources. Knowing the Students Teachers should identify student needs, background knowledge and experience. They should select learning activities that are appropriate for the age and interests of the students and that complement the lexical fields outlined in the program of studies. Instructional plans can be differe ntiated to meet the needs of all students in the class. Planning is continual and is informed by needs that become evident through classroom assessment. Diversity of Needs All classes consist of students with a variety of needs. Some students may have special education needs, while others may be gifted and require greater challenges. Some students may speak English as a second language and require ESL-specific support and accommodations. It is therefore important to always consider the diverse needs of students when pla nning a language and culture program. For more information ... Chapters 4, 5 and 6 For more information ...

Chapters 3, 4, 5 and 6 Spanish Language and Culture 9Y Guide to Implementation (7-9) Chapter 2 / 27 Alberta Education, Alberta, Canada 2010 Plan with an Applications Focus The program of studies specifies four components for the development of communicative competence. The Applications component outcomes provide meaningful contexts for students' la nguage and culture learning. Language Competence, Global Citizenship and Strategies component outcomes can be integrated with Applications outcomes. An initial focus on an Applications outcome(s) can serve to motivate and e ngage students by providing a goal or a reason for their Spanish language and culture learning. When planning, keep a strong focus on Applications in mind and think of ways to integrate learning outcomes from Language Competence, Global Citizenship and/or Strategies with outcomes from Applications. Getting to the Destination Think of the program of studies as a car with four passengers headed to a specific destination. In this scenario, all four occupants contribute to the car reaching its destination\u2014to the achievement of the program learning outcomes. Applications is the driver , making sure the car moves toward the planned destination. If the car is to reach its destination, Applications must be in the driver's seat. Language Competence is the passenger who sits beside Applications, ensuring that the driving is done accurately and competently. Language Competence ensures that the rules of the road are adhered to and interprets various road signs for Applications. Global Citizenship considers what the outside world is like and how it relates to all passengers. Global Citizenship provi des information about the various places the passengers will be driving to and what they can expect when they get there. Strategies is the troubleshooter . Strategies speaks up when questions or problems arise, offering advice about how all passengers can work effectively to make the trip a positive experience. When passengers encounter problems, Strategies shares ideas on how to find soluti ons. Strategies asks the right questions at the right time, making sure everyone in the car knows what they are doing and why they are doing it. All four components are essential to get the car to its destination: Applications to drive the car forward Language Competence to pay attention to accuracy and details Global Citizenship to add colour, life, tolerance and possibilities Strategies to provide important problem-solving skills. To further the metaphor, if the program of studies is a car on a journey, teachers are the navigators. Teachers plan the route and determine when the car has reached its destination. 28 / Chapter 2 Spanish Language and Culture 9Y Guide to Implementation (7-9) 2010 Alberta Education, Alberta, Canada Plan for Strategic Learning Teachers should plan for students to learn and independently select and use cognitive, metacognitive and social/affectiv e strategies. Strategies outcomes for language learning, language use and general learning shoul d be explicitly taught to students. As students become more aware of how to use strategies to enhance their learning, they will be able to choose strate gies that work most effectively for them. Integrate Outcomes Most learning activities, even simple on es, involve multiple specific and general outcomes. For example, singing a Spanish song involves outcomes from the Applications, Language Competence, Global Citizenship and Strategies components of the program of studies. The challenge is for teachers to be familiar with the outcomes and to select outcomes fo r the focus of a lesson (or unit). The teacher plans lessons to ensure that all outcomes receive focused attention periodically throughout the school year. Outcome Integration: A Sample, Grade 8 Activity Divide students into groups and have each group choose a Spanish-speaking community. Students gather information about traditional meals and dishes of that community and organize the information in a KWL chart (see Appendix D: Graphic Organizers). Students then reorganize the information into subtopics and create a cookbook that illustrates the key information and includes several sentences in Spanish that describe the traditional meal s and dishes of that community. Applications A-5.2 gather and organize information a. identify useful and reliable resources Language Competence LC-2.5 written production a. produce short, simple written texts in guided and unguided situations Global Citizenship GC-1.4 diversity within the cultures of the Spanish-speaking world a. organize and represent information on the diverse cultures of the Spanish- speaking world Strategies S-3.1 cognitive a. select and use a variety of cognitive strategies to enhance general learning For more information ... Chapter 3 Spanish Language and Culture 9Y Guide to Implementation (7-9) Chapter 2 / 29 Alberta Education, Alberta, Canada 2010 Identify Instructional Strategies To help students achieve selected outcomes from the program of studies and to best meet the needs of students, teach ers need to use specific instructional strategies. Teachers choose a planning appr oach that suits their needs: thematic, task- or project-based, or a combination. The activities teachers develop or select need to fit with selected teaching and le arning strategies and the specific outcomes targeted. Identify Assessment Tools A variety of assessment tools, ranging from informal observation to formal tests, should be planned for individual teachi ng and learning activities, for report card periods and for teaching units, projects and portfolios. All assessments focus on active involvement of the student in the process, determining if learning outcomes have been achieved, and on how such assessment information can be used to optimize student learning. Planning Approaches Two of the most effective planning approaches for language learning are the thematic approach and the task- or pr oject-based approach. Either of these approaches (or a combination of the two) can be applied to the development of the year, unit or lesson plans for the Spanish language and culture program. Thematic Approach Thematic approaches focus on a specific topic or cen tral idea as the basis for the unit or the lesson plan. The theme c hosen serves as the organizer for the instructional activities. Themes should be Applications-based; e.g., sharing basic information, getting to know people or making yourself understood. Themes need to be big ideas that can provide a framewo rk for exploring and applying new skills and concepts. Thematic planning can be helpful to teachers of multi-age and combined class groupings. When teachers plan for a wide range of abilities, thematic teaching creates a shared experience that all st udents can use to build knowledge, skills and attitudes and to experience success at th eir own level within a collaborative whole-class environment; e.g., vacation and travel in Grade 7, shopping and money in Grade 8, eating out in Grade 9.

Chapter 7 30 / Chapter 2 Spanish Language and Culture 9Y Guide to Implementation (7-9) 2010 Alberta Education, Alberta, Canada Task- or Project-based Approach A task- or project-based approach to learni ng is designed to have students develop language competence and communicative skills by actively engaging in using the language with purpose. The teacher uses task s and projects to create situations in which students must use the language for a definite purpose. The task is defined at the outset and creates the need to know certain elements of the language, thus giving meaning, purpose and context to all language activities. The task provides an organizational frame work for the specific outcomes to be achieved. All content, activities and evaluation in the unit grow out of the task. Specific language content is determined once the task has been identified. Explicit teaching of grammar rules, exercises on form and practice of specific strategies have their place in the classroom, but they are done because students need to know those elements of the Spanish language to accomplish the task. The choice of tasks can be based on the interests of students while covering as broad a range of experiences as possible. Each task should be flexible enough to allow for some differentiation so students with different levels of proficiency, interests and backgrounds can work toge ther and learn from one another. For example, students could develop an itinerary for a week-long trip to a Spanish-speaking city or country, plan a budget for one week's worth of shopping expenses, or order a three-course meal in a restaurant. Effective tasks and projects: provide opportunities to address a variety of specific outcomes match the interests of the students focus students on meaning and purpose maximize language use and provide opportunities for language practice allow for flexible approaches and solutions are challenging, but not threatening promote sharing of information and expertise involve students in assessing/evaluating the product and the process provide opportunities for students to discuss and reflect upon communication (metacommunication) and learning (metacognition) provide for monitoring and feedback. By examining tasks in relation to the factors shown in the following table, appropriate tasks for each student can be chosen. Sometimes a task may appear too difficult, but it could be done, if it is of great interest to students, by adjusting some of the variables. In the same way, a task can be made more or less difficult to suit different groups of stude nts in a mixed-level class group.

It can be focused on one subject or integrate multiple subjects. A year plan supports instructional goals and outcomes across an entire program of studies and provides opportunities to plan for implementation in a school or district setting as well as in an individual classroom. A year plan can consist of multiple units , organized coherently across the school year. Year plans should address all outcomes of a program of studies in a meaningful and appropriate sequence that is determined by essential learnings and the learning needs of students. A year pl an does not necessarily have to follow the sequence of the outcomes in a program of studies. A year plan can be constructed and represented in a teacher resource by using a curriculum mapping process that includes: a sequence of outcomes and essential learnings that indicates when content will be taught how outcomes will be grouped or clustered to create units expectations of student learning instructional activities that support student learning. There are a number of formats for developing a year plan. Generally, a year plan should be one or two pages that clearly and concisely outline topics and skills on a time line. A year plan should also a ddress integrated units of instruction and combined grade teaching. Unit Plans Unit plans provide a sequence of instruc tion that usually takes place over a number of weeks. Unit plans provide a clear and coherent structure that addresses outcomes, assessment and instructiona l activities and allows for choice and different learning needs. Unit plans are more detailed outlines of the broad pieces of learning that make up a year plan. Teachers need to know their students and use professional judgement and creativity to develop a unit plan that is focused, meaningful and relevant. In a unit plan, teachers specify what needs to be in place for the unit to be a successful learning experience; e.g., teachers consider resources, allocate time, prepare information, identify vocabulary, identify instructional strategies, decide on provisions for students with special edu cation needs and include home, school and community connections. Teachers start with the end in mind, and build in a range of assessment activities throughout the unit. When possible, teachers collaborate with colleagues to develop and share units . Teachers also plan ways to extend learning for students who demonstrate highe r level skills and to support those who need additional guided practice or reinforcement. To assess the instructional e ffectiveness of a unit of study, Politano and Paquin (2000) suggest that teachers ask themselves: \"What am I doing that is working well? What do I want to reconsider or stop doing? What do I want to do more of?\" (p. 128). For a blank template ... Appendix C Year Plan For blank templates ... Appendix C Unit Plan Overview, Unit Plan A, Unit Plan B, Unit Plan C Spanish Language and Culture 9Y Guide to Implementation (7-9) Chapter 2 / 33 Alberta Education, Alberta, Canada 2010 Developing a Unit Plan There are three basic decisions involved in unit planning that should be made by considering the curriculum and the classroom. WHAT I WILL USE PLANNING TASKS What are students expected to learn ? Program of studies outcomes Identify the desired results What evidence will I accept of that learning ? Achievement goals, indicators, exemplars Determine acceptable evidence How will I design instruction for effective learning by all students ? Teaching and learning strategies, resources Plan learning experiences and instruction A planning technique that is especially useful in unit planning is clustering. Clustering is a process that can be used to group outcomes around the essential learnings of a program of studies. Clusters use common concepts, ideas and processes to group similar or related outcom es together. Clusters can be used to create groups of outcomes that students should attain at the completion of a learning sequence in a unit. They can be a first step in establishing a learning sequence for the unit. Clusters can also help identify the essentia l learnings and essential questions. Each cluster can represent an enduring or overarching understanding\u2014or a cluster of essential learning statements and ques tions. Enduring and overarching understandings go beyond facts and skills to fo cus on larger concepts, principles or processes. An effective unit plan is a meaningful se quence of learning opportunities that starts with learning outcomes, clustered together in contexts that are aligned with essential learnings, assessment approaches, resources and teaching and learning strategies. This alignment is critical to a purposeful planning process. Questions can also provide a meaningful context that encourages the development of critical thinking and inquiry-based sk ills. Questions can provide a focus for assessment when built around essential learnings and criteria for the students' demonstration of learning. General ques tions can provide an overarching focus for the entire unit, while specific questions can help students uncover the essential learning and guide the sequence of the unit. The differences between general unit questions and specific unit questions General unit questions provide a context for meaningful learning and the development of deep understandings. General unit questions are ongo ing and, in one form or another, often recur throughout life. Developing a Unit Plan: Adapted with permissi on from Patricia Shields-Ramsay and Doug Ramsay, Purposeful Planning Guidebook (Edmonton, AB: InPraxis Learning Systems, 2006), pp. 4, 5, 12-13, 16. 34 / Chapter 2 Spanish Language and Culture 9Y Guide to Implementation (7-9) 2010 Alberta Education, Alberta, Canada Specific unit questions, on the other hand, can he lp students explore general unit questions. They can focus on building vocabulary, develo ping understanding of the terms and concepts within a general question, and guiding research. Specific unit questions can: be written to \"uncover\" the general questions of the unit guide the inquiry of the unit be sequenced to provide the \"flow\" of the unit. For example, specific unit questions such as the following could support the general unit question, \"How do patterns, inconsistencies an d misunderstandings inform our understandings ?\": How is our information collected and represented ? How do patterns and connections in information help solve problems ? How can misunderstandings be uncovered ? When developing a unit plan, teachers shoul d consider the specific needs of their students and select strategies and specific learning activities designed to achieve several learning outcomes. Unit planning using a thematic approach or a task- or project-based approach to second language learning begins with a theme, topic, task or project. The language content grows out of the theme, topic, task or project and the resources used. Tips for Developing a Unit Plan 1. Choose a theme, topic, task or project that is of interest to the students, offers possibilities for developing the students' communicative comp etence in Spanish and allows for some general learning as well. Students can partic ipate in this step of the planning process. 2. Determine the specific outcomes that could be met, keeping in mind all general outcomes. 3. Analyze the task or project to determine what the students will need to know and learn to carry it out. Think about the product the students will produc e, but also about the process they will go through in producing the produc t; e.g., working in groups, doing research, interviewing people. Consider language fu nctions, vocabulary, grammar, text types, historical and contemporary elements of the culture, strategies, general knowledge and so on. 4. Think about aspects of the unit that coul d be adapted to accommodate the needs, interests and aptitudes of different students. Be prepared to be as flexible as possible without compromising the objectives of the unit. 5. Look for resources that will be useful to students . Resources should be attractive and rich in visual supports, such as charts, pictures and diagrams. 6. Outline a series of steps directly related to the unit task or project to help the students learn and practise the language they w ill need to carry out that task. 7. Plan student assessment and evaluation. Integrate assessment throughout the unit. 8. At the end of the unit, invite students to reflect on what they learned, the strategies they used and how their attitudes may have changed. This step is important for developing metacognitive strategies and independent learning. For more information ...

Lessons often include the whole class and provide a basis from which other lessons can evolve. Follow-up lessons could incl ude individual sessions with students who have specific needs, small groups focusi ng on specific skill development or large discussion groups. Lesson plans should address: information about students' prior experience, understandings and needs clustered curriculum outcomes assessment criteria instructional activities resources time and materials. Consider the following questions when planning a lesson: What is the purpose or curricular outcome of the lesson? What teaching and learning strategies will be most effective? What will students be doing? When? Where? What specific skills do students need to develop or improve to be successful? What resources will be most appropriate for various groups in the class?

Video recording and viewing equipment (optional). Teaching and Learning Activities: With students, brainstorm various social activities of interest to them; e.g., sports, going out, club meetings, shopping. Students circulate and ask one another in Spanish what their favourite social activities are. Encourage students to remember nonverbal communica tion associated with social activities. After a few minutes, ask students to offer their favour ite activity and a classmate's favourite activity. Hola. Me gusta bailar, y a Jus tin, le gusta pasear en bicicleta. Once students have had sufficient time for their interac tions, consider allowing diffe rent student groups to present their conversations to the class.

Spanish Language and Culture 9Y Guide to Implementation (7-9) Chapter 3 / 41 Alberta Education, Alberta, Canada 2010 Chapter Summary Learning Strategies Instructional Strategies Using Technology in the Classroom Learning Strategies Strategies are systematic and conscious pl ans, actions and thoughts that learners select and adapt to each task. Strategies he lp learners know what to do, how to do it, when to do it and why doing it is useful. Students use various strategies to maximize the effectiveness of their learning and communication. Strategic competence has long been recognized as an important component of communicative competence. To become successful strategic learners, students need : step-by-step strategy instruction a wide array of instructional approaches and learning materials modelling, guided practice and independent practice opportunities to transfer skills and ideas from one situation to another practice in making meaningful conn ections between skills and ideas and real-life situations opportunities to be independent and to show what they know tools and encouragement to self-monitor, self-correct, and reflect on and assess their own learning. Chapter 3 Learning and Instructional Strategies 42 / Chapter 3 Spanish Language and Culture 9Y Guide to Implementation (7-9) 2010 Alberta Education, Alberta, Canada Students need to develop proficiency usi ng a strategy before new strategies are introduced. Over time, students will develop a number of strategies to facilitate their learning. Some learning strategies are appropriate for early, middle and senior years, while other strategies may be appropriate only for a specific level. Students need to: know how they will benefit from the use of a strategy in order to become motivated and engaged in learning and to develop the will to apply the strategy know what steps are involved in the strategy's procedure know when the strategy should be used so that they can ensure transfer to other scenarios know how to adjust the strategy to fit their particular purposes practise the strategy over time to develop proficiency. The strategies that students choose depend on the task they are engaged in as well as on other factors such as their preferred learning style, personality, age, attitude and cultural background. Strategies that work well for one person may not be effective for another person, or may not be suitable in a different situation. Possible student learning strategies are li sted for many of the activities in the instructional strategies section of this chap ter to illustrate the types of strategies students might use. These lists are not meant to be prescriptive. For a more extensive list of learning strategies, consu lt the Strategies section of the program of studies. To ensure that students develop effective, independent, lifelong learning skills, it is essential to foster strategic learning in the Spanish language and culture classroom. To develop advanced langua ge skills, including literacy, students need instruction on the strategies that skillful learners use in completing language tasks. Students need to be taught learning strategies in all language arts through demonstration, explicit instruction, guided practice and independent practice with feedback and support. Students are encouraged to acqui re and apply a wide range of strategies, including first and second language lear ning strategies and general learning strategies, to enhance their learning. The program of studies includes clusters of specific outcomes designed to develop three types of strategies in the Spanish language and culture classroom: language learning strategies, language use strate gies and general learning strategies. Language Learning Strategies Language learning strategies refer to actions taken by learners to enhance their own language learning. These strategies are divided into three categories: cognitive , metacognitive and social/affective . For more information ... Spanish Language and Culture Nine-year Program, Grades 7-8-9 For more information ... Appendix C Sample List of Learning Strategies Spanish Language and Culture 9Y Guide to Implementation (7-9) Chapter 3 / 43 Alberta Education, Alberta, Canada 2010 Cognitive language learning strategies include using different techniques for remembering new words and phrases, deducing grammar rules, applying previously learned rules, guessing at th e meaning of unknown words, and using a variety of ways to organize new info rmation and link the new information to previously learned language. Metacognitive language learning strategies are higher order thinking skills that students use to manage their own language learning. These strategies include planning for language learning, mon itoring language learning and evaluating success in language learning. Social/affective language learning strategies are actions learners take during or related to interactions with others to assist or enhance their own language learning. These strategies include methods students use to regulate their emotions, motivation and attitudes to help them learn the language. Language Use Strategies Language use strategies are actions ta ken to enhance communication. These strategies are often used with no intention of trying to acquire language, but instead with the intention of improving communication. The language use strategies in the program of studies are organized according to the three communicative modes: interactive , interpretive and productive . Interactive language use strategies assist the learner or speaker in maintaining communication with another speaker of the language. These strategies include using circumlocution to compensate for one's lack of vocabulary, using nonverbal cues to communicate and summarizing the point reached in a discussion. Interpretive language use strategies aid in comprehension of the language. These strategies include using visual suppor ts to assist in comprehension, listening or looking for key words or elements, and using discourse markers to follow extended texts. Productive language use strategies aid in the production of language. These strategies include using resources to increase vocabulary or improve texts, compensating for avoiding difficult structures by rephrasing and using knowledge of sentence patterns to create new sentences. General Learning Strategies General learning strategies refer to actions taken by learners to enhance their own general learning. As with language lear ning strategies, general learning strategies are divided into three categories: cognitive , metacognitive and social/affective . There is a distinct similarity between language learning strategies and general learning strategies; however, the determin ing difference is whether the purpose of the specific strategy is the learning of th e language or of other concepts. Often, other concepts include subject-area concep ts, such as social studies or health concepts, learned through the Spanish language. 44 / Chapter 3 Spanish Language and Culture 9Y Guide to Implementation (7-9) 2010 Alberta Education, Alberta, Canada Cognitive general learning strategies are direct strategies that students use to assist themselves in learning. These strategies include concept mapping, memorizing facts and brainstorming. Metacognitive general learning strategies are higher order skills that students use to manage their own learning. These strategies include planning for their own learning (e.g., choosing a way to memorize social studies facts in Spanish) and assessing their own learning. Social/affective general learning strategies are actions learners take during or related to interactions with others to assi st or enhance their own general learning. These strategies include methods students use to regulate their emotions, motivations and attitudes to help them learn concepts. Teaching Learning Strategies Strategies should be introduced as they ar e needed. When strategies are introduced and explained in terms of their value to students and are demonstrated and practised by students over time, they can produce long-lasting, significant improvements in the students' abilities to construct meaning, acquire language and achieve the Spanish language and culture outcomes. All students benefit from strategy instruction, but individual st udents need varying degrees of support in learning and using strategies. Tips for Teaching a New Learning Strategy 1. Explain the strategy, discussing its purpose and the tasks for which it is most useful. 2. Model the strategy, \"thinking aloud\" so that students can observe the process. This means expressing both the overt purpose of the strategy and the metacognitive processes and self-correction used in any problem-solving method. Avoid mental leaps. 3. Teach the steps of the strategy, explaining the reasons for each step so that student learning will be based on unde rstanding rather than on rote memorization. 4. Provide an immediate opportunity for students to use the strategy in the context of their own work. As students use the strategy, offer co nstructive feedback, monitor and prompt when necessary. 5. Review the strategy by modelling it again, this time with students monitoring and prompting. 6. In subsequent lessons, ask students to practise using the strategy, explaining what the strategy is designed to do, the steps that must be followed and the importance of each step. 7. Follow up with other opportunities for students to use the strategy and to reflect on their use of it as they move toward mastery. Moni tor each student to de termine what personal meaning he or she has made related to the strategy. 8. Discuss with students how the strategy can be used beyond the language and culture classroom. Spanish Language and Culture 9Y Guide to Implementation (7-9) Chapter 3 / 45 Alberta Education, Alberta, Canada 2010 Instructional Strategies Instructional strategies are the techni ques and activities teachers use to help students become independent learners an d develop and experiment with learning strategies. Students exhibit a wide variety of pe rceptions, prior knowledge, attitudes and learning preferences. Teachers are encourag ed to use a variety of instructional strategies to ensure that all student needs are being met. The following instructional strategies can be used across grade levels. Auditory Discrimination Activities Auditory discrimination activities require students to consider and identify sounds in words. These activities can be used to introduce oral language. Possible Student Learning Strategies: Cognitive Use mental images to remember new information Look for patterns and relationships Interpretive Listen selectively based on purpose Determine the purpose of listening Find the Right Sound Create or purchase flash cards that incl ude pictures of objects with the names written below. Instruct the students to listen for a particular sound as you read each word. Have students collect only tho se cards with the words that contain the right sound; e.g., all the cards with words containing \"rr.\" The students then hand in the cards, repeating the words as they do so. If the students make a mistake, simply take the card, point to the word and repeat it, say the letter sound on its own and move on. Sort the Sounds Create or purchase flash cards that incl ude pictures of objects with the names written below. Instruct the students to listen to the words as you read them and decide which \"sound category\" (e.g., \"rr\" or \"r\") they belong to. The students should take each card and put it in the correct pile, repeating the word as they do so. If the students make a mistake, simp ly take the card, point to the word and repeat it, say the letter sound on its own, then place the card in the correct pile. 46 / Chapter 3 Spanish Language and Culture 9Y Guide to Implementation (7-9) 2010 Alberta Education, Alberta, Canada Categorizing Categorizing involves grouping objects or ideas that have common features or relationships. It enables students to see patterns and connections and develops their abilities to manage and organize inform ation. Categorizing is often used to organize information produced during a brainstorming activity. Possible Student Learning Strategies: Cognitive Group together sets of things\u2014vocabulary, structures\u2014with similar characteristics Look for patterns and relationships Cloze Activities In cloze activities, words, phrases or letters are omitted from printed text. Students employ language cueing systems to insert word s or letters that complete the text in a meaningful way. Cloze activities prom ote sense-making skills and reflection on the rules of language (e.g ., \"I know the word and to fill in the missing sound I need to add the letter 'a.'\" \"This sentence doesn't make sense unless I put the word 'and' in it.\"). Avoid having too many bl anks initially, and begin by blanking-out the same type of letter or word cons istently (e.g., the long vowel sounds, the adjectives). Possible Student Learning Strategies: Social/Affective Seek the assistance of a friend to interpret a text Interpretive Listen or look for key words Infer probable meanings of unknown words or expressions from contextual clues Letter-level Cloze Select high frequency words from students' oral vocabulary, from classroom word walls or from reading, and reproduce them with key letters missing. Begin by following a consistent pattern; e.g., remove th e first letter, remove the last letter. Students should know what word they are tr ying to make either because it has been vocalized or because it is within a familia r context; e.g., a sentence from a story. As students become more adept, focus on words that are easily confused. This works really well as part of a myster y message written on the board each morning as a \"do now\" activity. Word-level Cloze Select sentences from students' reading or language-experience stories (short pieces of writing dictated by the student) and reproduce them with key words missing. Begin by following a consistent pattern; e.g., remove adjectives. Students should be able to use the context of the sentence to figure out a word that makes sense. Early on, it is advisable to provide students with a bank of possible words to choose from. Spanish Language and Culture 9Y Guide to Implementation (7-9) Chapter 3 / 47 Alberta Education, Alberta, Canada 2010 Tips for Cloze Activities 1. Introduce students to cloze proc edures with oral activities. Read a passage aloud, pausing occasionally to encourage students to comp lete lines or phrases with appropriate and meaningful words. 2. Choose or write a text appropriate to the students' level of understanding. Leave the first sentence untouched. De lete a number of words from the rest of the text, leaving the last sentence untouched as well. There are a number of ways to decide possible words to delete; e.g., key words related to the topic of the sentence or words that have a particular grammatical function, such as a ll the adjectives or pronouns. 3. Replace the words with blanks of equal length so there is no clue as to the length of the deleted words. 4. Advise students to use any clues they can find in the text or any knowledge they have of the topic or language to try to discov er what the missing words are. 5. Ask students to explain why they think a particular word fits the blank in the sentence. If there is more than one suggestion, students ca n discuss reasons for each choice and decide which suggestion is best. The sharing of ideas an d of interpretation strategies is an important aspect of this instructional method. Cooperative Learning Activities Cooperative learning involves students worki ng in small groups to complete tasks or projects. Tasks are structured so that each group member contributes. Success is based on the performance of the gro up rather than on the performance of individual students. Cooperative learning stresses interdepende nce and promotes cooperation rather than competition. Establishing and main taining cooperative group norms develops the concept of a community of learners. Cooperative learning activities play an important role in increasing students' respect for, and understanding of, one anot her's abilities, interests and needs. These activities promote risk taking and team building and develop group responsibility and social skills. Cooperativ e group work provides opportunities for students to take an active role in the language acquisition pr ocess, while allowing the teacher to be a \"guide on the side.\" Possible Student Learning Strategies: Social/Affective Initiate and maintain interaction with others Work cooperatively with peers in small groups Work with others to solve problems and get feedback Interactive Interpret and use a variety of nonverbal cues to communicate Repeat part of what someone has said to confirm mutual understanding For more information ... Chapter 4 Using Collaborative Learning 48 / Chapter 3 Spanish Language and Culture 9Y Guide to Implementation (7-9) 2010 Alberta Education, Alberta, Canada Tips for Cooperative Learning Activities 1. Create small, diverse groups to allow studen ts to learn from one another's strengths and abilities. 2. Structure groups so success depends on each group member being responsible for some part of the task. Assign roles within each grou p. Rotate roles so that all students have the opportunity to experience each role. 3. Discuss and model collaborative skills, such as li stening, allowing others to speak, asking for help, reaching consensus and completing a task within the allotted time. Provide opportunities for students to practise these skills and to receive feedback and reinforcement. 4. Allow students time to evaluate the cooperative learning process, both individually and as a group. Brainstorm Carousel Brainstorming allows students to share their ideas in a collective manner. Ideas flow and build on one another as the group generates information on a specific topic. The brainstorming process deve lops student vocabulary and creates an environment that encourages respect for ot hers, as judgement is suspended on all the ideas presented. In the \"carousel\" approach to brainstorming, students are divided into groups of four to six, depending upon the number of subtopics. Each group is provided with one sheet of chart paper and a particular coloured marker so group contributions can be tracked by colour. Each group writes down as many ideas as possible on their designated subtopic within a set period of time. Students then pass their chart paper to the next group. The groups revi ew the ideas of the previous group and add their own. The chart paper circulates through all groups until it returns to its original group. Corners In a corners activity, students express opinions and listen to the different points of view of their classmates. This helps to promote understanding of, and respect for, others. To begin, announce what each corner of th e room will represent. Actual objects or pictures can be placed in each corner to facilitate recognition. Ask a question and have students think about the question a nd decide which corner best represents their thinking or their answer to the question. Students then go to the designated corner and discuss their answers with the other students who chose that corner. A spokesperson from each corner is cho sen to summarize and present the ideas discussed. Spanish Language and Culture 9Y Guide to Implementation (7-9) Chapter 3 / 49 Alberta Education, Alberta, Canada 2010 Example When discussing friends and activities, place a symbol representing a different season in each corner of the room\u2014a snow flake, an autumn leaf, a spring flower, a bright sun. Ask a question such as: Which is your favourite season and why ? Students move to the season corner that represents their favourite season. The students in each corner discuss their ideas, then listen to and paraphrase ideas from all the other corners. Eight Square This instructional strategy is usef ul for accessing and reviewing background knowledge and is particularly beneficial fo r students experiencing difficulty, as they are exposed to the information over and over again. Eight square activities function like a scavenger hunt. Students are given a piece of paper divided into eight squares, each of which identifies a specific piece of information to look for. The eight squa res can reflect questions about language, food, arts or any other element of the culture being studied. Students must then circulate around the room, seeking out classmates who can provide the information requested and sign the appropria te square. Finally, the t eacher calls on a student to share the name and information from one squa re of his or her paper with the class. The person whose name appears in the squa re will be the next to share with the class. Individual students can be called on only once. Example: Find someone who can: name 3 social activities in Spanish name three body parts in Spanish name four different types of stores in Spanish sing you a simple song in Spanish identify a difference between his or her first language and Spanish name two modes of transportation in Spanish name three items of clothing in Spanish name a strategy for remembering new vocabulary 50 / Chapter 3 Spanish Language and Culture 9Y Guide to Implementation (7-9) 2010 Alberta Education, Alberta, Canada Focus Trio Focus trio is used with oral comprehension (audio or video segments, guest speakers) or with written comprehension activ ities. It allows students to anticipate or predict the content of a presentation or text based on their previous knowledge. This strategy helps to build confidence and risk-taking behaviour. Students are divided into groups of three. Trios are asked to write down what they already know about the topic or questions that they think will be answered. When they hear or read the text, students verify their predictions and write down any new information they find interesting. Afte r the presentation, they discuss predictions and new information. A class discussion may follow. Informal Groups Pairs or small groups are quickly formed to do a specific task in a short period of time. Students could brainstorm lists of words or ideas; express personal opinions on a film, a song or a current event; or give a brief report on learning strategies they have recently tried. They could sh are Spanish culture-related Internet sites they found useful and interesting. Inside-outside Circle In this activity, students form two concen tric circles with the two groups facing each other. Each student works with the person facing him or her to discuss, describe or practise. Students then rotate to the right or left around their circle and repeat the activity until everyone has shared several times with different partners. The same procedure can be used for st udents to develop and pose their own questions. This instructional strategy is an effective way to encourage every student to participate while teaching skills and concepts that may require varying degrees of repetition for mastery, such as vocabulary acquisition and grammar. Example Each student is given a picture card with an illustration of an item from a lexical field, such as family, body parts, animals or holidays. On a cue from the teacher, students rotate several places to the left or right and present their picture cards to their partners. Each student attempts to name the item depicted on the other's card. If a student is unable to answer, his or her partner provides the answer. To allow for varying developmental levels, include the text on the back of the card and provide each student with developmentally appropriate vocabulary to ensure that all students have learned at least one new vocabulary item. Jigsaw Jigsaw is a strategy for organizing cooperative learning groups to share the workload on larger projects. Divide students into groups of four. These groups will be the students' home groups. Explain the project, outline student responsibilities, explain the skills that are to be developed and clearly explain how students will be assessed. Within the home groups, each student agrees to a partic ular role and becomes the \"expert\" on that role for the group. Spanish Language and Culture 9Y Guide to Implementation (7-9) Chapter 3 / 51 Alberta Education, Alberta, Canada 2010 The experts on the same role from each home group then come together to form expert groups. In their expert groups, they work on their particular aspect of the project and decide how to present or teach this to the other members of their home groups. Once students finish in their expert groups, they return to their home groups. They use what they have learned and teach it to the other group members, remaining the expert on that role for their groups. Jigsaw activities can help students explore program outcomes that relate to historical and contemporary elements of the culture and outcomes that focus on using strategies to maximize the effectiveness of learning. Tip for Jigsaw Activities As groups work, observe student progress, record your observations for feedback and intervene to assist if needed. Encourage the group members to solve any problems collaboratively. Numbered Heads This strategy is effective for review ing material, checking for knowledge and comprehension, and tutoring. It develops team-building skills and provides a safe risk-taking environment, since the group is challenged to arrive at a consensus. This activity can be less threatening for students who are shy or have weaker oral skills. Students are organized into groups of four, and the group members number off from one to four. Students are asked a question and are given time to collaboratively come up with an answer. Call out a number from one to four. The person assigned that number in each group ra ises his or her hand or stands up. Randomly select one of these students to answer. If the answer is incorrect, call on another of the selected students to give an answer. Round Robin Students are divided into groups of four. When the signal to begin is given, each student, in turn, contributes an idea orally\u2014a word, phrase or sentence. Example Students are grouped into fours and asked to name an activity they enjoy doing with their friends. Students take turns until each one has named three activities. Each student could then be asked to identify his or her favourite activity of the three. 52 / Chapter 3 Spanish Language and Culture 9Y Guide to Implementation (7-9) 2010 Alberta Education, Alberta, Canada Talking Chips Talking chips is a cooperative learning strate gy that can be used effectively during group discussion with junior high school students. Each student is given one marker. When a student wishes to speak, he or she puts his or her marker in the centre of the group's circle. A student cannot speak again until everyone in the group has placed his or her marker in the centre. When each student has had the chance to speak, the markers are retrieve d and anyone can speak again by repeating the process. This strategy ensures that everyone has an equal opportunity to speak. Think-Pair-Share In a think-pair-share activity, students th ink individually, turn to a partner and discuss in pairs (or trios) and then share responses with the large group. This type of sharing allows for flexibility and can easily be used throughout learning activities. Think-pair-share activities usually ask students to summarize, question or clarify ideas. All students are accountable for listening actively and contributing to the group and/or the class, making this strategy valuable for students who rarely participate or for those who find active lis tening difficult. Also, as they share in pairs or in trios, students are exposed to peer models of language response and social behaviour. Three-step Interview This strategy maximizes student particip ation and is useful for predicting, hypothesizing, providing personal reacti ons, reinforcing content and summarizing learning. Divide students into groups of four and then into pairs. Partner A interviews Partner B. Then the students reverse roles. Each student, in turn, shares with the group what he or she has learned in the interview. Three-to-one Technique In the three-to-one technique, the teacher poses questions that allow at least three possible answers. In trios, each student gives one possible answer and a recorder for the group writes down the responses. Students with learning difficulties might respond with only one word but are still able to contribute to the group. The teacher then asks a follow-up question that challenges the students to agree on one best answer by discussing and possibly combining ideas. Each member must agree on the selected answer and be able to just ify the answer to the class (Bellanca and Fogarty 1990). Spanish Language and Culture 9Y Guide to Implementation (7-9) Chapter 3 / 53 Alberta Education, Alberta, Canada 2010 Demonstration Demonstration allows for discussion and m odelling of particular skills or processes that help students acquire procedural kno wledge; e.g., taking students step by step through the writing process or a particular learning strategy. Possible Student Learning Strategies: Interpretive Determine the purpose of listening Listen or look for key words Infer probable meanings of unknown words or expressions from contextual clues Example Demonstrate how to make a traditional cup of hot chocolate, how to play castanets, how to introduce a friend to the class and so on. Didactic Questions Didactic questions ask for facts that focus on one topic. Effective didactic questions check for learning, tap into previous learning and encourage creative thinking. They often begin with who, what , where , when or how. Possible Student Learning Strategies: Interpretive Make connections between texts on the one hand and prior knowledge and personal experience on the other Summarize information gathered Forming Learning Groups Depending upon the nature of the task or th e activity, the class can be divided into pairs, trios, quads and so on. The pairs or groups can be formed at random or can be predetermined. Once in pairs or gr oups, various group roles can be assigned, again at random or predetermined before the activity or task begins. Chalkboard List This is a good strategy to use when students are finishing their work at different times. As students complete one assignment, they write their names on the chalkboard. When three names accumula te, these students form a new group and move on to the next activity . 1. Lee 1. Eric 1. 1. 2. Sam 2. Haijia 2. 2. 3. Lais 3. 3. 3. 54 / Chapter 3 Spanish Language and Culture 9Y Guide to Implementation (7-9) 2010 Alberta Education, Alberta, Canada Pairing Up Partners Partners can find each other by followin g a matching process. Use sets of cards with categories such as: opposites synonyms word associations first and last names one half of a shape or a picture. Random Groups Students number off or they draw names, shapes, puzzle pieces or toothpicks out of a bag or hat. The matching process can al so be used with categories such as: one's birthday month cities provinces seasons weather expressions various forms of a conjugated verb clothing playing cards parts of the body foods stores and what one buys there. Gallery Walk Gallery walk (Brownlie and Close 1992) is a process by which students use observation skills to gather data and draw conclusions about a topic. Gallery walk is frequently used with other learning stra tegies to allow students to view others' work, including representations, and process th e content in preparation for further discussion or consensus building. Tips for Gallery Walk Activities 1. The teacher or students construct displays repres enting various aspects of a topic. Displays may also be the result of individual student or small-group inquiries on a topic. One person serves as the curator and remains to explain the display. 2. Students are paired and directed to visit displays located around the room. Students are to observe the displays carefully, talking with th eir partners and recording their observations and the important points of their discussion. They then move on to the next display and repeat the procedure. 3. Students review their observation notes and then make individual lists of what they think are the most important observations. 4. Each student shares his or her individual list with someone other than the original partner and negotiates with a new partner to create a common list. 5. Each pair of students finds another pair of students and negotiates a common list for that group. 6. Follow-up might include written summaries, wh ole-class consensus or short oral feedback sessions. Spanish Language and Culture 9Y Guide to Implementation (7-9) Chapter 3 / 55 Alberta Education, Alberta, Canada 2010 Games Once students have developed a level of comfort with the new language and environment, games can be an effective means of learning new vocabulary, reinforcing concepts and assessing literacy skills. It is important to develop a variety of games that involve the w hole class, small groups, partners and individuals (games that are suitable for both teacher direction and independent use). Games are often: interactive cooperative competitive fun clearly defined by rules over at a predetermined point. Some examples of games frequently played in second language classrooms are Simon Says, Around the World, Hangman, Go Fish and Twenty Questions. Possible Student Learning Strategies: Social/Affective Understand that making mistakes is a natural part of language learning Be willing to take risks and to try unfamiliar tasks and approaches Work cooperatively with peers in small groups Tips for Games Activities 1. Target a particular language concept, such as a lexical field, a grammatical structure or a specific application, as the academic focus of the game. 2. Focus as much as possible on student-to-student interaction. 3. Allow for errors and lots of practice. 4. Use games to support what is being taught in class. Gouin Series (Echo-acting) For this strategy, prepare a series of six to ten short statements describing a logical sequence of actions that takes place in a specific context; e.g., getting up in the morning, cooking a meal, using the library, making a telephone call. These statements should all include action verbs and use the same tense and the same person throughout. Present the statements to the class orally, accompanying them with pantomime of the actions involved. The class responds first through mimicking the actions involved and later by imitating the statements while doing the actions. For example: I get the lettuce, tomatoes, cucumbers and peppers out of the refrigerator. I wash all the vegetables. I shred the lettuce with my hands. I cut the tomatoes into small pieces. I peel the cucumber. I cut the cucumber into slices. I cut the peppers into strips. For more information ... Danesi, Marcel. A Guide to Puzzles and Games in Second Language Pedagogy . Toronto, ON: OISE Press, 1985. 56 / Chapter 3 Spanish Language and Culture 9Y Guide to Implementation (7-9) 2010 Alberta Education, Alberta, Canada I toss the vegetables. I add dressing on my salad. I eat my salad. In preparing a Gouin series, it is useful to have simple props and visuals for at least some of the activities. Graphic Organizer Activities Graphic organizers can help students unde rstand a concept and reduce the load on their short-term memories. Displaying a concept visually enables students to focus their attention on language development. Graphic organizers link the language and content, often forming a bridge to knowle dge that the student may already have in his or her first language. Using a graphic organizer to teach new c oncepts is an effective way to engage students in discussion and have them learn essential vocabulary in a meaningful context. Initial teaching about the use of graphic organizers should always include teacher modelling and discussion about the role of graphic organizers in helping students organize their thinking and in providing a b ase of information. For example, when showing students the process for using a genre map to analyze a mystery, read a mystery to the class and help students identify on a large genre map at the front of the class the mystery, the events, the main suspects and the reasons for the suspicion. Discuss the key elements of a mystery and how relationships in a mystery might be represented. Students could then read a short mystery and complete their own maps. Further scaffolding might be accomplished by giving students a partially completed map or by providing support in picking out and placing information on the map. After classroom practice with a variety of graphic organizers, students should be able to choose appropriate organizers relate d to their purpose, explain their choices and use organizers effectively; e.g., use webbing during a brainstorming activity to record thoughts in preparation for narrowing the topic use a compare and contrast map, such as a Venn diagram, for comparing and contrasting family traditions or when comparing and contrasting two versions of a story. Possible Student Learning Strategies: Cognitive Use word maps, mind maps, diagrams, charts or other graphic representations to make information easier to understand an d remember Look for patterns and relationships Use available technological aids to support language learning Social/Affective Participate actively in brainstorming and conferencing as prewriting and postwriting exercises For more information and blank templates ... Appendix D Spanish Language and Culture 9Y Guide to Implementation (7-9) Chapter 3 / 57 Alberta Education, Alberta, Canada 2010 Brainstorming Webs Brainstorming is effective for generating lists of ideas and creating interest and enthusiasm for new concepts or topics. Students can also use brainstorming to organize their knowledge and ideas. Info rmation gathered during brainstorming can serve as a starting point for more complex tasks, such as projects, outlines, mind maps or decision making. Tips for Brainstorming 1. Accept all statements. Emphasize quantity rather than quality. 2. Prohibit criticism\u2014all ideas are accepted no matter how outrageous or far-fetched. 3. Do not allow discussion except for clarification. 4. Encourage participants to build on others' ideas. 5. Set a time limit. 6. First generate ideas and th en combine and order them. 7. Brainstorming in Spanish may not be possible un til students develop a level of proficiency that allows them to express their ideas. Concept Map Concept mapping can help students visua lize how ideas are connected and lead to understanding of linguistic relationships and how know ledge is organized. The concept mapping process can improve students' oral communication, comprehension and problem-solving skills. Concept maps identify key ideas to be learned and can be used to facilitate the learning of these key ideas, to review subject matter or to summarize a unit or a lesson. When developing a concept map, the teacher and students identify a set of concepts associated with a selected topic. Concepts are ranked in related groups from general to specific. Related concepts are connected and the links can th en be clarified with pictures and visuals or with Spanish words, phrases or sentences. Decision Making (PMI Chart) Students can use Plus, Minus and Interesti ng information (PMI charts) to compare and contrast situations, ideas or positions. PMI charts give students a format for organizing information and evaluating their knowledge and ideas. For more information, see the PMI chart instructions in Appendix D. Decision Making (What I Have, What I Need) A decision-making model such as What I Have , What I Need offers a step-by-step process that encourages students to look for more than one solution, choose the best alternative and develop an action pl an for implementing their decision. By breaking down decision making into specific steps and taking the time to generate a variety of possible decisions, students at any grade level can become better, more creative decision makers . Flowchart Flowcharts graphically depict a sequence of events, actions, roles or decisions. They foster the development of logical and sequential thinking and promote the development of organizational and plan ning skills. Flowcharts can provide a useful outline for writing.

Appendix D 58 / Chapter 3 Spanish Language and Culture 9Y Guide to Implementation (7-9) 2010 Alberta Education, Alberta, Canada Idea Builders Idea builders create a context for introduci ng or clarifying new concepts, such as developing an understanding of a particular value. They are especially helpful for English as a second language students or st udents with special needs who require support in understanding new concepts. Idea builders encourage students to: make connections between what they know and what they will be learning gather information related to a concept by identifying essential and nonessential characteristics or examples examine concepts from multiple perspectives develop inductive and divergent thinking focus their attention on relevant details. KWL Charts KWL is a brainstorming strategy that en courages students to be active learners. Students begin by creating a chart with three columns. In the first column, students record the information they already Know about the topic. In the second column, students write a list of questions they Want to answer about the topic (these questions provide the focus for reading). In the third column, students record the information they have Learned about the topic. Tips for Using KWL Charts 1. Students read or listen to a text or watch a visual presentation. List on the board, under \"what we Know,\" information students know or think they know about a selected topic. Next list questions students want to answer about the topic under \"what we Want to know.\" 2. While researching, participating in a field trip or otherwise investigating a topic, students are asked to keep in mind the information listed under \"what we Want to know.\" 3. After the investigation, students identify what they learned, and that information is listed under \"what we Learned.\" Students complete the activity by contrasting the information listed under \"what we Learned\" with that listed under \"what we Want to know.\" 4. Information gathered in a KWL chart can facilitate learning log reflections and goal setting for students. Mind Maps Mind maps are an easy way to represent ideas by using key words, colours and imagery. Their nonlinear format helps students generate, organize and see connections among ideas. Mind maps integrate logical and imaginative thinking and create an overview of what students know and think about a topic. Webs are simple mind maps. Adding pictures, colour s and key words transforms them into more powerful tools for learning, for remembering and for generating ideas. Story Maps Story maps are graphic representations of key story elements: character, plot, problem or goal, mood, setting, theme and resolution. They provide visual outlines that help students understand story elemen ts and plot development and remember story content. For a blank template ... Appendix D For a blank template ... Appendix D For more information ... Appendix D Spanish Language and Culture 9Y Guide to Implementation (7-9) Chapter 3 / 59 Alberta Education, Alberta, Canada 2010 sour spicy Tips for Story Map Activities 1. Review the key story elements: plot, character, mood, setting, conflict, theme and resolution. These elements can be recorded on an overhead or the board in chart form or in the form of a story map. 2. Students listen to or read a story or view a movie. Provide students with a template for a story map. Students fill in the key informatio n as you model the process. Remind students that only the major events are to be recorded. 3. Model with older students how to use the key information to determine the theme. Have students record the theme in the appropriate space on the story map. Once students are familiar with story maps, they will be ready to use them on their own to analyze stories they read or movies they view. Triple T-chart T-charts can be used to help student s organize their knowledge and ideas and see relationships between pieces of information. T-charts can have two, three or more columns. As students explore core values, T-charts can be used to create visual pictures of what those values look, sound and feel like. T-charts can also be used to explore social issues, compare and contrast different situations, or investigate two or more aspects of any character and citizenship topic. Venn Diagram A Venn diagram provides an effective fram ework for comparing and contrasting. For more information, see the Venn diagram instructions in Appendix D.

Before assigning roles, review the task and determine what roles are necessary for the group to be successful. Roles could include the following: Checker Ensures that everyone understands the work in progress. Encourager Encourages everyone in the group to cont ribute, and offers positive feedback on ideas. Materials Manager Gathers the materials necessary to complete the task. At the end of the task, the materials manager returns the materials and turns in the group's work. Observer Completes a checklist of skills and strategies used by the group. Questioner Seeks information and opinions from other members of the group. Recorder Keeps a written record of the work completed. Reporter Reports on the group's work to the rest of the class. Timekeeper Watches the clock and makes sure the group finishes the task within the time allotted. When introducing roles to the class, explain and model them. Give students opportunities to practise them. Emphasize that all roles are equally important and contribute to the success of the group. Cooperative learning creates opportunities for students to learn and apply important social and communication skills . It enhances perspective, encourages higher-level reasoning, creates social support and provides opportunities for students to participate in meaningful, thoughtful activity. Random Roles Pass out role cards to each group member or distribute coloured candy, shapes, buttons, beans or any collection of objects, where each object represents a particular role. Group Assessment There is some debate regarding the assignment of a group mark for cooperative learning activities. Spencer Kagan argues against using a group achievement mark for the following reasons. If grades are partially a function of forces out of students' control, such as who happens to be in their group, that sends students the wrong message. Group marks violate individual accountability if individual students find ways to manipulate situations to their advantage. Group achievement marks are responsible for parent, teacher and student resistance to cooperative learning. Group Assessment: Adapted from Spencer Kagan, \"Group Grades Miss the Mark,\" Educational Leadership 52, 8 (May 1995), pp. 70, 71. Used with permission. The Association for Supervision and Curriculum Development is a worldwide community of educators advocating sound policies a nd sharing best practices to achieve the succe ss of each learner.

Chapter 7 Spanish Language and Culture 9Y Guide to Implementation (7-9) Chapter 3 / 61 Alberta Education, Alberta, Canada 2010 Rather than awarding group achievement marks, Kagan suggests providing feedback in written form on students' c ooperative learning skills. Kagan believes students will work hard if they know in adva nce that such feedback will occur. To promote student learning and to improve st udents' social skills, he also suggests asking students to set their own goals and to use self-assessment. Independent Study Independent study can develop skills th at enable students to become lifelong learners. The student or the teacher ma y initiate independent study activities that develop sound independent study habits. Students may work with a partner as part of a small group or alone. Independent study activities can be used as a major instructional strategy with the whole class, or in combination with other strategies. Such activities can be used with one or more individuals while the rest of the class is involved with another strategy. Possible Student Learning Strategies: Cognitive Find information, using reference materials such as dictionaries or textbooks Metacognitive Be aware of you r stren gths and weaknesses, identify you r needs and goals, and organize strategies and procedures accordingly Keep a learning log Make choices about how you learn Tip for Independent Study Assessment of the abilities st udents already possess is important before independent study begins. Specific challenges can be incorporated into independent study assignments to build upon and further develop individual capabilities. Information Gap Activities In information gap activities, students exchange information to solve a problem, gather information or make decisions. These activities can be done in pairs, be teacher-led or involve groups of students. They may be highly structured or fairly open-ended and are often used to reinfo rce previously learned vocabulary and structures. Ideally, information gap activities are as close to real life as possible, using questions and answers the same as or similar to those found in real-life situations. Students will then have a purpose for exchanging information; e.g., a task to complete, a puzzle to solve or a decision to make. Possible Student Learning Strategies: Social/Affective Work with others to solve problems and get feedback on tasks Interactive Indicate lack of understanding verbally or nonverbally For more information ... Chapter 5 Independent Study 62 / Chapter 3 Spanish Language and Culture 9Y Guide to Implementation (7-9) 2010 Alberta Education, Alberta, Canada Information Gap Activity Example 1. Organize students in pairs, and identify an d review vocabulary and structures that are needed to complete the activity. The activity could use a basic question structure and the vocabulary associated with the objects found in a classroom, e.g., shopping, ordering in a restaurant. 2. Provide Student A with a picture depicting a familiar scene, such as the inside of a classroom. Provide Student B with a picture of the same scene with some alterations; e.g., objects added or missing. Students ask each other questions in Spanish to determine which objects are missing from their own picture. Students sketch in objects they discover are missing from their own picture. Once comp lete, students assess th e accuracy of their communication by comparing their pictures. 3. Circulate through the classroom while the activity is in process. Record anecdotal notes of how each individual is demonstrating the development of skills in relation to the defined learning outcome(s). Notes should be ongoing through several classes to allow for tracking of skill development and identification of an y challenges a student might encounter. Interviews and Surveys Interviews and surveys can be conducted on almost any topic and aim to facilitate the development of the language through app lication. They can be used to collect information from a defined sample of pe ople in order to determine and report the frequency of particular responses to specific questions. Information collected may be strictly factual (e.g., month and year of birth, number of people in the family) or it could be more subjective (e.g., likes and dislikes, opinions on a specific topic). Simple factual surveys are recommended for beginners. Possible Student Learning Strategies: Interactive Interpret and use a variety of nonverbal cues to communicate Ask for clarification or repetition if you do not understand Tips for Interviews and Surveys 1. Prepare : Review the procedure with the class. Expl icit teaching or review of structures for asking questions may be needed. 2. Plan: Collaboratively decide the purpose of the interview or survey and if questions will be oral or written. Formulate questions to ask, choose the sample of people to survey and divide the work among the students. 3. Collect Data : The interview/survey is conducted in the manner agreed upon; e.g., in-person interview, survey by phone or e-mail, survey on paper. 4. Organize and Display Data : Once data has been collected, it should be compiled and displayed. Results are often displayed by using a graph. The type of graph used will vary with the age and mathematical understanding of the students. With advanced planning, an interview/survey activity can be integr ated with a topic from mathematics class.b 5. Summarize, Analyze and Interpret Data : For simple factual interview/survey results, these steps are relatively easy. If information about opinions or values has been gathered, there is more opportunity for discussion and differing interpretations. Students may present their interpretations orally or in writing. Spanish Language and Culture 9Y Guide to Implementation (7-9) Chapter 3 / 63 Alberta Education, Alberta, Canada 2010 Language Ladders Creating language ladders is an effective strategy for teaching essential classroom language. Essential language phrases are di rectly taught. These phrases usually represent a series of different ways to express a similar idea or need, often in different registers, degrees of politeness or social context; e.g., the questions and answers necessary when eating out, shopping or travelling. Language ladders are posted on the wall with accompanying visual cues, and language phrases are always grouped (like the rungs of a ladder) to show their relationships and to assist students in remembering their meanings. Example A: Help Expressions Excuse me, teacher! Can you help me, please ? Excuse me, can anybody help me ? Hello! I need help, please. Hey you! Help me. Help!

Possible Student Learning Strategies: Cognitive Group together sets of things\u2014vocabulary, structures\u2014with similar characteristics Use word maps, mind maps, diagrams, charts or other graphic representations to make information easier to understand and remember Productive Use words that are visible in the immediate environment 64 / Chapter 3 Spanish Language and Culture 9Y Guide to Implementation (7-9) 2010 Alberta Education, Alberta, Canada Learning Logs A learning log is usually a single notebook with various sections that provides places for students to journal (reflect) and log (record with purpose). Students record their personal reflections , questions, ideas, words or expressions to remember, or the feelings they have ab out experiences in class. Ideally, such reflective thinking and writing is done on a regular basis and the teacher responds with oral or written advice, comments and observations. Learning logs are usually more objective, providing a place to record observations on learning activities, lists of books read or films watched, or notes on learning strategies. Until students develop an appropriate leve l of proficiency in Spanish and in reflective thinking and writing, they will need teacher guidance and will likely reflect in English. The transition to using more Spanish a nd more independent reflection is made over time. Once the transition is made, reflecting becomes a strong and meaningful context for students' Spanish use. If students have little experience in reflec tive writing, it is a good idea to model the process by doing a collective journal on la rge chart paper. Begin by discussing the reasons for keeping a journal and ways the journal can be used, so students understand the process and the purpose. Tips for Learning Logs 1. Ask specific questions to guide students. Provide suggestions for topics. 2. Provide regular opportunities for students to write in their learning logs (reflective section)\u2014 perhaps a few minutes before or after an activity or at the end of each week. 3. Students choose whether or not to share their journal entries with the teacher or their fellow students. If students decide to share part or all of their journals , teachers can respond individually with questions or comments to extend thinking. Since the primary purpose of a journal is not to practise writing, teachers should not correct the grammar, spelling or punctuation in student journals. 4. Encourage students to regularly re read what they have written in their journals and reflect on what they have written. 5. If students are having difficulty expressing their thoughts in words, suggest that they add drawings or other visual representations to express meaning. Students benefit from discussion about what they are learning, why they need to know specific aspects of the language or culture, and how they are learning. The discussion helps students develop the language they need to write effectively about their learning. Encourage students to retell, relate and reflect by looking back, looking in and looking forward. For more information ... Chapter 7 Learning Logs Spanish Language and Culture 9Y Guide to Implementation (7-9) Chapter 3 / 65 Alberta Education, Alberta, Canada 2010 Looking back (Retell) What activities did we do ? What did I learn ? What strategies did I use during the activities ? Looking in (Relate) What did I like or dislike about the learning experience ? How does what I learned relate to what I already knew ? What questions or concerns do I have about what I learned ? Looking forward (Reflect) What would I like to learn more about ? What goals could I set for myself ? How might what I learned help me in the future ? Possible Student Learning Strategies: Metacognitive Reflect on learning tasks with the guidance of the teacher Reflect on the listening, speaking, reading and writing process Keep a learning log Be aware of your strengths and weaknesses, identify your needs and goals, and organize strategies and procedures accordingly Mini-lessons Short lessons can efficiently deliver small amounts of information to students, such as aspects of culture or a grammatical structure. Mini-lessons are effective when they are limited to 10-15 minutes. Incorporate group discussion and/or demonstrations and feature visual aids such as overhead transparencies or posters. Possible Student Learning Strategies: Cognitive Listen attentively Metacognitive Listen or read for key words Be aware of the potential of learning through direct exposure to the language Turn and Talk Have students turn to a neighbouring stud ent and discuss the mini-lesson they have just heard. Have them summarize the content of the lesson, using a graphic organizer such as a concept map, a Venn diagram or a flowchart. Specify the organizer that best suits the topic or th e content of the lesson, or discuss with students which graphic organizer they think would work best and why. Discuss the resulting summaries as a class, and collaboratively develop a master organizer summary on the board. 66 / Chapter 3 Spanish Language and Culture 9Y Guide to Implementation (7-9) 2010 Alberta Education, Alberta, Canada Reading Instructional Strategies Author's Chair During author's chair activities, students read aloud their written drafts or compositions to their classmates. Li steners provide positive comments and constructive feedback to the author to assist future writing efforts. Writing is usually shared with the entire class, but occasionally authors read to small groups. A special chair or area of the classroom may be designated for this activity. Tips for Author's Chair 1. Have the author face the audience and read a draft or completed composition. Have the author share accompanying illustrations and ex planations with the audience. The audience uses active listening skills to convey respect for, and acceptance of, the author's efforts. 2. Have the author request comments or feedback about the piece from the audience. Encourage audience members to make positive comments related to the events, characters or specific language used in the wr iting. Encourage the author to ask questions about the clarity and effectiveness of the writin g as well as the use of language. Have the audience offer suggestions for revision or considerations for future work. Comprehension Students learn comprehension skills and strategies in a variety of situations while accessing different levels of text and diff erent text types. The focus of guided comprehension is on direction, inst ruction, application and reflection. To assist with student comprehension, provide focused instruction of comprehension skills and strategies such as: previewing self-questioning making links to self, text and others visualizing using graphophonic (i.e., recognizing lette rs and their sounds), syntactic and semantic cueing systems monitoring, summarizing and evaluating. Read-aloud During read-alouds, read to the whole class or to a small group, using material that is at the listening comprehension level of the students. The content of the reading may focus on a topic related to a curriculu m outcome in another subject area, such as mathematics, science or social studies. Reading aloud to students helps them deve lop a love of good literature, motivation to pursue reading on their own and familiarity with a variety of genres, including nonfiction. It provides them with new vocabulary and contributes to their oral and written language development. Reading al oud should occur frequently to stimulate students' interest in books and reading. Spanish Language and Culture 9Y Guide to Implementation (7-9) Chapter 3 / 67 Alberta Education, Alberta, Canada 2010 Readers' Theatre In readers' theatre, students read aloud from existing scripts, adapted scripts or scripts they have written themselves. The performance requires minimal costumes, props or sets, and the texts do not have to be memorized. Readers' theatre, however, is very effective in the classroom as it does the following: It requires the students to truly understand the text in order to find the mood, action and characterization of the story. It develops skills such as cooperation and risk taking. It develops oral skills such as pronunc iation, articulation, projection and expression. It provides an opportunity for all levels of students to participate, as roles can be of varying lengths and difficulties. It develops writing skills if students wr ite their own scripts or adapt existing stories, poems or plays. It improves listening skills, as students must know when it is their turn to read and what action they are to perform. It develops imagination and creativity, as students, not the set, costumes or props, must create the story in the minds of the listeners. It creates less anxiety, as the whole text does not need to be memorized. It allows casting that is not gender specific, as one reader can perform several roles or even become animals or things. It permits large roles, such as the narra tor, to be shared by more than one student. Tips for Readers' Theatre Activities 1. Choose an existing script. These are not easy to find in Spanish so you will have to adapt a story or a poem for the class. It is wise to choose a story that has a clear plot, with actions or descriptions that can be easily mimed, well defined characters and a good balance between narration and dialogue and that allows for a fairly equitable participation by all students. 2. Put each script into a 3-hole folder. As the scripts can be used as props, ensure that the colour, design and size of the folders do not detract from the story. 3. When the roles are cast, ask each reader to hi ghlight his or her lines with a highlighter. 4. Have all performers, except the narrator, sit on a stool, preferably one that rotates to aid entrances and exits. Narrators often stand with their script placed on a music stand or a podium. 5. Train the readers to use offstage focus when they read. This involves their looking out at the audience and reading towards an imaginary sp ot located in the centre of and slightly above the heads of the audience. If the students use onstage focus and do it poorly, they merely look like actors who have not memorized their lines. Offstage focus also cuts down on giggling by adolescents who are looking at each other. Offstage focus forces the readers to read well enough to create the story in the mind's eye of the audience. Narrators can either face the audience or the actors depending on what they are saying. 6. Have students get into groups and rehearse their text. Circulate and assist in the direction of the production; student directors can also be used. Remind students to listen carefully to the narrator and to mime the actions or descriptions he or she is reading. Ask the readers to find a character for their role as well as a voice, a body stance etc. in order to make their personage come alive for the audience even though they are merely sitting on a stool and reading. 68 / Chapter 3 Spanish Language and Culture 9Y Guide to Implementation (7-9) 2010 Alberta Education, Alberta, Canada 7. Entrances and exits of characters are easily made by turning on the stools, especially if one student is playing several roles. A back to th e audience indicates that the character is not present at that time. Organize as well an orderly entrance and exit of all readers on the stage or playing area. 8. Be especially vigilant to ensure that the scripts in their folders do not distract from the reading by being opened or cl osed unnecessarily, by being dropped etc. 9. After some experience with prepared scripts, students (especially those whose knowledge of Spanish may be slightly more advanced) can be asked to adapt stories or write their own scripts. 10. Share the performances with others. 11. Enjoy the experience! A variation on the traditional approach to readers' theatre is to consider using a VoiceThread. VoiceThread is a free online tool ( http://voicethread.com ) that allows users to upload a document or imag e and use the record feature to perform the readers' theatre. This online tool has positive implications for second language learners. Shared Reading In shared reading, guide the whole class or a small group in reading enlarged text that all the students can see; e.g., a big book, an overhead, a chart or a poster. The text can be read several times, first fo r the students and then with the students joining in. Shared reading involves active participation and considerable interaction on the part of students and teachers. Shared reading provides an opportunity to model effective reading, promote listening comprehension, teach vocabular y, reinforce letter-sound relationships and concepts about books and print, and build background knowledge on a range of subjects. Storytelling Storytelling activities provide opportunities for students to tell stories by using their own language rather than reading from a text. Students may retell familiar stories, or they may choose to tell stories they have read or written. An alternative to conventional storytelling is to use digital storytelling. There is an abundance of emerging storytelling tools th at can be used in the second language classroom. For example, the StoryTools Web site (http://cogdogroo.wikispaces.com/StoryTools ) provides a list of 50 open source storytelling tools that are easy to use when presenting a story. Spanish Language and Culture 9Y Guide to Implementation (7-9) Chapter 3 / 69 Alberta Education, Alberta, Canada 2010 Total Physical Response Storytelling In total physical response (TPR) storytelli ng, students use the vocabulary they have recently learned in the context of en tertaining, content-rich stories. Possible Student Learning Strategies: Interpretive Use gestures, intonation and visual supports to aid comprehension Listen or look for key words Productive Use nonverbal means to communicate Tips for TPR Storytelling 1. Practise and Teach Vocabulary : Have students learn a selected group of vocabulary words through association with particular actions. Practise these actions with the students. 2. Produce and Practise Vocabulary : Once students know the vocabulary, have them pair up. One student reads the word and the other provides the corresponding gesture. Partners reverse roles and repeat. 3. Perform a Story : Narrate a story that uses the various vocabulary words. As you narrate the story, students will listen and perform the actions to the vocabulary words when they hear them. 4. Review the Story : Ask students for their interpretations of the story they have just performed. 5. Retell and Revise (Advanced) : Students build upon the story, using their existing language skills to embellish the plot, personalize the characters and create revisions. 6. Create Original Stories (Advanced) : Students prepare and act out original stories, using the selected vocabulary. Reflective Discussions Reflective discussions encourage students to think and talk about what they have observed, heard or read. The teacher or student initiates the discussion by asking a question that requires students to reflect upon and interpret films, experiences, stories or illustrations. As students discuss information and events, they clarify their thoughts and feelings. The questions posed should encourage students to relate text content to life experiences and to other texts. Interpretations will vary, but such variances demonstrate that di fferences of opinion are valuable. Research Projects Students may be involved in research projects individually, as partners or as members of small groups. Research pr ojects are effective in developing and extending language skills. While doing research, students practise reading for specific purposes, recording information, sequencing and organizing ideas, and using language to inform others. Research projects can motivate students through active participation, greatly increasing understanding and retention. St udents teach one another by describing what they are doing. These projects ask students to use inductive reasoning. Students can also reflect on their experien ces and apply what they have learned to other contexts. 70 / Chapter 3 Spanish Language and Culture 9Y Guide to Implementation (7-9) 2010 Alberta Education, Alberta, Canada A research model can be used to provide students with a framework for organizing information about a topic. Possible Student Learning Strategies: Cognitive Use previously acquired knowledge to facilitate a learning task Use available technological aids to support language learning Use word maps, mind maps, diagrams, charts or other graphic representations to make information easier to understand and remember Interpretive Prepare questions or a guide to note information found in a text Role-play Children naturally use make-believe to expl ore roles and situations that they cannot experience directly. Role-play and simulati on use this natural learning strategy to explore different aspects of various topics. In role-play, students assume a role (a character, a real-life or an imaginary person, or an animal) and are placed in a situation or context. They act as if they were someone or something else. They experiment with what it feels like to be in someone else's shoes and, ideally, develop empathy for that character. Some props may be used, but generally th ere are no sets, costumes or makeup. Role-play may or may not involve writing a skit and then reading it or memorizing it for presentation. As students gain experi ence in role-play, they can take a more active role in planning and guiding the role-play activity. Role-play is best used at the reinforc ement or review stage of learning when students have a fairly good command of the vocabulary and structures but need some practice using them in relatively unstructured situations. Possible Student Learning Strategies: Metacognitive Rehearse or role-play language Productive Use knowledge of sentence patterns to form new sentences Tips for Role-play 1. Outline the Situation : Start by describing a problem to be solved, a conflict to be resolved or a situation involving an unforeseen element. An element of tension can draw students in and impel them to respond and take action. Begin by using fairly routine situations; e.g., asking for directions, ordering a meal in a restaurant or buying something in a store. 2. Provide Time : Give students time to explore/research their characters' backgrounds, beliefs, habits and opinions before they ac tually perform the role-play. 3. Teacher Involvement : Assume roles such as chairperson or spokesperson, guide the role-play and encourage students to participate. 4. Reflection : Provide a period of reflection following the role-play. Students describe what they experienced and how they felt. Guide th e discussion by asking questions and making comments, encouraging the students to think about their experiences. Students may also respond by drawing pictures to express their reactions. Spanish Language and Culture 9Y Guide to Implementation (7-9) Chapter 3 / 71 Alberta Education, Alberta, Canada 2010 Sharing Circle In sharing circle activities, the teacher an d students sit in a circle and share their thoughts on events and experiences. Sharing circles encourage students' participation as they develop oral la nguage and gain confidence through the sharing of personal responses and ideas. It is important that the rules for shari ng circles be discussed prior to the first sharing circle, such as \"accept all ideas,\" \"do not insult anyone,\" \"ask questions if you don't understand,\" \"be sure to be ab le to see all members of the circle.\" Tips for Sharing Circle Activities 1. Sit comfortably in a circle with students so that everyone can see and participate. 2. Model the expectations and procedures before individual students begin to share their feelings about an event or experience . Validate all student responses. 3. It is acceptable for students to pass rather than give a response. Studen ts take turns until all the students who wish to speak have spoken. Sketch to Stretch Sketch to stretch (Short, Harste and Burk e 1996) is a strategy that allows students to represent through drawing what they learned during reading, viewing or listening. Students who are not risk-takers often experience success with this strategy, and the strategy provides an opportunity for students with different learning styles to respond in different ways. Students see that others have different interpretations of a selection, and ne w meanings and insights are gained. Tips for Sketch to Stretch 1. Students read, view or listen to a selection, either in a small group or as a class. 2. Explain to students that they can repres ent meaning in a variety of ways and can experiment with different ways to represent mean ing. Students think ab out what the story or video meant to them and draw a sketch. 3. Students share their sketches with their classmates. Give the students an opportunity to discuss the sketches and ask questions. Slim Jims Slim Jims are long, narrow pieces of paper that students use to record notes. Categories or headings relating to the to pic are chosen and written on the paper. Details are recorded in point form as single words or simple phrases under the appropriate heading. This decreases the likelihood that students will copy whole sentences from reference material. The notes can then be used to write such things as reports, summaries and oral presentations. 72 / Chapter 3 Spanish Language and Culture 9Y Guide to Implementation (7-9) 2010 Alberta Education, Alberta, Canada Visual Imaging The practice of imaging or mentally visua lizing objects, events or situations is a powerful skill that assists students to constr uct meaning as they listen and read. As students read and listen to others, they incorporate their knowledge and previous experiences to form images of situations, settings, characters and events. These images extend students' comprehension, en rich their personal interpretations and stimulate unique ideas for oral expression and/or writing. Imaging provides an opportunity for students to vicariously experience what they hear, read and write. Word Building Activities Word building activities should be based on relevant vocabulary collected from reading, environmental print or lexical fields. A simple word building activity involves taking the letters from a longer word and scrambling them. Students then rearrange the letters to create smaller words that they record as they try to figure out the big word. Once a number of words have been generated and the big word has been unscrambled, students can use th e words they have generated in word analysis activities. Flash Cards Most vocabulary words are learned throu gh meaningful experiences (e.g., reading, environmental print), but it is still useful to spend some time working with words on flash cards. Initially, flash cards should display the words and associated pictures side by side, but later the flash cards can have pictures on the backs and then have no pictures at all. Students could also match word cards with picture cards. Flash cards are often used to teach nouns but can also be used for teaching verbs and adjectives. They should not be used to teach high-frequency words in isolation, as meaningful context is essential. Possible Student Learning Strategies: Cognitive Use mental images to remember new information Memorize new words by repeating them silently or aloud Place new words or expressions in a context to make them easier to remember For more information ... Appendix B Vocabulary and Classroom Expressions Spanish Language and Culture 9Y Guide to Implementation (7-9) Chapter 3 / 73 Alberta Education, Alberta, Canada 2010 Making Words Make word cards for long or difficult words by dividing the words into short syllables (e.g., des a for tu na da men te ). In order, point to each letter, make its sound and slide it into place until the word is formed. Repeat this action a couple of times, speeding up each time until the sounds run together and you are practically saying the word normally. Have students repeat your actions. Possible Student Learning Strategies: Metacognitive Make a plan in advance about how to approach a learning task Evaluate your performance or comprehension at the end of a task Cognitive Look for patterns and relationships Personal Dictionaries Personal dictionaries consist of words that are familiar and significant to individual students. Word sources include dictated stories and captions, journals and other writing efforts, as well as the students' own oral vocabulary. For language learning, personal word banks or collecti ons of key words are valuable resources for expanding students' reading and writing vocabularies. A personal dictionary could be developed throughout the year and kept in a section of the students' learning logs. Personal dictionaries should be organized alpha betically or by lexical field. Each entry in a personal dictionary should include a picture, a cognate, an example of its correct usage or a translation if necessary. Possible Student Learning Strategies: Cognitive Make personal dictionaries Place new words or expressions in a context to make them easier to remember Metacognitive Check copied writing for accuracy Word Walls To create an environment rich in la nguage, create a word wall that reflects developing vocabulary. Post the words in a way that allows them to be removed for reference or reorganization; e.g., stic ky notes. Use the word wall as part of regular language learning activities. For ex ample, add a word whenever a student asks for the meaning of an unfamiliar word or seeks a word to help express himself or herself. Organize and reorganize the wall based on the instructional focus; e.g., organize by spelling pattern, lexical field, meaning, usage. Possible Student Learning Strategies: Cognitive Group together sets of things\u2014vocabulary, structures\u2014with similar characteristics Productive Use words that are visible in the immediate environment 74 / Chapter 3 Spanish Language and Culture 9Y Guide to Implementation (7-9) 2010 Alberta Education, Alberta, Canada Portable Word Pockets Create an extra copy of each word posted on the word wall and store these extra copies in an envelope or pouch under a heading (e.g., parts of the body, foods, clothing). Encourage the students to u se these words for sorting activities or for reference. Using Technology in the Classroom Information and communication technologies (ICT) are processes, tools and techniques that affect the way we can communicate, inquire, make decisions and solve problems. While computer-assisted language learning has been used for years by language teachers to supplement face-to-face language learning, there recently has been a plethora of emerging assistive technologies that are web-based and open-sourced; i.e., anyone can change or share them, and they are widely available. These Web 2.0 tools have grea tly added to the list of ICT skills and processes that have typically been addr essed by technology in the classroom. Current ICT Skills and Processes Addre ssed by Technology in the Classroom gathering and identifying information classifying and organizing summarizing and synthesizing analyzing and evaluating speculating and predicting communicating information conversing with students in other classes connecting building community The recent development of Web 2.0 tools has shifted the paradigm from \"learning from technology\" to \"learning with technology.\" Effective use of Web 2.0 tools, e.g., blogs, wikis, Skype, podcasting, can increase a language learner's ability to collaborate and communicate in the target language. These tools can provide opportunities for students to hone their use of vocabulary and can extend students' working understanding of the target la nguage by allowing them access to more authentic environments and contexts with in which to practise the language. The ICT skills and processes that students develop through the use of Web 2.0 tools and other technology in the classroom can be re lated to learning strategies included in the program of studies. Spanish Language and Culture 9Y Guide to Implementation (7-9) Chapter 3 / 75 Alberta Education, Alberta, Canada 2010 ICT Skills and Processes Learning Strategy Examples gathering and identifying information find information, using reference materials classifying and organizing group together sets of things\u2014vocabulary, structures\u2014with similar characteristics summarizing and synthesizing use word maps, mind maps, diagrams, charts and other graphic representations to make information easier to understand and remember collaborate collaborate with students on language learning projects regardless of geographical distance communicate communicate with others connect connect with students in target language communities build community build networks of students who have similar needs and interests ICT Curriculum in Spanish Language and Culture Classrooms Spanish language and culture students meet communication outcomes from the ICT curriculum as they access information in Spanish through the Internet and as they exchange information and seek s upport for, and validation of, their ideas through e-mails, chat rooms and discussion forums. Under the guidance and direction of thei r teachers, Spanish language and culture students meet foundational operations and knowledge outcomes by using ICT tools in appropriate ways and by understanding what tools are best for specific tasks. For example, by using a Web 2.0 tool like SlideFlickr ( http://www.slideflickr.com ) to present a language project, students demonstrate knowledge of a specific tool or technology and use it in an effective way; e.g., students can create and embed Flickr slide shows. Students can provide a written or an audio accompaniment on a topic that is of personal interest to them. Information and communication technologies not only allow teachers and students to use tools to enhance and/or support the learning of Spanish, they also provide opportunities for teachers and students to expand communication horizons that bring cultures and worlds together. Digital tools and applications such as blogs, wikis, videoconferencing, podcasts, Skype, mailing list servers and discussion boards are particularly effective in this regard. 76 / Chapter 3 Spanish Language and Culture 9Y Guide to Implementation (7-9) 2010 Alberta Education, Alberta, Canada Teacher- and Student-oriented ICT Integration Teachers are encouraged to consider differ ent methods of integrating ICT in their planning and teaching; i.e., teacher-ori ented integration and student-oriented integration. Activities in this guide have been written so that those which incorporate ICT tools can easily be adjusted to meet the various realities of Alberta classrooms. Teachers are in the best position to judge which ICT tools will be most effective in their classrooms. Teac hers should consider carefully the amount of time and effort required to achieve a stat ed outcome within an activity, and then focus on two to three tools per grade. Consistent practice will help students become comfortable with the tools. Teacher-oriented Integration As teachers face the challenges of meeting students' diverse needs and creating the best possible learning experiences for st udents, ICT tools and devices can be a useful support. ICT tools, such as data bases and spreadsheets, allow teachers to plan and track student progress. Co mmunicating with students is facilitated through e-mail, chat rooms and discussion forums. Electronically generated content can also be easily modified to meet the needs of individual students. Technology offers a wide range of po ssibilities for creating presentations with visual and audio components, and multimedia interactivity can be used to facilitate student practice and learning. Student-oriented Integration ICT, and Internet-based technologies in pa rticular, contribute to students' active participation in learning tasks and have great potential to enhance and extend the principles of good language instruction. Online journals, blogs, personal Web sites and shared content through digital devices are not just examples of how students can use technology for learning, they are also ways in which teachers can modify and adapt traditional language activities so as to harness the potential that Web 2.0 tools have to offer. The traditional exch anging of letters between students can be modified by using a tool such as ePals ( http://www.epals.com ). Students in Alberta can connect with Spanish-speaking students in Mexico and Latin America online at http://yourwebapps.com and engage in real-time group discussions. For live, conversational language speak ing opportunities, videoconferencing and Skype are two tools students can use. Web 2.0 tools like blogs, wikis, podcasts, Skype and videoconferencing provide students with opportunities to: connect with others outside the classr oom and inside the target language- speaking area reach a wider audience through online publishing link with others who have similar needs and interests, thereby increasing their chances of engaging in meaningful conversation in the target language and enriching the connection to the community of the target language use scaffolding to enhance lear ning and to solve problems provide feedback, reflection and revision build global and local communities.

Ideally, many activities that incorporate ICT tools should be long-term; i.e., half a year/year-long projects that different students can add to over time. Such projects allow for more passive students to practise, gain self-confidence and participate meaningfully. Again, it is the teacher who will decide how to best use ICT tools in lesson planning.

Students create a spoof of a weather report; i.e., a humorous script for a short weather report in Spanish and a multimedia presentation of their script. The report does not have to reflect reality and should aim to include as many kinds of weather as possible. Students film their report program or use digital images from an online weather image site (or use a digital camera to take their own pictures) and tape accompanying audio. Students use Movie Maker, Photo Story, iMovie or Animoto to make their final weather report project. 1. Students work in small groups to research possible weather conditions from Spanish speaking locations ( http://espanol.weather.com/ ) and, based on their research, create a short weather report script that includes a variety of weather conditions. 2. Students use an online image/video clip site to locate relevant weather images and video clips ( http://tinyurl.com/nsqt or http://www.youtube.com/ ) and/or take their own digital pictures. Hint: It might save students time if teachers create an image/video clip bank for students to use for this project. 3. Students upload images or film clips to Movie Maker, Photo Story, iMovie or Animoto. Using their weather report script, students narrate their weather program in Spanish and film this narration for their weather program (for use in Movie Maker or iMovie) or tape the audio for use with digital pictures (for use in Photo Story).

Research in the field of cognitive psycholo gy suggests that the differences between students who are successful and students w ho struggle may be related in part to what students understand about the learning process. From this perspective, learning is a knowledge domain, similar to science or history. The more knowledge a student has about how to learn, the more efficient his or her learning is likely to be. This knowledge includes an understanding of when and how to use cognitive strategies\u2014tactics that support lear ners as they develop and internalize procedures for performing higher-level tasks. Cognitive strategies encourage students to take ownership of their own learning. Teaching cognitive strategies can help students with learning difficu lties become more active and purposeful learners, thinkers and problem solvers. Chapter 4 Students with Special Education Needs 94 / Chapter 4 Spanish Language and Culture 9Y Guide to Implementation (7-9) 2010 Alberta Education, Alberta, Canada Strategy instruction is initially teach er-driven, with the teacher providing structured opportunities for students to learn, practise and develop strategies; however, students should be encouraged to become aware of and monitor their own strategic processes as much as possible. Students need to know the purpose and limitations of the strategies, as well as when and where to use different strategies, so that they can eventually l earn to rely on themselves, rather than on the teacher. Consider the following guidelines for teaching cognitive learning strategies: Match strategies to the requirements of the learning task. For example, if the goal of the learning task involves retaining the main ideas in a piece of factual writing, the student might be directed to use a chunking strategy to increase the amount of information held in short-term memory. The strate gy must be developmentally appropriate for the student. Provide strategy instruction consistent with th e student's current knowledge and skill level. Provide opportunities for extensive practice in strategy use. Practice helps students to spontaneously produce th e strategy and apply the strategy across a wide range of content areas and situations. Students benefit fr om both guided and independent practice. Prompt students to use specific st rategies at appropriate times. Some students with learning difficulties may require explicit prompting to help develop their ability to transfer the strategy to different but related tasks (Gagn\u00e9 and Driscoll 1988). The Importance of Motivation One of the most important factors in de termining the rate and success of second language acquisition is motivation (Dor nyei and Csiz\u00e9r 1998). Even with appropriate curricula, good teaching and i nherent abilities, students cannot succeed without sufficient motivation. And, high motivation can make up for considerable difficulties in language aptitude. Often closely related to motivation is the issue of second language performance anxiety, in which previous negative expe riences in language and culture contexts create ongoing feelings of apprehension for students. Language learners who are overly anxious about their performance are of ten less motivated to perform in ways that bring attention to themselves in the classroom or in natural language-use settings. Language anxiety is associat ed with difficulties in listening comprehension, vocabulary acquisition a nd word production and with generally lower achievement in second language lear ning (Horwitz, Horwitz and Cope 1986; MacIntyre and Gardner 1991). Teachers might consider using the following sample strategies for improving and maintaining the motivation of students in the language and culture classroom. Spanish Language and Culture 9Y Guide to Implementation (7-9) Chapter 4 / 95 Alberta Education, Alberta, Canada 2010 1. Include a sociocultural component in classroom instruction. Show authentic films or video clips, and play culturally relevant music. Promote student contact with second language speakers by arranging meetings with individuals in the community, organizing field trips or exchange programs, or finding pen pals or e-mail friends for students. 2. Develop students' cross-cultural awareness. Focus on cross-cultural similarities and not just differences, using analogies to make the unknown familiar. Use culturally rich teaching ideas and activities. Discuss the role that second language learning plays in the world and its potential usefulness both for the students and their community. 3. Develop students' self-confidence and decrease anxiety. Provide regular encouragement and rein forcement. Highlight what students can do rather than what they cannot do. Create a supportive and accepting learning environment by encouraging the view that mistakes are a part of learning. Tell students about your own difficulties in language learning and share the strategies you have used to cope with these difficulties. Make sure that students regularly experience success and a sense of achievement. For example, break down t asks into smaller, more manageable units so that students experience success with each step. Balance students' experiences of frustration by providing easier activities, and complete confidence-building tasks before tackling more difficult tasks and concepts. Provide examples and descriptors of accomplishment. Point out the students' successes. 4. Help students increase their success. Help students link past difficulties to c ontrollable elements, such as confusion about what to do, insufficient effort or the use of inappropriate strategies, rather than to a lack of ability. Match the difficulty of tasks to students' abilities so that students can expect to succeed if they put in a reasonable effort. Encourage students to set their own goals that are achievable and specific; e.g., learning 10 new Spanish words every week. Teach students learning and communication strategies, as well as strategies for problem solving. 5. Increase students' interest and involvement in tasks. Design or select varied and challenging activities. Adapt tasks to students' interests, making sure that something ab out each activity is new or different. Include game-like features, such as puzzles, problem solving, overcoming obstacles, elements of suspense or hidden information. 96 / Chapter 4 Spanish Language and Culture 9Y Guide to Implementation (7-9) 2010 Alberta Education, Alberta, Canada Use imaginative elements that w ill engage students' emotions. Personalize tasks by encouraging students to engage in meaningful exchanges, such as sharing information, personal interests and experiences. Make peer interaction, e.g., pair work and group work, an important component of instructional organization. Break the routine by periodically changing the interaction pattern or seating plan. Use authentic, unusual or exotic texts, recordings and visual aids. 6. Increase the students' sense of satisfaction. Create opportunities for students to produ ce finished products that they can perform or display. For example, make a wall chart of what the group has learned and use it to celebrate successes. Provide students with authentic choices about alternative ways to complete tasks. Invite students to design and prepare activities themselves, and promote peer teaching. Show students that you value second language learning as a meaningful experience in your own life, sharing stories about your personal interests and experiences with second language learning. Connect tasks with things that student s already find satisfying or valuable. By providing students with learning experiences that create a sense of competence, enjoyment and belonging, teachers can in crease the motivation and success of all students. When motivation is combined with appropriate accommodations and differentiated instruction, students with sp ecial education needs can gain valuable knowledge, skills and experiences in the language and culture classroom. Characteristics of Students with Special Education Needs Each student with special education need s has an individual profile of abilities, needs, interests and learning preferences. Some students with special education needs are able to master the grade-level programs of study with differentiated instruction and support strategies. Ot her students have more complex learning needs that require significant changes to the learning outcomes in the grade-level programs of study. Students' special education needs can affect language learning in a variety of ways and have a variety of implications for classroom planning and instruction. For example, students may be less likely to participate in classroom discussion, may have difficulty formulating and expressing ideas, and may find the task of writing difficult and stressful. On the other hand , these students may have strengths in the visual domain and often benefit from the use of graphic organizers, charts and visual cues. Spanish Language and Culture 9Y Guide to Implementation (7-9) Chapter 4 / 97 Alberta Education, Alberta, Canada 2010 Individualized Program Plans (IPPs) Every student who is identified as having special education needs must have an Individualized Program Plan (IPP). This plan, usually coordinated by the student's classroom teacher, will contain information about the student's st rengths and needs, relevant medical history, services that might be needed, educational goals and objectives for the year, required accommodations and strategies, and plans for transitions. The language and culture teacher is a member of the student's learning team and should participate in the IPP process by providing feedback on the student's individual needs, strengths a nd progress and by discussing how target goals can be addressed in the second language classroom. A student's IPP can provide helpful in formation for planning and adapting instruction in the language and culture cl assroom. Any significant modifications of curriculum will be documented in the IPP. For example, a student with severe communication difficulties may have long-term goals such as establishing eye contact or initiating peer and adult inter actions, and would focus on social outcomes to achieve these goals. On the other hand, a student with reading difficulties may be able to achieve most outcomes from the grade-level program of studies, but other outcomes, such as those related to readi ng in a second language, may be modified. The IPP will also contain required accommodati ons and instructional strategies. An accommodation is a change or alteration in th e regular way a student is expected to learn, complete assignments or participate in classroom activities. Accommodations remove, or at least lessen, the impact of a student's special education needs and give him or her the same opportunity to succeed as other students. Once a student has been iden tified as having special education needs, accommodations should be considered to ensure that the student can access the curriculum and learn and demonstrate new knowledge to the best of his or her ability. The following accommodations are frequently used to support students with special education needs in grades 7 to 9. Arrange alternative seating; e.g., near teacher, facing teacher, at front of class, away from distractions. Allow more time for tasks or assignments. Reduce the volume of tasks required; e.g., fewer sentences to read, fewer vocabulary words. Reduce the demand for copying. Present fewer questions on a page, and provide more space for answers. Provide visual cues; e.g., draw arrows and stop signs on the student's paper to indicate what to do next or where to stop. Encourage the use of place markers, cue cards and writing templates. Encourage the use of a variety of writing in struments (e.g., pencil grips) and paper (e.g., graph paper, paper with lines, paper with raised lines). Allow the use of person al word lists or other print references. Provide checklists and/or picture cues of steps for longer tasks. Break tasks into small steps. For more information ...

Edmonton, AB: Alberta Learning, 2004. 98 / Chapter 4 Spanish Language and Culture 9Y Guide to Implementation (7-9) 2010 Alberta Education, Alberta, Canada Differentiated Instruction Individual students with special education needs may require specific accommodations in the language and culture classroom, but teachers can support the learning of all students\u2014particularly those with learning difficulties\u2014by incorporating elements of differentiated instruction. Many of these sample strategies will be beneficial for a number of students, not only students with special education needs. The term \"differentiation\" embraces a variety of instructional strategies that recognize and support individual differences in student learning. Differentiated instruction maximizes learning by consid ering students' individual and cultural learning styles, recognizing that some stude nts will require adjusted expectations and offering a variety of ways for students to explore curriculum content and demonstrate learning (as well as accepting that these different methods are of equal value). With differentiated instruction, th e teacher creates learning situations that match students' current abilities and learning preferences but also stretch their abilities and encourage them to try new ways of learning. Differentiation can occur in the content, process and/or products of classroom instruction. Differentiating Content Content consists of the knowledge, skills and attitudes that students learn, as reflected in the general outcomes of the program of studies. These outcomes identify what students are expected to achieve in the course of their language learning; however, individual students may vary in their language competence, their ability to apply the language in various situations and their use of effective strategies. There are three basic ways to differentiate content: parallel instruction, overlapping instruction and additional or remedial instruction. 1. Parallel Instruction In parallel instruction, all students work toward the same general outcomes, but some students work on specific outcomes from different grade levels. This instruction often requires flex ible grouping within the classroom. For example, all students in a class could be engaged in using Spanish to get things done (Applications); however, while most st udents are making and responding to suggestions (Grade 7), some students c ould work on giving and responding to advice and warnings (Grade 8), while ot her students could make/give and respond to directions, instructions or request s in formal situations (Grade 9). 2. Overlapping Instruction In overlapping instruction, some or all of a student's outcomes for the instructional activity are drawn from sources other than the standard subject-area program of studies and are based on goals identified in that student's IPP. For example, a student with a moderate or severe cognitiv e disability may work on his or her goal For more information ... Appendix C Examples of General Accommodations, Examples of Instructional Accommodations Spanish Language and Culture 9Y Guide to Implementation (7-9) Chapter 4 / 99 Alberta Education, Alberta, Canada 2010 of using pictorial symbols to express basic requests within the classroom, while the other students use Spanish vocabulary to do the same task. 3. Additional Instruction Additional instruction occurs when a student has unique learning needs that necessitate instruction in an area not required by other students, sometimes with direction from a specialist. For example, a student with learning disabilities may need additional instruction regarding p honemic awareness, decoding or effective use of learning strategies. Differentiating Process Differentiating the process means varying learning activities or instructional strategies to provide appropriate opportu nities for all students to explore new concepts. This may require developing a num ber of different ways that students can participate or providing adapted equipmen t or materials. Collaborative learning activities, learning centres, learning logs, individual goal setting, changing the pace and/or delivery of instruction, and using visual and verbal cueing are examples of differentiating process so that all students can be more active participants in the classroom. Differentiating Products Differentiating products means varying the ty pe and complexity of the products that students create to demonstrate their learni ng. Students working below grade level may have different or reduced performan ce expectations from their grade-level peers. For example, they may answer a question with a drawing instead of a written sentence. Allowing students choices for demonstrating their knowledge can also accommodate differing student abilities, interests and learning preferences. Program Planning for Differentiation Teachers can use a framework, such as the one described in the following steps, to plan for differentiation in the language and culture classroom. 1. Identify underlying concepts. Identify the concepts all students in the class should understand by the end of the lesson or unit. It is important to separ ate the concepts from the content used to develop these concepts. Different cont ent may be necessary for students with different levels of skill; however, at th e end of the learning activity all students should have a similar understanding of the concepts, taking into consideration the level at which they are working. For more information ... Appendix C Instructional Planning Guide For more information ... Appendix C Sample Text Forms 100 / Chapter 4 Spanish Language and Culture 9Y Guide to Implementation (7-9) 2010 Alberta Education, Alberta, Canada 2. Choose instructional strategies. Present the concepts in such a way that all students are able to gain an appropriate degree of knowledge. Consider the following strategies for differentiating instruction: Present new material in short periods of time through varied activities. Use materials at a variety of difficulty levels for the whole group. Begin instruction at the individual st udent's current level of functioning. Stand close to students who need extra help. Modify the pace of instruction. Simplify instructions . Write instructions on the board. Ask students to repeat instructions or paraphrase what has been presented. Demonstrate, model or act out instructions. Complete the first example with students. Use a multisensory approach. Present concepts in as concrete a way as possible. Use pictures and concrete materials. Use different-coloured chalk and pens. Break information into steps. Provide additional time to preview materials and/or complete tasks. Adapt the level of questioning. Use your advance planning organizers. 3. Choose strategies for student practice. Use a variety of practice activities and, whenever possible, provide students with choices for their mode of practice. This may require adapting how students participate, providing adapted materials or adapting goals for individual students. Each student should have the opportunity to participate meaningfully according to his or her skill level. The following chart shows examples of different modes of student practice. Verbalize Write Create Perform Solve oral report panel discussion debate games brainstorming oral questions and answers interviews research papers poems essays stories diaries plays cookbooks diorama collage painting model pictograph mural bulletin board games inventions simulation role-play drama pantomime puppet show radio commercials puzzles problems riddles games brain teasers charades Spanish Language and Culture 9Y Guide to Implementation (7-9) Chapter 4 / 101 Alberta Education, Alberta, Canada 2010 4. Choose strategies for assessment and evaluation. Identify a variety of ways that students can demonstrate their mastery of the objectives and their understanding of the concepts. The criteria for evaluation should take into account the students' needs and abilities. Using Collaborative Learning Collaborative learning is a natural approach to differentiating instruction that can benefit both students with special education needs and their classmates. It can help to build positive peer relationships, incre ase students' feelings of responsibility for classmates and encourage strategic learning by capitalizing on students' natural desires to interact. This approach gives students opportunities to learn new information in a supportive environment and to benefit from the experience and thinking of others . Often, students accomplish together what they could not have accomplished alone. Collaborative tasks provide opportunities for language and culture learning specifically because students: participate actively in authentic situations externalize their knowledge, allowing them to reflect on, revise and apply it notice gaps in their linguistic knowledge as they try to express themselves learn from the behaviour, strategies and knowledge of more successful students (Swain 2001). Teachers might consider using the following strategies to make collaborative learning as beneficial as possible. Reflection Create structured, reflective group activiti es in which students examine their own thought processes and explain how they reach a conclusion or arrive at an answer. Research suggests that students with learning difficulties are successful in collaborative settings only when this reflective element is incorporated (Scheid 1993). Furthermore, this kind of reflection and sharing during group discussions helps all students build higher-ord er thinking skills that are essential for language learning. Social Skills Teach and practise social skills within group contexts. To be successful, group members must get to know and trust one another, communicate accurately, accept and support each other, and resolve co nflicts constructively (Johnson and Johnson 1994). Accountability Create situations in which each group member is accountable for his or her learning, and group accountability is based on the achievement of group members. Research suggests that this accountability r esults in greater academic improvement for students with special education needs (Stevens and Slavin 1991). Variety Use a variety of different groupings a nd activities. See Chapter 3 \"Cooperative Learning Activities\" for some sample collaborative groupings and activities. For more information ... Chapter 3 Cooperative Learning Activities For more information ... Chapter 7 102 / Chapter 4 Spanish Language and Culture 9Y Guide to Implementation (7-9) 2010 Alberta Education, Alberta, Canada Strategies for Students with Attention Difficulties Attention is the ability to focus on and en code relevant information, to sustain focus and to carry out two or more tasks simultaneously. Attention also affects the regulation of mental energy and alertness. Students experiencing difficulties with attention may: miss instructions respond with answers unrelated to the questions look attentive and focused but have trouble understanding and responding appropriately be easily distracted have difficulty inhibiting responses be impulsive move around or fidget have problems doing two tasks simultaneously; e.g., listening and taking notes. Teachers might consider using the following sample strategies to support students who have attention difficulties. 1. Create structure to focus attention. Provide study carrels, earphones and desks located in a quiet part of the classroom, or provide other physical accommodations to reduce extraneous stimuli. Encourage students to use a bookmark, ruler or sheet of paper to cover the rest of the page when reading or reviewing directions. Limit materials on desks or in work spaces. Keep instructional group sizes as small as possible. Limit the number of oral instructions given at any one time, and follow up with printed instructions that include visual cues. 2. Give cues when students are to shift their attention. Keep tasks short and specific, and give only one instruction at a time. For example, say: \"Read the first paragra ph.\" After it has been read, instruct: \"Now answer question one.\" Provide a list of tasks to be completed and have students check off each task as it is completed. Provide cues when there is a shift in ac tivity. For example, when speaking to the class, stop and indicate information that students should write down. Spanish Language and Culture 9Y Guide to Implementation (7-9) Chapter 4 / 103 Alberta Education, Alberta, Canada 2010 3. Allow time for movement. Provide stretch or movement breaks as needed or make them part of the classroom routine. Arrange an area in the classroom where students can move around without distracting others. Give students the option of going to this area when they need a stretch break. Have students do regular errands in the classroom, such as passing out papers or putting materials away, so they can move in the classroom in appropriate, helpful ways. Arrange nondistracting ways for student s to move while involved in desk work. For example, replace a student's chair with a large ball and have him or her bounce gently at his or her desk while working. Small inflatable cushions also provide students with an opportunity to move in their seats without distracting others. 4. Encourage students to maintain focus and mental energy. Provide periodic verbal prompts or visual cues to remind students to stay on task. For example, set an alarm to go off at specific intervals as a reminder to focus, or use recorded audio messages to remind students to check their work. Create guidelines for good listening skills and review these guidelines frequently; e.g., \"Show me 'listening.' Eyes on speaker. Pencils down. Hands on desk.\" Reinforce listening skills and behaviours for all students by commending students who demonstrate these skills and describing what they are doing as successful listeners. Place visual cues, such as stickers or check marks, at specific spots on worksheets as a signal for students to take a break. Use auditory cues, such as bells or timers, to indicate when to take a break or return to work. Place a time limit on homework. If middle school students are typically spending more than ninety minutes a night on homework, this may be counter-productive and cause stress for the family. Encourage parents to contact the school if they have homework concerns. 5. Use low-key cues to correct inappropriate behaviour. Post reminders on students' desks. When possible, have students design and make reminder cards. Simply walk by a nd point to the reminder. This works for such skills as: asking politely for help focusing on work taking turns. Collaborate with individual students to identify physical cues that indicate that a behaviour is interfering with learni ng. Cues should be unobtrusive and simple, such as a hand on the shoulder. This works for minor behaviours, such as interrupting or talking off topic. 104 / Chapter 4 Spanish Language and Culture 9Y Guide to Implementation (7-9) 2010 Alberta Education, Alberta, Canada Use coloured file cards with key mes sages, such as \"talk in a low voice\" or \"keep working.\" If students need remind ers, lay the cards on their desks, without comment. After five minutes, if the behaviour has improved, quietly remove the card. If the behaviour continues, add a second card. 6. Encourage students to attend to instructions. Enforce a \"no pencils in sight\" rule during class instruction and discussion times. Teach students to fold over their worksheet s so only the directions show. This will physically slow down students a nd encourage them to attend to the instructions. Ask students to repeat instructions in their own words to a partner or the teacher. Ask students to work through a few ques tions and then check their work. For example, say: \"Do the first five and then raise your hand and we'll check them together to make sure you are on the right track.\" Hand out worksheets one at a time, when possible. Make a graph and have students record the number of correct answers (versus the number of completed answers). Th is will benefit students who might be more focused on quantity than quality. Strategies for Students with Memory Difficulties Memory is the ability to record new info rmation, retain information for a short time, consolidate and use new knowledge a nd skills, and store information for the long term. Memory also involves retrieval and the efficient recall of stored ideas. Students experiencing difficulties with memory may: be unable to remember colours and shapes despite repeated instruction be unable to recall information despite extensive studying frequently lose their belongings have problems remembering daily routines despite regular exposure have problems recalling facts and pro cedures, such as new vocabulary words or verb conjugations. Teachers might consider using the following sample strategies to support students who have memory difficulties. 1. Use instructional techniques that support and enhance memory skills. Provide one instruction at a time until students can remember and follow two consecutive instructions. Provide two in structions at a time until students can remember and follow three. Provide opportunities for students to see di rections and other information. For example, take time each day to write and discuss the daily schedule on the board. Spanish Language and Culture 9Y Guide to Implementation (7-9) Chapter 4 / 105 Alberta Education, Alberta, Canada 2010 Write down the main points on an overhead or on the board when giving verbal instructions. Present concepts concretely. Real-lif e examples add meaning and relevance that aid learning and recall. Concepts are easier to learn and retain when presented in familiar or authentic contexts. Assess student learning frequently and on shorter units of work. Use quick, short evaluations rather than formal, longer tests. Use language that is familiar. Provide cues that will help students recall details. 2. Integrate memory aids into each learning activity. Provide regularly scheduled reviews of procedures and concepts. For example, start each day by reviewing prev iously learned skills and ideas. Then present new skills and ideas. Before students leave for home, review the new information. Teach students to make lists of reminde rs regularly and to note dates for assignments on a calendar. Teach mnemonics to help students recall c oncepts or facts. For example, use an acronym to describe how verbs are conjugated. 3. Provide multisensory cues to make information and skills easier to remember. Teach sound-symbol associations when introducing new vocabulary words. Say the name of the letter, its sound and a word that starts with that letter while looking at a picture of the word. Trace th e letter on the desk, in the air or in a sand tray. Use visual cues, such as colour codi ng, photograph and drawing sequences, charts and videos. Use auditory and kinesthetic cues in combination. Combine songs with movement and dance patterns. Music and physical routines linked to fact learning can help students memorize faster and act as a cue for retrieving specific information. Incorporate hands-on learning experiences and demonstrations. Students learn and remember more effectively when they have opportunities to see and try out new information and skills in a variety of settings and contexts. 4. Set up classroom organizational systems and routines for easier access of information and materials. Label class supplies and class work. En courage students to use folders and binders with different colours, labels a nd pictures to separate subject work or materials for each class. Ensure that students have their names prominently displayed on all personal supplies. Assist students with daily and weekly organization of their desks and work spaces by providing time to clean desks and organize homework at school. Build procedures into the day for reco rding information in day-timers or assignment books. 106 / Chapter 4 Spanish Language and Culture 9Y Guide to Implementation (7-9) 2010 Alberta Education, Alberta, Canada Provide memory aids for frequently used information; e.g., key vocabulary words can be kept in a pocket on the si des of the students' desks. Schedules can be posted on the board or on the wall, and students can keep personal copies in their desks or in their notebooks. Tape simple cue cards of daily class routines on the students' desks. 5. Teach students strategies for memorizing specific pieces of information. To learn and practise specific vocabulary or verb conjugations, students can use a fold-over strategy. 1. Have students fold a sheet of paper to make four columns. 2. They copy target vocabulary words in English in the first column. 3. They write the Spanish words for each of the vocabulary words in the second column. 4. Students check their answers, correct mistakes and fill in missing words. 5. They fold back the firs t column so the English words are not visible and practise translating the other way. L ooking at each of the Spanish words they wrote in the second column, they write the English translation in the third column. Students check their answers ag ainst the original words in the first column. 6. Students repeat this process to translat e the words back in to Spanish in the fourth column. A completed practice page might look like this: Strategies for Students with Listening Difficulties Listening plays a crucial role in language acquisition. Listening for specific information helps language and culture lear ners internalize the rules of language. Learners also need frequent opportunities to use language by taking on the role of both listener and speaker. Through social interaction, students can make and clarify or confirm meaning, test hypotheses about the language, and receive feedback. Language and culture learning is best supported when regular classroom practice provides opportunities for interactive listening\u2014listening that requires the student to take a more active role by re questing clarification or providing feedback. mother la madre mother la madre father el padre father el padre brother el ni\u00f1o brother el hermano el hermano Spanish Language and Culture 9Y Guide to Implementation (7-9) Chapter 4 / 107 Alberta Education, Alberta, Canada 2010 Given the importance of listening in lan guage and culture learning, all students will benefit from the development of effective listening strategies, but these strategies are particularly important for students who already have specific difficulties related to listening. Teachers might consider using the following sample strategies to support students who have listening difficulties. 1. Provide students with appropriate expr essions to clarify meaning and to confirm comprehension, such as: \u00bfPuedes repetirlo, por favor? (Could you repeat you say again, please?) \u00bfQu\u00e9 quiere decir? (What do you mean?) in a \"liste ner-friendly\" way; for example: reduce distractions for students clearly communicate expectations provide students with some form of organizer at the beginning of class consistently review and encourage the recall of previously presented information use cue words and phrases to signal important information use transitional phrases to cue and signal the organization of information highlight important information vary volume, tone of voice and rate of speech to emphasize important ideas and concepts present information in many different ways repeat important ideas and concepts by rephrasing and using multiple examples write important ideas, key concep ts and vocabulary on the board use visual aids and objects to support the concepts and information that are presented provide examples and non-examples of concepts frequently check for understanding provide students with opportunities to discuss concepts with a partner or in a small group provide students with opportunities to work with and practise new skills and concepts create time for reflection at the end of the class briefly review the important concepts at the end of the class, and preview what will be happening the next class.

Appendix C How \"Listener- friendly\" Is My Instruction ? 108 / Chapter 4 Spanish Language and Culture 9Y Guide to Implementation (7-9) 2010 Alberta Education, Alberta, Canada 3. Model and practise active listening strategies in class. Active listening is the act of intentiona lly focusing on the speaker to engage oneself in the discussion or presentation. Encourage and cue students to show active listening by: 1. looking at the speaker 2. keeping quiet 3. keeping their hands and feet to themselves 4. keeping their bodies still 5. thinking about what the speaker is saying. Strategies for Students with Reading Difficulties Research suggests that a student's first language is always present in his or her mind during second language learning; the second language knowledge that is created is connected in all sorts of ways with the first language knowledge. Mental reprocessing of second language words, phrases or sentences into first language forms is a common cognitive strategy for language learners (Kern 1994). First language understanding is also used in more complex ways to think about and process what is being read in the second language. This means that students who have difficulty reading in their first language may have difficulty reading in a second language. Many students with special education needs may be reading below grade-level expectations and w ill need accommodations in this area. Recent research related to language and cu lture reading has focused on the use of reading strategies. In one study, st udents who experienced difficulty with language learning were found to rely more extensively on phonetic decoding, while more successful students used stra tegies that called on general background knowledge; e.g., inferences, predictions a nd elaborations (Chamot and El-Dinary 1999). This research suggests that teachers can help students become more effective second language learners by help ing them be more flexible with their first-language reading strategies and more effective at monitoring and adapting their strategies. Teachers might consider using the following sample strategies to support students who have reading difficulties. 1. Create extra support for students with reading difficulties. Pair readers who are less able with competent readers and have the pairs read and complete assignments together. Provide students with picture dictionaries to help them find and remember vocabulary. Photocopy reading material for students and use opaque tape to cover new or difficult words. Write simpler or previously learned vocabulary on the tape. This is also effective for reading materials that contain many idioms, metaphors or unfamiliar figures of speech. For more information ... Alberta Learning. Unlocking Potential: Key Components of Programming for Students with Learning Disabilities. Edmonton, AB: Alberta Learning, 2002. Spanish Language and Culture 9Y Guide to Implementation (7-9) Chapter 4 / 109 Alberta Education, Alberta, Canada 2010 2. Teach students specific reading strategies. Have students use text-content strategies, such as making connections to previous knowledge or experiences, making predictions about what will happen in a text and asking questions about the text. Have students use these strategies before, during and after readi ng to identify, reflect on, understand and remember material they are reading. Have students use decoding strategies, such as highlighting different parts of a sentence in different colours (e.g., nouns in green, verbs in yellow), to break down and decode sentences. Have students use cognitive and metacognitive strategies to monitor comprehension, such as pausing after each sentence or paragraph and asking \"Does this make sense to me?\" Have students use strategies for dealing with unfamiliar vocabulary, such as the \"Read Around\" strategy: 1. Skip the word and read to the end of the sentence. 2. Go back and read the whole sentence again. 3. Think: \"What word would fit here?\" 4. Try out a word in the sentence. Does this word sound right? Does this word make sense? 5. Look at the picture for a clue, if there is one. 6. Ask someone. 110 / Spanish Language and Culture 9Y Guide to Implementation (7-9) 2010 Alberta Education, Alberta, Canada Spanish Language and Culture 9Y Guide to Implementation (7-9) Chapter 5 / 111 Alberta Education, Alberta, Canada 2010 Chapter Summary Characteristics of Students Who Are Gifted Implications for Learning and Teaching Advanced Thinking Processes Mentorships Providing Additional Opportunities Characteristics of Students Who Are Gifted Each child who is gifted has an individual profile of abilities, needs, interests and learning preferences; however, there are a number of general characteristics associated with giftedness that become a pparent early in life. Some of these characteristics appear in students at all ability levels, but they are more prevalent in students who are gifted. For instance, many students demonstrate heightened sensitivity and perfectionism, but in stud ents who are gifted these tendencies are more predominant and appear at more extreme levels. Students who are gifted can often be a challenge for teachers, but these students have significant potential for achieving excellence. Chapter 5 Students Who Are Gifted 112 / Chapter 5 Spanish Language and Culture 9Y Guide to Implementation (7-9) 2010 Alberta Education, Alberta, Canada Common Intellectual Characteristics of Students Who Are Gifted Trait or Aptitude Behavioural Examples Advanced Intellectual Achievement Takes great pleasure in intellectual activity. Has high aspirations. Easily grasps new ideas and concepts and understands them more deeply than same-aged peers. Easily memorizes facts, lists, dates and names.

Creativity Comes up with new ideas and concepts on his or her own, and applies them in creative and interesting ways. Uses materials in new and unusual ways. Has lots of ideas to share. Creates complicated plays and games, or adds new details and twists to stories, songs, movies and games. Responds to questions with a list of possible answers. Escapes into fantasy and appears to have trouble separating what is real from what is not. Goes off in his or her own direction rather than following instructions. Spends a lot of time daydreaming or thinking, which may be perceived as wasting time. Makes up elaborate excuses or finds loopholes to evade responsibility for his or her own behaviours. 114 / Chapter 5 Spanish Language and Culture 9Y Guide to Implementation (7-9) 2010 Alberta Education, Alberta, Canada Common Affective Characteristics of Students Who Are Gifted Trait or Aptitude Behavioural Examples Heightened Sensitivity Experiences emotions strongly and may be emotionally reactive. Reacts strongly and personally to injustice, criticism, rejection or pain. Demonstrates, at an early age, an understanding and awareness of other people's feelings, thoughts and experiences, and can be upset by other people's strong emotions. Is easily excited or moved to tears. Appreciates aesthetics and is able to interpret complex works of art. Shares feelings and ideas through one or more of the arts. Is extremely observant and able to read nonverbal cues. Exhibits heightened sensory awareness (for example, is over-selective about food and clothing choices). May become unusually fearful, anxious, sad and even depressed. Responds emotionally to photographs, art and music. Heightened Intensity Is energetic and enthusiastic. Becomes intensely absorbed in various pursuits, sometimes ignoring school responsibilities as a result. Has strong attachments and commitments. Goes further than most students would to pursue an interest, solve a problem, find the answer to a question or reach a goal. Collects things. Is extremely persistent and focused when motivated, but has a limited attention span for things that are not of interest. Appears restless in mind and body. Gets easily frustrated and may act out. Perfectionism Sets high (often unrealistic) expectations for himself or herself and others. Is persistent, perseverant and enthusiastically devoted to work. Gives up if his or her own standards are not met or if a mistake is made. Is self-evaluative and self-judging. Experiences feelings of inadequacy and inferiority, and desires frequent praise and reassurance. Becomes extremely defensive of criticism. Introversion Has deep feelings and a complex inner life. Is reflective and introspective. Focuses on inner growth through searching, questioning and exercising self-corrective judgement. Is knowledgeable about his or her own emotions. Withdraws into himself or herself rather than acting aggressively toward others. Spanish Language and Culture 9Y Guide to Implementation (7-9) Chapter 5 / 115 Alberta Education, Alberta, Canada 2010 Trait or Aptitude Behavioural Examples Moral Sensitivity and Integrity Is concerned about ethical issues at an early age. Has strong moral convictions. Is capable of advanced moral reasoning and judgement. Places a strong emphasis on consistency between values and actions in himself or herself and others. Is extremely aware of the world. Is altruistic and idealistic (desires to enhance caring and civility in the community and in society at large). Assumes responsibility for others and himself or herself. Sense of Humour Makes up riddles and jokes with double meanings. Makes up puns and enjoys all kinds of wordplay. Plays the class clown. Can be disruptive or get frustrated when others don't \"get it.\" Does not understand or seem to appreciate the humour of other students. Asynchronous Development Asynchronous development can also be a ch aracteristic of giftedness. Asynchrony means that the rates of intellectual, emotional and physical development are uneven. This means that students who are gifted may be significantly out of developmental step with their same-age peers. Students with asynchronous development: may be more complex and intense than same-age peers may feel incompatible with other stude nts their age and with learning and recreational activities designed for their age group appear to be different ages in diffe rent situations, which could result in difficulties adjusting emotionally and socially. These tendencies increase with the child's degree of giftedness. Students who experience asynchronous development need a sensitive and flexible approach from teachers in order to develop to their full potential. The greatest need of these students is an environment where it is safe to be different. Implications for Learning and Teaching For some children who are gifted, a comb ination of the characteristics mentioned above may lead to difficulties in relations with peers and authority figures, avoidance of risk-taking or excessive self-criticism. To address these concerns, consider how students' individual characteristics are linked to specific learning needs. The following chart illustrates sample characteristics and the learning needs that may be associated with them. For more information ... Alberta Learning.

A student's IPP will contain essential inform ation about the student's strengths and needs, current level of performance, sp ecialized assessment results, recommended supports and instructional strategies that w ill be most effective for the student. The student's learning team will also de velop a number of long-term goals and measurable objectives (usually one to three per year for a student who is gifted). The second language teacher is an important member of the learning team. Participating in planning meetings and b ecoming familiar with information in the IPP will allow teachers to actively support a student's long-term goals and success across subject areas. Flexible Pacing Flexible pacing allows students to move through the curriculum at their own rate; it lowers repetition and potential boredom by reducing the amount of time students must spend on outcomes they have already mastered. Completing outcomes in a reduced time frame provides more time for students to participate in more challenging activities in the language and culture class. Characteristic/Learning Need Chart: This chart adapted from the Department of Edu cation, State of Victoria, Bright Futures Resource Book: Education of Gifted Students (Melbourne, Australia: Department of Educ ation, State of Victoria, 1996), p. 30. Copyright owned by the State of Victoria (Department of E ducation and Early Childhood Developm ent). Used with permission. Spanish Language and Culture 9Y Guide to Implementation (7-9) Chapter 5 / 117 Alberta Education, Alberta, Canada 2010 How to successfully impl ement flexible pacing: 1. Identify learning objectives for the whole class according to the program of studies. 2. Pretest the entire class to identify students wh o would benefit from an opportunity to work at a faster, more independent pace. 3. Plan appropriate alternative activities. 4. Eliminate unnecessary practice and review activities for those students who have mastered the material. 5. Keep accurate records of activities and assessments to ensure that individual students have the opportunity to explore all learning outcomes. Another form of flexible pacing is conten t acceleration. In this approach, students who have mastered the learning outcomes for their grade level may be moved to a higher grade to take instruction at a mo re challenging level. For example, a student who has mastered the concepts and skills in the Grade 7 program of studies could move to the Grade 8 or Grade 9 class for Spanish. Enrichment Strategies The following section outlines sample enri chment strategies that teachers can use to differentiate the planning and deliver y of language and culture instruction. Grade/Curriculum Focus Whole Group Activity Suggestion for Differentiation Grade 7 providing information on several aspects of a topic Using a vocabulary list, students work in groups of two or three to write a short script about friends travelling to a popular Spanish-speaking travel destination. They share a reading of their script with the class. Students interview community members who speak Spanish, and are familiar with a Spanish-speaking travel destination, write about what they learned from the interview, and then present what they have learned to the class. Grade 8 developing reading skills in Spanish Using a vocabulary list, students work in groups of two or three to write a short script about meeting a new friend. They share a reading of their script with the class. Students read a story written above grade level and develop graphic organizers or answer questions on the story to illustrate comprehension. Grade 9 exploring the use of language for fun and to interpret humour Students listen to or read a variety of traditional songs, folk tales or stories in Spanish. Based on their research and understanding of the language and culture, students develop a new song, folk tale or story and teach it to the class in Spanish.

These activities can take many forms and should challenge the students' thinking abilities and push students to engage more deeply in the content area. Alternative learning activities provide different types of learning tasks that may be more challenging and appropriate for st udents who are gifted. For example, students may be provided with different ways to present a project; e.g., PowerPoint, Web pages, videos, posters or brochures, puppet shows, and live skits. Beyond this, some topics can be developed into a series of challenging learning activities organized in an alternative lear ning activities menu. Students can choose a number of activities from the menu to comp lete independently or with a partner during class instructional time. See the following sample menu. For a blank template ... Appendix C Alternative Learning Activities Menu Spanish Language and Culture 9Y Guide to Implementation (7-9) Chapter 5 / 119 Alberta Education, Alberta, Canada 2010 Alternative Learning Activities Menu Complete three activities to create a horizontal, vertical or diagonal line.

PLAN Plan a menu for a class party. Write a grocery list in Spanish for your party supplies. INTERVIEW In Spanish, interview other students about their snacking habits. How do they try to make healthy choices ? RESEARCH Research traditional foods enjoyed in a Spanish-speaking country during major holidays. YOUR IDEA SURVEY In Spanish, develop a survey about students' favourite lunch foods. Ask your classmates to complete the survey. DISPLAY Design a display board that illustrates favourite foods of the class and that includes the Spanish words and phrases for each food. CREATE Create a replica of a small coffee shop in the corner of the classroom, complete with menus and signs in Spanish. Use this set for role-playing\u2014ordering in a restaurant, meeting new people or having a conversation in Spanish. EVALUATE In Spanish, create a rubric to evaluate your performance on one of the other activities from this menu. 120 / Chapter 5 Spanish Language and Culture 9Y Guide to Implementation (7-9) 2010 Alberta Education, Alberta, Canada Independent Study Many students who are gifted enjoy and benefit from opportunities to individually investigate course topics. Components of an independent study program include: identifying and developing a focus developing skills in crea tive and critical thinking using problem-solving and decision-making strategies learning research skills developing project-management strategies keeping learning logs reflecting on and evaluating the process and product sharing the product with an intended audience beyond the classroom keeping a portfolio of results. Independent studies help students move learning from being teacher-directed to being student-directed. With teacher support and coachi ng, students learn how to decide on a focus, develop a plan of action, follow the plan through and monitor their progress. Students take part in developing criteria for evaluation an d work collaboratively with the teacher. Possibilities for independent study include: writing and recording a script creating a magazine or picture book on a topic of interest developing a slide show presentation on a t opic of interest and presenting it to other students creating a display about a story read or country researched developing a puppet show on a related topic writing a new ending to a story or movie creating a story to share with others. Students need to be well prepared to work independently, and they need to be clear on the product, processes and behavioural expectations. Students who are gifted will need instru ction and ongoing support to manage and benefit from independently completing a lternative learning activities. Some students may benefit from an independent study agreement that outlines learning and working conditions and lays out basic expectations. For more information ... Appendix C Sample Independent Study Agreement Spanish Language and Culture 9Y Guide to Implementation (7-9) Chapter 5 / 121 Alberta Education, Alberta, Canada 2010 Advanced Thinking Processes Bloom's Taxonomy (Bloom 1956) is a model frequently used as a guide when designing themes, units, learning activiti es and assignments that promote higher levels of thinking. The taxonomy can be used when contemplating learning opportunities for students who are gifted. Bloom proposes that at the most basic level people remember and understand. At higher levels people learn how to apply principles and to analyze, evaluate and cr eate. Assuming that students have no background in a topic of investigation, they would move from remembering and understanding to applying before working w ith the higher-order skills of analyzing, evaluating and creating. The latter three leve ls are associated with critical thinking.

In a successful mentorship, the mentor and student will have complementary teaching and learning preferences and will engage in a mutual exchange of knowledge. Mentorship is an ideal vehicle for facilitating the differentiated learning needs of students who are gifted. For language a nd culture programs, mentorships provide opportunities for students to engage with na tive language speakers for a variety of purposes, such as interviews, individual pr ojects, conversation practice, connection to the local cultural community and exploring career options. Through mentorships, students can also share the language learning process with an adult learner who can encourage metacognitive development by exploring and discussing language learning strategies. Guidelines for mentorships: 1. Identify what (not whom) the students need. 2. Discuss with the students whether they would like to work with a mentor and, if so, what they would like to gain from the relationship. 3. Identify appropriate mentor candidates. Explore contacts from the local community. Conduct the appropriate reference checks as directed by school jurisdiction policy. 4. Interview and screen the mentors. Be expl icit about the students ' goals and learning strategies and about potential benefits for bo th the students and the mentors. Provide training as required. 5. Match mentors with students. 6. Prepare students for the mentorship. Ensure that they understand its purpose, benefits, limitations and commitments. Write down the participants' roles and responsibilities. 7. Monitor the mentor relationship to ensure that it is achieving its goals. Renegotiate the relationship as needed, and seek new mentors if students are not benefiting. For more information ...

Edmonton, AB: Alberta Learning, 2000, pp. 179-183. 124 / Chapter 5 Spanish Language and Culture 9Y Guide to Implementation (7-9) 2010 Alberta Education, Alberta, Canada Providing Additional Opportunities Language learning can be enriched by giving students opportunities to use language for authentic purposes. This can include conversations with native speakers and others who speak the langu age fluently, such as parents, older students, community members, members of cultural associations and other classroom visitors. Students will benefit from listening and speaking with these resource people and from working on enrichment activities and projects with them. Another option is to link the class with a peer class in another country so that students can have ongoing writing exchang es and can engage in joint learning projects. For students who learn quickly, using Spanish to engage in communication for real purposes can lead to significant enrichment and satisfaction. In addition, students who are gifted will often benefit from access to a wide variety of print and media resources. These st udents can often handle more challenging reading levels and may be eager to l earn about more complex or specialized subject areas. Libraries, the Internet and cultural organizations are all good sources for supplemental resources. For more information ...

Englis h language learners may have recently immigrated to Canada or they may have been born in Canada and been living in homes in which the primary spoken language is not English. Linguistic and cultural diversity is ch aracteristic of schools and communities throughout the province. Children and their families immigrate to Alberta from every corner of the world. Canadian students of Aboriginal, Francophone and other cultural descents, whose families have lived in Alberta for many generations, may be learning to speak English as a second language. Chapter 6 English Language Learners 126 / Chapter 6 Spanish Language and Culture 9Y Guide to Implementation (7-9) 2010 Alberta Education, Alberta, Canada Canadian-born English Language Learners First Nations, M\u00e9tis and Inuit (FNMI) peoples may speak English, French, an FNMI language or a combination of languages in their homes and communities can differ greatly from community to community have skill in their first language, which influences further language learning that ranges from fluent to minimal may use culturally specific nonverbal communication and may have specific cultural values and belief s regarding listening and speaking Francophone people come from within the province an d from other areas of Canada may enter English-speaking schools at any age or may be learning English as a second language in a Francophone school Hutterites, Mennonites or members of other religious groups attend school within their communities and learn English to meet the outcomes of the program of studies have religious and cultural concerns in their communities that strongly influence the selection of instructional strategies and teaching materials Canadian-born children of immigrants have parents who may not speak English, limiting family support in schooling in some cases, are born in Canada and return to their parents' home country, only to return for schooling in Alberta at some later time Foreign-born English Language Learners Recently arrived immigrants make up a lar ge group of En glish lan guage learners in Alberta schools may arrive at any time in the school year, and could be at any grade level usually have attended school on a regular basis in their home country, and may have already studied English at school there, although this typically involves only a basic introduction to the language Refugees have all the needs of re gular immi grants, as well as issues relatin g to war, disaster, trauma and disorientation may not have wanted to leave their home countries may be worried about family members who have been left behind may have received little or no formal schooling and may have complex needs that go beyond learning English as a second language may qualify for additional assistance from the federal government on arrival may require assistance from go vernment and from social and community agencies for several years Challenges for English Language Learners Students may struggle with expressing their knowledge, gathering information and pursuing new concepts in an unfamiliar language. Students are in an environment where they are expected to acquire more sophisticated and complex knowledge and understanding of the world around them. Students often learn the full Alberta curriculum while learning English. Many students will experience value and cult ural conflicts between their home language and culture and the English language an d culture in which they are immersed. Spanish Language and Culture 9Y Guide to Implementation (7-9) Chapter 6 / 127 Alberta Education, Alberta, Canada 2010 Cultural Considerations The cultural and life experiences of each English language learner will differ from those of other English language learners and those of their classmates. In preparing to welcome new students to the school, staff and teachers should find out as much as possible about the students' linguistic a nd cultural backgrounds. Many countries have a complex linguistic environment. For example, students from India may use two or three languages regularly. In some cases, language is the basis for po litical strife between groups of people. For example, using the language of government or industry gives people exclusive access to power in some multilingual countri es. In such cases, language can be a highly emotional issue. Teachers should not assume that because tw o students come from the same general geographical area they have language and cu lture in common. They may have very different backgrounds, experiences and beliefs. Sensitivity to political issues is also impor tant. People who ha ve been on opposing sides of political disputes in the past may now be living side by side in Canada. Usually, they leave their political diffe rences behind them, but in some cases long-standing conflicts between groups of people can affect the way they regard and interact with one another. Teachers should avoid stereotypical th inking about a student's background, abilities and preferences. Every country , culture and language group also has diversity within it. It is important to learn from students and their families about their previous experiences, goals, expecta tions and abilities. This inquiry and listening should be done with an open mind. The Role of Culture in Second Language Learning Learning a second language often involves getting to know a new culture. By the time a child is 5 years old, the first culture is already deeply rooted in his or her value and belief systems. The first cultu re of English language learners influences their way of communicating in the second language. For example, many Asian and FNMI students may avoid direct eye contact when speaking with teachers out of respect, based on the teachings of their cultures. Gestures and body movements convey different meanings in different cultures. Also, the physical distance between speaker and listener is an important factor in some cultures. Some students may stand ve ry close when they speak to a teacher, whereas others may back off if they th ink the teacher is too close. As the significance of even a friendly or encourag ing touch is open to different cultural interpretations, such action should be used cautiously, if not avoided altogether. Learning how to interpret body language , facial expressions, tone of voice and volume in a new language and culture tak es time on the part of the learner and patience and understanding on the part of th e teacher. It may take a while before students learn the cultural cues that help them communicate more effectively and appropriately in nonverbal ways. 128 / Chapter 6 Spanish Language and Culture 9Y Guide to Implementation (7-9) 2010 Alberta Education, Alberta, Canada Some English language learners may only feel comfortable with male or with female teachers, depending on their cust oms and experiences. English language learners may or may not have previously studied in a classroom or school with both male and female students. Prior knowledge of this and discussion with parents or guardians and with students will help English language learners feel more comfortable in the school setting. Impact of Learning Preferences Like all students, English language learne rs have differing personalities, cognitive abilities and educational and life experi ences that influence their abilities and approaches to learning. Some students take a systematic or analytical approach to second language learning. They want to know more about how the language works, such as rules governing grammar and spelling. These st udents may need longer conversational silences, as they wait to make sure that when they speak they will use language that is grammatically correct. These students te nd to be shy or rigi dly independent and have difficulty risking mistakes or accepting or asking for assistance. Other students are holistic in their orientation, focusing more on getting their message across than on its delivery. The se students tend to be outgoing risk-takers who try to communicate from the start. They are typically comfortable with making mistakes, being corrected and asking for assistance; however, they may be satisfied with lower literacy levels and n eed to be motivated to work hard at developing greater accuracy in their language use. Other Learning Impacts Class discussion and participation may be fo reign concepts to students of other cultures; for them, volunteering answers and information may be a bold and immodest practice. English language lear ners may be shocked by the spontaneous and outspoken behaviours of their peers. They have to adjust to new teaching styles and turn-taking rules in the classroom. Students who have come from schools with populations far greater than those found in Alberta may have learned to disappear in a large group but now feel as if their every move stands out. It may take these students some time to become comfortable in this new learning environment. English language learners may have to ma ke a transition from rote memorization of facts to analytical problem solving or from total dependence to self-reliance. Discovery, trial and error, and a question-an swer style of learning can be strange to students who have been taught to believe that the teacher is the sole source of information and that the learner must accept information and not question it or volunteer opinions. Experience-based instru ction with field trips may not be taken seriously by students and parents or gua rdians who have different views of learning. Many parents or guardians of E nglish language learners also expect their children to do a great deal of homework. Communication between the home and school is essential to ensure that there is mutual understanding of expectations. Spanish Language and Culture 9Y Guide to Implementation (7-9) Chapter 6 / 129 Alberta Education, Alberta, Canada 2010 Understanding Cultural Differences in Student Behaviour Teachers working with English language lear ners should also be aware that these students may sometimes respond in unexpected ways to particular classroom situations or events, because of different experiences, cultural values and beliefs from those of other students. The following char t identifies possible cultural explanations for behaviours and attitudes that Eng lish language learners may exhibit. Behaviour or Attitude Possible Cultural Explanation The student avoids eye contact. Keeping eyes downcast may be a way of showing respect. In some cultures, direct eye contact with a teacher is considered disrespectful and a challenge to the teacher's authority. The student tends to smile when disagreeing with what is being said or when being reprimanded. A smile may be a gesture of respect that children are taught in order to avoid being offensive in difficult situations. The student shrinks from, or responds poorly to, apparently inoffensive forms of physical contact or proximity. There may be taboos on certain types of physical contact. Buddhists, for instance, regard the head and shoulders as sacred and would consider it impolite to ruffle a child's hair or give a reassuring pat on the shoulder. There are also significant differences among cultures with respect to people's sense of what is considered an appropriate amount of personal space. The student refuses to eat with peers. Some st udents may be unaccustomed to eating with anyone but members of their own family. The student does not participate actively in group work or collaborate readily with peers on cooperative assignments. In some cultures, cooperative group work is never used by teachers. Students may thus view sharing as \"giving away knowledge\" and may see no distinction between legitimate collaboration and cheating. The student displays uneasiness, expresses disapproval or even misbehaves in informal learning situations or situations involving open-ended learning processes; e.g., exploration. Schooling in some cultures involves a strict formality. For students who are used to this, an informal classroom atmosphere may seem chaotic and undemanding, and teachers with an informal approach may seem unprofessional. Such studen ts may also be uncomfortable with process-oriented learning activities and prefer activities that yield more tangible and evident results. Understanding Cultural Differences in Student Behaviour: Adap ted, with permission from the Province of British Columbia, from English as a Second Language Learners: A Guide for Classroom Teachers , pp. 8, 9, 10. \u00a91999 Province of British Columbia. All rights reserved.130 / Chapter 6 Spanish Language and Culture 9Y Guide to Implementation (7-9) 2010 Alberta Education, Alberta, Canada Behaviour or Attitude Possible Cultural Explanation The student refuses to participate in extracurricular activities or in various physical education activities; e.g., swimming, skating, track and field. Extracurricular activities, along with some physical education activities, may not be considered a part of learning or may even be contrary to a student's religion or cultural outlook. Some students may also be working during after-school hours. The student seems inattentive and does not display active learning behaviours. In some cultures, the learning process involves observing and doing, or imitating, rather than listening and absorbing; e.g., through note taking. Performance following instructions reveals that the student is not understanding the instructions, even though she or he exhibited active listening behaviours that suggested understanding and she or he refrained from asking for help or further explanation. In some cultures, expressing a lack of understanding or asking for help from the teacher is considered impolite, being interpreted as a suggestion that the teacher has not been doing a good job. The student is unresponsive, uncooperative or even disrespectful in dealing with teachers of the opposite gender. Separate schooling for boys and girls is the norm in some cultures. Likewise, in some cultures the expectations for males and females are quite different. The idea that females and males should have the same opportunities for schooling and play comparable roles as educators may run contrary to some students' cultural experiences. The student appears reluctant to engage in debate, speculation, argument or other processes that involve directly challenging the views and ideas of others. In some cultures, it is considered inappropriate to openly challenge another's point-of-vie w, especially the teacher's. In some cases, there may be a value attached to being prepared, knowledgeable and correct when opening one's mouth. The student exhibits discomfort or embarrassment at being singled out for special attention or praise. To put oneself in the limelight for individual praise is not considered appropriate in some cultures, in which the group is considered more important than the individual. The student fails to observe the conventions of silent reading. Some students may be cultura lly predisposed to see reading as essentially an oral activity and will read aloud automatically. For others, reading aloud is associated with memorization. The sample situations described in th e preceding chart indicate the need for teachers to be aware of their assumpti ons about the meaning of a student's behaviour and to adjust their own responses accordingly. Often the most effective response of teachers is to be clear and explicit about their own expectations or those prevalent in Canadian society. Spanish Language and Culture 9Y Guide to Implementation (7-9) Chapter 6 / 131 Alberta Education, Alberta, Canada 2010 As English language learners become part of the mainstream class, everyone in the class must be prepared to adapt and broa den their understanding. There are times when the adjustments made to address the needs of English language learners will affect and make demands of the other students in the class. Feedback on Pronunciation An English language learner may be a fluent speaker, but sometimes communication breaks down because the student has problems mastering the English sound system. The amount of difficulty or phonetic interference will depend to a large extent on the pronunc iation patterns of the student's first language. For example, a student who sp eaks a first language that has few final consonants will tend to drop word-final c onsonants in English or other languages, resulting in utterances like the following: Jaw an Baw wa to da sto. (John and Bob walked to the store.) Many English language learners are unnecessarily referred to speech-language pathologists because of problems that are directly attributable to first language interference. It is important for teachers to be aware that it takes students time to actually learn to hear new sounds, pronounce them properly and use them in conversation and in learning to spell. Howe ver, if a student stutters or stammers, or has prolonged problems with pronounci ng certain sounds, it may be necessary to find out if these problems are also evident in the student's first language. To find out whether or not the student requires speech-language intervention, listen to the student speaking in his or her first language with a peer, ask the student's parents or guardians, or request an asse ssment in the student's first language. Basic Interpersonal Communication Skills (BICS) and Cognitive Academic Language Proficiency (CALP) It is important for classroom teachers to understand the differences between functional, everyday language skills and the language skills required in an academic setting. Basic Interpersonal Communication Skills (BICS) typically develop within two years of arrival in an integrated classroom setting. BICS make students appear to have mastered many aspects of the language, as they are able to discuss, joke and socialize with classmates; however, there are considerable differences between BICS and the language required for academic purposes. Cognitive Academic Language Proficiency (CALP) takes five to eight years to acquire, and English language learners need support and assistance with their language learning to achieve CALP. Theref ore, in language and culture programs, it is important to remember that Englis h language learners may or may not have sufficient language or concepts on whic h to base their new language learning. 132 / Chapter 6 Spanish Language and Culture 9Y Guide to Implementation (7-9) 2010 Alberta Education, Alberta, Canada Implications of Learning Multiple Languages Concurrently The number of trilingual students in Canada is increasing, and most people are aware of the advantages of speaking thr ee languages. Possessing skills in multiple languages leads to educational, economic and sociocultural benefits. English language learners, including those who are learning a language in addition to English, as well as those who already ha ve bilingual competencies in languages other than English, develop certain tende ncies as trilingual speakers that may aid their language development. The most im portant of these is facility with language learning skills. Success in acquisition of multiple languages is based on proficiency in the first language, the recency of acquisition of a subsequent language, linguistic distance and interlanguage transfer. Students learning English as a second language may find it beneficial to learn another lang uage as it may improve their understanding of English. Second Language Acquisition The term second language refers to a language that is learned after the first language is relatively well established. By the age of five, children have control over most of their first language grammar. Any language they learn after that is filtered through their previ ously learned language. English language learners are already learning a second language\u2014namely English\u2014in Alberta schools. Whatever their backgrounds, all English language learners will benefit from being included in the Spanish language and culture program. The most compelling reason is that it is typically during the Spanish language and culture program that all st udents in the classroom tend to be on a more level playing field. For example, when a teacher is speaking Spanish, it is possibly the one time during the day when the English language learner understands as much as his or her classmates and is not at a disadvantage, as with instruction in English. In fact, the E nglish language learner' s own first language may provide an advantage. Also, the sk ills necessary to learn a new language are transferable to learning other languages. English language learners should be encouraged to be included in Span ish language and culture programs. Implications of Learning Multiple Language s Concurrently: Adapted from The Language Research Centre of the University of Calgary, A Review of the Literatu re on Second Language Learning (Edmonton, AB: Alberta L earning, 2004), pp. 57, 61.Spanish Language and Culture 9Y Guide to Implementation (7-9) Chapter 6 / 133 Alberta Education, Alberta, Canada 2010 Tips for Teachers of English Language Learners 1. Be conscious of the vocabulary you use. Choose simple, straightforward words that are in everyday use. 2. Provide additional wait time wh en students are responding to questions. 3. Simplify sentence structures and repeat sentences verbatim before trying to rephrase. Short, affirmative sentences are easiest for new learners of English to understand. Complex sentences and passive verb constructions pose a greater challenge. For example, instead of \"The homework must be completed and handed in by Friday,\" it would be better to say \"You must finish the work and give it to me on Friday.\" 4. Recycle new words. Reintroduce new words in a different context, or use recently learned words to introduce or expand a concept. 5. Rephrase idioms or teach their meanings. English language learners often translate idiomatic expressions literally. Post a list of idioms for students to see, talk about and use. 6. Clearly mark transitions during classroom activities. To avoid confusion when changing topics or focu s, explicitly signal the changes; e.g., \"first we will ...\", \"now it's time for ...\". 7. Give clear instructions. Number and label the steps in an activity. Reinforce oral instructions for homework and projects with a written outline to help stud ents who may not be able to process oral instruction quickly enough to understand fully. 8. Use many nonverbal cues. Gestures, facial expressions and mime will help learners grasp the meaning of what you are saying. Be aware, however, that some gestures, e.g., pointing at people, may have negative meanings in some cultures. 9. Periodically check to ensure English language learners understand. English language learners may be reluctant to ask for clarification or to admit that they don't understand something, if asked directly. To ch eck for understanding, focus on the students' body language, watching for active listening be haviours or for expressions or postures that indicate confusion or frustration. 10. Write key words on the board, and use visual and other nonverbal cues, whenever possible, to present key ideas. Concrete objects, charts, maps, pictures, phot ographs, gestures, facial expressions and so on form an important complement to oral ex planations for English language learners. 11. Provide written notes, summaries and instructions. 12. Use the students' native languages to chec k comprehension and to clarify problems. If you or some of your students speak the first language of your English language learner, use the first language to clarify instructions, provide translations of key words that are difficult to explain, and find out what the student knows but cannot express in English. Most English language learners will only need this additional support for a limited time or in rare situations. Tips for Teachers of English Language Learners: Some tips ad apted, with permission from the Province of British Columbia, from English as a Second Language Learners: A Guide for Classroom Teachers , pp. 18, 19, 20. \u00a91999 Province of British Columbia. All rights reserved.134 / Chapter 6 Spanish Language and Culture 9Y Guide to Implementation (7-9) 2010 Alberta Education, Alberta, Canada 13. Communicate interest in students' linguis tic development, and set expectations. 14. Respond to students' language errors. When students produce incorrect grammar or pronunciation, rephrase their responses to model correct usage, without drawing specific attention to the error. In responding to students' written errors, try to focus on consistent errors of a specific type and concentrate on modelling or correcting only that error. If you target each and every error, the student may not grasp the specific rules that must be applied and may become confused and overwhelmed. Keep in mind that it is best to focus on content and understanding first. Considering the Student's Perspective In creating an effective learning environm ent for English language learners, it is important for teachers to consider the learning environment from the student's perspective. English language learners learn best when they: are involved in decision making become aware of available resources are actively involved in evaluation practices have opportunities to develop a sense of self-confidence and competence feel safe and secure to try thin gs and to risk making mistakes are free to interact with materials, peers and adults have opportunities to make choices and decisi ons about what to do, what to use and who to work with become aware of the needs of others and sh ow respect and a caring attitude toward others have opportunities for success influence their own experiences and the experiences of all others in the class continue to develop theories about the way the world works are both a learner and a teacher, an individual and a group member. Celebrating Cultural Differences There are many ways to celebrate cultu ral differences in the classroom and the school. Tips for Celebrating Cultural Differences 1. Begin by finding out as much as possible about the cultures represented in your room and in your community. 2. Ensure that the school is cult urally inclusive visually. Disp lays around the school should represent various backgrounds, cultures, religions and lifestyles. Emphasize the everyday rather than the exotic. 3. Bilingual as well as first language books and di ctionaries, and books written by a wide variety of authors from various cultures, can be part of the school library co llection. The school library should be reviewed regularly to ensure that materials are culturally appropriate. Spanish Language and Culture 9Y Guide to Implementation (7-9) Chapter 6 / 135 Alberta Education, Alberta, Canada 2010 4. Seasonal, holiday and artistic displays in the cl assroom and school should reflect the cultural composition of the school. If cultural and fait h celebrations are honoured within the school, they should be inclusive of all members of the school community. 5. School staff members should be encouraged to decorate their work spaces with items that reflect their cultural backgrounds. Differentiating Learning Activities for English Language Learners It may be necessary to differentiate learning activities for English language learners. Some examples of differentiation for English language learners are listed in the chart below. General Curriculum Focus Whole Group Activity Suggestions for Differentiation Grade 7 Provide information on several aspects of a topic. Using a vocabulary list, students work in groups of two or three to write a short script about friends travelling to a popular Spanish-speaking travel destination. They read the script together. The English language learner will contribute some of the words for the script. He or she may mime parts of the script for the class. Grade 8 Develop reading skills in Spanish. Class reads grade-level story and discusses. The English language learner will highlight words understood. The English language learner will sit with a buddy and follow the text. Grade 9 Explore the use of language for fun and to interpret simple humour. Students listen to or read a variety of traditional songs, folk tales or stories in Spanish. The English language learner may display prior knowledge of a song and teach the song to classmates. Choosing Instructional Strategies Instructional strategies that are effectiv e in teaching second languages are often the same strategies that are effective with E nglish language learne rs. In general, structured cooperative learning activities, group discussions and the use of educational technologies are effective inst ructional strategies for English language learners. 136 / Chapter 6 Spanish Language and Culture 9Y Guide to Implementation (7-9) 2010 Alberta Education, Alberta, Canada Cooperative Learning Cooperative learning activities that incorpor ate predictable routines and structures are integral to a supportive learning environment. Cooperative learning includes students working together in small groups toward a group goal or task completion, students sharing ideas and materials, and students celebrating success based on the performance of the group rather than on the performance of individuals. The benefits of using cooperative learning with English language learners are that it allows them to interact with their peers, it models language and social interactions, it develops positive interdependence and self-confidence, and it allows for repetition of information as the group works together to solve problems. The challenges of using cooperative learning are that English language learners may find it to be a threatening experience, may not be used to expressing personal opinions and/or may not have enough langua ge to interact with their peers. When using cooperative learning as an in structional strategy, teachers should remember to keep groups small, group E nglish language learners carefully, assign roles in each group and monitor group interactions. Group Discussion Similar to cooperative learning, group di scussions allow English language learners to articulate their views and respond to the opinions of others. Group discussions are essential for building background knowledge on specific issues, creating motivation and interest, and exploring new ideas. They also create a sense of belonging and lead to social interactions. The challenges of group discussion are that English language learners may not have sufficient listening comprehension skills, may misinterpret body language and may have difficulty with expressing their persona l opinions, as this may not have been encouraged in their prev ious educational setting. To foster effective group discussions, encourage an atmosphere of openness and acceptance, establish ground rules for discussions, choose topics for discussion carefully and give English language learne rs an opportunity to think before they respond. Technology All students, including English language learners, should become familiar with different types of technology. Some stude nts may have had extensive opportunities to use different technologies, while others may have had limited opportunities. In most cases, students are highly motivated to use any form of technology. Some suggested forms of technology are: electronic journals or diaries interactive projects with different schools or countries chat rooms, news groups, bulletin boards production of audio, video or multimedia assignments structured e-mail interactions For more information ... Chapter 3 For more information ... Chapter 3 Spanish Language and Culture 9Y Guide to Implementation (7-9) Chapter 6 / 137 Alberta Education, Alberta, Canada 2010 submission of assignments via e-mail cross-cultural communication with e-pals writing conferences via e-mail. Using technology benefits students by allowing them to work independently at their own pace, present information in a new way and provide oral presentation of written text (in some cases). Interacting using technology may also be less threatening and intimidating for English language learners than interacting in person. The challenges of using technology include providing instruction on how to use the technologies and monitoring the activity to ensure that students are on task. Assigning partners in the computer lab is a common and valuable strategy. English language learners may need to be introd uced to the North American keyboard. There are many effective educational software programs available for teaching basic computer skills, keyboarding and even second languages. Suggestions for Assessment With English language learners, assessment includes finding out about their background knowledge and about any gaps in their prior education. Accurate assessment of English language learners is difficult because of the varying abilities of these students to expr ess themselves. Some differentiation of assessment practices may be necessary. For example: Have students point to the picture of a correct answer (limit choices). Have students circle a correct answer (limit choices). Instruct students to draw a picture illustrating a concept. Instruct students to match items. Have students complete fill-in-the-blank exercises with the word list provided. Reduce choices on multiple choice tests. Test students orally in English or in the native language. Give open-book tests. Ask students to retell/restate (orally and in writing). Instruct students to define/explain/summarize orally in English or in the native language. Use cloze procedures with outlines, charts, time lines and other graphic organizers. Have students explain (orally and in writing) how an answer was achieved. Have students complete fill-in-the-blank exercises. Have students define/explain/su mmarize (orally and in writing). The bulleted list of assessment practices has been adapted from Pamela Wrigley, The Help! Kit: A Resource Guide for Secondary Teachers of Migrant E nglish Language Learners (Oneonta, NY: ESCORT, 2001), p. 146. Adapted with permission from ESCORT. For more information ...

Some jurisdictions will supply specifically designed report cards for English language learners. Other jurisdictions will modify the regular report card to reflect the program of the English language learner. Still other juri sdictions have developed report cards to reflect the needs of all students and have the capacity to include learning outcomes developed specifically for English language learners. No matter what format is used, it is important that accurate information is shared. Whenever necessary, the services of an interp reter can be used to explain to parents how their children are doing. Teachers can check with local service agencies for lists of available interpreters or ask the fa mily if they have someone they trust to interpret the information for them.

Ass essment should be considered and planned before deciding on learning activities. Assessment approaches and tasks provide the context and direction for learning activities that will be used to build understanding and skills. Assessment Assessment is the gathering and considera tion of information about what a student knows, is able to do and is learning to do . It is integral to the teaching-learning process, facilitating student learning and improving instruction. Assessment and evaluation identify who needs extra support, who needs greater challenge, who needs extra practice and who is ready to move on. The primary goal of assessment and evaluation is to provide ongoing feedback to teachers, students and parents in order to enhance teaching and learning. Chapter 7 Classroom Assessment 140 / Chapter 7 Spanish Language and Culture 9Y Guide to Implementation (7-9) 2010 Alberta Education, Alberta, Canada Teachers consider assessment during all stages of instruction and learning. The assessment process informs teachers as to what students know and what they are able to do in relation to learning outcomes. Informed by a well-designed and implemented assessment process, teache rs are empowered to make sound pedagogical decisions to move students toward the achievement of learning outcomes. Teachers use assessment to: obtain information abou t what students know or are able to do modify instruction improve student performance. Assessment practices should: be part of an ongoing process rather than a set of isolated events focus on both process and product provide opportunities for students to revise their work in order to set goals and improve their learning provide a status report on how well students can demonstrate learning outcomes at a particular time be developmentally appropriate, age- appropriate and gender-balanced and consider students' cultural and special needs include multiple sources of evidence (formal and informal) provide opportunities for students to demonstrate what they know, understand and can do involve students in identifying and/or creating criteria communicate the criteria used to evaluate student work before students begin tasks so that they can plan for success be communicated to students so that th ey understand expectations related to learning outcomes. Also, assessment practices should help and encourage students to: be responsible for their own learning work together to learn and achieve outcomes feel competent and successful set goals for further improvements. Evaluation Evaluation is often confused with assessment. Evaluation is a judgement regarding the quality, value or worth of a student's response, product or performance based on established criteria and curriculum standards. Through evaluation, students receive a clear indication of how well they are performing in relation to learning outcomes. Taken together, the information from assessment and evaluation helps teachers make decisions about what to focus on in the curriculum and when to focus on it. Spanish Language and Culture 9Y Guide to Implementation (7-9) Chapter 7 / 141 Alberta Education, Alberta, Canada 2010 Assessment for Learning (Formative) and Assessment of Learning (Summative) Assessment is generally divided into two categories: assessment for learning (formative assessment) and assessment of learning (summative assessment). For professional discussion and understanding, it is helpful to be aware of these terms and their meanings. Assessment for Learning Assessment for learning is characterized by the ongoing exchange of information about learning between student and self, peer, teacher and parent. It provides information about student progress, allowing the teacher to make program adjustments to best meet the learning need s of a student or class. Assessment for learning provides detailed, descriptive feedb ack through comments. As a result of receiving feedback focused on the learning outcomes, students will have a clearer understanding of what they need to do to improve their future performance. If students are to become competent users of assessment information, they need to be included in the assessment process (Black et al. 2003). Examples of assessment for learning activities include the following: Students learn the names of family members and bring a photograph or drawing of their family to class. They take turns introducing their family members to their peers. Observe students for the demonstration of specific outcomes, such as how well they share basic information and if they communicate words and phrases comprehensibly. Observations are recorded using an outcome-base d observation checklist. Such information effectively informs the planning process, leading to im provement of future student performance in relation to specific learning outcomes. Caution Teachers should be aware that some students may live in foster or group homes and/or may not have a traditional family structure. An alternative activity may be necessary. After hearing Spanish spoken cl early and correctly, students fo rm small groups and read a short passage to one another. Each group sele cts a spokesperson to present the passage to the entire class. The teacher facilitates a discussion on the characteristics of good Spanish pronunciation. Students then summarize some of the characteristics of good pronunciation in their learning logs. This knowledge is us ed to improve students' oral interaction and production skills. Assessment of Learning Assessment of learning most often occurs at the end of a period of instruction, such as a unit or term. It is designed to be summarized in a performance grade and shared with students, parents and others who have a right to know. For more information ... Appendix E 142 / Chapter 7 Spanish Language and Culture 9Y Guide to Implementation (7-9) 2010 Alberta Education, Alberta, Canada Examples of assessment of learning activities include the following: At the conclusion of a unit on \"My Family,\" students prepare a personal collage using pictures of themselves, families, extended families, friends, their favourite activities, foods, books, likes and dislikes. Each picture is labelled in Spanish. The collages are then presented orally in Spanish. An outcome- based rubric is used to evaluate how well students are able to share basic information and use pronunciation comp rehensibly. The rubric is then translated into a grade that can be presented as part of a report card, portfolio or parent-student- teacher conference. Caution Teachers should be aware that some students may live in foster or group homes and/or may not have a typical family structure. An alternative activity may be necessary. At the end of a period of study in which students have had the opportunity to learn and use several relevant vocabulary words, students write a test in which they match a Spanish vocabulary word with the corresponding word in English. The test is marked and contributes to an overall mark in a reporting period. Comparing Assessment for Learning and Assessment of Learning Assessment for Learning (Formative Assessment) Assessment of Learning (Summative Assessment) Checks learning to determine what to do next, then provides suggestions of what to do\u2014teaching and learning are indistinguishable from assessment. Checks what has been learned to date. Is designed to assist educators and students in improving learning. Is designed for the information of those not directly involved in daily learning and teaching (school administration, parents, school board, Alberta Education, post-secondary institutions) in addition to educators and students. Is used continually by providing descriptive feedback. Is presented in a periodic report. Usually uses detailed, specific and descriptive feedback\u2014in a formal or an informal report. Usually compiles data into a single number, score or mark as part of a formal report. Is not reported as part of an achievement grade. Is reported as part of an achievement grade. Usually focuses on improvement, compared with the student's \"previous best\" (self-referenced, making learning more personal). Usually compares the student's learning either with other students' learning (norm-referenced, maki ng learning highly competitive) or with the standard for a grade level (criterion-referen ced, making learning more focused).

Used with permission from Ruth Sutton Ltd.Spanish Language and Culture 9Y Guide to Implementation (7-9) Chapter 7 / 143 Alberta Education, Alberta, Canada 2010 Determining the Assessment Purpose Any assessment strategy can serve both formative and/or summative purposes, depending on how the results are used. In assessment of learning, tests are given to check learning at a given point and are included as part of the report card mark. When planning to administer a test, teach ers can also use assessment for learning strategies. For example: Teachers can collaboratively develop test questions with students. Developing test questions gives an indication of what students know and can do. This helps students understand how to focus their test preparation and helps teachers determine how to most effectively guide student review. Teachers can ask students to rate, on a scale from easy to difficult, what has been learned. This helps students understand how to focus their test preparation and helps teachers determine how to most effectively help students review. Following a test, teachers can as k students to identify what questions they considered to be the most difficult\u2014the ones they found most challenging, not necessarily the questions they got wrong. Teachers can then take this information and work with students to categorize learning outcomes that proved difficult and to facilitate student self-assessment and goal setting. Teachers can administer a nongraded pre-test prior to introducing a new activity. For example, if the instructiona l focus of a game to be played is to learn new vocabulary, students can be given a pre-test to check how well they know that vocabulary. After the learning experience, students can complete the same test and compare their performances. Based on this comparison, students can reflect on their learning in their learning log. It is possible to use the same test for both assessment of learning and assessment for learning. It is up to teachers to dete rmine the purpose and use of the results of assessment strategies. Meaningful Assessment The quality of assessment largely determ ines the quality of evaluation. Valid judgements can be made only if accurate and complete assessment data are collected in a variety of contexts over time. Assessment should occur in authentic cont exts that allow students to demonstrate learning by performing meaningful tasks. Meaningful assessment achieves a purpose and provides clear and useful information. For example, it may identify misunderstandings in student learning and provide corrective feedback and direction for further instruction. Assess ment enhances instruction and learning. Meaningful content and contexts for assessment help students by engaging their attention and encouraging them to share their work and talk about their learning processes. Students need to take an active part in assessment. When students understand assessment criteria and procedur es and take ownership for assessing the quality, quantity and processes of their own work, they develop self-assessment skills. The ultimate goal of assessment is to develop independent lifelong learners who regularly monitor and assess their own progress.

There are several critical factors for teache rs to consider as they plan and develop an effective classroom assessment program. The graphic on the preceding page, \"Assessing Student Learning in th e Classroom,\" outlines a framework for classroom assessment based on the latest research and best practices designed to enhance student learning. The following principles are central to an assessment process that informs teaching practices and enhances student learning. Assessment reflects intended outcomes from the program of studies. General and specific outcomes identify expectations for student achievement across curriculum. These outcomes should be used to articulate evidence and criteria for learning. When outcomes are clustered around a \"big idea\" or concept, they can be used as the basis for articulating expecta tions, selecting strategies and developing activities. Well-aligned units and lesson plans incorporate a series of learning experiences that: clearly identify a cluster of outcomes around a big idea or concept describe what students should understand, know and do to meet the outcomes provide learning activities that lead students to attain the outcomes use instructional approaches or strategies based on indicators of student learning. Teachers should plan assessment activities th at require students to demonstrate what they understand and can do in relati on to the selected outcomes so that valid inferences can be made based on the results. Assessment criteria are clearly communicated. Criteria describe what students are expected to be able to do to meet intended learning outcomes. Criteria need to be written in age-appr opriate language and communicated to students prior to beginning an assessment activity. Sharing criteria with students empowers them to monitor their learning and communicate their progress. Assessment employs a variety of strategies. The most accurate profile of student achievement is based on the findings gathered from assessing student performance in a vari ety of contexts. When teachers use a variety of assessment for learning and assessment of learning strategies consistently, they are able to accurate ly communicate student achievement in relation to the program of studies. For example, some skill outcomes can only be evaluated through performance assessment that provides students with a meaningful real-world context, and in se cond language instruction, observation of personal communication is an essential assessment strategy. 146 / Chapter 7 Spanish Language and Culture 9Y Guide to Implementation (7-9) 2010 Alberta Education, Alberta, Canada Assessment is ongoing. The assessment process has no beginning or end; it is a continuous process that enhances teaching and learning and provides ongoing feedback to teachers, students and parents about student learni ng. Teachers gather information about student learning and consider it as they plan further instruction. They use ongoing student assessment to make decisions on how to best support student learning while students work toward achieving the outcomes in the program of studies. It is not necessary for the teacher to assess all stud ents on all outcomes during a class or an activity. This is often not feasible. As assessment is continuous and ongoing, it can be expected that all students will ev entually be assessed on the ability to meet all outcome objectives. Assessment involves students in the process. Whenever possible, students should be involved in determining the criteria used to evaluate their work. Such involvement leads students to a deeper understanding of what they are expected to know and do. Students should also be involved in the process of identifying their learning needs and goals. Teachers facilitate self-assessment, peer assessment, conferen cing and goal setting to enhance learning and to allow students to become effec tive users of assessment information. Assessment demonstrates sensitivity to individual differences and needs. Assessment affects student motivation and self-esteem and therefore needs to be sensitive to how individual students lear n. \"Accommodations to ... assessment will greatly serve the needs of individual students who have communication, behavioural, intellectual or physical ex ceptionalities .... Such accommodations or adaptations should be made to ensure the most accurate understanding of a student's performance \" (Toronto Catholic District School Board 2001, p. 14). As teachers conference with students, deci sions are made with regard to the next steps in student learning. This includes accommodations for individual student learning needs. Accommodations to programming and asse ssment, including those for English language learners and for students with sp ecial education needs, ensure the most positive impact on student learning and an accurate understanding of student performance. Specific accommodations ma y include adjustments to the kind, breadth, depth and pace of assessment. For more information ... Chapter 6 Suggestions for Assessment Chapter 7 Assessment Accommodations for Students with Special Education Needs Appendix C Examples of Assessment Accommodations Spanish Language and Culture 9Y Guide to Implementation (7-9) Chapter 7 / 147 Alberta Education, Alberta, Canada 2010 Assessment includes many different tools and processes. Assessment tools and processes include: tests and quizzes with constructed-r esponse (performance-based) items and selected-response items (true/false, fill-in-the-blank, multiple choice) reflective assessments, such as jour nals, logs, listen-think-pair-share activities, interviews, self-evaluation activities, and peer response groups academic prompts that clearly specify performance task elements, such as format, audience, topic and purpose culminating assessment projects that allo w for student choice and independent application. Assessment should: be directly connected to cu rriculum expectations and to instructional strategies include various forms, such as observations, anecdotal notes, rating scales, performance tasks, student self-assessment, teacher ques tioning, presentations and learning logs be designed to collect data about what stud ents know and are able to do, about what they need to learn, about what they have achieved and about the effectiveness of the learning experience demonstrate a range of student abilities, skills and knowledge involve sharing the intended outcomes and assessment criteria with students prior to an assessment activity assess before, during and after instruction provide frequent and descriptive feedback to students ensure that students can describe their progress and achievement. 148 / Chapter 7 Spanish Language and Culture 9Y Guide to Implementation (7-9) 2010 Alberta Education, Alberta, Canada Assessment Accommodations for Students with Special Education Needs Assessment may need to be modified or adapted to accommodate students with special education needs. Based on a clea r understanding of the specific needs of a student, teachers can make assessment accommodations related to: kind/task depth/detail breadth/volume pace/timing. The following chart describes examples of these types of assessment accommodations. Accommodation in Kind (Task) Familiarize students with methods being used. Use alternative assessment formats; e.g., oral tests, conferences. Encourage student negotiation of performance tasks. Provide exemplary models. Allow students to practise the activity. Convert short answer questions to a cloze format. Present tasks that begin with the concrete and move to the abstract. Encourage the use of tools such as calculators, dictionari es, word processors and magnifiers. Allow peer support, such as partner work. Accommodation in Depth (Detail) Break down complex tasks into smaller steps. Provide written instructions in addition to verbal directions. Pu t an outline of steps on the board. Include picture clues to support verbal instructions. Modify the format of the evaluation by having fewer questions per page, or limit the overall number of questions. Teach students to attend to key direction words in questions by using a highlighter. Avoid excessive corrections by focusing on fewer expectations. Accommodation in Breadth (Volume) Reduce amount of reading and writing required. Reduce amount of content per assessment task. Provide clear, simple directions for the assessment activity. Allow the use of notes or text during tests to assist students with weak recall, or provide a set of reference notes. Monitor work to ensure time lines are met. Accommodation in Pace (Timing) Provide additional time to complete tasks and tests. Have students repeat and rephrase instructions. Allow students to complete the assessment task over several sessions. Reinforce effective behaviour such as finishing on time and demonstrating commitment to the task. Take into account improvement over time.

For more information ... Chapter 4 Spanish Language and Culture 9Y Guide to Implementation (7-9) Chapter 7 / 149 Alberta Education, Alberta, Canada 2010 Student-directed Assessment Involving students in the assessment process allows them to become effective users of assessment information . Students can become proficient users of student-directed assessment strategies such as conferencing, self-assessment, peer assessment and goal setting. Assessments that directly involve students help them learn important skills that they will be able to use as lifelong learners. They learn to be reflective and responsive, to think about their own efforts, to be constructive in self-assessment and peer assessment, and to provide specific information that makes a difference. When self-assessment activities, goal setti ng and peer assessment are integrated into routine classroom activities, assessment shifts from the teacher as judge and evaluator, to the teacher as coach and fa cilitator. To increase student involvement in the assessment process, teachers should: explain scoring criteria for performan ce-based tests prior to the tests show exemplars of what excellent work looks like whenever possible use language that students understand develop assessment tools collaboratively with students develop self-monitoring and self-assessment tools for different tasks and assignments encourage student goal setting. Conferencing Conferences are usually short, informal mee tings held with individual students or a small group of students and involve diagnostic listening, questioning and responding. Interviews are conferences conduc ted to gather specific information. They may involve a set of questions asked for a specific purpose or a formal set of written questions to which a student responds in writing. For example, teachers may need information about a student's use of text and may use a formal conference or an interview to ask questions directly related to a particular aspect of the student's performance. Sometimes more formal in terviews are conducted regarding student attitudes and metacognitive behaviours. These are often presented as a set of questions or activities to which the student may respond orally, while the teacher records his or her responses. Whether conferences are informal or formal, they are most beneficial for assessment purposes when they are held on a regular basis and both student and teacher come prepared with materials to share and questions to ask. Conference notes form a permanent record of the conten t of the conference and can be used to set goals for future learning. Once students are familiar with conferenci ng procedures, peer conferencing can be used by students to obtain feedb ack and discuss their progress and goals. 150 / Chapter 7 Spanish Language and Culture 9Y Guide to Implementation (7-9) 2010 Alberta Education, Alberta, Canada The purpose of conferencing is to: provide opportunities for students and the teacher to discuss learning strengths and areas for improvement set learning goals learn about students' understanding of in formation, students' attitudes toward learning, and the skills and strategies students employ during the learning process provide opportunities for individualized teaching, guiding students to more challenging materials and determini ng future instructional needs. Tips for Conferencing with Students 1. Ensure that students are aware of the purpose of the conference and of the expectations of participants before the conference begins. 2. Manage conferences by setting aside definite times. 3. Record individual student na mes on a classroom calendar so that students know the day on which their conference will occur. 4. Use a class list to ensure that all students are seen in individual conferences. 5. Allow students to request conferences on a sign-up basis. 6. Ensure that all students select at least a minimum number of conferences (to be determined by the teacher) th roughout the term. 7. Review class records freque ntly to ensure that all stud ents are being seen regularly. 8. Schedule assessment conferences for five to ten minutes with a specific purpose in mind. 9. Maintain a friendly, relaxed atmosphere that promotes trust. 10. Ensure that students are able to work independently so conferences can occur without interruption. Discuss the expectations of all me mbers of the class during conference times. Establish procedures for problem-solving other class issues that may arise during conference times. 11. Schedule conferences more frequently with students having difficulty. 12. Focus on only one or two topics at each conference. 13. Begin and end each conference on a positive note. 14. Review recent anecdotal notes and conference records to identify students in immediate need of conferencing. 15. Understand that students become more invo lved and accept more responsibility for the conference as they become familiar with the process. In a group conference, each student involved has the opportunity to share his or her work, to emphasize what he or she is proud of and to ask questions. Other participants point out what they like about the student's work and offer suggestions for improv ement. It may be useful to observe and record anecdotal notes. Spanish Language and Culture 9Y Guide to Implementation (7-9) Chapter 7 / 151 Alberta Education, Alberta, Canada 2010 Personal Reflection and Self-assessment Personal reflection can be structured by th e teacher or the students and may include personal responses about the learning pro cess. Teachers can effectively model personal reflection for students on a daily basis. When students self-assess, they: reflect on what they have learned and how they learned it monitor and regulate their learning while they are learning see their strengths as well as areas that need work realize that they are responsible for their own learning evaluate the quality of their work and knowledge set goals for future learning and plan ways to achieve their goals see their progress in all curricular areas. Tools such as response journals and learni ng logs can become even more effective when accompanied by the use of prompts or specific questions. In Assessing Student Outcomes , Marzano, Pickering and McTighe offer the following journal writing prompts and questions that help students reflect on their own learning: Reflecting on Content Describe the extent to which you understand the information discussed in class. What are you confident about? What are you confused about? What do you find particularly interesting and thought provoking? Reflecting on Information Processing Describe how effective you were in gathering information for your project. Reflecting on Communication Describe how effective you were in communicating your conclusions to your discussion group. Reflecting on Collaboration and Cooperation Describe how well you worked with your group throughout your project. Assessing their own thinking and learning provides students with valuable training in self-monitoring. One way to have students reflect on their learning is to have them complete sentence stems such as: This piece of work demonstrates that I can ... I can improve my work by ... After reviewing my work, I would like to set a new goal to ... A strategy that worked well for me is ... To maximize learning, teachers can create opportunities for students to compare their own self-assessment information with teacher assessments. This kind of authentic student-teacher interacti on during the assessment process encourages students to honestly and thoughtfully assess th eir own work and take ownership of their own learning. For blackline masters ... Appendix E Self-assessment Checklist, Self-assessment Rating Scale, Self-assessment Checklist and Goal Setting 152 / Chapter 7 Spanish Language and Culture 9Y Guide to Implementation (7-9) 2010 Alberta Education, Alberta, Canada Students can assume more responsibility in the learning process by assessing and/or evaluating their own assignments or projects prior to teacher or peer assessment. Students can also write their own progress report comments and summary-of-learning letters to teachers and parents. Portfolios A portfolio is a purposeful collection of student work samples, student self-assessments and goal statements that reflect student progress. Students generally choose the work samples to pl ace in the portfolio, but the teacher may also recommend that specific work sampl es be included. Portfolios are powerful tools that allow students to see their ac ademic progress from grade to grade. The physical structure of a portfolio refers to the actual arrangement of the work samples, which can be organized according to chronology, subject area, style or goal area. The conceptual structure refe rs to the teacher's goals for student learning. For example, the teacher may have students complete a self-assessment on a work sample and then set a goal for future learning. The work sample self-assessment and the goal sheet are then added to the portfolio. Work samples from all curricular areas, incl uding stories, tests and projects, can be selected and placed in a portfolio. Effective portfolios: are updated regularly to keep th em as current an d complete as possible help students examine their progress help students develop a positive self-concept as learners are shared with parents or guardians are a planned, organized collecti on of student-selected work tell detailed stories about a variety of student outcomes that would otherwise be difficult to document include self-assessments that describe the student as both a learner and an individual serve as a guide for future learning by illustrating a student's present level of achievement include a selection of items that are representative of curriculum outcomes and of what students know and can do include the criteria against which the student work was evaluated support the assessment, evaluation and communication of student learning document learning in a variety of ways\u2014process, product, growth and achievement include a variety of works\u2014audio recordings, video recordings, photographs, graphic organizers, first drafts, journals and assignments that feature work from all of the multiple intelligences. Spanish Language and Culture 9Y Guide to Implementation (7-9) Chapter 7 / 153 Alberta Education, Alberta, Canada 2010 Work samples not only provide reliable in formation about student achievement of the curriculum, but also provide stude nts with a context for assessing their own work and setting meaningful goals for learni ng. Furthermore, displaying concrete samples of student work and sharing assessments that illustrate grade level expectations of the curriculum are key to winning the confidence and support of parents. An essential requirement of portfolios is that students include written reflections that explain why each sample was selected. The power of the portfolio is derived from these descriptions, reactions and me tacognitive reflections. Conferencing with parents, peers and/or teachers helps synthesize learning and celebrate successes. Some students become adep t at writing descriptions and personal reflections of their work without any prompts. For students who have difficulty deciding what to write, sentence starters might be useful; e.g., This piece shows I really understand the content because ... This piece showcases my _______________ intelligence because ... If I could show this piece to anyone\u2014l iving or dead\u2014I would show it to __________________ because ... People who knew me last year would never believe I created this piece because ... This piece was my greatest challenge because ... My (parents, friend, teacher) liked this piece because ... One thing I learned about myself is ... 1 The student descriptions should indicate whether the product was the result of a specifically designed performance task or a regular learning activity. The level of assistance is also relevant\u2014did the studen t complete the work independently, with a partner, with intermittent guidance from the teacher or at home with parent support? Dating the sample, providing a brief context and indicating whether the work is a draft or in completed form are also essential. Goal Setting Goal setting follows naturally out of self-assessment, peer assessment and conferences. Students and teachers decide wh at they need to focus on next in the students' learning, set goals and plan the steps students will take toward achieving their goals. Goals can be either short- or long-term. Short-term goals are small and specific and are likely to be achieved within a br ief period of time. One way to help students set goals is to add a prompt to the end of a self-assessment task; e.g., \"Next time I will ...\". Students set long-term goals when they take an overall look at how they are doing and identify a specific focus for improvement. Long-term goals are bigger and more general and usually require an exte nded period of time to reach, sometimes as long as a few months. 1.

Appendix E Self-assessment Checklist and Goal Setting, Long-term Goal Setting 154 / Chapter 7 Spanish Language and Culture 9Y Guide to Implementation (7-9) 2010 Alberta Education, Alberta, Canada To coach students in setting SMART l earning goals\u2014Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Relevant and Timely (Sutt on 1997)\u2014teachers should advise students to look for strengths in their work as well as areas of potential growth. Students need to set goals that are attain able and appropriate. Teachers can use direct instruction to help students deve lop goal-setting skills. When students set their goals, they need to: consider their strengths consider areas that need improvement use established criteria identify resources they will need to be successful design plans that will enable them to reach their goals share their goals with significant people in their lives plan time lines for goal review and attainment. Students may set specific goals for each of the language arts. Goals may be set for daily activities, for long-term activities or for a term. Once students describe what th ey need to do, they design a specific plan to meet their goals. Teachers ask students to prov ide specific information, such as a date by which they wish to accomplish their goal and the materials and resources they will need. The results of self-assessment, peer assessment and goal setting are used to monitor students' performance and to improve it. In formation gathered can be used to plan for future instruction, but it should not be included in a performance mark for a report card. Learning Logs Learning logs serve to develop student awareness of outcomes and learning processes. With encouragement, guida nce and practice, students develop the ability to reflect on learning activities, identify what they have learned, identify areas in which they need to improve and set personal learning goals. It takes time and practice for students to become adept at such reflective thinking, particularly in the beginning stages. Learning logs kept by students and responded to by the teacher on a regular basis provide an effective assessment for learning tool; they should not be over or underused so that their value is diminished. Guided Reflection Learning logs allow students to monitor their learning and write to the teacher about what help they need in order to improve. Teachers can direct students to focus on a particular area in their learning logs, such as reflecting on a specific experience, or breaking down vocabulary and grammar into categories that indicate levels of understanding, such as \"Got it, Getting it, Don't get it yet.\" Information gained from periodic meetings with students about their learning logs allows teachers to plan how to help students improve.

Appendix D Goal-setting Organizer 1, 2, 3 or 4 Spanish Language and Culture 9Y Guide to Implementation (7-9) Chapter 7 / 155 Alberta Education, Alberta, Canada 2010 Metacognitive Reflection Metacognitive reflection can be defined as thinking about one's own thinking and learning processes. Teachers help stude nts develop metacognitive strategies through direct instruction, modelling and providing opportunities for student practice. In this way, students become effective thinkers who self-monitor and develop control over their thinking processes. Students use their metacognitive skills to reflect on what they have learned, how they have learned it and what they need to do to pursue their learning further. When they engage in metacognitive re flection, students can monitor their own learning and strengthen their will to l earn. Learning logs, conferences and inventories can all be used to help students develop metacognitive awareness. Personal reflection on daily work, as well as on test and examination performances, can expand students' self-know ledge. Students are able to see the progress they make, which in turn improves their self-concept. Learning Lists Lists that facilitate student reflection can also be included in learning logs. To remember particularly challenging words or phrases, students can make lists of these items. Creating lists can help students target their learning by helping them recognize areas in which they need to improve. Peer Assessment Peer assessment allows students to exam ine one another's work as it relates to specific criteria and it allows students to offer encouragement and suggestions for improvement. Peer assessment offers stude nts the opportunity to share with one another their insights about learning Spanish. To facilitate positive and effective peer asse ssment, teachers need to ensure that students understand the criteria and focus on a particular aspect of their peers' work. Students should be coached on gi ving descriptive and constructive feedback so they avoid using broad terms such as \" good\" or \"bad.\" It may be helpful if teachers have students offer two positive comments and one question about their peers' work. Peer assessment could be f acilitated by having students: complete a self-assessment evaluation, using the comments made by their peers complete a peer-assessment checklist a nd discuss the results with the peer, explaining the feedback. For a blackline master ... Appendix E Peer-assessment Checklist 156 / Chapter 7 Spanish Language and Culture 9Y Guide to Implementation (7-9) 2010 Alberta Education, Alberta, Canada Teacher-directed Assessment Teachers use a number of tools to evaluate and assess student performance related to curricular outcomes. By assessing a variety of activities and using different tools, such as rubrics, rating scales and anecdotal notes, teachers obtain a more accurate view of student performance. Checklists, Rating Scales and Rubrics Checklists, rating scales and rubrics are tools that state specific criteria and allow teachers and students to gather information and make judgements about what students know and can do in relation to curricular outcomes. These tools offer systematic ways of collecting data abou t specific behaviours, knowledge and skills. The quality of information acquired through the use of checklists, rating scales and rubrics is highly dependent on the qualit y of the descriptors chosen for the assessment. The benefit of this information is also dependent on students' direct involvement in the assessment and on their understanding of the feedback provided. The purpose of checklists, rating scales and rubrics is to: provide tools for systematic recording of observations provide tools for self-assessment provide criteria to students prior to co llecting and evaluating data on their work record the development of specific skills, strategies, attitudes and behaviours necessary for demonstrating learning clarify students' instructional need s by presenting a record of current accomplishments. Tips for Developing Checklists, Rating Scales and Rubrics 1. Use checklists, rating scales and rubrics in relation to outcomes and standards. 2. Use simple formats that can be understood by students and that will communicate information about student learning to parents. 3. Ensure that the characteristics and descriptor s listed are clear, specific and observable. 4. Encourage students to assist with writing appropriate criteria. For example, what are the descriptors that demonstrate levels of perf ormance for a piece of persuasive writing ? 5. Ensure that checklists, rating scales and ru brics are dated to track progress over time. 6. Leave space to record anecdotal notes or comments. 7. Use generic templates that become familiar to students and that allow for various descriptors to be added quickly to reflect the outcome(s) being assessed. 8. Provide guidance so that students can use and create their own checklists, rating scales and rubrics for self-assessment purposes and as guidelines for goal setting. For blackline masters ... Appendix E Observation Checklist; Checklist and Comments 1 and 2; Rating Scale 1, 2 and 3; Rubric; Rubric and Checklist Spanish Language and Culture 9Y Guide to Implementation (7-9) Chapter 7 / 157 Alberta Education, Alberta, Canada 2010 Checklists usually offer a yes/no format in re lation to student demonstration of specific criteria. They may be used to re cord observations of an individual, a group or a whole class. Rating Scales allow teachers to indicate the degree or frequency of the behaviours, skills and strategies displayed by the student and can show a range of performance levels. Rating scales state the criteria and provide three or four response selections to describe the qua lity or frequency of student work. Teachers can use rating scales to record observations, and students can use them as self-assessment tools. Rating scales also gi ve students information for setting goals and improving performance. Teaching stude nts to use descrip tive words such as always , usually , sometimes and never helps them pinpoint specific strengths and needs. The more precise and descriptiv e the words for each scale point, the more reliable the tool. Effective rating scales use descriptors with clearly understood measures, such as frequency. Scales that rely on subjective descriptors of quality, such as fair, good or excellent , are less effective because the single adjective does not contain enough information on what criteria are indicated at each of these points on the scale. Teachers can increase the assessment value of a checklist or rating scale by adding two or three additional steps that give stud ents an opportunity to identify skills they would like to improve or the skill they feel is most important. For example, teachers can instruct students to: put a star beside the skill they think is the most important circle the skill they would most like to improve underline the skill that is the most challenging for them. Rubrics use a set of specific criteria to evaluate a student's performance. They consist of a fixed measurement scale and detailed descriptions of the characteristics for each level of performance. These descriptions focus on the quality of the product or performance and not the quantity ; e.g., not the number of paragraphs, examples to support an idea, spelling errors. Rubrics are commonly used to evaluate student performance with the inte ntion of including the result in a grade for reporting purposes. Rubrics can increase the consistency and reliability of scoring. They may be used to assess individuals or groups. Developing Rubrics and Scoring Criteria Rubrics are increasingly recognized as a way to both effectively assess student learning and communicate expectations direc tly, clearly and concisely to students. The inclusion of rubrics provides opportuniti es to consider what demonstrations of learning look like, and to describe stag es in the development and growth of knowledge, understandings and sk ills. To be most effective, rubrics should allow students to see the progression of mastery in the development of understandings and skills. Rubrics should be constructed with input from students whenever possible. A good start is to define what quality work looks like based on the learning outcomes. Exemplars of achievement need to be used to demonstrate to students what an excellent or acceptable performance is. On ce the standard is established, it is easy For more ... E Rubric 158 / Chapter 7 Spanish Language and Culture 9Y Guide to Implementation (7-9) 2010 Alberta Education, Alberta, Canada to define what exemplary levels and l ess-than-satisfactory levels of performance look like. The best rubrics have three to five descriptive levels to allow for discrimination in the evaluation of the product or task. Rubrics may be used for summative purposes by assigning a score to each of the various levels. Before developing a rubric, teachers should consider the following: What are the specific curriculum outcomes involved in the task? Do the students have some experience with this or a similar task? What does an excellent performance look like? What are the qualities that distinguish an excellent performance from other levels? What do other responses along the performance quality continuum look like? Teachers can begin by developing criteria to describe the acceptable level. Then they can use Bloom's taxonomy to identify differentiating criteria as they move up the scale. The criteria should not go beyond the original performance task, but should reflect higher thinking skills that students could demonstrate within the parameters of the initial task. When developing the scoring criteria and qua lity levels of a rubric, teachers should consider using the following guidelines: Level 4 is the standard of excellence level. Descriptions should indicate that all aspects of work exceed grade level expectations and show exemplary performance or understanding. This is a \"Wow!\" Level 3 is the approaching standard of excellence level. Descriptions should indicate some aspects of work that exceed grade level expectations and demonstrate solid performance or unde rstanding. This is a \"Yes!\" Level 2 is the meets acceptable standard level. This level should indicate minimal competencies acceptable to meet grade level expectations. Performance and understanding are emergi ng or developing but there are some errors and mastery is not thorough. This is an \"On the right track, but ...\". Level 1 is the does not yet meet acceptable standard level. This level indicates what is not adequate for grade level expectations and indicates that the student has serious errors, omissions or misconceptions. This is a \"No, but ...\". The teacher needs to make decisions about appropriate intervention to help the student improve. Teachers may choose to increase or decrease th e number of levels for the rubric, as well as the amount of detail within each level. Spanish Language and Culture 9Y Guide to Implementation (7-9) Chapter 7 / 159 Alberta Education, Alberta, Canada 2010 It is important to be clear what it is teachers are assessing in a rubric. Content may be the focus, or performance, and within each category there are a number of subcategories. Below is a rubric of descr iptors that teachers can use as a standard for the rating of parameters. The rubric may be useful when composing level descriptions. Evaluation of Content and Performance Meets Excellence Exceeds Acceptable Meets Acceptable Approaches Acceptable A.

Students do better when they know th e goal, see models and know how their performance compares to learning outcomes. Learning outcomes are clarified when student s assist in describing the criteria used to evaluate performance. Teachers can use brainstorming and discussion to help students analyze what each level looks like. Student-friendly language can be used and students can be encouraged to identify descriptors that are meaningful to them. Teachers can provide work samples to he lp students practise and analyze specific criteria for developing a critical elements list, which can then be used to develop descriptions for each performance level. Although rubrics are often used as assessment of learning tools, they can also be used as assessment for learning tools. Students can benefit from using rubrics as they become more competent at judging the quality of their work and examining their own progress. For example: Teachers can involve students in th e assessment process by having them participate in the creation of a rubric. This process facilitates a deeper understanding of the intended outcomes and the associated assessment criteria. After a rubric has been created, students can use it to guide their learning. Criteria described in a rubric serve to focus student reflection on their work and facilitate the setting of learning goals for a particular performance assessment. Students can use a rubric to assess their own work or the work of a peer, and they can use it to guide th eir planning for the \"next steps\" in learning. Informal Observation Informal observation is an integral part of ongoing instruction. Informal assessments include observations of students as they engage in authentic reading tasks, conferences with students about work in progress or completed assignments, and discussions with students regarding their awareness of the strategies they use to construct meaning from print. Teachers can make mental notes of the extent to which students are able to meet outcom es and can offer feedback, encouragement and praise as needed. Spanish Language and Culture 9Y Guide to Implementation (7-9) Chapter 7 / 161 Alberta Education, Alberta, Canada 2010 Anecdotal Notes Anecdotal notes are used to record speci fic observations of individual student behaviours, skills and attitudes as they relate to the outcomes in the program of studies. Such notes provide cumulative information on student learning and direction for further instruction . Anecdotal notes are often written as a result of ongoing observations during lessons but may also be written in response to a product or performance the student has completed. They are brief, objective and focused on specific outcomes. Notes taken during or immediately following an activity are generally the most accurate. Anecdotal notes for a particular student can be periodically shared with that stud ent or shared at the student's request. They can also be shared with student s and parents at parent-teacher-student conferences. The purpose of anecdotal notes is to: provide information regarding a student 's development over a period of time provide ongoing records about individual instructional needs capture observations of significant beha viours that might otherwise be lost provide ongoing documentation of learning that may be shared with students, parents and other teachers. Tips for Establishing and Maintaining Anecdotal Notes 1. Keep a binder with a separate page for ea ch student. Record observations, using a clipboard and sticky notes. Write the date and the student's name on each sticky note. Following the note taking, place individual sticky notes on the page reserved for that student in the binder. OR Keep a binder with dividers for each student and blank pages to jot down notes. The pages may be divided into three columns: Date, Observ ation and Action Plan. Keep a class list in the front of the binder and check off each student's name as anecdotal notes are added to his or her section of the binder. This provides a quick reference of the students you have observed and how frequently you have observed them. 2. Keep notes brief and focused (usually no more than a few sent ences or phrases). 3. Note the context and any comments or questions for follow-up. 4. Keep comments objective. Make specific comments about student strengths, especially after several observations have been re corded and a pattern has been observed. 5. Record as the observations are be ing made, or as soon after as possible, so recollections will be accurate. 6. Record comments regularly, if possible. 7. Record at different times and during different activities to develop a balanced profile of student learning. 8. Review the notes frequently to ensure that they are being made on each student regularly, and summarize information related to trends in students' learning. For a blackline master ... Appendix E Anecdotal Notes 162 / Chapter 7 Spanish Language and Culture 9Y Guide to Implementation (7-9) 2010 Alberta Education, Alberta, Canada Observation Checklist Observing students as they solve problems, model skills to others, think aloud during a sequence of activities or interact w ith peers in different learning situations provides insight into student learning and growth. The teacher finds out the conditions that are most likely to bri ng success, what individual students do when they encounter difficulty, how interaction with others affects students' learning and concentration, and what students need to learn in the future. Observations may be informal or highly structured; they may be incidental or scheduled over different periods of time in different learning contexts. Observation checklists allow teachers to record information quickly about how students perform in relation to specific outcomes from the program of studies. Observation checklists, written in a yes/no fo rmat can be used to assist in observing student performance relative to specific crite ria. They may be directed toward observations of an individual or a group. An observation checklist can also include spaces for brief comments, which provide additional information not captured in the checklist. Before using an observation checklist, teachers should ensure that students understand what information will be gather ed and how it will be used. Checklists should be dated to provide a record of observations over a period of time. Tips for Using Observation Checklists 1. Determine the specific outcomes to observe and assess. 2. Decide what to look for. Write down criter ia or evidence that indicates the student is demonstrating the outcomes. 3. Ensure students know and understand what the criteria are. 4. Target your observation by selecting four to five students per class and one or two specific outcomes to observe. 5. Collect observations over a number of clas ses during a reporting period and look for patterns of performance. 6. Date all observations. 7. Share observations with students, both individu ally and in a group. Make the observations specific and describe how this demonstrates or promotes thinking and learning. For example: \"Eric, you contributed several ideas to your group's Top Ten list. You really helped your group finish the task within the time limit.\" 8. Use the information gathered from observation to enhance or modify future instruction. Question and Answer Questioning can serve as an assessment tool when it is related to outcomes. Teachers use questioning (usua lly oral) to discover what students know and can do. Strategies for effective question and answer assessment include the following: Apply a wait time or \"no hands up rule\" to provide students with time to think about a question before they are called upon randomly to respond. For blackline master ... Appendix E Observation Checklist For more information ... Chapter 1 Bloom's Taxonomy Spanish Language and Culture 9Y Guide to Implementation (7-9) Chapter 7 / 163 Alberta Education, Alberta, Canada 2010 Ask a variety of questions, including open-ended questions and those that require more than a right or wrong answer. Use Bloom's Taxonomy when developing questions to promote higher-order thinking. Teachers can record the results of quest ions and answers in anecdotal notes and include them as part of their planning to improve student learning. Quizzes Quizzes generally check for student learning as it relates to a single outcome or to several outcomes. Quizzes can be used to measure student achievement of outcomes pertaining to knowledge and comp rehension skills. Care must be taken to ensure that students' grades do not become unbalanced by including an overabundance of results from quizzes. Different purposes for quizzes: Graded quizzes check for learning on a few items that have been introduced and practised in class. Nongraded, pre- and post-quizzes check for student learning before and after an activity. Quizzes facilitate self-assessment and goal setting when students reflect on their quiz performance. Tests and Examinations Tests and examinations are generally summative assessment tools that provide information about what students know and can do after a period of study. Tests and examinations are generally used by teachers to cover several outcomes at one time, and therefore do not appear in the grade level samples section of this resource as evaluation tools. Questions on tests and examinations need to be aligned with the outcomes from the program of studies to ensure valid results. Analysis of Test and Examination Results Teachers can help students improve their performances on assessment of learning tasks by ensuring that students have an area in their learning logs dedicated to analysis of test and examination results. Students record the concepts they found challenging on a test or an examination. Periodically, teachers can ask students to review the concepts they have described as challenging and ask them to look for patterns. Such observations can form th e basis of a student-teacher conference and help the student develop a study plan that aims to improve his or her learning. These observations could also help parents understand how best to help their child develop language learning skills. Teacher s may use the information gathered from this part of the learning log to help plan future programming. 164 / Chapter 7 Spanish Language and Culture 9Y Guide to Implementation (7-9) 2010 Alberta Education, Alberta, Canada Performance Assessment \"A performance assessment is an activity that re quires students to construct a response, create a product or demonstrate a skill they have acquired\" (Alberta Assessment Consortium 2000, p. 5). Performance assessments are concerned w ith how students apply the knowledge, skills, strategies and attitudes they have learned to new and authentic tasks. Performance tasks are short activities that provide an opportunity for students to demonstrate knowledge, skills and strategi es. They are highly structured and require students to complete specific elements. They may be content-specific or interdisciplinary and relate to the real -life application of knowledge, skills and strategies. Performance assessments focus on simulated real-life situations. The approach is student-centred; therefore, the learner's context serves as one of the organizing elements in the development process. To create a performance assessment, teach ers should decide which outcomes are to be met and establish specific criteria (how students will demonstrate knowledge and understanding) to indicate whether or not students have met those outcomes. Rubrics or scoring guides that indicate the criteria for different levels of student performance are commonly used to evaluate a student's performance. Results from performance assessments should account for th e largest percentage of a student's grade as they are a clear indicator of student understanding of the outcomes. \"When students are given or create tasks that are meaningful, non-contrived and consequential, they are more likely to take them seriously and be engaged by them\" (Schlechty 1997). Performance assessment is: Contextualized Students are provided with a meaningful context for real language use. Tasks are organized around one theme, which helps to ground the students in the context. The students know what task they are to complete and with whom they are to interact. Authentic Tasks are designed to present students with a real communicative purpose for a real audience. Task-based Students must follow a well-defined process to create and/or present a product in a way that elicits specific use of the second language. Performance assessment is Contextualized, Authentic, Task-based , Learner-centred: Adapted with permission from the Center for Advanced Research on Language Acquisition, University of Minnesota, Developing Speaking and Writing Tasks for Second Language Assessment (The Minnesota L anguage Proficiency Assessments [MLPA] : A MLPA Miniguide for Assessment Development) (Minneapolis, MN: Center for Advanced Research on Langua ge Acquisition, University of Minnesota, n.d.), p. 3. Spanish Language and Culture 9Y Guide to Implementation (7-9) Chapter 7 / 165 Alberta Education, Alberta, Canada 2010 Learner-centred Tasks are realistic for students learni ng the second language in terms of age, cultural background and level of cognitive and linguistic maturity. Students are expected to create and/or present products based on their actual circumstances, backgrounds and interests. Performance assessments help student s understand their development of communicative competence. Such assessmen ts make it easy for students to see how they are progressing in their abilities to use the language effectively. Performance assessment instruments need to be flexible enough to be appropriate for every student in a classroom, allowi ng each student to demonstrate personal meaning. A description of the performance assessme nt task and the evaluation tool (e.g., rubric, checklist) should be provided to students at the beginning of a unit of instruction to guide and focus student learning. Teachers can visit the Alberta Assessment Consortium Web site at http://www.aac.ab.ca for further guidance in developing and using performance assessments and for samples of performance assessment tasks in Spanish.

( Note : Only a few of the required grammatical elements for grades 7-9 have been addressed in the samples. Teachers need to ensure that all of the grammatical elements from the program of studies are addressed through classroom instruction and activities.) The sample teaching and learning activities and assessment strategies are suggestions only . They are provided for the primary purpose of clarifying the intent of each specific outcome. Each sample provides a concrete example of how a specific outcome might be accomplished and assessed in the classroom. Teachers can use the samples to gain clarity as to th e intent of each specific outcome and as a springboard for their lesson planning. Th e activities are arranged in clusters and clusters are organized according to the order of outcomes in the program of studies. Teachers are encouraged to read and use the activities when they address a particular outcome and to adjust the activities as they need. Teachers should not be concerned about addressing outcomes in chronological order. Chapter 8 Grade Level Samples 168 / Chapter 8 Spanish Language and Culture 9Y Guide to Implementation (7-9) 2010 Alberta Education, Alberta, Canada Integrate for Efficiency and Motivation In the time allotted for each grade level of the program, it is impossible to complete a separate activity and assessment for each specific outcome in the program of studies. Teachers usually plan to cover several outcomes in each lesson. As teachers plan their units and lessons, they are encouraged to integrate outcomes from all four program components: Applications, Language Competence, Global Citizenship and Strategies. Such integration, coupled with a strong focus on Applications, motivates students to become active partners in learning and to take personal responsibility for their own learning. The \"Clusters\" Model The activities provided in this grade le vel samples section are grouped into \"clusters\" based on the cluster headings from the program of studies. Cluster headings show the scope of each of the f our general outcomes. For Grade 7, there are 16 clusters, one for each cluster heading listed in the program of studies. For grades 8 and 9 there are only six clusters, one for each cluster heading of the Applications section. Each cluster contains activities that can help students meet the specific outcome objectives of the clus ter heading. An examination of the activities suggested in each cluster will s how that they vary in difficulty and complexity and in the time required to ca rry them out successfully. Some activities may be continued over several weeks or months as ongoing projects while others may be planned and completed in one or two class periods. Teachers should ensure, therefore, that judicious selection of activities is made in terms of the learners' needs, interests, language and other skills as well as the available resources and instructional time. Here is a breakdown of a cluster: The Overview Page The cluster heading appears in the top ri ght-hand corner of the page; e.g., A-1 Students will use Spanish to impart and receive information. The specific outcome(s) for the particular grade and cluster heading are listed first, then all of the specific outcomes that are incorporated in the cluster activities are listed in order of the four program components. Cluster Activities Each activity highlights an outcome fro m the cluster heading and incorporates outcomes from the other program of studies components. Regardless of the cluster heading outcome(s) highlighted, every ac tivity is driven by the Applications component; in other words, students will be actively applying Spanish in some form or other. Principal and Supporting Outcomes are specified for each cluster activity; these are only samples of the many outcomes that coul d be emphasized in the activity. This short list is primarily intended as an aid to help the teacher become, and remain, Spanish Language and Culture 9Y Guide to Implementation (7-9) Chapter 8 / 169 Alberta Education, Alberta, Canada 2010 aware of the many possible skills required in an activity, all of which, in the end, relate to attaining a set of global language skills. In other words, the intended focus is on selected outcomes while many other ancillary skills/outcomes are concurrently and incidentally addressed. It is the teacher's responsibility to ensure that all outcomes from the program of studies are addressed with students. Required materials, prerequisite knowledge and sample vocabulary are included for each activity as are two sample evaluation tools. The evaluation tools are meant to formatively assess student work. Some tools are designed for teacher use and others for student use. Teachers and st udents may use the tools provided or adapt these tools to better meet their needs.

C-21 C-2 Spanish Language and Culture 9Y Guide to Implementation (7-9) 2010 Alberta Education, Alberta, Canada Instructional Planning Guide As you design a learning activity, consider students' individual needs and learning profiles to determine the accommodations, modifications and adaptations that will be necessary for success. Outcomes Determine the outcomes that students can reasonably accomplish. Select fewer outcomes, partial outcomes or outcomes from a different grade level if necessary. Determine what the students will be able to demonstrate as a result of this learning activity. Consider the accommodations, modifications and adaptations necessary to ensure student success in achieving all or part of the outcomes. Learning Activities Select appropriate instructional strategies and learning activities that will create opportunities for students to successf ully achieve the target outcomes. Decide how students will apply their learning. Ensure opportunities for students to use different learning modalities; e.g., visual, auditory. Present and support key concepts and instructions by using demonstration, oral and written steps and exemplars of completed assignments. Break down assignments or tasks into smaller, more manageable parts. Give clear, concrete instructions and: ___ provide a visual reference of the sequen ce of key steps in completing the assignment ___ provide a checklist of assignment parts for students to mark as tasks are completed ___ support written instructions with picture prompts, or highlight directions using a colour-coding system ___ record directions or lectures for playback ___ repeat instructions ___ have students recall instructions in sequence. Model and demonstrate to prom ote understanding of directions. Check in with students regularly to check their un derstanding of the task and to provide feedback and clarification on specific aspects of the assignment. Highlight key points of the lesson orally and visually. Select extension activities that will reinforce and extend learning. Write assignments and homework on chart paper or the board. Ensure that students write down assignments in their agendas. Help students stay on task by employing a cueing strategy. Identify the key concepts of the learning activity. Consider how the activity has been designed to motivate and engage student interest. Determine how to present an overview of the learning activity. Ensure that the learning activity provides opportun ities for students to relate the key concepts to their own experiences or understanding. Build in opportunities for students to make conn ections between what they know and what they are learning. Instructional Planning Guide: Adapted with permissi on from Calgary Learning Centre (Calgary, Alberta, 2003). Spanish Language and Culture 9Y Guide to Implementation (7-9) C-3 Alberta Education, Alberta, Canada 2010 Consider how the students will be organized for instruction and the type of groupings that will be most effective (partner, small group, large group). Use flexible grouping to determine the best fit for a particular activity. Decisions about grouping students may be based on different factors depe nding on the end goal, such as learning profile, interest, readiness or need. Learning Environment Consider the classroom environment and individual student work spaces. Provide a quiet work station like a study carrel in a corner of the classroom. Plan seating arrangements for students with atte ntion issues based on traffic patterns and overt distractions; e.g., windows, door, hallway, computer. Partner students with a peer for support and guidance. Resources Decide on the resources that will be used for the learning activity, including oral, print and multimedia texts and community resources. Locate necessary materials and resources to supp ort different reading levels, learning styles and student needs. Consider using graphic organi zers to present information. Prepare resources to assist students with learning difficulties. Rewrite materials at a lower reading level. Provide a graphic organizer for note taking; e.g., cloze style. Highlight passages of text. Reformat handouts and tests as necessary; e. g., provide lines for written responses, put one question per page, rewrite questions or information at a lower r eading level, enlarge print and spacing between lines of print. Identify Web-based supports; e.g., simulations. Ensure that students have the assistive tools and devices to support their learning styles or needs; for example: ___ highlighters, calculators, sticky notes, rulers, markers, erasable pens, adapted scissors, graph paper, special lined paper, pencil gr ip, date/number line taped to desk ___ a copy of the lecture notes ___ enlarged or reduced text ___ scribe ___ audio recordings ___ picture prompts ___ manipulatives ___ overlays ___ computers C-4 Spanish Language and Culture 9Y Guide to Implementation (7-9) 2010 Alberta Education, Alberta, Canada Assessment Decide what evidence will show whether the students have achieved the outcomes. Determine the best way for students to demonstrate their learning. Provide assessment options for students to \"show what they know.\" Make necessary preparations for alter native testing procedures, resources and materials. Does the student need: ___ an audio recording of the test ___ a scribe to write down his or her ideas or answers ___ the test questions read aloud ___ a time extension ___ fewer questions? Determine the focus of the assessment for evaluation purposes. For example, if you are evaluating students on their understanding of the content, do not penalize them for spelling errors or missed punctuation. Select or develop rubrics, exemplars and checklists to support student evaluation. Provide immediate, specific and constructive feedback. Emphasize the quality of work and persever ance rather than emphasizing quantity. Provide opportunities for student self-reflection and self-evaluation. Consider necessary alternative assessment options to accommodate different learning styles, interests or strengths. Share assignment criteria lists, checklists, standards and exemplars with students. Time Line Record important assignments and text due dates on a master calendar and have students write these dates in their agendas. Show students how to plan for long er assignments by using a calendar. Show students how to study for an upcoming test. Provide students with a study guide of important skills and concepts. Consider the pace of the learning activity and the needs of the students. Consider ways to change the pace and allow st udents to focus on the task for more condensed periods of time, if necessary. Prepare an assignment summary with task incr ements and a time line to guide students' completion of the assignment. Provide time warnings for task completion. Extend deadlines for those students who requi re more time to complete assignments.

Review the strategies below and mark the column that best fits your current practice for helping students focus on what is important in the learning activity. Yes Not Yet I reduce distractions for my students; e.g., close the door, move students near the front and away from windows. I communicate clearly what my expecta tions of the students are during the class. I provide students with some form of an advanced organizer at the beginning of class to alert them to what will be addressed in the learning activity. I consistently review and encourage recall of previously presented information; e.g., summarizing, asking questions, allowing time to review previous notes and handouts. I use cue words and phrases to signal important information; e.g., In summary ..., Note the following ..., Pa y attention to ..., Record this important fact ..., This is important ..., Listen carefully. I use transitional phrases to cue and si gnal the organization of information; e.g., first, second, third; next; before/after; finally. I highlight important information by us ing bold, italics and different coloured text. I vary my volume, tone of voice and rate of speech to emphasize important ideas and concepts. I present information in many different ways; e.g., discussion, video, audio, small group assignments, transparencies, slide show presentations. I repeat important ideas and concepts by rephrasing and using multiple examples. I write important ideas, key concept s and vocabulary on the board or on an overhead transparency. I use visual aids and objects to support the concepts and information that are presented; e.g., pictures, diagrams, maps, manipulatives, graphic organizers, overhead projector. I provide examples and non-examples of concepts. I frequently check for understanding; e. g., ask questions during the class, encourage students to ask questions during and after a presentation, encourage students to relate new information to old. I provide students with opportunities to discuss concepts with a partner or small group. I provide students with opportunities to work with and/or practise new skills and concepts. I allow time for reflection at the end of the class; e.g., time for students to review important ideas, summarize, ask questions, self-evaluate. I briefly review the important concepts at the end of the class and preview what will be happening in the next class.

Spanish Language and Culture 9Y Guide to Implementation (7-9) C-15 Alberta Education, Alberta, Canada 2010 C-16 Spanish Language and Culture 9Y Guide to Implementation (7-9) 2010 Alberta Education, Alberta, Canada Examples of Assessment Accommodations Some students require accommodations to allow classroom assessment to measure and communicate student growth and achievement clearly and realistically. Some students will know what they need to demonstrate their knowledge in the classroom and in testing situations. It is important to provide an opportunity for students and parents to suggest or respond to proposed assessment accommodations. Sample assessment accommodations include: allowing extended time allowing breaks during the test reducing the number of questions breaking a test into parts and admi nistering them at separate times providing an audio recorded test and making stud ents aware that they may listen to part or all of the recording more than once providing a reader or a scribe providing an opportunity to record answers providing more detailed instructions and confir ming the student's understanding of the test process administering the test in a small-group setting or to an individual student administering the test in a separate room, free from distractions providing noise buffers; e.g., headphones adjusting the test appearance; e.g., margins, spacing adjusting the test design (true/false, multiple choice, matching) adjusting the readability of the test allowing alternative formats, such as webs or key points in place of essays or long answers reading test questions allowing oral examinations allowing students to practise taking similar test questions.

Spanish Language and Culture 9Y Guide to Implementation (7-9) D-11 Alberta Education, Alberta, Canada 2010 How to Create a Mind Map What are mind maps? Mind maps are diagrams that show related ideas and information on a topic. They are used to note and organize ideas and information in a way that is meaningful to you. How do I create a mind map? Identify your topic and write it in the centre of the page. This is the centre of your mind map. As you think of a subtopic related to your main topic, write it next to the centre and connect it with a line. Use different colours or styles of writing for your different subtopics. Add information and ideas to the subtopics as you think of them and connect them in meaningful ways. Include ideas and information, such as: examples from your own experience things you have read or heard questions you want to answer feelings you have sketches. Review the ideas and information you have written down and use circles, other shapes and/or colours to connect or group things. You can use mind maps for many things, such as: collecting ideas, information and questions to guide your research reflecting on a presentation, group discussion, story, movie or television show collecting ideas for a story, poem, role-play or skit.
