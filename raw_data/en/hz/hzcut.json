Best Practices for Cleaning, Disinfection and Sterilization in All Health Care Settings | May 2013 6 Preamble About This Document This document is intended for health care providers to ensure that the critical elements and methods of decontamination, disinfection and sterilization are incorporated into health care facility procedures. The document describes essential elements and methods in the safe handling, monitoring and auditing, transportation and biological decontamina tion of contaminated medical equipment/devices. Information in this document is consistent with, or exceeds, recommendations from the Public Health Agency of Canada. It also meets standards developed by the Canadian Standards Association and reflects posit ion statements of the Ontario Hospital Association. As such, it may be used as a basis for auditing reprocessing practice in any health care setting in Ontario. FOR RECOMMENDATIONS IN THIS DOCUMENT: Shall indicates mandatory requirements based on legislated requirements or national standards (e.g., Canadian Standards Association - CSA). Must indicates best practice, i.e., the minimum standard based on current recommendations in the medical literature. Should indicat es a recommendation or that which is advised but not mandatory. May indicates an advisory or optional statement. Evidence for Recommendations The best practices in this document reflect the best evidence and expert opinion on the reprocessing of medical equipment/devices and legislated standards available at the time of writing. As new information becomes available, this document will be reviewe d and updated. Users must be cognizant of the basic principles of reprocessing and safe use of medical equipment/devices when making decisions about new equipment/devices and methodologies that might become available. Refer to Appendix A , 'Ranking System f or Recommendations ', for grading system used for recommendations. How and When to Use This Document The best practices for reprocessing medical equipment set out in this document should be practiced in all settings where care is provided, across the cont inuum of health care. This includes settings where emergency (including pre -hospital) care is provided, hospitals, complex continuing care facilities, rehabilitation facilities, long -term care homes, outpatient clinics, community health centres and clinics , independent health facilities, out of hospital premises, physician offices, dental offices, offices of other health professionals, public h ealth and home health care . Best Practices for Cleaning, Disinfection and Sterilization in All Health Care Settings | May 2013 7 This document deals with medical equipment/devices that are used on humans. Instruments that contact animals or animal tissues (e.g., research animals) should never be used on humans and must not be reprocessed in the same processing areas as equipment/devices that are used on humans. All reprocessing of equipment/devices, regardless of sou rce, must meet these best practices whether the equipment/device is purchased, loaned, physician/practitioner -owned, research equipment/device or obtained by any other method. Assumptions for Best Practices in Infection Prevention and Control The best practices in this document are based on the assumption that health care settings in Ontario already have basic infection prevention and control (IPAC) systems and programs in place.5 Health care settings that do not have Infection Control Professionals should work with o rganizations that have infection prevention and control expertise, such as academic health science centres, regional infection control networks (RICN) , public health units that have professional staff certified in IPAC and local IPAC associations (e.g., Co mmunity and Hospital Infection Control Association (CHICA) - Canada chapters), to develop evidence -based programs. In addition to the above general assumption about basic IPAC , these best practices are based on the following additional assumptions and prin ciples: 1. Adequate resources are devoted to IPAC in all health care settings. See PIDAC's Best Practices for Infection Prevention and Control Programs in Ontario ,5 available Best practices to prevent and control the spread of infectious diseases are routin ely implemented in all health care settings, in accordance with PIDAC'S Routine Practices and Additional Precautions in All Health Care Settings ,6 available Programs are in place in all health care settings that promot e good hand hygiene practices and ensure adherence to standards for hand hygiene. See: a) PIDAC's Best Practices for Hand Hygiene in All Health Care Settings ,7 available d hygiene improvement program, Just Clean Your Hands ,8 available at: http://www.oahpp.ca/services/jcyh/ . 4. Adequate resources are devoted to Environmental Services/Housekeeping in all health care settings that include written procedures for cleaning and disinfection of client/patient/resident rooms and equipment; education of new cleaning staff and continuing education of all cleaning staff; and ongoing review of procedures. See PIDAC's Best Practices for Environmental Cleaning in All Health Care Settings ,9 available Regular education (including orientation and continuing education) and support is provided in all hea lth care settings to help staff consistently implement appropriate IPAC practices. Effective education programs emphasize : the risks associated with infectious diseases, including acute respiratory illness and gastroenteritis hand hygiene, including the us e of alcohol -based hand rubs and hand washing Best Practices for Cleaning, Disinfection and Sterilization in All Health Care Settings | May 2013 8 principles and components of Routine Practices as well as additional transmission -based precautions (Additional Precautions) assessment of the risk of infection transmission and the appropriate use of personal protective equipment (PPE), including safe application, removal and disposal appropriate cleaning and/or disinfection of health care equipment, supplies and surfaces or items in the health care environment individual staff responsibility for keeping clie nts/patients/residents, themselves and co -workers safe collaboration between professionals involved in occupational health and IPAC. NOTE: Education programs should be flexible enough to meet the diverse needs of the range of health care providers and other staff who wo rk in the health care setting. The local public health unit and regional infection control networks may be a resource and can provide assistance in developing and providing education programs for community settings. 6. Collaboration between professionals involved in OHS and IPAC is promoted in all health care settings to implement and maintain appropriate IPAC standards that protect workers. 7. There are effective working relationships between the health care setting and local Public H ealth. Clear lines of co mmunication are maintained and P ublic Health is contacted for information and advice as required and the obligations (under the Health Protection and Promotion Act , R.S.O. 1990, c.H.7)10 to report reportable and communicable diseases is fulfilled. Public Health provides regular aggregate reports of outbreaks of reportable infecti ous diseases in facilities and/or in the community to all health care settings. 8. Access to ongoing IPAC advice and guidance to support staff and resolve differences are available to the health care setting. 9. There are established procedures for receiving and responding appropriately to all international, national, regional and local health advisories in all health care settings. H ealth advisories are communicated promptly to all affected staff and regular updates are provided . Current advis ories are available from local public h ealth units, the Ministry of Health and Long -Term Care (MOHLTC) , Health Canada and Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) websites and local RICN . 10. Where applicable, there is a process for evaluating personal protective equipment (PPE) in the health care setting, to ensure it meets quality standards. 11. There is regular assessment of the effectiveness of the infection prevention and control program and its impact on practices in the health care setting. The information is used to further refi ne the program.5 Occupational Health and Safety requirements shall be met: Health care facilities are required to comply with applicable provisions of the Occupational Health and Safety Act (OHSA), R.S.O. 1990, c.0.1 and its Regulations.11 Employers, supervisors and workers have rights, duties and obligations under the OHSA. Specific requirements under the OHSA and its regulations are available at: Occupational Health and Safety Act : http://www.e - laws.gov.on.ca/html/statutes/english/elaws_statutes_90o01_e.htm Ontario Regulation 67/93 Health care and Residential Facilities : http://www.e - laws.gov.on.ca/html/regs/english/elaws_regs_930067_e.htm The Occupational Health and Safety Act places duties on many different categories of individuals associated with workplaces, such as employers, constructors, supervisors, owners , suppliers, licensees, Best Practices for Cleaning, Disinfection and Sterilization in All Health Care Settings | May 2013 9 officers of a corporation and workers. A guide to the requirements of the Occupational Health and Safety Act may be found at: http://www.labour.gov.on.ca/eng lish/hs/pubs/ohsa/index.php . The OHSA section 25(2)(h), the ' general duty clause' , requires an employer to take every precaution reasonable in the circumstances for the protection of a worker. Specific requirements for certain health care and residential f acilities may be found in the Regulation for Health Care and Residential Facilities , available at: http://www.e - laws.gov.on.ca/html/regs/english/elaws_regs_930067_e.htm . Under that regulation there are a number of requirements, including: Requirements for an employer to establish written measures and procedures for the health and safety of workers, in consultation with the joint health and safety committee or health and safety representative, if any. Such measures and procedures may include, but are not limited to, the following : safe work practices safe working conditions proper hygiene practices and the use of hygiene facilities the control of infections immunization and inoculation against infectious diseases. The requirement that at least once a year the measures and procedures for the health and safety of workers shall be reviewed and revised in the light of current knowledge and practice. A requirement that the employer, in consultation with the joint health and safety committee or health and safety representative, if any, shall develop, establish and provide training and educational programs in health and safety measures and procedures for workers that are relevant to the workers' work. A worker who is required by his or her employer or by the Regulation for Health Care and Residential Facilities to wear or use any protective clothi ng, equipment or device shall be instructed and trained in its care, use and limitations before wearing or using it for the first time and at regular intervals thereafter and the worker shall participate in such instruction and training. The employer is r eminded of the need to be able to demonstrate training, and is therefore encouraged to document the workers trained, the dates training was conducted, and the information and materials covered during training. Under the Occupational Health and Safety Act , a worker must work in compliance with the Act and its regulations, and use or wear any equipment, protective devices or clothing required by the employer. The Needle Safety Regulation (O.Reg 474/07)12 has requirements related to the use of hollow - bore needles that are safety -engineered needles.

Best Practices for Cleaning, Disinfection and Sterilization in All Health Care Settings | May 2013 10 I. Best Practices for Cleaning, Disinfection and Sterilization in All Health Care Settings TERMS USED IN THIS DOCUMENT (see glossary for details and examples) Health Care Provider: Any person delivering care to a client/ patient /resident . Staff: Anyone conducting activities within a health care setting (includes health care providers). Health Care Setting: Any location where health care is provided, including settings where emergency care is provided, hospitals, complex continuing care, rehabilitation hospitals, long -term care homes, mental health facilities, outpatient clinics, community health centres and clinics, physician offices, dental offices, offices of other health professionals and home health care. Infection is a major risk of surgery and infections related to improper equipment reprocessing still occur, despite modern technologies and procedures.13 Achievin g effective disinfection and sterilization is essential for ensuring that medical and surgical equipment/devices do not transmit infectious pathogens to clients/patients/residents or staff . Effective reprocessing of medical equipment/devices is a process c omprised of many components (Figure 1) . Figure 1: Components of an Effective Equipment Reprocessing Program Trained Staff Centralized Reprocessing Components Required for Effective Reprocessing Quality Monitoring Written Policies and Procedures Contingencies for Equipment Failures Point -of-Use Observation Equipment Purchase Best Practices for Cleaning, Disinfection and Sterilization in All Health Care Settings | May 2013 11 It is the shared responsibility of each person involved with each surgical instrument or piece of medical equipment throughout the process of care to ensure that effective reprocessing will take place. Prior to purchase, the way that a device will be repro cessed must be taken into consideration. Reprocessing must be carried out in a centralized area (medical device reprocessing centre - MDRC) by trained staff, with monitoring and quality control parameters built into the process. Contaminated equipment/devi ces must be cleaned and then disinfected or sterilized according to defined procedures that are based on accepted standards and best practices. In the event of equipment failures or emergency situations, there are recalls and safeguards built into the syst em to protect the end user. Finally, there should be observations at point -of-use to ensure sterilization indicators demonstrate that effective sterilization has occurred. All of these components must be in place to achieve success. 1. General Principles All reprocessing of medical equipment/devices, regardless of source, must meet this guideline whether the equipment/device is purchased, loaned, physician/practitioner -owned, used for research or obtained by any other means, and regardless of where reprocessing occurs. The goals of safe reprocessing of medical equipment/devices include: preventing transmission of microorganisms to personnel and clients/patients/residents minimizing damage to medical equipment/devices from foreign material (e.g., blo od, body fluids, saline and medications) or inappropriate handling. \"Effective reprocessing requires rigorous compliance with recommended protocols.\" Public Health Agency of Canada Health care settings are required to establish, document and mai ntain their own policies and procedures for the reprocessing of medical devices .2 Best practices in reprocessing medical equipment/devices must include the following1, 2, 14: adequate review by all parties whenever new equipment/devices are being considered for purchase (e.g., reprocessing committee) a centralized area for reprocessing or an area that complies with th e requirements for reprocessing written policies and procedures for reprocessing each t ype of medical equipment/device training of all staff who perform reprocessing validation of cleanliness, sterility and function of th e reprocessed equipment/device continual monitoring of reprocessing pro cedures to ensure their quality a corporate strategy for dealing with singl e-use medical equipment/devices management and reporting of medical incidents management and re port ing of safety -related accidents recall of imp roperly reprocessed devices procedures to be followed in emergency situations (e.g., utilities shutdowns, compromised packaging, biological indicator (BI) testing failures) Best Practices for Cleaning, Disinfection and Sterilization in All Health Care Settings | May 2013 12 attention to environmental conditi ons that might impact on reprocessing . Decisions related to reprocessing medical equipment/devices should be made by a multi -disciplinary reprocessing committee that includes the individuals responsible for purchasing the equipment/device, reprocessing the equipment/device, maintaining the equipment/device, infection prevention and control, occupational health and safety, and the end -user of the equipment/device. It is strongly recommended that reprocessing should be performed in a centralized area that complies with the physical and human resource requirements for reprocessing. There must be a clear definition of the lines of authority and accountability with respect to reprocessing, whether done centrally or elsewhere. It is essential that an overall inventory of all reprocessing practices within the healthcare setting is done, including documentation as to where, how and by whom all equipment/devices are bein g reprocessed and whether current standards are being met, as set out in this document. All processes must continue to be audited on a regular basis (e.g., annually), with clear and known consequences attached to non -compliance. Compliance with the process es must also be audited. As new reprocessing technologies and processes become available, they must be evaluated against the same criteria as current methodologies. Verify that: the process is compatible with the equ ipment/device being reprocessed the proc ess is compatible with t he cleaning products being used environmental issues with the process have been considered (e.g., odours, toxic waste products, toxic vapours) occupational health issues with the process have been considered (e.g., is PPE or special ventilation required?) staff education and training is available (provided by the manufact urer) the facility is able to provide the required preventive maintenance the process can be monitored (e.g., there are mechanical, chemical and biologic mon itors and indicators available) disinfectant products have a Drug Identification Number (DIN) from Health Canada. Best Practices for Cleaning, Disinfection and Sterilization in All Health Care Settings | May 2013 13 2. Best Practices A. Purchasing and Assessing Medical Equipment/Devices and/or Products for Disinfection or Sterilization Processes All reprocessing of medical equipment/devices, regardless of source, must meet these best practices whether the equipment/device is purchased, loaned, physician/practitioner -owned, used for research, or equipment obtained by any other means. EQUIPMENT/DEVICE PU RCHASES The administration of the health care setting is responsible for verifying that any product used in the provision of care to clients/patients/residents is capable of being cleaned, disinfected and/or sterilized according to the most current standar ds and guidelines from the Canadian Standards Association (CSA), the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC)/Health Canada as well as these PIDAC best practices. The issuing of a purchase order is a useful point of control for ensuring that appropriate revie w of the equipment/device has taken place prior to purchase. Equipment that is used to clean, disinfect or sterilize (e.g., ultrasonic washers, pasteurizers, washer -disinfectors, automated endoscope reprocessors/AERs, sterilizers) must also meet standards established by Health Canada/PHAC, the CSA14 and the requirements of this document. If a health care setting out-sources a process t o a contractor (e.g., loaners, laundry, centralized processors), it is the health care setting's responsibility to ensure that the contractor is performing these functions to the standards required by the health care setting.2 Decision -making prior to purchasing medical equipment/devices and reprocessing equipment shall involve representatives from the departments in the health care setting that will use, reprocess and maintain the items and should include1, 14: Sterile Processing Purchasing Operating Room or other unit/depa rtment that will use the device Risk Management Infection Prevention and Contr ol Occupational Health and Safety Client /patient/resident care services Support services Physical plant/M aintenance Biomedical Engineering. Reprocessing staff, Infection Prevention and Control, Biomedical Engineering and Occupatio nal Health and Safety must make recommendations regarding the ability to achieve the appropriate level of reprocessing required for the equipment/device according to Spaulding's criteria15 (Table 1) and the suitability of the equipment/device for purchase, after reviewing: the manufacturer's directions applicable the equipment/device PIDAC best practices for cleaning, disinfection and sterilization. Best Practices for Cleaning, Disinfection and Sterilization in All Health Care Settings | May 2013 14 Prior to purchase of the equipment/ device, a procedure for reprocessing the equip ment /device that is achievable in the health care setting must be approv ed by all parties involved . If such a process cannot be defined, consideration must be given to alternate equipment/devices that can be adequately reprocessed . If there is a discrepancy between the reprocessing level recommended by the manufacturer and the intended use of the instrument by Spaulding's criteria, the higher level of disinfection/sterilization must be used . Newly purchased non -sterile critical and semicritical medical equipment/devices shall first be inspected and decontaminated according to their intended use prior to being put into circulation.14 Refer to Table 1 , 'Spaulding's Classification of Medical Equipment/Devic es and Required Level of Reprocessing ' for the level of processing that is to be used for medical equipment/devices based on the intended use of the equipment/device. If there is a discrepancy between the reprocessing level recommended by the manufacturer and the intended use of the instrument by Spaulding's criteria, the higher level of disinfection/sterilization must be used. For example, if the manufacturer recommends high -level disinfection for an item even though it enters a sterile space and would req uire sterilization by Spaulding's criteria, sterilization must be chosen. MANUFACTURER'S RECOM MENDATIONS The manufacturer's information for all medical equipment/devices and decontamination equipment must be received and maintained in a format that allows for easy access by staff carrying out the reprocessing activities.14 The manufacturer must supply the following: information about th e design of the equipment/device written and/or electronic manuals/directions for use1, 14 device -specific recommendations for disassembly, cleaning and reprocessing of equipment/device, including evidence that the device has been validated for disinfection/sterilization using the recommended process /processes1, 14 recommended detergents, enzymatic cleaners, disinfectants/sterilants and lubricants for use with the equipment/device recommended equipment/device expo sure time to chemical agents education for staff on use, cleaning and the correct repro cessing of the equipment/device limitations related to number of times the equipment/device may be reprocessed without degradation1, 14 recommendations for auditing the recommended process. A valid medical device license issued by the Therapeutic Products Directorate of Heal th Canada [http://www.mdall.ca/ ] or provided by the manufacturer must be available for all medical equipment/devices16 that are class II and higher. Failure to comply with licensing could result in litigation under the Medical Devices Regulations section of the Food and Drugs Act .17 Once the decision to use the equi pment/device is made, the following questions mus t then be addressed: Who is accountable to verify that the required protocols are written and in place, staff are adequately trained and certified, and that routine audits will occur to verify that the proce ss is safe? Who will reprocess the equipment/device? Where will the reprocessing be done? Best Practices for Cleaning, Disinfection and Sterilization in All Health Care Settings | May 2013 15 What process will be used for reprocessing? Are personnel certified to carry out this procedure (this includes training in the procedure, auditing the process, regula r re-education and re -certification)? How often will audits be performed? If there are limits to the number of times the equipment/device may be reprocessed, how is this tracked and by whom? LOANED, SHARED AND L EASED MEDICAL EQUIPM ENT/DEVICES A facility sh all not use any medical equipment/device that does not arrive in sufficient time to allow the receiving facility to follow its procedures for inventory, inspection and reprocessing. Health care facilities shall develop and maintain policies and procedures that apply to the sending, transporting, receiving, handling and processing of loaned, shared and leased medical equipment/devices,16 including endoscopes. The following should be included in the policy: in addition to the requirements in Section 2.A., equipment/devices loaned to a health care facility must be disassembled, cleaned and reprocessed by the receiving facility prior t o use in the receiving facility ideally, the equipment/device should be received by the facility's Med ical Device Reprocessing Centre (MDRC) at least 24 hours before use; loaned medical equipment/devices must include written instructions for reprocessing and staff must have received train ing in re processing the equipment/device a health care facility that uses loaned, shared and/or leased medical equipment/devices shall have a policy to cover emergencies r elated to the equipment/devices loaned equipment/devices must be tracked and logged; there must be a tracking mechanism and log book which includes: a record of the identification number of the equipment/device the owner of the equipment/device must have a system to track the equipment/device; this information should be give n to the user f or their records there must be a record of the client/patient/resident involved with the equipment/device, so that the client/patient/resident may be identified if the e quipment/device is recalled there must be documentation about the reason for using loan ed equipment and awareness of the possible consequ ences borrowed equipment/devices must be cleaned and reprocessed bef ore being returned to the owner organizations that transport loaned, shared and leased medical equipment/devices shall have written proced ures for the safe handling and transportation of medical equipment/devices, including provision for maintenance of cleanliness, sterility, separation of clean and dirty items, and safety of those doing the transport: soiled equipment/devices must be transp orted in compliance with federal and provincial regulations regarding the transport of dangerous goods: Transportation of Dangerous Goods Act,18 S.C., 1992, c.34.

Specific recommendations have been made by Heal th Canada/PHAC for the cleaning and decontamination of instruments and surfaces that have been exposed to tissues considered infective for Creutzfeldt -Jakob disease (CJD).19, 20 These instruments should not be pooled with other ins truments. Health Canada/PHAC defines a high risk patient as a patient diagnosed with CJD or a patient with an unusual, progressive neurological disease consistent with CJD (e.g., dementia with myoclonus and ataxia, etc.). High risk tissue includes brain, s pinal cord, dura mater, pituitary and eye (including optic nerve and retina).19, 21 For variant CJD, there are other tissues that are also infective (e.g., gastrointestinal, lymphatic) .22 Because of the risks associated with Creutzfeldt -Jakob disease (CJD), surgical instruments that are used on high risk neurological and eye tissue from clients/patients/residents at high risk for CJD must be quarantined after use and, if diagnosis is confirmed, be disposed of by incineration (preferable) or, alternatively, be subjected to rigorous decontamination processes as detailed in the Health Canada/Public Health Agency of Canad a infection contro l guideline, Creutzfeldt . Recommendations 1. Medical equipment/devices that cannot be cleaned and reprocessed according to the recommended standards shall not be purchased or should be designated single -use. [CSA Z314.0] 2.

[AII] B. Environmental Requirements for Reprocessing Areas PHYSICAL SPACE There must be a centralized area (MDRC) for reprocessing medical equipment/devices. In smaller settings , such as clinics or offices in the community, this refers to any segregated area where reprocessing of equipment/devices takes place, away from clients/ patients /residents and clean areas. Reprocessing performed outsi de the medical device reprocessing centre must be kept to a minimum and must be approved by the reprocessing committee or those accountable for safe reprocessing practices and must conform to the requirements for reprocessing space. The environment where cleaning/decontamination is performed must1, 2, 14: have adequate space for the cleaning process and storage of n ecessary equipment and supplies be distinctly separate from areas where clean/disinfected/sterile equipment/ devices are handled or stored have easy ac cess to hand hygiene facilities have surfaces that can be easily cleaned and disinfected have slip -proof flooring that can withstand wet mopping and hospital -grade cleaning and disinfecting products have environmental controls in accordance with requirements for reprocessing areas (e.g., temperature, ventilation, humidity) have restricted access from other areas in the setting and ensure one -way movement by staff . Decontamination work areas shall be physically separated from clean and other work areas by walls or partitions to control traffic flow and to contain contaminants generated during the stages of cleaning. Walls or partitions should be cleaned regularly and be constructed of materials that can withstand cleaning and disinfection.14 Decontamination sinks14: shall be designed and arranged to facilitate soa king, washing and rinsing of equipment/devices with minimal movement or delay between steps should be adjacent to waterproo f counter tops and a backsplash shall not have an overflow should be at a height that allows workers to use th em without bending or s training should be large enough to accommodate trays or baskets of instruments should be deep enough to allow complete immersion of larger devices and instruments so that aerosols are not generated during cleaning should be equipped with water ports for th e flushing of instruments with lumens, if appropriate. Hand hygiene facilities should be readily accessible and located in all personnel support areas and at all entrances to, and exits from, the decontamination area . Hand hygiene facilities should include : hand washing sinks with hands -free controls, soap dispensers and paper towels; and/or alcohol -based hand rub (ABHR). Best Practices for Cleaning, Disinfection and Sterilization in All Health Care Settings | May 2013 18 Refer to Appendix C, 'Recommendations for Physical Space for Reprocessing ', for details regarding reprocessing area space requirements . AIR QUALITY The Regulation respecting Control of Exposure to Biological and Chemical Agents (O. Reg. 833/90) made under the Occupational Health and Safety Act provides occupational exposure limits such as ceiling exposure value (CEV) for chemical agents (e .g., glutaraldehyde). A CEV is the maximum airborne concentration of a chemical agent to which a worker is exposed at any time. If control measures are not available during reprocessing involving a chemical agent, air sampling may be required to ensure tha t the regulated limit has not been exceeded for the chemical being used. The health care setting must h ave air changes, temperature and humidity appropriate to the process/product being used ( refer to manufacturer's recommendations for products and CSA Sta ndards). In health care settings where there are dedicated central reprocessing areas, negative pressure airflow must be maintained in soiled areas and positive pressure airflow must be maintained in clean areas and be monitored.14 Refer to Appendix C, 'Recommendations for Physical Space for Reprocessing ', for specific information regarding reprocessing area ventilation, temperature and humidity requirements . WATER QUALITY The health care setting should be aware of the quality of its water supply and develop policies to address known problems . There should be written reprocessing contingency plans in place that address loss of potable water, boil water advisories and other situations where the water supply becomes compromised. Refer to Appendix C, 'Recommendations for Physical Space for Reprocessing ', for information regarding reprocessing area water quality requirements ENVIRONMENTAL CLEANI NG IN STERILE PROCES SING DEPARTMENTS The housekeeping department should consult with the management of the sterile processing department and infection prevention and control to establish policies and procedures for environmental cleaning practices and cleaning frequency. As a minimum14: The facility shall have written environmental cleaning procedures with clearly defined responsibilities for all areas in the facility whe re decontamination is performed. All work areas, stands, tables, countertops, sinks and equipment surfaces shall be clea ned and disinfected at least daily. Floors sh all be cleaned at least daily. If a spill occurs, the affected ar ea shall be cleaned immediately. Sinks shall be cleaned each shift at a minimum a nd more frequently as necessary. Sinks used for cleaning endoscop es and respiratory equipment shall be cleaned between each use. The sequence of cleaning shall be from clean areas to soiled areas, from high areas to low areas (i.e., top of walls to floor) and from least con taminated to most contaminated. Environmental cleaning staff shall not move back and forth bet ween clean and soiled areas. Environmental cleaning equipment used in the decontamination area shall not be used in any other area. Refer to PIDAC's Best Practices for Environmental Cleaning for Prevention and Control of Infections in All Health Care Settings for guidance regarding cleaning in reprocessing areas, available at: http://www.oahp p.ca/resources/documents/pidac/Environmental%20Cleaning%20BP_ENGLISH_FINAL_2012 -07- 15.pdf .

Selection of Product and Level for Reprocessing The reprocessing level and products required for medical equipment/devices will depend on the intended use of the equipment/device and the potential risk of infection involved in the use of the equipment/device. REPROCESSING LEVEL The cl assification system developed by Spaulding15 (Table 1) divides medical equipment/devices into three categories, based on the pote ntial risk of infection involved in their use. Best Practices for Cleaning, Disinfection and Sterilization in All Health Care Settings | May 2013 25 Table 1: Spaulding's Classification of Medical Equipment/Devices and Required Level of Processing/Reprocessing Classification Definition Level of Processing/Reprocessing Examples Critical Equipment/ Device Equipment/device that enters sterile tissues , including the vascular system Cleaning followed by Sterilization Surgical instruments Implants Biopsy instruments Foot care equipment Eye and dental equipment Semicritical Equipment/ Device Equipment/device that comes in contact with non -intact skin or mucous memb ranes but do es not penetrate them Cleaning followed by High - Level Disinfection (as a minimum) Sterilization is preferred Respiratory therapy equipment Anaesthesia equipment Tonom eter Noncritical Equipme nt/ Device only intact skin and not mucous membranes, or does not directly touch the client/patient/resident Cleaning followed by Low - Level Disinfection (in some cases, cleaning alone is acceptab le) ECG machines Oximeters Bedpans, urinals, commodes REPROCESSING PRODUCT S Products used for any/all stages in reprocessing (i.e., cleaning, disinfection, sterilization) must be : appropriate to the level of reprocessing that is required for the use of the medical equipment/device approved by the committee responsible for product selection, by an individu al with reprocessing expertise and by an individual with infection prevention and control expertise . The process and products used for cleaning, disinf ection and/or sterilization of medical equipment/devices must be compatible with the equipment/devices : The c ompatibility of the equipment/device to be reprocessed with detergents, cleaning agents and disinfection/sterilization processes is determined by t he manufacturer of the equipment/device . The manufacturer must provide written information regarding the safe and appropriate reprocessing of the medical equipment/device. Refer to Appendix B, 'Reprocessing Decision Chart ', for guidance in choosing reproce ssing products and processes. Recommendations 30. Products used for any/all stages in reprocessing (i.e. , cleaning, disinfection, sterilization) shall be approved by the committee responsible for product selection, by an individu al with reprocessing expertise and by an individual with infection prevention and control expertise . [CSA Z314.0] Best Practices for Cleaning, Disinfection and Sterilization in All Health Care Settings | May 2013 26 31. The reprocessing method , level and products required for medical equipment/devices shall reflect the intended use of the equipment/device and the potential risk of infection involved in the use of the equipment/device. [CSA Z314.8] 32. Products used for decontamination shall be appropriate to the level of reprocessing that is required for the use of the medical equipment/device. [CSA Z314.8] 33. The process and products used for cleaning, disinfection and/or sterilization of medical equipment/devices shall be compatible with the equipment/devices. [CSA Z314.8] 34. All medical equipment/devices that will be purcha sed and will be reprocessed shall have written device -specific manufacturer's cleaning, decontamination, disinfection, wrapping and sterilization instruction. If disassembly or reassembly is required, detailed instructions with pictures shall be included. Staff training must be provided on these processes before the medical equipment/device is placed into circulation. [CSA Z314.8] H. Factors Affecting the Efficacy of the Reprocessing Procedure Policies and procedures for disinfection and sterilization must include statements to address factors that might affect the effectiveness of reprocessing. These procedures must be readily accessible to staff doing the reprocessing . Many factors14, 23, 29 affect the efficacy of reprocessing , particularly when chemical reprocessing is used. These factors include: Cleanliness of the surface of the equipment/device: Many chemical disinfectants/sterilants are inactivated by organic material ; cleaning must always precede decontamination. The greater the bioburden, the more difficult it is to disinfect or sterilize the equipment/device. Characteristics of equipment/device2, 14: Long, narrow lumens and channels (e.g., irrigation channels) are difficult to clean . Materials such as rubber and plasti c may require special treatment. Devices that cannot be readily dismantled (e.g., arthroscopy forceps) may be difficult to clean. Rough or porous surfaces may trap microorganisms (e.g., ridges, ribbing, grooves, articulations) . Hinges, cracks, coils, valves, joints, clamps, locks , surface pores , crevices on the equipment/device may impede successful disinfection/sterilization. Type and concentration of the product: Mix products used for disinfection and/or sterilization according to the manufacturer's recommendations in order to achieve the correct dilution ; if the concentration of the disinfectant is too low, the efficacy will be decreased ; if the concentration is too high, the risk of damage to the instrument or toxi c effects on the user increases. Dry equipment/devices after cleaning, before immersing in disinfectant , to preve nt dilution of the disinfectant .30 Discard solutions on or before expiry date ; diluted products are inherently unstable once mixed and the manufacturer's directions as to d uration of use must be followed. Use chemical test strips for all high -level liquid disinfect ants to assess their efficacy as directed by the manufacturer ; during reuse , the concentration of active ingredients may decrease as dilution of the product occurs and organic impurities accumulate .30 Best Practices for Cleaning, Disinfection and Sterilization in All Health Care Settings | May 2013 27 Use the appropriate disinfectant /sporicide for the task; infection prevention and control must appr ove disinfec tants and their application. When choosing the product/process , consider that some microorganisms are more resistant to disinfec tants/sporicides . Duration and temperature of exposure to the product: Use Spaulding's criteria (Table 1) for the level of disinfection/sterilization required for the intended use of the equipment/device . Refer to Appendix G, 'Advantages and Disadvantages of Currently Available Reprocessing Options ' for minimum exposure time to disinfectants/st erilants to achieve this level . Use manufacturer's recommendations for temperature and for exposure time required to achieve the desired level of disinfection/sterili zation . Do not exceed the manufacturer's maximum exposure time , as some chemicals may cause damage to the medical equipment/device if used for extend ed periods of time. Consult with an infection prevention and control professional where the manufacturer's recommendations for minimum exposure time conflict with those of Spaulding's criteria for the intended use . Ensure that all surfaces of the article are in direct contact with the disinfectant/sterilant . Contact time may be compromised by the complexity of the article and the ability of the disinfectant to penetrate lumens and other areas that are difficult to reach. Physical and chemical properties of the reprocessing environment: Water hardness can affect some disinfectants ( refer to Appendix C, 'Recommendations for Physical Space for Reprocessing '). Excessive humidity may compromise sterile wrappings ( refer to Appendix C, 'Recommendations for Physical Space for Reprocessing '). The pH of the solution may be an important consideration, as extremes o f acidity or alkalinity can limit growth of microorganisms or alter the activity of disinfectants and sterilants. All medical equipment/devices that will be purchased and will be reprocessed must have written device -specific manufacturer's cleaning, decont amination, disinfection, wrapping and sterilization instruction. If disassembly or reassembly is required, detailed instructions with pictures must be included. Staff training must be provided on these processes before the medical equipment/device is place d into circulation. Recommendation 35. Factors that affect the ability to effectively clean medical equipment/devices shall be considered prior to cleaning. [CSA Z314.8] Best Practices for Cleaning, Disinfection and Sterilization in All Health Care Settings | May 2013 28 I. Disassembly, Inspection and Cleaning of Reusable Medical Equipment/Devices \"Cleaning is always essential prior to disinfection or sterilization. An item that has not been cleaned cannot be assuredly disinfected or sterilized.\" Public Health Agency of Canada/Health Canada Reusable medical equipment/devices must be thoroughly clea ned before disinfection or sterilization.23 The process of cleaning physically removes contaminants from the equipment/device, rather than killing microorganisms. If an item is not cleaned, soil (e.g., blood, body fluids, dirt) can protect the microorganisms from the action of the disinfection or sterilization process maki ng it ineffective, as well as inactivat e the disinfectant or sterilant so that it does not work. Disinfectants that become overloaded with soil can become contaminated and may become a source for transmission of microorganisms. PRE-CLEANING Gross soil (e.g., faeces, sputum, blood) shall be removed immediately at point -of-use.14 If cleaning cannot be done immediately, the medical equipment/device must be submerged in tepid water and detergent or enzymatic cleaner to prevent organic matter from drying on it.1, 23, 29 Factors that affect the ability to effectively clean medical equipment/devices must be considered prior to cleaning. See Section 2.H., 'Factors Affecting the Efficacy of the Reprocessing Procedure ', for a list of factors that must be considered prior to cleaning medical equipment/devices. Policies and procedures for cleaning medical equipment/devices shall be based on the manufacturer's instructions and must be developed in consultation with Infectio n Prevention and Control, Occupational Health and Safety, Biomedical Engineering and Environmental Services .1, 14 Full PPE shall be worn for handling a nd cleaning contaminated equipment/devices ( see Section 2.E., 'Occupational Health and Safety for Reprocessing' ). Once medical equipment/devices have been received in the reprocessing area/department, they must be disassembled, sorted and soaked: Disassembly - facilitates access of the cleaning agent, disinfectant and/or sterilant to device surfaces: Equipment/devices shall be disassembled14 prior to cleaning if there is one or more removable part,29 unless other wise recommended by the manufacturer . The manufacturer's recommendations shall be followed when disassembling medical equipment/devices prior to washing. Sorting - keeps medical equipment/devices that belong to a set together and streamlines the cleaning process: Sort equipment/devices into groups of like products requiring the same processes . Segregate sharps and/or delicate equipment/devices to prevent injury to personnel and damage to the equipment/device. Soaking - prevents soil from drying on equipment/devices and makes them easier to clean: Soak equipment/device in a hospital approved instrument soaking solution . Do not use s aline as a soaking solution as it damages some medical equipment/devic es. Best Practices for Cleaning, Disinfection and Sterilization in All Health Care Settings | May 2013 29 Use detergent -based products, including those containing enzymes, as part of the soaking process . Ensure that detergents (including enzymatic cleaners ) are appropriate to the equipment/device being cleaned (products used must be approved by the equipment/device manufacturer) .14 Avoid prolonged soaking (e.g., overnight) of equipment/devices . CLEANING Cleaning may be done manually or using mechanical cleaning machines (e.g., washer -disinfector, ultrasonic washer , washer -sterilizer) after gross soil has been removed. Automated machines may increase productivity, improve cleaning effectiveness and decrease staff exposure to blood and body fluids.29 Manual cleaning may be required fo r delicate or intricate items. The equipment/device manufacturer's cleaning instructions shall be followed, including specifications for detergent type, water temperature and cleaning methods . The following procedures are included in the cleaning process: Physical Removal of Residual Organic Materials Completely submerge immersible items during the cleaning process to minimize aerosolization of microorganisms and assist in cleaning .14 Minimize the production of aerosols when cleaning non -immersible equipment/devices . Remove gross soil using t ools such as brushes and cloths . Manual Cleaning14 Clean equipment/devices that have lumens with a brush, according to the manufacturer's instructions, then manually or mechanically flush with a detergent solution and rinse . Check equipment/devices with lumens for obstructions and leakage . Manual ly clean heavily soiled equipment/devices before mechanical cleaning . Mechanical Cleaning14 Whenever possible, clean equipme nt/device s by mechanical means: Use mechanical washers in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions . Ensure that the equipment/device to be cleaned is compatible with the mechanical cleaning equipment and chemical solutions that are being used . Ultrasonic washers are strongly recommended for any semi -critical or critical medical equipment/device that has joints, crevices, lumens or other areas that are difficult to clean : The m anufacturer's instructions must be followed for use and routine cleaning and main tenance of the ultrasonic washer . Equipment/devices shall be completely immersed in the washing solution . After cleaning, equipment/devices shall be rinsed thoroughly prior to further reprocessing . The ultrasonic washing solution should be changed at least daily or more frequent ly if it becomes visibly soiled or if the manufacturer's instructions specify more frequent changes . Washer -disinfectors are strongly recommended for medical equipment/devices that can withstand mechanical cleaning, to achieve the re quired exposure for cleaning and to reduce potential risk to personnel : Washer -disinfectors must meet the requirements of the CSA . Best Practices for Cleaning, Disinfection and Sterilization in All Health Care Settings | May 2013 30 The m anufacturer's instructions must be followed for the use and routine maintenance, cleaning and calibration of the washer -disinfector . Washer -disinfectors may be used for low -level disinfection . Washer -disinfectors are not to be used for high -level disinfection . Care of Cleaning Tools Inspect brushes and other cleaning equi pment for damage after each use, and discard if necessary .14 Clean , disinfect , dry and store tools used to assist in cleaning (e.g., brushes, cloths) after each use, or else discard .14 Rinsing Rinsing following cleaning is necessary, as residual detergent may neutra lize the disinfectant: Rinse all equipment/devices thoroughly after cleaning with water to remove residues which might react with the disinfe ctant/sterilant. Perform the final rinse for equipment/devices containing lumens with commercially prepared sterile , pyrogen -free water (note: distilled water is not necessarily sterile or pyrogen -free). Drying14 Drying is an important step that pr events dilution of chemical disinfectants which may render them ineffective and prevents microbial growth: Follow the manufacturer's instructions for drying of the equipment/device. Equipment/devices may be air -dried or dried by han d with a clean, lint -free towel. Dry lumens with compressed air that has been filtered and dried . Dry stainless steel equipment/devices immediately after rinsing to prevent spotting. POST -CLEANING Once medical equipment/devices have been reprocessed, there must be a process to ensure that they can be differentiated from equipment/devices which have not been reprocessed. Sterilized items may be identified using external chemical indicators (CIs) , such as autoclave tape, which changes colour during sterilization. Equipment/devices which receive high -level disinfection should also be labelled, tagged or colour -coded to indicate that they have been reprocessed. The following procedures must be included following the cleaning process1, 14: Reassembly and Inspection Visually inspect all equipment/devices once the cleaning process has been completed and prior to terminal disinfection/sterilization to ensure cleanliness and integrity of the equipment/device (e.g. , cracks, defects, adhesive failures). Repeat the cleanin g on a ny item that is not clean. Do not reassemble equipment/device prior to disinfection/sterilization unless the equipment/device manufacturer's instructions specify reassembly at this stage in the reprocessing, in which case it shall take place in a clean area and be performed in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions . Lubrication Follow the man ufactur lubrication. requiring lubrication shall be lubricated prior to sterilization . Best Practices for Cleaning, Disinfection and Sterilization in All Health Care Settings | May 2013 31 Lubricants shall be compatible with the device and with the sterilization process . Discard lubricants on or before the expiry date o r when visibly soiled or contaminated . Wrapping Equipment/devices that are to be sterilized require wrapping prior to sterilization (except for immediate use steam sterilization ('flash sterilization' ) - see Section 2.L., 'Immediate Use Steam Sterilization '). Materials used for wrapping shall be prepared in a manner that will allow adequate air removal, steam penetration and evacuation to all surfaces. Refer to CSA Z314.3 -09, Effective Sterilization in Health Care Facilities by the Steam Process for informa tion on packaging materials, containers and methods.1 Practice audits Cleaning processes mus t be audited on a regular basis. A quality improvement process must be in place to deal with any irregularities/concerns resulting from the audit. Recommendations 36. Reusable medical equipment/devices shall be thoroughly cleaned before disinfection or sterilization. [CSA Z314.3, CSA Z314.8] 37. If cleaning cannot be done immediately, the medical equipment/device shall be kept moist in a transport container by using a product specifically intended for this use and in accordance with manufacturer's instructions . [CSA Z314.8] 38. The process for cleani ng shall include written protocols for disassembly, sorting, soaking, physical removal of organic material, rinsing, drying, physical inspection, lubrication and wrapping. [CSA Z314.8 ] 39. Audits of the cleaning process shall be done on a regular basis. [CSA Z314.0] J. Disinfection of Reusable Medical Equipment/Devices \"Failure to use disinfection products or processes appropriately has repeatedly been associated with the transmission of healthcare associated infections.\" Public Health Agency of Canada/ Health Canada Disinfection is the inactivation of disease -producing microorganisms. Disinfection does not destroy bacterial spores or prions. Disinfection of medical equipment/devices falls into two major categories - low-level disinfection and high -level disinfection. Best Practices for Cleaning, Disinfection and Sterilization in All Health Care Settings | May 2013 32 Noncritical and semicritical medical equipment/devices that are owned by the client ; re-used by that client and used only by that client in their home ; and not used for another purpose, do not require disinfection between uses, provided tha t they are adequately cleaned and stored dry between uses . See Section 2.I., 'Disassembly, Inspection and Cleaning of Reusable Medical Equipment/Devices ', for cleaning requirements prior to LOW -LEVEL DISINFECTION ( LLD) Low-level disin fection eliminates (' live') bacteria, some fungi and enveloped viruses. LLD is used for noncritical medical equipment/devices and some environmental surfaces. Low-level disinfectants include 3% hydrogen , 0.5% enhanced action formulation hydrogen perox ide, some quaternary ammonium compounds (QUATS), phenolics and diluted sodium hypochlorite (e.g. , bleach) solutions. LLD is performed after the equipment/device is thoroughly cleaned , rinsed and excess rinse water is removed . The container used for disinfe ction must be washed, rinsed and dried when the solution is changed. Refer to Appendix B, 'Reprocessing Decision Chart ', for chemical products that may be used to achieve low -level disinfection. Noncritical medical equipment/devices require decontaminat ion using a l ow-level d isinfectant (Table 1) .23, 29 HIGH -LEVEL DISINFECTION ( HLD) High -level disinfection eliminates vegetative bacteria, enveloped viruses, fung i, mycobacteria (e.g. , Tuberculosis) and non -enveloped viruses. HLD is used for semicritical medical equipment/devices . 0.2% peracetic acid, 2-7% enhanced formulation hydrogen peroxide and 0.55% ortho -phthalaldehyde (OPA). Pasteurization also achieves high -level disinfection. HLD is performed after the equipment/device is thoroughly cleaned , rinsed and excess rinse water is removed . Refer to Appendix B, 'Reprocessing Decision Chart ', and Appendix G, 'Advantages and Disadvantages of Currently Available Reprocessing Options ' for chemical products that may be used to achieve high -level disinfection. Sterilization is the preferred method of decontamination for semicritical medical equipment/devices. Semicritical medical equipment/devices require , at a minimum, h igh-level d isinfection (Table 1) .23, 29 Sterilization is the preferred method of decontamination for these devices . METHODS OF DISINFECT ION FOR SEMICRITICAL MEDICAL EQUIPMENT/DE VICES There are two major met hods of disinfection used in health care settings - liquid chemicals and pasteurization. Liquid Chemical Disinfection When selecting a disinfectant for reprocessing medical equipment/devices in the health care setting , consider14: the requirement for disinfectants to have a Drug Identification Number (DIN) from Health Canada23 efficacy for the intended use compatibility with the equipment/device and surfaces to be disinfected Best Practices for Cleaning, Disinfection and Sterilization in All Health Care Settings | May 2013 33 compatibility with deter gents, cleaning agents and disinfection and/or sterilization processes the intended end use of the equipment/devices to be disi nfected the method for monitoring the product concentration recommendations for rinsing (e.g., water quality, volume, time) safet y for use, with minimal toxic and irritating effects to/for staff9 environmental safety and biodegradability .9 The m anufacturer's recommendations for chemical disinfectants must be followed pertaining to: usage - disinfectant manufacturers must supply recommended usage for the disinfectant to ensure that it is compatible with the medical equipment/devices on which it will be used contact time (NOTE: where the manufacturer recommends a shorter contact time with a particular product than is required to achieve the desired leve l of disinfection/sterilization, an infection prevention and control professional must be consulted for advice) shelf life storage appropriate dilution required PPE . If a disinfectant manufacturer is unable to provide compatibility information specific to a piece of medical equipment/device, information may be obtained from Health Canada's drug -level disinfection requires monitoring and auditing: chemical test strips should be used to determine whether an effective concentration of active ingredients is present , despite repeated use and dilution: the frequ ency of testing should be based on how frequently the solutions are used (i.e. , test daily if used daily) ; at a minimum, test according to manufacturer's instruction chemical test strips must be checked each time a new package/bottle is opened to verify th ey are accurate, using positive (e.g. , full strength disinfectant solution) and negative (e.g. , tap water) controls; see manufacturer's recommend ations for appro priate controls test strips must not be considered a way of extending the use of a disinfectant solution beyond the expiration date a permanent record of processing shall be completed and retained according to the policy of the facility14; this record shall include, but not be limited to : the identification of the equi pment/device to be disinfected date and time of the clinical p rocedure concentration and contact time of the dis infectant used in each process results of each inspection (and, f or endoscopes, each leak test) result of each t esting of the disinfectant the name of the person completing the reprocessing. disinfection practices shall be audited on a regular basis and a quality improvement process must be in place to deal with any irregularities/co ncerns resulting from the audit prepared solutions shall not be topped up with fresh solution14 if manual disinfection is performed, the container used for disinfection shall be kept covered during use14 and washed, rinsed and dri ed w hen the solution is changed Best Practices for Cleaning, Disinfection and Sterilization in All Health Care Settings | May 2013 34 each device shall be thoroughly rinsed following chemical HLD , according to the chemical manufacturer's instructions; the quality of the rinse water (i.e., sterile , filtered or tap water) will depend on the intended use of t he device31 unless a device will be used immediately, it shall be thoroughly dried31 drying of non -critical devices may be done by air -drying or other methods .14 Pasteurization (Thermal Disinfection) Pasteurization , or thermal disinfection , is a process of hot water disinfection ( minimum 71\u00b0C /160 F for at least 30 minutes14), which is accomplished through the use of automated pasteurizers or washer disinfectors. Semicritical medical equipment/devices suitable for pasteurization include equipment for respiratory therapy and anaesthesia. Equipme nt/devices require thorough cleaning and rinsing prior to pasteurization ( see Section 2.I., 'Disassembly, Inspection and Cleaning of Reusable Medical Equipment/Devices ', for information about cleaning prior to pasteurization). Advantages of pasteurization include: no toxicity rapid disinfection cycle moderate cost of machinery and upkeep . Disadvantages of pasteurization include: may cause splash burns difficulty validating the effectiveness of the process pasteurizers and related equipment can become contam inated without a good preventive maintenance program and careful monitoring of processes . The manufacturer's instructions for installation, operation and ongoing maintenance of pasteurizing equipment must be followed to ensure that the machine does not bec ome contaminated : the process must be monitored with mechanical temperature gauges and timing mechanisms for each load, with a paper printout record ; pasteurizing equipment must have, or be retrofitted for, mechanical paper pri ntout water temperature withi n the pasteurizer should be verified weekly by manually measur ing the cycle water temperature cycle time should be verified manually and recorded daily calibration of pasteurization equipment will be performed according to the manufacturer's recommendation s daily cleaning of pasteurizing equipment is required following the manufacturer's recommendations following pasteurization, medical equipment/devices should be inspected for wear, cracks or soil : damaged equipment/devices shall be handled according to facility procedures soiled equipment/devices shall be reprocessed . Following pasteurization, medical equipment/devices shall be handled in a manner that prevents contamination. Equipment/devices shall be transported directly from the pasteurizer to a clean area for drying, assembly and packaging. Medical equipment/devices shall be thoroughly dried in a drying cabinet that is equipped with a high efficiency particulate air ( HEPA ) filter and is used exclusively for the drying of past eurized equipment/devices.14 A preventive maintenance program for drying cabinets must be implem ented and documented. Printed records of each cycle (i.e., temperature, time) shall be retained in accordance with the health care setting's requirements.14 Best Practices for Cleaning, Disinfection and Sterilization in All Health Care Settings | May 2013 35 Recommendatio ns 40. Noncritical medical equipment/devices shall be dec ontaminated using a l ow-level d isinfectant. [CSA Z314.8] 41. A semicritical device shall be sterilized if it can be safely sterilized according to manufacturer's instructions. If a semicritical device cannot be sterilized, then it shall, at a minimum, be high -level disinfected, thermally and semicritical medical equipment/devices that are owned by the client ; re-used by that client and used only by that client in their home ; and not used for another purpose, do not require disinfection between uses, provided that they are adequately cleaned and stored dry between uses . [BIII] 43. All disinfectants shall have a Dru g Identification Number (DIN) from Health Canada. [CSA Z314.8] 44. The chemical disinfectant used for disinfecting medical equipment/devices must be compatible with both the equipment/device manufacturer's instructions for disinfection and the cleaning product s involved in the reprocessing of the equipment/device. [BIII] 45. Disinfectant manufacturers must supply recommendations for the use and safe handling of the disinfectant. [BIII] 46. The process of high -level disinfection requires monitoring and auditing. If a che mical product is used, the concentration of the active ingredient(s) shall be verified and a logbook of daily concentration test results shall be maintained. [CSA Z314.8] 47. Manufacturer's instructions for installation, operation and ongoing maintenance of pa steurizing equipment shall be followed to ensure that the machine does not become contaminated. [CSA Z314.8] 48.

[CSA Z314.8] 50. A log of contents, tempera ture and time shall be maintained for each pasteurizer cycle . [CSA Z314.8] K. Sterilization of Reusable Medical Equipment/Devices Sterilization is the elimination of all disease -producing microorganisms, including spores (e.g. Clostridium and Bacillus species ) and prions . However, p rions are not susceptible to routine ly used sterilization processes . Sterilization is used on critical medical equipment/devices and, whenever possible, semicritical medical equipment/devices. The preferred method for decont amination of heat -resistant equipment/devices is dynamic air removal steam sterilization (pre -vacuum sterilizers are preferred) , rather than gravity displacement .2 The preferred method for decontamination of heat -resistant medical equipment/devices is dynamic air removal steam sterilization. For critical items that cannot withstand steam sterilization, chemical sterilization shall be used. Best Practices for Cleaning, Disinfection and Sterilization in All Health Care Settings | May 2013 36 For critical equipment/devi ces that cannot withstand heat sterilization, chemical sterilization is required. S ome examples of chemical sterilants include14, 29: hydrogen peroxide gas plasma vapo urized hydrogen peroxide ozone hydrogen peroxide/ozone combinations liquid peracetic acid 100% ethylene oxide 6% hydrogen peroxide 2% glutaraldehyde (> 10 hours) 2% enhanced action formulation hydrogen peroxide (6 hours) 7% enhanced action formulation hydrogen peroxide (20 minutes) Refer to Appendix B, 'Reprocessing Decision Chart', and Appendix G, 'Advantages and Disadvantages of Currently Available Reprocessing Options' for chemical products that may be used to achieve sterilization . STERILIZATION PROCES S Medical equipment/devices that have contact with sterile body tissues or fluids are co nsidered critical items.15 All critical medical equipment/devices must be sterilized ,1, 15, 23, 32 because microbial contamination could result in disease transmission. Critical items include surgical instruments, implants, foot care equipment, endoscopes that enter sterile cavities and spaces, colposcopy equipment, biopsy forceps and brushes, eye equipment and dental equipment. Semicritical medical equipment/devices have contact with nonintact skin or mucous membranes but do not penetrate them.15 Whenever possible, semicritic al medical equipment/devices should be sterilized. When sterilization is not possible, semicritical equipment/devices shall be cleaned, followed by high -level disinfection .14 Health care settings shall have written policies and procedures for sterilization of medical equipment/devices processes that include : sterilization processes that follow the principles of infection prevention and control as set out in Health Canada guidelines ,23 CSA standards1, 14, 32 and these PIDAC best practices manufacturer's instructions for installation, operation, cleaning and preventive maintenance of the equipment include clearly defined responsibilities1, 32 clearly defined processes for cleaning, decontamination, drying, inspection, lubrication, disassembly, wrapping, sealing and labelling1, 14, 32 a thorough evaluation of all sterilization processes before being put into service, and at regular inte rvals thereafter. NEW STERILIZERS Input from a professional with infection prevention and c ontrol expertise must be obtained prior to the purchase of a new sterilizer . There must be good communication between the health care setting and the manufacturer of the sterilizer to ensure that1, 32: manufacturers of sterilizers provide specific , written instructions on installa tion and use of their equipment storage and transportation practices maintain sterility to the point of use manufacturers of sterilizers are specific as to which medical equipment/devices can be sterilized in their machines and the recommended sterilization methods. Best Practices for Cleaning, Disinfection and Sterilization in All Health Care Settings | May 2013 37 Sterilizers must be subjected to rigorous testing and monitoring on installation and following disru ptions to their normal activity: Autoclaves must be installed according to the manufacturer's instructions .1, 32 Tabletop steam sterilizers are recommended only for office settings .33 Following installation of a new sterilizer, the sterilizer must pass at least three consecutive cycles with the appropriate challenges (i.e. , biological, chemical) placed in an empty sterilizer, as well as at least one cycle challenged with a full test load, before the sterilizer c an be put into routine service. For sterilizers of the dynamic air removal type (vacuum) , three consecutive air removal tests shall be conducted in an empty sterilizer with the air detection test pack ( e.g., Bowie -Dick) ,29 as described in the CSA's ' Effective Sterilization in Health Care Facilities by the Steam Process '1 [CSA Z314.3 -09 Clauses 12.4.3.2 to 12.4.3.4]. A sterilizer shall not be approved for use if the biological indicator (BI) yields a positive result on any of the tests .1 Sterilizers must be monitored with a test load and be fully re -qualified in the following circumstances1, 32: after major repa irs to an existing steriliz er when there has been construction, relocation or other environmental changes in the area after unexplained sterility failures after changes in steam and/or ethylene oxide supply or delivery after repairs or modification to the emission control system . For more information regarding requirements for new sterilizers, see the CSA's: Z314.0 -13, ' Medical Device Reprocessing - General Requirements '2 Z314.3 -09, ' Effective Sterilization in Health Care F acilities by the Steam Process '1 Z314.2 -09, ' Effective Sterilization in Health Care Facilities by the Ethylene Oxide Process '32 MONITORS AND INDICAT ORS Physical, biological and chemical monitoring is done to verify the effectiveness of sterilizers and the sterilizing process. Monitoring is done when a ster ilizer is first installed before it is put into general use and to assess routine performance thereafter. See Section 2.K., 'Sterilization of Reusable Medical Equipment/Devices ', for more information about routine monitoring. Performance monitoring using a ll three types of indicators/monitors must be completed in all sterilizers to ensure that effective sterilization has been achieved. All sterilizers must be tested for performance using physical, chemical and biological monitors and indicators. Physical Monitors A physical monitor is a device that monitors the physical parameters of a sterilizer, such as time, temperature and pressure that are measured during the sterilization cycle and recorded (as a printout or electronic record) on completion of each c ycle. Biological Indicators (BI) A biological i ndicator is a test system containing viable microorganisms (e.g., spore -laden strips or vials) providing a defined resistance to a specified sterilization process.1, 29 The BI is generally contained inside a Best Practices for Cleaning, Disinfection and Sterilization in All Health Care Settings | May 2013 38 process challenge device (PCD) that simulates the in -use challenges presented by packaged devices. O nce sterilized, a BI is incubated to see if the microorganism will grow, which indicat es a failure of the sterilizer. The manufacturer's instructions regarding the type of BI to be used in a particular sterilizer should be followed. The recommended test mi croorganisms generally used as BIs are: Geobacillus stearothermophilus (formerly Bacillus stearothermophilus ) spores for sterilizers that use steam, hydrogen peroxide gas plasma or peracetic acid, a s well as immediate use steam sterilizers Bacillus atropha eus (formerly Bacillus subtilis ) spores for sterilizers that use dry heat or ethylene oxide. The BI is incubated according to the manufacturer's instructions. Most BIs require up to 48 hours of incubation before the test is complete. However, rapid readout biological indicators are available that provide BI results in one hour. These indicators detect enzymes of Geobacillus stearothermophilus (the test organism for steam sterilizers) by reading a fluorescent product produced by the enzymatic breakdown of a nonfluorescent substrate.29 Studies have shown that the sensitivity of rapid -readout tests for steam sterilization (1 hour for 132C gravity sterilizers, 3 hours for 121 C gravity and 132 C vacuum sterilizers) parallels that of the conventional sterilization -specific BIs.34, 35 Refer to the CSA's Effective Sterilization in Health Care Faciliti es by the Steam Process1 [CSA Z314.3 -09 Clause 12.6.4] for more information about biological indicators for steam sterilizers. Refer to the CSA's Effective Sterilization in Health Care Facilities by the Ethylene Oxide Process32 [CSA Z314.2 -09 Clause 12.6.4] for more information about biological indicators for ethylene oxide sterilizers. Chemical indicators do not replace the need to use a biological indicator. Chemical Indicators (CI) A chemical indicator is a system that responds to a change in one or more predefined process variables with a chemical or physical change . There are six classes of chemical indicators1 (see Table 2 , 'International Classes of Steam Chemical Indicators '). Chemical indicators do not indicate that a device is sterile and do not replace the need to use a BI , but do indicate that the package has been processed through a sterilization cycle.29 Refe r to the CSA's Effective Sterilization in Health Care Facilities by the Steam Process1 [CSA Z314.3 -09 Clause 12.6.3] for more information about chemical indicators for steam sterilizers. Refe r to the CSA's Effective Sterilization in Health Care Facilities by the Ethylene Oxide Process32 [CSA Z314.2 -09 Clause 12.6.3] for more information about chemical indicators for ethylene oxide sterilizers. Best Practices for Cleaning, Disinfection and Sterilization in All Health Care Settings | May 2013 39 Table 2: International Classes of Steam Chemical Ind icators Class Definition Use Examples CLASS I: Process Indicators Indicators that differentiate s processed from non -processed items Used with individual units (e.g., packs, containers) to indicate that the item has been directly exposed to the sterilization process Usually applied to the outside of packages Respond to one or more critical process variables Indicator tapes Indicator labels Load cards CLASS II: Indicator for Use in Specific Tests Indicator for use in specific test procedures as defined in sterilizer/sterilization standards (e.g., air -detection, steam penetration) Used for equipment control to evaluate the sterilizer performance Bowie -Dick test CLASS III: Single Variable Indicator Indicator that reacts to a single critical variable in the sterilization process to indicate when a specified value has been reached (e.g., temperature at a specific location in the chamber) May be used for monitoring process control but not as useful as c lass IV or class V indicators May be used for exposure control monitoring (e.g., temperature at a specific location in the chamber) Temperature tubes CLASS IV: Multi -variable Indicator Indicator that reacts to two or more critical variables in the sterilization cycle under the conditions specified by the manufacturer May be used for process control Paper strips CLASS V: Integrating Indicator Indicator that reacts to all critical variables in the sterilization process (time, temperature, presence of steam) and has stated values that correlate to a BI at three time/temperature relationships Responds to critical variables in the same way that a BI responds Equivalent to, or exceeds, the performance requirements of BIs Used for process control May be us ed as an additional monitoring tool to release loads that do not contain implants CLASS VI: Emulating Indicator Indicator that reacts to all critical variables (time, temperature, presence of steam) for a specified sterilization cycle (e.g., 10 min., 18 min., 40 min.) Used as internal CI for process control A different Class VI emulating indicator is required for each sterilization cycle time and temperature used Cannot be used as an additional monitoring tool to release loads that do not contain implants Process Challenge D evice ( PCD ) A process challenge device (PCD) is a test device intended to provide a challenge to the sterilization process that is equal to, or greater than, the challenge posed by the most difficult item routinely processed.1 Examples Best Practices for Cleaning, Disinfection and Sterilization in All Health Care Settings | May 2013 40 include BI test packs which also contain a chemical indicator, or CI test packs which contain a Class 5 integrating indicato r or an enzyme -only indicator. During routine monitoring of sterilizers, a PCD containing the BI and/or CI is usually placed in the sterilizer. A PCD can be commercially manufactured or prepared in -house. Refer to the CSA's Effective Sterilization in Healt h Care Facilities by the Steam Process1 [CSA Z314.3 -09 Clause 12. 12] for more information about in-house preparation of PCDs . Refer t o the CSA's Effective Sterilization in Health Care Facilities by the Steam Process1 [CSA Z314.3 -09 Clause 12.2.2 ] for more information about PCDs . ROUTINE MONITORING O F STERILIZERS Routine monitoring verifies that the sterilization process is working as expected and that medical equipment/devices achieve sterility. Routine monitoring of sterilizers involves the assessment of physical parameters of the sterilizer cycle, chemical indicators and biological indicators. All monitoring must comply with the manufacturer's instructions. The following are included in routine monitoring1, 32: record and initial results of physical, chemical and biological parameters (see Section 2.K., 'Sterilization of Reusable Medical Equipment/Devices ', for more information on indicators) docume nt daily operation of the sterilizer : review physical monitoring parameters for each operation (e.g., printed or electronic records) note an y malfunction and take appropriate action to ensure that the product either has been properly treated o r is returned for reprocessing test f ilter system s for leakage validate g as sterilization units for such factors as gas concentration, temp erature, and relative humidity conduct three consecutive tests with the air detection test pack (Bowie -Dick) for sterilize rs of the dynamic air removal type monitor d ry heat sterilization with each cycle due to differences in penetration with different items. Sterilization indicators shall1, 32: be used according to the indica tor manufacturer's instructions be used only for the sterilizer type and cycle for which it was designed a nd validated be interpreted only by qualified staff who have been trained to do so not be used beyond the expiration date be stored in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. The following requirements apply to chemical monitoring1: An internal chemical indicator shall be placed inside each package, container or bundle that is undergoing sterilization in the area judged to be least accessible to steam penetration or to the sterilizing agent32, 36; this may not necessarily be at the centre of the package; the class of indicator chosen is based on the parameters being measured and the deg ree of precision that is needed. Each package or container to be sterilized shall have an externally visible Class I chemical indicator, which is examined immediately after sterilization to make sure that the item has been exposed t o the sterilization process . Best Practices for Cleaning, Disinfection and Sterilization in All Health Care Settings | May 2013 41 For dynamic air removal -type sterilizers, an air removal test with a Class II chemical indicator shall be performed every day the sterilizer is used (see Section 2.K, 'Sterilization of Reusable Medical Equipment/Devices' ). The following requirements apply to biological monitoring1: A biological indicator shall be used to test the sterilizer each day that it is used and with each type of c ycle that is used that day . A biological indicator shall be included in every load that is to be sterilized with ethylene oxide .32 A biological indicator shall be included in every load containing implantable devices .23 Items in the processed load should not be released until the results of the BI test are available; if quarantine pending BI results is not possible, evaluation of a Class 5 or 6 chemical indicator and the specific cycle physical paramet ers may be used to justify the release of routine loads . Implantable devices shall be quarantined until the results of the BI test are available . Refer to Appendix G, 'Advantages and Disadvantages of Currently Available Reprocessing Options ' for sterilizer -specific monitoring criteria ETHYLENE OXIDE (ETO) Ethylene oxide is a designated substance under the Occupational Health & Safety Act .37 Facilities that use ethylene oxide for sterilization must comply with the requirements of the designated substance regulation - ethylene oxide (O. Reg. 841/90), made under the OHSA; as well as guidelines from Environment Canada ,38 specifically: Emissions of ethylene oxide must be reduced by 99% during the sterilization cycle by installing an emission control system. Emissions of ethylene oxide must be reduced by 95% during aeration. Eliminate liquid discharge to avoid releases of ethylene oxide to the local sewer system. Test emiss ions of ethyle ne oxide annually. Report annually to Environment Canada. In order to safely operate an ethylene oxide sterilizer, the following must be included in the process32: Product -specific WHMIS documentation shall be obta ined from the manufacturer. Handling, storage and disposal of ethylene oxide cylinders and cartridges shall be in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. At the conclusion of a sterilization cycle and before the load is removed, the operator shall check the recording chart printout to ensure that required parameters have been met; if the chart or printout indicates a failure of any parameter, the operator shall follow the health care setting's applicable poli cies and procedure s.32 Medical equipment/devices sterilized with ethylene oxide shall be thoroughly aerated prior to handling or use, according to the equipment/device manufacturer's recommendations; reprocessing staff shall not interrupt the aeration cycle to retrieve items for use.32 For more information regarding sterilizing with ethy lene oxide, refer to the CSA's Effective Sterilization in Health Care Facilities by the Ethylene Oxide Process .32 Best Practices for Cleaning, Disinfection and Sterilization in All Health Care Settings | May 2013 42 Recommendations 51. Critical medical equipment/ devices shall be sterilized . [CSA Z314.8] 52. The manufacturer's instructions shall be followed for installation, operation and preventive maintenance of sterilizing equipment . [CSA Z314.8] 53. The sterilization process shall be validated and documented with written policies and procedures. [CSA Z314.0] 54. The sterilization process shall be tested, monitored with results recorded, and audited . [CSA Z314.0] 55. A biological indicator shall be used to test the sterilizer each day and for each type of cycle that it is used ; in every load sub jected to ethylene oxide sterilization ; and in every load containing implantable devices.

Steri lizers shall be subjected to rigorous testing and monitoring on installation and following disruptions to their normal activity. [CSA Z314.0] L. Immediate -Use Steam Sterilization (' Flash Sterilization ') Immediate -use steam sterilization (IUSS) shall only be used in emergency situations and shall not be used for implantable equipment/devices1, 23, 39 or on complete sets or trays of instruments.1 Sterilization is a process, not an event. Operative scheduling and lack of instrumentation do not qualify as reasons to use IUSS . Effective sterilization is impaired if all the necessary parameters of the process are not met. These include, but are not limited to, the following: Decontamination and sterilization areas must meet the requirements for processing space as noted in Appendix C, 'Recommendations for Physical Space for Reprocessing' , and shall not be located in the operative procedure room or near any potential source of c ontamination, such as sinks, hoppers, linen or trash disposal areas .1 A record is kept for each piece of equ ipment/device being subje cted to IUSS that includes the client/ patient /resident , procedure, physician/practitioner and equipment/device used .1 The client/ patient /resident record shoul d also reflect this information. Mechanical and chemical indicators are used for each sterilization cycle and are checked at the end of the cycle .2 A biological indicator is used each day the sterilizer is used.2 Sterility of instruments is maintained during removal from the sterilizer and transport to the point of use (e.g., transport in a sterile covered container).2 The load printout must be signed to verify that the required time, temperature and pressure have been achieved . Records must be retained according to the facility's policy .1 There must be a procedure for notification of the client/ patient /resident in the event of a recall (e.g. , positive biologic al indicator) . Records should be reviewed on a regular basis to correct issues relating to ove ruse of IUSS .

Best Practices for Cleaning, Disinfection and Sterilization in All Health Care Settings | May 2013 43 Recommendation 58. Immediate -use steam sterilization shall only be used in emergency situations and must never be used for implantable equipment/devices. [CSA Z314.0] M. Reprocessing Endoscopy Equipment/Devices For the purposes of this document , endoscopes will be considered to be of two types : Critical E ndoscope: Endoscopes used in the examination of critical spaces, such as joints and sterile cavities. Many of these endoscopes are rigid with no lumen. Examples of critical endoscopes are arthroscopes and laparoscopes. Critical endoscopes shall be steriliz prior to use. Semicritical Endoscope: Fibreoptic or video endoscopes used in the examination of the hollow viscera. These endoscopes generally invade only semicritical spaces, although some of their components might enter tissues or other critical spaces. Examples of semicritical endoscopes of high -level disinfecti on prior to use. Opinions differ regarding the reprocessing requirements for flexible bronchoscopes and cystoscopes. Since they are entering a sterile cavity, it is preferred that bronchoscopes and cystoscopes be sterilized; however, if the cystoscope or bronchoscope is not compatible with sterilization, high -level disinfection is the minimum requirement. Due to the complexity of their design, flexible fi breoptic and video endoscopes (' semicritical endoscopes ') require special cleaning and handling.14,40 EDUCATION AND TRAINI NG Individuals responsible for reprocessing endoscopes require training and must meet the health care setting's written endoscope processing competency requirements, which include ongoing education and training :14, 41 Staff assigned to reprocess endoscopes must receive device -specific reprocessing instructions to ensure proper cleaning and high -level disinfection or sterilization. Competency testing of personnel reprocessing endoscopes shall be performed at least annually and documented .14 Staff shall not be allowed to reprocess endoscopes until competency has been established.40 Best Practices for Cleaning, Disinfection and Sterilization in All Health Care Settings | May 2013 44 PHYSICAL SPACE The area used to reprocess endoscopes must include14, 40-42: a design that accommodates proper workflow from dirty to clean with adequate separation to minimize risk of cross -contamination adequate space for the storage and holding of soiled materials /equipment that is separate from other activities and is controlled to prohibit public contact dedicated processing room(s) for cleaning and decontaminating instruments that are physically separated from clean areas, client/patient/resident care areas and procedure rooms within processing/decontamination areas , utility sink(s) appropriate to the volume of work and method of decontamination and a separate hand washing station eye-washing facilities sufficient cleanable counter space to handle the volume of work space and utility connections for automatic endoscope reprocessor(s) (AER), if used ventilation system that will remove toxic vapours generated by, or emitted from, clea ning or disinfecting agents : The vapour concentration of the chemical disinfectant used shall not exceed allowable limits25 (e.g., 0.05 ppm for glutaraldehyde). Air-exchange equ ipment (e.g. , ventilation system, exhaust hoods) should be used to minimize the exposure of all persons to potentially toxic vapours .40 In-use disinfectant solutions must be maintained in closed, covered, labelled containers at all times . Air quality should be monitored on a scheduled bas is to ensure control of vapours. negative pressure ventilation and a minimum air -exchange rate of 10 per hour for processing/decontamination areas14 adequate space for the storage and holding of clean materials/equipment that is separate from other activities, has adequate positive pressure ventilation and is controlled to prohibit public contact CLEANING PROCEDURES Each h ealth care setting in which endoscopic procedures are performed shall have written detailed procedures for the cleaning and handling of endoscopes.14 Endoscopic cleaning shall take place immediately following completion of the clinical procedure,14 as soil residue in endoscope lumens dries rapidly, becoming very difficult to remove. Immediately following completion of the endoscopy procedure14, 41: Flush and wipe the endoscope at point -of-use with a soft lint -free cloth or endoscope sponge . Use a freshly prepared enzymatic cleaning solution. Place the endoscope and accessories in a covered, leak proof container and transport to the designated decontamination area. The following steps must be included in the c leaning procedure14, 29, 40, 41: Follow t he manufacturer's recommendations for cleaning and cleaning products. Perform leak testing after ea ch use, prior to cleaning: Verify the patency and integrity of the endoscope sheath through leak testing, performed prior to, and during, immersion of the endoscope. Perform the leak test according to the manufacturer's instructions. An endoscope that fail s the dry leak test should not undergo the immersion leak test. Best Practices for Cleaning, Disinfection and Sterilization in All Health Care Settings | May 2013 45 Soak and manual ly clean all immersible endoscope components with water and a recommended cleaning agent prior to automated or further manual disinfection or sterilization . Disconnect and disas semble e ndoscope components (e.g. , air/water and suction valves) as far as possible and completely immerse the endoscope and components in enzymatic cleaner. Flush and brush a ll channels and lumens of the endoscope while submerged to remove debris and mini mize aerosols. Ensure that b rushes used for cleaning lumens are of an appropriate size, inspected before and after use, and discarded (or cleaned, high -level disinfected and dried following use ). Consider irrigation adaptors or manifolds that may be recomm ended by the manufacturer to facilitate cleaning . Thoroughly rinse endoscope and all components with clean, fresh tap water prior to disinfection/sterilization and remove excess rinse water from channels by purging with forced air . Identify d amaged endoscopes and immediately remove from se rvice. Discard e nzymatic cleaner after each use. Discard disposable c leaning items or thoroughly clean and high -level disinfect/sterilize nondisposable items between uses. ENDOSCOPE DISINFECTI ON AND STERILIZATION Procedures for disinfection and sterilization of endoscopes must ensure that a minimum of high -level disinfection is used for all endoscopes and their accessories, excluding biopsy forceps and brushes (which require sterilization).40 The following steps must be included in the disinfection/sterilization procedure14, 29, 40, 41: Choose a disinfectant that is compatible with the endoscope. Monitor the efficacy of the disinfectant before each use with test strips available from the product manufacturer . Maintain a written log of monitoring test results. Do not use d isinfectants past their expiry date. Carefully follow the manufacturer's directions regarding the ambient temperature and exposure time for the disinfectant (e.g., 2% glutar aldehyde = 20 minutes at 20\u00b0C). Completely immerse the endoscope and endoscope components in the high -level disinfectant/ sterilant and e nsure all channels are perfused. Following disinfection, rinse the endoscope and flush the channels . It is preferable that filtered or sterile water be used .43 Depending on the intended use of the device, tap water followed by a 70 -90% alcohol rinse may be acceptable.41 High -level disinfection of cystoscopes should be followed by a sterile water rinse.29 Rinse water must be discarded after each use/cycle.43 A disposable sheath/condom placed over the endoscope during use reduce s the numbers of microorganisms on the scope but do es not eliminate the need for cleaning/disinfection/sterilization between uses .44 BIOPSY FORCEPS AND B RUSHES Because of the difficulty cleaning biopsy forceps/brushes, it is strongly recommended that disposable items be used . If e ndoscopic accessories (e.g., biopsy forceps and brushes) that break the mucosal barrier are to be reused, they must be sterilized after each use .40, 41 If reusable biopsy forceps/brushes are used , they must be meticulously cleaned prior to steriliza tion using ultrasonic cleaning. AUTOMATED ENDOSCOPE REPROCESSOR (AER) If an automated endoscope reprocessor (AER) is used, the following must be included in the procedure40, 41: Follow the manufacturer's instructions for use of the AER . Best Practices for Cleaning, Disinfection and Sterilization in All Health Care Settings | May 2013 46 Ensure that the endoscope and endoscope components to be reprocessed are compatible with the AER used . Ensure that channel connectors and caps for both the AER and the endoscope are compatible. Place b rushes and instruments used to clean the endoscope in the AER for disinfection. Do not open or stop the AER once started; if an AER cycle is interrupted, high -level disinfection cannot be assured . Routinely review Health Canada/OHA alerts and advisories and the scientific literature for reports of AER deficiencies that may lead to infection (reprocessing and i nfection prevention and control staff ). Implement and document preventive maintenance program (s) for the AER (s). DRYING AND STORAGE O F ENDOSCOPES Steps in the f inal drying of semicritical endoscopes include14, 41: initial flushing of all channels with medical or filtered air flushing all channels with 70% isopropyl alcohol to aid in the drying process second flushing of the channels with medical or filtered air14, 41 or dry ing in a HEPA -filtered drying cabinet .2 If an AER that includes a drying cycle is used, consult the AER manufacturer to determine whether the rinse with 70% isopropyl alcohol and forced air drying are required.14 Storage procedures must include the following14, 41: Remove c aps, valves and other detachable components during s torage and reassemble just before use ;40 store close to the endoscope in a manner that minimizes contamination. Store e ndoscopes that have been sterilized in their sterilization containers . Do not allow endoscopes to coil, touch the floor or bottom of the cabinet while handing, or be stored in their cases. Store semicritical endoscopes by hanging vertically in a dedicated, closed, ventilated cabinet outside of the decontamination area and procedure room.14 HEPA -filtered channel purge drying cabinets should be used for storage .2 Ensure that endoscope storage cabinets are constructed of non -porous material that can be cleaned. Clean and disinfect e ndoscop e storage cabinets at least weekly with an approved low -level disinfectant/cleaner . Colonoscopes have a maximum shelf life of 7 days, if stored dry.45 There are no recommendations regarding shelf life of other types of endoscopes. EQUIPMENT USED FOR CL EANING The water bottle and its connecting tube, used for cleaning the endoscope lens and irrigation during ERCP (endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography) procedures shall be cleaned and sterilized following manufacturer's instr uctions .14, 40, 41 Sterile water shall be used to fill the water bottle. RECORD -KEEPING An accurate, permanent record of endoscope use and reprocessing will assist in tracking endoscopes and clients/patients/residents in the event of a recall or follow -up: For each procedure, document the client/patient/resident's name and record number, the date and time of the procedure, the type of procedure, the endoscopist, and the serial number or other identifier of both the endoscope and the AER (if used) to assist in outbreak investigation.14, 40 Best Practices for Cleaning, Disinfection and Sterilization in All Health Care Settings | May 2013 47 Record the endoscope number in the client/patient/resident record.14, 40 Retain records according to the policy of the facility.14 For more information regarding reprocessin CSA's Devices , Section 13.14 PHAC's Infection Prevention and Control Guideline for Flexible Gastrointestinal Endoscopy and Flexible Bronchoscopy ,41 available at : http://www.phac -aspc.gc.ca/nois -sinp/guide/endo/index - eng.php .

[CSA Z314.8] N. Unacceptable Methods of Disinfection/Sterilization The following me thods of disinfection/sterilization are not recommended. BOILING The use of boiling water to clean instruments and utensils is not an effective means of sterilization.23 Boiling water is inadequate for the destruction of bac terial spores and some viruses. ULTRAVIOLET IRRADIAT ION The germicidal effectiveness of ultraviolet (UV) radiation is influenced by organic matter, wavelength, type of suspension, temperature, type of microorganism and UV intensity, which is affected by distance and dirty tubes.29 The application of UV light in the health care setting is limited to the destruction of airborne organisms (e.g. , ventilation ducts) or inactivation of microorganisms located on surfaces (e.g. , labora tory hoods). It is not an acceptable method of disinfection/sterilization for medical equipment/devices.23 GLASS BEAD STERILIZA TION Glass bead sterilizers use small glass beads and high temperature for brief exposure times to inactivate microorganisms.29 Glass bead sterilizers are difficult to monitor for effectiveness, have inconsistent heating resulting in cold spots, and often have trapped air which affects the sterilization process. The U .S. Food and Drug Administration has determined that a risk of infection exists with this equipment because of their potential failure to sterilize dental instruments and has required their commercial distribution cease until the device has received FDA cl earance.29, 46 Glass bead sterilization is not an acceptable method of sterilization for medical equipment/devices.23, 47 CHEMICLAVE A chemiclave is a machine that sterilizes surgical instruments by heating a chemical solution of primarily alcohol with 0.23% formaldehyde in a closed pressurized chamber for 20 minutes . Chemiclaves are occasionally used in dentistry, although steam sterilization is preferred due to the lack of penetration achieved in a chemiclave48 and an overall failure rate of almost 5%.49 If used, a chemiclave must be monitored with mechanical, chemical and biological monitors as is any other sterilizer. Formaldehyde is carcinogenic. Because of the environmental risks associated with formaldehyde, this method of sterilization is no longer considered to be accep table . If used, the process must be closely monitored ,50 local regulations for hazardous waste disposal must be followed and air sampling for toxic vapours may be indicated. Best Practices for Cleaning, Disinfection and Sterilization in All Health Care Settings | May 2013 49 MICROWAVE OVEN STERI LIZATION Microwave ovens are unrelia ble and difficult to monitor for effective sterilization. Home microwaves have been shown to inactivate bacteria, viruses, mycobacteria and some spores, however there may not be even distribution of microwave energy over the entire device.29 More research and testing are required to validate the use of microwave ovens for sterilization. The use of microwave ovens for sterilizatio n of medical equipment/devices is not currently acceptable.23, 29 Recommendations 74. The following methods are not acceptable for achieving disinfection/sterilization: [BIII] boiling ultraviolet light glass bead sterilization microwave ovens chemiclave sterilization O. Continued Monitoring and System Failures RECALLS Inadequate reprocessing includes, but is not limited to, the following situations: The load contains a positive BI .23 An incorrect reprocessing method w as used on the equipment/device . Print-outs on reprocessing equipment indicate failure to reach correct parameters (e.g., temper ature, pressure, exposure time). CI or monitor ing tape has not changed colour. There is doubt about the sterility of medical equipment/devices .1, 2 A written procedure must be established for the recall and reprocessing of improperly reprocessed medical equipment/devices .1, 2 All equipment/devices in each processed load must be recorded to enable tracking in the event of a recall. Facilities should consider implementing commercial instrument tracking systems to facilitate identification of patients in the event of a recall . The rec all procedure should include2: designation of department and staff responsible for executing the recall1 identification of the medical equipment/devices to be recalled1; if recall is due to a failed BI, the recall shall include the medical devices in the failed load as well as all other devices processed in the sterilizer since the last successfully sterilized load1 assessment of client/ patient /resident risk procedure for subsequent notification of physicians, clients/patients/residents, other facilities and/or regu latory bodies, if indicated surveillance of clients/patients/residents, if indicated quarantine of recalled items pending the results of investigation involvement of the facility's risk manager, if applicable. Best Practices for Cleaning, Disinfection and Sterilization in All Health Care Settings | May 2013 50 Health care settings shall have a process for receiving and disseminating medical device alerts and recalls originating from manufacturers or gov ernment agencies .14 Reusable medical devices that have been recalled due to a reprocessing failure shall be reprocessed prior to use. Recommendations 75. If a failed chemical indicator is found, the contents of the package shall be reprocessed before use . [CSA Z314.3] 76. A procedure shall be established for the recall of improperly reprocessed medical equipment/devices. [CSA Z314.0] 77. The recall procedure shall include assessment of client/ patient /resident risk and a procedure for subsequent notification of physicians, clients/patients/residents, other facilities and/or regulatory bodies if indicated. [CSA Z314.0] 78. Health care settings s hall have a process for receiving and disseminating medical device alerts and recalls originating from manufacturers or government agencies . [CSA Z314.0] P. Single -Use Medical Equipment/Devices Health care settings must not internally reprocess single use medical equipment/devices . Critical and semi - critical medical equipment/devices labelled as single -use must not be reprocessed and re -used unless the reprocessing is done by a licensed reprocessor.51, 52 Currently there are no licensed reprocessors in Canada. There are reprocessors in the USA licensed by the United States Food and Drug Administration (USFDA). Health care settings that wish to have their single -use medical equipment/devices reprocessed by a licensed reprocessor should ensure that the reprocessor's facilities and procedures have been certified by a regulatory authority or an accredited quality sy stem auditor to ensure the cleanliness, sterility, safety and functionality of the reprocessed equipment/devices.53 If a facility ente rs into a contract with a 3rd party reprocessor, the liability for adverse outcomes in the event of improper sterilization, or changes to equipment functionality, must be clear to both parties . In order to have single -use critical or semicritical medical e quipment/devices reprocessed by one of these facilities, there must be processes for: tracking and labelling equipment/device s recalling improperly reprocessed medical equipment/devices assuring p roof of sterility or high -level disinfection testing fo r pyr ogens maintenance of equipment/device functionality and integrity qualit y assurance and quality control reporting adverse events provision of good manufacturing procedures . Best Practices for Cleaning, Disinfection and Sterilization in All Health Care Settings | May 2013 51 Single -use medical equipment/devices are usually labelled by the manufacturer with a symbol: Whereas reusable medical equipment/devices are sold with instructions for proper cleaning and sterilization, no such instructions exist for single -use medical equipment/devices. Furthermore, manufacturers often have not provided data to determine whether the equipment/device can be thoroughly cleaned, whether the materials can withstand heat or chemical sterilization, or whether delicate mechanical and electrical components will continue to function after one or more reprocessing cycle s.51 In circumstances where the manufacturer does not approve of reuse , the facility may bear the brunt of legal responsibility in establishing when and under what conditions reuse of medical equipment/devices presents no increased risk to clients/ patients /residents and that a reasonable standard of care was adhered to in the reuse of the equipment/device. This would involve written policies, extensive testing of reprocessing protoc ols and strict adherence to quality assurance investigations. This is a detailed and expensive process and should only be undertaken if there is a compelling reason to do so. SHARPS Sharps are devices that can cause occupational injury to a worker. Some examples of sharps which cannot be safely cleaned include needles, lancets, blades and glass. Reprocessing needles is an occupational health hazard. Further, reprocessing needles is a patient safety issue as the re is no guarantee that the lumen is clean and that the reprocessing is effective. Needles must be single -use and must not be reprocessed. When purchasing sharps or devices with sharp components that cannot be safely cleaned, single -use devices or components shall be considered .1, 14 EQUIPMENT/DEVICES WI TH SMALL LUMENS Reusable equipment/devices with s mall lumens or other characteristics that make them difficult to clean effectively can put clients/patients/residents at risk, as they cannot be cleaned effectively or be adequately checked for cleanliness during reprocessing .1, 14 This includes items such as catheters, drains and fine cannulae (excluding endoscopy equipment). These items should be designated single -use and not be reprocessed and re - used , even if designated as reusable by the manufacturer . EQUIPMENT/DEVICES IN HOME HEALTH CARE Equipment/devices owned by the client that are re -used in their home must be adequately cleaned prior to reuse. Home health care agencies may consider re -using single -use semicritical medical equipment/devices for a single client in their home when reuse is safe and the cost of replacing the equipment/device is prohibitive for the client . See Section 2.I., 'Disassembly, Inspection and Cleaning of Reusable Medical Equipment ', for cleaning requirements . Best Practices for Cleaning, Disinfection and Sterilization in All Health Care Settings | May 2013 52 Recommendations 79. The health care setting must have written policies regarding single -use medical equipment/devices. [AIII] 80. Critical and semi -critical medical equipment/devices labelled as single -use must not be reprocessed and re -used unless the reprocessing is done by a licensed reprocessor. [AII] 81. Needles must be single -use and must not be reprocessed. [AI] 82. It is strongly recommended that catheters, drains and other medical equipment/devices with small lumens (excluding endoscopy equipment) be designated single -use and not be reprocessed and re - used, even if designated as reusable by the manufacturer . [AII] 83. Home health care agencies may consider re -using single -use semicritical medical equipment/devices for a single client in their home when reuse is safe and the cost of replacing the equipment/device is prohibitive for the client. [AIII] Q. Storage and Use of Reprocessed Medical Equipment/Devices The shelf life of a sterile package is event -related rather than time -related.1 Event -related shelf life is based on the concept that items that have been properly decontaminated, wrapped, sterilized, stored and handled will remain sterile indefinitely, unless the integrity of the package is compromised (i.e. , open, wet, dirty). If the integrity of the package is compromised, the item can no longer be considered to be sterile and it must be reprocessed again before use . STORAGE AREAS FOR STERILE ITEMS The storage area for sterile items should be located adjacent to the sterilization area, preferably in a separate, enclosed, limited -access area.1, 2 Requirements for this area include1, 2, 14, 23: Adequate storage space is pro vided to prevent crushing or damage to packages. Environmental controls : temperature maintained between 18 and 23 C relative humidity maintained between 30% and 60% Containers used for storage of clean equipment/devices should be moisture -resistant and cleanable (i.e. , cardboard boxes must not be used). Equipment/device s are stored in a clean, dry, dust -free area (closed shelves) ; not at floor level , on window sills, or under sinks; and are protected from debris, drains, moisture and vermin to prevent contamination. Shelving requirements: constructed of materials that are non -porous on all surfaces, non -shedding, easily cleanable, and free of burrs and sharp or rough edges top and bottom shelves shall be solid if open shelving units are used for storage of sterilized medical devices, the shelves should be at least 25 cm (10 in) off the floor, 46 cm (18 in) from the ceiling, and 50 cm (2 in) from an outside wall Equipment/devices are stored in an area where they are not subject to tampering by unauthoriz ed persons . Supplies and materials not used for reprocessing will not be stored in storage areas used for sterile items . Equipment /devices are transported in a manner that avoids contamination or damage to the equipment/device. Carts, bins and plastic tote s that are used for transportation of sterile goods shall be cleaned in accordance with health care setting policy.2 Best Practices for Cleaning, Disinfection and Sterilization in All Health Care Settings | May 2013 53 MAINTAINING STERILIT Y Health care settings must have procedures for storage and handling of c lean and sterile medical equipment/devices that include1, 23: Medical equipment/devices purchased as sterile must be used before the e xpiration date, if one is given. Stock should be rotated, so that oldest stock can be used first .2 Sterility must be maintained until used .23 Sterile packages that lose their integrity shall be re -sterilized prior to use . Equipment/devices must be handled in a manner that prevents recontamination of the item. USING STERILE EQUIPM ENT/DEVICES At point -of-use, upon opening the reprocessed medical equipment/device, a check must be made for integrity of the packaging and the equipment/device . Those performing this inspection must be provided with education that includes: validat ing results of chemical tape a nd internal monitors, if present visually inspect ing the equipment/device for discolouration or soil ; if present, the item is remove d from servic e and reprocessed check ing for defective equipment/devices and removing them from use checking for damp ness or wet ness (e.g. , high humidity) ; if presen t, reprocessing will be required reassembly of equipment/device if required. Refer to Appendix C, 'Recommendations for Physical Space for Reprocessing ' Recommendations 84. Sterility of sterile items shall be maintained unt il used. [CSA Z314.0] 85.
