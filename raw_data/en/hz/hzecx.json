Smudging is one such ce remony and includes the burning of four (4) sacred medicines: sage, tobacco, cedar and sweetgrass. The purpose of the Smudging Protocol is to affirm the right of Indigenous peoples to engage in Smudging on campus. This right is upheld by the University's \"Pr ocedure for Burning Traditional and Sacred Medicines\" which recognizes that \"the use of these Traditional and Sacred Medicines for ceremonial purposes is separate and distinct from the 'recreational' use of tobacco, and other substances, and as such is not subject to the same restrictions outlined in the Tobacco & Smoke Free University Policy\". The Smudging Protocol serves to provide information and guidance to the McMaster community in order that Indigenous-identified individuals and groups are affirmed and supported when they engage in their cultural and spiritual practices, including Smudging. WHAT IS SMUDGING? Smudging is a n Indigenous ceremony pa ssed down t hrough generations and engaged in by many First Nations people. The burning of sacred medicines creates a small plume of smoke that is used to purify the body, mind and ceremonial or personal space and to cleanse away any negative energy and emotions. Smudging is always voluntary . It is acceptable for a person to indicate that they do not want to Smudge. The person who chooses to refrain from the Smudge may stay in the room while others are Smudging or they may choose to quietly leave the room until the Smudge has been completed. 3 4 LEGAL PROTECTIONS FOR THE FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS OF INDIGENOUS PEOPLES Historically, the intent of colonial policies implemented by the Government of Canada was to 'assimilate' Indigenous peoples by forcing them off their lands, removing children from their parents and homes and placing them into residential schools. Indigenous peoples were forced to abandon their cultural and spiritual practices when these practices were outlawed. It is within this historical context that Indigenous peoples have asserted their rights. The Ontario Human Rights Code , Canadian Human Rights Act, Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms and the United Nations Declaration of the Rights of Indigenous Peoples include legal protections for the fundamental right of Indigenous peoples to freely practice their religious and spiritual traditions, and to be treated equally and with dignity. MCMASTER UNIVERSITY'S COMMITMENT McMaster University is committed to recognizing and affirming the unique and spiritual relationship that many Indigenous cultures have with Traditional and Sacred Medicines. McMaster's Commitment includes: Recognizing and supporting Indigenous ceremonial practices on campus; Ensuring each ceremonial act of Smudging, whether performed by an individual or in a group, is responded to in an informed and respectful fashion.

EDUCATION AND TRAINING The Equity and Inclusion Office is responsible for collaborating with, and taking leadership from, the Indigenous Studies Program/Indigenous Student Services in the development and delivery of education and training to communicate support for this Protocol and to provide information to the campus community.

ADHERENCE TO RELEVANT POLICIES/PROCEDURES This Protocol adheres to Universit y's policies, procedures and applicable legislation in order to create an inclusive and equitable environment for Indigenous peoples on campus. Tobacco & Smoke Free University Policy Procedure for Burning Traditional and Sacred Medicines, Environmental and Occupational Health Support Services, McMaster University Tobacco Control Act, 1994 Policy on Preventing Discrimination Based on Creed, Ontario Human Rights Commission Canadian Human Rights Act Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms United Nations Declaration of the Rights of Indigenous Peoples Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada: Calls to Action TEMPLATE FOR 'INTENT TO SMUDGE' NOTICE See below. 8 9 INTENT TO SMUDGE NOTICE A SMUDGING CEREMONY will be takin g place in this area today from: [start time] to [end time] Smudging is a ceremony practiced by many Indigenous peoples that involves the burning of one or more of the Sacred Medicines (tobacco, sage, cedar, sweetgrass) in order to purify a space and/or to release negative thoughts, emotions and energy. Some research has shown that Smudging reduces the levels of bacteria in a room. You may notice a slight scent or a small plume of smoke during this time. This is to be expected when Sacred Medicines are lit. McMaster University affirms the rights of Indigenous peoples to participate in Smudging. This right is upheld by the University's \" Procedure for Burning Traditional and Sacred Medicines\" which recognizes that \"the use of these Traditional and Sacred Medicines for ceremonial purposes is separate and distinct from the 'recreational' use of tobacco, and other substances, and as such is not subject to the same restrictions outlined in the \"Smoke Fre e Campus Policy\". 9With gratitude to members of the Indigenous Education Council, Indigenous Studies Program and Indigenous Student Services for their guidance. Thank you, also, to members of the Indigenous community, on and off campus, who attended the various focus groups facilitated by Katelyn Knott, Indigenous Projects Facilitator, and who offered their invaluable insights and support.
