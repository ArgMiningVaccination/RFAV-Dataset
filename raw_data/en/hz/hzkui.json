This unique technology that bridges the gap between EM and Light Microscopy (LM) will be a real game changer for cell biology research. Leuven Platform The VIB Bio Imaging Core and the departmental core of the Center for the Biology of Disease, LiMoNe, are aiming to foster collaborations and connect people to concatenate their expertise, to provide cutting edge microscopy services and develop novel schemes for analyzing and interpreting the obtained images.
