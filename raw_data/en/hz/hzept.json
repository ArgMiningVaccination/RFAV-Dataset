It has been developed by a working group of Integrated care programme (ICP) Community Dietitians for Diabetes in Primary Care, with many new topics added to meet the Dietitian role in diabetes care. The HSE Model of Integrated care for people with type 2 diabetes (2018) outlines current recommendations of care and relevant information has been integr ated into this document. The guidelines are presented in the context of the Nutrition Care Process 'Nutrition Assessment Structure Checklist' supported with Evidence on relevant topics presented in Appendices. supported with Support folders which contain additional information referred to in the Appendices. Available on the DSME shared drives . summarised in a separate Summary document to share high level updates since 2013. The guidelines and further information provided (i.e. website addresses, contact details ) are correct as of January 2020 . Please inform the working group of any amendment required. Advice re website addresses : The HSE Communications team is in the process of updating all HSE website information during 2 020. Please inform the working group of any changes observed. Resources and educational aids to assist delivery of services are being updated in phase 2 of this project. A major development in the delivery of diabetes care to peopl e with diabetes, since 2013 guidelines , is the use of language when describing people (not diabetics) and their experience with their care (no longer referring to adherence/compliance). See Ap pendix on Language and t he supporting folder on Language for further guidance. A philosophy of care has been defined in the provision of dietetic care and diabetes education to people with diabet es and the ir families or carers (see page 3 ). The role of the person with diabetes (and their family) as leaders in their own care is now well recognised in national and international recommendations. The challenge for health care professionals is to not only keep up -to date with current treatment/management evidence but to recognise the key role and in fluence of one's interpersonal skills, attitudes to and with people, and one's language used with people and talking about people and their current care. Overview of Type 2 Diabetes Diabetes is recognised as a pre -mature cause of death and ill health. People living with diabetes are at risk of developing a number of serious and life -threatening complications, leading to an increased need for medical care, a reduced quality of life, and undue stress on families. Diabetes and its complications, if not we ll managed, can lead to frequent hospital admissions and premature death (IDF, 2019). Diabetes is associated with substantial cost burden for the person with diabetes, their families and for the economy. Additional costs for diabetes i n Ireland are estimated as approx. \u20ac89million annually, with 2/3 of costs associated with hospital admissions (O'Neill et al, 2018). With prompt and accurate diagnosis and access to appropriate care, diabetes can be managed and its complications prev ented. Furthermore , type 2 diabe tes can often be prevented and there is compelling evidence to suggest it can, in some circumstances, be reversed (IDF, 2019). The definition of Type 2 Diabetes as a chronic progressive illness is currently challenged . The understanding of type 2 diabetes, gained through the initial research and recent DIRECT study in primary care, has offered people HOPE in how they approach management and treatment. A person's role in their unique treatment plan is crucial. In Ireland, there are estimates of \u00bc million people with diabetes although there is not currently a national diabetes register. The National Clin ical Programme for Diabetes prioritised diabetes care development and a register is seen as a national requirement. The HSE Integrat ed Care Programme for the Prevention and Treatment of Chronic Disease considers diabetes services a priority. In 2009 the HSE published a Review of Diabetes Structured Education. A Clinical Specialist Dietitian (Diabetes) commenced work nationally with the national clinical programme for diabetes in 201 5. National guidelines were produced to support delivery of care by diabetes health care professionals in 2016 (2016 ICGP) and the HSE Mo del of Integrated care for patients with Type 2 Diabetes was published in 2018. Services in primary care for diabetes have expanded since 2016 with placement of community podiatrists, integrated care diabetes specialist nurses and 19 Integrated care Community Dietitian posts in 2017/2018. The HSE launched the GP cycle of care for Diabetes in 2015, supporting GMS clients to receive 2 diabetes appointments in primary care with their GP. An updated national GP contract inviting GPs to participate in the Chronic Disease Management Programme commenced in Jan 2020 for GMS/GPVC. Type 2 Diabetes is included and phase 1 addresses those over 75years . In 2020 further development of diabetes services is facilitated through Sl\u00e1 intecare. 3 PHILOSOPHY OF CARE A philosophy of care has been defined in the provision of dietetic care and diabetes education to people with diabetes and the ir families or carers (see below). A philosophy is both a viewpoint (a perspective of how things are) and a system of values (a perspective of how th ings should be), (Funnell et al 1991). Philosophy is important because it influences our professional behaviours, attitudes, satisfaction and effectiveness (Anderso n, 1987). Our philosophy of care outlines the goals and values that underpin the care we deliver & how we deliver it. A defined philosophy underpins the recommended 4 quality standards for diabetes patient education programmes or structured patient education courses (SPE) ( i.e. a structured written Curriculum, Trained educators, Quality assurance and Audit). (Diabetes UK & DH 2005, HSE 2009 ), now being referred to as Self Management Education and Support (SMES) . The underlying guiding philosophy for dietetic care for people wi th type 2 diabetes is: 1. HSE Values 2. Person Centred Care (i.e. Patient -Centred Model of Care) 3. The Empowerment Approach to Care 4. The Principles of Adult Learning (i.e. Andragogy), patient education and group facilitation 5. Theories of Behaviour Change 6. Integration of psychosocial care to address disease burden and convey hope 7. The health literacy, numeracy literacy and cultural needs of the Irish population 8. Attention to language used in diabetes care, use of recommended l anguage and awareness of impac t 9. Integration of the person & their family These elements guide what we deliver & how we deliver and enable us to articulate the value of our services (1 -1 and group) to our clients, colleagues and those unfamiliar with the role of diabetes educators and DSME . Our philosophy of care for people with/at risk of diabetes is that dietitians deliver person centred and person driven care. The dietitian has a unique relationship with their clients, respecting that the person has 98% control over their care (Anderson & Funnell, 2002 ). The dietitian invites a person's spouse, families, and carers to attend appointments and courses to create a positive support network that aims to help the person in their efforts to self -manage diabetes. 4 AIMS & OB JECTIVE S AIMS OF DIETETIC CARE : 1. To devise and deliver nutrition and dietetic care, base d on current evidence and best practice, which helps the individu al and their families/carers to mak e and maintain lifestyle changes (i.e. behaviour changes) that are best suited to their particular needs, expectations, capa bilities, preferences and value s, as recommended in the HSE Model of Integrated care for patients with Type 2 Diabetes. 2. To offer all people with type 2 diabetes access to a structure d education package where they will receive appropriate dietary and clinical care advice. People not suitable for group education should be offered one to one education with a Dietitian. 3. To facilitate people's self-management i.e. to support people with type 2 diabetes to recognise their essential and active role in their own diabetes care. 4. To collaborate with people to achieve their individual recommended health result targets , recognising that a key guiding principle of cur rent diabetes care is that one size does not fit all and all care is individualised. 5. To support delivery of integrated diabetes care to people and their families as part of a collaborative multi -disciplinary diabetes care team (e.g. GP, PN, DNS , Podiatrist, Pharmacist, etc). OBJEC TIVES OF DIETETIC CARE : To support the person being informed that type 2 diabetes is a serious BUT treatable condition and to convey HOPE that it is a condition that can be very well treated and for some reversed to a 'state of remission'. To educate the person with diabetes by providing information and advice (i.e. knowledge) , to support them gaining awareness of their current diabetes management, the recommended diet and lifestyle advice for type 2 diabetes and recommended general diabetes education. Through use of behaviour change skills and strategies (i.e. BCT training), provide the person with behavioural strategies to support their diabetes self -management . To empower the person t o apply the principles of a healthy eating plan for diabetes and CVD risk reduction. To empower the person to become more physically active , to become aware of their sedentary behaviour (sitting/lying time) and to consider reducing same to support their diabetes care and overall health care. To empower the person to achieve and maintain a healthier body weight as appropriate & be informed of evidence of supporting diabetes remission . To empower the person to develop the skills, knowledge and confidence to self-manage their diab etes. People with diabetes should receive diabetes self-managemen t educ ation when their diabetes is diagnosed and as needed thereafter with 4 time points recommended by the ADA (See Appendix on Diabetes Self -Management) . To improve the person's overall health and diabetes management through promotion of healthy lifestyle choices that would support other cardiovasc ular risk factor reduct ion (e.g. healthier body weight, improved physical activity, smoking cessation, healthy alcohol intake and stress management). Focus on behaviours, as they lead to better health results. To explore medic ine taking with the person and empower them to consider challenges and discuss with GP/pharmacist/PN /DNS further as needed . To support the person to achieve diabetes health results such as blood glucos e levels, HbA 1c levels, blood pressure readings, blood lipid levels and renal function tests (i.e. urine albumin:creatinine ratio (ACR) and eGFR ) in line with the targets recommended by their lead diabetes health care professional (e.g. GP or consultant) or national guidelines. To ensure the nutritional adequacy and bala nce of the diet (e.g. Vitamin D, prevention of anaemia, malnutrition, wound healing). To support preve ntion, delay , detection and treatment of acute and chronic complications and maintain quality of life through supporting general diabetes education (e.g. discussing annual diabetic renal screening tests, care of the feet, advice to recheck diabetes health results (i.e. repeat ACR, BP, etc.) & consider associated psychosocial needs. To addres s individual needs taking into consideration personal/cultural preferences and lifestyle, and respecting wishes and willingness to change. To support the person to recognise that caring for diabetes can be demanding sometimes and can result in times where it is difficult to cope e.g. diabetes distress, more severe diabetes burnout or indeed affect our mental health more seriously causing depr ession. To support the person to learn coping skills . To support the person to recognise and explore the role of creating a supportive environment to help maintain healthy lifestyle choices and optimal diabetes care, through the support of health care professionals, family/carers/friends and social and peer supports. These guidelines support Community Dietitians in the delivery of dietetic care and DSME to people with diabetes and their families , in line with the recommendations of HSE Model of Integrated Care for the management of people with type 2 diabetes . The care delivered and translation of this guidance into practical advice, education and support to people and their families , will be guided by the clinical judgement of the dietitian to meet the individual needs of every client and their individual circumstances. 5 Nutrition Care Process for Type 2 Diabetes - adapted nutrition assessm ent structure checklist for medical and dietetic notes Follow local Policies, Procedures and Guidelines when providing care and obtaining consent. 1.Medical Tests and Procedures New assessment: Note the date of and reason for referral, medical diagnosis : newly diagnosed or existing T2DM with +/ - CKD disease, uncomplicated/complicated for primary care only or joint primary & secondary care.

When assessing blood glucose , interpret in the context of diabetes medicine s and determine if using a blood glucose monitor, frequency of checking, timing of testing, recording of results, if they have been advised on blood glucose target levels. (See BGM and Clinical Targets Appendix) . Check p erson's awareness and knowledge of diabetes health results and if advised on individual targets. Re Older Adults and supporting women of child-bearing age with pre-pregnancy planning and pregnancy , see Appendices. Provide available results in written record such as the My Diabetes Health Result Form as part of the PLAN section 8 and use Diabetes Passport as per local hospital care pathway: Check and note renal tests completed to date (serum creatinine, eGFR calculation) and translate to CKD stage. Discuss with GP as required i.e. results suggestive of CKD and not stated in referral or shared by person with diabetes . Check and note liver function tests and note same. If a woman of child -bearing age, consider if appropriate to share targets for non -pregnant women are different to pregnant women, who will require their care reviewed by their care team to support their care during pregnancy. See Appendix pre-pregnancy planning & pregnancy. Review Assessment: Comment on relevant results as per recommended Clinical Targets e.g. elevated/decreased HbA1c since last review, declining renal function.

DIETARY RECOMMENDATIONS FOR ADULTS WITH TYPE 2 DIABETES The dietary recommendations are supported with guidance on FOOD LABELLING - see support folder on food labelling. DIET/NUTRIENT ADVICE RECOMMENDATION DIET There is no single ideal dietary distribution of calories among carbohydrates, fats, and proteins for people with diabetes; therefore, meal plans should be individualis ed while keeping total calorie and metabolic goals in mind. Emphasis should be on healt hful eating patterns containing nutrient -dense foods , with less focus on specific nutrients . (ADA, 2 019) DIETARY PATTERN A variety of eating patterns are acceptabl e for the management of type 2 d iabetes (ADA, 2019). Until the evidence surrounding comparat ive benefits of different eating patterns in specific individuals strengthens, healthcare providers should focus on the key factors that are common among the patterns: 1) emphasize non-starchy vegetables, 2) minimize added sugars and refined grains, and 3) choose whole foods over highly processed foods to the extent possible (ADA, 2019 ). Low-carbohydrate, low glycaemic index, and high - protein diets, and the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet ALL improve glycaemic control , but the effect of the Mediterranean eating pattern appears to be the greatest. Three trials of a Mediterranean eating pattern reported modest weight loss and improved glycaemic control, (ADA & EASD 2018) . See FURTHER INFORMATION BELOW on Dietary Recom mendations for further information on the components of the DASH and Mediterranean diets. ENERGY Individual energy requirements can be calculated usin g the Henry Oxford equation and taking account of Physical Activity Level or individualise based on stage of CKD as relevant (INDI, Nutrition Support reference guide 2015 ). For overweight or obese people with Type 2 Diabetes reducing energy intake to achieve weight loss should be the primary nutritional management strategy (D iabetes UK 2018). Weight loss can be attained with lifestyle programs that achieve a 500 -750 kcal/day energy deficit (ADA 2019). When provided by trained practitioners in medical care settings with close medical monitoring, short -term (3-month) interventio ns that use very -low-calorie diets (defined as <800 kcal/day) and total meal replacements (800 -1200kcal/day) may achieve greater short -term weight loss (10 -15%) than intensive behavioural lifestyle interventions that typically achieve 5% weight loss, (ADA, 2019). These interventions are not routinely offered in community settings at present. In case of obesity and weight management in older adults with diabetes, please refer to the respective recommendations in the Appendices for Obesity/weight management and Older Adults. CARBOHYDRATE General Carbohydrate Guidance for Type 2 Diabetes -The ideal proportion for macronutrients including carbohydrate is unclear . However monitoring carbohydrate intake and considering the blood glucose response to dietary carbohydrate are key to improving postprandial glucose control (ADA, 2019). No specific ideal proportion of macronutrients, including carbohydrates, is advised (Di abetes UK 2018) . -Carbohydrate intake should consist of nutrient -dense carbohydrates including vegetables, fruits, legumes, whole grains and low fat dairy products. The quality of carbohydrates selected, ideally rich in dietary fibre, vitamins and mineral s and low in added sugars, fat and salt should be addressed (ADA 2019). Avoidance of sugar -sweetened drinks and fruit juices , as well as foods with added sugars , should be advised to control glycaemia, weight and reduce cardiovascular risk and risk of NAF LD (ADA, 2019). Low carbohydrate diets for Type 2 Diabetes -Low carbohydrate diets (50 -130g) can be effective in the short term (<12months) to reduce weight, improve glycaemic control, and reduce CVD risk in T2DM (BDA 2018). More research is required to determine the long term effect of low carbohydrate diets and to agree on what amount of dietary carbohydrate constitutes a low carbohydrate diet as there is currently no agreed definition . When dietary carbohydrate is restricted there is a tendency to increase other macronutrients. Individuals adhering to a low carbohydrate diet should ensure their fat is provided from MUFA rich sources and not saturated fat . -More research is required to assess the optimum dietary patterns to ensure both good glycaemic control and to reduce cardiovascular risk. -Reducing overall carbohydrate has shown to be effective to improve glycaemia in individuals with diabetes and may be a viable option for those not meeting glycaemic targets or those requiring redu ctions in diabetes medicines. (ADA 2019). -At present , there is insufficient evidence that low carbohydrate diets are superior for weight loss in the long term and it should be recognised that people on low carbohydrate diets will requi re additional diete tic support. Because of concerns regarding the use of very low carbohydrate diets in people with CKD, disordered eating patterns and pregnant women ; ADA guidelines sugge st further research is required (ADA 2019). In addition , careful consideration will nee d to be given to diabetes medicine prescriptions when considering dietary carbohydrate reduction to reduce the risk of hypoglycaemia . More frequent monitoring 11 of blood glucose levels may be necessary initially. Liaise with GP / DNS re same as required. GLYCAEMIC INDEX Replacing high GI foods with low GI alternatives has been associated with a small but significant reduction in HbA1c levels in some studies but this reduction of 4 -6mmol/l was not seen in larger RCT trials comparing low GI and standard diet . In addition , this reduction in HbA1c was not shown to be independent of w eight loss (Diabetes UK 2018). The ADA concurs that there is no clear clinical benefit in using either GI or Glycaemic Load (GL) in clinical practice. (ADA 2019). Further informati on on the GI food lists is available -to- diabetes/enjoy -food/carbohydrates -and-diabetes/gly caemic -index -and-diabetes SUCROSE There are currently no specific sugar recommendations in diabetes management. People with T2DM should be encouraged to reduce sugar intake in line with recommendations for the general population (Diabetes UK 2018). The ADA recommend s that people with diabetes minimise intakes of refined carbohydrates and added sugars and instead focus on including carbohydrates from vegetables, legumes, fruits, dairy and whole grains (ADA 2019) . In addition , they advise against the inclu sion of sugar -sweetened drinks (including fruit juice) and processed low fat or non -fat products with added sugars. In addition , NICE recommend s that foods with added sugars that may d isplace healthier more nutrient -dense foods should be avoided (NICE 2015 ). FRUCTOSE The quality of evidence for the effects of fructose in diabetes is limited (Diabetes UK 2018). Consuming naturally occur ring fructose i.e. from fruit/ honey is not more deleterious than other forms of sugar unless intake exceeds approx. 12% . The quality of the evidence for the effects of fructose in Type 2 Diabetes is limited , with trials suggesting that the iso caloric exchange of fructose for other carbohydrate does not significantly affect glucose or in sulin levels (Diabetes UK 2018). Howeve r, there is evidence that fructose may be a fac tor in increased serum and post prandial triglyceride levels (Diabetes UK 2018). The ADA recommends that people with and a t risk of diabetes avoid sugar - sweetened beverages including fruit juices , in order to c ontrol glycaemia and weight and reduce cardiovascula r risks and risk of fatty liver (ADA 2019). FRUIT The guidelines recommend that the largest proportion of our diets should be made up of vegetables, salads and fruit (5 -7 portions per day (FSAI 2019). There is much confusion about current guidance on fruit intake for diabetes (e.g. grapes, strawberries, banana, dried fruit, fruit juices). -Educate on current recommendations for health, versus knowledge needed for diabetes e.g. awareness of carbohydrate intake from fruit portion size effects and effects of glycaemic intake and glycaemic load. -Educate on the nutritional value of fruit in t erms of fibre and micronutrients (e.g. daily Vitamin C needs). -Educate on the difference between fruit in the form of w hole fruits versus juice intake. The table below gives examples of fruit portions = 15g carbohydrate Fruit Portion Apple 1 medium (160 -175g) Apricot 3 small Banana 1 small (120g) Grapes 17 (100g) Juice 150mls Melon 1 slice Orange 1 medium Raisins 2 tbsp. YOGURTS -There is much confusion about current guidance on yogurt intake for diabetes -Educate on current recommendations for health, versus knowledge needed for diabetes e.g. awareness of carbohydrate intake, added sugars, natural sugars and artificial sweeteners -Educate on the nutritional value of yoghurt in terms of macro and micro -nutrients (e.g. daily Calcium needs). Resources: To support education on yog hurts - see Diabetes Ireland - Yoghurt smart 2016 or Diabetes UK 'Whats in who consume sugar -sweetened beverages regularly, a low-calorie or non -nutritive sweetened beverage may serve as a short -term replacement strategy and can be used (ICGP , 2016) , but overall, people are encouraged to decrease both sweetened and non -nutritive sweetened beverages and use other alternatives, with an emphasis on water intake (ADA , 2018 ). -Swapping sugar -sweetened beverages for artificially sweetened beverages such as sugar -free and low sugar or diet squashes and fizzy drinks (ICGP , 2016) is likely to be beneficial for most individuals from a weight management point of v iew (Diabetes UK, 2018). However, healthier drink options/alternatives should be actively encouraged (e.g. , milk -based drinks) as these provide additional nutritional benefits that artifici ally sweetened beverages do not (BDA , 2016) . -Sugar, sweets and sweetened beverages should be avoided (IDF , 2017 ). The consumption of sugar - sweetened drinks should be minimised in children and adults (SACN , 2015) . SWEETENERS Educate that they are non-essential yet they may have a potential role in trying to support a client in reducing their total carbohydrate intake. - The evidence -base shows that artificial sweeteners are considered safe to consume in the general population with the exception of foods for infants and you ng children and are authorised and approved for use by EFSA. From a dietetic perspective, artificial sweeteners may be included as part of a dietetic intervention though recommendation should be given on a case -by-case basis (BDA , 2016; Diabetes UK, 2018). -Consumers can safely enjoy a range of nutritive and non-nutritive sweeteners when consumed as part of a balanced, healthy diet and within acceptable daily intake levels as advised by the Scientific Committee on Food (SCF) and since 2002 by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) (INDI , 2016) . -The use of non-nutritive sweeteners (NNS) may have the potentia l to reduce overall calorie and carbohydrate intake if substituted for caloric (sugar) sweeteners and wi thout compensation by intake of additional calories from other food sources. While use of non-nutritive sweetene rs does not appear to have a significant effect on glycaemic control (D iabetes UK, 2018) . Most systematic reviews and meta -analyses show benefits for non -nutritive sweetener use in weight loss however, some research suggests an association with weight gai n. Regulatory agencies set acceptable daily intake levels (ADI) for each non -nutritive sweetener, defined as the amount that can be safely consumed over a person's lifetime (ADA , 2018). For example, ADI aspartame is 40mg/kg body weight per day (70kg) = 2800mg /day and an average of 180mg aspartame in a can of diet coke. -Regulation 1333/2008/EC states that food labels of foods containing more than 10% added polyols must state 'excessive consumption may produce laxative effects' (FSAI , 2018). -People who take insulin and eat foods containing polyols may need less insulin as not all the carbohydrate from polyols is absorbed but is still included in the total carbohydrate amount on food labels. They do not affect blood glucose and do not provide calories. Non -nutritive sweeteners (NNS) approved by the EU are Acesulfame -K, 2018). DIABETIC FOODS -Avoid food labelled -'diabetic' or suitable for diabetics' ( Diabetes UK, 2018) . -Labelling food as 'diabetic' misleads the consumer as it implies a health benefit. So called 'diabetic' foods are often energy -dense and contain similar amounts of energy and saturated fat as standard products and they have a laxative effect when consumed in large amounts and can lead to weight gain (D iabetes UK, 2018; NICE , 2015). -Polyols are the sweeteners usually added to 'diabetic foods .' Diabetic foods use can take the place of more nutritious foods in the diet and thes e products tend to be expensive (INDI , 2016; ICGP , 2016) . FIBRE People with type 2 diabetes should be encouraged to increase their fibre intake through high fibre, low glycaemic index carbohydrates including vegetables, fruits, legumes and whole grains . Fibre intake is generally inadequate and increases have been shown to benefit health. SACN (2015) identified that current fibre intake in adults is around 19g/day per day. Soluble fibre has glucose and lipid -lowering effects and insoluble cereal fibre m ainly affects bowel function. High fibre diets reduce post -prandial glucose levels and can result in a modest reduction in HbA1c. Dietary fibre has many health benefits but the impact on hyperglycaemia is limited (Diabetes UK, 2018). Fibre intake recommend ations vary from 25 -45g/day, with emphasis on whole grains (Diabetes UK, 2018; SACN 2015; European Guidelines on CVD prevention in clinical practice 2016). Food labelling & Fibre It is no longer compulsory for fibre to be listed on food labelling. Fibre v alues will only be found in the nutrition table on back -of-pack as g/100 g and/or per portion, and such declarations will be voluntary, making it more difficult to interpret a product's contribution to daily fibre needs at -a-glance (as a percentage 13 of the RI). Source of fibre : contains at least 3g of fibre per 100g or at least 1.5g of fibre per 100kcal (FSAI, 2016) . High contains at least 6g of fibre per 100g or at least 3g of fibre per 100kcal (FSAI, 2016). PROTEIN There is no single ideal intake of carbohydrates, fats and protein for people with type 2 diabetes. With regards protein, opting for lean protein sources, commonly found in vegetarian and Mediterranean diets is beneficial (ADA 2019, ADA & EASD, 2018). The Healthy Ireland HSE Food Pyramid advises 2 portions per day from the meat, poultry, fish, eggs, beans and nuts group. Regarding specific protein sources, the food pyramid recommends cho osing lean meat, poultry (without skin) and fish. Eat oily fish up to twice a week. Li mit processed salty meats such as sausages, bacon and ham (HSE Food Pyramid, Department of Health, 2016). The FSAI Healthy Eating Guidelines (2019) recommends eating vegetarian 1 -2 day per week and advises that peas, beans and lentils provide good - quality protein and are a low -fat, high -fibre alternative to meat. See Oily Fish section below for more detail. It is ESSENTIAL people w ith diabetes with Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD ) have their individual requirements calculated - see Appendix on CKD. RED MEAT & PROCESSED MEAT Red meat is a good source of some nutrients, such as protein, iron, zinc and vitamin B12. However, the overall consumption of red and processed meat should be limited (BDA, 2015). This is due to the recognised carcinogenic effects of red and processed meats (RPM) when consumed in large amounts. They found that each 50 g portion of processed meat eaten daily increased the risk of colorectal cancer by 18% and the risk of colorectal cancer could increase by 17% for every 100 g portion of red meat eaten daily (WHO 2015). Also , high red and processed meat consumption may be related to the high saturated fat in animal products, high salt levels in processed meats or to the displacement of fruit and vegetables and cereals (Scarborough et al., 2012 ). To reduce RPM intake, advise on smaller portions of red and processed meat, eating these meats less often or swapping them for alternatives (SACN, 2011). Consumption of red and processed meat is \"probably carcinogenic to humans\" and \"carcinogenic to humans\" respectively (WHO, 2015). Consumption of RPM is associated with increased cardiovascular disease risk (Diabetes UK, 2018). Guidance varies regarding how much RPM we should consume. The Irish Cancer Society recommends limiting your intake to 500g or 18oz of cooked lean red meat per week (800g/28oz of l ean raw meat). This can be split into four or five small portions over the week. While the N HS/SACN advises if you eat more than 90g of red or processed meat a day, it's recommended that you reduce your intake to 70g a day. Example of RPM portions : Ireland - Pork or lamb chop - 75g or 'Quarter pounder' beef burger - 90g or Medium Steak - 145g. (Irish Cancer Society) . The 2019 FSAI Healthy eating guidelines (technical guide for health professionals) state a meat serving is 50 -75 g (half the size of your hand) cooked lean beef, lamb, pork or mince. Sunday roast (3 thin -cut slices of roast lamb, beef or pork, each about the size of half a slice of sliced bread) - 90g; grilled 8oz beef steak - 163g ; cooked breakfast (2 standard British sausages, around 9cm long, and 2 thin -cut rashers of bacon) - ; large 130g ; 5oz rump steak - 102g ; thin slice of corned beef - 38g; a slice of black pudding - 30g; a slice of ham - 23g Education Resource : Visual aids are available to laminate and show the different fat contents of meat, poultry and fish. FAT -Evidence continues to suggest that there is not an ideal percentage of calories from carbohydrate, protein, and fat for people with diabetes (Evert et al 2019, DUK 2018, ADA 2019, EASD ADA 2018 , ESC 2019 Diabetes). -ESC 2019 Diabetes recommend nutrient d istribution should be based on an individualised assessment of current eating patterns, preferences and metabolic goals. -Recent findings suggest that any effects of fat on CVD risk factors, for prevention of CVD and metabolic goals, are likely to be derived from the type of fat rather than the amount per se (ESC 2016 CVD, DUK 2018, ADA 2019). -There is increasing evidence that it is important to consider the food sources of the nutrients rather than a sole fo cus on nutrients (like SFA) and dietary advice should focus on the overall health benefits or potential risk associated with foods that are high or low in different types of fat, as part of a whole diet approach (2015 Diabetes UK and BDA statement). -Emphasis should be on heal thful eating patterns containing nutrient -dense foods , with less focus on specific nutrients (ADA 2019, EASD ADA 2018). ADA 2019, DUK 2018 & ESC 2019 Diabetes recommend dietary patterns , specifically the Mediterranean and 14 DASH -style diets to reduce CVD r isk factors and CVD events in people with diabetes. See FURTHER INFORMATION on DIETARY RECOMMENDATIONS: Key features of the Mediterranean and DASH -style diets below. -ADA 2019 and ESC 2019 Diabetes advise people with diabetes to follow the guidelines for the general population for the recommended intakes of dietary cholesterol. SATURATED FAT (SFA) The percentage of total calories from SFA should be limited (ADA 2019, ESC 2016 CVD, ESC Dyslipidaemia 2019). People with diabetes should follow guidelines for the general population for the recommended intakes of SFA ( ADA 2019 and ESC 2019 Diabetes). See below. -The 2016 HEG rationale paper, the recent SACN 2019 report on saturated fat and health, and the cardiology guidelines ESC 2016 CVD & ESC 2019 Dylsipidameia recommend SFA to account for <10% of total energy intake . -Replace SFA with unsaturated fats (Evert et al 2019, ADA 2019, DUK 2018, ESC 2019 Dyslipidaemia, SACN 2019). -General population (Irish Guidelines) : FSAI HEG 2 019 - recommend fats, spreads and oils rich in SFA need to be limited as much as possible and recommend MUFA and PUFA fats and oils can be used sparingly to replace SFA fats and oils The BDA & Diabetes UK 2015 position statement recommends more research is needed before suggesting any major changes to the current healthy eating guidance and in the absence of evidence for either the superiority or the long -term effects of adopting high SFA diets, they should not be recommended for people with type 2 diabe tes. Monounsaturated FAT For CVD risk reduction, replace SFA with unsaturated fats (Evert et al 2019) in the context of Mediterranean and DASH -style diets (ADA 2019, DUK 2018). The recent SACN 2019 report on Saturated fat and health recommends to substitute SFA with unsaturated fat. General population (Irish Guidelines): FSAI HEG 2019 recommend MUFA and PUFA fats and oils can be used sparingly to replace SFA fats and oils. Choose limited amounts of these fats. HEG 2016 rational e paper - a healthy dietary pattern include s very small amounts of unsaturated reduced fat spreads and oils. HEG 2016 Food pyramid advise to choose MUFA or PUFA reduced -fat or light spreads and oils and to use as little as possible. Polyunsaturated FAT For CVD risk reduction, replace SFA with unsaturated fats (Evert et al 2019) in the context of Mediterranean and DASH -style diets (ADA 2019, DUK 2018 ). The recent SACN 2019 report on Saturated fat and health recommends to substitute SFA with unsaturated f at. -ESC 2019 states there is not enough data are available to make a recommendation regarding the optimal n - 3: n-6 fatty acid ratio. General population (Irish Guidelines): FSAI HEG 2019 recommend MUFA and PUFA fats and oils can be used sparingly to replace SFA fats and oils. Choose limited amounts of these fats. HEG 2016 rational e paper - a healthy dietary pattern includes very small amounts of unsaturated reduced fat spreads and oils. HEG 2016 Food pyramid advise to choose MUFA or PUFA reduced -fat o r light spreads and oils and to use as little as possible. Trans FAT Trans fats should be avoided (ADA 2019, DUK 2018, ESC Dyslipidaemia 2019, ESC 2016 CVD, ESC 2019 Diabetes). General population (Irish Guidelines): FSAI HEG 2019 advise intake of TFA should be kept as low as possible. Small amounts of TFA naturally occur in meat and dairy products. It is easy to keep intake of TFA from these sources low by simply choosing low -fat dairy and lean cuts of meat. HEG 2016 rationale paper, a healthy diet sho uld contain <1% energy intake from TFA . Plant Sterols & Stanols These are widely recognised to be effective in significantly reducing total and LDL cholesterol, in people with and without diabetes. The reductions in LDL cholesterol are also seen in people already using cholesterol - lowering statin drugs. Intakes of 2 -3 grams per day of plant sterol and stanol esters are effective in lowering total and LDL cholesterol and may be recommended. However, NICE does not recommend the use of plant sterol/stanol products for primary prevention of CVD in people with Diabetes, partly due to the lack of evidence from ha rd CVD endpoints (Diabetes UK, 2018). Based on LDL -C lowering and the absence of adverse signals, functional foods with plant sterols/stanols (at 15 least 2 g/day with the main meal ) may be considered : (i) in individuals with high cholesterol levels at intermediate or low global CV risk who do not qualify for pharmacotherapy; (ii) as an adjunct to pharmacologic therapy in high - and very high -risk individu als who fail to achieve LDL -C goals on statins or are statin -intolerant; and (iii) in adults and children (>6 years) with FH, in line with current guidance (European Society of Cardiology, 2016). Therefore, these products should be advised on a case by ca se basis , they are not suitable for children under 5 or pregnant women ( BDA, 2015). These products are more expensive to buy compared to ordinary spreads, milk and yog hurts, if these foods are chosen it is important to continue to buy healthy foods and have a diet rich in fruit and vegetables t o ensure adequate intake of fat -soluble vitamins. The sugar con tent of the various cholesterol -lowering products available to buy varies and 'no added sugar ' varieties are available. Refer to food labelling guidance ( food shopping card) available on www.irishheart.ie to aid the consumer in making healthy choices. These products may offer no additional ben efit if the persons cholesterol -lowering medicine s works in the same way on inhi biting cholesterol absorption ( e.g. as in the case with eztemibe) (BDA, 2015) . Fish & Oily Fish General population: A serving of cooked fish is 100g (2019 FSAI HEG & 2016 HEG). The 2019 FSAI HEG state that r egular monitoring of contaminants in food show that it is safe to eat fish up to two times a week. Oily fish is the best food source of long chain omega -3 fatty acids (EPA and DHA), but tends to be higher in contaminants, so enjoy it no more than once a week . If only choosing white fish, this can be eaten twice a week . Note the 20 16 HEG recommends to \"e at oily fish up to twice a week\". Toxicity: The 2019 FSAI HEG recommendation takes into account toxicity and took the 2018 EFSA dioxin report recommending lower tolerable weekly intake levels than previously stated into consideratio n. Of note: the concentration of contaminants is specific to the particular species of oily fish. The FSAI is currently in the process of developing species specific Fish Consumption Guidelines. The guidelines will provide the number of portions of fish per week, on a species specific level, which can be safely consumed by different population groups. The basis of these guidelines will be concentration data for methylmercury and dioxins and the p ortion size of fish consumed by different population groups. These two inputs will be combined to derive dietary exposure levels for each contaminant per fish species and population group. The dietary exposure levels will then be compared to the establishe d safety thresholds for these contaminants in order to derive the number of portions/week, which will be protective against the adverse effects associated with these two contaminants. Of note, SACN issued a report on fish consumption in 2004 and recommend ed women of reproductive age should aim to consume within the range of one to two portions of oily fish a week. Women past reproductive age and men should aim to consume within the range of one to four portions of oily fish a week. Population of People wi th Diabetes : People with diabetes are at increased risk of CVD . To reduce CVD risk factors and CHD events, eat 2 portions of oily fish each week (DUK 2018) . Note this is higher than what is recommended for the general population. Plant sources of n -3, alp ha-linolenic acid (ALA) , have been shown to be associated with lower risk of CVD (DUK 2018). Vegetarian sources of PUFA n -3 are found in walnuts, flax seeds, chia seeds, rapeseed oil and soya bean oil, however dietary ALA has a low conversion rate to EPA/DHA (Pan et al 2012) and is influenced by gender, genetics and diet (Burdge, jones et al 2002; Burdge & Wootten 2002; Vannice et al, 2014). Fish consumption for pregnancy and breastfeeding women (2019 FSAI HEG): Aim to eat oily fish up to once a week which provides women with omega -3 fatty acids (EPA and DHA) for baby's brain and eye development and a good source of vitamin D. White fish especially cod and haddock provides iodine for brain development. Avoid shark, marlin and swordfish. These fish c ontain mercury which affects the nervous system and developing brain of the foetus. Avoid all oysters and mussels as these may contain biotoxins which are not destroyed on cooking. Limit fresh tuna intake to once a week and tinned tuna to not more than t wo 8 oz. cans per week. Breastfeeding: eat oily fish up to once a week for vitamin D and omega -3 fatty acids. Note : the 2018 HSE \"My Pregnancy Expert advice for every step\" guidelines: recommends to eat 1 to 2 portions of oily fish each week and do not h ave more than two portions of oily fish per week because of pollutants such as dioxins. Breastfeeding: don't have more than two portions of oily fish per week. 16 Fish oil supplements -There is much confusion about current guidance on fish oil supplements, which are available over the counter (including fish oil, krill oil, cod liver oil and algal oil). These provide a range of doses and forms of omega 3. Of note cod liver oil also contains vitamin A & vitamin D. -Fish oil supplements are also available at h igh doses as a medical prescription. If someone is taking prescription dose n -3 PUFA they need to be under the care and monitored by a medical doctor. The Community Dietitian educates people on dietary strategies to increase omega -3 intake from foods as part of a healthy balanced diet. FSAI 2019 state oily fish is the best food source of long chain omega 3 fatty acids (EPA & DHA). See oily fish section above for more information. Regarding supplements: Re CVD risk: Routine use of n -3 fish oil supplements is not recommended for CVD risk reduction in Type 2 Diabetes at this time ( Evert et al 2019, ADA 2019, SIGN 2017, NICE CVD 2014, ESC 2019 Diabetes). Re Drug treatment for Hypertriglyceridaemia : -DUK 2018 states there is conflicting evidence and concerns about the potential adverse effect on lipid profile but there is some evidence of the beneficial effects for those with elevated blood triglycerides. - For your information, the recent ESC Dyslipid aemia 2019 guidelines include a new recommendation for Drug treatments of patients with hypertriglyceridaemia - \"In high -risk (or above*) patients with triglyceride levels between 1.5 -5.6 mmol/L PUFAs (icosapent ethyl 2 X2 g/day) be considered in combination with a statin\". *'Above' classifies different patients types in ESC 2019 - see guidelines for more information. Note this is a medical prescription and anyone taking a prescription of n -3 PUFAs for lowering high triglycerides need to be under the care of a GP/consultant . The GP/consultant advises on same, not the dietitian - the dietitian advises people to discuss further with the medical team . -Of note, there are currently no n -3 PUFA containing products ava ilable on the community drug scheme. These items were removed in 2012. The HSE will not reimburse for any prescription for this range of products under the primary care schemes at this time. Caution and safety: -Fish oil supplements can adversely intera ct with medicines including warfarin, aspirin, propranolol & clopidogrel and should only be taken after discussion with either your Community Pharmacist or a doctor . (See Medicine Appendix for more info). -People with diabetes should consult their doctor i f they are already taking them or before taking them. MICRONUTRIENTS Supplementation is not recommended in the management or prevention of Type 2 Diabetes (Diabetes UK, 2018; ADA, 2019). Encourage individ uals choosing supplements to discuss their needs with their Dietitian. See Pregnancy Appendix re folic acid . Encourage foods flavonoids, polyph enols, and , trace elements and other vitamin s. Consum e a variety of fruit & vegetables for vitamins and antioxidants. Intakes of who legrain bread, cereals and oily fish are sources of wa ter and fat-soluble vitamins. A Multi -vitamin supplement may be ne eded for elderly, women planning a pregnancy, vegetarians, people with coeliac disease, individuals following a n eating pattern that restricts calories or a macronutrient (ADA, 2019) . Vitamin B12 must be checked annually for those on metformin due to risk of deficiency (HSE Diabetes Mod el of Care 2018) . The FSAI Healthy Eating Guidelines (2019) advise that Vitamin D -rich foods and low -dose vitamin D supplements are the most reliable and safe sources of vitamin D. Oily fish is the best natural source and vitamin D fortified dairy product s are also available. People choosing a supplement of vitamin D should take a low -dose supplement which provides a maximum of 5 -10 g of vitamin D per day as taking very high amounts of vitamin D can be harmful. SALT/SODIUM <6g Salt (NaCl) per day as per general population. Aim for a diet high in fruits and vegetables and low -fat dairy products . Studies suggest benefits to lowering salt intake to <3g Salt (NaCl) / day in people with Type 2 Diabetes (Diabetes UK , 2018). While reducing sodium to the gener al recommendation of <2.3g/day demonstrates beneficial effects on blood pressure, further reduction warrants caution & should be considered only on an individual basis. (ADA, 2019) Reductions in salt in general in both normotensive and hypertensive individ uals are effective in lowering blood pressure. DASH style diet has been shown to decrease blood pressure i n people with Type 2 Diabetes ( Diabetes UK , 2018; ADA 2019). Food Shopping Card available on https://irishheart.ie/publications/food -shopping -card/ to aid the consumer in choosing low salt foods. People with diabetes with CKD are recommended a no added salt diet - see Appendix. 17 FURTHER INFORMATION on DIETARY RECOMMENDATIONS: Key features of the Mediterranean and DASH -style diets Decrease salt intake (<6g/day) . Eat two portions of oily fish each week . Eat more whole grains, fruit and vegetables, fish, nuts and legumes . Eat less red and processed meat, refined carbohydrate and sugar -sweetened beverages . Replace saturated fats with unsaturated fats, and limit intakes of trans fatty acids . Limit alcohol to <14 units per week (Diabetes UK, 2018). NOTE: Irish guidance on alcohol less than 17 standard drinks . (170g alcohol) per week for men and 11 standard drinks (110g alcohol) per week for women . Key reference: The ADA May 2019 report (Nutrition Therapy for Adults with Diabetes or Prediabetes: A Consensus Report) summarises different eating patterns and the potential benefits reported in Table 3 - it is a useful reference for supporting discussions with peers and people with diabetes (see Support folder on Diet).

ALCOHOL Alcohol and Type 2 Diabetes Assess alcohol consum ption and discus s current intake in the context of; the effect on diabetes and potential risks associ ated with alcohol intake and diabetes as appropriate ( risk of hypoglyc aemia, weight gain, HTN, hypert ension, hypertriglyceridaemia, history of alcohol abus e, pregnancy, medical problems - liver disease, neuropathy, panc reatitis, erect ile dysfunction. If overw eight, hypertensive or hypertriglycerid aemic - limit alcoh ol. Alcohol is high in calories and does not provide any nourishment with one standard drink containing between 100-150 calories. E.g. 3.5pts of beer = 3 slices pepperoni pizza ( https://www.askaboutalcohol.ie/health/ ). Guidance for the public may confer additional cardiovascular benefits only for those consuming a Me diterranea n style diet (Dyson et al ., 2018 ). A reduction in alcohol intake in hypertensive individuals has been shown to reduce blood pressure especially if more than 28g alcohol is cons umed daily ( Dyson et al ., 2018). If on insulin/ sulphonylureas - consume alcohol with meal containing carbohydrate to prevent hypogl ycaemia and note ther e is increased risk of hypoglycaemia with quantity of alcohol consumed. There is risk of delayed nocturnal or fasting hypoglycaemia after evening alcohol consumption. Educating people with diabetes abou t the signs, symptoms, and self - management of delayed hypoglycaemia after drinking alcohol, especially when using insulin or sulphonylureas is recommended. The importance of glucose monitoring after drinking alcohol bever ages to reduce hypoglycaemia risk should be emphasised (ADA , 2019). Provide h ypoglycaemia advice as appropriate to thos e presc ribed diabetes medicine that pose a hypo risk (see Appendix on H ypoglycaemia ). Provide c urrent advice regarding weekly low risk drinking guidelines for alcohol , choices and use of mixers. It may also be useful to discuss the amount of carbohydrate and calories in alcoholic drinks. Weekly l ow risk drinking guidelines for alcohol Moder ate use of alcohol is recommended. The Irish weekly low risk d rinking guidelines on alcohol are available on https://www2.hse.ie/wellbeing/alcohol/improve -your -health/weekly -low-risk-alcohol -guidelines.html and are based on research about the amount of alcohol that reduces the risk of harm over a person's lifetime (based on a lifetime risk of dyin g from alcohol) and that reduces the risk of injury on a single occasion of drinking. Though moderate drinking may have benefits, non -drinkers are not advised to commence taking alcohol. Weekly low risk drinking guidelines are: - less than 11 standard drinks a week for wom en and less than 17 standard for men, spread out over the course of a week , with at least 2 -3 alcohol free days . 1 standard drink (SD) = approx. 10g pure alcohol (1/2 pi nt beer, 1 pub measure spirits 3 5.5mls, 1 small glass wine 12.5% volume). Note: 1 bottle of wine (12.5%) is about 7 SDs. -2-3 alcohol free days per week to minimise tolerance and habit formation. - Not consuming more than 6 Standard Drinks on any one occasion. It is also recommended to not to excee d the upper limits - drinking more than 6 standard drinks in a single session is considered binge drinking and can seriously increase the harmful effects of drinking. It increases risk of serious health problems like cancer, liver disease and high blood pressure (https://www.askaboutalcohol.ie/faqs/ ).

BEHAVIOUR CHANGE - Supporting Behaviour Change Whilst diabetes management is in essence about maintain ing healthy lifestyle behaviours which result in improved outcomes and thus improv ed quality of life and health , it remains a challenge. It is now acknowledged that only the person with diabetes has expertise about their own diabetes and their own life . The responsibility of the health care professional is to help them to explore their own expertise, to highlight how diabetes fits into their lives and where there is an obstacle that can prevent optimal management of diabetes. People are responsible for their own s elf- management (Hendrieckx et al ., 2016) . In discussing how to support people to face life with diabetes Hendrieckx et al (2016) remind s that u nderstanding the condition facilitates the coping process an d will help people in making sense of the ir new reality. It is important for the person: - To be informed of the treatment options, the course of diabetes and the seriousness of diabetes - Know that the condition can be effectively managed and does not have to lead to complications - untreated diabetes is the leading cause of many complications but well -managed dia betes is the leading cause of nothing. - Understand that they will experience 'ups and downs' in the way they feel about diabetes. (Hendrieckx et al ., 2016) The challenge for healthcare professionals is to develop an understanding of what influences health behaviour and to acquire the necessary skills that will enable them to facilitate change (Pearson, 2014). It is recognised that the single most important factor that influences change is the practitioner comm unication skills, which can influence motivati on and change (Najvitis & Weiss, 1994; Miller & Rollick , 2013 ). As health care professionals, consideration to our philosophy of care in terms of the care we deliver and how we deliver it , is important to supporting people with diabetes w ith effective behaviour change. A philosophy of care for supporting people with type 2 diabetes and their families is summarised in the introduction of this guideline . Working in a person centred way (that takes account of the psychosocial aspects of care) , with the understanding and practice of an empowerment approach to care , is now recognised as essential in health care, particularly when supporting those with chronic diseases to self manage and change behaviours (Diabetes UK, 2018; HSE, 2018; ADA , 2019) . It is also necessary to have some understanding of a person's previous experience and how they think and feel about their situation, as this will u ltimately influence behaviour. Attitudes, beliefs, individual learning styles and the social, cultural, re ligious and economic situation will also affec t behaviour. A person's environment also influences health and ability and motivation to change (Pearson, 2014). The skills and mindset of health care professionals is recognised to influence how effective they are as behaviour change agents (Pearson, 2014). The opportunity to reflect on and develop good communication/interpersonal skills through training, self - reflection and peer support/reflection is important for health care professionals. An integrated approach to changing behaviour in dietetic practice has been presented, outlining the theories, guiding principles, communication skil ls and practitioner development (Pearson, 2014). These are summarised below: Theory addresses: 1. Models used to understand and influence behaviour, including Egan's Helping Model and the Stages of Change Model by Prochaska and DiClemente. As the complexity of human behaviour can never fully be understood, no model or approach can be complete, though they help. Michie et al . (2014) present 83 theories in the ABC of B ehaviour Change T heories that guide our understandin g and care delivery . 2. Psychological approaches, such as motivationa l interviewing, behaviour therap y and cognitive behaviour therapy. Guiding principles that motivate and guide health care professionals and influence the way they apply skills include core conditions of a helping relationship (empathy, gen uineness, acceptance), respect client autono my, client responsibility, social influence (everyone has the ability to change), collaboration, self efficacy (believe change is possible), empowerment, client centred model of care vs. medical model. Stewart (1995 ) developed the client centred model to consider the client as a person addressing: 1. Explore the disease and the illness experience 2. Understand the whole person 3. Find common ground 4. Incorporate prevention and health promotion 5. Enhance the client -practitioner relationship 6. Be realistic. Communication skills to support client care include: meeting and greeting clients and their families /carers, attending behaviour (e.g. non-verbal communication, pace, tone, minimal encouragers, verbal following ), paraphrasing, reflecting feelings, questions, summarising, how to provide information, listen and reflecting change talk. Motivational strategies to support client care include for example : OARS (Open questions, affirmations , reflecting , summari se), establishing common agendas, eliciting information o n current behaviours, understanding a typical day, exploring ambivalence /resistance (pros & cons) , importance, confidence, readiness to change, exploring barriers to change, exploring options for change, problem solving, making plans, setting goals, use of rewards, building support, self monitoring and developing self awareness, supporting lapses and setbacks. 20 Cognitive behaviour strategies to support client care includes raising awareness of unhelpful thoughts and their impact on behaviour (thoughts, feelings, actions), the role of helpful thoughts and their impact on coping and supporting helpful behav iours. In 2016 clinical guidelines were developed by a mental health team in Australia to support people with diabetes and their emotional health (Hendrieckx et al ., 2016) . These were adapted by the NHS in 2019 (see Appendix on Psychosocial care and the support folder for a copy , Hendrieckx et al ., 2016) . These guidelines highlight the importance of supp orting behaviour change through; Health care professionals considering and d eveloping communication skills Health care professionals supporting people in a ' helpful way' to face up to the dia gnosis of diabetes & support change To consider how the health literacy needs of people are supported during care delivery ( also acknowledged by the HSE ) To consider the language that is used by health care professionals that may not be helpful to supporting self -care (see Appendix on Language for more information). Guidance for helping a person make changes to fit into their life has been concisely described in the Diabetes and Emotional Health handbook (Hendrieckx et al ., 2016) When asking people to make significant changes to their lifestyle, it is important to convey a message of hope, empathy, and understanding , while being factual and informative. It is important to refrain from using threat or fear -based persuasion, particularly if the perso n is not ready to face the reality and the consequences of diabetes for their future. It is more constructive to understand why a person may not be making the changes that would be appear to be 'good' for them. Help the person to understand their own barriers in implementing optimal diabetes self -management and ways to overcome these barriers . Create a space where the person can reflect on where they are now, so they can realise their own priorities and preferences - what is it they like and don't li ke about where they are now, and what they like and don't like about where they see themselves in X years' time , if they don't make some changes. Acknowledge that other issues may have greater priority for them right now; explore the person's own ' road bl ocks' and help them to identify how important these are to them or whether they can find ways to overcome them. With all this in mind, explore what options they have for making changes that would benefit their health. Enhance the person's confidence to undertake specific behaviours. When someone is asking for help to achieve their goals, help them to reflect on their options for changing, and support them to make realistic steps. This makes it more likely that they will try and succeed. Successful compl etion of one step (e.g. walking for 30 minutes once a week) increases people's confidence in undertaking the next step (e.g. walking for 30 minutes three times a week) and so on. Work with the person to develop a realistic and individualised action plan, and to identify resources to aid change. Ensure that the actions you agree upon are relatively easy with few barriers. In the real word there are many barriers to optimal self -care which hamper individual efforts to achieve optimal outcomes or change the ir motivational focus. As a health care professional, acknowledge barriers with empathy at all times. If in doubt, over - celebrate, under -criticise and honour effort as well as outcomes (Hendrieckx et al ., 2016) NICE has highlighted the importance of behaviour change in recommendations in 2007 and in 2014 and the ADA in 2019. Supporting behaviour change is NOT about getting people to comply with or adhere to provider -selected goals. Behaviour strate gies are NOT applied to people to get them to change . Our role is not to change behaviour but to INSPIRE, INFORM, SUPPORT and FACILITATE their efforts to identify and attain their own goals (Funnell & Anderson, 2005 ). Dietitians support people and their families with making behaviour changes in both the group and 1 -1 setting. Good communication is essential in both settings and the learning for one setting is transferable to the other . Facilitation skills are required to support care delivery in the group setting. Self -reflection and peer refle ction a nd support are essential to develop ing skills for both settings.

BLOOD GLUCOSE MONITORING - Self-monitoring blood glucose (SMBG) SMBG recommendations for peop le with Type 2 Diabetes living in Ireland are based on their diabetes treatment and recommendations of their diabetes care team (e.g. GP, PN, DNS). SMBG is based on capillary blood glucose measurements. The Medicines Management programme report on Self -Monitoring of Blood Glucose (SMBG) in Type 2 Diabetes 2016 is available on www.hse.ie/yourmedicines along with Frequently Asked Questions for health care professionals and people with diabetes and in the support folder on blood glucose monitoring. Some people with Type 2 diabetes may not be required to self -test their capillary blood glucose levels. Those who are prescribed medicine for diabetes management are generally advised to self -test. The frequency of testing is dependent upon the type of medicine prescribed. Medicine s associated with hypoglycaemia require more frequent blood glucose monitoring e.g. sulphonylureas and insulin. The leaflet ' Guide to Blood Glucose (Sugar) Testing Type 2 Diabetes ' outlines when and how often testing is required. This leaflet is available to order for use with client s - order from www.healthpromotion.ie under the Healthy Eating Category and it can be viewed at https://www.healthpromotion.ie/hp -files/docs/HDP00976.pdf or in the support folder. 22 Access to blood -glucose strips for Type 2 Diabetes: As of April 1, 2016, rules about access to unlimited amounts of blood glucose strips for some people with type 2 diabetes hav e changed. The HSE National Clinical Programme for Diabe tes (NCPD) published guidance on self -testing for people with Type 2 diabetes. The Primary Care Reimbursement Service (PCSR), under the guidance of the Medicines Management Programme (MMP) and the NCPD, has updated its reimbursement arrangements for blood glucose test strips (BGTS). It is recommended to read the document 'Type 2 Diabetes Test Strips Reimbursement, Questions and Answers for Health Professionals' and 'Type 2 Diabetes Test Strips: Questions and Answers for Patients' http://www.hse.ie/eng/about/Who/clinical/natclinprog/diabetesprogramme/Bloodsugartesting/ . Available in the support folder on blood glucose monitoring. The amount of blood glucose test strips required are based on medicine prescribed , but please note while current guidance recommends that people with Type Two Diabetes treated through diet alone do not need to self -test, p eople managed through diet alone will be reim bursed for 2 boxes of test strips per annum i.e. 100 test strips/annum, see Sulphonylurea e.g. Gliclazide 100 / month Insulin therapy Unlimited Planning pregnancy Unlimited The Letter advising re: Reimbursement of Blood Glucose Test Strips (BGTS) for Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus, Prof Michael Barry National Clinical Lead, Medicines Management Programme is available at https://www.hse.ie/eng/services/publications/clinical -strategy -and-programmes/bgts -for-patients -with -type -2-diabetes that there are clinical situa tions where enhanced blood glucose monitoring may be required (e.g. acute illness, therapy changes, pregnancy) and in such cases extra reimbursement support is available via an on -line application system. Additional strips can be prescribed where necessary by contacting PCRS online services on www.pcrs.ie . This service is available to allow immediate access to additional test strips reimbursed under the co mmunity drugs schemes. The person's physician, whether in primary care or in the hospital setting, can then use this online process to increase individual person's reimbursement limits . The HSE Blood Glucose Monitoring Review Group in 2017 developed and signed off on two resource s for Health Care Professionals (available in the support folder on blood glucose monitoring). 1. Best Practice Guidelines for HCPs - when monitoring capillary blood glucose in healthcare settings; and 2. Best Practice Guidelines for HCPs - when educating pa tients and carers to self -test capillary blood glucose These Best Practice Guidelines give information on: choice of equipment, registration of device, ordering of results, units of measur ement , consumables, quality c ontrol, training Targets for target s/goals for SMB G: Please be aware of advice in your LHO area (community & acute).

Please note slight differences exist between recommendations so it is important to be aware of advice in yo ur LHO area (community & acute) /GP practice sites on post -prandial blood glucose and discuss same with the teams in your area to promote consistent evidence based advice for use with people with diabetes. 2. The importance of individual goals being set for p eople with diabetes by their GP/diabetes team must also be stressed and explained to people. Guidelines on SMBG from NICE 2015 (endorsed in the Model of Integrated Care Guidelines, 2018): 1. Do not routinely offer self -monitoring of blood glucose levels for adults with type 2 diabetes unless: the person is on insulin; or there is evidence of hypoglycaemic episodes; or the person is on oral medicine that may increase their risk of hypoglycaemia while driving or operating machinery or increasing activity level; or the person is pregnant, or is planning to become pregnant. 2. Consider short -term self -monitoring of blood glucose levels in adults with type 2 diabetes (and review treatment as necessary) when; starting treatment with oral or intravenous corticosteroids; or intercurrent illness; or to confirm suspected hypoglycaemia. 3. Be aware that adults with type 2 diabetes who have acute intercurrent illness are at risk of worsening hyperglycaemia. Review treatment as necessary. 4. If adults with type 2 diabetes are self -monitoring their blood gl ucose levels, carry out a structured assessment at least annually. The assessment should include: the person's self -monitoring skills; the quality and frequency of testing; checking that the person knows how to interpret the blood glucose results and what action to take; the impact on the person's quality of life; the continued benefit to the person; and the equipment used. ICGP, 2016 endorse the following recommendation from NICE Guidelines, 2015; NICE recommend that self -monitoring should not be considered as a stand -alone intervention, but used in conjunction with appropriate therapy as part of integrated self -care and that it should be taught if the need/purpose is cl ear and agreed with the person with diabetes. ADA, 2019 recommendation re: SMB G; SMBG is an integral component of effective therapy of people taking insulin. In recent years, CGM has emerged as a complementary method for the assessment of glucose levels. Glu cose monitoring allows people to evaluate their individual response to therapy and assess whether glycaemic targets are being safely achieved. Integrating results into diabetes management can be a useful tool for guiding medical nutrition therapy and physical activity, preventing hypog lycaemia , and adjusting medicine s (particularly prandial insulin doses). The person' s speci fic needs and goals should dictate SMBG frequency and timing or the consideration of CGM use. 24 Further In formation on Flash Glucose Monitoring - THE FREESTYLE LIBRE SYSTEM In practice the Freestyle Libre System may be prescribed by a hospital consultant to help meet the care of people with Type 2 Diabetes under special circumstance s e.g. those with severe visual impairment. Many Community Dietitians are being asked questions by people with type 2 diabetes on same. Information circulated in Ju ne 2019 by D iabetes Ireland is in the support folder on BGM. In August 2019, the RSA Medical Fitness to Drive were updated to recognise products measuring interstitial fluid and give specific guidance on sa me on page 68 - see the support folder on Hypos and Driving for a copy of these guidelines. Freestyle Libre System; The Health Technology Assessment Group prepared an Advice Note 2017/001 on the Freestyle Libre System - What is the clinical effectiveness, safety and budget impact of the Freestyle Libre System compared with current glucose monitoring methods for pe ople aged 4 years and over with diabetes mellitus who use multiple daily injections of insulin? at; https://www.hse.ie/eng/about/who/healthwellbeing/htag/publications/htag -advice -note -freestyle -libre.pdf . The advice has been produced following completion of an evidence review by the Health Technology Assessment Group (HTAG), in response to a reques t from the Primary Care Reimbursement Service (PCRS) of the Health Service Executive. It addresses target population, proposed benefits, clinical effectiveness, device safety, budget implications, conclusions and recommendations and the importance of one year evaluation . As 'no part of this advice may be used without the whole of the advice being quoted in full' it is recommended to read the advice note. Important points to note in this advice note; The sensor measures glucose levels in interstitial fluid . SMBG is still required during periods of rapidly changing glucose levels, or if hypoglycaemia or impending hypoglycaemia is reported, or the symptoms do not match the system readings. Drivers will need to continue with SMBG as there are times when confirma tion with capillary blood glucose is required. See the August 2019 RSA guidelines for guidance on Group 1 drivers and legal requirements for Group 2 drivers, to meet current driving requirements in Ireland.

CHRONIC KIDNEY DISEASE (CKD ) CKD attributed to diabetes (diabetic ki dney disease/Nephropathy), occurs in 20 -40% of people with diabetes, typically developing after a duration of 10years in those with type 1 but may be present at diagnosis in those with type 2 diabetes . The presence of CKD markedly increases cardiovasc ular risk and health care costs. CKD can progress to end -stage renal disease (ESRD) requiring dialysis or kidney transplantation (ADA, 2019). Diabetic kidney disease is usually a clinical diagnosis made based on the persistent presence of albuminuria and/or reduced eGFR in the absence of signs or symptoms of other primary causes of kidney damage . The typical presentation of diabetic kidney disease is considered to include a long -standing duration of diabetes, retinopathy, albuminuria without haematuria, and gradually progressive loss of eGFR. However , signs of CKD may be present at diagnosis or without retinopathy in Type 2 diabetes, and reduced eGFR without albuminuria has bee n frequently reported in type 2 diabetes and is becoming more common over time as the prevalence of diabetes increases in the U.S. (AD A, 2019). Dietitian support in the mana gement of CKD in the community is recommended. The INDI Renal Interest Group (RIG) have reviewed the evidence for the dietary management of chronic kidney disease and are providing the latest guidance in an online course which is available in Spring 2020. This training is strongly recommended for all Community Dietitians supporting people with type 2 diabetes . Supporting dietitian resources have been updated by RIG and are provided in the support folder on CKD for information only , as training is essential for their use: The INDI RIG (2018 ) Guide to NCP in CKD Stage 1 -3A to suppor t dieti tian care. CKD Stages and Dietary intervention - guidance produced by the INDI Renal Interest Group (RIG) in May 2018 See the Appendix on clinical targets for further guidance on current recommendations for people with type 2 diabetes. Follow local PPPGs re clients seen and access/shared care with local acute dietetic care services for renal disease. Supporting completion of Health results for assessment and monito ring CKD e.g. ACR and eGFR (see Appendix on Clinical targets & My diabetes health results form) a. Assessment - Liaison with practice staff in seeking assessment of urine albumin:creatinine ratio (ACR), serum creatinine and estimate eGFR (estimated glomerular filtration rate) in people with diabetes is recommended to assess for CKD (NICE, 2014; IC GP, 2016, Model of Integrated Care, 2018). - ACR, serum creatinine and eGFR should be measured at diagnosis of diabetes and annually (at least) thereafter ( ICGP, 2016; Model of Integra ted Care, 2018) . - To detect and identify proteinuria, use urine ACR in preference to protein:creatinine ratio (PCR), because it has greater sensitivity than PCR for low levels of proteinuria. ACR is the recommended method for pe ople with diabetes. (NICE, 2014) b. Scree ning - See Appendix on Clinical Targets for further guidance on ACR - Screening for albuminuria can be most easily performed by urinary albumin -to-creatinine ratio in a random spot urine collection. If positive result this should be confirmed by a subsequent early morning sample (NICE, 2014). IMPORTANT NOTE - (ADA, 2019 ): Exercise within 24 hours, infection, fever, congestive heart failure, marked hyperglyc aemia, menstruation, and marked hypertensio n may elevate ACR independently of kidney damage. c. Interpretation of Results - Liaison with practice staff in the interpretation/review of clinical outcomes is recom mended. d. ACR interpretation - See clinical targets section for details on inte rpretation of abnormal results - Serum creatinine interpretation - Use this informat ion to calculate eGFR. eGFR should be calculated from serum creatinine using a validated formula. See www.mdcalc.com and use the CKD -EPI or MDRD equation . e. Results - Confirmation of a diagnosis of CKD is very important and CKD must be d iagnosed by GP or diabetologist on a series of results, not once of f measurements . - People should be informed about diagnosis of renal disease by GP or diabetologist. - Community Dietitians support the diabetes care team and people with diabetes to have ACR and eGFR assessed and reviewed. - Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) recommends a comprehensive CKD staging that incorporates albuminuria at all stages of eGFR; this system is more closely associated with risk but is also more complex and does not translate direc tly to treat ment decisions (ADA, 2019). Regardless of classi fication scheme, both eGFR and albuminuria should be quanti fied to guide treatment decisions (ADA, 2019). 26 - Be aware that: o increased ACR is associated with increased risk of adverse outcomes o decreased GFR is associated with increased risk of adverse outcomes o increased ACR and decreased GFR in combination multiply the risk of adverse outcomes. (NICE, 2014) Classification of chronic kidney disease using GFR and ACR categories ( KDIGO, 2012). Explanation of CKD according to estimated -G5, which have the same GFR thresho lds as the CKD stages 1 -5 recommended previously) and 'A' for the ACR category (A1 -A3), for example: A person with an eGFR of 25 ml/min/1.73m2 and an ACR of 15 mg/mmol has CKD G4A2. A person with an eGFR of 50 ml/min/1.73m2 and an ACR of 35 mg/mmol has CKD G3aA3. eGFR of less than 15 ml/min/1.73m2 (GFR category G5) is referred to as kidney failure.

Model of integrated Care, 2018 recommend treatments to optimise; g lycaemic control; lipid contr ol; and blood pressure control ( including treatment with an ACE inhibitor or an ARB). - The Irish Nutrition and Dietetic Institute Renal Interest Group recommend that the dietary advice should depend on the stage of the renal disease, based on estimation of the eGFR, using the MDRD equation. See www.mdcalc.com and use the MDRD equation . - For people with diabetes and CKD , provide appropriate dietary advice for the mana gement of each stage. It important to classify stage 3 as 3A and 3B . o Follow guidance as advised at INDI RIG training in use of the CKD and dietary interventions guidance. o The guidance for calculation of requirements will be provided at this training in relation to the CKD stages .

It is important to individualise protein requirements . They may require at least one individual appointment . o A website has been developed for supporting Irish clients with CKD - www.irishkidneydiet.ie References INDI Renal Interest Group ADA, 2019 - American Diabetes Association - Standards of Medical Care in Diabetes; The Journal of Clinical and Applied Research and Education, Diabetes Care, January 2019.

CLINICAL TARGETS FOR ADULTS WITH TYPE 2 DIABETES The key message re clinical targets is that each individual clinical measure has a target individualised for every person with diabetes. Those who are pregnant or those planning a pregnancy and older adults will require their individual targets to be reviewed and discussed as part of their ca re. See relevant Appendices. The person will be advised 'Your diabetes team will work with you to decide what results are best for you. You may aim for hi gher or lower targets depending on your age, how long you have diabetes for and your medical history' , as listed in the 'My Diabetes Health Result Form' resource. Targets are listed below and referenced. The summary from the references are available in a table in the support folder on Clinical targets. Other supporting information is also available in this folder. CLINICAL TARGETS for NON -PREGNANT PEOPLE WITH TYPE 2 DIABETES Outcome of Care TARGET/GOAL CHECK HbA1c1,2, 53 (7%) At least 3 times a year (Glycated haemoglobin) 48 (6.5%) may be suitab le for those newly diagnosed & without significant co -morbidit ies mmol/mol (%) 58 (7.5%) or less stringent HbA1c goals may be appropriate for some individuals Blood Glucose (mmol/l)4 As recommended to meet individual treatment needs - Pre-prandial 4-7 - Post-prandial (2 hours ) < 10 Blood Pressure (mmHg)1,2 140/80 At least 3 times a year <130/80 may be appropriate for some (e.g. with HTN & high CVD risk, microvascula r disease, CKD, younger people with Type 2 Diabetes ) Total Cholesterol (mmol/l)3 <4.5 As part of annual lipid profile LDL Cholesterol (mmol/l)1,2 2.5 primary prevention + statin At least once year. 4monthly if not in target. 1.8 secondary prevention + statin HDL Cholesterol (mmol/l)1,2 1.0 Men 1.3 Women Triglycerides (mmol/l)1,2 1.7 Urine Albumin:Creatinine (ratio)1,2 <2.5 Men On diagnosis, annually or at follow -up if raised before mg/mmol < 3.5 Women eGFR1,2 >60 On diagnosis, annually or at follow -up if raised before Serum Creatinine1 <150 On diagnosis, annually or at follow -up if raised before Stage of CKD1,4 Translate the renal results (ACR & eGFR) into the stage of CKD - see notes. Liver Function Tests1 On diagnosis or annually HSE Model of Integrated Care for Patients with Type 2 Diabetes (2 018)1, ICGP (2016)2, HSE Diabetes Cycle of Care 20153, ADA Note: Target BGL may vary depending on local Endocrinologist policy. Client Resource s: 1. A form - My Diabetes Health Result Form (MDHRF) is avail able for use in 1 -1 care and SMES . It is available in the DISCOVER Diabetes - Type 2 handbook for clients. It is available in 2 formats - one without client name, one with client name and DOB to support people leaving with their GP /PN. In addition to clinical target information it includes other key information (i.e. DRS, foot care and the HS E 'My Medicines list'). See the support folder on Clinical Targets. The targets listed in the current MDHRF is in line with the targets presented above. Note Serum creatinine, stage of CKD and liver function tests are not on the form and are presented here for reference. Note HbA1c targets of 53 are presented. In practice it is important to consider and discuss HbA1c with groups and individuals in the context of individual goals i.e. 48 A guidance document re how to use the MDHRF form and a Green Paper of Evidence were prepared in 2018 and are available in the support folder/clinical targets/my diabetes health result form. The form was shared with the DESMOND WG to support exploration of how it could be integrated into DESMOND care, and educators tested use of same. Work will continue on exploring potential use of thi s form. 2. Diabetes Passports. These are small booklets that are in use within some diabetes care teams e.g. CHO2, ECAD, CHO9. Check with your local diabetes care team (e.g. acute, DNS, CDM team) what is in use in your area. It is important to check if the targets used in the MDHRF are different to those in the passports and to consider if discussions are needed with local stakeholders regarding updates, t o avoid confusion for the person with d iabe tes at all times. Written records of diabetes health results support care by informing people of their current diabetes care status, supporting the education process, empowering the person to engage in their self -care and attend follow -up check -ups as recommended by their d iabetes care team e.g. GP, PN, DNS, consultant and support their participation in review of future results. 29 FURTHER INFORMATION on Clinical Targets HbA1c further information: ADA 2019 recommends HbA1c more or less stringent goals should be individualized and based on factors: duration of diabetes, age/life expectancy, co -morbid conditions, known CVD or advanced micro -vascular complications, hypo unawareness, individual considerations, resources/support system. See Figure 6.1 from ADA pS64 below. Freque ncy of testing should be based on clinical situation, treatment regi men and clinician judgement . ADA EASD 2018 recommends 53 as the target for HbA1c and refers to the importance of atherosclerotic CVD risk management or ASCVD risk. A metabolic memory or legacy effect has been demonstrated in which a finite period of intensive control has shown benefits that lasted for decades after the control ended and so intensive HbA1c may yield enduring benefits. Thus striving for optimal HbA1c may now be the target f or some, especially for the newly diagnosed as soon as possible after diagnosis and if adverse effects can be avoided. (ADA 2019). 53 appropriate for most and shown to reduce dia betes related complications ( NCP -DM, 2018). The ADA EASD 2018 refers to this target offering benefit when the person is likely to have sufficient life expectancy to see microvascular bene fits (generally 10 years). 48 may be appropriate for select individuals if it can be achieved without hypos or adverse treatment effects (ADA 2019) - it may be suitable for newly diagnosed without significant co -morbidities/CVD, diet, lifestyle an d/or met formin treated, those with long life expectancy (ICGP 2016). 58 or less stringent may be appropriate for some (NCP -DM, 2018 ) - those unlikely to achieve longer term risk reduction benefits (i.e. reduced or limited life expectancy), those with a history of hypoglycaemia or with a high risk of the conseque nces of a hypo (e.g. risk of falling, those with reduced awar eness of hypos, those who drive or operate machinery as part of their job), advanced complications (micro or macro), extensive co -morbid conditions, where social circumstances may prevent tight blood glucose control. Clinicians are advised to exercise judg ement when interpreting results and be aware of the limitations of HbA1c which can affect the true result. It is affected by conditions that affect red blood cell turnover (i.e. anaemias, recent blood transfu sion, certain meds, pregnancy, CKD). not a measure of glycaemic varability or hypoglycaemia - though some clinicians have advised to consider the risk of possible hypos in those with HbA1c lower than expected or within tight targets. A combination of review of SMBG and HbA1c may be important for some clients e.g. those treated with insulin. The HbA1c may also inform the accuracy of a person's meter. See Reference table to assist interpreting HbA 1c levels with average blood glucose levels (ADA 2019). Blood Pressure further information: ADA 2019 rec ommends all hypertensive people should monitor their BP at home. Its role in detecting white coat hypertension, masked hypertension or other discrepancies between true and office BP and the role of home BP monitoring is highlighted. It can confirm or refute diagnosis and monitor treatment. Studies have shown it may better correlate with ASCVD risk and improve medicine adherence and thus help reduce risk. The Model of Integrated Care (HSE 2018) recommends 24hour blood pressure monitoring if a blood pressure reading is high at the clinic visit. Not reported in ICGP 2016. Lipids further information - the following was provided at the CROI Update on CVD - please discuss local practices : CROI 2018 Update on CVD - There was a move away from total cholesterol targets and no specific targets given for different groups. The 2016 ESC/EAS Guidelines for management of Dyslipidaemia were referred to wit h the main guidance for people with type 2 diabetes: - in people with type 2 diabetes and CVD or CKD, and in those without CVD who are >40 years of age with one or more other CVD risk factors or markers of target organ damage, the recommended goal for LDL is <1.8mmol/L and the secondary goal for non HDL C is <2.6mmol/l and for apoB is <80mg/dl. - In all people with type 2 diabetes and no additional risk factors and/or evidence of target organ damage, LDL <2.6mmol/l is the primary goal. Non HDL <3.4mmol/L and apoB <100mg/dL are the secondary goals. - LDL-C was discussed as t he main target for atherosclerosis. A UK speaker shared the move away from LDL and the use of non - HDL which is obtained via a non -fasting sample. NICE and ICGP had very similar guidance re H bAc1 but not re lipids. NICE: of note the NHS implemented a h ealth check initiative which s upported CVD risk assessments which is not in place in Ireland. This s upported CVD 10year risk assessment recommendations in management of CVD. NICE also highlighted TC and HDL as key lipid measures. ACR & eGFR further information ACR - there is biological variability in urinary albumin excretion and ADA 2019 advises 2 of 3 tests need to be abnormal to diagnosis albuminuria. ACR requires an early morning specimen and 2 out of 3 need to be positive over a 6 month period to indicate nephropathy (IC GP 2016). This practically means when a result is high a person is advised to go to their GP to review their result and to have a repeat ACR , to allow the GP to consider the result . It is important for clinicians to be aware of the factors which can affect ACR including exercise within 24h, infection, fever, congestive heart failure, marked hyperglycaemia , menstruation and marked hypertension.(ADA 2019). Confirmation of a CKD diagnosis is by the GP or diabetologist. ACR and eGF R can vary within people over time and abnormal results should be confirmed to stage CKD (ADA 2019) . Diabetic kidney disease is usually a clinical diagnosis made based on presence of albuminuria, and/or reduced eGFR in the absence of signs or symptoms of other primary causes of kidney damage (ADA 2019). Signs of CKD may be present at diagnosis and reduced eGFR without albuminuria has been reported in type 2 and is more common with the increasing prevalence of diabete s in the USA. At any eGFR the degree o f albuminuria is associated with risk of CKD progression, CVD and mortality (ADA 2019). 30 Guidance for the Individualization of Glycaemic Targets - ADA Figure 6.1 pS64 Average Blood Glucose Le vels for specified HbA1c levels (ADA 2019 - Glycemic Targets S63) HbA1c % (mmol/mol ) Mean plasma mmol/L PREMEAL glucose mmol/L Mean POSTMEAL glucose (9.1-10.7) 9.9 (9.3-10.6) 11.4 (10.8 -12.0) 12.3 (10.9 -13.8) 9 (75) 11.8 (9.4-13.9) 10 (86) 13.4 (10.7 -15.7) 11 (97) 14.9 (12.0 -17.5) 12 (108) 16.5 (13.3 -19.3) 31 CLINICAL TARGETS FOR OLDER ADULTS (ADA 2019) Clinic al targets for non -pregnant adults with T 2DM is presented in on page 17 . The ADA now also recommend extra consideration is given to older adults (65+ years of age). This is not reflected in current Irish guidelines - discuss current practice in local diabetes care teams. Please see framework below in th e table for considering treatment goals for glyce mia, blood pressure, and dyslipidemia in older adults (65+ years of age) with diabetes taken from Older Adults Standards of Medical Care in Diabetes, ADA 2019. Older Adults: Standards of Medical Care in Diabet es, ADA 2019 - Framework for considering treat ment goals for glycemia, blood pressure, and dyslipidemia in older adults with diabetes. Person with diabetes characteristics/health status Rationale Reasonable A1C goal l ***Fasting or preprandial glucose ***Bedtime glucose Blood Pressure Lipids Healthy (few coexisting chronic illnesses, intact cognitive and functional status) Longer remaining or 2+ instrumental ADL impairments or mild -to- moderate cognitive impairment) Intermediate remaining life expectancy, high treatment burden, hypoglycemia vulnerability, fall risk (LTC or end -stage chronic illnesses** or moderate -to- severe cognitive impairment or 2 + ADL dependencies) Limited remaining life expectancy makes benefit uncertain <69mmol/mol 5.6- 10.0mmol/L 6.1- 11.0mmol/L <150/90mmHg Consider likelihood of benefit with statin (secondary prevention more so than primary This represents a consensus framework for considering treatment goals for glycemia , blood pressure, and dyslipidemia in older adults with diabetes. The person characteristic categories are gen eral concepts . Not every person will clearly fall into a particular category. Consideration of individual and caregiver preferences is an important aspect of treatment individual ization. Additionally, a person 's health status and preferences may change over time. *** Many conditions associated with increased red blood cell turnover, such as haemodialysis , recent blood loss or transfusion, or erythropoietin therapy, are commonly seen in older adults with functional limitations, which can falsely increase or decrease A1C. In these instances, plasma blood glucose and finger stick readings should be used for goal setting A lower A1C goal may be set for an individual if achievable without recurrent or severe hypoglycemia or undue treatment burde n. * Coexisting chroni c illnesses are conditions serious enough to require medicine s or lifestyle management and may include arthritis, cancer, congestive heart failure, depression, emphysema, falls, hypertension, incontinence, stage 3 or worse chronic kidney d isease, myocardia l infarction, and stroke. \"Multiple\" means at least three, but many people may have five or more. ** The presence of a single end -stage chronic illness, such as stage 34 congestive heart failure or oxygen -dependent lung disease, chronic kidney disease requiring dialysis, or uncontrolled metastatic cancer, may cause significant symptoms or impairment of functional status and significantly reduce life expectancy. A1C of 69 mmol/mol equates to an estimated average glucose of 11.1 mmol/L. Looser A1C targets above 69 mmol/mol are not recommended as they m ay expose people to more frequent higher glucose values and the acute risks from glycosuria, dehydration, hyperglycemic hyperosmolar syndrome, and poor wound healing. 32 7. POSSIBLE COMPLICATIONS OF DIABETES The GP and practice nurse and DNS appointments (as required) , are a critical element to the proactive management of people with diabetes to maximise the quality of their outcomes and reduce the risks of developing diabetes related complications. As par t of one to one dietetic care and DSME group courses, the Commun ity Dietitian supports education on possible diabetes complications and the recommended follow -up/check -ups to prevent, detect and treat these. Clients are referred and sign -posted to the appropriate service as required e.g. DRS referral, recommend GP /PN/DNS appointment for review. DIABETIC RETINOPATHY / EYE CARE GUIDANCE AND DISEASE PREVENTI ON (MICROVASCULAR) \"Diabetic retinopathy is one of the most common causes of blindness in the working age population in Ireland and is one of th e most common se rious complications of diabetes. Up to 5% of patients with diabetes in Ireland may have sight -threatening diabetic retinopathy. This sight threatening condition is preventable by early detection , through population based screening and treatment\" (HSE National Clinical Programme for Diabetes 2018). The National Diabetic Retinal Screening Programme \"Diabetic Retina Screen which is part of the National Screening Service and Health Service Executiv e, is a quality assured government -funded programme that offers, free annual diabetic retinopathy screening to people with Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes aged 12 and over. The aim of the programme is to reduce the risk of sight loss among people with diabetes b y the early detection and treatment of sight -threatening retinopathy\" (HSE National Clinical Programme for Diabetes 2018). Screening \"Screening appointments last approximately 30 minutes during which dilating drops are administered to the eyes and speci alised digital photographs are taken of the retina. The images are then reviewed and subsequently graded. If the images taken show t hat further investigation and treatment is required, the participant will be referred to a Diabetic Retina Screen treatment clinic, however most participants will have a normal result and will be re -invited for annual screening\" (HSE National Clinical Programme for Diabetes 2018). Treatment \"Treatment for screen positive patients is delivered in one of the seven treatment clinics nationally. Treatment is delivered in line with Clinical Practice Guidelines for Treatment Clinics. A result letter will be sent within three weeks after the screening appointment advising of the next steps. Most people will have a normal result. They will have no retinopathy or will have early changes to their retina and will be invited back for routine diabetic retinopathy eye screening. Patients will be contacted for a further appointment if: The photographs are not clear enough to give a resu lt. You have diabetic retinopathy which needs to be assessed. Other eye conditions not caused by diabetes are detected and need to be assessed. Follow up or further assessments of diabetic retinopathy that are recommended as part of the screening prog ramme are free of charge\" (HSE National Clinical Programme for Diabetes 2018). The above information is taken from the Model of Integrated Care for type 2 diabetes, a guide for health care professionals clinical management guidelines (2018) by the HSE Na tional Clinical Programme for Diabetes. Please see entitlements section for how to access brochures for the retina screening service, how a person can find out if they are on the retina screening register and the possible options to support self-referral to the retina screening programme . FOOT CARE GUIDANCE/ DISEASE PREVENTION ( MICROVASCULAR) \"Diabetic foot disease is one of the most feared and costly complications of Type 2 diabetes. People with Type 2 diabetes are at increased risk of foot ulceration and lower -limb amputation\" (HSE National Clinical Programme for Diabetes 2018). Incidence \"The annual risk of foot ulceration is 2.2% -7.0% in people with diabetes\"(Jeffcoate WJ, Harding KG, 2003). \"People with diabetes have a 10 to 20 -fold increased risk of lower -limb amputation compared to non -diabetic people\" (Abbott CA et al 2002). Monitoring \"Everyone with diabetes should have their foot examined at diagnosis and at annual review thereafter\" (HSE National Clinical Programme f or diabetes 2018). 33 Classification of risk \"People with diabetes should have their feet examined and classified according to their risk of foot disease: Low, medium, high or active foot disease\" (HSE National Clinical Programme for Diabetes 2018). The i nformation a bove is taken from the Model of Integrated Care for type 2 diabetes, a guide for health care professionals clinical management guidelines (2018) by the HSE National Clinical Programme for Diabetes. Foot Care Patient Education \"Foot Care education improves the knowledge and behaviour towards foot care in the short term in people with diabetes. This should encompass foot hygiene, the need for daily foot inspection, suitable foot wear, prompt treatment of new lesions and th e importance of r egular podiatric visits\" (SIGN 2010). It is recommended to be aware of local podiatry services in the local HSE area and services provided by local Diabetes Irelan d Care Centres. It would also be beneficial to signpost the client to their practice nurse o r GP in their surgery for their annual foot screen as recommended by the model of care for the diabetic foot (HSE 2012). Resources to support foot care advice are available for those with low, moderate and high risk foot. https://www.hse.ie/eng/health/hl/living/diabetes/foot%20care%20information%20leaflets.html Further reading: Model of car e for the diabetic foot (HSE O ctober 2011 ): https://www.hse.ie/eng/about/who/cspd/ncps/diabetes/moc/ Please note the model of care for the diabetic f oot is due to be updated , however a s of January 2020 there has been no further update. Plea se also see entitlements appendix for further resources and entitlements regarding foot care . NEUROPATHY (MICROVASCULAR) \"Diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) is one of the commonest complications of Type 2 diabetes and may be present at time of diagnosis. Diabetes can affect all nerves and so diabetic neuropathies are heterogeneous with diverse clinical manifestation s. The y may also be focal or diffuse, the most common diffuse neuropathy is the chronic sensory motor neuropathy (glove and stocking) diabetic peripheral neuropathy and the most common focal neuropathy is carpal tunnel syndrome. DPN may be present at time of diagnosis in over 10% of patients and may affect up to 50% of patients with long standing diabetes . 50% of diabetic peripheral neuropathy may be asymptomatic but in 16% to 26% of patients with diabetes the neuropathy is painful\" (Harkins, Smith and Gleeson.2 016). Monitoring \"Patients should be examined for DPN from time of diagnosis and their feet should be examined annually for signs of periphera l neuropat hy\" (Harkins, Smith and Gleeson, 2016). This is usually completed at diagnosis and as part of the annual foot screen as referenced in the Model of Integrated Care for Type 2 Diabetes (2018) . Treatment \"The first step is to aim for stab le and optimal glucose control\" (Harkins, Smith and Gleeson 2016). It would also be beneficial to signpost the client to their practice nurse or GP in their surgery for their annual foot screen. NEPHROPATHY (MICROVASCULAR) Diabetic renal disease is a glomerular disorder characterised by structural and functional changes, which may lead to proteinuria and/or decline in kidney function. It may be progressive and result in end -stage renal disease, which may require renal replacement therapy (dialysis or trans plantation) (Waas JH, Shalet SM, 2002) Please se e Appendix on Chronic Kidney disease for further information on assessment and dietetic treatment of CKD. ORAL HEALTH (MICROVASCULAR) People with diabetes are susceptible to oral sensory, periodontal and salivary disorders which could increas e their risk of developing new and recurrent dental caries. Several studies have reported greater history of dental caries in people with diabetes. Factors for caries development include poor control of diabetes control. People with diabetes have been reported to complain of dry mouth. A study detected impaired salivary uptake and excretion in adults with type 2 diabetes. The cause is unknown but may be related to polyuria or to alterations in the basement membranes of sal ivary glands. People with diabetes are more susceptible to opportunistic infections such as oral candidiasis. Fungal infections are commonly found in adults with poorly controlled diabetes (Above referenced from Thuyumanavan et al 2015). 34 Treatment Thuyu manavan et al (2015) suggest a good oral hygiene routine, regular visits to a dentist, eating a healthy diet and controlling blood glucose levels will help reduce a client's risk of poor oral health. Resource: Diabetes Ireland and the Dental Health Foundation have also produced an information card on diabetes and oral health for adults which can be given to clients with type 2 diabetes. This can be dow nloaded or can be ordered from D ental Health Foundation Ireland . https://www.dentalhealth.ie/assets/files/pdf/diabetes_adult_postcard_final.pdf You can find further information on entitlements with regard to oral he alth in the entitlements appendix of the care plan. ERECTILE DYSFUNCTION (MICROVASCULAR) \"Moderate to severe erectile dysfunction affects approximately 5 -20% of all men and is common in middle -aged and older men with type 2 diabetes where it may affect up to 50% of patients\" (American Diabetes Association, Clinical Practice Recommendations 2013; Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network 2010; National Institute for Cli nical Excellence 2009 ). Treatment The following are all beneficial in improving erectil e function: reducing alcohol intake (see section on alcohol for further guidelines) ; increasing exercise (see section on physical activity for further guidelines) losing weight (see section on weight management for further information) In addition counse lling or stress management may help erectile function. Signposting the person to their GP for a medicine review may also be beneficial as some medicine s can affect erectile dysfunction. This above information has been obtained from the HSE Model of Integrated Care for D iabetes 2018. CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE (MACROVASCULAR) The ICGP guidelines (2016) state that risk of cardiovascular disease is increased 2- 4 fold in patients with diabetes. It is the main cause of death in Type 2 diabetes with excess mortality seen in all age groups, especially younger age groups. The underlying pathology is usually atherosclerosis which develops insidiously over many years and i s usually advanced by the time symptoms occur . The risk of myocardial infarction and stroke is two to five times higher than in the general population. Peripheral vascular disease (PVD), defined as lower extremity arterial atherosclerosis, is a significant complication of type 2 diabetes. PVD, as with other manifestations of cardiovascular disease, is more common in individuals with type 2 diabetes tha n in the general population (MacGregor st al 1999) . . Monitoring According to the ICGP guidelin es (2016) the key to the management of complications is early detection and prompt intervention. Therefore systematic screening for complications forms part of a diabetes integrated care programme including monitoring blood pressure, cholesterol levels and blood glucose. Further information on monitoring of these risk factors can be found in the section on clinical targets for adults with type 2 diabetes in the care plan. Treatment Non -Pharmacotherapy ICGP guidelines (2016) state that lifestyle modification focusing on the reduction of saturated fat, trans fat, and cholesterol intake; increase of omega -3 fatty acids, fibre, and plant stanols/sterols; weight loss (if indicated); and increased physical activity should be recommended to improve the lipid profile in p eople with diabetes. The American Diabetes Association (2019) states that nutrition therapy that includes the development of an eating plan design ed to optimize blood glucose trends, blood pressure, and lipid pro files is important in th e management of diabetes and can lower the risk of CVD, CHD, and stroke. Findings from clinical trials support the role of nutrition therapy for achieving glycaemic targets and decreasing various markers of cardiovascular and hypertension risk. Please see appendices on dietary recommendations for adults with type 2 diabete s and physical activity for more specific dietetic information. As the pharmacotherapy treatment is outside the scope of this care plan, further reading on this can be found in the follow ing documents: 1. https://www.hse.ie/eng/about/who/cspd/ncps/diabetes/moc/model -of-integrated -care -type -2-diabetes -2018.pdf 2. ICGP A pra ctical Guide to Integrated Type 2 Diabetes Care (2016) 35 NON ALCOHOLIC FATTY LIVER DISEASE (NAFLD) NAFLD is Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease Is considered to be the liver manifestation of the metabolic syndrome, characterised by excessive fat accumulation in the liver (Norris 2018). There is also a progressive form of NAFLD called Non Alcoholic Steatohepatitis (NASH). According to the EASL -EASD -EASO Clinical Practice Guidelines for the management of NAFLD (2016), BMI and increased waist circumference are positively related to the presence of NAFLD. Common comorbidities such as people with Type 2 Diabetes show a higher prevalence of NAFLD a nd liver disease progression such as NASH. Screening for NAFLD in the popul ation at risk should be in the context of the available resources, considering the burden for the national health care systems and the currently limited effective treatments. The ICGP guid elines (2016) and the HSE Model of Integrated Care for Patients wit h type 2 diabetes (2018) recommends the GP check LFT's at a person 's initial assessment after diagnosis of type 2 diabetes. The HSE Model of Integrated Care (2018) also recommends checking LFT's at a person 's annual review. However it is important to note that Norris (2018) indicated that LFT's may be normal in 80% of NAFLD patients. Crosbie (2018) reports that there are also non invasive tests to identify those with NAFLD such as fatty liver index, steato test or NAFLD liver fa t score which GP's can carry out. A liver ultrasound is the preferred option for those at risk of NASH (Crosbie 2018) . This is likely to be an area where we will see more research and guidance emerge for people with type 2 diabetes over the coming years. Treatment Norris (2018) states that for people who have NAFLD and type 2 diabetes, the treatment of diabetes in consultation with the diabetic team is important as well as the treatment of obesity through diet and lifestyle and/or bariatric surgery. Losing more than 10% weight can re move some fat from the liver and improve inflammation in your liver (Crosbie 2018). Norris and Crosbie (2018) both describe lifestyle changes in NAFLD as being the fo undation of any treatment plan and state that it is advisable to attend a dietitian for guidance on this.

DIABETES SEL F MANAGEMENT EDUCATION (DSME ) & HSE Courses Diabetes Self-management Education courses involve face to face contact in group or individual one to one sessions with trained educators. The role of virtual online sessions is being explored in 2020. A key component in self-management support for care of people with diabetes is Structured Patient Education (SPE). Evidence based group education is often referred to as SPE and the standard s for same have been defined by NICE in 2003 and adopted by the HSE in 2009. Courses have been referred to as SPE courses, but since 2018 in Ireland, are being referred to as diabetes support courses when advertising to the public , to improve the understa nding of what the course is for the public and to support better engagement with registration to attend. This will be explored further with public consultation. The HSE Model of Integrated care for Type 2 Diabetes suggests that within 3 months of being newly diagnosed with Type 2 Diabetes, people should receive a structured Type 2 Diabetes education package (i.e. X-PERT, DESMOND or CODE). In autumn 2019 the HSE DISCOVER DIABETES -Type 2 course was offered and in 2020 the DSME courses in Ireland include s DESMOND, DISCOVER DIABETES - Type 2 and CODE. The package will give the person with diabetes appropriate dietetic input and advice regarding their clinical care. Those not suitable for group will receive a one to one consult with a Dietitian. In dividual s and their families/carers can register online at the link www.hse.ie/diabetescourses or by searching 'Diabetes course' . Courses can facilitate people with diabetes being supported by different members of the multidisciplinary care team (e.g. Dietitian and nurse educators, additional inputs from podiatrists, DNS, physiotherapists, mental health nurses, psychologists, health promotion officers (ph ysical activity, smoking), etc.). Courses are intended to be included within an ongoing model of edu cation and care, integrating life long learning, care planning and optimisation of treatment. There are four critical time points when the need for diabetes education is required and th e AADE7 Self -care bahaviours provide a framework for identifying topics to include at each time (healthy eating, being active, monitoring, taking medicine , problem solving, reducing risk, healthy coping) ; (1) At diagnosis, (2) Annually for assessment of education, nutrition and emotional need, (3) When new complicating factors arise (health conditions, physical limitations, emotional factors, or basic living needs) that influence self -management, (4) When transitions in care occur (Powers et al, 2015 , ADA 2019 ). See summary in D iabetes SMES support folder . Structu red diabetes education courses are beneficial and clinically effective for people with Type 2 Diabetes demonstrating improvements in glycaemic control, weight loss, quality of life and reducing cardiovascular risk (Deakin et al, 2006; Lov eman et al, 2008; Piatt et al, et 2008; Chrvala et al, 2016; Steinsbeck et al, 2012; Guo et al, 2014) The HSE carried out a review of SMES programmes and it was found the benefits of the programme include - increased application by the individual of knowledge/understanding of diabetes, self-empowerment with the person effectively and confidently participating in their own self-management , psychological adjustment to living with diabetes, improved undertaking of diabet es self-management behaviours and improved clinical outcomes (HSE, 2009 ). The Health Technology Assessment (HTA) was carried out by the Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA) in 2015 at the request of the HSE to examine the clinical and cost effectiveness of generic self-management support interventions for COPD, asthma, cardiovascular disease and diabetes (HIQA, 2015). This showed there is very good evidence that SMES , including culturally appropriate education, can improve blood glucose control in people with Type 2 diabetes. This report also suggests that diabetes self-management education programmes are cost -effective relative to usual care. A 2018 review reported, p eople who are empowered and skilled to self -manage thei r diabetes have improved health outcomes. Over the past 20 years, diabetes self -management education programmes have been shown to be efficacious and cost -effective in promotion and facilitation of self -managemen t, with improvements in individuals ' knowled ge, skills, and motivation leading to improved biomedical, behavioural, and psychosocial outcomes (Chatterjee et al, 2018) . The Community Nutrition and Dietetics SPE working group on Audit, completed a review of evidence on effectiveness of HSE ran courses (X -PERT & DESMOND) in 2018. International and national evidence was reviewed. A summary of this evidence and a database of evidence reviewed (as an excel workbook) is available for all educators, see on the next page. Self management group education has also been shown to be cost effective in people with Type 2 Diabetes (Jacobs et al, 2011). SMES should be provided to people with Type 2 Diabetes and ongoing support offered to include follow up (ADA 2019). When group based education courses are offered, education on diet, lifestyle and explanation of clinical outcomes are discussed and a follow up session should be off ered within 6 months and ongoing review yearly (MOC, 2018). From 2020 in Ireland there will be three programmes for people with type 2 diabetes that aspire to these standards . The HSE DISCOVER DIABETES - Type 2 (Diabetes Insights & Self -Care Options Via Education & Reflection) and DESMOND (Diabetes Education and Self -Management for On -going and Newly Diagnosed diabetes) courses , offered in primary care and facil itated by Dietitians and diabetes nurses. CODE - Community Orientated Diabetic Education is offered by Diabetes Ireland. 37 Summar y of evidence : Notes for table (* significant , NS - not sign ificant, M = months ).

HOW TO REFER TO DIABETES SUPPORT COURSES All health care professionals can refer people with Type 2 Diabetes to local courses through local HSE Community Nutrition and Dietetic Services but also through the online service at www.hse.ie/diabetescourses People with diabetes can also self -refer at this link and are welcome to call HSE Live on 1850 24 1850 or 041 -6850300 who will help a person register and/or email local team contacts on their behalf. People are welcome to bring a family member, carer or friend but to book a place for them. People are welcome to attend at any location of their preference, anywhere in Ireland. People are welcome to attend the first session to see how it suits their needs. Information on courses : see www.hse.ie/diabetes courses for information on available courses. 38 Diabetes Ireland Online Course - Diabetes Smart (01-8428118) Diabetes Ireland offer an online course called ' Diabetes Smart'. It consists of a series of short videos on various topics of living with type 2 diabetes including: 'what is face -to-face struct ured patient e ducation course s, it is a useful educational tool which gives essential information to people with type 2 diabetes, particularly those who are newly diagnosed. It may be most helpful for those individuals who are unable to attend HSE courses. Follow this link to get access to this FREE online educational course. www.diabeteseducation.ie FURTHER READING - Self Management & the HSE HSE Living with a Chronic Condition: Framework for self management support In 2017 the HSE launched th is framework which provides an overview of the rationale for self -management support; and sets out how the HSE will implement self -management support for these four major chronic conditions, one of which is dia betes. Self Management Support Co -ordinators were later employed in the HSE and in 2019 produced local directory of services to support people with long term conditions. See the website for your local directory and the support folder Psychosocial care & support for an example of the press release. Diabetes Self-Management support is the systemic provision of education and supportive in terventions to increase a person 's skills and confidence in managing their health problems, including regular assessmen t of progress and problems, goal setting and problem solving support. It is an important element of person cen tred care, acknowledging people with Type 2 Diabetes as partners in their own care, supporting them in developing the knowledge, skills and confid ence to make informed decisions The majority of care for chronic conditions is provided and coordinated by the person themselves with the support of family members and carers at home and in the community. A person with diabetes has on average 3 ho urs contact a year with a healthcare team. They self -manage their condition for the remaining 8757 hours in the year, remembering to take their medicine s, trying to change behaviour, dealing with the effects on emotions and relationships and on the activit ies of daily living. There is evidence that certain interventions which support self -managem ent improve outcomes for people with diabete s - ranging from quality of life and clinical outcomes, to reduced healthcare utilisation including hospitalisation. Support for patient self -management is a key element of person centred care, one of the four domains of quality in Irish healthcare. Principles of the self-management support framework There are four overarching, evidence based principles of self -management support which underpin this framework. 1. People with Type 2 Diab etes should be seen as active partners in their healthcare. 2. Supporting self -management is inseparable from high q uality care for people with long term conditions 3. Investment should be prioritised in those interventions for which there are good evidence of clinical effectiveness. 4. A whole system approach to implementation of self-management support should be tak en (Framework for self-management ) Please follow this link for more information - https://www.hse.ie/eng/health/hl/selfmanagement/ Other Support - See Appendix - Psychosocial care & support. Link with HSE MDT colleagues and the local health promotion department re other supports for self -management and support e.g. CVD Sub -group/Community Nurse initiatives. 39 9. ENTITLEMENTS for People with Type 2 Diabetes Long term illness Card (LTI) - (no longer a booklet) Everyone with Type 2 diabetes, regardless of income/circumstances is entitled to a Long term illness (LTI) book. All people with diabetes are entitled to receive their diabetes medicine s, pens/syringes lancets, blood glucose monitoring strips FREE of charge. You will also be able to receive medicine s for associated conditions such as cholesterol lowering and blood pressure medicine , if prescribed. Many people with type 2 diabetes have no t been aware of this entitlement. This information is correct as of July 2019. There has been some recent changes to the LTI scheme with regards to the following: 1. A new address for sending completed documentation to The process for new and review LTI applications is centralised through the Primary Care Reimbursement Scheme rather than through your Local Health Office. The new address is: Long Term Illness Scheme, Client Registration Unit , PO Box 12962, Dublin 11, D11 XKF3. 2. A new form -There is a new form in use and old forms will no longer be accepted. A copy of the form can be found at https://www 2.hse.ie/services/long -term -illness -scheme/apply -for-a-long -term -illness -scheme -card.html 3. A new LTI card - LTI Cards will be issued going forward but existing LTI Books will remain valid for the time being. 4. Residency requirements - Applicants must be ordinarily resident i.e. live here and intend to live here for at least one year. 5. A new online express registration service for pharmacists to register people with certain conditions For newly diagnosed people who are not yet on the LTI scheme there is a new Express LTI registration which can be completed online by a pharmacist. Express LTI registration is for people with certain new diagnoses where the medicine prescribed confirms the diagnosis. Diabetes Mellitus is one of these diagnoses. If a pharmacist registers the client using the Express LTI registration then you must still submit your completed application form to the LTIS Client Registration Unit within two months to continue to get medicine free. 6.For people who already have a LTI bo ok and the book is full, they can contact the LTI who will re -issue a new card in place of the book. List of all medicine s which are included on the LTI scheme Alpha -glucosidase inhibitor - acarbose. Anti-hypertensives, including diuretics. Aspirin. Biguanides. Consumable items like sensors required for use with insulin pumps. Control solutions for use with meters. Dextrose gel. DPP-4 Sulphonylureas. Test strips including : blood glucose test strips, and urine test strips. Thiazolidinediones. Warfarin and new oral anticoagulants. Please also see list below - https://www2.hse.ie/services/long -term -illness -scheme/approved -medications.html Note meters are not included. More information can be found at - https://www2.hse.ie/services/long -term -illness -scheme/long -term -illness.html Hypoglycaemia treatment In relation to hypo treatment following discussion with local pharmacist s and with HSE live (CHO 3 & 7), Dextrose gel is approve d on the LTI medicine list (see above). Glucogel and glucojuice are also both covered under the LTI scheme. The glucose sweets seem to have been removed in favour of the Glucogel and glucojuice. This information is correct as of July 2019 however this may change and therefore it is important to keep up to date and inform colleagues of any changes you are made aware of. See Hypo Appendix for more information. In Sept 2020 this was review ed by the Primary Care Pharmacist (CHO1), rep on the NCP -Diabetes programme and the following was advised for clients ' A range of hypo treatments are ava ilable through your pharmacy. I f your hypo treatment is prescribed by your GP or clinician it may be available un der the LTI scheme. Check with your pharmacy what is currently available under the LTI scheme.'. It is best not to specify products as name s / strengths change. Where 40 a patient suffers hypos their consultant or GP can write a prescription for one of the glucose treatments , the pharmacist can upload the prescription to PCRS on their s oftware and seek approval online. How people apply for an LTI book Send a completed long term illness scheme application form (LTI form) to Long Term Illness Scheme, Client Registration Unit, PO Box 12962, Dublin 11, D11 XKF3. To qualify, you must be 'resident' in the Republic of Ireland. This means that you are living here and intend to live here for at least one year. The person 's doctor or consultant will need to sign the form. They will: confirm the condition list the medicine and any appliances the person needs to treat the condition. You can log onto the HSE website to find more information and to down load the LTI application form - LoCall: 1890 252 919 or go to www.hse.ie/LTI *Please see correspondence from Anne Marie Hoey, Assistant National Director. Primary Care Reimbursement & eligibility which outlines more information on the centralisation of the LTI scheme in the care plan folder on Entitlements. Diabetic Retina Screenin g-annually (NRS) Everyone with Type 2 Diabetes should have their eyes checked annually. The HSE National Diabetic Retinal Screening Programme (Diabetic RetinaScreen) offers FREE, regular screening for diabetic retinopathy a complication that can happen from diabetes. For more information see http://www.diabeticretinascreen.ie People can check if they are on the eye screening register by A) phoning 1800 45 45 55 B) Self-registration is also possible via the DRS website - once people complete the form, they are advised to print the registration form and bring it to their doctor for signing. https://apps.diab eticretinascreen.ie/diabetic -screening/public -registration.612.drsregistration.html C) If you are a health care professional you can register a person with diabetes by phoning 1800 45 45 55 or see consent form in entitlements folder. You can sign the health professional section of the consent form and allow the person with diabetes to complete the form and return it themselves to DRS. It is advised to have copies of the DRS leaflet available for people when discussing the form to support informed consent. D) As a health care professional you can also register a person online or verify they are registered - http://www.diabeticretinascreen.ie/health -professionals.24.html The locations list for screening has been updated and is on the website, this should be checked regularly for changes in location. Resources : An information leaflet can be downloaded from the website (throu gh link above) also for people with diabetes to be used in clinic/group setting. A pictorial version is also available for those with literacy issues. A poster is available for use in clinic/SPE. You can download and order copies from www.healthbrochures .ie -search 'retina' (If ordering online, maximum order 50 leaflets) Local HPO for screening provided an information document on DRS in Spring 2019 to CHO 4 which is available to all. More information on eye drops used can be found in the entitlements fo lder. Support from NRS : NRS have been supporting SPE courses for years as part of an initiative between NRS & X -PERT SPE WG. 1. Screeners were informed of local courses by local Community Dietitian teams and use d posters and tear -off pads to promote awareness of DSME core courses and follow -up courses (see the Recruitment Guidance for X -PERT for more info on the initiative). Consider linking with local HPOs and screeners to support promotion of current DSME delivery by your team. 2. Health Promotion Officers for Screening (including Reti nal Screening) have attended SMES sessions to promote awa reness of the service to people with diabete s and to answer queries. They have also supported local Community Dietitian team updates. The two health promotion officers who can be contacted contact to discuss any issues are Aoife Collins PhD, Senior Health Promotion Officer, National Screening Service, BreastCheck Southern Unit, Infirmary Road, NSS Community Rathass, Tralee, Training - Diabetic Retina screening module: You can also log onto the health professionals section and complete the Diabetic Retina screening module for Health Professionals. Foot check s - at least annually Every year your GP/Practice Nurse/ Podiatrist should carry out a foot screening examination on anyone with Type 2 Diabetes where they test the feeling and the blood supply in your feet. From this test the person is classified as having low, moderate or high risk diabetic feet. 41 -Those who have been classified as having a low or moderate risk diabetic foot, are over the age of 65 years and have a medical card may be able to apply for a ' Chiropody Card' . The availability of chiropody / podiatry services and the chiropody card provided by the HSE varies in different areas therefore it is bes t to contact your GP, IC P Senior Diabetes Dietitian or Clinical Nurse Specialist in Diabetes in your area to find out further information . The chiropody card if available may entitle you a certain amount of podiatry foot care treatments a year at a reduced price. To apply for this card, a form must be filled out by a person's GP or practi ce nurse and returned to HSE Local Health Office. If the chiropody card is granted, the amount of podiatry foot care treatments you are entitled to with the card will be provided along with a list of the local private podiatrists who accept the chiropody ca rd. Please follow the following link for more information on foot care . https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/health/health_services/care_in_your_community/chiropody_services.html - For those who have been classified as having a moderate risk or high risk diabetic foot , the HSE holds a Foot clinic run by podiatrists in HSE primary care centres. SERVICES CAN VARY THEREFORE LINK WITH SERVICES LOCALLY re local management of moderate an d high risk diabetes feet . Those who have an active foot ulceration should be seen by the hospital podiatrist. People can only be referred to these clinics by their GP, nurse, podiatrist or other health care professionals. Resources to support footcare advice are available for those with low, moderate and high risk foot. https://www.hse.ie/eng/health/hl/living/diabetes/foot%20care%20information%20leaflets.html Tax relief and podiatry services Non -medical card holders may be able to claim tax relief on health services such as podiatry care if they are required to attend as part of medical treatment and your doctor directs you to attend. You may also be able to claim tax relief on any doctor's vis its and prescription drugs associated with this care using the Med 1 form. Dietary Financial support There is no dietary sup plement but a person already receiving a social welfare payment may apply to their local welfare officer to have a discretionary additional payment. For more information see https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/supplementary_welfare_sch emes/supplementary _welfare_allow.html In addition, a person may be able to claim Tax relief on foods used to treat hypoglyceamia or purchased as part of a dietary plan - For more information see - Consider if the person is taking medicine that poses a risk of hypo and if they are eligible for support via the LTI re treatment options. Dental services There are some dental services which people with Type 2 Diabetes are entitled to if they have a medical card under the Dental Treatment Service Scheme. All medical card holders are entitled to specific dental treatments e.g. a dental examination, two filli ngs in each calendar year, extractions as necessary. Additional treatments for example, teeth cleaning are available to those persons with specific medical conditions e .g. Type 2 Diabetes - the person' s dentist w ill be able to advise them of the ir entitlem ent if this is the case. The HSE dental section may require written docu mentation outlining the person' s medical condi tion and/or medicine s from thei r G.P. or other relevant medical person. Some treatments such as the provision of dentures require the approval of the HSE before the dentist can proceed and in this case, the dentist applies directly to the HSE. At the end of the treatment the dentist will ask the person with diabetes to sign a form certifying that the treatment detailed on the form has been received by the person and that he/she are willing to attend a HSE dentist for examination if requested. The dental treatments available on the medical card may change from time to time. Other information The Treatment Benefit Scheme - this is run by the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection (DEASP) and provides dental services to insured workers, the self -employed and retired people who have the required number of PRSI cont ributions. Under this scheme, the Department pays the full cost of an oral examination once a calendar year. Since 28 October 2017, a payment of \u20ac42 towards either a scale and polish or, if clinically necessary, periodontal treatment, is also available once a calendar year. If the cost of either cleaning or periodontal treatment is more than \u20ac42, you must pay the balance - capped at \u20ac15 for a scale and polish. There is no cap on the balance charged for periodontal treatment. Treatment is provided by private dentists who are on the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection's panel. Lists of dentists on the panel are available on welfare.ie . Most dentist s are on the panel, so you should not have any difficulty finding one. The dentist will be able to check your eligibility and make a claim for you. The claim form will require details such as your Personal Public Service Number (PPS number) , date of birth and signature. If you are a dependent spouse or civil partner, you should give the PPS number of the insured person, who wi ll also be required to sign the claim form. 42 Private Insurance - Some private insurance companies like - DCARE offers additiona l dental treatments for people with diabetes.

HYPERTENSION & HYPERLIPIDAEMIA (CVD risk factors) - Summary of Dietary recommendations Hypertension Hyperlipidaemia For people with blood pressure > 120/80mmHg weight loss and DASH style dietary pattern are encouraged and include lowering the following; Moderation of Alcohol Intake : Avoid excessive alcohol consumption - 2 servings per day in men and 1 serving per day in women. Lowering Sodium Intake: Decrease salt intake to less than 6g per day. Increase consumption of fruit & vegetables: typically 5 -7 portions per day , with ADA 2019 recommending between 8 -10 per day. Aim to have low fat dairy: up to 3 servings per day. Saturated fats should be limited and replaced by unsaturated fats . It is not recommended to replace any reduction in energy from saturated fat with refined carbohydrate. Intake of trans fats from processed foods should be avoided due to their harmful effect. Eating pattern emphasising a diet high in mono and polyunsaturated fats may be considered to lower risk of cardiovascular disease and can be effective as an alternati ve to a diet low in total fat and high in carbohydrates. Plants sterols and stanols are effective in lowering LDL by 10% when 2g per day are consumed in addition to diet & pharma cological therapies. Note: Plant sterols or stanols are not recommended for primary prevention of CVD in Type 2 Diabetes. In people with type 2 diabetes supplementation with Omega 3 PUFA is not recommended. Eating foods rich in long chain n3 fatty acids such as fatty fish (EPA & DHA), nuts and seeds (ALA) is recommended. Application of a Mediterranean diet or Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension is recommended . 30g of unsalted nuts per day has been shown to reduce the risk of CVD by 30% but it should be noted that energy intake of nuts is high (ESC 2016) A high fibre intake lowers Total and LDL cholesterol. 30-45g of Fibre is recommended per day preferably from wholegrain products. An increase in viscous fibre is recommended . Physical activity: 150 mins . of moderate activity over at least 3 days aiming not to have 2 consecutive days without physical activity should be recommended . (See Appendix on Physical Activity). A 5% weight loss has been shown to be of benefit . (See Appendix on Obesity/Overweight). *Further supporting information on DASH & Mediterranean diet, Fat (saturated, MUFA, PUFA, Trans fat, oily fish & fish oil supplements) above can be found under Dietary Recommendations (see Appendix). 44 11. HYPOGLYCAEMIA - (addressing Management, ID, ICE, Dri ving Guidance) Please see Appendix and support folder on Blood Glucose Monitoring a nd the support folder on Hypoglycaemia for further guidance relevant to this section. Hypoglycaemia is an acute complication affecting people with type 2 diabetes treated with insulin or insulin secretagogues (D UK , 2018) and i ndividuals at risk for hypoglycaemia (hypo) should be asked about it at every encounter (ADA, 2019). Prevention is preferable to treatment and attending structured education has been recommended (D U K, 2018). Individual glucose targets, patient education, dietary intervention, exercise management, medicine adjustment, glucose monitoring and routine clinical surveillance improve outcomes (ADA, 2019). There is evi dence of a prevalence of about 45% among people with type 2 diabetes (D UK, 2018). Changes in food intake, physical activity and/or medicine can contribute. The Model of Integrated care for patients with type 2 diabetes (2018) core dataset includes severe hypoglycaemia and impaired aw areness of hypoglycaemia. The 4monthly and annual review visit assessment by a GP or PN includes review of severe hypoglycaemia and hypo awareness (NCP -DM, 2018 ). The ADA 2019 discusses recommendations in terms of 3 levels of classification of hypo Level Glycaemic criteria/description Further details 1 3-3.9 mmol/L 3.9 has been recognised as the threshold for neuroendocrine respon ses to falling glucose in people without diabetes. Because many people with diabetes demonstrate impaired counterregulat ory responses to hypo and/or experience hypo unawareness , a measure of 3.9 is considered clinically important , independe nt of the severity of the a cute hypo symptoms. 2 <3.0 mmol/L This is the threshold at which neuroglycopenic symptoms begin to occur and requires immediate action to resolve the hypo event. 3 Severe event characterised by altered mental and/or physical status requiring assistance Requires assistance by another person to recover. Risk factors include age, race, older adults with type 2 diabetes on insulin, those with poor or moderate vs good glycaemic control, albuminuria and poor cognitive function. Hypoglycaemia can be frightening and inconvenient to people with diabetes. Symptoms can include shakiness, irritabili ty, confusion, tachycardia and hunger but are not limited to these. Level 3 may be recognised or unrecognized and can progress to loss of consciousness, seizure, coma or death (ADA, 2019). The administration of rapid acting glucose or glucagon is requir ed to reverse hypos. Hypos can cause acute harm to the person with diabetes and others, especially if it causes falls, motor vehic le accidents or other injury. It has been suggested that among older adults with type 2 diabetes a history of level 3 hypo was associated with a greater level of dementia (ADA, 2019). Those particularly vulnerable to hypos include: the elderly with type 2 diabetes because of their reduced ability to recognize symptoms and effectively communicate their needs (ADA, 2019). Hypoglycaemia Manag ement (ADA, 2019; D UK 2018): The goal of treatment is to immediately relieve symptoms and limit the risk of injury, while avoiding overtreatment. 1. TREAT - 15-20g glucose is the preferred firstline treatment for hypoglycaemia but 30g may be needed to treat a sever e hypo. 10g and 20g of oral glucose increase blood glucose by approx.2 and 5mmol/L respectively. The acute glycaemic response correlates to the glucose content of the food rather than the carbohydrate content. Sucrose is effective and may be more palatable than glucose e.g. sweets, sugar lumps, dissolved in water. Orange juice is considered to be less effective than oral glucose. Added fat and protein containing foods will not be as effective as glucose containing food/drink. Respon se to glucose ingestion should occur withi n 10-20 minutes, when hypo symptoms should have resolved. 2. Retest blood glucose after 15 minutes and repeat treatment if blood glucose level has not risen above 4mmol/l. Depending on individual needs and treatment, a follow -up snack providing 15 -20g carbohydrate may be necessary to prevent recurrent hypoglycaemia. 3. Support people to understand the situations that increase hypo risk (such as fasting, when meals delayed, during after consumption of alcohol, during and after intense exe rcise and during sleep), to consider their hypo cause and to share this with their diabetes care team. Diabetes UK (2018): an individualised approach to hypoglycaemia management with appropriate monitoring is recommended. One example of a strategy commonly recommended is: take 15 -20g of glucose; repeat treatment if blood glucose level has not risen above 4mmol/l after 15 minutes; depending on individual needs and treatment, a fol low up snack providing 15 -20g of carbohydrate may be necessary . The use of a bedtime snack in reducing the risk of nocturnal hypos is not routinely recommended, but may be considered on an individual basis e.g. hypo unawareness, prior physical activity, al cohol consumption, presenting with night time blood glucose levels close to 4. Hypo un awareness can severely compromise diabetes control and quality of life. Several weeks of avoidance of hypos has been demonstrated to improve hypo awareness in many people with diabetes. Hence those with at least 2 clinically significant hypos may benefit from at least short term relaxation of glycaemic targets. Discuss such cases with GPs. 4. The use of glucagon is indicated for treatment for people unable or unwilling to consume carbohydrate by mouth (ADA,2019). Current guidance and practice in Ireland regarding prescribing glucagon kits for people with type 2 d iabetes who are insulin treated or may require same , requires further review. Discuss local practices with local diabetes care teams. 45 TREATMENT Hypo Rx 15g Glucose 30g Glucose Examples 170ml Lucozade Original (new formulation) or 5 Glucose or dextrose sweets ('Lucozade Energy ' or 'Dextro -Energy ' or 'Lift' ) or 60ml Lift Glucose Juice Shot (formerly Glucojuice) glucose tube (Glucogel) has 10g of carb.

Hypo Treatment & LTI: Some treatment is available on the LTI scheme - keep up to date with same - see Appendix on Entitlements for more information on the LTI. Hypo guidance for people with type 2 diabetes: The Discover Diabetes -Type 2 Handbook includes information for people with diabetes at risk of a hypo that is i n line with the current guidelines . This 3 page in formation is being prepared as a resource to be available for all 1 -1 and DSME and will be made available in the support folder when ready. Further information on Glucojuice - rebranded to Lift Glucose Juice Shot in 2019 Glucojuice: in an email from Diabetes Ireland sent on 3rd April 2019, they advised that Glucojuice is a product more recently available on the Irish market. It contains 15g glucose in 60ml making it an ideal hypoglycaemia management option. Glucojuice contains 57 calories and is free from gluten, caffeine, artificial colouring, preservative and sweetener see https://www.gogluco.co.uk/juice/ for further information. Lift Glucose Juice Shot: in an email from Diabetes Ireland sent on 28th May 2019, it advised that Glucojuice will be relau nching under the new brand name Lift. New product images will be available in early 2019. The only thing that is changing is the nam e. ALL PIP codes, EAN's and pack configurations are staying the same. It can now be prescribed and is available for people w ith diabetes under the Long Term Illness Scheme. This is because it is classed as a supportive requirement at a reasonable cost to manage hypos. It is also available as an \"over the counter\" product from pharmacy outlets at a cost of \u20ac1.99. People with di abetes can claim tax relief on this cost as part of their health expense annual return to Revenue or via www.revenue.ie . ID: It is recommended to carry a form of identity such as engraved jewellery (necklace or bracelet). Identity bracelets are avail able from Diabetes Ireland www.diabetes.ie/shop and most local pharmacies. ICE (In Cas e of Emergency) : People can add 'ICE' and the name of the person to be contacted in the case of an emergency to their mobile e.g. ICE Mary. If they are involved in an accident or taken ill, this allows the medical personnel to check their mobile phone an d contact this emergency contact. On a smartphone, there may be a \u00ab Medical ID \u00bb where you can store the name and number of your emergency contact. An ICE card is an emergency card for a wallet or purse that contains the names and numbers of emergency co ntacts plus important medical information. Diabetes Ireland (DI) has teamed up with Irish ICE Cards to increase the number of people carrying these cards. The cost is \u20ac20 or 2 for \u20ac25. \u20ac5 is donated to DI for every card sold. The card can be ordered by completing a form, online or phone ICE Card helpline on 087 -9777011 (days, evening, weekends). Contact : Connie Danaher, Irish ICE Cards, Killimer, Kilrush, Co. Clare. Email : conniedanaher@gmail.com or www.irishicecard.ie . Flyers are available to people with diabetes at 1 -1 clinics or courses. 46 DRIVING GUIDANCE The RSA Medical to Fitness Guidelines were updated in August 2019 from April 2019 a nd are available in the support folder on hypos and driving - print chapter 4 for guidance on diabetes. https://www.ndls.ie/images/PDF_Document s/Slainte_agus_Tiomaint_Medical_Fitness_to_Drive_Guidelines.pdf People taking diabetes medicine s which put them at risk of hypoglycaemia (insulin or sulphonylurea tablets) must take extra precautions and must inform the National Driver Licence Service (NDLS). There is no need to notify the NDLS if diabetes is managed by diet alone, or by medicine s which do not carry a risk of inducing hypoglycaemia , unless diabetic eye prpblems occur, affecting visual acuity or visual field. Please see folder for further reading on driving and diabetes. Resource: The Diabetes and Driving leaflet to support people with diabetes has been updated ( dated April 2017) and is available in the support folder on Hypos and Driving. Since March 2019, it is available to order directly online from the RSA by setting up a health care professional account with them. Practical Driving Guidance for People with Diabetes at risk of hypoglycaemia: For those at risk of hypoglycaemia: o Always CARRY your glucose meter and blood glucose strips with you. o You must CHECK your blood glucose BEFORE driving and EVERY two hours whilst driving. o IMPORTANT - Please make sure that your meter displays the correct TIME and DATE so that you have a record. o Also, always CARRY personal identification to show that you hav e diabetes in case of injury in a road traffic accident. o If your blood glucose is 5.0 mmol/l or less, have a snack. If it is less than 4.0 mmol/l or you feel hypoglycaemic, do not drive. Take appropriate action. Retest to ensure your blood glucose is above 5.1 mmol/l. o If you develop hypoglycaemia while driving, 1. STOP your vehicle as soon as possible. 2. SWITCH OFF the engine, take the keys out of the ignition, and move from the driver's seat. 3. DO NOT DRIVE again until 45 minutes after your blood glucose lev el has returned to normal. It takes up to 45 minutes for the brain to recover fully. o KEEP an emergency supply of fast -acting carbohydrate, such as glucose tablets or sweets, within easy reach in your vehicle. o Always take regular meals, snacks and rest periods at least every two hours on long journeys. o Always avoid alcohol. Car insurance: When diagnosed with diabetes an individual must inform their motor insurance company . Not informing your motor insurance may mean you are at risk of driving without insurance and poses risk of non -coverage in the event of an accident. The insurance federation has agreed not to load premiums for diabetes. Diabetes Ireland is in partnership with ZURIC H and ERM Financial Services offering competitive motor insurance c over.

ILLNESS - SICK DAY GUIDANCE Evidence The Model of Integrated care (2018) has included illness/sick days as one of the topics that should be covered by the practice nurse during the initial and review consultation with person with Type 2 diabetes. It is also included as one of the topics to be c overed by the Dietitian over a series of ses sions, depending on the per son's needs. The ICGP (2016) recommend that sick days are a key self- care issue to be covered with a p erson as part of structured education programmes. In terms of guidance specifics, current available references are from the ADA 2019 and guidance from Diabetes & Primary Care in 2018 . There is no guidance in Diabetes UK 2018 regarding illness management/ sick day guidance and there are no recommendations for DKA. Guidance The following summarises current guidance. Any condition leading to the deteriora tion in glycaemic control necessitates more frequent monitoring of bloo d glucose: people with diabetes prone to ketosis also require urine or blood ketone monitoring. If accompanied by ketosis, vomiting, or alteration in the level of consciousness, marked hyperglycaemia requires temporary adjustment of the treatment regime and immediate interaction with the diabetes care team. The people with diabetes treated with noninsulin therapies or medical nutrition therapy alone may require insulin . Adequate fluid and caloric intake must be ensured. Infection or dehydration is more likely to necessitate hospitalisation of the person with the diabetes than t he person without the diabetes (ADA, 2019). Diabetic ketoacidosis occurs in type 1 Diabetes and can occur in t ype 2 diabetes at times of severe illness or, rarely , in those on SGLT2 inhibitor therapy. It requires urgent hospital admission. Signs of diabetic ketoacidosis include excessive thirst, poly uria, dehydration; shortness of breath and laboured breathing, ab dominal pain, leg cramps, nausea and vomiting, mental confusion and drowsiness, ketones can be detected on the person's breath or in the blood or urine (Diabetes & Primary Care, 2018). Hyperosmolar hyperglycaemias state (HHS) is potentially life threatening and requires urgent admission to hospital. Signs of HHS include disorientation or confusion, polyuria, thirst and dry mouth, nausea and are typically seen after several days with gl ucose levels consistently about 30mmols/L (Diabetes & Primary Care 2018). The aims of managing a person with diabetes during intercurrent illness are to: Manage blood glucose levels Ensure adequate calorie intake and hydration with fluid replacement Test for and manage (if present) ketones Recog nise when further medical attention required (Diabetes & Primary Care 2018) Please note if a person is being treated for type 2 diabetes with insulin, education on ketone testing during illness may nee d to be considered depending on the individual needs of the client. General Guidelines during Illness Diabetes medicine taken as prescribed . Blood glucose levels should be checked more frequently if testing at home . Eat normally when possible and keep hydrated by sipping on water and sugar free fluids . If you are on insulin or tablets that have the potential to cause hypos and you are unable to eat it is important to avoid hypos by tak ing carbohydrates in fluid form. Visit your GP if necessary. Talk to your pharmacist about suitable cold/flu remedies . Seek medical help if in any doubt or: Your glucose levels remain high >15mmols/l You are unable to eat You are vomiting of unable to keep fluids down Your temperature remains high Your glucose levels persist low -below 4mmols/L Reference: Living well with Type 2 Diabetes, Diabetes Ireland (2016) As of September 2020, 'guidance for sick days' for people with type 2 diabetes is currently being updated by the National Clinical Programme for Diabetes. HSE website information is available at: https://www2.hse.ie/conditions/coronavirus/diabetes -and-coronavirus.html 48 13. LANGUAGE Evidence: Diabetes Australia published their position statement in 2011 (Speight et al, 2012) , followed by the UK adapting this work in the NHS England 'Language Matters ' document in 2018 (Cooper et al, 2018) . The US made recommendations in 2017 (Dickinson et al, 2017) on the use of language in diabetes care and education and in 2018 (Dicksinson, 2018) explored people's experience with diabetes related language . Further reading and information is provided in the fo lder on Language in the support folder which includes these references. A summary table discussing the words to consider and avoid using is available for reference. Language in Diabetes Care and Education Attention to language is now considered to be very important for all diabetes care health care professionals to reflect on, with recommendations to use informative, empowering and an educational style. Words are immediately shaped into meanings when people hear or read them , and those meanings can affect how a person views him or herself. (Dickinson et al, 2017). A person's experience of diabetes can influence their self -talk for example 'I am a bad diabetic '. This can influence movement towards behaviour change, which ca n be supported with positive self -talk. Attention is advised in the language used by health care professionals when working WITH people with diabetes, when describing people with diabetes and their current diabetes status in the development of literat ure used to support their care and in professional audiences. Attention to language is now recognised as key to providing person centred care (ADA , 2019). 5 key consensus recommendations re use of language include (Dickinson et al, 2017 ) 1. Neutral, non-judgemental, based on fact, actions, physiology or biology 2. Free from stigma - for example using non -compliant 3. Strength based, respectful, inclusive and imparts hope 4. Foste rs collaboration between people with diabete s and providers 5. Is person centred - person with diabetes, no longer using 'diabetic' The use of empowering language can help to inform and motivate yet language that shames and judges may undermine this effort. 49 14. MEDICINES A support folder on Medicines supports this section. Practical points to educate and support clients with include Ensure people KNOW if they are taking medicine to treat diabetes, the name and brand How to take medicines - when to take, the amount/dose, how to take (e.g. with/without food/water) Possible side effects especially risk of hypo and thus be informed on hypo guidance and driving guidance Be aware of possible side effects To discuss unpleasant side effects with their diabetes team and any self -adjusted alterations to the dose If not taking medicines as presc ribed, it may not be possible to assess its effectiveness as part of treatment review - inform their diabetes team of any changes they make in taking medicines. For advice, questions, concerns, talk to GP, PN, DNS, local pharmacist. The American Diabet es Association (ADA) and the European Association for the study of Diabetes published 'Management of Hyperglycaemia in Type 2 Diabetes' in 2018. Please see key guidance in Appendix 1 and 2 in support folder on Medicine s. Appendix 1 describes their new consensus approach to glucose lowering with medicine s in type 2 diabetes. The major change from previous guidelines is based on new evidence from cardiovascular outcome trials showing sodium -glucose co-transporter 2 -1) receptor agonists improve cardiovascular outcomes as well as secondary outcomes such as heart failure and progres sion of renal disease in people with diabete s with established CVD or CKD. Appendix 2 provides a list of glucose -lowering medicine s and therapies available and specific characteristics that may guide individualized treatment choices in non -pregnant adults with type 2 diabetes. Vitamin B12 is recommended to be checked annu ally for those treated with met formin - see Appendix on Dietary recommendations - section on micronutrients. Appendix 3 My Medicines List (HSE, 2019) . Encourage poeple to complete and carry with them. KNOW that you are using, the right medicine, the right way, CHECK your medicines and keep a list, ASK your healthcare professional if you're unsure . In 2019, t he HSE National Quality Improvement Team 'National Medication Safety Programme' developed this leaflet to support people with using their medici nes. The leaflet is in the support folder and can be downloaded from www.safermeds.ie and through local pharmacies. The campaign was launched in July 2019 with circulars to all HSE staff in September to be part o f the campaign and participate in World Patient Safety Day on 17th September. (Appendix 6). A support for health care professionals was made available in Sept. 2019 - key messages for people promoting Know, Check, Ask (Appendix 7) The use of the word 'medi cines' instead of 'medications' was recommended following their work in developing this leaflet. A website www.safermeds.ie is available for health care professionals and the public with lots of information and video s for support. This team are currently addressing the WHO 5 moments for medication safety and how to incorporate same into the current message. The SPE course handbook of the HSE Discover Diabetes - Type 2 course, includes a copy of the leaflet in addit ion to guidance on the long term illness scheme. It is proposed to make this available as a resource to support Type 2 Diabetes. Appendix 4 World Health Organisation's 5 Moments for Medication Safety . When starting a medication, taking a medication, adding in a new medication, reviewing medication and stopping medication. Appendix 5 Fish oil supplements & Medication - Guidance from Pharmacists on interactions of fish oil supplements with medicine is available in the Medicine folder. See Hypoglycaemia section if risk o f hypoglycaemia with medicines prescribed. If experiencing any problems or unpleasant side effects to discuss with GP to consider review and if alternative available. See Diabetes Remission section for information regarding medic ine adjustment for low -carbohydrate diets. See Entitlements section for information on the Long Term Illness Book (LTI) to support people with their entitlements for free medicines. 50 15. MINORITY ETHNIC GROUPS and supporting cultural needs Our culture is suc h an integral part of our life and often we are unaware of its influence on our thinking, behaviour, attitudes, which can lead to difficulties when we communicate and support those from other cultures (Gable, 2007). Ireland today is a multicu ltural societ y and dietitians need to cons ider how services can meet people's diabetes care needs. Attention to how we communicate can help. Consider social rituals, appropriate introductions, names (how to pronounce, write), explaining your role and purpose, if others attend the appropriateness of what is discussed, use of language, boundaries, cultural specific non -verbals, talking about food. Many cultures have customs associated with food that may be based on moral values, health, social, religious or spirit ual needs. Customs around food preparation, cooking and eating are many and varied (Gable, 2007). Culturally appropriate health education is more effective than usual health education to people from ethnic minority groups. The following points should be considered for 1:1 and/or group interventions: o Face-to-face interventions are more effective than tele -communication o A combination , of both group and individual education sessions , is likely to have the greatest effect in most ethnic minority groups. o Teac hing/counselling of activity change using culturally appropriate activities e.g. dancing and walking. o Attendance of family member to elicit home based support. o Use of visual aids to tailor low literacy needs. (DUK 2018) HSE Interpreter Service: It is imp ortant to consider how to support an individual's need and how to support those that wish to attend group or 1 -1 and if a combination of care may work best. There are various arrangements through the HSE for sourcing and booking interpreters. Obtain appro val from your manager to book an interpreter, link with local interpreter agency as per HSE areas service level agreement to arrange face to face or telephone service you require. Dietitians can reduce language barriers by improving their cultural competency, addressing health literacy, and ensuring communic ation with language assistance (ADA 2018) . See resources section for additional information. Special considerations - Ramadan: Those people with T ype 2 Diabetes classified in the very high and high risk groups are being advised not to fast which includes; people with sustained poor glycaemic control including severe hypoglycaemia, hyperosmolar hyperglycaemic coma or unexplained ketoacidosis within 3 months prior to Ramadan. people with a history of recurrent hypoglycaemia and/or unawareness, acute illness, people with CKD stage 3 or higher , advanced macrovascular complications and/or comorbid conditions that present additional risk factors. people receiving treatment with drugs that may affect cognitive function including multiple dose or premix insulin therapy Elderly with ill health. People taking sulphonylureas or insulin will need to make adjustments to dose and/or timings to reduce the risk o f hypoglycaemia and SMBG is recommended. Fasting should be interrupted if BG values are under 3.9mmol/l or above 16.7. Newer GLD including basal insulin analogs are associated with a lower risk of hypoglycaemia and may be pref erable for using during Ramad an (IDF 2017) . Structured education programmes should provide advice relating to diet, activity and medicine management during fasting to reduce the risks of acute complications and to lessen weight gain. (DUK 2018) Resources: Diabetes UK - provide resources in other languages and diabetes books e.g. Carbs and Cals World Foods Ireland: \"Self Care for People with Diabetes\" in different languages to include: Chinese, French, Polish, Romanian, Russian is NO LONGER UP TO DATE (Personal Communication, Diabetes Ireland May 2019). Additional information to support dietitians in 1:1 & DSME is available in the following document \"HSE, Minority Ethnic Groups: A Nutrition Resource for Dietitians & Heal th Professional s\" January 2010. HSE Emergency Multilingual Aid s have been developed to enable healthcare professionals to ask direct questions using the se aids to further supp ort their consultation with different ethnic minority group s. https://www.hse.ie /services/ema HSE Health Services Intercultural Guide : responding to the needs of diverse religious communities and cultures in healthcare setting (April 2009) - provides guidance on food and content of medicine relevant for each. https://www.hse.ie/eng/services/publications/socialinclusion/interculturalguide/interculturalguide.html HSE Guidance and support - https://www.hse.ie/eng/about/who/primarycare/socialinclusion/intercultural -health/ Intercultural he 2018 -2023, provides a comprehensive and integrate d approach to addressing the many unique, health and support needs experienced by the increasing numbers of HSE service users from diverse ethnic and cultural backgrounds and who live in Ireland. With over 200 languages spoken in Ireland, this support s understanding where people are coming from. 51 16. OBESITY, OVERWEIGH T & WEIGHT MANAGEMENT 1. CLINICAL ASSESSMENT Carry out anthropometrical measurement (in agreement with the person ); weight, height, BMI. BMI cut off points are slightly different for Asian, Ethnic South and Central American populations due to a higher risk of Cardiovascular disease and Type 2 Diabetes at lower levels of BMI. (SIGN 2010, NICE 2012, NICE 2013) Measur e waist circumference (WC) , as appropriat e (for those with BMI 35kg/m2). Apart from the identification of cardiovascular risk, WC can identify the degree of fat accumulation in the liver and pancreas, which drives the development of Type 2 Diabetes in many cases ( Taylor et al, 2005) . Addressing WC has the ability to improve glycaemic control and the potential to induce Diabetes remission in a proportion of people with Type 2 Diabetes Of note, BMI is not an accurate predicator of the degree of adiposity in older people (65yrs) due to reduction in body height and changes in body composition during aging (ESPEN 2018, IDF 2013). There is increasing evidence that in terms of metabolic risk, mortality, cardiovascular and function, the distribution of body fat may be more important th an the amount per se (ESPEN 2018). In such people there is an increased value is using waist circumference as a measure of risk (in BMI 35kg/m2) . BMI Waist circumference cut off points White European & Sub -Saharan African populations Men 94cm (37inches) Women 80cm (31.5inches) Asian, Ethnic South & Central American populations Men 90cm (35inches) Women 80cm (31.5inches) For overweight or obese adults with Type 2 Diabetes, reducing energy intake to achieve weight loss should be the primary nutritional management strategy (DUK, 2018). Weight loss of 5% or more significantly improves HbA1 c, total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, triglycerides, blood pressure and insulin sensitivity. 2. GUIDANCE Appro aches to weight loss should be individualised . It is the degree of consistency of behaviour change that predicts the outcome of weight loss rather than the type of dietary strategy. People should be supported in following the approach that suits their p references and lifestyle best and that they are most likely to adhere to (DUK, 2018). Diets that provide the same caloric restriction but differ in protein, carbohydrate an d fat content are equally effective in achieving weight loss (ADA, 2019). Interve ntions should be high intensity and focus on diet, physical activity and behavioural strategies to achieve a 500 - 750kcal/day energy deficit. People should be encouraged to practice self-monitoring techniques , including recording of weight, food intake an d physical activity to increase their likelihood of maintaining weight loss. Long term support and follow up of people who achieve short term weight loss should be available to ensure it is maintained. The importance of the long term maintenance of behaviours employed in the weight loss phase should be discussed fr om the outset so that the person clearly understands that if such behaviours are not sustained, there is a strong likelihood of weight regain. For those who are motivated to address their weight as part of their overall d iabetes management, weight loss expectations should be discussed. Unrealistic expectations result in a loss of motivation and lead to unsatisfactory outcomes if not addr essed from the outset . The initial goal of weight management is to stop the trajectory of further weight gain (NICE, 2014). For some people , avoidance of further weight gain will be an appropriate target. White European & Sub -Saharan African populations Asian, Ethnic South & Central American populations Description Less than 18.5kg/m2 Less than 18.5kg/m2 underweight 18.5 -24.9kg/m2 25-29.9kg/m2 23-27.5kg/m2 Increased risk 30kg/m2 27.5kg/m2 High risk 52 Degree of weight loss required What works ~5% Modified macronutrient profile Healthy eating Mediterranean diet 10-15% Multicomponent lifestyle interventions (high intensity) Partial meal replacements >15% Very low energy diets (<800kcals/day) Total meal replacements (800 -1200kcals/day) Approximate values only - devised by Cathy Breen, 2018 Weight management for those over 60 years of age For those over 60 years of age , who are overweight, avoidance of weight gain may be considered a success ( Model of Integrated care 2018 ) If weight loss is to be considered in ol der overweight or obese people (age 65+), it must only be done after careful weighing of the risks and benefits. If considered, o there should only be a moderate energy restriction (~500 kcal/d less than estimated needs and maintaining a minim um intake of 1000 -1200 kcal/ d) o targeting a weight loss of 0.25 -1 kg/week (~5 -10% of initial body weight after six months or more) and o assuring a protein intake of at least 1 g/kg BW/d and o an appropriate intake of micronutrients o combined with physical exercise where possible o to bring about a slow weight loss in order to preserve lean body mass. Weight loss, whether intentional or not, enhances the age -related loss of muscle mass, and consequently increases the risk of sarcopenia, frailty, functional decline, fractures and malnut rition. Strict dietary regimens, like diets with very low energy intake (<1000 kcal/day), are strongly discouraged in the older popul ation due to the risk of developing malnutrition and promoting functional decline (ESPEN, 2018). 53 3. DIABETES REMISSION Definitions Partial remission - Hyperglycemia below diagnostic thresholds for diabetes of at least 1 year's duration with no active pharmacologic therapy or on-going procedures Complete remission - normal glycemic measures of at least 1 year's duration with no active pharmacologic therapy or ongoing procedures Prolonged remission - Complete remission of at least 5 years' duration (ADA, 2009) Buse et al, Diabetes Care, 2009 Complete remission can be achieved with significant weight loss (~15kg) , with the effects being more pronounced earlier in the disease . Individuals who have diabetes of longer duration should be supported in their weight loss efforts however if this is something they wish to pursue. The concept of a \"personal fat threshold\" should be expl ored with people of lower BMI s. This offers the hope that even at lower levels of BM I, weight loss can result in nor moglycaemia in a certain cohort of people . People with recent onset Type 2 Diabetes could regain normal glucose c ontrol and normal \u00df -cell function when the fat content of the liver and pancreas is reduced by weight loss (Lim et al, 2011, Taylor, 2013) . Type 2 Diabetes is a clinical consequence of the accumulation of excess weight in ectopic sit es by susceptible indiv iduals ( Steven et al, 2016) . Recent work done in the DIRECT trial showed that with a 12 week total diet replacement programme of ~800kcals per day , followed by a structured food reintroductio n and regular follow in people with 6year duration of Type 2 Dia betes up resulted in 46% of participants achieving and maintaining complete Diabetes remission after 1 year, and 36% mai ntaining remission at 2 years. (Lean et al, 2019) . Achieving and maintaining weight loss is the dominant factor behind remission of Typ e 2 Diabetes, and as with other studies weight loss maintenance remains a challenge . People require on-going support to help them achieve and maintain weight loss. Of note not all people who achieve 15kg weight loss will achieve remission. Work on this trial demonstrates that of those who maintained a 15kg weight loss at 1 year 86% achieved complete remission . Of those who maintained this weight loss at 2 years 70% remained in remission (Lean et al, 2019). The key is maintenance of the 15k g weight loss. Remission in the DIRECT study was considered having an A1c below 48mmol/mol (6.5%) without diabetes medicine . Results at 12months showed that: Those who lost 5kg had approximately a 1 in 3 chance of remission Those who lost 10 -15kg, had ab out a 1 in 2 chance of remission Those who lost 15kg or more, had nearly a 9 in 10 chance of remission If people wish to pu rsue such interventions, they should be supported in doing so in a safe and collaborative way. They should be advised to also seek the support of their GP or DNS to aid in the adjustment of medicine s which may be required with major alterations in their n utritional intake and also with weight loss. Note: not everyone is suitable for the diet e.g. those with active or previous history of disordered eating, not medically stable, reduced kidney function, at risk of malnutrition. It is important to consider t he individual's microvascular complications before embarking upon major dietary change. If there is no retinopathy, or only early changes then no additional precaution is required other than an annual screening. However, if moderate or more severe retinopa thy is present then arrangements should be made to re -screen the eyes within six months of achieving a substantial improvement in blood glucose control. The reason for this is that the sudden normalisation (reduction ) in retinal blood flow associated with the return of normal blood glucose control can disadvantage areas of the retina in areas of marginal circulation with resulting deterioration in retinopathy. This effect is entirely restricted to individuals with pre -existin g moderate or worse retinopathy (Arun CS, Pandit R, Taylor R. Diabetologia 2004). Further information: The Commu nity Nutrition and Dietetics SMES working group on weight management completed a review of evidence on Diabetes remission in 2018. International and national evidence was reviewed. A summary of this evidence (as an excel workbook) and all key papers are available for all. The Discover Diabetes - Type 2 course includes summary guidance on the implicatio ns of this research to people with diabetes. It is proposed to make this avai lable as guidance for all 1 -1/SMES . - Roy Taylor and Mike Lean https://www.directclinicaltrial.org.uk/ https://www.ncl .ac.uk/magres/research/diabetes/reversal/#publicinformation and Info for Doctors (2020) and papers 54 17. OLDER ADULTS Older Adults are generally defined according to a range of characteristics including: chronological age, change in social role and changes in functional abilities. Most developed world countries have accepted the chronological age of 65 years as a definition of 'elder ly' or older person (WHO, 2002). Diabetes UK 2018 guidelines referenced below have not defined what they classify as an older adult. ADA 2019 and ESPEN 2018 guidelines have classified older adults as 65+ years of age. The IDF, 2013 have classified older adults as 70+ years of age. Refer to self -management education Diabetes self -management education and on-going diabetes self -management support are vital components of diabetes care for older adults and their caregivers (ADA, 2019). Age should not restrict access to structured education and self -management, as education has been shown to be effective in older adults (Diabetes UK, 2018). Self-management knowledge and skills should be reassessed if an individual's functional abilities diminish or when regimen changes are made (ADA, 2019). Please see Appendix on Self Management Education on Support for additional information. Nutrition and Physical Activity Guidance There is some evidence that the older person with diabetes may have poorer nutritional status than those without DM, both in community and hospital (Diabetes UK, 2018). Diabetes in the aging population is associated with reduced muscle strength, poor muscle quality and accelerated loss of muscle mass, resulting in sarcopenia. Inadequate nu tritional intake , in particular inadequate intake of protein, can increase the risk of sarcopenia and frailty in older adults. Diabetes is recognized as an independent risk factor for frailty, optimal nutrition with adequate protein in combination with ae robic and resistance exercise are crucial in the management of frailty in older population diagnosed with diabetes (ADA 2019). Older people with diabetes should be routinely screened for malnutrition with a validated tool in order to identify those with (risk of) malnutrition. (ESPEN, 2018). Assessment of nutritional status and nutrition support for those who maybe malnourished should be available to all older adults with diabetes and overseen by a dietitian (Diabetes UK, 2018). Malnutrition and risk of malnutrition in older people with diabetes should be managed according to the recommendations for malnourished older persons without diabetes mellitus (ESPEN, 2018). An older adult residing in an long term care facility may have irregular and unpredictable meal consumption, undernutrition, anorexia, and impaired swallowing. Furthermore, therapeutic diets may inadvertently lead to decreased food intake and contribute to unintentional weight loss and undernutrit ion. Diets tailored to a person 's culture, preferences, and personal goals may increase quality of life, satisfaction with meals, and nutrition status (ADA, 2019) . People with diabetes residing in long -term care facilities need careful assessment to establish glycaemic goals and to make appropriate choices of glucose -lowering agents based on their clinical and functional status (ADA, 2019). Diabetes education should be considered for the staff of long -term care facilities to improve the management of older adults with diabetes (ADA, 2019). To decre ase the risk of malnutrition developing in older pe rsons with diabetes ESPEN 2018 guidelines recommend to avoid restrictive diets . In case of obesity and weight management in older people with diabetes please refer to respective recommendations in the Appendix on Obesity/weight management. Nutritional management of older adults with diabetes should be person centred and individual For additional relevant or other supportive information, see Appendices e.g. - Dietary recommendations for adults with type 2 diabetes - Physical activity - Clinical Targets - Psychosocial care & support for diabetes, including Stress Evidence - The above guidance is taken from recent recommendations from ADA, 2019, Diabetes UK, 2018 and ESPEN, 2018 guidelines. FURTHER READING - OLDER ADULTS: In addition to these guidelines above further guidance is provided by ESPEN 2018 for adults 65+ years of a ge, see below Table 1 . Also, the International Diabetes Federation (IDF) developed global guidelines for managing older people , classified as those 70+ years of age diagnosed with Type 2 Diabetes in 2013. In these guidelines three main categories, namely general, functional independent, functionally dependent were developed for older people diagnosed with diabetes as a basis for clinical decision making. Please see below for a detailed explanation of each category (Table 2) and a summary of these nutritional guidelines in Table 3 and exercise guidelines in Table 4. 55 Table 1 : Summary of recommendations 54 - 60 from ESPEN guideline on clinical nutrition and hydration in geriatrics (classified as 65+), (ESPEN 2018) Recommendation Grade of recommendation GPP strong consensus (% agreement) 54 In overweight older persons weight -reducing diets shall be avoided in order to prevent loss of muscle mass and accompanying functional declin e. 95% Commentary Experts generally agree that there is usually no need for overweight older people to lose weight as meta -analyses indicate that mortality risk of healthy older people is lowest in the overweight range. Further, weight loss, whether intentional or not, enhances the age-related loss of muscle mass, and consequently increases the risk of sarcopenia, frailty, functional decline, fractures and malnutrition. Moreover, the common weight regain after a weight -reducing diet is predominantly a regain in fat mass and not in l ean mass. Thus, repeated phases of weight loss and regain, called \"weight cycling\", might contribute to the development of sarcopenic obesity (the presence of reduced muscle mass together with excess fat mass). Therefore, and to avoid a progress to obesity , maintaining a stable body weight is considered desirable for overweight older adults. A combination of a balanced, nutrient -rich diet providing adequate amounts of energy and protein, and physical activity, if possible even exercise, is a sound strategy to keep weight stable and to prevent obesity. 55 In obese older persons with weight -related health problems, weight -reducing diets shall only be considered after careful and individual weighing of benefits and risks 100% Commentary Obesity, especially severe obesity (BMI 35 kg/m2), increases metabolic and cardiovascular risk as well as the risk of mobility limitations and frailty in older persons, particularly when marked muscle loss has already occurred. Current expert recommendatio ns regarding weight reduction in older people primarily refer to cases of obesity that are associated with comorbidities and obesity -related adverse health effects. In these cases, positive effects of intended weight loss on orthopaedic problems, cardiovas cular and metabolic risk, insulin sensitivity, chronic inflammation and functional limitations have been reported, partly in combination with physical exercise. On the other hand, as weight loss in older persons may have harmful effects due to the loss of lean mass (see commentary to recommendation 54), the decision for or against weight reduction shall always be taken at the individual level. It should be based on a careful weighing of possible risks and benefits of the intervention considering functional resources, metabol ic risk, comorbidities, person's perspective and priorities, and estimated effects on his or her quality of life. If decision is made against weight reduction, it is advisable to aim at weight stability and avoidance of further aggravatio n of obesity. 56 If weight reduction is considered in obese older persons, energy restriction shall be only moderate in order to achieve a slow weight reduction and preserve muscle mass . 95% Commentary If weight reduction is considered to be beneficial, it has to be approached with great care . Interventions working in young adults cannot simply be extrapolated to older populations with low muscle mass and frailty. To avoid loss of muscle mass and to ach ieve a slow weight reduction in older persons, the dietary intervention should consist of a balanced diet as generally recommended for older adults, with a maximally moderate caloric restriction (~500 kcal/d less than estimated needs and maintaining a mini mum intake of 1000 -1200 kcal/d) targeting a weight loss of 0.25 - 1 kg/week (~5 -10% of initial body weight after six months or more) and assuring a protein intake of at least 1 g/kg BW/d and an appropriate intake of micronutrients. Strict dietary regimens, l ike diets with very low energy intake (<1000 kcal/day), are 56 strongly discouraged in the older population due to the risk of developing malnutrition and promoting functional decline. 57 If weight reduction is considered in obese older persons, dietary int erventions shall be combined with physical exercise whenever possible in order to preserve muscle mass. 100% Summary of commentary As it is of utmost importance for obese older persons to avoid loss of muscle mass while losing their excess fat mass, dietary interventions shall be combined with structured, supervised physical exercise whenever possible, in addition to an increase in ev eryday physical activity. Before starting an exercise intervention, health status and physical performance level of the person with diabetes need s to be evaluated to exclude contraindications for exercise training and to identify the optimal starting level and exercise type in order to ensure a safe and successful training. 58 Older people with diabetes mellitus shall routinely be screened for malnutrition with a validated tool in order to identify those with (risk of) malnutrition . 95% 59 In older people with diabetes mellitus restrictive diets shall be avoided in order to prevent malnutrition and accompanying functional decline. 100% 60 Malnutrition and risk o f malnutrition in older people with diabetes mellitus shall be managed according to the r ecommendations for malnourished older persons without diabetes mellitus. 100% Commentary to recommendations 58 -60 To decrease the risk of malnutrition developing in older persons with diabetes we recommend to avoid restrictive diets. These diets have lim ited benefits and can lead to nutrient deficiencies . In case of o besity in older people diabetes we refer to the respective recommendations provided elsewhere in this guideline (see recommendations 55 -57). In case of malnutrition in an old er person with diabetes we recommend to follow the sam e guidelines as for older adults without diabetes . The use of oral nutritional supplements or use of tube feeding can result in a rise of the glucose levels. However, prevention and treatment of malnutrition with its probable negative short -term outcomes are regarded more important than possible long -term complications of hyperglycemia. Table 2: International diabetes federation managing older people with Type 2 Diabetes global guidelines - Functional categories of older people with Diabetes (classified as those 70+ years of age) (IDF, 2013). GENERAL General guidance in specific clinical areas where it is expected that certain minimum standards of care should apply irrespective of age, co -morbid status, and presence of particular issues such as frailty or dementia CATEGORY 1: FUNCTIONALLY INDEPENDENT This category is characterized by people who are living independently, have no important impairments of activities of daily living (ADL), and who are receiving none or minimal caregiver support. Although diabetes may be the main medical problem, this categ ory includes those who have other medical co -morbidities which may influence diabetes care. CATEGORY 2: FUNCTIONALLY DEPENDENT This category represents those individuals who, due to loss of function, have impairments of ADL such as bathing, dressing, o r personal care. This increases the likelihood of requiring additional medical and social care. Such individuals living in the community are at particular risk of admission to a care (nursing) home. This category includes a range of functionally dependent older people with diabetes. Two grou ps require special consideration: 57 Subcategory A: Frail These individuals are characterized by a combination of significant fatigue, recent weight loss, severe restriction in mobili ty and strength, increased propensity to falls, and increased risk of institutionalization. Frailty is a recognized condition and accounts for up to 25% of older people with diabetes. Subcategory B: Dementia Individuals in this sub -category have a degree of cognitive impairment that has led to significant memory problems, a degree of disorientation, or a change in personality, and who now are unable to self -care. Many will be relatively physically well. Recommendations in both these sub -categories reflect the emphasis on person safety, poor self -management ability, high risk of and susceptibility to hypoglycaemia and unacceptable hyperglycaemia and their consequences, changing glycaemic goals, higher risk of hospitalization, housebound or aged care home environment, and reduced life expectancy. Recommendations may include relaxing glycaemic goals, simplifying regimens, use of low -risk glucose lowering agents, providing family/person education, and enhanced communication strategies. Table 3: Nutrition recommendations - International Diabetes Federation managing older people w ith typ e 2 diabetes (classified as those 70+years of age ), global guidelines (IDF, 2013 ) Recommendation on NUTRITION General All older people should have a nutritional and biochemical assessment at diagnosis, on admission to an aged care home, and as part of the annual review. The nutrition plan should be individualized and consider the person's food preferences, eating routines, religion and culture, and physical and cognitive health status. The meal plan should include a variety of foods to ensure essential vitamins, minerals, protein, and fibre are consumed in adequate amounts. Medicine administration times must coincide with meal times if the individual is on insulin or sulph onylureas to reduce the risk of hypoglycaemia. People with swallowing difficulties should be identified and referred to a speech therapist if available Functionally independent Functionally independent people with diabetes should be encouraged and assisted to achieve and maintain a healthy body weight. A consistent amount of carbohydrate should be provided at each meal. The meal plan can include sugar in moderate amounts but excess sugar, soft drinks and fruit juices should be avoided. Functionally dependent Encourage the consumption of adequate amounts of fluid to avoid dehydration especially in hot weather. Education and training are essential to enable healthcare professionals and caregivers to provide nutritional support. Sub-category A: Frail The nutritional assessment should be used to identify the presence of mal nutrition and/or weight loss and the appropriate nutritional plan to be adopted. Higher protein and higher energy intake foods may be needed to improve nutritional and functional status in frail older people with diabetes. Sub-category B: Dementia Healthcare professionals and caregivers should identify actual and potential eating difficulties. Caregivers should provide support at mealtimes to ensure that agitation is managed and meals are consumed . End of life Feeding tubes or intravenous (parenteral) nutrition may be needed to meet nutritional needs. The individual, family, and caregivers should be involved in decisions relating to nutritional support with respect of advance 58 directive and ethical issues. Additional Commentary While weigh t, BMI, and waist circumference should be documented as part of overall risk assessment, the institution of weight loss programmes in older people should be carefully considered not only because of limited data with regard to improving outcomes, but also b ecause of concerns about potential harms of weight reduction Table 4: Exercise recommendations - International Diabetes Federation managing older people with type 2 diabetes (classified as those 70+years of age ), global guidelines (IDF, 2013) Recommendation on EXERCISE General Older people with diabetes should be encouraged to be as active as their health and functional status allow. A risk assessment should be undertaken before recommending an activity programme. Timing and type of activity s hould be considered in relation to the medicine regimen, especially glucose lowering agents associated with an increased risk of hypoglycaemia. Functionally independent Encourage functionally independent older people with diabetes to exercise to targets recommended for all adults with diabetes. (See Appendix on physical activity) Functionally dependent Encourage a low intensity home -based exercise programme to improve p hysical performance and maintain ADL and mobility. If available, a physiotherapist should be consulted to assist those who are housebound or confined to a bed or chair to undertake exercise to build arm and leg strength and flexibility. Sub-category A: Frail Provide light -resistance and balance training to improve physical performance, lower limb strength, and prevent further deterioration in functional status. Sub-category B: Dementia Educate family members and caregivers on the safest effective mainten ance exercises that individuals can undertake . End of life care Encourage some form of exercise consistent with the person's capability and health status 59 18. PHYSICAL ACTIVITY Physical activity & exercise have numerous benefits in type 2 diabetes includin g improving blood glucose , cardiovascular risk factors & well being. 1. Discuss Physical Activity and agree persona lised targets, bear in mind the National Physical Activity Plan (Healthy Ireland, 2016 ) on www.getirelandactive.ie and o ther guidelines, as appropriate. 2. Encourage structured exercise: The FITT principle (below) can be used as a guide to help determine the level and type of activity. For people who are sedentary the focus should be on establishing a regular pattern of low-moderate intensity activity before moving onto working towards increasing the duration of activity and finally if appropriate the intens ity of the exercise. 3. Encourage people to consider how long they spen d in sedentary behaviours in a day and/or over a week. 4. Encourage the client to increase activities of daily living. The FITT Principle (Model of Integrated Care, 2018) FREQUENCY 3-5 days per week. More frequent exercise is desirable, but care should be taken to first establish a regular exercise habit before recommending levels that may not be sustainable. INTENSITY to avoid musculoskeletal injuries and promote compliance, star t at a low to moderate intensity and gradually progress over the course of several weeks or months to more vigorous efforts (if desired by the person ). Emphasis should be on increasing duration rather than intensity, with the goal of optimising caloric exp enditure. TIME 30-60 minutes, using a gradual progression. Multiple short bouts (10 minutes) produce similar benefits as a single long bout of the same duration. TYPE low-impact activities (e.g. walking, cycling, low -impact aerobics, water exercise) th at are convenient, accessible, and perceiv ed as enjoyable by the person. Recent Evidence and Recommendations General Physical Activity guidelines for Adults in Ireland recommend 150 minutes or more of moderate intensity aerobic activity per week . More r ecently the ADA recommends that m ost adults with type 2 diabetes should engage in 150 minutes or more of moderate -vigorous intensity aerobic activity per week (can be done in bouts of 10 minutes), spread over at least 3 days/week, with no more than 2 conse cutive days without activity. Shorter durations (75mins/week) of vigorous intensity or interval training may be sufficient for younger and more physically fit individuals (ADA, 201 9). 2-3 sessions/week of resistance exercise on non -consecutiv e days is recommended (ADA, 2019 ). Older adults are recommended to participate in muscle strengthening, flexibility and balance training 2 -3 times/week (e.g. Yoga and tai chi) ( National Physical Activity Plan for Ireland, 2016; ADA, 2019 ). Daily sedentary behaviour should be reduced. Prolonged sitting should be interrupted every 30mins for blood glucose benefits particularly in adults with type 2 diabetes (ADA, 201 9). Physical activity or exercises in isolation are not effective strategies for weight loss unless 60m ins/day is undertaken. Evidence is conflicting as to whether a combination of diet and physical activity or exercise results in greater weight reduction than diet or activity alone. Independent of weight management, physical activity & exercise have numero us benefits (Diabetes UK 2018). Special considerations are required for individuals with CVD, uncontrolled retinopathy and severe neuropathy (Chapter 4, ADA 201 9). Studies show it is safe for individuals with Type 2 diabetes who are treated by diet alone or in conjunction with oral hypoglycaem ic agents, to exercise in both the fasting and post-meal state, with the most beneficial effects on blood glucose levels observed post-prandially when blood glucose levels have more potential to reduce (Diabetes UK, 2018) . For individu als treated with insulin or insulin secretago gues, care should be taken to minimise the impact of hypoglycaemia which can occur up to 24 hours after physical activity (Diabetes UK 2018). For individuals on these therapies (e.g. insuli n/ insulin secretagogues), added carb ohydrate should be ingested if pre-exercise glucose levels are <5.6mmol/l (ADA, 201 9).

PRE-PREGNANCY PLANNING A ND PREGNANCY CARE FO R WOMEN OF CHILD -BEARING AGE With increasing numbers of women around the world developing Type 2 diabetes and doing so at a younger age, and with women in many cultures tending to delay starting a family, the issue of Type 2 diabetes (T2DM) complicating pregnancy has become increasingly important. Diabetes is the most common medical problem in pregnant women and is associated with less satisfactory outcomes for the mother and infant when compared with people without diabetes , with an increased risk of congenital malformation, perinatal morbidity and mortality in the offspring. In type 2 diabetes the situation is made worse by the fact that the women are often older, more obese, of non -Caucasian background, are frequently of higher parity and are more likely to have chronic hypertension and be treated with medicine s associated with congenital abnormalities. (HSE, 2018) Planned pregnancies greatly facilitate preconception diabetes care (HSE, 2018) . To minimize the occurrence of congenital malformations, stand ard care for all women with type 2 diabetes who have chil dbearing potential should include: 1. Education about the risk of malformations associated with unplanned pregnancies and poor metabolic control , HbA1c target (less than 48mmol/l), blood glucose and testing targets and hypoglycaemia prevention and treatme nt. 2. Education on the use of effective contraception at all times, unless the person with diabetes is in good metabolic control ( i.e. HbA1c less than 48mmol/mol) and actively trying to conceive 3. The possibility of pregnancy should be discussed at each diabetes consultation 4. All women with diabetes who are contemplating pregnancy should be advised to plan their pregnancy and be referred to a secondary care diabetes centre. 5. Medical and diabetes review to include possible changes to diabetes medicine s / insulin, review of medicine s to avoid potentially teratogenic agents and to check for and treat possible complications of diabetes. 6. Women with diabetes in pregnancy should be offered care by a specialised diabetes obstetric multidisciplinary team (HSE, 2010) PRE-CONCEPTUAL CARE is associated with significantly improved pregnancy related outcomes, lower rate of congenital anomalies, earlier ante -natal booking with lower HbA1c at booking and reduced premature deliveries. Dietetic aims of Pre -Conceptual Care: 1. Optimise glycaemic control prior to conception HbA1c 2. Taking and continuing high dose folic acid (5mg) until the 12th week of pregnancy and 400micrograms thereafter. 3. Weight loss for women who have a BMI above 27kg/m2 to achieve an appropriate weight 4. Ensure the diet is well balanced to meet nutritional requirements for this life stage. 5. Education and action planning on lifestyle factors including regular physical activity, avoiding alcohol and smoking and appropriate food safety. CARE DURING PREGNANCY - If your client with type 2 diabetes presents to an appointment/SPE and informs you they are pregnant: 1. Support them to attend their GP, diabetes service and maternity service straight away. 2. Advise them take 5mg of folic acid each day for the first 12 weeks of pregnancy 3. All pregnant women in Ireland should take a supplement containing 10micrograms (400iu) Vitamin D per day in addition to inclusion of Vitamin D rich foods such as fortifi ed milk and oily fish. (HSE/Institute of Obstretricians & Gynaecologists, Nutrition During Pregnancy - Clinical Practice Guidelines Nov 2019). Of note, the majority of over the counter prenatal multivitamins contain 10 micrograms of Vitamin D3, therefore i f a woman chooses to take a prenatal vitamin she will not require additional Vitamin D supplementation. Women who choose a strict vegetarian or vegan diet are advised to take a supplement in form of ergocalcifero l (vitamin D2). Hyperglycaemia during preg nancy is associated with adverse outcomes and women with diabetes require MDT expertise to optimise glycaemic control. Recommendations include: Individualised dietary advice to promote adequate nutritional intake and achieve optimal glycaemia appropriate f or gestational age (HSE, 2010) Monitoring weight to ensure appropriate weight gain during pregnancy based on pre pregnancy BMI. Moderate physical activity of 30mins per day in uncomplicated pregnancies. Taking a vitamin D supplement (10micrograms) as reco mmended for all pregnant women. Alcohol - in Sept. 2019, the HSE launched a campaign on Foetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders advising no amount of alcohol at any stage of pregnancy is safe (See support folder for HSE staff communication) . RESOURCES: 1. A 2019 leaflet on Guidance on 'Pregnancy Planning and Diabetes', produced by the Irish Maternity Di etitians Gro up, is available in the support folder . 2. HSE website: Current link - https://www2.hse.ie/pregnancy/ and https://www2.hse.ie/my -child/ - it may be changed with developments. The HSE website on diabetes, due in 2020 , will address type 2 diabetes and pregnancy. 3. Curriculum Guidance for DSME diabetes courses . See support folder on Pregnancy. 61 20. PSYCHOSOCIAL CARE & SUPPORT FOR DIABETES, including STRESS EVIDENCE Diabetes has behavioural, psychological and social impacts and demands high levels of self -efficacy, resilience, perceived control and empowerment (Hendrieckx C, 2016). Managing the emotional and mental health impact of diabetes is now recognised as key to supporting a person to self -care for diabetes and to reduce the risk of complications. Emotional and mental health problems or psychological problems, such as diabetes distress and depression are common and associated with suboptimal self -management, diabetes related complications, reduced quality of life and increased health -care costs. Good psychological well -being and quality of life is an important outcome in its own right. Assessme nt of psyc hological (emotional well -being and mental health) and social situation should be included as an ongoing part of the medical management of diabetes (ADA 2019) as they can impair an individuals' or families ' ability to carry out diabetes care tasks and thus compromise health status . Working in a person centred way, using the e mpowerment approach and person centred active listening skills helps to discover areas that pose a challenge for people . The diabetes health care professional has an important role in discussing emotional and mental health concerns affecting those with diabetes. Guidelines to support clinicians have been lacking until the 2016 handbook publication on diabetes and emotional health by the Mental Health and Diabetes National Development Programme in Australia (Diabetes and Emotional Hea lth - a practical guide for healthcare professionals supporting adults with type 1 and type 2 diabetes ). These guidelines have been adapted by the NHS, UK in 2019. See the support folder for the NHS 2019 copy. It is recommended to consider the life course considerations associated with living with diabetes e.g. ADULTS (women of child bearing age, changes in family support, chronic pain, low socio -economic groups), OLDER ADULTS (mild cognitive impairment or dementia in those over 65y, needs of the old er adult). (ADA, 2016). Psychosocial care or health addresses 1) emotional health and well -being and 2) mental health. 1. Emotional health and well -being affected by diabetes can result in diabetes distress (DD) (also referred to as diabetes burnout whic h is more sustained distress) and require ongoing exploration for people with diabetes. Proposed to affect 1/6 people with non -insulin treated diabetes and 1/5 people with insulin treated diabetes. (Hendrieckx C, 2016). DAWN2 study reported significant DD was reported by 45% though only 24% reported that their health care teams asked them how diabetes affected their lives (ADA 2019). 2. Mental health conditions or psychological disorders include: anxiety, depression, disordered eating, serious mental ill ness, suicide risk and require evaluation . It is recommended older adults ( 65y) are screening for cognitive impairment and depression (ADA, 2019). Current evidence and guidance for further reading is available in support folder/Psychosocial Care & Support in '2019 Evidence Review Psychosocial care and Support' . SUPPORTING PSYCHOSOC IAL CARE AND SUPPORT IN CONSULTAT IONS AND SMES 1. Facing life with diabetes can be different for everyone, with different reactions to the diagnosis which can raise a range of emotions that will effect how a person will cope and self -manage. Listen and assist the person and assure them you can support them to live well with diab etes. Consider the questions you use to support asking a person how they are coping with the diagnosis. ( Hendrieckx et al , 2016). Asking how a person is coping with the diagnosis of diabetes. Here are some examples of open -ended questions you might use to enquire about how the person is coping with the news that they have diabetes: 'How are you feeling at the moment about the news that you have diabetes?' 'How did you react when you were told you had diabetes?' 'How do you feel your diabetes may impact on your [school/work/personal relationships/ family/sport/hobbies etc.]?' 'How do you feel about telling other people that you have diabetes?' 'How did your [close family members] react when you told them a bout the diagnosis?' 'How do you feel you are coping?' - 'What do you foresee will be the hardest thing for you in fitting diabetes into your life?' - 'What do you think will be easy for you to do/change?' - 'What do you think may be more difficult?' Acknowledging the daily challenges of living with diabetes and the efforts it takes to manage the condition can help people feel more comfortable about sharing their thoughts and feelings. You can do this by prefacing these op en-ended questions. For exampl e: 'Many of the people that I see find living with diabetes challenging' or 'Finding out you have diabetes can be a lot to take in' - comments like these 'normalise' the adjustment process and help the person to realise they are not alone in thinking or feeling this way. Explain that incorporating diabetes into their life takes time, for example, 'Living with and managing diabetes is a learning process, quite a bit can feel like 'trial and error'. Over time, you will become an expert in managing your dia betes'. 62 2. Consider and explore levels of copin g skills living with diabetes , irrespective of how long a person has diabetes for. Consider and explore day to day stresses . Informal verbal enquiries can assist assessment e.g. 'What is it about living with diabetes that you find most difficult and how does that make you feel? ' 'What are your greatest concerns about your diabetes? ' 'How is your diabetes getting in the way of other things in your life right now? ' Enquiring if there has been a change in mood during the past 2 weeks or since the last visit, when exploring barriers (new or different) to treatment and self -management such as feeling overwhelmed or stressed by diabetes or other life stressors. See table below (Hend rieckx et al , 2016 , ICGP 2016 , ADA 2019 ). 4. Be aware of potential risk of diabetes distress or more severe diabetes burnout vs. a current diagnosis or treatment for depression or potential risk of same. 5. Build emotional strength and reliance through working in a b ehavioural way and using person centred skills, taking every opportunity to build self -efficacy and use positive affirmations. Highlight any positive outcomes being achieved through any self - care effort - for example, attend ance at appointments/SMES is a positive. A person's perception about their ability or self - efficacy to self -manage is related to improved diabetes self -management and treatment outcomes (ADA 2019). 6. If stresses or diabetes distress are identified, discuss coping skills and stress management skills . Educating clients on the skill of problem solving to support self -care and addressing prior successes supports development of their coping skills. 7. Discuss the potential effects of stress on blood glucose and self -care tasks . (Polonsky, 1999) Stress can have a direct and immediate effect on blood glucose but only for certain people at certain times. There seems to be people who are stress insens itive, stress sensitive where blood glucose levels rise under stress and those whose blood glucose levels drop. Not a ll stressful situations cause blood glucose problems, most likely when one feels trapped or out of personal control. In summary, stress has the potential to interfere with diabetes self-care, w hich can elevate blood glucose and to influence blood glucose directly. The more distr essed you are the more likely blood glucose is likely to be affected. 8. Discuss stress management strategies used by clients or explore options. Have supporting literatu re available on stress management and diabetes distress . 9. If concerns identified, ask permission to discuss with GP . 10. Recognise when to refer and be aware of local services/support available to support coping skills, stress management and diabetes distress. 11. In 2019, this area will be investigated further regarding short psychosocial questionnaires that may be suitable for use by the dietitian with people with diabetes e.g. PAID -20 Stressors/barriers to self -care which may increase risk of diabetes distress or diabetes burnout may include: - New diagnosis of diabetes and associated fears of the condition and risk of complications, overwhelmed with treatment advice - Prospect or P resence of complications - associated fear, worry, anxiety, overwhelmed by all the appointments/tests - Presence of other co-existing illness e.g. CVD, Cancers, Respiratory illness, Sight issues - Attitudes and feelings - fear, denial, anxiety - Changes in medical status - diabetes or other medical conditions, need to intensify treatment - Personal issues - depression, poor coping style, eating disorders, lack of knowledge, inaccurate health beliefs, negative feelings about diabetes, fear and frustration about weight, unrealistic or unclear expectations about self -care - Other Family, social, financial, other life stressors/issues e.g. living conditions, finances, support (too much/too little), alcoh ol or drug abuse, relationship issues, family confused about self -care responsibilities, chronic life stress at home/work, poor relationship with GP/HCPs, competing priorities, unstructured life (e.g. shiftwork, unemployed, retired), stigma, discrimination, unhelpfu l reactions - Recent life events - Anxiety about diabetes care i.e. using insulin or injections, hypos management and risk, polypharmacy - Burden of daily self -care tasks 63 PSYCHOSOCIAL S UPPORTS : Consider the need to direct /support people with local services or literature - know referral pathways. Be aware of local HSE and community counselling and stress management services - link with services locally. On the 17/4/19, the HSE circulated information (by email) to All Users on the New National Directory of Mental Health Services (see belo w). Discuss within your team and with local diabetes care teams in acute and community services your recommendations for local support/service access e.g. HSE mental health departments (e.g. appointment access, WRAP training), HSE psychology department support the psychological well -being of people through individual and group based interventions (e.g. appointment access, courses on stress control, mindfulness), HSE National Counselling Service in Primary Care (CIPC) for medical card clients .

SLEEP The assessment of sleep pattern and duration should be considered; recent research found that poor sleep quality, short sleep , and long sleep were associated with higher A1c in people with Type 2 diabetes. As part of comprehensive management of people with Type 2 Diabetes, it is recommended that sleep behaviours are considered at initial, follow up and annual visits. Age adjusted rates of sleep obstructive sleep apnoea are a risk f actor in cardiovascular disease and are significantly higher with obesity, es pecially central obesity. The prevalence of Obstructive sleep apnoea in populations with Type 2 Diabetes may be as high as 23% and the prevale nce of any sleep -disordered breathing may be as high as 58%. (ADA 2019 ) 22.

This form of intensive support combined with drug treatments has the highest success rates. This service is usually free of charge and is run by health services. Smoking cessation advisors are specially trained to support you through the quitting process. You can attend smoking cessation clinics for one -to-one sessions that are tailored to meet your needs. They usually take place for 1 -4 weeks before your quit date and continue for up to one year after you quit. These sessions will: 1. look at your desire and readiness to quit, 2. take a history of your smoking habit, 3. assess your nicotine addiction, 4. identify your reasons for quitting and any difficulties or risk s of relapse, 5. create a personal plan for your quitting, 6. measure your carbon monoxide levels, 7. recommend suitable medical treatment, refer you to doctor for prescription and follow -up. Group support Group courses are usually six weeks long and meet once a week for about an hour. They are usually run by smoking cessation advisors and can be very effective. In the first session the members of the group introduce themselves, they review past atte mpts to quit, determine reasons for quitting and set a quit date for the group. At follow -up meetings, members discuss their progress, address any difficulties, swap coping tips, and encourage one another to stay quit. The advisors will measure each member's c arbon monoxide levels (before and after quitting), their leve l of nicotine addiction, and recommend medical treatment.

TRAVEL GUIDANCE & HOLIDAYS If a person is on insulin, the following checklist applies when travelling abroad; A letter on medical stationary stating you have diabetes and use insulin pens or pumps. A written prescription using generic medicine names and a copy of it in another bag or with a friend in case of theft/loss. Spare pens/insulin, extra glucose st rips, ketone tests if travelling for a long break. To always get the required vaccines if travelling further afield. Insulin Travel Wallets are the most convenient way to carry insulin - It is important that your insulin supplies are kept at the correct temperature. Diabetes Ireland stock Large Insulin travel wallet \u20ac25 or Extra Large \u20ac30. For more details/to order website -wallet/ or contact Elayne on 01 8428118. Travel Wallets can be sent out in regular post by An Post. Carry qu ick acting carbohydrate in the case of a hypo and advise your travel companion on what to do . Refer to Hypoglycaemia Appendix Alcohol may lower blood glucose so don't drink alcohol on an empty stomach and if you drink alcohol, eat some carbohydrate before going to bed . You should carry vital medicine and equipment in your hand luggage and Airport Police are aware of this, therefore you can ask for their assistance if you encounter difficulty at security . Drink plenty of water in a hot climate and paying the extra cost for air conditioning may be beneficial to help prevent night time glucose fluctuations. Insulin may be absorbed faster in warm climates, this may cause blood glucose levels to drop which may lead you to require less insulin. Blood glucose is me asured in mmol/L in Ireland but in mg/dl in many other countries for example in the Unites States. So if you need to contact a healthcare professional abroad, the conversion rate is 1mmol/L= 18mg/dl. e.g. 6 mmol/L= 108mg/dl . Travel Insurance: Ordinary hol iday insurance or backpackers insurance booked through your travel agent may not cover your diabetes. Read the small print. Diabetes is categorised as a 'pre -existing condition'. If you fall ill while abroad as a result of diabetes or the diabetes is deeme d to be aggravating the illness, an ordinary travel insurance policy will not cover it. ERM Brokers will quote you for Travel I nsurance covering Diabetes and we recommend getting a quote . Tel Grainne at ERM on 01 845 4361 (Diabetes Ireland 2019). EHIC (European Health Information Card) information : www.ehic.ie The card is covered under EU regulat ions only. So you can benefit f rom holding one only in EU/EEA countries. Hard Brexit obviously will affect it. But if there is agreement reached between UK and the EU - this might be covered in the agreement. If your pre -existing condition causes a medical emergency while travelling, the card will cover you. It is used in circumstances when you become ill or have an accident when travelling to another EU country for a short visit. More information can be obtain from Citizen's Information website under The European Health Information Card section; https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/travel_and_recreation/travel_abroad/european_health_insurance_card.html 69 RESOURCES A document is avai lable to support dietitians/educators and other health care professionals with key information on free diabetes resources for use with people with type 2 diabetes. It supports this section by providing links to relevant website and literature - see Suppor t folder/Resources. This has been updated in 2020. The health promotion website ( www.healthpromotion.ie ) is a great resource where health care professionals can log in and register as a health care professional and order resources to be used in clinic /groups. There is a wide range of resources available on various websites presented there. 70 REFERENCES INTRODUCTION & PHILOSOPHY OF CARE Anderson, R. (1987) Diabetes educators as philosophers.
