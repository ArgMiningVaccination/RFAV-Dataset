But while antihistamines can mitigate certain allergic reactions, they are not designed to prevent them. Experts have advised against taking vaccines unless one develops side-effects. But, \"if you're already on any medication at all, you should check with your local doctor, as some people may be advised to keep taking antihistamines for rashes and other allergic reactions,\" Professor Luke O'Neill, Chair of Biochemistry at Trinity College Dublin, was quoted as saying to Euronews. \"But there's no reason to start taking painkillers ahead of the vaccine, just in case they might limit vaccine efficacy,\" he added.
