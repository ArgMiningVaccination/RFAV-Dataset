Ongoing research grants & Contracts 2009{2014 Exploratory Center for the Elimination of Minority Health Disparities P 20 MD 003373-01 (PI: Schell), NIH/NCMHD Role : Co-investigator/Statistician The main role is to provide statistical advice and guidance in the Research & Training Cores of the Center for the Elimination of Minority Health Disparities. Speci cally, I am assisting with the development of statistical methods that analyze data relevant to accomplishing the goals of the Center. In addition, I am providing guidance on implementing sound statistical approaches for complexities associated with longitudinal data obtained from observational studies. Some of statistical methods on missing data (e.g. calibration) have been both motivated and funded by this Center grant. Project budget: $946,759 2014{2018 Persistent Organic Pollutants and Cognitive Elderly R01 ES022652-01 (PI:Fitzgerald), NIH/NIEHS Role: Co-Investigator The goal of the proposed research is to address research gaps concerning the& e ects of selected persistent organic pollutants (POPs) on the nervous system of older adults. Because it builds upon an existing project which collected cross-sectional data and proposes to follow-up the participants, it will provide a longitudinal evaluation of whether exposure to POPs is associated with changes in cognitive and motor function in older adults over time. 2Completed research grants & Contracts 2011{2012 Upstate Health Research Network Data Security Protocol for the Analysis of New York State Data. Fair Health Inc. and O\u000ece of the Attorney General, NY Project Title: Negative charges, Missing charges, Zero Charges Role: PI The main purpose of this project is to create a transparent public database for determining reimbursement rates for out-of-network care for a given geozip and medical procedure. My particular project focuses on the issue of missing/negative or zero charges. With funding from this agency, I will develop parametric and nonparametric techniques for producing rate tables in the presence of missing data. These techniques are based on the novel use of mixed-e ects models modi ed to re ect unique complexities such as non-nested and nested clustering. In addition, nonparametric techniques for missing data using calibration, resampling, and matching- based methods are used. I will also develop new parametric and non- parametric missing-data methods that rely on the strength gained from multiple data sources. Project Budget: $112,000 2011{2012 Upstate Health Research Network Data Security Protocol for the Analysis of New York State Data. Fair Health Inc. and O\u000ece of the Attorney General, NY. Project title : Representativeness of Ingenix claims data for NY State. Role: Co-investigator/Statistician This project develops computationally e\u000ecient Monte Carlo experiments to conduct tests on the representativeness of the datasets to be used by other investigators. Further develop re-weighting schemes to ensure representativeness, using propensity score matching algorithms. Tools and methods developed in the \\missing-data\" part of the project (see above) will also be used here. 2009{2010 Feasibility study of an alternative class of techniques for multiple imputation inference in realistically complex incomplete datasets. Junior researcher award, Center for Social and Demographic Analysis University at Albany. Role: PI The overall aim of this project is to conduct a feasibility study of sequential imputation using Bayesian sampling routines in complex data systems. Speci cally, a comprehensive real-data-based simulation study is conducted to assess the performance of a variable-by-variable approach in developing imputation models. These structures include but are not limited to nested and non-nested clustered structures with item nonresponse and clustered administrative data with multiple cluster membership. Project budget: $ 11,800 3Completed research grants & Contracts (Ctd.) 2008{2010 Augmenting NY Cancer Registry Data to Assess Breast and Colorectal Cancer Care. Centers for Disease Control and Sub-contract PI: Yucel) Role: Co-investigator/Statistician This project's principal aim is to bring diverse sources of data together to examine the quality of cancer care delivery, from early detection to survival. To accomplish this, a unique linkage was made among the New York State Cancer Registry, New York State Medicaid program, New York State Hospital Discharge-Ambulatory Surgery data system, and Medicare claims. My role is to devise sound, practical and objective methods on missing cancer stage data for the New York Cancer Registry. In addition, methods using missing-data and measurement error techniques are being implemented to draw overall statistical inferences from multiple data-sources. Subcontract budget: $ 41,024 2007{2009 Private Sector Workplace Equal Employment Opportunity Progress 1966-2004 National Science Foundation (PI: Tomaskevic-Devey) Role: Co-investigator The overarching goal of this project was to analyze more than ve million establishment-level, panel observations collected by the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission since 1966. The richness and complexity of these data required us to rst investigate unresolved but generally important analytic problems for modeling dynamic outcomes associated with long-term panel data with multiple non-hierarchical clustering. I developed the modeling framework for both maximum likelihood estimation and imputation that addressed these complexities (e.g. overlapping nesting, multiple memberships in dynamic data). Substantively, we examined the organizational change in in rms, industries, and local labor markets in the United States. Project budget: $151,000. 2008{2009 Infant Mortality, Black-White Disparities, State Social Policy Kellogg Foundation (PI: Robinson) Role: Consultant I developed estimates using multilevel models, causal models and modern missing data techniques on disparities in infant mortality. This project used multiple data sources including the National Vital Statistics System and National Maternal and Infant Health Survey. Project budget: $17,464 2006 Mixed Models for Finite Populations National Institute of Health (PI: Stanek) Role: Co-Investigator I introduced model-based routines for missing data and helped the PI adapting some of these methods to nite population settings. I also collaborated on the development of re-sampling-based missing-data methods. Project budget: $331,392 4Completed research grants & Contracts (Ctd.) 2006{2007 Methods for High Dimensional Data in HIV Research National Institute of Health (PI: Foulkes) Role: Consultant This project involved grouping individuals into genetic clusters, where individuals in the same cluster have similar or identical multilocus genotypes. I helped the formulation of the unobservable alignment of alleles within chromosomal copies as the missing-data problem in haplotype-based investigations. I also assisted in the development of estimation routines drawing upon multiple imputation in the mixed modeling setting, where cluster assignments are determined under a given probability distribution. Project budget: $956,670 2002{2004 Model-based approaches to item non-response in complex sample surveys and censuses. American Statistical Association and National Center for Health Statistics (PI: Yucel) Role: PI This project extended general multivariate imputation techniques to multivariate multilevel data which are of particular interest to survey practitioners. These newly-developed methods were applied to several large-scale health surveys, including the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey and the National Health Interview Survey. I also studied variable- by-variable imputation for clustered-data under maximum-likelihood-based 2003{2006 The public health of caregiving and disability. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (PI: Kuhlthau) Role: Co-investigator/Statistician I guided statistical analyses of survey data obtained under complex sample designs such as National Health Interview Survey, Medical Expenditure panel Survey, Behavioral Risk Surveillance System). I also devised appropriate Bayesian model- tting techniques for incomplete data. Project budget: $439,994 5Applications submitted but not yet funded \u000fStatistical methods for dynamic models using realistically complex data National Institutes of Health Challenge Grant Program (PI: Yucel) Role: PI This project proposes new statistical methodology for dynamic models that can deal with both substantive problems around multiple environmental and/or genetic associations and missing data. Dynamic models of gene- environment interaction resemble multiple membership models, conceptual- izing the actor (gene, person, organization) with the potential to develop be- haviors when confronted with environmental resources or the opposite which is to have the behavior blocked by environmental conditions. Main contri- bution to the statistical literature is the statistical methods on the missing data and mixed-e ects models for estimating dynamic models in social and/or epidemiological studies. Substantive contributions modeling dynamic change in workplace employment dynamics and its interaction with environmental factors and the novel use of mixed-e ects models for estimating genetic asso- ciation and gene-environment interaction studies on outcomes on colorectal adenoma and body mass index in studying cardiovascular disease. This project is currently being prepared for application for NSF and NIH funding. \u000fEnvironmental Disruptors of Ovulation in African American Women (Sub- mitted in June 2012) National Institutes of Health (PI: Bloom) Role: Co-Investigator \u000fImproving and CBPR (Sub- mitted in Jurkowski) Role: Co-Investigator \u000fSynergistic on Avoidable Hospital- izations (Submitted in May, (PI: Yuchi) Role: Co-Investigator \u000fHome Antenatal Environment, Maternal Exposures, and the Wellbeing of the Young (HARMONY) (Submitted in October, 2013) National Institutes of Health, NICHHD (PI: Choi) Role: Co-Investigator 6Publications in peer-reviewed journals Statistical methods publications (* indicates students or post-doctoral fellows under supervision; ** indicates equal authorship, *** indicates senior authorship) 1.Yucel, R.M.
