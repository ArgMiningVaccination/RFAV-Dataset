There is evidence of some rare, adverse effects related to vaccines, such as seizures, inflammation of the brain and fainting, but there is no evidence linking immunisation and autism. How can I find out what caused my child's autism? Currently, it is not possible to identify the exact cause of autism in most individuals, though there are a few genetic syndromes associated with the disorder. At this point, there is no evidence that specific chemicals in the environment, immunisation practices or dietary differences cause autism. My child may have autism, but I am not sure. How can I find out? The core features of autism are difficulties with social interaction and communication, presence of repetitive behaviours and limited interest. If you notice these behaviours, please speak to our doctors. Is there a cure for autism? There is no known or available 'cure' for autism, though, sometimes, parents of children with autism put a strong emphasis on the cure of autism. Homeopathy can help control the child's disturbing behaviour. It also helps in the development of the child's learning skills and improvement of concentration and motor skills. Homeopathic treatment not only manages the symptoms of autism but also plays a very important role in the child's integrated development. Are autistic people more likely to be violent or commit violent crimes than non-autistic people? No. In fact, recent studies showed that not only are autistic people unlikely to commit a violent crime, the rate of violence among autistics is lower than the general population. Autistic people are also far more likely to be the victims of crime than the perpetrators. How will homeopathy help my child with autism? As per research and clinical studies, homeopathic treatment is known to help an autistic child with development and improvement in behavioural and cognitive symptoms as well as concentration. Homeopathy can help the child improve their speech and motor skills. Ultimately, the treatment can transform an autistic child into a well-balanced, well-developed, happy individual. Myths and facts: - People with autism do not want friends. People with autism struggle with social skills, which may make it difficult for them to interact with their peers. They might seem shy or unfriendly, only because they are unable to communicate their desire for relationships the way others do. - People with autism cannot feel or express any emotion-happy or sad. Autism does not make an individual unable to feel the emotions you feel; it just makes the person communicate their emotions (and perceive your expressions) in different ways. - People with autism cannot understand the emotions of others. Autism often affects an individual's ability to understand unspoken interpersonal communication. So, someone with autism might not be able to detect sadness solely based on the other person's body language or, as the case may be, sarcasm in the other person's tone of voice. That said, when emotions are communicated more directly, people with autism are more likely to feel empathy and compassion for others. - People with autism are intellectually disabled. Often, autism comes with just as many exceptional abilities as limitations. Many people with autism have normal to high IQs, so much that some may even excel in mathematics, music or any other pursuit. - People who display qualities that may be typical of a person with autism are just odd, and will grow out of it. Autism stems from biological conditions that affect the brain's development and, for many individuals, it is a lifelong condition. - People with autism will have autism forever. Recent research has shown that children with autism can make enough improvement after intensive early intervention to 'test out' of the autism diagnosis. Thus, the given evidence reinforces the importance of addressing autism when the first signs appear. - Autism is just a brain disorder. Research has shown that many people with autism also have gastro-intestinal disorders, food sensitivities and many allergies. - Autism is caused by bad parenting. In the 1950s, a theory called the 'refrigerator mother hypothesis' arose, suggesting that autism was caused by mothers who lacked emotional warmth. This has long been disproved. - The prevalence of autism has been steadily decreasing for the past 40 years. The rate of autism has increased by 600% in the past 20 years. In 1975, an estimated 1 in every 1,500 individuals had autism. In 2009, an estimated 1 in 110 had an autism spectrum disorder. "}
