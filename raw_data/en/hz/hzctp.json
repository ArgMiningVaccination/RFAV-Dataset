The ACMSF is invited to: 1. Cons ider the comments received in response to the consultation, summarised in Annex 2, with key concerns relating to a shelf-life limitation of 5 days discussed in the attached paper 2. Consider the publication of the FSA document \"Guidance on the safety and shelf-life of vacuum and modified atmosphere packed chilled foods\", in the light of these key comments received through the consultation process. Secretariat November 2004GUIDANCE ON THE SAFETY AND SHELF-LIFE OF VACUUM AND MODIFIED ATMOSPHERE PACKED CHILLED FOODS WITH RESPECT TO PSYCHROTROPHIC C.BOTULINUM Issue 1. The ACMSF is invited to consider the publication of the FSA document \"Guidance on the safety and shelf-life of vacuum and modified atmosphere packed chilled foods\", in the light of the comments received through the consultation process. Background 2. The attached document (Annex 3) relates to the food safety aspects of the manufacture of vacuum and modified atmosphere packaged (VP/MAP) chilled foods. 3. The document is a concise summ ary of the information contained in the industry Code of Practice for the Manufacture of Vacuum and Modified Atmosphere Packaged Chilled Foods (1996) and advice from the Advisory Committee on the Microbiological Safety of Food (ACMSF) in its Report on Vacuum Packaging and Associated Processes (1992) and subsequently (1995). The document was drafted in response to a request made by the ACMSF to make the guidance more accessible and relevant to manufacturers and retailers of chilled VP/MAP foods, and Local Authorities carrying out their enforcement duties. At its meeting held on 18 September 2003, the Committee agreed that the document should go out to a full public consultation. The consultation period ended on 27 August 2004. Consultation comments 4. The c omments received in response to the consultation are summarised in Annex 2. 5. There was broad support for the document, especially from Environmental Health Officers. There were also major concerns, particularly from the manufacturing and retail sector, if the document was to be published in its current form. These concerns relate to a perceived change in the \"10-day rule\" and the introduction of a 5-day shelf-life for foods stored at 5 - 8 oC. The \"5-day rule\" is based on ACMSF advice that chilled foods stored between 5oC and 10oC should have an assigned shelf-life of 5 days or less, and the concern is that this advice is slightly at odds with the industry Code of Practice which recommends a shelf-life of 10 days or less for chilled foods where the specific controlling factors are not demonstrated. The attached Background Note (Annex 1) provides further detail on the 5-day shelf-life issue.. Industry concerns with a shelf-life limitation of 5 days 6. The chilled food industry has the following concerns with the introduction of a 5-day shelf-life limitation: It would have a very serious impact on the shelf-life of chilled foods since it would be unlikely that a temperature of less than 5oC could be maintained throughout the shelf-life, particularly when considering the period after customer purchase. This would give rise to a greatly increased amount of waste food It would have a significant effect on manufacturing and transport costs. It would become financially impossible to continue to produce many products, and the UK produced chilled market would reduce There is no evidence that the \"10-day rule\" has not been fully effective in food safety protection It lacks a transparent scientific basis. The 5-day recommendation of the ACMSF (1995) is not supported by referenced studies. This contrasts with the wealth of data and refereed publications considered during production of both the original ACMSF Report and the Industry Code Imposing such a restriction could be a barrier to trade and could put the UK chilled food industry at a distinct disadvantage against mainland Europe The new guidance would have a significant commercial impact and would require a Regulatory Impact Assessment to be carried out. Action required by ACMSF 7. In the light of these s erious concerns raised by the food industry, the ACMSF is invited to consider options for publishing the FSA guidance document. The options include: 1. Publishing the document in its current format thereby including the shelf-life limitation of 5 days 2. Revising the document so that it takes account of only the original ACMSF Report and the Industry Code (i.e. no reference is made to the additional ACMSF advice relating to the shelf-life limitation of 5 days) 3. Defer publication of the document and consider establishing a Working Group to revise advice in relation to the control of C.botulinum in VP/MAP chilled foods, taking account of previous advice and all subsequent evidence. Microbiological Safety Division November 2004Background Note Anne x 1 Why the guidance document includes a shelf-life limitation of 5 days at 5 - 8oC 1. One of the aims of the document was to bring together the 3 published pieces of advice in relation to the control of C.botulinum in VP/MAP foods; the industry Code of Practice (1996), the ACMSF Report (1992), and the ACMSF Annex to its 1995 Annual Report. 2. The industry Code and the ACMSF Report are consistent in terms of advising a shelf-life of 10 days or less for chilled foods where the specific controlling factors are not demonstrated or where the food has not been challenge tested to demonstrate a shelf-life longer than 10 days. However, they differ in that the ACMSF specifies a chill temperature of 10oC and the industry Code is more stringent in reducing the temperature to 8oC, in compliance to temperature control regulations. The ACMSF made its recommendation for the adoption of 10oC on the basis of proteolytic strains of C.botulinum (i.e. those that do not grow at chill temperatures) not being reported to grow below this temperature. But, in order to consolidate the advice, the current guidance document refers throughout to a chill temperature of \u00a38oC. 3. The Annex to the ACMSF Annual Report (1995) recommended that, \"where chilled storage is the sole controlling factor, chilled foods stored between 5oC and 10oC should have an assigned shelf-life of 5 days or less \". As the current guidance document refers throughout to a chill temperature of 8oC, this recommendation is interpreted as foods stored between 5oC and 8oC should have an assigned shelf-life of 5 days or less. This interpretation does not change the ACMSF recommendation that \" If a shelf-life of up to 10 days is required, the chilled storage temperature should be 5oC or less .\" 4. The Annex to the ACM SF Annual Report was a written response by the ACMSF to questions raised by the Technical Secretary to the Vacuum Packaging Code of Practice Working Party. The recommendation relating to the \"shelf-life of 5 days or less\" was in response to a question seeking the ACMSF's opinion on whether 10 days at 8oC is still adequate as a controlling factor in the light of recent data, or whether the current recommendation should be reviewed. The ACMSF's view was that there was no evidence to suggest that an assigned shelf-life of less than 10 days has not proven to be effective. However, since publication of the Report \"additional information from laboratory based studies has been published. Data available from Food MicroModel support the leading edge of this recently published information .\" It was in the light of this additional information that the ACMSF recommended that , \"where chilled storage is the sole controlling factor, chilled foods stored between 5oC and 10oC should have an assigned shelf-life of 5 days or less \".ANNEX 2 RESULTS OF THE PUBLIC CONSULTATION ON THE FSA'S DRAFT GUIDANCE ON THE SAFETY AND SHELF-LIFE OF VACUM AND MODIFIED ATMOSPHERE PACKED CHILLED FOODS WITH RESPECT TO PYSCHROTROPHIC C.BOTULINUM COMMENT ORGANISATION Overall Support for the document Respondents indicating broad support for the guidance documentSainsbury's Wakefield Council Alan Speight, Consultant Hams Council Weymouth & Portland Borough Council Cannot support current content or format CFA/BRC Uniq Prepared Foods NIMEA/ Dungannon Meats FDF Key Comments: Introduces a shelf-life limitation of 5 days Would have a very serious impact on the shelf life of chilled foods since it would be unlikely that a temperature of less than 5oC could be maintained throughout the shelf life, particularly when considering the period after customer purchase In order to maintain a 10-day shelf life they would need to ensure a temp of 5oC or less throughout life. This can be achieved during manufacture, distribution and retail sale but they would have to assume temperatures in the home by customers would exceed 5oC so they may be obliged to reduce all shelf lives to 5 days. Has a significant effect on manufacturing and transport costs A reduction in shelf life would cause severe distribution and stock management problems and potential losses through \"waste\" throughout the supply chain. This could result in removal of product ranges from the market to the detriment of consumer choice and business viability. Maintaining a temperature of 5oC or less will be technically difficult and may not be practicable when the Food Safety (Temperature Control) Regulations 1995 do not require it.

No evidence that the existing 10 day shelf life rule under the industry code is failing to keep food safe for consumersSainsbury's Northern Foods British Poultry Council FDF SeafishCurrent guidance given in Industry CoP including a shelf life of 10 days at a temp of 8oC is still fully valid without amendment. This view is given with the understanding that all of the existing literature was reviewed and taken into consideration during the production of the Industry Code, that there has been no comprehensive review of any research done since the Code was published, but the with knowledge that we have seen no evidence that implementation of the control factors in the Industry CoP has resulted in food safety issues with respect to C. botulinum. Express concern about experimental data used as a basis for the FSA guidance. Challenge tests on real products and under realistic storage conditions have not shown unsafe levels in the time periods set. Suggest that the FSA request a further review of the risk presented using the most recent data and a more thorough assessment of scientific basis underpinning the guidance.

Also suggestion of secondary title: \"Guidance for Food Business Managers and Enforcement Officers\"IFR Some smoked seafood and meat processors are unaware of the risk of C. botulinum . Believe the only way to change this is through enforcement of industry code of practice by EHO'sInverawe SmokehousesWhere cooked meats are packed in bulk and supplied to a re-wrapper do both companies have to do challenge testing or predictive testing? Or is it just the re-wrapper who handles the food last before it is sent for retail sale? Local authorities have to consider who has responsibilities before taking any sort of enforcement action. The guidance must clearly describe the biochemical effects on control factors of different foods.Wakefield Council The need to challenge test even when there is a good safety record for the product is noted and the clarity welcomed, however it seems likely that the application of the advice would be challenged in court and in weighing up the chances of success authorities may conclude that pursuing the matter is not a sensible course of action. There is therefore the risk that the guidance would then gradually be discredited.LACORS Emphasis should be on policing the existing Industry Code so that manufacturers and packers work to that standard which is widely accepted by the industry and enforcement authorities as representing a safe standard.British Poultry Council The guidance does not deal with the issue of failures in the cold chain. It may be appropriate to advise on CCPs and documentation of specified temperatures.Herefordshire and Worcestershire Food Group The guidance could mention the need to register changes in food business registration such as the introduction of vac-packing. Should the postal exemption in General Regulations be reviewed?Herefordshire and Worcestershire Food Group The guidance seems to assume the existence of a chill chain beyond that specified in the Food Safety (Temperature Control) Regulations 1995 or the design criteria for a standard retail display or domestic fridge.Northern Foods Further shelf life comments Recommendations citing 3-8oC could lead less enlightened processors to believe that food should be held only between 3-8oC whereas storage closer to 0oC would enhance the shelf life and safety of products; particularly with reference to L. monocytogenes. Guidelines from SFIA recommend storage at 0-2oC for fish.Donald C Cann Some manufacturers put long shelf life on products with the proviso that they are kept at or below 3oC. This is impractical.Milton Keynes Council The proposed change could unfairly discriminate against meat processors in Northern Scotland and Northern Ireland where long transport distances are an issue.NIMEA/ Dungannon MeatsCOMMENT ORGANISATION Suggestions for widening the scope of the guidance The USA Federal Drugs Administration Food code criteria for food businesses that use reduced oxygen packing are more stringent than the FSA draft. Suggests the FSA draft should be more prescriptive and make detailed reference to HACCP, in particular the need to challenge test or carry out predictive modelling in the context of HACCP.Wakefield Council Suggestion that vacuum packing is included in the HACCP training given to butchers.Calderdale Council The FSA guidance should give more emphasis to the fact that the safe use of these packaging methods is dependent on those who use them understanding and constantly maintaining the correct procedure. Users should be referred to the key issues as given in the Industry Code of Practice:- training of food handlers, risk assessment, monitoring of control points, product formulation, temperature control, definition of product life, hygiene and the prevention of cross-contamination.Tom Miller, Food Regulatory Affairs Consultant The guidance should emphasise that if intending to use >10 day rule, special training and advice will almost certainly be required. Ideally the proprietor should be required/advised to notify the Local Authority.Herefordshire and Worcestershire Food Group Advice on whether the risk is great enough to require thermographic cooking records to verify 90oC would be valuable.Herefordshire and Worcestershire Food Group The guidance needs to include advice on small businesses repackaging previously vacuum packed items into smaller units and assigning the same or possibly different date marking advice. The acceptability or otherwise of this practice needs to be covered and reference made to the need to recognise additional CCPs.LACORS Herefordshire and Worcestershire Food Group Rhondda Cynon Taf Council It would be very helpful if the guidance could include generic HACCP plans for VP products, eg a suggested plan for VP raw meat and VP cooked meat.Dick Dailley, EHO, Carmarthenshire Asks for more \"pre-worked vegetables and raw meat.David Bardwell, EHO, West Wiltshire.

This could be through local authorities to help raise awareness and to target particular known premises, through trade associations, through publicly accessible website(s), and to those selling new or dealing in second hand vacuum packing equipment.LACORS Challenge testing The FSA should make a clear statement if they believe that predictive tools alone can be used to determine product safety for MAP/VP products that do not meet specific controlling factors, or if they believe that a challenge test must also be done.CCFRA BMPA A new final para should be added to read: \"If a shelf-life of >5-10 days at >5-8oC is desired (for example 10 days at 8oC), then the specific controlling factors will need to be demonstrated, and challenge test studies should be carried out.\"IFR Society for General Microbiology Small manufacturers could find the cost of challenge testing prohibitive.BMPA Milton Keynes Council SFAM NIMEA/ Dungannon Meats British Poultry Council Farne Salmon and Trout Ltd Could CCFRA share information they have on challenge testing?

They suggest that many common scenarios will be very similar and it might be possible to give some standard advice linked to particular proven \"worked examples\" for different common food scenarios to avoid the need for similar/identical challenge tests needing to be repeated throughout the UK. Such advice might be developed with industry and enforcers as part of the Safer Food Better Business project being lead by the Agency's HACCP team.LACORSCOMMENT ORGANISATION What is Clostridium botulinum ?

This could be made clear in the \"who should use\" paragraph. If aimed at smaller businesses it could include guidance on controlling other pathogens, for example preventing cross contamination between packing raw and ready to eat foods.NI Food Liaison Group The guidance should consider advice to the final user.

It combines the effect of heat treatment and of inhibitory factors. A heat treatment at 90oC for 10 minutes combined with subsequent maintenance at 8oC for 40 days provides a protection factor of 6, ie this combination reduces the probability of survival and growth from spores of C. botulinum by a factor of 106, a 6-log reduction.

AFDOS in the US have suggested another controlling factor: the introduction of non-competing (harmless to humans) organisms to compete against the growth of pathogenic organisms which do harm.British Poultry CouncilAnnex 3 Guidance on the safety and shelf-life of vacuum and modified atmosphere packed chilled foods January 2004 (DRAFT)Introduction This document provides advice on vacuum and modified atmosphere packaged (VP/MAP) chilled foods in relation to microbiological safety and shelf-life limitations and Clostridium botulinum . The process of vacuum packaging removes air and prevents its return by an airtight seal of the food within the packaging material. With modified atmosphere or \"gas\" packaging, air is again removed and is replaced by a strictly controlled mixture of gases chosen from carbon dioxide, oxygen and nitrogen. There are various methods available to replace air in VP or MAP foods which are described in detail in the Industry Code of Practice for the Manufacture of Vacuum and Modified Atmosphere Packaged Chilled Foods1. Although VP/MAP techniques can protect food products from external contamination and increase the shelf-life, under certain circumstances a bacterium called Clostridium botulinum may grow. As this bacterium prefers to grow without air, VP/MAP products are more at risk . Some strains of C.botulinum are able to grow and produce toxin at low temperatures and therefore it is very important that these products are kept under controlled refrigeration. Although this type of food poisoning is very rare in the UK, its serious nature means that VP/MAP should be carefully controlled. It is very important that all critical control points are identified and controlled at all times. What is Clostridium botulinum ? Clostridium botulinum is a spore-forming, anaerobic bacterium - meaning it only grows in the absence of oxygen. This bacterium can produce a very powerful toxin in the food which causes botulism - a frequently fatal form of food poisoning. Botulinum toxin is one of the most potent substances known, causing the serious paralytic illness botulism, which can result in death if not treated promptly. The spores are widely distributed in the environment, are found world-wide in soil, dust and marine sediments and are generally considered to survive indefinitely. The toxin is produced when the spores are able to germinate in favourable oxygen-free environments that allow the bacteria to grow and release toxin. As the organism can only grow in the absence of oxygen, foodborne botulism is usually associated with airtight foods such as canned or bottled foods which have not been processed sufficiently to either remove the spores or prevent bacterial growth. Home canned foods in particular, and foods preserved in oil 1 Campden and Chorleywood Food Research Association. Guideline No 11: A Code of Practice for the Manufacture of Vacuum and Modified Atmosphere Packaged Chilled Foods; May 1996.(e.g. garlic in oil), have been associated with outbreaks. Outbreaks of botulism have also been associated with VP/MAP foods, the most commonly implicated food being smoked fish. What does this guide cover? The microbiological safety concerns summarised here will be restricted to the control of C.botulinum strains which are able to grow and produce toxin at chill temperatures ( psychrotrophic). Mesophilic C.botulinum is not considered a risk with respect to VP/MAP chilled foods as it does not grow below 10oC. However, both organisms may cause safety problems if the foods are stored above 10oC, as the controlling factors may not be adequate. In general, ambient stable heat processed foods rely on a different set of controlling factors than VP/MAP chilled foods and take into account the potential for growth and toxin production by psychrotrophic and mesophilic C. botulinum. Recommendations covering these products are contained in the Department of Health Guidelines on Heat Preserved Foods2. Although this document is restricted to the safety concerns with respect to C.botulinum , Table 1 summarises the conditions permitting growth of other food poisoning bacteria of potential concern with chilled VP/MAP foods. This document summarises the advice of the Advisory Committee on the Microbiological Safety of Food's (ACMSF) Report on Vacuum Packaging and Associated Processes3, ACMSF advice annexed in its annual report4 and the Industry Code of Practice for the Manufacture of Vacuum and Modified Atmosphere Packaged Chilled Foods5. The ACMSF advice and Code of Practice remain valid; this guidance document supplements that advice. Who should use this guidance document? The guidance is recommended for use by manufacturers and retailers of chilled VP/MAP foods. It is designed to meet the needs of all levels of expertise, from technical managers in large enterprises to individuals vacuum packing products for market stall trade. The guidance is also designed to help Local Authorities carrying out their enforcement duties. The aim is to help Environmental Health Officers and businesses become more aware of the steps they need to take to control C. botulinum in VP/MAP foods. 2 Department of Health.

Guideline No 11: A Code of Practice for the Manufacture of Vacuum and Modified Atmosphere Packaged Chilled Foods; May 1996.Determination of the Safety of Chilled VP/MAP Foods The shelf-life of a chilled VP/MAP food (i.e. one held at 3-8oC) should never exceed 10 days unless its safety under expected storage conditions can be demonstrated. In order to determine whether a chilled VP/MAP food is safe and to determine when challenge testing is appropriate, the 3-Step Principle in Figure 1 should be followed. These principles are also outlined in the flow chart in Figure 2.Figure 1. Determination of the safety of chilled VP/MAP foods: The 3-Step Principle Step 1: Determine whether the shelf-life of the chilled food is: Short, i.e. \u00a3 10 days \u00ea Go to Step 2 or Long, i.e. > 10 days \u00ea Go to Step 3 Step 2: Determine whether the product is chilled at: 3 - 5oC \u00ea Products do not have any specific requirements with respect to C.botulinum . The maximum shelf-life allowed is 10 days. or >5 - 8oC \u00ea Products do not have any specific requirements with respect to C.botulinum . The ACMSF advise a maximum shelf-life of 5 days or reduce the storage temperature to below 5oC for a maximum shelf-life of 10 days2. Step 3: Determine whether, in combination with storage at \u00a38oC, one or more of the following specific controlling factors are demonstrated; if not, the product should be challenge tested: minimum heat treatment of 90oC for 10 minutes or equivalent lethality pH of 5 or less throughout the food a minimum salt level of 3.5% (aqueous) throughout the food an aw of 0.97 or lower throughout the food a combination of heat and preservation factors which has been shown to consistently prevent growth and toxin production by psychrotrophic C.botulinumFigure 2.

The maximum shelf-life allowed is 10 days.Products do not have any specific requirements with respect to C.botulinum . The ACMSF advise a maximum shelf-life of 5 days or reduce the storage temperature to below 5oC for the maximum shelf-life allowed of 10 days2When to Challenge Test To establish the potential risk from growth and toxin production by C.botulinum in chilled VP/MAP foods with a long shelf-life (>10 days) which do not meet the specific controlling factors, challenge test studies should be carried out; direct microbiological testing for the organism in a product is inappropriate. Where the specific controlling factors have not been demonstrated, a good safety record for the product cannot be relied upon; challenge testing must be carried out . Where the specific controlling factors (see Figure 1, Step 3) have not been demonstrated and where there is no challenge test data to show that psychrotrophic C.botulinum will not grow in the food within the specified shelf-life, then the shelf-life of the food should be reduced to \u00a310 days (or the specific control factors detailed in Figure 1 implemented) . Due to the nature of the hazard, challenge testing must be conducted in research facilities with the necessary expertise to safely handle the organism. The procedure involves inoculation of the product with, in this case, C.botulinum spores which are able to germinate and grow at chill temperatures, and incubation of the product under controlled environmental conditions in order to assess the risk of food poisoning or to establish product stability. The risks associated with the product can be determined using predictive microbiological models, e.g. Food MicroModel, ComBase (http://wyndmoor.arserrc.gov/combase/) . Modelling can be used as a tool to guide the need for challenge testing. Troubleshooting The industry Code of Practice3 outlines types of problems that may occur during manufacture, storage, distribution and handling of VP/MAP foods and provides advice on possible scenarios which may be encountered. If you are a manufacturer, retailer or Environmental Health Officer and you are in any doubt about the safety of a VP/MAP food, you should contact the Food Standards Agency. The Agency will put you in contact with expert advisors as necessary.

No. 28 July 1991, Appendix 1 revised April 1997ANNEX Background Information on the Specific Controlling Factors In an unpreserved VP/MAP food stored at chill temperature, growth of C.botulinum or Listeria monocytogenes will be slow. Under normal conditions it is assumed that the food is contaminated unless there is a specific step (e.g. pasteurisation for L.monocytogenes ) which removes this possibility. It is on this basis that specific requirements for shelf-life are proposed to assure the safety of food, even though some limited growth of the food poisoning organism may be possible. Table 1 gives some data on the minimum growth requirements and suitable heat treatments for food poisoning organisms of potential concern to chilled VP/MAP foods. Heat Treatment For VP/MAP with a shelf-life of greater than 10 days at chill temperatures \u00a38oC, where there are no other controlling factors, the minimum heat treatment required is that the slowest heating part of the food should be held at 90oC for 10 minutes or equivalent; equivalent temperatures are shown in Table 2. NB: A heat treatment of 90oC for 10 minutes (or equivalent) in combination with storage at 8oC will give a protection factor of 6 with respect to spores of psychrotrophic C.botulinum7. (This is a 6 log reduction, which will reduce the numbers of microorganisms present by a factor of 106. This is traditionally expressed as a \"6D\" value where D is the time required at a given temperature to reduce the number of viable cells or spores of a given microorganism to 10% of the initial number.) Acidity of the Food The level of acid in a food is a controlling factor in the growth of microorganisms and a pH of 5.0 or below throughout a food stored at chill temperatures \u00a38oC is sufficient to inhibit the growth of psychrotrophic C.botulinum . NB: The pH of some multicomponent foods may vary within the product due to diffusion and mixing limitations and if pH is the controlling factor for safety a pH of 5.0 or below should be met throughout the food. This should be monitored for every production batch. Acidified foods containing meat, fats or oils are notoriously difficult to acidify uniformly and extra care should be taken with these foods . 5 For long shelf-life foods (>40 days) stored at chill temperature 8oC, research published since publication of the ACMSF advice1, 2 and Industry Code of Practice3 suggests that in addition to a heat treatment of 90oC for 10 minutes (or equivalent, see Table 2), challenge testing may be needed to establish the maximum shelf-life.Salt Content A level of 3.5% salt throughout the aqueous phase of a food stored at chill temperatures \u00a38oC is sufficient to inhibit the growth of psychrotrophic C.botulinum8. The percentage of salt in the aqueous phase of a product can be calculated from the salt content (grams of NaCl present in 100g product) and the moisture content (grams of water per 100g of product) using the following calculation: NaCl content NaCl content + moisture content x 100 NB: If salt content is the controlling factor for safety, a level of 3.5% or above should be met throughout the aqueous phase of a food. This should be monitored for every production batch. Water Activity ( aw) Using water binding chemicals such as salt or sugar it is possible to remove the available water from a food to a point at which the growth of microorganisms is inhibited. For foods with salt or other solutes as the main aw depressant, an aw of 0.97 should be achieved throughout the food stored at chill temperatures \u00a38oC to inhibit the growth of psychrotrophic C.botulinum . NB: The aw of some multicomponent foods may vary within the product and if aw is the controlling factor for safety, an aw of 0.97 or below should be met throughout the food. This should be monitored for every production batch. Due to the nature of the test it may be necessary to approach a specialised laboratory to do aw measurements and to interpret the data. Combination of Factors Combinations of a lower level of the specific controlling factors described above may be able to prevent growth of psychrotrophic C.botulinum . Where a lower level of factors is used, each factor is not able to inhibit the growth of C.botulinum on its own but is reliant on the combined effect of all factors. NB: These specific combinations need to be established using sound scientific principles; this is a highly specialised field and expert advice is needed. Mathematical models (e.g. Food MicroModel) can be used to obtain relevant information on controlling factors such as salt and pH. It is necessary to illustrate that the preservation system chosen can consistently prevent growth and toxin production by psychrotrophic C.botulinum : this may be done by challenge testing and possibly predictive models , providing that sufficient validation data are available to substantiate the reliability of predictions. 8 For long shelf-life foods (>40 days) stored at chill temperature 8oC, higher salt levels may be required to inhibit psychrotrophic C.botulinum and challenge tests may need to be conducted.
