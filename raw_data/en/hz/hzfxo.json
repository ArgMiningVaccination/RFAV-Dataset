Program Organization Career and Technology Studies / 7 Alberta Education, Alberta, Canada (2009) MEETING THE DIVERSE NEEDS OF ALBERTA'S STUDENTS Alberta schools include students from a rich variety of backgrounds. T hese students have a wide range of abilities and needs. Like all school programs, the CTS program has been developed with this diversity in mind. Teachers and instructors should be aware of the individual needs of their students and adapt their instruction and programming accordingly. First Nations, M\u00e9tis and Inuit (FNMI) Students FNMI students in northern and western Canada come from diverse geographic areas with varied cultur al and linguistic backgrounds. Teachers and instructors need to understand the diversity of these students' cul tures and experiences. They also need to understand that there are values and cultural traditions shared amongst many Aboriginal Canadians, including the importance of family and the role of Elders in guiding and supporting young people. FNMI students often have a holistic view of learning\u2014they look for connections through experiential learning. Such connections can be made within the real -world, experiential CTS program. Traditionally, in FNMI cultures, little emphasis was placed upon the written wor d. Still today, oral communication and practical applications and experiences are important to student learning and understanding. A variety of teaching and assessment strategies can help build upon the diverse knowledge, cultures, communication styles, skills, attitudes, experiences and learning styles of FNMI students. English as a Second Language or French as a Second Language Students Immigrants to Alberta come from many different cultural and linguistic backgrounds. Many of these new arrivals become students in Alberta schools, yet their knowledge of English or French may be minimal. Some students who have lived in Canada their entire lives may also be learning to speak English or French as a second (or third) language . The variety of teaching and assessment strategies that can be used in the CTS program may help build upon the diverse knowledge, cultures, communication styles, skills, attitudes, experiences and learning styles of these students. Students Who Have an Individualized Program Plan (IPP ) Students who have been identified as having special education needs will have an Individualized Program Plan (IPP), which should be used to guide teachers' planning and instruction. The needs of these students vary greatly from one individual to the next and may range from physical adaptations to the environment or equipment , to arranging for special testing accommodations.
