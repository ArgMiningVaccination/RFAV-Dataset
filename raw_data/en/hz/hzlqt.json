[Skyhorse](https://www.scribd.com/publisher/438791220/Skyhorse) Reviews for Women Healers of the World 2 ratings0 reviews Book preview Women Healers of the World - Holly Bellebuono PART I: PLANT TRADITIONS Chapter 1 WESTERN HERBAL TRADITIONS Western herbal medicine is a wonderful melting pot of international cultural, biological, and even astrological study. It evolved in concert with a wide variety of practices from around the world, including Eastern practices, shamanism, folk medicine, Arabic and Greek medicine, allopathy, and wise women and witch methods. Ancient Egyptian medical practices originally centered on astrology and magic; Hippocrates and Galen later added anatomical and elemental views that formed the basis of Greek medicine. When Muslims spread across the southern Mediterranean in the ninth century, Arabic medical practitioners added Greek knowledge to their own advanced studies. Soon after, Arabs ventured into clinical, pharmaceutical, and botanical practices, stemming mostly from the Muslim belief that plants were Allah's gift for human health. (By contrast, Europe would not see separate pharmacists specializing in botany for centuries.) Arabic physicians such as Rhazes (Ar-Razi, 869-925) and Avicenna (Ibn Said, 980-1037) passionately promoted botanical medicine so that their discoveries\u2014along with older Greek Galenic knowledge\u2014made their way north to Europe's Salerno School of Medicine in the twelfth century. Finally, Europe could access Arabic medical innovations and read Greek therapeutics in Latin. Western herbal medicine was born. Today, western herbalism is generally considered to include European and North American methods along with some Russian methods, and it is distinct from Asian, African, South American, and other forms of practice. Western herbal medicine draws heavily from Native American traditional uses of plants and includes philosophies from Native American, Greek, British, European, and even North African and Middle Eastern traditions. It can be categorized by the use of common plants for creating and maintaining health without the inclusion of astrology, shamanism, astronomy, necromancy, or other folk traditions though it can include the use of intuition and even animal products such as beeswax and propolis. Philosophies and schools of western herbal medicine have included the Doctrine of Signatures (based on a plant's physical features), Regulars (healing techniques based on purging the body violently), Thomsonian (based on Samuel Thompson's more gentle criteria of healing), phytotherapy (a chemical-oriented approach to medicine), and the Eclectics of the United States (upscale reformist practitioners in the nineteenth century who included a variety of medicaments in their therapies). Zo\u00eb Hawes tasting rose hips Photo credit: Vik Martin Zo\u00eb Hawes Apple orchards, bushels of freshly picked berries, and larders bursting with hot fruit pies: these are the fragrant childhood memories of English nurse and herbalist Zo\u00eb Hawes. Born in Essex and now living near Bath, Somerset, Zo\u00eb's back-to-the-land family grew vegetables, sailed, made functional hand crafts, and camped under the stars in a way that made active outdoor life her natural focus. Her grandparents were raised during the rationing of World War II, and they impressed upon Zo\u00eb and her parents the importance of providing for one's self. Many plants' liquids resemble breast milk (such as wild lettuce, figs, and milkweed) or they are named for their ability to stimulate breast milk production in nursing mothers (milk thistle). The Proto-Indo-European language (PIE) originally used (s)nu to mean flowing, with natural suckling or breast milk connotations. Sanskrit snauti meant she drips, gives milk, and the Greek nao meant I flow. Nu led to nutri and nutrix, she who gives suck, and French coined nourir. Latin created nutricia nurse or governess. In the twelfth century, a nurrice was a wet-nurse or foster-mother. Zo\u00eb's mother noticed a correlation between food additives and Zo\u00eb's wild behavior when she was a child, so they promptly became vegetarian\u2014which greatly improved Zo\u00eb's behavior. Her eyes opened to the positive effects of foods and herbs on her behavior and health, Zo\u00eb used homeopathic remedies, drank chamomile tea, and eventually found her path as a healer. She trained as a nurse and now practices in Frome in a multi-disciplinary clinic where she integrates her knowledge of allopathic nursing with botanical remedies, offering herb walks, classes and workshops on herbal medicine. She is also the nurse at a local boarding school where she introduces simple herbal remedies for many of the students' minor ailments. I love giving the pupils insights about health and how the body works, she says. Zo\u00eb in formulary Photo credit: Vik Martin Zo\u00eb in calendula garden While in nursing training, Zo\u00eb was struck that the medical personnel did not approach their patients with ideas of prevention or a plan for their overall health. I remember seeing the causes of illness clearly in the people I was caring for in hospital, she recalls, and I wondered why nobody seemed to be addressing fundamental basics like diet, stress, and lifestyle as a foundation for regaining health. During a night shift at the hospital, Zo\u00eb found herself collecting the patients' magazines to read in the dark hours, and she discovered an article on herbal medicine written by a medical herbalist. It was like a light bulb switching on, and I knew that was what I wanted to do, she says. She subsequently completed a four-year diploma at Britain's College of Phytotherapy and qualified as a Medical Herbalist in 2000. She is now registered with the National Institute of Medical Herbalists. I remember seeing the causes of illness clearly in the people I was caring for in hospital, and I wondered why nobody seemed to be addressing fundamental basics like diet, stress, and lifestyle as a foundation for regaining health. She attended workshops by other herbalists and found Christopher Headley, who soon became an inspiring mentor. At his workshops, we would all drink a mystery herbal tea and discuss its effects\u2014it was very refreshing after all the science and medicine of the Phytotherapy diploma to do some really experiential stuff. Zo\u00eb credits Headley with a wonderful balance of spiritual, medical, and mystical insights and was reassured to see a successful herbalist talk about [herbs] he had seen work, especially as I was still working in a strongly anti-herb environment like the hospital. Her biggest challenges have been maintaining a belief in her herbal knowledge and not doubting herself, as well as learning to deliver information in an assertive, confident manner. I don't have a colleague to turn to for reassurance or to hand over to at the end of a shift, she says. And she is learning to be patient with the herbal remedies themselves, because they are very different from the magic bullets of allopathic medicine. Having spent seventeen years working in orthodox medicine that aims to deliver instantaneous results, it took time for me to work at the slower pace of herbs, and also to slow the expectations of my patients and to tune them back into the slow adaptive processes of the body. Learn everything you can with your mind, then forget it all and listen to your intuition. Zo\u00eb Hawes's English herbal dispensary, well-protected Wort is an ancient word for plant. Consider St. John's wort, pennywort, soapwort, and spearwort. used wurtiz, Old Saxon used wurt, Old Norse and Danish used urt. Old High German used wurz, but the word kraut won prominence; if this had won in English, we might refer to Hypericum as St. John's kraut. Root, referring to the underground part, appeared in Old English and Old Norse, who used rot, and in German wrot or vrot, virtually indistinguishable from their words for plant. The Proto- Indo-European (PIE) wrd seems to have originated these, according to etymologist Douglas Harper. Eventually the anatomical parts of the plant separated linguistically to form separate words. The Latin radix derived from the PIE wrad, twig or root, giving us radish and radical. In Old English, wort vegetable, plant, herb, or root combined with geard garden or yard to form wortgeard, later shortened phonetically to orceard; hence, our modern orchard. Today an orchard is a collection of fruit trees; in our past, an orchard was a garden of herbs. She published her first book, A Forager's Guide to Medicinal Plants, which extols the virtues of many of her favorite herbs including St. John's wort, plantain, oatstraw, milk thistle, calendula, and Oregon grape root. She also publishes the annual desk diary Herbal Journal: Herbs, Healing and Folkways. With a wise nod to her grandparents, she now owns three acres of meadow and orchard near her cottage and has adopted two children. She is teaching them the ways of straw-bale building, making and selling medicinal foods such as vinegars, fruit, berries, and leaf-herb-flower salads, and running a pharmaculture orchard. Zo\u00eb feels her biggest contribution is passing on the knowledge of medicinal plants to the children she works with at the school, to whom she says: Learn everything you can with your mind, then forget it all and listen to your intuition. Known as the Land of the Summer Farm Dwellers, Somerset in southwest England is known for its ancient Neolithic remains and its Old English, Roman, and Saxon inhabitants. First mentioned in 845 AD, Sumurs\u00e6tum is famed for apple cider and cheeses as well as archaeological treasures from local caves that include one complete skeleton known as Cheddar man, who dates from 7150 BC. The Somerset Levels and Moors are the swampy, sparsely populated wetlands drained by the Romans, and here the ancient practice of coppicing willow trees for fences and baskets continues. Glastonbury, famous for its Tor and King Arthur lore, shares the county with Bath, a city founded upon the hot thermal springs and shrines built by the ancient Celts for the goddess Sulis. In 60 AD, Romans began building a temple and bathing complex here that took three hundred years to complete. They identified Sulis with Minerva, and the temple continued to be known as Aquae Sulis, the waters of Sulis. The baths later silted up from neglect, but the hot thermal springs now support popular spas. Frome, the small medieval town where herbalist Zo\u00eb Hawes runs her dispensary, is named for the River Frome and sits above a system of tunnels beneath the city; it is renowned for woolen cloth manufacture, weaving, cheesemaking, and arts. Somerset is a beautiful rural county steeped in mystery, history and tradition, she says. Magic still exists in hidden corners so strongly that it is tangible. Used internally, St. John's wort is a cure for mild depression, anxiety, and nervous tension and is generally sold as a standardized extract at 3 percent hypericin, what chemists consider its active ingredient. St. John's wort contains glycosides (including retin), volatile oil, tannin, resin, and pectin, and Welsh herbalist David Hoffmann notes its slightly sedative and pain-reducing effect and classifies it as a nervous system tonic. It has been thought to be a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI) contraindicated with antidepressant drugs, but a 1999 study showed St. John's wort does not act by inhibition of monoamine oxidase as previously thought. Though St. John's wort demonstrates neurotransmitter activity, the study showed the herb to be benign, saying possible harm with drug combinations is remote. Anti-inflammatory St. John's wort oil is rubbed externally on sore arthritic joints. When the herb is steeped in oil, the oil turns bright red, which indicated to early healers its use for hot conditions such as burns, sunburn, stings, and aching joints. Maude Grieve suggests its use in pulmonary and urinary complaints, as well as for hysteria, parasites, hemorrhage, and nervous depression. The traditional German word for the plant is hexenkraut, or plant of the witches, as the herb blooms at the summer solstice and has been used in folk medicine to dispel evil spirits. Mama Kia Ingenlath (1949-2010) It looks like a school: there are colorful flags waving, children running, yelling, and laughing, adults carrying tomatoes from the greenhouse with a teenager or helping a child with a skinned knee. There are picnic areas, art tables, and soccer games. Thirty-three children from ages two to eighteen are singing, playing, doing homework, harvesting in the garden, and preparing for a yummy dinner made with basil they grew themselves. It may look like a school, but it feels like\u2014and is\u2014a home. Many call it a miracle. Appropriately, it's named Casa de Milagros: Home of Miracles, and it is the brainchild and work of love of Kia Ingenlath, known as Mama Kia. Mama Kia is a mother, grandmother, and director of the most visionary home in Peru; she is also a wise woman herbalist in the purest sense: it is part of her mission to introduce children to the world of plants. Nine years ago, American-born yoga teacher Kia Ingenlath left Costa Rica and arrived in the fertile lands of the Urubamba Sacred Valley near Cusco, Peru. Kia had very little money, but with the help of several friends, including actor Woody Harrelson, she purchased and renovated a dilapidated two-hundred-year-old hacienda and took in orphaned children. Kia Ingenlath with Luzma This was new for Kia; she had never raised a large number of children before, even though she was well past middle age. But she related to the orphans, partly because she'd been orphaned at the tender age of twelve: her parents, Seventh Day Adventist missionaries, and her brother all died (separately) within the same year. When I turned fifty, she told me in her incredibly quiet, gentle voice, I did a midlife ceremony and dedicated the second half of my life to service. At Macchu Pichu, Kia gathered with friends and a powerful shaman in a ceremony meant to dedicate her life to a new purpose. Everything flowed naturally, she told me, and it was very meaningful. It helped open up the second half of my life. So many Peruvian children are without families. The country suffers a very high rate of child malnutrition and has no social service system, Kia says, and many children bear the brunt of the country's poverty. When children's parents die, the kids are passed from house to house within a village, and many are emotionally, physically, or even sexually abused. Hearing the call to help, Kia created Casa de Milagros in memory of her grandson Chandler Sky who died as an infant. I just received the calling, she says, Everything has flowed together beautifully and I'm doing what I'm meant to do. It's been hard\u2014but we usually learn best when we have to work hard. I have no regrets. She believes that preparing the children for a life of service not only helps them build character, but also creates sustainability. We must start at the root of the problem, healing and educating children so they can give back to their community. Everything has flowed together beautifully and I'm doing what I'm meant to do. It's been hard\u2014but we usually learn best when we have to work hard. I have no regrets. Lovely calendula: the beautiful orange-yellow marigold so named because it was observed to stay colorful and vivid throughout the calendar year. Often called marigold (but not to be confused with proper marigold, Tagetes), calendula's vulnerary and antifungal essential oils, sterols, flavonoids, and mucilage, and calendula tincture is popularly used internally to remove parasites, kill bacterial infections, relieve sepsis, or kill Candida albicans. Used externally, the herb is an effective emollient for the skin. Many herbalists use calendula oil to heal wounds, scrapes, eczema and psoriasis. It is amazingly easy to grow and is profligate in its blossoms\u2014the flower heads break off easily and can be used fresh or dried for tinctures or teas. Girls wear calendula crowns at Casa de Milagros. She turned the decrepit hacienda into a colorful house and adopts each child as her own. Casa de Milagros does not operate the facility as an orphanage, where the children might go away to live with another family. Instead, they are their own family, and Kia raises each son and daughter with values for diversity, success, and kindness. She arranges their schooling, provides extracurricular activities such as music and singing, and encourages traditional Peruvian dancing so the children can study their own heritage. Moreover, at the heart of the home, Kia has created a thriving herbal Permaculture garden in which the children are active planters and harvesters. A Children's Garden At the center of Mama Kia's Home of Miracles is a charming and fully functional medicinal plant garden. All the children, from the youngest to the oldest, learn Permaculture methods of planting, cultivation, and the medicinal properties of healing plants. The garden is not only a plot of land where vegetables are grown; it is a work of art. Terra cotta railings are intricately carved, child-high walls are festooned with colorful paintings of flowers and vines, and banners blow joyfully in the wind. The garden is a place of beauty, respite, food, medicine, and even income, since the orphanage strives to be self-sustaining. Though the not-for-profit accepts monetary contributions and rents accommodations to tourists, it focuses on maintaining its organic vegetable garden and greenhouse, cornfields, raising guinea pigs and rabbits, and using their herbs for medicine whenever possible. Demeter was the Greek's beloved goddess of grains. One theory of Demeter's name is that it derives from da, the Doric form of the Greek ge earth (see Earth sidebar). Da + mater (mother) is earth mother. Mythology historian W. Mannhardt argued that the first part of her name was derived from a Cretan word deai meaning barley, so she was the Barley Mother. I propose it relates to the root of deity (god): the Proto-Indo-European word dewos meant god from the PIE base dyeu to shine and Sanskrit deva god. Perhaps Demeter was shining mother or god mother. It could even be our ancient ancestors considered barley itself to be divine, thus the words for god and barley were nearly identical. Demeter's cult originated in Crete, and Homer dedicated a hymn to her. My name is Dois, she tells the daughters at Eleusis when she is disguised as an old woman after the disappearance of her daughter Kore/Persephone. The Romans called Demeter Ceres, from which we derive cereal. I just received the calling. . . . Looking beyond Casa de Milagros, Kia expands her services to include the broader community. She models proper nutrition for local men and women, teaching them how to grow a variety of food crops organically, which is a new concept for the residents of the Sacred Valley who have traditionally grown only corn and potatoes. As a result of this restricted diet, many children suffer from malnourishment. Kia wants the home to be an example within the community of variety, diversity, and creative expression; to this end, she encourages the children to learn about their heritage through art. All the children at the Home know how to spin yarn and dye fabrics with plant dyes, she says proudly, and she invites children from the wider community to join their craft classes. Beyond meeting the needs of orphans, Casa de Milagros and the Chandler Sky Foundation help conserve one of the world's most biodiverse rainforests. Through teaching children methods of farming that allow the land to be used over and over again, Mama Kia says, there will be a decreased need for migration into the precious rainforest reserves that we, as a planet, need for survival. A typical day for Casa de Milagros children is to go to school, come home, play for an hour, do homework, and head to bed. Twice weekly they study music, singing, and original Peruvian dances. The boys love soccer, and once a week is movie night. On weekends the children work in the Permaculture gardens, growing giant beets and kale. Mama Kia says the children always respond with interest to the gardens and they love watching the seeds sprout. They know all the plants in the garden as well as the medicinal properties. They all have an active role in growing food and herbs in the organic gardens, with an emphasis on conserving water. Among other culinary and medicinal herbs, the children grow comfrey, chamomile, fever few, aloe vera, rosemary, calendula, and lobelia to make medicine for what amounts to a very large family. Many orphans arrive malnourished or with bronchitis, tuberculosis, rickets, chronic intestinal infections, or infections of the skin. By combining an organic farming education with trade skills and an appreciation for the arts, Casa de Milagros and Mama Kia are helping to relieve Cusco of some of the 3,500 abandoned children as well as providing them a healthy childhood and prospects for a better future. Casa de Milagros children's artwork The children always respond with interest to the gardens and they love watching the seeds sprout. They know all the plants in the garden as well as the medicinal properties. Kia has pioneered outreach projects in the local pueblos, including a women's clinic, a midwifery practice, and a soup kitchen that feeds ninety-seven children and twenty elderly people daily. Kia spearheaded Hanaq Pacha Retreat Center ( Where Heaven Meets the Earth). Since jobs are scarce in the Sacred Valley, the center is a place where the teenagers can work as they grow older; all profits from the center support Casa de Milagros. Kia is devoted: When you're living your life and you love what you do, then it doesn't seem like too much. I love what I do; I never have a day that I don't love what I'm doing. Quechua woman with child in Peru Photo credit: Harry Beach The gorgeous river Urubamba flows through the Sacred Valley of the Incas, winding around the base of Mt. Putucusi and Machu Picchu. Here, Mama Kia established her home for children, Casa de Milagros, near the ancient ruins of Yucay, as Cusco, Peru, was called by the Incas. The Sacred Valley of Urubamba, north of Cusco, was considered sacred by the Incas for its fertility and beauty. Archaeological sites nestled between the towering mountains and rolling streams demonstrate the Inca's ancient irrigation systems and farming terraces. Palaces and sun-worship temples were built in Cusco to honor the god; constructed in the shape of a sacred Puma, one temple had a fortress as the puma's head. In 1533, Spanish conquistador Francisco Pizarro arrived in Cusco with Vasco de Balboa; believing the Incan city of Piru to be el Dorado, he and his soldiers plundered the city, desecrated its temples, and melted gold and silver artwork. Though most of the structures were demolished, some of the stone bases later became the foundations for houses and churches. The community surrounding Casa de Milagros is very poor; most people have dirt floors, and guinea pigs eat food scraps from the floor (the guinea pigs themselves are eaten by the people and are considered a valuable food source). Mama Kia's neighbors cook with wood, and though a few people in the province can afford electricity, Kia estimated the average income at only about $300 per year. Most children are malnourished. They have few clothes or shoes, so Casa de Milagros shares its surplus supplies with the community. Most people speak Quechua, the language of their Incan ancestors. Today, Casa de Milagros encourages its children to honor their ancestors through dance, music, handcrafts, weaving, and song. After the fall of the Incan empire to the Conquistadors, most surviving Incans adopted Catholicism. Most Peruvians today are Catholic, and Kia noted there many religious celebrations honoring the Virgin Mary. Casa de Milagros raises the children at Casa de Milagros to make their own decisions regarding religion and she teaches that different cultures have different religions. This philosophy of tolerance and appreciation goes hand-in-hand with her community service work in the rich and fertile valley of Urubamba. Machu Picchu The good herb, Yerba Buena is our familiar mint, native to Europe, Asia, and North America. The humble yet tenacious mint is circumboreal, thriving across Pangaea long before the continents divided. Mint boasts thirty species, some of which were brought to the New World with the colonists (to greet other mint species already living there), while additional species were introduced to the Philippines by Spaniards. We enjoy many species of mint: peppermint, spearmint, water mint, chocolate mint, apple mint (with its fuzzy leaves resembling mullein). Mints will thrive in virtually any condition: poor soil, wet soil, dry fields, creek banks, gardens, and abandoned lots. Yerba Buena is most similar to Mentha arvensis, or field mint, and residents throughout South America chew its carminative leaves to aid digestion, oral health, and circulation; the scent and taste invigorate and refresh, making Yerba Buena valued worldwide for keeping one alert and awake. Rosemary Gladstar Often called the Mother of the American Herbal movement, Rosemary Gladstar is an icon in the field of herbal medicine. She is a bubbly, warm, enthusiastic advocate for herbal medicine and a champion for protecting our wild medicinal plants. Rosemary's relationship with herbs began as a child in a farming community in Sonoma County. Her grandmother, Mary Egitkanoff, Rosemary's first herbal teacher, was an herbalist in the old sense of the word: she used plants simply because they were available, they made sense, and they were free. Mary and her husband had fled the Armenian genocide and she impressed upon Rosemary at a young age that it was Mary's belief in God and her knowledge of the plants that had saved her life. She meant that literally, says Rosemary. Without her knowledge of the plants, they would have starved to death and, without such strong faith and hope, they would have given up. Mary frequently took Rosemary into the fields around their farmhouse to teach her how to gather wild plants, which plants were good to eat, which ones were dangerous, and\u2014especially\u2014which ones were good for medicine. Those teachings have stayed with me all my life, and most of my favorite herbs are still those I learned on those walks with my grandmother. Rosemary Gladstar and her mother, Jasmine Karr Rosemary with rosemary Since Rosemary was already very close to the land, the back-to-the-land movement of the 1960s did not inspire her to live on a farm. Instead, it germinated within her the desire to explore deep wilderness. After graduating high school, she backpacked across the mountains of northern California, Oregon, and Washington. In 1972, she returned to Sonoma County filled with the dream to journey to Canada on horseback. She needed money to buy horses and supplies, so she got a cleaning job at Guerneville Natural Food Store, scrubbing floors and sinks after hours. But her knowledge of plants quickly shone through and she was elevated to herb lady, earning the money she needed to purchase horses. Her journey began the following summer when she took her toddler son and a friend on the horseback ride of a lifetime: from Sonoma County to the Trinity Alps of Northern California. Amazingly, the two women wildcrafted all the food on their journey. We ate greens, berries, and nuts we gathered along the way, she says. We all kept fat and healthy the whole four months we rode, and I returned from that trip ready to give back. I felt so blessed by life and wanted to share what I was learning with the rest of the world! Where we are seeded, planted and grown has a lasting influence in our lives, I'm quite sure. It certainly did for me. Adept at herbal formulation and intuiting an individual's needs, she opened Rosemary's Garden in Sebastopol, teaching herb classes and facilitating gatherings to bring other plant lovers together. It was an exciting, rich time as we woke up to the world of plants that were living beings right under our feet, Rosemary remembers. There was so much to share and learn because herbalism had been resting peacefully 'under ground' for several decades and we felt we were just discovering it! With friends, she opened Traditional Medicinals, an outlet "}
