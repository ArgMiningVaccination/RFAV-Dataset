Our desire is to see our patients become healthier than they have ever been! We encourage our patients to use chiropractic, exercise, and nutrition to achieve this goal. Unfortunately, we live in an unhealthy world that has become even more difficult to maintain an optimally functioning body without some help. That is when supplementation comes into use. With the infinite number of supplements on the market it can be difficult to know what is useful and too expensive to simply take everything. To better inform you on what are the best supplements and oils available, we wrote a quick summary of our top 10 supplements and top 5 essential oils and their benefits. The Top 10 Supplements: 10. NAC N-acetyl cysteine is a mucinogen, which means it breaks up mucus. It is often used to improve bronchitis, sinus infections, COPD, and pneumonia. Often NAC is used in hospitals to treat acetaminophen overdoses, ALS, and liver toxicity. It has been used extensively during the COVID pandemic due to its effectiveness against viral respiratory infections. NAC combines very effectively with Olive Leaf Extract as a powerful duo against illnesses. 9. Multivitamin A multivitamin can be a great daily foundation for an individual's health. Make sure your multivitamin contains a complete B-vitamin, dissolves in vinegar in less than 7 minutes, does not use calcium carbonate as its calcium source, is not made synthetically, but is made from whole foods, and is reasonably priced. As a bonus, if your multivitamin contains a B-complex it should provide a good energy boost to your day when combined with L-tyrosine. 8. L-Tyrosine L-Tyrosine is an amino acid found in dairy, meat, eggs, nuts, beans, and oats. It is a precursor to the production of thyroid hormones, dopamine, and adrenaline. It's not a stimulant, but does work well as a treatment for weight loss (appetite suppressant), ADD, mental fatigue, depression, and PMS. Do not sleep within four hours of taking. For those who believe they may be struggling with HPA axis dysfunction (also known as adrenal fatigue), L-tyrosine can be useful for bringing restoration to this disorder. It combines very well with the multivitamin for giving energy to your day. 7. GABA Gama Amino Butyric Acid is a neurotransmitter produced and utilized in the brain. It acts as an inhibitory to the central nervous system; therefore it has a calming effect on the brain. This supplement is often used to treat anxiety and induce healthy sleep patterns. It can be taken on a regular basis or occasionally when the need arises. It combines very well with CBD oils to relax the brain in times of high stress. [6. Vitamin D3](https://www.coreroanoke.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Vitamin-D-3.png) Vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) is the only version of Vitamin D that is readily absorbable as a supplement. Your body can make vitamin D when exposed to sunlight. You can ingest Vitamin D when you eat/drink milk, fish, fish oils, and egg yolks. Vitamin D deficiency is widely common and can cause many biological problems including a decrease in bone density (Rickets), cardiovascular disease, cognitive impairment, severe asthma in children, and cancer. Vitamin D may help conditions such as diabetes (types I and II), hypertension, glucose intolerance, and multiple sclerosis. Vitamin D deficiency can be created by limited sun exposure and overuse of suntan lotions, reduction in dietary Vitamin D intake, dark skin, living in the North, age related kidney dysfunction, digestive disorders, and obesity. Most common months for Vitamin D deficiencies are October-April and August. 5. CBD Oils CBD oils have remained popular since first bursting onto the supplement scene a few years ago. CBD is popularly used for pain relief, anxiety, stress, and sleep difficulties. There is a mountain of research showing how effective CBD oils are and even outshine pharmaceuticals in some areas. Our office offers several ways that CBD oil can be taken: oil under the tongue, gummy chewables, or a skin cream. CBD oil pairs very well with GABA for relaxation and pain control. 4. Olive Leaf Extract Olive Leaf Extract is known as nature's antibiotic. This powerful plant extract kills viruses and bacteria by inhibiting their ability to replicate. It is most effective when taken at the first sign of symptoms. This supplement is exceptional in reducing symptoms and shortening the length of time symptoms are present. It is often paired with NAC to fight current infections or with a multivitamin and/or L-glutamine for disease prevention. 3. Whey Protein Protein supplements are a fantastic way to improve muscle-to-fat ratios by stabilizing blood sugar and increasing muscle recovery and size. When combined with resistive weight training or high-intensity interval training, whey protein is a fast track to burning body fat and decreasing fat deposits around the hips, thighs, and abdomen. Good protein mixtures have a greater than 75% yield ratio of protein to total grams per serving. Whey protein powders should be found in an isolate form or micro-filtered to improve intestinal absorption. Avoid any protein source that uses Soy Protein Isolates or Hydrolyzed Soy Proteins. High-quality protein powders will dissolve without the use of a blender and will not cause intestinal cramping. Whey protein combines very well with Fish/Flax oils in a smoothie for weight loss and gut healing. [2. Flax/Fish Oil](https://www.coreroanoke.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Flax-Fish-Oil.jpg) Omega-3 fats are essential to a healthy life. Widely known as DHA and EPA, these fatty acids are used to produce eicosanoids, which are known to reduce inflammation and improve fat and cholesterol ratios in the body. Omega-3 fats have been shown to: Improve: depression, anxiety, psoriasis, arthritis degeneration, hair and skin disorders Reduce: blood pressure, macular degeneration, dementia, Alzheimer's and Parkinson's, Lupus symptoms, hormone deficiencies Fight: cancer, inflammatory bowel diseases (Crohn's, Diverticulitis, IBD, etc.) The quality of fish/flax oils is highly important. The ratio of Omega-3s to Omega-6s should be close to a 4:1 ratio. Sourced from Krill, Sardines, Herring, Salmon, and/or Flax are preferred. 1. L-Glutamine L-Glutamine is a conditional essential amino acid that is widely used in many different processes of the body including: protein synthesis, regulation of acid-base balance, cellular energy, and production of all three muscle types. Broken down into glutamic acid and then into glutathione, L-glutamine is a powerful detoxifier of the body. It's used in large quantities during times of stress, both physically and emotionally. It can be found naturally in foods such as beef, chicken, fish, eggs, milk, wheat, cabbage, beets, spinach, parsley, and oats. Used clinically to: - Improve alkalinity to aid in body fat burning. - Increase muscle production. - Reduce muscle soreness and healing time. - Reduce symptoms caused by prolonged stressful time periods. - Improve healing after a burn or infection. - Help the body fight cancer cells. - Improve gastrointestinal problems and ulcers. - Improve the immune system's ability to kill bacteria and viruses. - Improve deep sleep patterns. - Reduce alcohol cravings. - Reduce sugar cravings. [Bonus: Curcumin](https://www.coreroanoke.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Curcumin.jpg) Curcumin is the major component of the well-known spice Turmeric (Curcuma longa). Extensive scientific research on Curcumin has demonstrated that it has potent free radical scavenging properties capable of dramatically reducing inflammation. Through this and other mechanisms, Curcumin may support colon health, promote joint comfort, support healthy neurological function, and help to maintain a healthy cardiovascular system. Patients suffering from arthritis pain and/or looking to decrease their cardiovascular risk factors often find Curcumin very beneficial. Curcumin combines very well with CBD oil and L-glutamine for reducing muscle pain and increasing healing rates. These are 5 Oils That Everyone Needs In Their Homes 1.
