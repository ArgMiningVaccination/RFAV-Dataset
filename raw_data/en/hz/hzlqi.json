Spring is just around the corner, and so is a fresh slew of beauty trends \u2014 many of which have started out as viral sensations ( [see: slugging](https://www.bustle.com/style/slugging-benefits-for-skin-i-tried-it)). [Dr. Alexis of [SUNNIE](https://sunnieskin.com/) and [Parcells Plastic Surgery](https://www.alexisparcellsmd.com/), says [TikTok](https://www.bustle.com/style/clinique-almost-lipstick-black-honey-review) has played a big role in spring 2022's skin care trends. \"Consumers get an idea from TikTok, and then do research,\" she tells Bustle. Despite this, Parcells notes that expert opinions are essential when it comes to choosing skin care that's right for you. But experts have increasingly been turning to social media to share their intel with skin care-curious followers. \"We're seeing more true experts putting out valuable information on social media channels \u2014 now more than ever \u2014 and this will continue to pointing to the influx of TikTok-savvy dermatologists (such as herself) sharing the science behind skin care ingredients to their accounts. \"This is helpful for people who are not able to have an appointment with a dermatologist, or who might be considering a harmful viral skin care trend.\" ( [Do-it-yourself hyaluronic acid fillers](https://www.bustle.com/style/diy-lip-fillers-tiktok-dangers-dermatologists) are a prime example of that.) Consumers are gravitating towards [skin care backed by science](https://www.bustle.com/style/how-to-find-skin-care-products-that-work-experts) \u2014 thus, it's no surprise that so many up-and-coming trends are rooted in research. Read on for the spring 2022 skin care trends experts believe will take over beauty shelves next season. We only include products that have been independently selected by Bustle's editorial team. However, we may receive a portion of sales if you purchase a product through a link in this article. 1. Slugging Thanks to TikTok, slugging \u2014 the act of slathering a heavy-duty occlusive (like [petroleum jelly](https://www.bustle.com/articles/156746-10-reasons-vaseline-should-be-a-staple-in-your-beauty-routine)) as the last step of one's nighttime regimen \u2014 is more popular than ever, even though it's been done for decades. \"This locks in moisture and any other ingredients you've applied,\" says Parcells of the trend that currently has over [168 million views on the platform](https://www.tiktok.com/tag/slugging). \"Sealing the skin barrier with hydration and preventing water loss can help repair damaged, cracked, flaky skin.\" Before you grab your tub of Vaseline, however, Parcells says that using petroleum-based products all over the skin isn't for everyone. \"If done incorrectly, it could wreak serious havoc on your skin,\" she says. If you're [prone to oiliness, breakouts, and/or have sensitive skin](https://www.bustle.com/style/sensitive-oily-acne-prone-skin), Parcells creams rich in [ceramides](https://www.bustle.com/p/what-are-ceramides-heres-the-low-down-on-the-trending-ingredient-19216025), [jojoba oil](https://www.bustle.com/p/the-3-best-jojoba-oils-11876509), and/or [squalane](https://www.bustle.com/style/squalane-for-skin) as alternatives, as they also replenish the skin barrier and keep water locked in without clogging the pores or leaving a greasy residue. 2. Cleansing Bars Sustainability and plastic-free packaging will remain at the forefront of beauty next season \u2014 especially in the skin care realm. [Dr. Snehal Amin, M.D](https://www.mdcsnyc.com/)., board-certified dermatologist and co-founder of [MDCS Dermatology](https://www.mdcsnyc.com/provider/marisa-k-garshick-md?), points to the use of non-degradable chemicals and plastic as things of the past. \"Sustainable skin care has taken the form of waterless products, which reduce carbon emissions by less transportation effort,\" he says, pointing to more compostable packaging and plastic-free products. Oftentimes, you'll see that in the form of cleansing bars. Joanna Vargas, celebrity facialist, founder of [Joanna Vargas Salons](https://joannavargas.com/pages/the-spas) and [Skin Care](https://joannavargas.com/collections/shop-all) and author of [Glow From Within](https://joannavargas.com/pages/glowfromwithin), tells Bustle that cleansing bars are having a major moment. \"The trend of sustainability and mindful packaging will bring cleansing bars into the forefront as the modern version of the traditional bar serves some great ingredients without the waste.\" 3. Simplified Routines Over-using beauty products and tools is a thing of the past, says [Dr. Marisa Garshick](https://www.mdcsnyc.com/provider/marisa-k-garshick-md?), M.D., board-certified dermatologist at boom led to 'abusing' skin care, which disrupts our [skin barrier](https://www.bustle.com/p/the-5-best-barrier-creams-18667320) and our natural microbiome,\" she tells Bustle. \"Now I see more people coming into my practice with reactions, or worsened skin conditions: The more exposure to unnecessary ingredients, the more chance of sensitization leading to rashes and breakouts down the line.\" This is why people are [minimizing their beauty routines](https://www.bustle.com/style/skin-care-routine-order-experts), opting to use multipurpose products in lieu of a dozen different serums and creams. \"People are seeking products that provide multiple benefits,\" Garshick says, pointing to [sunscreens that offer antioxidant benefits](https://www.bustle.com/style/sunscreen-skin-care-makeup-hybrid-products) and multifunctional serums that target multiple skin concerns as two key examples. 4. Niacinamide-Spiked Products As people simplify their beauty routines, they will also be ensuring these more minimal regimens focus on [protecting their skin barrier](https://www.bustle.com/style/best-products-for-dehydrated-skin), says Garshick. Because of this, she foresees [niacinamide](https://www.bustle.com/p/niacinamides-skin-care-benefits-are-so-vast-its-about-to-become-your-new-favorite-ingredient-18204200) as a must-know skin-nourishing superstar you'll increasingly find in formulas. \"This ingredient is being incorporated for its many different uses to help soothe skin, calm inflammation and redness, reduce hyperpigmentation, and support the skin barrier,\" she tells Bustle. \"This makes it a great option, especially for those with sensitive skin.\" As your complexion braces for the transition between seasons, Garshick notes niacinamide's anti-inflammatory prowess can help keep your skin calm and collected. 5. Cleansing Balms Skin care aficionados know the power of a [double cleanse](https://www.bustle.com/p/what-is-double-cleansing-this-k-beauty-method-could-give-you-the-cleanest-skin-of-your-life-78786) for making sure pores are fully ready to soak up their routines. And, according to Garshick, many are reaching for [cleansing balms](https://www.bustle.com/p/the-5-best-cleansing-balms-18717550) to do the proper cleansing job. She says that these products work best as part of a two-step double cleanse to ensure makeup and sunscreen are completely removed, or used instead of a traditional cleanser. \"These work particularly well on those with dry or sensitive skin,\" she adds. A key perk? They cleanse without leaving the skin feeling dry or irritated, says Garshick. Some examples of new ones on the shelves include [B.O.M Voyage by Wander Beauty](https://www.wanderbeauty.com/products/bom-voyage-cleansing-balm) and [Drunk Elephant Slaai Makeup-Melting Butter Cleanser](https://www.drunkelephant.com/products/slaai-makeup-melting-butter-cleanser). 6. Neck & Jawline Care This next season will also see a rise in treating the neck and jawline \u2014 which should come as no surprise, considering [Bella Hadid-approved jaw-highlighting](https://www.bustle.com/style/jaw-highlighting-tiktok-contouring-trend-bella-hadid) has been trending on TikTok. \"People have been spending so much time on Zoom seeing themselves on screen or looking down at their phones. With this, they're noticing more skin laxity and fine lines around the neck,\" Garshick tells Bustle. She's seeing more neck creams specially formulated to target these concerns as well as in-office procedures \u2014 think laser resurfacing, microneedling, and radiofrequency. Also more popular than ever? Using sha to sculpt the neck and jawline](https://www.bustle.com/style/gua-sha-for-jawline) ( [#guasha](https://www.tiktok.com/tag/guasha) has over 873 million views on TikTok). 7. Cooling Skin Care While temperatures may increase in the springtime, skin care products will do the opposite. \" [Cryotherapy](https://www.bustle.com/style/charlotte-tilburys-cryo-recovery-mask) has been popular in the salon for years, but as an at-home treatment it's going to really be big this year,\" Vargas tells Bustle, pointing to devices like her [Magic Glow Wand](https://joannavargas.com/products/magic-glow-wand). \"Cryotherapy helps soothe inflammation and de-puff the skin, which never goes out of style.\" Shirazi concurs, adding that she's seeing more [cooling in beauty product applications](https://www.bustle.com/style/skin-care-fridge-products) as well (think metal tip applicators and cooling facial globes). \"We'll see a cooler way of dispensing and applying our skin care products,\" she explains. \"Cool temperatures cause the skin's blood vessels to contract and temporarily shrinks pores, resulting in the skin looking firmer and more rejuvenated. It also helps reduce puffiness, particularly around the eyes in the morning.\" Make some room in your fridge for these. 8. Body Retinol According to Shirazi, springtime will also present an opportunity to expand [skin care's focus beyond the face](https://www.bustle.com/style/moisturize-entire-body-pandemic-self-care-body-care). While body care has been rising in popularity over the past couple of years, she's seeing a particular boom in body retinols \u2014 especially as people grow to treat the skin beneath their neck just like that on their face. \"People are recognizing the importance of taking care of all of their skin, not just their facial skin, to maintain their skin health,\" says Garshick. And, of course, retinol's benefits still apply to your d\u00e9colletage and limbs, so it works to smooth the skin and stimulate collagen while combatting dark spots. 9. Personalized Products Vargas tells Bustle that conventional skin type \"categories\" are on their way out, and [personalized skin care](https://www.bustle.com/style/skin-care-routine-for-acne) is set to take the stage come spring. \"I think the traditional categories of oily, dry, and normal skin types is a bit dated,\" she explains. \"We know so much more about health now and many factors lead you to have the skin condition you see in the mirror.\" Though regular facials and dermatologist appointments are your best bet for figuring out what your skin needs, you'll also see more products formulated to target certain skin conditions versus types. Several beauty brands have adapted this outlook on skin care, such as [Holifrog](https://holifrog.com/), and many more will likely follow suit. 10. Skin-Soothing Exfoliants Exfoliants are becoming gentler, which is a perk for everyone's beauty routine. \"There is currently focus on reducing acne scarring and hyperpigmentation by exfoliating the skin and using [at-home facial peels](https://www.bustle.com/style/the-7-best-at-home-chemical-peels-according-to-a-dermatologist-64528),\" celebrity esthetician [Mimi Luzon](https://www.mimi-luzon.com/en/company/a/about/) tells Bustle, who's seeing a surge in exfoliants that help improve texture without damaging the skin's natural barrier. \" [Exfoliating acids](https://www.bustle.com/p/the-6-best-chemical-exfoliants-16980511) are so good for the skin, and can create a glow by gently peeling away dead cells and making way for the new,\" she says. Her Mimi Luzon 24K Pure Gold is one example that [boosts cellular turnover](https://www.bustle.com/style/is-retinol-an-exfoliant) while protecting and hydrating the skin via glycerin and castor oil, and [Glow Recipe's new Strawberry Smooth Serum](https://www.bustle.com/style/glow-recipe-strawberry-smooth-bha-aha-salicylic-serum-launch) balances the AHAs and BHAs in its formula with soothing allantoin and hyaluronic acid. 11. Sculpting Facial Tools According to [Ada Ooi](https://www.instagram.com/ada.ooi/), celebrity facialist, Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) expert, and founder of [001 Skincare](https://www.001skincare.com/), [sculpting tools and devices](https://www.bustle.com/style/skin-care-tools) will reign supreme this spring. \"Using facial massaging tools, [such as] [gua sha](https://www.bustle.com/style/gua-sha-for-jawline), is a trend that is not going anywhere anytime soon,\" she tells Bustle. Think: vibrating massage wands, rollers, and microcurrent tools. Her take? Besides the facial toning and de-puffing benefits, these devices allow you to take time out of your day for a calming sensorial experience. \"It's beneficial to your overall sense of wellbeing,\" she says. 12. Skin Care Through Makeup Ooi also sees an uptick in [makeup that also works as skin care](https://www.bustle.com/style/serum-foundation-products-skin-care-makeup-benefits). \"Cosmetics that only work on a superficial level are out of style,\" she tells Bustle. Hence why she's seeing a boom in makeup products formulated with skin-boosting ingredients that allow you to care for your complexion as you get coverage. \"People are toning down heavy makeup and learning to take care of their skin, so the [natural looking skin trend](https://www.bustle.com/style/princesscore-makeup-bridgerton-beauty-trend) is here,\" she says, pointing to an increase in sheer makeup formulas that double as skin care and offer a minimal yet radiance-optimizing glow. 13. TCM-Inspired Skin Care Ooi also asserts that the lockdown prompted a resurgence in [TCM-based skin care](https://www.bustle.com/p/7-things-your-feet-reveal-about-your-health-according-to-eastern-medicine-9163814). \"This time has made us realize that there are many alternatives to boost our skin, mood, and well-being, especially [through] methodologies that have been developed and used for centuries across cultures,\" she tells Bustle. While the popularity of both [gua sha](https://www.bustle.com/style/face-oil-for-gua-sha) and [cupping](https://www.bustle.com/p/how-does-cupping-therapy-work-i-tried-it-my-back-has-never-felt-better-60643) count as proof, she notes the ingredients also come into play. She specifically cites reishi [mushrooms](https://www.bustle.com/p/mushroom-beauty-will-be-huge-in-2020-so-here-are-the-products-to-try-19771980) and [ginseng root](https://www.bustle.com/wellness/how-to-use-adaptogens-experts/amp) \u2014 two botanicals commonly founder of [Joanna Vargas of [001 Skincare](https://www.001skincare.com/) [Mimi Luzon](https://www.mimi-luzon.com/en/company/a/about/), celebrity esthetician This article was originally published on "}
