The battle against the 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) has not concluded. Despite the availability of vaccines, the high prevalence of vaccine hesitancy represents a significant challenge to public health, and raising vaccine acceptance among the public is critical. Although media has become an increasingly popular source of COVID-19 vaccine-related information, the question of whether and how media use is related to the public's vaccine hesitancy warrants exploration. This study aimed to (1) examine the level of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy, (2) identify factors associated with COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy, and (3) explore the direct and indirect relationship between media use and vaccine hesitancy through psychological factors. A month before COVID-19 vaccination was initiated in South Korea, we conducted a cross-sectional web-based survey over 6 days (January 20-25, 2021). This study included 1016 participants, and a logit model for regression analyzed associations between sociodemographic factors, health-related factors, psychological factors, and media use toward one's COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy. Additionally, we conducted a path analysis to examine the indirect effects of media use on vaccine hesitancy by using psychological factors (ie, perceived risk of COVID-19 infection, perceived benefits, and perceived barriers of COVID-19 vaccination). Among the participants (N=1016), 53.3% (541/1016) hesitated to take the COVID-19 vaccine, while 46.7% (475/1016) agreed to accept the vaccine. Of the sociodemographic factors, female gender (odds ratio [OR] 1.967, 95% CI 1.36-2.86; Our findings revealed a considerable level of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy in South Korea. Gender-based and generation-based public health policies and communication are recommended. Efforts to lower the perceived risk of vaccine side effects and heighten perceived benefits of the vaccine are required. Although the use of media has a positive and negative effect on the population's vaccine hesitancy, efforts should be made to disseminate reliable and timely information on media while confronting misinformation or disinformation for successive implementation of vaccine programs during pandemics. Although the 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) continues to spread worldwide and the public health emergency continues, the battle to overcome COVID-19 remains active. The development of effective vaccines has been highly anticipated, and several vaccines are now available; however, the timeliness of vaccine development and availability are not the only obstacles to overcome from a public health perspective. Raising vaccine acceptance and uptake among the public is essential to elevate public health emergency preparedness, which refers to the level of readiness for public health systems, communities, and individuals to prevent, respond to, and recover from public health emergencies [ Despite the availability of vaccination services, the phenomenon of delayed vaccine acceptance or refusal is referred to as vaccine hesitancy [ Vaccine hesitancy is complex and context-specific, varying across time, place, and vaccines. Therefore, hesitation of COVID-19 vaccination should be understood in that context. Epidemiologically, COVID-19 is a highly infectious disease with a basic reproduction number of between 2 and 3, and there is a sharp increase in the number of confirmed cases worldwide [ Along with the factors mentioned above, scholars paid attention to the effects of using various media (eg, offline media, online media, social media) as vaccine-related information sources on vaccine hesitancy. Vaccine-related health information has shaped perceptions, attitudes, and emotions related to the vaccine. Using offline media such as listening to the radio and reading the newspaper frequently was associated with increased vaccination odds [ There is limited evidence about the acceptance or hesitancy of the COVID-19 vaccine in practice, and the influencing factors of vaccine hesitancy and whether and how media use can influence the public's vaccine hesitancy warrants further exploration. Therefore, this study conducted a survey a month before the start of vaccination and addressed the level of vaccine hesitancy and investigated factors related to vaccine hesitancy along with which populations to prioritize in COVID-19 vaccination interventions. Moreover, we examined how media use interacts with psychological factors for vaccine hesitancy. Specifically, this study aimed to (1) examine the level of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy, (2) quantify and test the relationships between sociodemographic, health-related, psychological factors, media use, and COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy, and (3) examine how psychological factors interplay with the media use on vaccine hesitancy. Implications for developing and implementing evidence-based interventions and policies to raise vaccine acceptance and uptake are also discussed in this paper. We conducted a web-based cross-sectional survey on January 20, 2021\u2014a month before vaccination was initiated in South Korea. The questionnaire, which consisted of 83 questions, was developed to (1) evaluate the public's hesitancy of the COVID-19 vaccine and (2) assess the association with health-related factors, psychological factors, and media use by using an anonymous web-based questionnaire. The survey was conducted via a web-based platform from a research company called Korea Research. The company recruited participants by sending survey invitations containing general information about the survey, such as its aim and consent statement via email or text messages, and then registered survey panel members who met the inclusion criteria. The inclusion criteria were as follows: (1) 18 years or older, (2) a resident in South Korea, and (3) a Korean speaker. The company sampled the participants by age, sex, and geographic region-based proportional and quota sampling process. The respondents provided electronic informed consent that appeared on the first page of the survey, and the company protected the confidentiality of the anonymous respondents. Over 1033 participants completed the surveys, and 1016 were included in the analysis after excluding incomplete responses. This study was reviewed and approved by the Institutional Review Board at Seoul National University (IRB 2101/003-005), Seoul, South Korea. All participants provided their informed consent upon enrollment. The data collection took place over 5 days (January 20-25, 2021), a year after the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention confirmed the first case at the early stage of the epidemic (January 20, 2020). A 5-point scale questionnaire measured the intention to be vaccinated for COVID-19. Participants were asked, \"If a vaccine for coronavirus (COVID-19) becomes available, would you want to receive it?\" and provided response options want to receive it.\" The COVID-19 vaccination intention response options of \"Definitely not,\" \"Probably would not,\" and \"half and hesitancy=1,\" and the options \"probably would\" and \"Definitely want to receive it\" were acceptance=0\" to create dichotomous \"acceptance\" variable. Sociodemographic factors included gender (1=male, 2=female), age, family size (ie, living alone, more than 2 persons), the presence of children at home who attend school (more than one=1, none=0), marital status (ie, married, single, divorced, bereaved), and the participants' residence (urban=1, rural=2). We also assessed education level (1=middle school or below, 2=high school graduate, 3=college and above) and monthly household income in South Korean won (1000 won=US $0.87; 1=<2 million won, 2=2 million to 3.99 million won, 3=4 million to 5.99 million won, and 4=6 million to 7.99 million won, 5=8 million won). Health-related factors included seasonal influenza vaccination history, presence of underlying disease, subjective health, and previous COVID-19 diagnosis for the participants. For seasonal influenza vaccination history, participants were asked, \"Have you been vaccinated against the seasonal influenza flu in the last 5 years?\" Responses included We grouped the as having seasonal influenza vaccination history (\"every year,\" \"more than (poor=1, moderate=2, good=3) was investigated to assess health-related factors. We also investigated the presence of underlying disease by asking participants to indicate all diagnosed underlying diseases (eg, hypertension, dyslipidemia, diabetes, chronic cardiac disease, asthma, cancer). We grouped the participants as being with or without diagnoses of one or more underlying diseases. We included the following question to assess participants' media use to obtain vaccine-related health information via various information sources such as offline media (eg, television, radio, newspapers), online media (internet news sites, news portals), and social media (Twitter, Facebook, Kakao Talk, YouTube, blogs, communities). We used a 4-point rating scale (1=not at all to 4=always) to ask the following question: \"How often do you use the following information source to seek information about COVID-19 vaccine?\" Questions to determine the psychological factors that could influence COVID-19 vaccination were adapted from the Health Belief Model and included perceived risk of COVID-19 infection, fear of COVID-19 infection, perceived benefits of COVID-19 vaccination, perceived barriers of vaccination, and trust in the government ( Framework of this study. All quantitative variables were reported in numbers, proportions, means, and standard deviations. The responses to the COVID-19 vaccination acceptance questions were categorized into binary groups: (1) those who would accept COVID-19 vaccination (acceptance group) and (2) those who hesitated to uptake COVID-19 vaccination (hesitancy group). Differences in sociodemographic and health-related factors were compared with the COVID-19 vaccination hesitancy by using the chi-square statistics to determine the role of sociodemographic and health-related factors in COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy. A multivariable analysis was developed in 2 stages. First, we performed a logistic regression to evaluate factors associated with COVID-19 vaccination hesitancy, including sociodemographic factors (ie, gender, age, family size, education, marital status, income, employment) and health-related factors (ie, subjective health and presence of underlying disease), media use (ie, offline media, online media, and social media), and psychological factors (ie, perceived susceptibility and severity toward COVID-19, perceived benefits and barriers of COVID-19 vaccination, and trust in government). In the second stage, a path analysis was carried out to describe the direct and indirect associations of media use and psychological factors with vaccine hesitancy using the Lavaan package (v0.6-9) [ Among the 1016 participants, 48.8% (496/1016) were men and 51.2% (520/1016) were women, with a mean age of 47.04 (SD 15.04) years ( Sociodemographic and health-related characteristics of the study participants (N=1016). |Characteristics||Values, n (%)| | | is applicable. Among the 1016 participants, 10.2% (104/1016) stated that they definitely would accept the vaccination, while 36.5% (371/1016) would probably accept the vaccination. However, 37.5% (381/1016) of the participants reported that they were \"half 10.8% not\" get vaccinated ( Distribution of responses regarding the question \"If a vaccine for coronavirus (COVID-19) becomes available, would you want to receive it?\" Differences in the sociodemographic and health-related factors were compared with the COVID-19 vaccination hesitancy by using chi-square statistics ( Chi-square statistics for variables related to COVID-19 vaccination hesitancy and acceptance. |Characteristics||Likelihood of getting the COVID-19 vaccine (N=1016)| | ||Acceptance (n=475), n (%)||Hesitancy (n=541), conversion rate of 1000 won=US $0.87 is applicable. We examined how often people used media sources (offline media, online media, social media) to learn about COVID-19 vaccination. Interestingly, participants sought little vaccine-related health information via social media; the average social media information seeking was close to \"sometimes\" (score=2) (mean 1.83 [SD 0.70]). By contrast, the participants used online media more often (mean 2.70 [SD 0.81]), followed by offline media (mean 2.66 [SD 0.95]) ( Media use and psychological characteristics of the study participants. |Characteristics||Values, mean (SD)| | | in government||2.80 (0.68)| Participants perceived the risk of becoming infected with COVID-19 (perceived susceptibility) as being \"moderate\" (score=3) (mean 3.05 [SD 0.74]). Only 3.1% (31/1016) (score=5) and 18.8% (191/1016) reported \"high\" (score=4). Many participants reported that the chance of infection is \"neither high nor low\" (621/1016, 61.1%). The average perceived severity score was higher than perceived susceptibility, which was close to \"high\" (score=4) (mean 3.95 [SD 0.76]). However, among the participants, 55.1% (560/1016) reported that the severity would (195/1016) reported \"very high\" (score=5). Participants' perception of vaccination benefits was measured by 2 items measuring perceived chances of gaining specific benefits by COVID-19 vaccination. The average score was higher than \"moderate\" (score=3) (mean 3.38 [SD 0.81]). Among the benefits, \"self-protection of my health\" was the highest (mean 3.74 [SD 0.968]) and \"proved efficacy of the vaccine\" was the lowest (mean 2.80 [SD 0.964]). The average score for perceived barriers to vaccination was neither high nor low (mean 3.29 [SD 0.90]). The belief that a vaccination caused COVID-19 infection was relatively low (mean 2.85 [SD 1.110]); however, concerns about side effects were high (mean 3.72 [SD 1.007]). Among the participants, 23.8% (242/1016) reported their concerns that the vaccination's side effects are \"very high,\" while 38.2% (388/1016) reported they were \"high.\" The average score of trust in government was slightly less than moderate (mean 2.80 [SD 0.68]) ( Factors associated with COVID-19 vaccination hesitancya. |Characteristics||Odds CI)| | | | ||Male||Refb|| | (1.353-2.86)||<.001| | | ||Married||1.099 (0.642-1.882)||.73| | | ||None||Ref|| | | ||More than (0.853-2.652)||.16| | | | ||Urban||Ref|| | | (0.752-2.331)||.33| | | | ||No||Ref|| | | ||Yes||0.501 (0.337-0.746)||.001| | | ||None||Ref|| | | ||More than (0.796-1.846)||.37| | | conversion rate of 1000 won=US $0.87 is applicable. The results of the path model analysis showing the relationships between media use, psychological factors, and vaccine hesitancy are shown in Path model showing the relationships between media use, psychological factors, and vaccine hesitancy. Note: Path coefficients are standardized regression weights. Nonsignificant paths are indicated as dotted lines. * We examined the standardized parameter estimates to compare the magnitude of associations of media use on vaccine hesitancy via psychological factors (ie, perceived susceptibility and severity of COVID-19 infection, perceived benefits and barriers of COVID-19 vaccination, and trust in government). Offline media use was related to lower vaccine hesitancy indirectly via higher perceived benefits and trust in government. With regard to online media use, the indirect association through perceived severity of COVID-19 infection and perceived benefits of vaccines were significant and related to lower vaccine hesitancy. Lastly, the indirect association between social media and vaccine hesitancy via perceived susceptibility ( Standardized parameter estimates of indirect association between media use and vaccine hesitancy via mediators. |Independent variable, mediator||Vaccine ||Trust in government||0.019||0.015||.22| This study revealed a considerable level of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy at 1 month before the start of vaccination in South Korea. Among the participants, 53.3% (541/1016) hesitated to uptake the COVID-19 vaccination, 37.5% (381/1016) reported they were \"half and half\" they not\" vaccinated, while the participants would \"likely\" or \"very likely\" accept the vaccine. A decrement of vaccine acceptance was also observed in South Korea, as in other countries, from 79.8% (June 2020) to 46.7% (January 2021) [ Several additional findings are worthy of note. First, sociodemographic characteristics and health-related factors were standard subgroup variables cross-tabulated with vaccination hesitancy. Gender has emerged as a significant issue during this pandemic. Previous studies have shown that women are more likely to engage in preventive behaviors [ Second, the results revealed the association between psychological factors and vaccine hesitancy. Perceived barriers such as concerns about side effects caused by a COVID-19 vaccine had a significant and robust association with vaccine hesitancy. The perceived susceptibility of COVID-19 infection and benefits of vaccination (eg, proven efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines) related negatively to vaccine hesitancy. Trust in government was also negatively associated with vaccine hesitancy. The predictive power of psychological factors on vaccine hesitancy has been emphasized by numerous studies [ Third, this study suggests that the use of media to obtain vaccine-related information has a positive or negative relation with the population's vaccination decision-making. The mechanisms by which psychological factors mediate the association between media use and vaccine hesitancy were also revealed. Offline media such as TV, radio, and newspapers were associated with higher perceived benefits of a COVID-19 vaccine and higher trust in government, which led to lower vaccine hesitancy. Kim and Jung [ Regarding social media, frequent social media use was related to vaccine hesitancy even when other types of media use (eg, offline, online media) and sociodemographic, health-related, and psychological factors were included in the model. Social media use was related with vaccine hesitancy via perceived susceptibility in a negative direction and perceived barriers in a positive direction. This result implies that social media as a health information source could act as a double-edged sword. Social media has been criticized because it propagates more misinformation than any other media type [ A set of implications for interventions, communication strategies, and future research can be drawn from this study. Since this study was conducted a month before the start of vaccination, it provides a valuable opportunity to understand the public's responses on novel vaccines and develop practical implications for implementing effective vaccination programs in a future epidemic. First, as the perceived barrier was the highest predictor of vaccine hesitancy, efforts to lower the perceived risk of vaccine side effects and heighten perceived benefits of the vaccine are required. This study indicates that social media is related to heightened perceived barriers, thereby leading to vaccine hesitancy, which is not very surprising. The phenomenon of \"infodemics,\" defined as the rapid spread and amplification of vast amounts of valid and invalid information on the internet or through other media, is a tremendous and ongoing challenge in the COVID-19 pandemic [ This study has several limitations worthy of note. First, although there are several types of social media such as official social media, professional social media, and public social media [ This study's findings suggest that social media plays a role in disseminating vaccine-related information, especially vaccination benefits, which can help the public accept the COVID-19 vaccine for disease control. Conversely, social media can also increase concerns about a vaccination's side effects, stimulating vaccine hesitancy. Sociodemographic factors such as gender and age should be considered in public health interventions, and greater attention should be given to the younger adults and females during a pandemic for effective vaccination campaigns. This study highlights the need for government and public health authorities to consider approaching their public with additional efforts to promote acceptance of the COVID-19 vaccine. Efforts to disseminate reliable and timely information and monitor social media misinformation are needed during the pandemic. Understanding the intentions of vaccination and factors associated with the intentions may help inform public health authorities about evidence-based interventions; vaccination strategies are necessary to achieve broader community uptake. odds ratio This work was supported by the Ministry of Education of the Republic of Korea and the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF-2021S1A5B5A16075887).
