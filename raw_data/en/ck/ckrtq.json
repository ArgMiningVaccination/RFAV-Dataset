A: that's the puzzle. I actually don't think \"chemobrain\" is a good term for it because it focuses on a possible source that may or may not be the total story. Cognitive changes have been detected with chemotherapy but other factors also might be involved. my research\u2014 as well as other people's research\u2014shows that some women have cognitive differences before they ever have treatment. We've looked at women at that point after diagnosis and just before treatment and we could already detect cognitive difficulties. We can't blame it on chemotherapy, surgery or any type of treat - ment. We can't blame it on older age because we also assessed women without breast cancer of similar ages, and they didn't exhibit the same problems. Q: If it isn't caused by chemotherapy alone, then what other factors are involved? A: there are probably brain networks that are vulnerable to fatigue and stress\u2014which obviously both occur with a cancer diagnosis. We have networks that are responsible for working memory and attention that help us block out distractions and keep track of things. If these networks are vulnerable to stress and fatigue in the first place and then you add therapies that may have toxic effects, it may compound the problem. there may also be genetic factors that increase a person's sensitiv - ity to cognitive side effects of chemotherapy. And depression or menopausal symptoms could add to cognitive changes, too. so it could PeOPLe WhO hAVe unDerGOne treA tment FOr CAnCer OFten rePOrt thA t theY just DOn't seem tO Be ABLe tO thInK As CLeArLY As theY useD tO. theY hAVe trOuBLe rememBerInG thInGs FrOm One mInute tO the next. theY CAn't thInK OF the rIGht WOrD Or theY FOrGet PeOPLe's nAmes. AnD muL tItAsKInG Is sImPLY Out OF the QuestIOn. For some, the problems can be severe, leading to difficulties at work and at home. researchers have struggled to understand the syndrome that has come to be known as \"chemobrain.\" One of those researchers is Bernadine Cimprich, a u-m associate professor of nursing who has studied the cognitive func - tioning of women with breast cancer. We spoke with her about what chemobrain is and how people can cope with it. Q: How many people are affected by chemobrain? A: We believe that about one-third of women treated for breast cancer have cognitive problems that interfere with day-to-day living. But that's just an estimate. even subtle changes not easily detected on usual cognitive tests can be very bothersome. We started talking about chemobrain with the breast cancer popula - tion because the bulk of studies of cognitive problems have been focused on this group. however, we don't think it's unique to breast cancer or to women.very well be that there is more than one source for these cognitive problems. Q: What research is underway to better understand this phenom - enon? A: We opened a study this summer that uses functional mrI\u2014a type of scan that can show blood flow with brain activity\u2014to detect changes in cognitive functioning. We'll be looking at women to see if changes in attention and working memory develop, how long they last and whether they get better after chemo - therapy.

THRIVE SummER 085Q: What should people do if they suspect they have chemobrain? A: the first thing is to let your health-care team know the problems you are experiencing to see if further evaluation is needed. We can recommend a lifestyle approach to help con - serve mental energy and improve functioning. TIPS Chemobrain is probably compounded by stress and fatigue. Bernadine Cimprich, u-m associate professor of nursing, said research has found that exercise, yoga, meditation and spending time in nature have a measur - able impact in reducing fatigue. In addition, consider these lifestyle approaches: Focus on the priorities that are most important to you. Delegate tasks or leave other things undone. When you approach a task that requires a lot of mental energy, break it down into smaller goals. Don't try to multitask , especially in situations where it could be dangerous, for example, when driving or while cooking. Schedule your day in advance . Having a structure will help you complete tasks. Rely on family and friends to help you. If you're having trouble making simple decisions\u2014like meal planning\u2014 ask if they would help with decision- making and shopping. use a buddy system . For situations where you are concerned that you may be making a mistake, ask someone to look over your work. If you need to read something complex, ask someone to talk it over with you to make sure you fully understand.Understanding 'ChemoBrain' to find Better wa Ys to CoPe Bernadine Cimprich's research has found that spending time in nature has a measurable impact on reduc - ing fatigue, which probably plays a role in \"chemobrain.\" a handle on how to treat people, we need to understand what the problem is. Q: What kind of treatment is available to address cognitive problems? A: We don't have treatment for chemobrain because we're not sure what the source of the problem is. If someone's cognitive functioning is compromised, she is at high risk for further loss of functioning from stress and fatigue. We can always work to find ways to reduce stress and fatigue.

After all, a nation that could put a man on the moon could surely cure a common disease, right? nearly 40 years later, 1.5 million Americans are diagnosed with cancer each year . more than 560,000 die each year because of it\u2014roughly 1,500 people every day. And yet, for the first time since its founding, the nCI's budget was cut in 2006, leaving it today with 12 percent less buying power than it had in 2004. What does that mean? According to the nCI's annual plan, it means that each laboratory they fund nationwide may go without hiring a researcher or two. In turn, scientific progress is slowed, delaying the cure so many seek. the situation may sound grim, but it's not all bad. In fact, there's some great news: thanks to early screening and prevention, people are living longer, better quality lives after a cancer diagnosis. nearly 11 million Americans are cancer survivors\u2014a number that exceeds the population of the state of michigan. that's 11 million voices that could start a conversation with local and federal legislators to put the war against cancer back on the political agenda. Add to those voices family and friends impacted by the disease, and you have a movement. In the spirit of this election year, we've put together five tips for getting involved in the legislative process. most of us consider voting our civic duty and leave the rest to someone else. But for others, like breast cancer survivor Becky Cwiek (see sidebar, page 8 ), legislative advocacy can become a passion\u2014another way to fight back against cancer. Consider the options listed on the pages that follow.the CAnCer V ote! 5 tiPs for making YoUr voiCe heardFeAture stOrY THRIVE SummER 08 6CAnCer 7 THRIVE Sum mER 0878FeAture st OrY THRIVE SummER 08 8 Mrs. Cwiek Goes to washinGton Six years ago, Becky Cwiek was a stay-at- home mom. Ask her what she does today, and it depends on which hat she's wearing at that moment: mom, breast cancer survivor, pharmacy technician or president of the fledgling Michigan Breast Cancer Coalition. After her best friend died of breast cancer, Cwiek read a story about the National Breast Cancer Coalition. She decided to see if she could raise enough money by sending 100 letters out to friends and families asking for $10 contributions to go to the NBCC's annual conference. Cwiek's friends went above and beyond, in some cases sending $300 instead of $10. In the end, she raised $2,200\u2014enough for two years' worth of conferences. \"I was crying every time I'd go to the mailbox,\" she said. Since then, Cwiek has divided her time be - tween chatting up Michigan legislators on Capitol Hill during the NBCC's annual Lobby Day and establishing the Michigan Breast Cancer Coalition to influence policymakers in Lansing. Their goal is to \"advocate, educate and eradicate.\" The group recently obtained its non-profit status. Cwiek has also committed herself to learning as much as she can about cancer. She recently took an NBCC six-day course on molecular biology and epidemiology, and has begun to serve as a grant reviewer for the Susan G. Komen for the Cure foundation. She also serves as a member of the U-M Breast Cancer Advocacy & Advi - sory Committee, helping to provide feedback to researchers about clinical trials. \"If we can make a difference, we have to,\" Cwiek said. \"It's amazing, really. We have the ability to change laws. We just have to get smart first.\"Democrat? Republican? Survivor. Before you vote on election day, you'll sift through a lot of information to help you make your choice. As you do that, consider the unique point of view you now hold as someone who has been diagnosed with cancer. Access to health care is a key issue in the presidential campaign. Take time to learn the candidates' positions and cast your vote accordingly. Who do you think can make the biggest difference for people living with cancer? Read up. Speak out. You know how difficult it's been to deal with cancer in your personal life. It may be comforting to note that there are legions of others like you\u2014 and they're mad as hell. Just by reading a daily newspaper you can see the strides cancer advocates are making: Last fall, Texans passed an amendment to the state constitution to provide up to $3 billion in cancer research. In may, President George W. Bush signed legislation to prevent employers and insurance companies from discriminating against people who test positive for genetic alterations that may cause cancer. Go to Web sites hosted by organizations like the American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network to find out what major issues could impact cancer survivors and then let your legislators know how you feel about them. By using the Web, it's never been easier to contact legislators. Talk politics with your neighbors. We all know that's taboo, right? But cancer cuts across partisan lines. Democrats, Republicans and Independents all want to conquer cancer. In fact, both presidential candidates have been deeply affected by cancer: Sen. John mcCain is a melanoma survivor, and Sen. Barack Obama's mother died of ovarian cancer. Talk to your friends and family about how cancer has impacted your life and why you believe it's important to support initiatives to ease the burden of cancer. Join an advocacy group. You know all those yellow wristbands the Lance Armstrong Founda - tion made famous? Well, that was one of the first steps in building the foundation's Livestrong Army. It's one of several organizations building grassroots efforts to make the fight against cancer a major legislative priority. Others include the National Breast Cancer Coalition and the National Coalition for Cancer Survivorship. Each organization offers a platform of ideas they'd like to see acted on as well as tips and tools for lobbying your legislators. Annual meetings provide survivors an opportunity to see their power in numbers. Go back to \"school.\" Cancer survivors are demanding a greater role in all aspects of the war against cancer\u2014even on the front lines of research. Here at the u-m Cancer Center, the Breast Cancer Advocacy & Advisory Committee offers researchers feedback about the design of clinical trials. Nationwide, organizations sponsoring research ask survivors to help evaluate propos - als to determine which ones are most worthy for funding. To learn how to evaluate grant proposals, various advocacy groups offer survivors training programs. It's the first step in gaining entrance to meetings where some of the most influential decisions in cancer research are made. 01 02 03 04 05\" Life propels you in different ways.

But after he began treatment for his cancer, he was too tired, so he started to draw instead. \"that was when we all realized he had something special,\" his father, Al Foster said. \"When I first saw his drawings, I thought, 'that's pretty good,' and he just keeps getting better and better.\" the Fosters are one of many families who have discovered that healing therapy goes beyond what's available in the infusion area or the operating room. the conventional treatment plan developed by a ComPlementar Y, integrative mediCine offers healing10 THRIVE SummER 08COV er st OrY health-care team is the first line of attack in fighting cancer. But for many, complementary therapies serve as reinforcements. Sorting out the options As Americans have started to take more control of their medical care, they've been presented with more and more options. studies have shown that people with cancer, in particu - lar, are much more likely to try complementary or alternative medicine. But figuring what's best for you is tricky. Broadly speaking, complementary therapies are services that patients can use in conjunction with a conventional treatment plan. It may include art therapy\u2014as in the Fosters' case\u2014 music therapy, guided imagery, yoga or any of a number of other practices that help to promote a mind-body connection. \"We're interested in providing outlets for people to be inspired, to heal gently, to seek adjuncts to their regime to foster a sense of well-being,\" said Donna murphy, director of Complementary therapies at the u-m Cancer Center. \"Patients and caregivers tell us they consults with oncologists to ensure patients receive the best care possible. In addition to consultations specific to cancer care, clinic doctors also serve as primary care physicians, offering a similar blending of therapies to promote health and wellness. \"many forms of complementary therapy offer true benefit and they don't interfere with conventional medicine, so it's a win-win situation,\" Warber said. \"I think there's also a psychological empowerment that happens because these are things patients themselves decide to do. they think, 'I'm going to seek out something that's good for me,' and when they find a doctor who's willing to be an ally in that process, that's a powerful relationship.\" Learning from Children \"I taught her to draw,\" said evan Foster, tilting his head toward his twin, savannah. \"he taught me to draw; I taught him to color,\" savannah answered. For the Fosters, art is a family affair. Al Foster paints portraits for a living, but he didn't see his children's artistic talent bloom until come away from our programs with a sense of feeling uplifted in some way. the interactions help to provide them with hope in light of not knowing what their diagnosis could mean for them now and in the future.\" For those seeking a more comprehensive approach, integrative medicine blends conven - tional medicine with complementary therapy as well as alternative or traditional medicine. At the university of michigan Integrative Family medicine Clinic, physicians consult with patients to develop individualized plans to help maximize their health. these plans may incorporate supplements or traditional therapies, such as acupuncture. the clinic is designed to help patients sort out beneficial therapies from those that may be harmful, said sara L. Warber, m.D., co-director of u-m integrative medicine. Because supplements can interfere with cancer treatment, it's extremely important to pursue these options with a doctor's supervision. the Integrative Family medicine Clinic is not part of the Cancer Center, but the clinic accesses the same u-m medical records and Art is a family affair for the Fosters\u2014mostly, at least. Alphonso, far left in the photo below, prefers fishing to drawing. But twins Evan and Savannah have inherited the same passion for art as their father, Al. 10THRIVE SummER 0811after evan's diagnosis. Both savannah and evan have taken to drawing, while older son Alphonso has taken up his dad's other passion: fishing. the goal of complementary therapy is often to grease the wheels of self-expression to help people cope with the anxiety of a cancer diagnosis. most adults have the capability to talk about it, but often choose to bottle it up. Young children sometimes don't have that option at all, said jessica Doletzky, a member of the Cancer Center Child Life t eam. For kids, complementary therapies are integral. specialists guide children to use their imagination to cope with painful procedures and offer arts and crafts projects as a way to help them express feelings they might not have the words for. siblings also are encouraged to participate in these activities to help them deal with the strain cancer puts on a family. \"Our goal is to use activities, games and projects to limit anxiety and reduce stress,\" Doletzky said. \"We try to support families so they have the ability to get through painful or difficult situations a little more easily.\"CLICK More resources are available online.

After five surgeries and a life- threatening brain infection, she wants to go back and document her illness. \"I want to get that story out,\" King said. \"my vision is someday I can go to the Gilda's Club support group I attend and say, 'hi, my name is t ammy,' and hand them a notebook and say, 'here's my story if you're ever bored. I've had quite a journey.'\" King also said she would like someday to share her story with her daughter, who was 15 months old when King was diagnosed with cancer. Complementary therapies offer people a way to commemorate their experience, murphy said. this is important for survivors and also for families of those who die. \"these therapies are forms of expression and can create a tangible way to capture some of this intense and life-altering time,\" murphy said. \"Being ill is not something we think of commemorating, yet illness can often change the course of our lives. some of these activities can create touchstones for later.\" Learning to use complementary therapy to create a better sense of well-being can have life - long impact, she said. Although the challenge right now is fighting cancer, these techniques can be used to reduce stress from other sources. the key is making that mind-body connection. \"seeing the person as a whole is an essential tenet of integrative medicine,\" Warber said. \"Our patients have a mind, they have a body, they have emotions, they have spiritual needs that must be valued. We do the best medicine when we attend to all those missions. healing the whole person is every bit as important as knowing scientifically that we're treating the disease.\"Tammy King puts her expe - rience down on paper.try it yourself The u-m Cancer Center offers a number of comple - mentary therapy programs at no charge to patients and families.

Although therapists make every effort to accommodate requests while they are in the unit, they do not accept appointments. The free massages are provided by therapists specifically trained to work with people with cancer. The training is important because some forms of deep tissue massages can push extra waste\u2014or lactic acid\u2014out of muscles. For people who aren't on treatment, it might make them feel a little sore. But for people who are already coping with the toxic effects of chemotherapy, that extra bit of waste may be enough to cause flu-like symptoms. The training also teaches therapists to adjust the pressure theyapply and the direction of the massage stroke in areas where lymph nodes have been removed. This is important to ensure that massages do not contribute to lymphedema.\" \"It's about knowing how to adapt massage to the type of treatment people are receiving,\" Lundquist said. \"It's about understanding how to create less of a demand on the body.\" Studies have shown that massage may aid in decreasing anxiety and depression; improving immune function; re-es - tablishing a positive body image; increasing relaxation; improving sleep; providing pain relief; and decreasing fatigue, nausea, diarrhea and loss of appetite. Cancer care often causes people to feel alienated from their bodies, Lundquist said. Ironically, people often neglect their body's more general needs while they are focusing on treating cancer. \"I've seen people with active lifestyles who would normally deal with stress by going out for a run or a walk, and they're too tired to do that,\" she said. \"They feel almost like their body has failed them.

And this summer, continue to use caution when grilling. All animal meats produce cancer- causing chemicals when they are seared at high temperatures\u2014whether on a grill or on a con - ventional stove. It's still unclear whether eating these chemicals will increase your cancer risk. But while researchers continue to learn more about whether there's a link between grilling and cancer, consider the strategies we offer at right to limit your exposure. You can protect yourself and still enjoy a backyard barbecue. You know the blackened bits that cling to the meat? The stuff cooks love for its flavor? Well, unfortunately, that's the stuff that contains all the toxins that may increase your cancer risk. Try not to eat it and consider these tips for limiting your exposure: Limit . The most important thing you can do\u2014whether you're grilling or not\u2014is limit red meats and processed meats that contain nitrates. Choose chicken or fish instead. Marinate your meat. Research has shown that a marinade can reduce the formation of carcinogens by more than 90 percent. Experiment with vegetables and fruits . Cancer-causing chemicals only arise from grilling animal tissue. Black - ened bits on fruits and vegetables are harmless. Scale back meat portions. Consider kabobs. It's a great way to add fruits and vegetables while cutting back on meat. Limit flare-ups that char food by selecting leaner meats or grilling on aluminum foil. If you use foil, punch small holes to allow the fat to drain. Flip meat frequently to prevent it from getting too black.

The study found African-Americans were 23 percent less likely to receive chemotherapy for rectal cancer and 12 percent less likely to receive radiation therapy than whites. \"This is very important. We knew that African- Americans were not receiving chemotherapy for rectal cancer at the same rates as white Americans and it was contributing to their increased mortality. Now we have a better idea of where the problem lies: somewhere between the visit with the oncologist and the actual initiation of chemotherapy,\" said Arden Morris, M.D., M.P .H., assistant professor of surgery at the U-M Medical School. The study looked at 2,582 whites and 134 African- Americans aged 66 and older who had been diagnosed with rectal cancer. Data was pulled from a National Cancer Institute registry that collects information on cancer incidence, treatment and mortality. Long-term survival after rectal cancer surgery is up to 20 percent worse for African-Americans than for whites. At the same time, the addition of chemo - therapy and radiation is known to improve survival in all rectal cancer patients by as much as 20 percent. Researchers suspect the lack of treatment in African- Americans is largely driving the decreased survival. \"We now know that the initial visit with an oncolo - gist is not the barrier to treatment. Our next step is to better understand the human factors that contribute to this discrepancy. We're interested in hearing what individual people have to say,\" Morris said. Researchers at the University of Michigan Compre - hensive Cancer Center have found a series of markers that indicate which patients are more likely to survive cancers of the base of the tongue and tonsils. The research is a promising step toward tailored, indi - vidualized treatment for a cancer that dramatically impacts swallowing and speaking. Notably, researchers found that cancers linked to HPV, or human papillomavirus, are the most responsive to current chemotherapy and radiation treatments, while tumors that express high levels of a certain growth factor receptor are the least responsive and most deadly. HPV is the virus that can cause cervical cancer and is the target of a new vaccine. Results of the study appeared in the July 1 issue of the Journal of Clinical Oncology. \"The chemotherapy and radiation therapy we use to treat this type of cancer is very aggressive. In the study, researchers treated 66 patients with advanced cancer of the tonsils and the base of the tongue. Study participants were given an initial course of chemotherapy to gauge the tumor's response. Those whose tumor was reduced by more than half of its original size received a full course of chemotherapy and radiation simultane - ously. Patients whose tumors did not respond were referred for surgery. Fifty-four of the 66 participants responded to the initial chemotherapy. Of that group, 62 percent are alive today without evidence of cancer, and 73 percent fully preserved their organs. Participants whose cancer did not respond to the chemother - apy and radiation went on to receive surgery. The researchers found that even with surgery, only four of 11 patients survived. The researchers found 64 percent of the tumors were positive for high-risk strains of HPV. Almost all of the HPV-positive tumors responded to initial chemotherapy and 78 percent of those patients survived with their organs preserved. Of the HPV-negative study participants, only four of 15 survived. In addition, the researchers found that patients whose tumor expressed a marker called EGFR had worse outcomes. Thomas Carey, Ph.D., co-director of the U-M head and neck oncology program, works to find better ways to treat tongue and tonsil cancers. African-Ameri - cans were 23 percent less likely to receive chemotherapy for rectal cancer and 12 percent less likely to receive radiation therapy than whites. If we can identify those patients most likely to respond, we could reduce the intensity of the therapy for those likely to have the best outcomes. At the same time, we hope to identify new treatments that specifically target those tumors that we know are not responding to cur - rent therapies,\" said Thomas Carey, Ph.D., co-director of the U-M head and neck oncology program. Cancers of the tonsils and the base of the tongue have increased in recent years, in what Carey calls an \"epidemic\" of HPV-induced head and neck cancer. At the same time, declines in smoking rates have led to a decrease in the incidence of other types of head and neck cancers.
