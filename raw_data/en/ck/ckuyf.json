These impairm Chiropractors strive to diagnose and correct biomechanical disturbances and nervous system blockages. These impairments and/or blockages often create irritating symptoms such as inflammation, tension, pain, numbness, muscle spasms, and joint mobility restrictions, all of which may have an impact on the body as a whole. Chiropractors use their hands, knees, and elbows to manually adjust and twist a person's spine and joints to alter the body's nervous system and natural defensive mechanisms. Through these practices, they can relieve pain, relax muscles, reduce pressure on nerves, increase general health, and even encourage the body's natural healing process. Chiropractic care can be incredibly helpful in relieving all kinds of pain, especially back pain. How Can a Chiropractor Relieve My Back Pain? There are many different ways that a chiropractor can help with back pain. At your first appointment, they will likely ask you about your symptoms and medical history.

Based on their findings, your chiropractor will work with you to create a treatment plan specifically for you. This plan may involve one or more of the following: - Spinal Manipulation and Adjustment - One of the most common treatments that chiropractors use is spinal manipulation, also called chiropractic adjustment. This is a hands-on treatment that involves moving, massaging, and applying pressure to the spine and joints. Chiropractors use spinal manipulation to target the source of your pain and improve your range of motion. - Manual Therapies - In addition to spinal manipulation, chiropractors may also use other manual therapies to treat back pain. These include trigger point therapy, myofascial release, and massage. Each of these therapies works to release tension in the muscles, ligaments, and tendons around the spine. - Rehabilitative Exercise - Chiropractors may also prescribe rehabilitative exercises to help patients strengthen the muscles around their spine. These exercises can help prevent further injury and relieve pain. - Lifestyle and Nutritional Counseling - Chiropractors may also provide lifestyle and nutritional counseling to help patients manage their back pain. They may recommend changes to your diet, exercise routine, and sleep habits. They may also suggest ways to reduce stress.
