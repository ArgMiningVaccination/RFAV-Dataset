Vitamin C is a potent antioxidant that destroys free-radicals. Vitamin C is also needed to support the activation of the immune system. The regulation of cellular clean-up and recycling, such as autophagy and apoptosis, requires Vitamin C. Two time Nobel prize-winning chemist Linus Pauling popularized the therapeutic benefits in the 1970s when he observed that megadoses of Vitamin C prevented cold symptoms. He later built upon this research and hypothesized that Vitamin C could prevent cardiovascular disease, cancer, and early aging. More research is currently being conducted on the benefits of megadosing Vitamin C. Humans are one of the only species that cannot synthesize Vitamin C, so we must consume it in our diet. Oranges often get most of the credit for being Vitamin C rich, but there are better options. These are the top 3 foods to enhance your Vitamin C levels: - Kiwifruit: One kiwi contains 65-90% of the daily adult requirement, and kiwi's reduced the severity and duration of upper respiratory tract infection symptoms. Kiwi's are a low glycemic index food as well. - Broccoli: Broccoli is a cruciferous vegetable that helps with detoxification and contains 75-90% of the daily adult Vitamin C requirement. - Strawberries: Another fruit with a low glycemic index and glycemic load fruit! Ten strawberries contain 108 mg of Vitamin C. Research has shown that consuming strawberries, combined with other Vitamin C-rich foods, decreases the development of Alzheimer's.
