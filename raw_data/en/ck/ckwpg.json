Never mind that these vaccines were developed by some of the brightest scientific minds around, built on decades of research on how medicines can be developed more quickly and safely. Never mind that they have been thoroughly tested and found to be safe, and that we have been using vaccines for over 200 years to prevent the spread of diseases such as measles and chickenpox. If people are worried about the \"long-term\" unknown side effects of getting jabbed, they should consider the alternative set of long-term risks they are exposing themselves to. One must ask what risks they are willing to take: either this fear of some long-term unknown side effect of a vaccine, or the well-established risks that getting infected with Covid-19 brings. [side effects](https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/health-environment/article/3137568/coronavirus-hong-kong-covid-19-jabs-indemnity?module=inline&pgtype=article)of the vaccine are well known in the short term, and the risk of any long-term side-effects is minute, in the expert opinion of those who developed these vaccines. But what about the risks associated with getting infected? [many die](https://www.scmp.com/news/world/article/3103425/global-death-toll-coronavirus-tops-1-million?module=inline&pgtype=article). And the [long term](https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/health-environment/article/3118238/study-finds-80-cent-recovered-covid-19-patients?module=inline&pgtype=article)? An increasing number of studies are reporting people suffering from symptoms for many months after they were infected with Covid-19. [\"long haulers\"](https://www.scmp.com/lifestyle/health-wellness/article/3121237/long-covid-symptoms-what-its-suffer-and-why-fitness?module=inline&pgtype=article)who suffer from debilitating symptoms for months. So much remains unknown about additional long-term consequences the once-infected could face in the years to come, and what loss in quality and length of life could occur in the years after being infected. That is a much scarier prospect than any minute risk of long-term side effects from the vaccine.

For the unvaccinated, the world will never truly be safe. The virus will linger among the anti-vaccinated population, and in fact mutate into more vicious versions of itself, increasing the consequences of getting infected. If you are worried about long-term side effects, you should consider the full risks inherent in each path. Mark Pavey, Sai Wan Ho "}
