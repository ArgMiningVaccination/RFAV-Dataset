Bento1,2and Pejman Rohani1,2,3 1Odum School of Ecology,2Center for the Ecology of Infectious Diseases, and3Department of Infectious Diseases, University of Georgia, Athens Background .The increase in the incidence of whooping cough (pertussis) in many countries with high vaccination coverage is alarming. Maternal pertussis immunization has been proposed as an effective means of protecting newborns during the interval between birth and the rst routine dose. However, there are concerns regarding potential interference between maternal antibodies and the immune response elicited by the routine schedule, with possible long-term population-level effects. Methods .We formulated a transmission model comprising both primary routine and maternal immunization. This model was examined to evaluate the long-term epidemiological effects of routine and maternal immunization, together with consequences of potential immune interference scenarios. Results .Overall, our model demonstrates that maternal immunization is an effective strategy in reducing the incidence of per- tussis in neonates prior to the onset of the primary schedule. However, if maternal antibodies lead to blunting, incidence increases among older age groups. For instance, our model predicts that with 60% routine and maternal immunization coverage and 30%blunting, the incidence among neonates (0 -2 months) is reduced by 43%. Under the same scenario, we observe a 20% increase in incidence among children aged 5 -10 years. However, the downstream increase in the older age groups occurs with a delay of approximately a decade or more. Conclusions .Maternal immunization has clear positive effects on infant burden of disease, lowering mean infant incidence. However, if maternally derived antibodies adversely affect the immunogenicity of the routine schedule, we predict eventual popu- lation-level repercussions that may lead to an overall increase in incidence in older age groups. Keywords. pertussis; maternal immunization; routine vaccination; interference; blunting. Pertussis is an extremely contagious respiratory disease caused by the Bordetella pertussis bacterium. Historically, pertussis was considered one of the great microparasitic diseases of child- hood, accounting for >4000 annual deaths in the United Stated during the prevaccination era [ 1]. The introduction of infant vaccination in the 1940s -1950s in industrialized nations was ex- tremely effective in reducing severe disease and mortality [ 2,3]. However, the early successes of routine vaccination have givenway to resurgence in a number of countries boasting high cov- erage [ 2]. The continued circulation of pertussis, both in devel- oping and developed countries, as reported by the WorldHealth Organization [ 4], has raised serious concerns regarding the effectiveness of current vaccination strategies [ 3,5,6]. De- spite the reported high levels of vaccine coverage, there is still substantial pertussis-related morbidity and mortality, especiallyin infants who have not yet started or completed the primary vaccination schedule [ 7,8]. During this window of vulnerability,newborns are susceptible to pertussis infection as a result of contact with infected siblings [ 9] or parents and other caregivers [2]. In high-vaccine-coverage settings experiencing increasing pertussis incidence, a shift has been observed in the demogra- phy of cases, with increasing frequency of cases in teens andyoung adults [ 10,11]. This development has led to the introduc- tion of a booster for adolescents in the United States, Australia, and France, among other countries [ 12]. The contemporary epidemiology of pertussis is subject to much debate, with a number of candidate explanations put forward for the observed increase in some countries. These range from a trueincrease to explanations focusing on improved diagnostics andsurveillance [ 3,4]. Proposed non -mutually exclusive explanations for a true resurgence include the evolution of the bacterium [ 13, 14], vaccine ef cacy [ 12,15],waning immunity [ 16], a drop in cov- erage due to exemptions [ 17] ,a n dt h ee n do ft h eh o n e y m o o ne f - fect [ 18]. Given the uncertainty in the underlying causes of the resurgence, identifying effective programs for reducing the pertus-sis burden has proved elusive [ 6]. The picture is made more blurred in part by the heterogeneity in vaccine use. Many coun- tries, particularly low- and middle-income nations, use whole-cellvaccines, as they are inexpensive and easy to manufacture, whilemost developed countries have switched to acellular vaccines [ 4]. A priority for any vaccination policy is the protection of neo- nates, who are at highest risk of severe morbidity, hospitalization,Correspondence: A. I.

In principle, if the circulation of a pathogen is success- fully reduced through suf ciently high levels of routine vaccina- tion, then even those unvaccinated are afforded protection \u2014a concept known as \"herd immunity \"[19]. Recent experience, es- pecially in some countries using the acellular pertussis vaccines, has raised doubts regarding the potential success of routine im-munization strategies alone. Hence, the attention has shifted to- ward vaccination programs aimed squarely at protecting infants, including vaccination of likely contacts ( \"cocooning \")[20] and the immunization of pregnant women, with the 2-fold aim of re-ducing disease incidence in mothers and the placental transfer of protective antibodies to newborns [ 4,21].Because newborns have an immature immune system [ 22-29],maternal antibodies (Mat- Abs) play an important role in their rst months of life [ 30]. Thus, maternal immunization (pregnancy booster) aims to boost speci c antibodies in pregnant women and provide direct antenatal protection [ 9,12]. Speci cally, during the antenatal pe- active transfer of vaccine-induced immunoglobulin G (IgG) [ 31], with the intention of providing time-limited protection from vac-cine-preventable infectious diseases in infants <3 months of age. These high levels of IgG may therefore narrow the vulnerability time window prior to infant routine vaccination [ 32]. Currently, only 2 vaccines are speci cally recommended dur- ing pregnancy: in fluenza and DTaP (diphtheria, tetanus, andacellular pertussis) [ 33]. Tetanus vaccination of pregnant women has been used for years with great success, signi cantly reducing neonatal deaths [ 34]. Unfortunately, this is not always the case; MatAbs may interfere with adaptive immune respons- es, depending on the ratio of MatAbs and routine vaccination antigen levels (a phenomenon known as epitope masking)[35].This phenomenon has been documented for some live vac- cines (eg, measles), where MatAbs, even in minute quantities, signicantly lessen vaccine response [ 36]. In the rst half of the 20th century, studies were conducted on placental transmission of pertussis antibodies as well as on naturally occurring antibodies in young infants to investigate the similarity in characteristics compared to antibodies pro-duced by vaccination [ 37-39]. Studies using different formula- tions of the whole-cell vaccine, by Kendrick and colleagues [ 40], Bradford and Slavin [ 41 ], Cohen and Scadron [ 37], and later by Cashman [ 39], all showed that the presence of pertussis mater- nal antibodies in neonates did not appear to have a signi cant blunting effect (attenuation of pertussis antibody responses) onthe subsequent whole-cell imm unization routine schedules. These studies were instrumental in establishing the role of nat- ural and vaccine-induced maternal immunity in newborns. However, recent studies on pertussis maternal immunizationusing acellular vaccines have reported interference effects on in- fant immune responses to vaccination [ 42-44]. For instance, Ladhani and colleagues report a 33% -50% reduction in pertus- toxin (PT), lamentous hemagglutinin (FHA), and mbriae (FIM) titers in infants whose mothers were immu- nized [ 42]. An important epidemiological step remains to estab- lish the population-level and long-term implications of these Table 1.

The 5 epidemiological compart- ments are maternal immunized (Mv), routine vaccinated (V), susceptible (S), infected (I), and recovered (R).

Routine infant vaccination oc-curs at 2, 4, and 6 months of age. It is implemented by moving, with probability (corresponding to the vaccine coverage), those susceptible or maternally vaccinated individuals who age out of their 2-, 4-, or 6-month age categories into the vaccinated (V) class of age 3, 5, or 7 months, respectively.

S206 \u0081CID 2016:63 (Suppl 4) \u0081Bento and Rohaniresults, a challenging task given the absence of a serological cor- relate of protection. With this in mind, we developed an age-structured transmis- sion model and designed a study to explore the epidemiological outcomes of maternal immunization in various scenarios of routine coverage. In particular, we examined the long-term con-sequences of potential immunological interference resulting from maternal immunization. Speci cally, we assumed blunting resulting in primary vaccine failure (the failure to mount a pro-tective immune response after receiving a dose). We were inter-ested in titrating the implications of maternal immunization and potential blunting on infant incidence (0 -2m o n t h so f age), the overall mean age of infection across the population. METHODS Model Formulation We implemented a standard compartmental transmissionmodel [ 6,45] for pertussis. The model structure is depicted in Figure 1. Our model consists of 5 epidemiological compart- ments: maternal immunized (Mv), routine vaccinated (V), sus-ceptible (S), infected (I), and recovered (R). Newborns are assumed susceptible (S) if their mothers were not vaccinated during pregnancy; otherwise they enter a protected class( M v ) .U p o ni n f e c t i o n ,i n d i v i duals progress to the infectious (I) and ultimately the recovered (R) class. The model structure is motivated by previous research that has carried out statistical tting of transmission models to pertussis incidence reports [45-47]. Our model is comprised of 18 age classes: twelve 1-month infant age classes and 1 -4 years, 5 -9y e a r s ,1 0 -14years, 15 -19 years, 20 -44 years, and 45 years. Routine infant vaccination occurs at 2, 4, and 6 months of age to mimic the protective effects afforded following the receipt of 3 doses ofpertussis vaccine. It is implemented by moving, with probability (corresponding to the vaccine coverage), those susceptible or maternally vaccinated individuals who age out of their 2-, 4-, or6-month age categories into the vaccinated (V) class of age 3, 5, or 7 months, respectively. Individuals in the routine vaccinated class may lose immunity at rate . Similarly; we assume mater- nally derived immunity wanes at a xed rate M. We emphasize that rates of waning are exponentially distributed, meaning that many will lose immunity faster than the population average. The average infectious period (1/ )w a s xed at 15 days [ 3, 18]. The per capita birth and death rates were xed at == 1/75 per year. Finally, we assume that routine vaccina- tion affords protection lasting, on average, 75 years. Whilethere is considerable discussion regarding the nature and dura- tion of pertussis vaccine protection [ 48-50], we have chosen this particular value to pinpoint the epidemiological impacts of ma-ternal immunization and, in particular, immunological interfer-ence. We assumed a basic reproduction number, R 0of 10 [ 49]. Note that we can quantify an individual-level \"vaccine impact \" measure, ,a sd e ned by Magpantay et al [ 51], such that eradication requires vaccine uptake to exceed the threshold c=( 1 - 1 / R0)/. Thus, under our parameterization, cexceeds 1, indicating that eradication via routine immunization is notpossible. The model equations and associated parameter values are presented in detail in the Supplementary Materials, Section 1.2and in Table 1. Contact Network Data and R0Estimation Our model incorporated empirical age-speci c contact rates from the POLYMOD study in Great Britain [ 52], corrected for reciprocity as detailed by Riolo and Rohani [ 6](Supplemen- tary Figure 1 ). We constructed a WAIFW (Who Acquires Infection From Whom) matrix to describe the transmission rate between dif- ferent age groups ( Supplementary Figure 1.1 ). The basic repro- duction number, R0, for our model was calculated using the next-generation method [ 53]. Scenario Analysis We examined 2 scenarios for the routine vaccination coverage = 60% and = 98%. Maternal vaccination coverage levels con- sidered were M= 30%, 60%, and 90% (Table 1). We incorpo- rated maternal vaccination assuming blunting effects rangingfrom none, to low (corresponding to 10% primary vaccine fail-ure), to high (equivalent to 50% primary vaccine failure). These blunting effects assume interference manifests as primary vac- cine failure, based on serological [ 42], not clinical data. For every combination of parameters explored, we simulated the model with routine immunization for 200 years before intro- ducing maternal immunization and simulating for a further Figure 2.

Levels of routine vaccination coverage (no vaccination [0%], 30%, 60%, 90%, and 98%) and their effects on prevalence and mean age of infection in the different age groups. Mean age of infection is 5.9 years in the absence of vaccination, and 11.6, 19.9, and 38 years for uptake levels of 30%, 60%,and 98%, respectively. Eradication is not attainable, even with our assumption of a vaccine 100% effective, as we also assume it is imperfect in duration, with waning vaccine-derived immunity with a mean duration of protection of 75 years. Consequences of Maternal Immunization \u0081CID 2016:63 (Suppl 4) \u0081S207200 years (reaching endemic equilibrium). The presented re- sults on age-speci c incidence and the overall age at infection were based on model predictions at year 400. Note that our model predictions have not been downsampled to include the effects of potential underreporting and hence represent the\"true\"pertussis prevalence in our simulated populations. RESULTS Routine Vaccination and the Window of Susceptibility In Figure 2, we show that in the absence of routine vaccination, the combined prevalence among infants aged 0 -2 months is al- most 797 per 100 000, with a peak in the older age groups of 487 per 100 000 among 1- to 5-year-olds. The inclusion of routineimmunization at, for example, 60%, reduces infant pertussis prevalence to 277 per 100 000 and not only reduces the peak prevalence in older ages to 161 per 100 000 but also shifts thisburden to 5- to 10-year-olds. We emphasize that while a routine coverage level of 98% leads to an order of magnitude reductionin the peak prevalence (40 per 100 000) compared with the vac- cine-free scenario, the pertussis burden on the youngest infant groups remains in excess of 106 per 100 000. A useful means ofquantifying the impact of vaccination on pertussis circulation is to calculate the mean age at infection [ 47]. We nd this measure to be 5.9 years in the absence of vaccination, and 11.6, 19.9, and38 years for uptake levels of 30%, 60%, and 98%, respectively. Maternal Vaccination Interference Effects on Routine Vaccination (Blunting) In Figure 3, we illustrate the potential epidemiological consequenc- es of maternal immunization assuming different interference of MatAbs with routine vaccination. The gure demonstrates that maternal immunization successfully reduces the burden of Figure 3. Blunting effects of maternal immunization (Mat vac) on prevalence in both 60% and 98% routine vaccination coverage scenarios. The red line (routine v accination coverage) is used as a baseline. Blunting (0%, 10%, 30%) here is shown as different levels of primary vaccine failure. Decreases in infant burden (0 -3 months) are observed with maternal immunization. Increased blunting effects have consequences in increasing prevalence in the older age classes. S208 \u0081CID 2016:63 (Suppl 4) \u0081Bento and Rohanipertussis in the youngest infant age groups. In the absence of blunting, 60% routine and maternal immunization coverageleads to a 50% reduction in prevalence among neonates (0 -2 months), compared with the routine vaccination alone. If the pres- ence of MatAbs leads to a 30% risk of vaccine failure, the neonateprevalence is reduced by 43%. However, these gains come at a cost. Under the same scenario, we observe an 18% increase in preva- lence among 5- to 10-year olds. Not surprisingly, when routine coverage reaches 98%, blunting assumes greater importance as the maternal vaccination coverage increases. When maternal immunization coverage is 60%, in-creasing blunting from 10% to 30% to 50% translates to both in- creasing prevalence among neonates (57, 71, and 87 per 100 000, respectively) as well as higher transmission to older age groups(5-10 years: 48, 85, and 122 per 100 000, respectively). Importantly, Figure 3captures the key tradeoff that may re- sult if MatAbs lead to blunting, or \"wasted \"routine vaccines (supported by Supplementary Figures 5 -8). High maternal im- munization coverage (60% or 90%) is shown to be successful in substantially reducing neonatal pertussis. Depending on the strength of blunting, however, this strategy will inevitably alsolead to higher prevalence among the older age groups. Assum- ing 98% routine coverage, 60% prenatal vaccination, and 30% blunting, we observe an almost 4-fold increase in prevalenceamong 5- to 10-year-olds (122 per 100 000) in comparisonwith the absence of maternal immunization (32 per 100 000). Our elasticity analyses are aimed to identify relative marginal gains and losses around speci c baseline parameters as mater- nal immunization and blunting values vary. These analyses show that at 98% routine vaccination coverage with low blunt- ing (around 10%), prevalence is more sensitive to changes inmaternal vaccination (rather than changes in blunting levels). In contrast, at high levels of routine and maternal vaccination, incidence is more sensitive to changes in blunting levels ( Sup- plementary Figure 8 ). Mean Age of Infection As with the prevalence, blunting levels increase the overall levels of transmission, naturally leading to a reduction in age at infec-tion. This is illustrated in Figure 4, as well as in Supplementary Figures 5 and 7 . In both routine vaccination coverage scenarios, as routine vaccination increases, so does the mean age at infec-tion increases. However, increasing maternal vaccination cover-age leads to a reduction in the mean age at infection, with the severity of this effect greatest with very high blunting levels. The effects of blunting are more pronounced with higher maternalvaccination coverage. This is supported by our elasticity analysis (Supplementary Figures 5 -8). DISCUSSION Routine infant immunization is intended to simultaneously re- duce disease burden and reduce transmission, thereby provid- ing indirect protection to unvaccinated individuals in the population [ 19]. In the case of pertussis, with ongoing concerns about the protectiveness of contemporary (acellular) vaccines and the general increase in incidence reported in a number of countries, reliance on indirect protection of infants in the rst Figure 4. Mean age of infection (years) at different coverage levels of routine vaccination (60% and 98%) 10%, 30%, 50%) here is shown as different levels of primary vaccine failure.Effects of increasing blunting effects on mean age of infection (years) are quantified. Consequences of Maternal Immunization \u0081CID 2016:63 (Suppl 4) \u0081S2092 months of life who are too young to be immunized is unwise. For a signi cant reduction of the infant pertussis burden, atten- tion has turned toward safe immunization strategies targetingearly life, in particular through maternal vaccination. Its pur- pose is to vaccinate pregnant mothers in the third trimester with the aim of directly protecting the mother and, through pla-cental transfer of antibodies, the neonate. In the Netherlands, a cost-effectiveness analysis study by Westra and colleagues [ 54] showed that maternal immunization was found to be ef cient in lowering infants 'incidence. Recently, maternal pertussis immu- nization, under an acellular vaccination regime, has been rec- ommended in the United States and in the United Kingdom (vaccination made available to all women in their 27- to 36-week period of each pregnancy when IgG transplacental trans- fer is at its highest) [ 5,30],as part of a plethora of disease control strategies, not only for the mother and the developing fetus butalso to the newborn, to reduce the burden of pertussis at pop- ulation level [ 55]. Similar recommendations were adopted to protect newborns in Argentina, Belgium, Israel, New Zealand,Uruguay, Costa Rica, Mexico, Panama, and Brazil [ 56,57]. However, one possible issue that has been raised regarding the use of maternal immunization is that antibodies produced as a result of vaccination during pregnancy will attenuate or in-terfere with the elicitation of an immune response to the prima- ry routine vaccination, an effect often referred to as blunting. Several studies at the end of the 20th and, more recently, inthe 21st century have examined antibody responses in individ- uals who received DTP (whole-cell vaccine) as part of the rou- tine schedule and who had high levels of maternally inducedantibodies. These individuals had a reduced PT antibody re- sponse, which determines the severity of pertussis in unprotected newborns [ 57]. In a more recent study, Ladhani and colleagues [42] compared historical cohort data where mothers had not been vaccinated while pregnant with infants whose mothers were vaccinated. They found that infants had high pertussis an- tibodies concentrations prior to rst routine dose (acellular vac- cine), with PT signi cantly increasing postimmunization. However was noted where FHA levels were signi - cantly lower postvaccination (see also [ 43,44]). The mechanisms of protection need to be better understood; protection against disease might be stronger and longer than predicted by antibody titers alone [ 58]. Currently, because there are no known serologic correlates of protection to pertussis [ 59], there is uncertainty regarding the na- ture, degree, and duration of vaccine immunity, and by implica-tion the clinical consequences of these serological observations.Our study quanti es the potential effects of interference by mater- nal immunization assuming the pattern of antibody responses ob- served by Ladhani et al [ 42] results in primary routine vaccination failure (see also [ 43,44]). If changes in antibody responses do not adversely affect protection afforded by routine vaccination, the epidemiological bene ts of maternal immunization are clear(Figure 3;Supplementary Figures 2 and 3 ). As we show in Fig- ures3and4, neonates bene t from maternally induced immunity, leading to a reduction in prevalence. Our results complement the conclusions drawn by Terranella et al [ 60], who demonstrated that Tdap maternal vaccination would lead to fewer cases, hospitaliza- tions, and deaths compared with other control strategies such asother cocooning strategies (eg, postpartum vaccination). We an- ticipate that similar ndings would result if blunting effects are transient. However, our modeling results anticipate a potential down- stream risk associated with MatAbs interference \u2014namely, an eventual increase in prevalence among older age groups. Simu- lations indicate these effects may take a decade or more to bemade manifest. The magnitude of these repercussions at the population level is dependent on the severity of MatAbs inter- ference (Figure 4). Ultimately, the robustness of our modeling conclusions will be determined by additional empirical information. We hope additional light will be shed on this issue from the ongoing ran-domized, double-blind study of maternal pertussis vaccines inCanada and a recently completed US trial. These studies will help clarify the possible blunting effects of maternal antibodies on infant immune response to routine vaccination schedulingand, crucially, whether these effects may simply correspond to an effective reduction in vaccine \"take \"(as we have assumed here), or perhaps a failure in vaccine \"degree \"or the duration of protection [ 61,62]. Ultimately, long-term clinical data from settings such as the United Kingdom, where maternal immuni- zation has been practiced since 2012, will be necessary to testthe veracity of the epidemiological predictions of our model, speci cally the potential increases in incidence among older age groups. We submit that empirically validated transmission models may play a role in answering a number of remaining policy questions \u2014for example, whether maternal immunization is most effective as standard policy or more suitable as a mea-sure during an outbreak. Similarly, it remains to be seen whether MatAbs interference is observed when the routine schedule includes at least 1 dose of the whole-cell vaccine,as pertinent to low- and middle-income countries. Finally, our results are predicated on the empirically demonstrated assumption that maternally derived antibodies persist in in-fants for an average of 6 months [ 42,63]. A potentially fruit- ful avenue for further research is optimizing the routine schedule, such that the rst dose is administered perhaps at a later age, depending on the blunting effects of lingeringmaternal antibodies.
