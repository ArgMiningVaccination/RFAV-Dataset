As practicing journeyers, we have seen the incredible benefits in allowing plants to assist in our healing process. Our ceremonies are unique. We pride ourselves on comfort, trust and compassion; all necessary components in receiving deep, transformative experiences. It's our hope that with our guidance and expertise, you'll find your journey to be connective, introspective and liberating. We've outlined our pre-ceremony protocol, as well as a brief overview of what to expect, items to bring, how to arrive in a peaceful mindset and helpful post-ceremony suggestions for integration.
