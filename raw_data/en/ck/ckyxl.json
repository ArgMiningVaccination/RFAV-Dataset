The body has multiple methods in which [detoxification](http://haydeninstitute.com/detoxification) occurs: mucus, ear wax, tears, breathing, sweating, defecation, and urination are the main ones. However, our system can be overloaded and not be able to keep up with the detoxification process. When this happens, these toxins are stored in three areas of the body: Joints, Fat, and Brain (60% fat). Acupuncture has been the most used method of treating conditions in the orient for thousands of years. Detoxification with acupuncture has been used to cleanse the body and balance the meridian system which helps nourish the different functions of the body. In our Pearland office, we have seen certain acupuncture points to have a diuretic effect on the body. The urinary tract is one of the most used methods of detoxification. Acupuncture has been used extensively in drug detoxification programs. Another of the main detoxification methods is defecation. Many patients have reported improved voiding of the bowels the day after getting acupuncture. Acupuncture aids in reducing food appetite or cravings. Therefore, foods that are associated with adding toxic stress to our bodies have a decreased appeal to us. Our weight loss patients have reported that these toxic foods only create feelings of heaviness and have a decreased taste. However, when the proper foods are consumed, it has a much more flavorful taste and is more desirable. Our body knows what it needs. Acupuncture helps remind us. Detoxification and weight loss walk hand in hand. Want to enhance your detoxification and lose weight? Do something about it, and start making changes today.
