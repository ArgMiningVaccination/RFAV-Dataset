Golden Lotus Spiritual Healing looks at what is causing the symptoms, and heals issues at all levels: mental, emotional, physical and spiritual. We use a process of peeling away all of the layers of life experience, such as beliefs, fears, identity pieces, wounds, traumas, and past conditioning that are not truly you, so that your true spirit can shine through. Your soul or true essence is made of light, love, clarity, wisdom, compassion, peacefulness, integrity, and whatever your unique gifts are. As your true self, you feel alive, passionate, creative, clear, strong, and available to yourself, others, and life. What are you ready to heal? Energy healing works just as well on animals as it does for people. Jacquie can assist your pet in reducing pain and suffering due to old age, arthritis, injuries, and illnesses. She can help clear any trauma from accidents or abuse. The energy healing work is helpful in the healing and rejuvenation of your pet's organs, clearing and balancing of their energy systems, and emotional healing due to any kind of stress. Your pet can't always tell you what is wrong. If there is a problem, the energy healing work can address it. Animal healing is done primarily over the phone. Jacquie Fruttero has been a spiritual healer, animal healer, and teacher of spiritual healing for the past 8 years. She has received training as a spiritual healer from Djwhal Khul, \"The Tibetan\". She has trained with Kathryn Keeton, who has been a spiritual teacher, healer, and conscious channel for the Ascended Masters for the last 25 years. Jacquie's background includes bachelors of arts from U.C. Berkeley, certification in project management in the technological industry, bilingual K-8 teaching credential, teacher of K and 2nd grade for 5 years at the top dual immersion school in America, and 3 years working with emotionally disturbed children and their families to develop functional life skills. She spent one year of her college education in Beijing, China. She speaks English, Spanish and some Mandarin Chinese. Jacquie decided to train as a spiritual healer after she received complete healing on a deep traumatic wound that she had been working with and trying to completely heal for 16 years. When this healing took place in 4 sessions over one month's time, she felt that she had found her next calling. The way that Kathryn and the Ascended Masters train healers is threefold. First, they take each student through their own deep healing and soul recovery process. Second, they teach ancient and futuristic healing tools which allow the person to reconnect with the highest-level divine energies in our universe. Third, they share soul-level healing techniques with each student and oversee the practical application of these healing tools in a hands-on training program. I was able to heal and reclaim parts of myself that I thought were permanently damaged and gone. I decided to make it my mission to help others heal and release whatever has happened to them along the way that made them feel that they have lost the best parts of themselves. Jacquie has always loved animals, children, and nature. Through her work at Golden Lotus Spiritual Healing and the Mother Earth Healing Foundation, she is able to help adults, children, animals, and the earth heal their painful pasts, reclaim the most sacred parts of themselves, and create a brighter future. Success stories with clearing and balancing the energy systems, physical injuries, cancer, tumors, migraines, depression, grief from the loss of a loved one, clearing blocks in any area of your life, clearing negative energies from you-your pets-your work space-your home, emotional traumas, nerves, anxiety, panic attacks, fears, addictions, and much more. Jacquie and her guides, Ascended Master teachers Djwhal Khul, Mother Mary, Kuan Yin, St. Germaine, Archangel Michael, and Archangel Raphael, invite you to experience this extraordinary form of spiritual healing. If you would like to sign up for a 45-minute introductory healing, please call Jacquie. Skype and phone sessions are available nationally and internationally. I absolutely love helping people find themselves again. To live from their soul, their true essence, with joy, love and their own inner wisdom. Assisting individuals find what is causing their \"symptoms\" or blocks in their life and resolving them 100% is truly amazing. There are components to just about everything that include: choices we have made that no longer serve us, present and past life experiences, family history, genetics, soul lessons and more. So for me, I love a challenge to figure out the puzzle pieces with each person's story. With their 100% commitment to getting better, anything is possible. "}
