Steps taken by the Government of India for COVID-19 containment and management The Government of India continued to closely monitor the evolving nature of COVID-19 pandemic in India as well as globally. A close watch was also kept on improving knowledge about the virus, the disease, its long-term impacts, advancements being made in India as well as globally in terms of public health tools, diagnostics, therapeutics and vaccines. The various technical bodies under various Ministries/Departments continued to maintain a close watch over the evolving nature of the causative virus and their public health implications. India continued its graded yet pre-emptive and proactive approach towards COVID-19 management. The COVID-19 trajectory in India experiences a sharp increase during March-May 2021, however, since May 2021, the trajectory has witnessed a considerable and sustained decline. Owing to Government of India's five-fold strategy of test-track-treat-vaccinate and COVID appropriate behavior through a Whole of Government & Whole of Society approach, India has been able to limit its cases and deaths per million to 32,775 cases per million and 389 deaths per million population (as on 25th November 2022) respectively, which is one of the lowest in the world as compared to similarly affected countries. The Hon'ble Prime Minister provided the much required strong and decisive leadership and guidance for national response to the pandemic. The Prime Minister Office and Ministry of Health & Family Welfare has been in regular interactions with the all States and UT administrations to review the preparedness and response measures being taken and also to identify areas for further improvement and coordination. The Committee of Secretaries under Cabinet Secretary took regular reviews with all related Ministries of Health, Defence, Ministry of External Affairs, Civil Aviation, Home, Textiles, Pharma, Commerce and other officials including with State Chief Secretaries. The Joint Monitoring Group (JMG) under the Chairmanship of DGHS and National Task Force on COVID-19 under ICMR continue to assess the risk, review the preparedness & response mechanisms and finalize technical guidelines. The Government of India, based on its past experience of successfully managing pandemics and epidemics in the past and the evolving evidence based contemporary knowledge about the disease, provided the requisite strategy, plans and procedures to the State Governments and UT administrations. This includes containment plans and guidelines on a wide range of subjects related to travel, behavioral & psycho-social health, surveillance, laboratory support, hospital infrastructure, clinical management, rational use of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) etc. Taking note of the evolving COVID-19 situation globally and emergence of mutant variants of SARS-CoV-2 virus, the guidelines for international arrivals were reviewed from time to time. The last updated guidelines were issued on 21st November 2022. As per the updated guidelines, all international travellers to India should preferably be fully vaccinated as per the approved primary schedule of vaccination against COVID-19 in their Country. The updated guidelines also prescribe precautionary measures to be followed like preferable use of masks and adherence to physical distancing measures. There is no need to submit any details about COVID-19 vaccination status or RT-PCR testing for traveling to India. Union Ministry of Health & FW is coordinating and collaborating with other stakeholder Ministries/departments including Ministry of Civil Aviation, Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Waterways, Ministry of Railways etc. Further Port/Airport Health Officers at International ports/ airports have been instructed to ensure strict health screening of all passengers and if passengers found to be symptomatic during screening shall be immediately isolated, taken to a designated medical facility as per health protocol. Further, the Union Ministry of Health & Family Welfare is in regular interaction with all States/UTs through formal communication as well as through video conferencing. States/UTs have been urged to undertake the following activities: - Strict monitoring of International travelers in the community. - Contact tracing of positive individuals & follow up for 14 days. - Genome sequencing of positive samples through INSACOG Labs in a prompt manner. - Continued monitoring of areas where clusters of positive cases emerge. - Further strengthening of COVID-19 testing infrastructure and ensuring early identification of cases through adequate testing across the States. - Ensure preparedness of health infrastructure (availability of ICU, Oxygen supported beds, ventilators, etc.) and upgrade health infrastructure under ECRP-II including in rural areas and for pediatric cases. - Commissioning all PSA plants, ensuring sufficient logistics, drugs etc. - Ensure rapid COVID-19 vaccine coverage. - Ensuring adherence to COVID Appropriate Behaviour.

With the intent to develop long term capacities in preparedness for future surges of COVID-19 and other public health emergencies, PM Ayushman Bharat Health Infrastructure Mission (PM-ABHIM) has been approved with an outlay of Rs. 64,180 crores over 6 years. The PM-ABHIM envisages increased investments in public health and other health reforms to safeguard against future resurgences of COVID-19, if any, and future public health emergencies by: - Strengthening of Health and Wellness Centers in villages and cities for early detection of diseases - Addition of new critical care-related beds at district level hospitals. - Operationalization of Regional National Centers for Disease Control (NCDC). - Establishment of metropolitan units in urban areas and BSL-III labs across the country to strengthen the laboratory network. - Strengthening of existing Viral Diagnostic and Research Labs (VRDLs) and creation of new National institutes of Virology (NIVs) and a National Institute for One Health through ICMR. - Strengthening of Public Health Units at international Points of Entry (PoEs) The Government of India will continue to maintain a close watch over the evolving pandemic. 2. Ayushman Bharat: Ayushman Bharat comprises of two components: - The first component pertains to creation of 1,50,000 Health and Wellness Centres (AB-HWCs) by upgrading the Sub Health Centres (SHCs) and rural and urban Primary Health Centres (PHCs), in both urban and rural areas, to bring health care closer to the community. These centres aim to provide Comprehensive Primary Health Care (CPHC), by expanding and strengthening the existing Reproductive & Child Health (RCH) and Communicable Diseases services and by including services related to Non-Communicable Diseases (common NCDs such as, Hypertension, Diabetes and three common cancers of Oral, Breast and Cervix) and incrementally adding primary healthcare services for mental health, ENT, Ophthalmology, Oral health, Geriatric and Palliative care and Trauma care as well as health promotion and wellness activities like yoga. A few States/UTs have already started rolling out these additional packages in a phased manner. - The second component is the Ayushman Bharat-Pradhan around poor and vulnerable families identified as per Socio-Economic Caste Census are entitled for health cover of Rs. 5.00 lakh per family per year for secondary and tertiary care hospitalization. As on 25th Nov 2022, 3.8 crore hospital admissions have been authorised worth more than 47,000 crore, 28,636 hospitals empanelled, 20.02 crore Ayushman cards issued, 33 States/UTs implementing the scheme, approximately 50% of Ayushman card recipients are women and 46% of the hospitals empanelled are private. - Comprehensive Primary Health Care (CPHC) through Ayushman Bharat Health and Wellness Centres (AB-HWCs) - Ayushman Bharat aims to holistically address health (covering preventive, promotive, curative, rehabilitative and palliative care), at primary, secondary and tertiary level by adopting a continuum of care approach. In the lifetime of an individual, the primary healthcare services cater to 80-90% of the healthcare needs for improved healthcare outcomes and quality of life of the population. - The Primary Health Care team ensures that community outreach and population enumeration are done for individuals in their catchment area and screened for communicable diseases and non-communicable diseases for early detection and timely referral for accurate diagnosis. The team further ensures that treatment adherence and follow-up care are provided to the patients in the community. These centres are aimed at delivering primary healthcare services closer to the people and be the first point of contact for healthcare provisioning and referral for secondary and tertiary care. Thus, the essential health services along with the provisioning of essential medicines and diagnostics are provided closer to the community through these centres, as a step towards building stronger and resilient primary healthcare systems which cater to the healthcare needs of the population. 2.1 Achievement and Service Delivery at AB-HWCs: - As reported by the States/UTs on the AB-HWC Portal, 1,41,830 Health & Wellness Centres have been operationalized till 26th December, 2022. - As per the data update done by the States/UTs in HWC Portal, till date, 29,94,26,521screenings have been done for hypertension and 25,55,27,170 screenings done for diabetes at these AB-HWCs.

National Programme for Tobacco Control and Drug Addiction Treatment [NPTCDAT] - Continuous steps are being taken to increase awareness on ill-effects of tobacco use. Under the National Tobacco Control Programme, digitization has been encouraged and an online portal/Management of Informatics System has been developed for the States to provide online reporting of the activities down from the district level. States too are appreciating the importance of the Online reporting / real time data and are participating in this wholeheartedly. - India has been committed towards tobacco control. Taking forward the agenda and pursuing the international commitments, India assumed the Presidency of the Meeting of Parties Bureau, to support Parties (countries) to implement the Protocol to Eliminate Illicit Trade in Tobacco Products. - The Ministry under the Cigarettes and Other Tobacco Products (Prohibition of Advertisement and Regulation of Trade and Commerce, Production, Supply and Distribution) Act, 2003 (COTPA 2003) has notified the new specified health warnings to be displayed on all tobacco product packs, which came into effect on 1st December, 2022. The Image 1 will be effective from December 2022 and Image 2 will be displayed from 1st December 2023. The graphic health warnings are a potent tool to create awareness about the serious and adverse health consequences of tobacco usage especially among the youth, children and illiterate persons. | | Image 1 | | Image 2 | | | | | | | | | | 1st December, 2022 - 30th November, 2023 | | 1st December, 2023 - 30th November, 2024 | || || || | - Non Nicotine Replacement Therapy (NRT): The Non Nicotine Replacement Therapy (NRT) has been included in the National List of Essential Medicine (NLEM), 2022. This will facilitate the States to procure the NRT through National Health Mission and hence the availability of the drug would be more to the potential clients/patients. - Substance Use Disorders (SUDs) includes a spectrum of problems caused by the persistent misuse of mind altering substances, and can range from a harmful use to dependence. Considering the importance that physicians are able to effectively identify, diagnose and manage the problems of substance use disorder, the \"Standard Treatment Guidelines for the Management of Substance Use Disorders and Behavioural Addictions'' was released. These Guidelines have been developed as a resource material for the general physicians in primary care setting to provide them necessary know-how for assessment and management of these disorders. Pocket book on Standard Treatment Guidelines for Substance Use Disorders and Behavioural Addictions and Mobile APP (Android & iOS) \"Addiction-Rx\" has also been developed for assisting physicians to provide quality care in substance use disorders, under Drug De-Addiction Programme creation of tertiary healthcare capacity in medical education, research and clinical care, in the underserved areas of the country. It aims at correcting regional imbalances in the availability of affordable/reliable tertiary healthcare services and also augmenting facilities for quality medical education in the country. The scheme has two broad components: (i)Setting up of All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS); (ii)Up-gradation of existing Government Medical Colleges/Institutions (GMCIs). - So far, establishment of 22 new AIIMS and 75 up-gradation Projects of existing Government Medical Colleges/Institutions (GMCIs) have been approved under this scheme. 6.1 Six AIIMS under Phase-I: - Six AIIMS- Rishikesh) are already fully functional. All key hospital facilities and services such as OPD, IPD, Emergency, Trauma, Blood Bank, ICU, Diagnostic and Pathology are functioning. - The total bed capacity of 6 AIIMS is at present 5764 against the sanctioned bed capacity of 5760. - There are 612 PG seats and 750 MBBS seats in 6 AIIMS for Academic Year 2022-23. 6.2 New AIIMS under Phase-II, IV, V, VI & VII: - 16 AIIMS have been sanctioned/approved by the Cabinet in subsequent phases. Following facilities and services have been made functional in these institutes: - MBBS classes and OPD services started at following AIIMS at Gorakhpur these, IPD facilities on a limited scale have been started in current financial year 3550 hospital beds functional in these 9 AIIMS. - MBBS classes have started in ,Vijaypur (Jammu), and Madurai (Tamil Nadu). 6.3 Up-gradation of existing Government Medical Colleges /Institutes: - The Up-gradation programme broadly envisages improving tertiary health infrastructure through construction of Super Speciality Blocks / Trauma Care Centres etc. and/or procurement of medical equipment at/for existing Government Medical Colleges / Institution. - Since inception of the Scheme, 60 upgradation projects of existing Government Medical Colleges / Institutions have been completed, adding about 13982 Super-specialty beds including 2397 ICU beds. The Super Specialty Blocks /Trauma Centres constructed in these upgradation projects are also being used as COVID Hospital Blocks. The civil constructions of the following 6 projects have been completed during 2022-23 (upto November, 2022): | | S. No. | | Name of the GMC/ Institute | | Name of the State | | Phase | | Type of facility | | Total Beds | | ICU Beds | | No. of Super Specialties | | 1 | | Indira Gandhi Medical College, Shimla | | Himachal Pradesh | | III | | SSB | | 283 | | 53 | | 10 | | 2 | | TD Medical College, Alappuzha | | Kerala | | III | | SSB | | 279 | | 62 | | 9 | | 3 | | North Bengal Medical College, Siliguri, Darjeeling | | West Bengal | | III | | SSB | | 255 | | 89 | | 8 | | 4 | | GMC, Kanpur | | Uttar Pradesh | | IV | | SSB | | 270 | | 30 | | 12 | | 5 | | GMC, Jaipur | | Rajasthan | | IV | | SSB | | 231 | | 51 | | 5 | | 6 | | GMC, Bhavnagar | | Gujarat | | IV | | SSB | | 193 | | 47 | | 6 Setting up of Critical Care Hospital Blocks: - In order to avoid mixing of COVID and non COVID patients, at many places full hospitals were required to be designated as COVID dedicated facilities. To control spread of the infectious disease, The PM-ABHIM Scheme envisages establishment of 150 bedded Critical Care Hospital Blocks (CCHB) in 12 Central Hospitals under the Central Sector Component at a total cost of Rs. 2220 crores. These institutes include - Shillong and IMS of BHU at Varanasi. - The allocation under the scheme broadly translates to Rs. 120 crores as capital cost which includes civil construction, ICUs, HDUs, Dialysis, OTs, MGPS, CSSD, Hospital Beds and furniture and medical equipment. In addition, estimated operating expenses for salary of doctors and paramedics are Rs. 28.0 crore per annum and Rs. 12.0 crore per annum for other operating expenses on running the hospital services. The recurring cost will however be available after CCHB becomes functional and only upto 2025-26, after which Institutes will be expected to meet this requirement out of their regular budget. 7. Medical Education - The historic National Medical Commission Act was passed by the Parliament in August, 2019. Now, the National Medical Commission has been constituted with effect from 25th September, 2020 and the years old MCI has been dissolved and the Indian Medical Council Act, 1956 has been repealed. The principal change in the regulatory mechanism is that the regulator will be primarily 'selected' rather than 'elected'. The National Medical Commission will steer the reforms in medical education. This will include increase in UG & PG seats along with improved access to quality and affordable medical education and maintaining high ethical standards in medical profession. Some of the key areas in which NMC will work include - implementation of National Exit Test (NEXT) for the medical graduates, guidelines for determination of fee for 50% seats in private medical colleges and Deemed Universities, Regulations for Community Health Providers and rating of medical colleges. - During the last six years, MBBS Seats increased by 87%, from 51,348 seats in 2014 to 96,077 seats in 2022 and the number of PG seats increased by 105% from 2014 (31,185 seats) to 2022 (63,842 seats). - Further, during the same period, 261 new medical colleges have been established and now the country has 648 (Govt: 355, Pvt: 293) medical colleges. - Under the Central Sponsored Scheme for establishment of new medical colleges, establishment of 157 medical colleges have been approved in three phases, of which 93 are functional and remaining will be functional in a few years. Of these 157 colleges, 39 are coming up in the Aspirational Districts of the country thereby addressing the issues of inequity in medical education. - Rationalization of Minimum Standards Requirements (MSR): The MSRs for establishment of medical colleges have been streamlined. This will reduce the cost of establishment of new medical colleges and increase intake capacity. - Two years post MBBS Diplomas by National Board of Examinations: Keeping in view the importance of Diploma courses to meet the shortfall of postgraduate students and augment healthcare in remote parts of the country, the National Board of Examinations (NBE) has launched diplomas in eight disciplines namely - Anaesthesia, Gynaecology & Obstetrics, Pediatrics, ENT, Ophthalmology, Family Medicine, Tuberculosis & Chest Diseases and Medical Radiodiagnosis. - District Residency Scheme for Post-Graduation: The MCI has also notified a Scheme known as District Residency Scheme for compulsory three months training of PG medical students at District Hospitals, an essential component of postgraduate medical training curriculum. Under the Scheme, the second/third year PG students of medical colleges would be posted in the district hospitals for a period of three months. - The constitution of the National Medical Commission has ushered in a landmark reform in the sector of Medical Education. On similar lines, the Government is striving to bring institutional reforms in nursing and dental education sectors by bringing reformative legislations to replace the existing Indian Nursing Council Act, 1947 and Dentists Act, 1948. To address the long standing vacuum of a regulatory body for various professions included in the allied and healthcare sector, a National Commission for Allied and Healthcare Professions Act 2021 has already been enacted. The basic premise and principled change that is happening in all these professional education sectors is that the Regulator is now being 'selected on merits', as opposed to an 'elected' regulator. 8. Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), New Delhi, is the apex body in India for the formulation, coordination and promotion of biomedical research and is one of the oldest medical research bodies in the world now under the Department of Health Research (DHR) in the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Govt of India. The Council's research priorities coincide with the National health priorities such as control and management of communicable diseases, fertility control, maternal and child health, focussing on nutritional disorders, developing alternative strategies for health care delivery, containment within safety limits of environmental and occupational health problems; research on major non-communicable diseases like cancer, cardiovascular diseases, blindness, diabetes and other metabolic and haematological disorders; mental health and drug research (including traditional remedies). All these efforts are undertaken with a view to reduce the total burden of disease and to promote health and well-being of the population. ICMR has also demonstrated its commitment to the future of medical research through its professional development training and capacity building. This includes training programs, workshops, and short-term research studentships for those preparing for a career in medicine and medical research. It also includes research fellowships and short-term visiting fellowships for upcoming researchers to expand their skills and knowledge early in their career. ICMR also offers Emeritus Scientist positions to enable retired medical scientists and teachers to continue to carry out research on specific topics. The impact of ICMR spans across the globe with research collaborations spanning every continent. Through ICMR's Memoranda of Understandings (MoUs), ICMR has partnered with leading universities from around the world to concentrate efforts on leading health issues such as cancer, diabetes, infectious diseases, and vaccine development. These collaborations facilitate the exchange of scientific information, training, joint projects, and co-authorship of meetings, workshops, seminars, and symposia presentations. 8.1 Intramural Research Intramural research is carried out through a countrywide network of 27 institutes/centres with multiple field stations, 14 ICMR Institutes work in the area of communicable diseases; 6 in Non-Communicable Diseases, 1 in diseases related to Reproductive and Child Health (RCH); 1 in nutrition and nutritional deficiencies, 3 in disease related to Basic Medical Sciences including haemoglobinopathies and traditional medicine, 1 in the area of animal breeding and research and 1 is patient care and research centre. 8.2 Extramural Research Extramural research of ICMR is promoted through - Setting up Centres for Advanced Research in different research areas around existing expertise and infrastructure in selected departments of Medical Colleges, Universities and other non-ICMR Research Institutes. Task force studies are also carried out which emphasize a time-bound, goal-oriented approach with clearly defined targets, specific time frames, standardized and uniform methodologies, and often a multi-centric structure. Open-ended research on the basis of applications for grants-in-aid received from scientists in non-ICMR Research Institutes, Medical colleges, Universities etc. located in different parts of the country. 8.3 Achievements during the year: The major activities and achievements of ICMR are given below: Outbreak Investigation & Pandemic Preparedness - Monkey Pox: ICMR conducted the investigation and diagnosis of Monkey Pox Virus in India. It also isolated and cultured the MPV and called for LOI from companies for diagnostic kit and vaccine development. Memoranda of Understanding have been signed with three companies for the validation of the diagnostic kits for monkey pox. - Lumpy Skin disease in Cattle: Laboratory investigations for Lumpy Skin Disease Virus outbreak were developed to support the regional veterinary diagnostic laboratories. - Dealing with COVID-19 Pandemic: In the fight against COVID-19, the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), played the crucial role from setting of laboratory network across the country to isolating the virus, doing genetic characterization, genome sequencing, developing newer diagnostics, and research leading to the vaccine development in less than a year time which signifies our science capabilities. A pioneering initiative was undertaken to deliver vaccines and medical supplies through drones in difficult terrains. Recently, ICMR studies have demonstrated that appropriate use of non-rebreather masks during oxygen therapy in covid patients help reduce the risks of black fungus. Also, another study reported that vaccines saved hospitalized patients and prevented deaths. - Mobile BSL-3 Laboratory: India's first Biosafety level-3 containment mobile laboratory was launched in Nashik, Maharashtra. The mobile laboratory has been set up to investigate newly emerging and re-emerging viral infections that are highly infectious and of lethal potential to human beings in field settings. This initiative will propel the nation's scientific and diagnostic capability: a level unseen within Asia and ensure quick containment of Infectious Disease Outbreak. - Zonal NIVs Bharat Health Infrastructure Mission, the expansion of existing research capacity would be undertaken for infectious disease emergency preparedness. Provisions have been made in the budget to decentralize the load on National Institute of Virology, Pune through establishment of 4 regional national institute of virology in four regions (North, South, East and Central) of the country. Recently, foundation stones of 3 Zonal NIVs have been laid at Bengaluru, Jabalpur and Dibrugarh by Hon'ble President of India. These NIV will help in efficiently countering the threats of viral pandemics/epidemics in the future. To build biosafety and biosecurity enabled infrastructure, budget 2021 proposes to upgrade 5 viral research & diagnostics labs into BSL-III laboratories and setting up of 4 mobile BSL-III labs. These will be used in outbreak situations for rapid processing and testing of specimens related to vector borne, human, animal and environment etc. Promoting Make-in-India efforts: - Development of Indigenous diagnostic kits: ICMR developed world's first rapid, cost-effective kits to diagnose haemophilia, von Willebrand disease. In the conventional setting, it requires trained laboratory staff and equipment to diagnose these diseases, and involves a decent cost too. These facilities are not available in the remote areas of our country. However, in the newly developed rapid kit, 2 micro litre blood plasma sample needs to be dropped on a small strip to test for haemophilia, vWD and results are available within 10 minutes. Also, these kits will bring down the cost from current of Rs. 2,000 - Rs. 9,000 to around Rs 28 only. The kit has been approved by DCGI and technology has been transferred to Bhat Bio-Tech India (P) Ltd (BBI), Bangalore, for large scale manufacturing. - Large Animal Testing Facility at AMTZ: ICMR-DHR Centre of Excellence Large Animal House Facility has been established to bridge the critical gap for product development and fostering Make-In-India initiative at AMTZ, Vizag, Andhra Pradesh.

Disease Burden/ Surveillance - National TB Prevalence Survey: The National TB Prevalence Survey of India 2019-2021, the first of its kind in the country in 55 years, found that there are 312 cases per 100,000 population. The report says that for every notified case of the deadly infectious disease, the actual prevalent number of cases was 2.84. A majority of patients (64%) did not seek treatment, mostly because they ignored the symptoms or did not recognise them. All these findings would help in guiding policies towards TB elimination. - India Hypertension Research Initiative (IHMI): IHCI is ICMR's collaborative initiative with MoHFW, WHO & state governments aimed to reduce deaths from heart attacks & strokes. It is playing a critical role in regularizing hypertension treatment across primary care facilities in 100 districts in 23states by providing free drugs & quality treatment to 34lakh patients. This initiative is a progression towards ensuring availability of quality healthcare for Indians The tech driven innovations in the IHCI program allowed India to track over 2 million patients digitally, with minimal burden on human resources and on clinics. 50% patients tracked in real time achieved BP control. The initiative was awarded 2022 UN Inter-Agency Task Force and the WHO special program on Primary Health Care Award during United Nation General Assembly on 21st September 2022. - National List of Essential Medicines (NLEM): Recently, The National List of Essential Medicine (NLEM) was launched by Hon'ble HFM, Dr Mansukh Mandaviya. The revised NLEM was developed under the chairmanship of Secretary, DHR & DG, ICMR.

Introduction - The Government of India is currently implementing the phase-V of the National AIDS and STD Control Programme (NACP). Like the previous phase, NACP phase-V is a Central Sector Scheme fully funded by the Government of India from 1st April 2021 to 31st March 2026 with an outlay of Rs 15471.94 crore. The NACP phase-V will anchor the national AIDS and STD response in the country till 2025-26 towards the attainment of the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals 3.3 of ending the HIV/AIDS epidemic as a public health threat through a comprehensive package of prevention, detection, and treatment services. - NACP phase-V builds upon the game-changer initiatives undertaken during phase-IV including HIV/AIDS Prevention and Control Act (2017), Test and Treat Policy, Universal Viral Load Testing, Mission Sampark, Community-Based Screening, Transition to Dolutegravir-based Treatment Regimen etc. NACP phase-V introduces newer strategies consolidating and augmenting the gains to attain the stated goal by 2025-26. B. Prevention of new HIV infections - The reduction of new HIV infections by 80% is the first goal of NACP phase-V. Continued and augmented focus on high-risk groups, bridge population and 'at-risk' populations is the mainstay of the NACP approach for the reduction of new HIV infections. Under the programme, more than one crore of high-risk groups, bridge and other vulnerable populations were covered in the first year of NACP Phase-V i.e., 2021-22. In 2022-23, till September 2023, around 55 lakh high-risk groups, bridge and other vulnerable populations were covered through 1476 targeted interventions and 156 Link Worker Schemes in the country. - HIV prevalence among inmates in some States is higher than that among other HRG and bridge population groups. NACP phase-V calls for the universalization of the NACP interventions in prisons and other closed settings through a mix of service delivery models. In 2022-23, till September, NACP interventions offering both HIV and TB services, have reached 1538 institutions covering more than 5.50 lakh inmates. The programme has identified and provided treatment to more than 2200 HIV-positive cases and 400 TB cases in the group. - Sampoorna Suraksha Kendras are being set up for providing services through a single window model for the HIV-negative 'at-risk' population across the prevention-test-treat-care continuum to keep them In 2022-23, the Sampoorna Suraksha Model has been piloted at 10 centres in three States of the country. Now, in the first phase, the programme is expanding the Sampoorna Suraksha Model to additional 65 centres across the 10 States of the country. The operational manual for the model has been drafted and the M&E framework for the same is being worked out. - NACP phase-V does recognize the need to reach out to newer population groups to further expand the coverage of interventions, with a specific focus on the prevention of new HIV infections. Accordingly, it calls to develop and scale-up sustainable models for the 'at-risk' virtual population. NACO has recently released a White Paper on virtual interventions. The paper outlined the framework for virtual interventions with a specific focus on ethics, confidentiality and data security while indicating a potential mechanism for virtual outreach and service packages based on an extensive literature search. - NACP has engaged with various partners to test various models of interventions on virtual platforms to reach out to the group. This includes Global Fund supported 'NETREACH', and PEPFAR supported 'Safe Zindagi', 'Project Aspire' AIDS-related mortality - Reducing AIDS-related mortality by 80% is one of the five high-level goals of NACP phase-V. This would require 95% of HIV-infected people to know their HIV status, 90% to be on ART and 86% to be virally suppressed. NACP aims for accessible, affordable, and quality testing and treatment services as one of the building blocks for the attainment of reductions in AIDS-related mortality. Approaches of dual test kits (HIV & syphilis), dried-blood spot-based sample collection for viral load testing etc., will enhance the efficiency of the programme. - In 2021-21, around 4.80 crore HIV tests were done under NACP including around 2.48 crore tests among pregnant women. In the first six months of 2022-23, around 3.10 crore HIV tests have been undertaken in the programme through various models. Given the trend, it is expected that more than 6 crore HIV tests would be undertaken during 2022-23 in NACP Phase-V. This would be the highest since the launch of HIV counselling and testing services under NACP in India. - As on September 2022, around 16.24 lakh people living with HIV (PLHIV) were on anti-retroviral (ARV) treatment in the country. This is around 1.10 lakh more since September 2021 and the highest since the launch of ARV treatment under the National AIDS Control Programme in 2004. Most of them are on the most advanced, lifelong free Dolutegravir-based regimen which fast-tracks viral load suppression and significantly improves the quality of life. - To monitor and improve the quality of care for HIV-infected people, the Government of India launched a free routine viral load test for PLHIV in February 2018. The number of viral load tests under NACP is continuously increasing. In 2018-19, around 2.50 lakh viral load tests were done. In 2021-22, around 10.32 lakh viral load tests were done which is more than 4 times the tests done in 2018-19. - Quality laboratory services are critical enablers to the national AIDS and STI response with a central role across the prevention-detection-treatment cascade. The quality of laboratory services under NACP continues to be high. In 2021-22, among the laboratories and HIV counselling and testing centres participating in the quality assurance system, the discordance results were less than 0.10%. The six laboratories designated for early infant diagnosis scored a perfect 100% in the panel testing. - The outcome of quality testing and treatment services being offered under the programme has been significant. As on March 2022, almost 18.56 lakh PLHIV were aware of their HIV status in comparison to the 16.99 lakh PLHIV in March 2019. The number of PLHIV from 13.99 lakh in March 2019 to 15.56 lakh in March 2022. The proportion of PLHIV who were on-ART and virally suppressed increased from 72% in 2018-19 to 85% in 2021-22. D. Elimination of vertical transmission of HIV and syphilis - NACP phase-V calls for the attainment of the elimination of vertical transmission of HIV and Syphilis as one of the five top-level goals. This would require 95% of pregnant women are aware of their HIV and Syphilis Status. Till September 2022, almost 1.5 crore HIV testing among pregnant women was done against the target of 2.65 crore for the year. Around 1.2 crore Syphilis tests were done among pregnant women in the same period against the annual target of 1.91 crore. - NACP is further developing a dedicated strategic roadmap to fast-track the progress on the elimination of vertical transmission. NACO has constituted a technical working group for a unified approach responding to both HIV and Syphilis. The strategic roadmap will review and update the strategies and operational flow in line with the NACP phase-V priorities. E. Universal access to quality management of sexually transmitted infections (STI)/ reproductive tract infections (RTI) services - Sexually Transmitted Infections are indicative of ongoing unprotected high-risk sexual intercourse. For areas where HIV infection is not well established, the high prevalence of STI is an early warning of the epidemic potential of HIV from sexual transmission. Besides, one of the STIs, syphilis is of particular concern for maternal and child health given the commitment toward the elimination of congenital syphilis. - Given the associations, the management of STI/RTI is one of the focus areas under NACP since its first phase. NACP phase-V has reinforced the focus on STI management by including it as one of the five high-level goals. Goal 4 of the NACP phase-V calls for the promotion of universal access to quality STI/RTI services to at-risk and vulnerable populations through a ten-prong strategy. - NACP phase-V intends to augment the role of the Suraksha Clinics, the network of designated STI/RTI clinics delivering STI services following a syndromic management approach, to anchor newer initiatives like the Sampoorna Suraksha Strategy and integrated service delivery tailored to the local contexts. As a cross-cutting facility, these clinics, in their Sampoorna Suraksha avatar, will evolve into an integrated facility anchoring the country's progress on the prevention of new infections, reduction of AIDS-related mortality, elimination of vertical transmission and promotion of access to STI/RTI services. - In the second year of implementation, NACP phase-V aimed to manage 1.06 crore patients for STI/RTI. During April-September 2022, around 42 lakh clients were managed for STI/RTI episodes under the programme. - NACO is leveraging improved laboratory technologies to enable equal access to integrated services for HIV and syphilis. NACP phase- V has adopted the rapid dual test kit for HIV & syphilis, with a specific framework on follow-up testing and treatment algorithms, increasing testing uptake in a very cost-efficient manner. F. Elimination of HIV/AIDS-related stigma and discrimination - Building upon the gamechanger initiatives and in line with Government elimination of HIV/AIDS-related stigma and discrimination as one of the five top-level goals. - The strategies adopted under the NACP have always kept the HRG and PLHIV at the centre of its response. With the notification of the HIV/AIDS (Prevention and Control) Act 2017 and the decriminalization of section 377 of the Indian Penal Code, the country has brought significant structural changes to eliminate HIV/AIDS-related stigma and discrimination. - The Government of India has notified the HIV and AIDS Policy for Establishments 2022 which provides a framework to mitigate issues surrounding HIV and AIDS in a workplace setting and encourages action on part of the employer, employee and establishments to eliminate HIV-related stigma and discrimination. Additionally, nine Central Government Guidelines under the HIV and AIDS (Prevention & Control) Act, 2017 have also been notified. Twenty-seven States/UT has appointed an ombudsman at the State level who is responsible to handle cases of HIV-related stigma and discrimination. G. Break the silos, build synergies - 'Break the silos, build synergies' is a guiding principle of the NACP phase-V. This asks for the offering of a basket of tailored integrated services across the prevention-detection-treatment spectrum. This means establishing functional referrals and linkages for the management of relevant communicable and non-communicable diseases, sexual & reproductive health, and mental health through coordinated systems. - NACP has made significant progress in engagement with National Health Mission, National Viral Hepatitis Control Programme and National Viral Hepatitis Surveillance Programme while strengthening the collaboration with National Tuberculosis Elimination Programme. Hepatitis B and Hepatitis C have been integrated as additional biomarkers in our robust Surveillance Systems. NACO is also working with the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment for an integrated package of service delivery through linkages for people who use drugs. - NACP phase-V has augmented the systematized convergence with the existing schemes of the Central Government including synergy with National Health Programmes and related ministries. So far, the Memoranda of Understanding have been signed with 18 key departments and ministries of the Government of India. Taking the national AIDS response beyond the prevention-testing-treatment spectrum, the programme has engaged with State Governments and other stakeholders to offer social protection schemes for the infected and affected. The State AIDS Control Societies have engaged with key departments so that the affected population are linked with various social protection schemes addressing inequalities and facilitating a dignified life. Twenty-six States and UTs are providing financial support to the people infected with HIV and to their families. H. Evidence-driven response - NACP phase-V has continued to augment and harness its robust strategic information systems of programme monitoring, surveillance & epidemiology, and research & evaluation for evidence-led interventions improving the directions and results under the programme. - The integrated and enhanced surveillance and epidemiology have provided crucial evidence on the level and trends of HIV, Syphilis and related co-infections of Hepatitis B and Hepatitis C in eight population groups. The evidence thus generated has helped the programme to build clusters in each State of the country to anchor the AIDS response through the District Integrated Strategy for HIV/AIDS (DISHA). In July 2022, NACO launched the DISHA strategy revamping the district-level monitoring and implementation mechanism under NACP Phase-V. - To strengthen evidence-led planning and implementation, NACO has institutionalized operational research at the State level. Further, NACP brought in newer evidence through two national consultations and undertook pilots on newer concepts such as pre-exposure prophylaxis, HIV interventions for at-risk populations in virtual spaces, and HIV self-testing. - Dissemination is one of the core functions of strategic information management under NACP. The national technical guidelines on pre-exposure prophylaxis and the White Paper on strategies for engaging with HIV at-risk populations in virtual spaces have been released. On the occasion of World AIDS Day 2022, NACP has further released the fourth edition of the 'Sankalak-Status of the National AIDS response', and the technical reports from the 2021 round of HIV surveillance and estimations. I. Impact - As a result of strong political leadership, evidence-led policies and strategic implementations, the national AIDS response has been highly successful. As per the latest HIV Estimates of the Government of India, HIV prevalence in India continues to be low with an adult prevalence of 0.21% in 2021. The annual new HIV infections have declined by 46% between 2010 and 2021, against the global average of 32%; and the AIDS-related mortalities have declined by 76%, against the global average of 52%. 13. E-Health National Telemedicine Services The National Telemedicine Service \"eSanjeevani\" is a digital health initiative of the Ministry supports two types of teleconsultation services-Doctor-to-Doctor (eSanjeevani) and Patient-to-Doctor (eSanjeevani OPD) Tele-consultations. eSanjeevani was rolled out in November 2019 as an important component of the Ayushman Bharat Health and Wellness Centre (AB-HWCs) programme. It aims to implement tele-consultation in all the 1.5 lakh Health and Wellness Centres in a 'Hub and Spoke' model, by December 2022. NHM in States identify and set up dedicated 'Hubs' in Medical Colleges and District hospitals to enable tele-consultations services to 'Spokes', set up at SHCs and PHCs. In wake of COVID 19 Pandemic, on the 13th April 2020, the MoHFW rolled out 'eSanjeevaniOPD' first of its kind to facilitate online health services to patients directly in the confines of their home at no cost to ensure continuity of care. eSanjeevani has completed around 7.7 crore consultations. Over 3,50,000 patients are seeking health services on a daily basis in 36 States/UTs. The top ten States which have registered highest consultations through eSanjeevani and eSanjeevaniOPD platforms (ABDM): In year 2019, Ministry of Health and Family Welfare released National Digital Health Blueprint (NDHB) as an architectural framework for effective implementation of Digital Health interventions. With a vision to create a national digital health ecosystem as proposed in NDHB, on 15th August 2020, Hon'ble Prime Minister Shri [Narendra Modi](https://www.financialexpress.com/tag/narendra-modi/) announced the launch of the National Digital Health Mission (now known as Ayushman Bharat Digital Mission) in six union territories (Andaman & Nicobar Islands, Chandigarh, Puducherry) on pilot basis. Three key registries of NDHM namely Health ID, Health Professional Registry (HPR), Health Facility Registry (HFR) and digital infrastructure for data exchange have been developed and implemented in these UTs. On 27th September, 2021, the Hon'ble Prime Minister announced the nationwide rollout of the Ayushman Bharat Digital Mission (ABDM) (earlier known as National Digital Health Mission) with aims to develop the backbone necessary to support the integrated digital health infrastructure of the country. 14.
