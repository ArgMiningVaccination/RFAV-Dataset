EPA is committed to supporting states and public water systems as they determine the appropriate steps to reduce exposure to PFOA and PFOS in drinking water. As science on health effects of these chemicals evolves, EPA will continue to evaluate new evidence. Background on PFOA and PFOS PFOA and PFOS are fluorinated organic chemicals that are part of a larger group of chemicals referred to as perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs). PFOA and PFOS have been the most extensively produced and studied of these chemicals. They have been used to make carpets, clothing, fabrics for furni - ture, paper packaging for food and other materials (e.g., cookware) that are resistant to water, grease or stains. They are also used for firefighting at air- fields and in a number of industrial processes. Because these chemicals have been used in an array of consumer products, most people have been exposed to them. Between 2000 and 2002, PFOS was voluntarily phased out of production in the U.S. by its primary manufac - turer. In 2006, eight major companies voluntarily agreed to phase out their global production of PFOA and PFOA -related chemicals, although there are a limited number of ongoing uses. Scientists have found PFOA and PFOS in the blood of nearly all the people they tested, but these studies show that the levels of PFOA and PFOS in blood have been decreasing. While consumer products and food are a large source of exposure to these chemicals for most people, drinking water can be an additional source in the small per- centage of communities where these chemicals have contaminated water supplies. Such contamination is typically localized and associated with a spe- cific facility, for example, an industrial facility where these chemicals were produced or used to manufacture other products or an airfield at which they were used for firefighting. EPA's 2016 Lifetime Health Advisories EPA develops health advisories to provide information on contaminants that can cause human health effects and are known or anticipated to occur in drinking water. EPA's health advisories are non-enforceable and non-regulatory and provide technical information to states agencies and other public health officials on health effects, analytical methodologies, and treatment technologies associated with drinking water contam - ination. In 2009, EPA published provisional health advisories for PFOA and PFOS based on the evidence avail - able at that time. The science has evolved since then and EPA is now replacing the 2009 provisional adviso - ries with new, lifetime health advisories. November 2016 EPA 800-F-16-003 US Environmental Protection Agency 2 FACT SHEET PFOA & PFOS Drinking Water Health Advisories EPA's 2016 Lifetime Health Advisories, continued To provide Americans, including the most sensitive populations, with a margin of protection from a life- time of exposure to PFOA and PFOS from drinking water, EPA established the health advisory levels at 70 parts per trillion. When both PFOA and PFOS are found in drinking water, the co m b i n ed concentrations of PFOA and PFOS should be compared with the 70 parts per trillion health advisory level. This health advi- sory level offers a margin of protection for all Americans throughout their life from adverse health effects resulting from exposure to PFOA and PFOS in drinking water. How the Health Advisories were developed EPA's health advisories are based on the best available peer -reviewed studies of the effects of PFOA and PFOS on laboratory animals (rats and mice) and were also informed by epidemiological studies of human populations that have been exposed to PFASs. These studies indicate that exposure to PFOA and PFOS over certain levels may result in adverse health effects, including developmental effects to fetuses during preg - nancy or to brea stfed infants (e.g., low birth weight, accelerated puberty, skeletal variations), cancer (e.g., testicular, kidney), liver effects (e.g., tissue damage), immune effects (e.g., antibody production and im- munity), thyroid effects and other effects (e.g., cholesterol changes). EPA's health advisory levels were calculated to offer a margin of protection against adverse health effects to the most sensitive populations: fetuses during pregnancy and breastfed infants. The health advisory lev- els are calculated based on the drinking water intake of lactating women, who drink more water than other people and can pass these chemicals along to nursing infants through breastmilk. Recommended Actions for Drinking Water Systems Steps to Assess Contamination If water sampling results confirm that drinking water contains PFOA and PFOS at individual or combined concentrations greater than 70 parts per trillion, water systems should quickly undertake additional sam- pling to assess the level, scope and localized source of contamination to inform next steps Steps to Inform If water sampling results confirm that drinking water contains PFOA and PFOS at individual or combined concentrations greater than 70 parts per trillion, water systems should promptly notify their State drinking water safety agency (or with EPA in jurisdictions for which EPA is the primary drinking water safety agency) and consult with the relevant agency on the best approach to conduct additional sampling. Drinking water systems and public health officials should also promptly provide consumers with infor - mation about the levels of PFOA and PFOS in their drinking water. This notice should include specific infor - mation on the risks to fetuses during pregnancy and breastfed and formula -fed infants from exposure to drinking water with an individual or combined concentration of PFOA and PFOS above EPA's health adviso - ry level of 70 parts per trillion. In addition, the notification should include actions they are taking and identi - fy options that consumers may consider to reduce risk such as seeking an alternative drinking water source, or in the case of parents of formula -fed infants, using formula that does not require adding water. November 2016 EPA 800-F-16-003 US Environmental Protection Agency 3 FACT SHEET PFOA & PFOS Drinking Water Health Advisories Recommended Actions for Drinking Water Systems, continued Steps to Limit Exposure A number of options are available to drinking water systems to lower concentrations of PFOA and PFOS in their drinking water supply. In some cases, drinking water systems can reduce concentrations of perfluo - roalkyl substances, including PFOA and PFOS, by closing contaminated wells or changing rates of blending of water sources. Alternatively, public water systems can treat source water with activated carbon or high pressure membrane systems (e.g., reverse osmosis) to remove PFOA and PFOS from drinking water. These treatment systems are used by some public water systems today, but should be carefully designed and maintained to ensure that they are e ffective for treating PFOA and PFOS. In some communities, entities have provided bottled water to consumers while steps to reduce or remove PFOA or PFOS from drinking water or to establish a new water supply are completed. Many h ome drinking water treatment units are certified by independent accredited third party organizations against American National Standards Institute (ANSI) standards to verify their contaminant removal claims. NSF International (NSF\u00ae) has developed a protocol for NSF/ANSI Standards 53 and 58 that establish es minimum requirements for materials, design and construction, and performance of point -of-use (POU) activated carbon drinking water treatment systems and reverse osmosis system s that are designed to reduce PFOA and PFOS in public water supplies . The protocol has been established to certify systems (e.g., home treatment systems) that meet the minimum requirements . The systems are evaluated for contaminant reduction by challenging them with an influent of 1 .5\u00b130% \u00b5g/L (total of both PFOA and PFOS ) and must reduce this concentration by more than 95% to 0.07 \u00b5g/L or less (total of both PFOA and PFOS) throughout the manufacturer's stated life of the treatment system. Product certification to this protocol for testing home treatment systems verifies that device s effectively re duces PFOA and PFOS to acceptable levels. Other Actions Relating to PFOA and PFOS Between 2000 and 2002, PFOS was voluntarily phased out of production in the U.S. by its primary manufac - turer, 3M. EPA also issued regulations to limit future manufacturing, including importation, of PFOS and its precursors, without first having EPA review the new use. A limited set of existing uses for PFOS (fire re- sistant aviation hydraulic fluids, photography and film products, photomicrolithography process to produce semiconductors, metal finishing and plating baths, component of an etchant) was excluded from these reg- ulations because these uses were ongoing and alternatives were not available. In 2006, EPA asked eight major companies to commit to working toward the elimination of their production and use of PFOA, and chemicals that degrade to PFOA, from emissions and products by the end of 2015. All eight companies have indicated that they have phased out PFOA, and chemicals that degrade to PFOA, from emissions and products by the end of 2015. Additionally, PFOA is included in EPA's proposed Toxic Substance Control Act's Significant New Use Rule (SNUR) issued in January 2015 which will ensure that EPA has an opportunity to review any efforts to reintroduce the chemical into the marketplace and take action, as necessary, to address potential concerns. November 2016 EPA 800-F-16-003 US Environmental Protection Agency 4 FACT SHEET PFOA & PFOS Drinking Water Health Advisories Other Actions Relating to PFOA and PFOS, continued EPA has not established national primary drinking water regulations for PFOA and PFOS. EPA is evaluating PFOA and PFOS as drinking water contaminants in accordance with the process required by the Safe Drink - ing Water Act (SDWA). To regulate a contaminant under SDWA, EPA must find that it: (1) may have adverse health effects; (2) occurs frequently (or there is a substantial likelihood that it occurs frequently) at levels of public health concern; and (3) there is a meaningful opportunity for health risk reduction for people served by public water systems. EPA included PFOA and PFOS among the list of contaminants that water systems are required to monitor under the third Unregulated Contaminant Monitoring Rule (UCMR 3) in 2012. Results of this monitoring effort are updated regularly and can be found on the publicly -available National Contaminant Occurrence Database (NCOD) ( a-u n regu lat ed-con t amin ant-mon it or in g- ru le# 3 ). In accordance with SDWA, EPA will consider the occurrence data from UCMR 3, along with the peer reviewed health effects assessments supporting the PFOA and PFOS Health Advisories, to make a reg - ulatory determination on whether to initiate the process to develop a national primary drinking water regu - lation. In addition, EPA plans to begin a separate effort to determine the range of PFAS for which an Integrated Risk Information System (IRIS) assessment is needed. The IRIS Program identifies and characterizes the health hazards of chemicals found in the environment. IRIS assessments inform the first two steps of the risk assessment process: hazard identification, and dose -response. As indicated in the 2015 IRIS Multi -Year Agenda, the IRIS Program will be working with other EPA offices to determine the range of PFAS com - pounds and the scope of assessment required to best meet Agency needs. More about this effort can be found at h ttp s:// www.ep a.gov/ iris/ iris-agen to PFOA and PFOS These health advisories only apply to exposure scenarios involving drinking water. They are not appropriate for use, in identifying risk levels for ingestion of food sources, including : fish, meat produced from livestock that consumes contaminated water, or crops irrigated with contaminated water. The health advisories are based on exposure from drinking water ingestion, not from skin contact or breathing. The advisory values are calculated based on drinking water consumption and household use of drinking water during food preparation (e.g., cooking or to prepare coffee, tea or soup). To develop the advisories , EPA considered non -drinking water sources of exposure to PFOA and PFOS, including: air, food, dust, and consumer products. In January 2016 the Food and Drug Administration amended its regulations to no longer all ow PFOA and PFOS to be added in food packaging, which will likely decrease one source of non -drinking water exposure.

To support the board , the Department of Health (department) developed draft recommendations for state action levels (SAL) for five PFAS detected in Washington drinking water. The SALs represent health protective levels expected to be without appreciable health effects over a lifetime of exposure for the general population , including in sensitive subgroups . Determining health protective values The five PFAS with SALs (see Table 1 , next pag e) are the best studied of the PFAS commonly detected in our state's drinking water. Our approach to developing SAL s involved evaluation of the primary PFAS scientific literature and review of recent assessments by federal agencies and several U.S. states. We selected health protective values from high-quality recent science assessments. We found sufficient information to recommend SAL s for PFOA, PFOS, PFNA, PFHxS, and PFBS. Because the first four of these PFAS are highly bioaccumulative in humans and may harm development , the SALs account for unique PFAS exposure pathways of early life stages including placental and lac tational transfer using a peer-reviewed model developed by the Minnesota Department of Health. The PFBS SAL has been revised to account for the higher intake of drinking water by infants. The health protective values for these five PFAS were derived from s tudies in laboratory animals with support from epidemiological data when available. The primary health concerns with these PFAS are reproductive and developmental toxicity, immune toxicity, liver toxicity, alterations in thyroid hormone levels, and altered serum lipids. PFOA is considered \"possibly carcinogenic to humans\" by the International Agency for Research on Cancer. Carcinogenicity of other PFAS is less studied. The SAL s in Table 1 define a level in daily drinking water expected to be without appreci able health effects for any of these outcomes . They are comparable to a health advisory level or maximum contaminant level goal (MCLG) in the federal Safe Drinking Water Act. Taking action at these levels is consistent with the mission of providing safe an d reliable drinking water. 2 Table 1 Draft SAL for PFAS Individual PFAS Draft State Action Level for Drinking Water 10 ng/L PFAS frequently appear as mixtures in drinking water. Use of these five SALs, together with the broad mitigation technolog ies available, provides a reasonable initial approach to protect the public from PFAS mixtures in drinking water. Less is known about the other PFAS although many can be removed by the same mitigation technolog ies employed to remove the PFAS with SALs. When water systems take public health action based on a PFAS SAL, we encourage them to choose mitigation options that are effective at re moving many PFAS such as activated granular carbon and anion exchange resin filtration. Ultimately, a more comprehensive grouped approach to regulation is preferred to a chemical -by-chemical approach given the large size of the PFAS class of chemicals. As the science advances, PFAS could be grouped according to subclasses based on key characteristics such as chemical structure, bioavailability, bioaccumulation potential, toxicity, or mechanism of action. We will consider a grouped approach to regulating PFA S mixtures if a method becomes available that is supported by science. We prepared a much more detailed te chnical support document that describes our approach , assumptions , and the derivation of each PFAS SAL. This is available at our PFAS rulemkaing webpage .
