Clin Infect Dis ; 75(1): e675-e682, 2022 covidwho-1722272 ABSTRACT BACKGROUND:Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) [vaccines]are implemented worldwide in efforts to curb the [pandemic]. This study investigates the [risk]of a positive [severe acute syndrome coronavirus 488) were obtained from national [registries]. [PCR]testing was free and widely available. The number of positive [PCR]tests per individual at [risk]was calculated as weekly rates. [Time]to positive [PCR]test was modelled using Kaplan-Meier [methods]and [hazard]ratios (HRs) Cox regression. RESULTS:A total of 1\u00e2 119\u00e2 received a second [dose]of [BNT162b2]. Individuals were followed up to 8.7 months after first [dose](median 5.5 months; interquartile ratio 4.1-8.7). Rates of the second [dose]were 0.21, 0.33, and 0.36 per 1000 individuals per week at [risk]for July, August, and September, respectively. Four or more months after the second [dose], the rates were 0.56, 0.76, and 0.53 per 1000 individuals per week at [risk]for July, August, and September, respectively. HR of SARS-CoV-2 infection after the second [dose]was 0.2 (95% [confidence [risk]of [breakthrough infection]after up to 8 months of follow-up. However, there was a tendency toward higher rates follow-up. LILACS LIS "}
