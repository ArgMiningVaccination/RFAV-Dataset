About 8 out of 10 new patients have superficial tumours. Invasive - the cancer has spread into the muscle layer and beyond. The deeper the cancer grows into the bladder wall, the more difficult it is to treat. For this reason, it is important to diagnose and treat the disease at an early stage. Types of bladder cancer A Wikipedia2 Your Guide to Bladder Instillation TreatmentSuperficial Bladder Tumours There are 2 types of superficial bladder cancer. They can happen on their own or in combination with each other: Papillary tumours are small, finger-like tumours. They have a tiny stem that attaches to the inner layer of the bladder. They often grow toward the centre or hollow part of the bladder without growing into the deeper layers Carcinoma in situ (CIS) - these tumours run flat along the lining of the bladder Superficial bladder cancer can be treated by putting medications directly into the bladder. This is called bladder instillation or intravesical therapy . The medications work on tumour cells on the inner lining of the bladder to help keep the cancer from coming back (recurrence). It is a treatment often used after surgery. There are 2 different types of medications that can be used: 1. Immunotherapy Your body's immune system cells switch on to find cancer cells that may be left in your bladder. This helps to stop new tumours from growing. You will usually get weekly treatments for 6 weeks. Your doctor will then decide about future treatments. BCG (Bacillus Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin) BCG is a type of vaccine made from an inactive form of the tuberculosis bacteria. When BCG is placed in your bladder, it irritates the cells in the bladder lining.Treatment for superficial bladder cancer B Check off the medication you will be having 3 Your Guide to Bladder Instillation Treatment2.
