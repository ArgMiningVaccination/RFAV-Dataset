Procedures should be in place to avoid falling injury and to restore cerebral perfusion following syncope - Solicited local adverse reactions reported in individuals aged 50 years and older were pain (78%), redness (38%), and swelling (26%) - Solicited general adverse reactions reported in individuals aged 50 years and older were myalgia (45%), fatigue (45%), headache (38%), shivering (27%), fever (21%), and gastrointestinal symptoms (17%) - Solicited local adverse reactions reported in autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients (aged 18 to 49 and 50 years of age) were pain (88% and 83%), redness (30% and 35%), and swelling (21% and 18%) - Solicited general adverse reactions reported in autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients (aged 18 to 49 and 50 years of age) were fatigue (64% and 54%), myalgia 25%), and fever (28% and 18%) - The data are insufficient to establish if there is vaccine-associated risk with SHINGRIX in pregnant women - It is not known whether SHINGRIX is excreted in human milk. Data are not available to assess the effects of SHINGRIX on the breastfed infant or on milk production/excretion - Vaccination with SHINGRIX may not result in protection of all vaccine recipients "}
